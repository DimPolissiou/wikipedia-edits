The band's third album ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' was released in December 2005 in Germany and January 2006 elsewhere.

Formed in New York City in 1999, the group consists of singer [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarists [[Nick Valensi]] and [[Albert Hammond Jr.]], bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]] and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]]. The Strokes [[discography]] consists of six [[studio album]]s, two [[extended play]]s (EP), twelve [[single (music)|single]]s, one video album and eighteen [[music video]]s.\n\nIn January 2001, the Strokes released a [[Demo (music)|demo]] EP, ''[[The Modern Age]]'', on [[independent record label]] [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]. The large amount of hype generated by the record, especially among the British music press, led to a bidding war among [[major record label]]s.<ref>Phares, Heather.

Retrieved on May 21, 2008.</ref> The band signed with [[RCA Records]], and released its debut LP ''[[Is This It]]'' in October 2001. Helped by lead single \"[[Hard to Explain]]\", the album debuted at number two in the [[UK Albums Chart|UK]] and number 33 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Highly acclaimed by critics, ''Is This It'' was certified platinum in the US and UK, selling over two million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"pitchfork\">Deusner, Stephen M. (January 3, 2006).

The album did well on the charts, reaching number two and going platinum in the UK, while peaking at the fourth spot in the US. Three singles were released from the album, the highest-charting of which was \"[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]\", which reached number seven in the UK. The band's third album ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' was released in December 2005 in Germany and January 2006 elsewhere. Although critics suggested the post-Christmas release date was an indication of the band's lower expectations of the record, it was the first Strokes album to top the UK charts.<ref name=\"pitchfork\"/> \"[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]\" became the first single by the group to break into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was its highest-charting effort in Britain, where it reached number five.\n\nReleased after a long hiatus, The Strokes' fourth album ''[[Angles (The Strokes album)|Angles]]'' (2011) became their third consecutive LP to chart at number four on the ''Billboard'' 200. Its 2013 follow-up ''[[Comedown Machine]]'' reached number ten on both the U.S. and British charts.

{"title_page": "Holy Corner (Begijnhof Ghent)", "text_new": "The '''Holy Corner''' is the English name for the '''Oud begijnhof''' or '''Old Saint Elisabeth''' [[beguinage]] in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. It is one of three beguinages in the city - the other two are the [[Groot Begijnhof Sint-Amandsberg|new Saint Elisabeth beguinage]] in the suburb of Sint-Amandsberg and [[Our-Lady Ter Hooyen|Our Lady Ter Hooyen]] in the Lange Violettenstraat. Both Saint Elisabeth beguinages were named after [[Elisabeth of Hungary]], also known as Saint Elisabeth of Thuringia.\n\n== Location ==\n[[Image:Entrance2holycornerGent.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Entrance to Ghent Holy Corner from the Burgstraat]]\n[[File:Gent Begijnhof 001.JPG|thumb|right|220px|\"Groothuis\" and \"Infirmerie\" of the former ''Sint-Elisabethbegijnhof'', now the [[Primary education|basisschool]] ''De Muze'']]\nHoly Corner is a protected [[Cityscape|urban heritage site]]. It is now a largely urban neighbourhood in the northeast of Ghent, close to the Rabot (originally a Spanish fortification, now a Ghent neighbourhood as well), between the Burgstraat and the Begijnhoflaan.\n\nHoly Corner can easily be reached by general transport. Since its newest addition is the [[Russian Orthodox church]], it is notable that tram 4, the quickest connection from Ghent railway station, has as its final destination the Ghent neighbourhood of [[Moscou (Ghent)|Moscou]].\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 13th century, a number of devout, unmarried and lay women, who had been helping the [[Cistercian]] sisters with their medical work, were given their own premises by Countess [[Jeanne of Flanders|Joanna of Constantinople]], daughter to [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin IX of Flanders]], who also helped with the construction of the Hospital in [[Lille]] named after her ([[L'hospice de la Comtesse Jeanne]], built in 1236).\n\nThe beguinage constructed in 1234, and soon named after Saint-Elisabeth who was canonized in 1236, grew into a little town of its own, with a church, a \"Grootjuffer\" house, an infirmary (with its own chapel), 18 convents, a big laundry meadow (used by the beguines who took in laundry of rich Ghent inhabitants) and a large orchard.\n\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], the city of Ghent acquired the property rights to the beguinage (on the legal provision of having to subsidize and maintain it). This actually happened to all church property in Belgium, but as the beguinage was not solely an area used for religious activities, the city of Ghent repeatedly tried to incorporate it in new development, as Ghent was experiencing the effects of the [[Industrial revolution]] and needed cheap housing for its increasing working force.\n\nAfter a number of beguines voluntarily settled in a new beguinage at Our Lady Ter Hoyen, the conflict between the Saint Elisabeth beguinage and the town administration dominated by the [[Liberalism in Belgium|liberal party]] became intense. Thanks to financial sponsoring by the [[Duke of Arenberg]] (also known as the Prinz von Recklinghausen) in two years' time (1872\u20131874) a new beguinage was built at the then still independent village of Sint-Amandsberg. On September 29, 1874, more than 600 beguines left Ghent for Sint-Amandsberg, in carriages provided by the Ghent Roman Catholic aristocracy.\n\n== After 1874 ==\n[[Image:Pravoslavye Gent.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Orthodox Church of Saint-Andrew in the Van Akenstraat]]\nAfter the departure of the beguines, the beguinage became a social housing area. There was less investment in infrastructure and accommodation and the area became a prime example of [[urban decay]].\n\nHowever, in the 20th century, some voices started to be heard that clamoured for the preservation of this unique urban site. Thanks to this, both private enterprise and the town of Ghent started to invest more into local housing, and from 1984 on the neighbourhood even began to feel the effects of [[gentrification]]. As often, artists were the first to come here: [[Constant Permeke]], [[Albert Servaes]] and [[Frits Van den Berghe]] all once lived at Van Akenstraat, 7 (but not simultaneously).\n\nIn English, the neighbourhood is commonly known as \"Holy Corner\". The name was originally coined by the late local Church of England vicar, Cameron Walker, who was of [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent, and who with this name may have hinted at [[Holy Corner]] in [[Edinburgh]]. At the time, the neighbourhood was the location of four churches of four different nominations: the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Saint Elisabeth Church, which was originally the beguinage church, the [[Orthodox Church]] of [[Saint Andrew]], the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] Rabot Church and the Saint John's [[Anglican Church]]. The four churches share an [[Ecumenical]] Whitsun walk. Though the area has been largely gentrified, on Sunday mornings practically every European and African language can be heard in its streets, since many Russians, Greeks, Ukrainians, Romanians, Serbs, Ethiopians, ... come to worship at the Orthodox Church, the Anglican church attracts Africans (and some other Christian foreigners who do not understand Dutch, the vernacular of the other two churches in the neighbourhood) and the Protestant church has Dutch, Africans and some [[East Europeans]] among its worshippers. However, in the summer of 2008, the Anglican church moved to a chapel in the neighbouring Theresianenstraat, just outside the Holy Corner, to return in January 2016. At the end of 2015, to offset a big drop in attendance at Roman Catholic churches in Ghent, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ghent had disaffected a number of Roman Catholic church buildings. The Saint Elisabeth church building was then taken over by the Anglican community, which had in the meantime outgrown its location in the Theresianenstraat. The first fully Anglican church service of the \"Saint Elisabeth\u2019s Anglican Church (the Parish of St. John\u2019s)\" took place on Sunday, January 24th 2016 (after an ecumenical one on the 17th).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Holy Corner]] in Edinburgh.\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070516091359/http://www.elisabethbegijnhof.be/english_main.html Saint Elisabeth Group Website]\n*[http://users.skynet.be/gent-stad/S_SE.html the old Saint Elisabeth page (in Dutch) on the website of the Roman Catholic Church in Ghent]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090414111638/http://orthodoxe-kerk-gent.skynetblogs.be/ Orthodox St Andrew Church Website (in Dutch)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070104094917/http://www.vpkb.be/gent-rabot/ Protestant Rabot church website (in Dutch)]\n*[http://www.saintjohnsghent.com Saint Elisabeth\u2019s Anglican Church (the Parish of St. John\u2019s) website]\n\n{{coord|51|03|26|N|3|42|43|E|type:landmark_region:BE_source:nlwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Holy Corner (Ghent Beguinage)}}\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Ghent]]\n[[Category:Beguinages]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Holy Corner''' is the English name for the '''Oud begijnhof''' or '''Old Saint Elisabeth''' [[beguinage]] in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]].

On September 29, 1874, more than 600 beguines left Ghent for Sint-Amandsberg, in carriages provided by the Ghent Roman Catholic aristocracy.\n\n== After 1874 ==\n[[Image:Pravoslavye Gent.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Orthodox Church of Saint-Andrew in the Van Akenstraat]]\nAfter the departure of the beguines, the beguinage became a social housing area. There was less investment in infrastructure and accommodation and the area became a prime example of [[urban decay]].\n\nHowever, in the 20th century, some voices started to be heard that clamoured for the preservation of this unique urban site. Thanks to this, both private enterprise and the town of Ghent started to invest more into local housing, and from 1984 on the neighbourhood even began to feel the effects of [[gentrification]]. As often, artists were the first to come here: [[Constant Permeke]], [[Albert Servaes]] and [[Frits Van den Berghe]] all once lived at Van Akenstraat, 7 (but not simultaneously).\n\nIn English, the neighbourhood is commonly known as \"Holy Corner\". The name was originally coined by the late local Church of England vicar, Cameron Walker, who was of [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent, and who with this name may have hinted at [[Holy Corner]] in [[Edinburgh]]. At the time, the neighbourhood was the location of four churches of four different nominations: the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Saint Elisabeth Church, which was originally the beguinage church, the [[Orthodox Church]] of [[Saint Andrew]], the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] Rabot Church and the Saint John's [[Anglican Church]]. The four churches share an [[Ecumenical]] Whitsun walk. Though the area has been largely gentrified, on Sunday mornings practically every European and African language can be heard in its streets, since many Russians, Greeks, Ukrainians, Romanians, Serbs, Ethiopians, ... come to worship at the Orthodox Church, the Anglican church attracts Africans (and some other Christian foreigners who do not understand Dutch, the vernacular of the other two churches in the neighbourhood) and the Protestant church has Dutch, Africans and some East Europeans among its worshippers. However, in the summer of 2008, the Anglican church moved to a chapel in the neighbouring Theresianenstraat, just outside the Holy Corner, to return in January 2016. At the end of 2015, to offset a big drop in attendance at Roman Catholic churches in Ghent, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ghent had disaffected a number of Roman Catholic church buildings. The Saint Elisabeth church building was then taken over by the Anglican community, which had in the meantime outgrown its location in the Theresianenstraat. The first fully Anglican church service of the \"Saint Elisabeth\u2019s Anglican Church (the Parish of St. John\u2019s)\" took place on Sunday, January 24th 2016 (after an ecumenical one on the 17th).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Holy Corner]] in Edinburgh.\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070516091359/http://www.elisabethbegijnhof.be/english_main.html Saint Elisabeth Group Website]\n*[http://users.skynet.be/gent-stad/S_SE.html the old Saint Elisabeth page (in Dutch) on the website of the Roman Catholic Church in Ghent]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090414111638/http://orthodoxe-kerk-gent.skynetblogs.be/ Orthodox St Andrew Church Website (in Dutch)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070104094917/http://www.vpkb.be/gent-rabot/ Protestant Rabot church website (in Dutch)]\n*[http://www.saintjohnsghent.com Saint Elisabeth\u2019s Anglican Church (the Parish of St. John\u2019s) website]\n\n{{coord|51|03|26|N|3|42|43|E|type:landmark_region:BE_source:nlwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Holy Corner (Ghent Beguinage)}}\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Ghent]]\n[[Category:Beguinages]]\n", "name_user": "Peipsi-Pihkva", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAfter 1874:East Europeans", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Corner_(Begijnhof_Ghent)"}

During prewar and early war field exercises, it was found that the M1 Garand impeded these soldiers' mobility, as a slung rifle would frequently catch on brush, bang the helmet and tilt it over the eyes. Many soldiers found the rifle slid off the shoulder unless slung diagonally across the back, where it prevented the wearing of standard field packs and haversacks.\n\nAdditionally, Germany's use of glider-borne and paratroop forces to launch surprise \u2018blitzkrieg\u2019 attacks behind the front lines generated a request for a new compact infantry weapon to equip support troops.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/><ref name=\"Weeks\">{{cite book|author1=Weeks, John S.|title=World War II Small Arms|url=https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week|url-access=registration|publisher=Chartwell House|isbn=978-0-88365-403-3|date=1 May 1989|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week/page/130 130]|archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> This request called for a compact, lightweight defensive weapon with greater range, accuracy and firepower than handguns, while weighing half as much as the [[Thompson submachine gun]] or the [[M1 rifle]].<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\">{{cite book |author1=George, John|title=Shots Fired In Anger |edition=2nd Revised & Enlarged |location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Rifle Association of America|isbn=978-0935998429 |date=1981|page=394}}</ref> The U.S. Army decided that a carbine would adequately fulfill all of these requirements, but specified that the new arm should weigh no more than five pounds and have an effective range of 300 yards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ozvYaxr6iQ|title=M1 Carbine at 300 Yards|first=|last= |date=2 October 2012|website=YouTube|format=Video}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruth\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L.|title=M1 Carbine: Design, Development & Production|publisher=The Gun Room Press|url=https://www.abebooks.com/M1-CARBINE-DESIGN-DEVELOPMENT-PRODUCTION-Ruth/22379562692/bd |date=1988 |isbn=0-88227-020-6|quote=contains many Ordnance documents related to the \"Light Rifle\" specification that led to the M1 carbine}}</ref> Paratroopers were also added to the list of intended users and a folding-stock version would also be developed.\n\n===Designing the M1 carbine===\nIn 1938, the Chief of Infantry requested that the Ordnance Department develop a \"light rifle\" or carbine, though the formal requirement for the weapon type was not approved until 1940. This led to a competition in 1941 by major U.S. firearm companies and designers.\n\n[[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] at first did not submit a carbine design, as it was occupied in developing the .30-06 Winchester M2 military rifle. The rifle originated as a design by Jonathan \"Ed\" Browning, brother of the famous firearm designer [[John Browning]]. A couple of months after Ed Browning's death in May 1939, Winchester hired [[David Marshall Williams|David Marshall \"Carbine\" Williams]] who had begun work on a [[Gas-operated reloading#Short-stroke piston|short-stroke gas piston]] design while serving a prison sentence at a North Carolina minimum-security work farm. Winchester, after Williams' release, had hired Williams on the strength of recommendations of firearms industry leaders and hoped Williams would be able to complete various designs left unfinished by Ed Browning, including the Winchester .30-06 M2 rifle. Williams incorporated his short-stroke piston in the existing design. After the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] semi-automatic rifle trials in 1940, Browning's rear-locking tilting bolt design proved unreliable in sandy conditions. As a result, the rifle was redesigned to incorporate a Garand-style [[rotating bolt]] and operating rod, retaining Williams' short-stroke piston. By May 1941, Williams had shaved the M2 rifle prototype from about {{convert|9.5|lb|abbr=on}} to a mere {{convert|7.5|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nOrdnance found unsatisfactory the first series of prototype carbines submitted by several firearms companies and some independent designers.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/>  Winchester had contacted the Ordnance Corps to examine their rifle M2 design. Major Ren\u00e9 Studler of Ordnance believed the rifle design could be scaled down to a carbine which would weigh 4.5 to 4.75&nbsp;lb {{nowrap|(2.0\u20132.2 kg)}} and demanded a prototype as soon as possible. The first model was developed at Winchester in 13 days by William C. Roemer, Fred Humeston and three other Winchester engineers under supervision of Edwin Pugsley, and was essentially Williams' last version of the .30-06 M2 scaled down to the .30 SL cartridge.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2016/4/7/carbine-williams-myth-reality/|author1=Canfield, Bruce N.|title='Carbine' Williams: Myth & Reality|magazine=The American Rifleman|publisher=NRA Publications|date=7 April 2016 |format=February 2009 Reprint}}</ref> This patchwork prototype was cobbled together using the trigger housing and lockwork of a Winchester M1905 rifle and a modified Garand operating rod.

Williams participated in the finishing of this prototype. The second prototype competed successfully against all remaining carbine candidates in September 1941, and Winchester was notified of their success the very next month. Standardization as the M1 carbine was approved on October 22, 1941.  This story was the loose basis for the 1952 movie ''[[Carbine Williams]]'' starring [[James Stewart]]. Contrary to the movie, Williams had little to do with the carbine's development, with the exception of his short-stroke gas piston design. Williams worked on his own design apart from the other Winchester staff, but it was not ready for testing until December 1941, two months after the Winchester M1 carbine had been adopted and type-classified. Winchester supervisor Edwin Pugsley conceded that Williams' final design was \"an advance on the one that was accepted\", but noted that Williams' decision to go it alone was a distinct impediment to the project,<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/> and Williams' additional design features were not incorporated into M1 production. In a 1951 memo written in fear of a patent infringement lawsuit by Williams, Winchester noted his patent for the short-stroke piston may have been improperly granted as a previous patent covering the same principle of operation was overlooked by the patent office.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/>\n\nIn 1973 the senior technical editor at the NRA contacted Edwin Pugsley for \"a technical last testament\" on M1 carbine history shortly before his death 19 Nov 1975. According to Pugsley, \"The carbine was invented by no single man,\" but was the result of a team effort including Bill Roemer, Marsh Williams, Fred Humeston, Cliff Warner, at least three other Winchester engineers, and Pugsley himself. Ideas were taken and modified from the Winchester M2 Browning rifle (Williams' gas system), the Winchester 1905 rifle (fire control group), M1 Garand (buttstock dimensions and bolt and operating slide principles), and a percussion shotgun in Pugsley's collection (hook breech and barrel band assembly/disassembly).<ref>E.H.

As a result, the .30 carbine cartridge is approximately 27% more powerful than its parent cartridge. A standard .30 carbine ball bullet weighs 110 grains (7.1&nbsp;g), a complete loaded round weighs 195 grains (12.6&nbsp;g) and has a muzzle velocity of 1,990&nbsp;ft/s (610&nbsp;m/s) giving it 967&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf (1,311 joules) of energy, when fired from the M1 carbine's 18\" barrel.\n\nBy comparison, the [[.30-06]] [[M1 Garand]] is almost 3 times more powerful than the M1 carbine. However, the carbine is twice as powerful as the [[.45ACP]] caliber submachine guns in common use at the time. As a result, the carbine offers much better range, accuracy and penetration than those submachine guns.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/> The M1 is also half the weight of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] and fires a lighter cartridge. Therefore, soldiers armed with the carbine can carry much more ammunition than those armed with a Tommy gun.\n\nCategorizing the M1 carbine series has been the subject of much debate. Although commonly compared to the later German [[Sturmgewehr 44|StG44]] and Russian [[AK-47]], the M1 and M2 carbines are under-powered and outclassed by comparison.<ref name=\"Rottman_Green\"/> The carbine instead falls somewhere between the submachine gun and the assault rifle, and could be called a precursor of the [[personal defense weapon]] since it fulfilled a similar role.\n\nOne characteristic of .30 caliber carbine ammunition is that from the beginning of production, [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|non-corrosive primers]] were specified. This was the first major use of this type of primer in a military firearm.  Because the rifle had a closed gas system, not normally disassembled, corrosive primers would have led to a rapid deterioration of the gas system.<ref name=\"The_AmericanRifleman_to_War\">{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Joseph B. |title=The American rifleman goes to war: The guns, troops, and training of World War II as reported in NRA's magazine |date=1992 |publisher=National Rifle Association of America |page=20 |edition=First |isbn=0935998632 }}</ref>  The use of non-corrosive primers was a novelty in service ammunition at this time.<ref name=\"Dunlap\">{{cite book |author1=Dunlap, Roy F. |title=Ordnance Went Up Front|publisher=R&R Books |date=1993 |pages=240,293\u2013297|edition=1st|url=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30503157727&tab=1&searchurl=sortby%3D17%26tn%3Dordnance%2Bwent%2Bup%2Bfront&cm_sp=snippet-_-srp1-_-seller6}}</ref>  Some failures to fire were reported in early lots of .30 caliber carbine ammunition, attributed to moisture ingress of the non-corrosive primer compound.<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 pp. 191-195\"/>\n\n===Sights, range & accuracy===\nThe M1 carbine entered service with a simple flip sight, which had two settings: 150 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"FM23-7\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/PDFs/FM23-7.PDF|title=BASIC FIELD MANUAL - U.S. CARBINE, CALIBER .30, Ml|date=20 May 1942|publisher=War Department |format=FM 23-7}}</ref> However, field reports indicated that this sight was inadequate, and in 1944, it was replaced by a sliding ramp-type adjustable sight with four settings: 100, 200, 250 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> This new rear sight was also adjustable for windage.\n\nAt {{convert|100|yd}}, the M1 carbine can deliver groups between 3 and 5 inches, sufficient for its intended purpose as a close-range defensive weapon.

This field adaptation was never officially approved, but proved an efficient method to supply extra ammunition in combat.  After the introduction of the 30-round magazine, it was common for troops to tape two 30-round magazines together, a practice that became known as \"[[Jungle style (firearm magazines)|Jungle style]]\". This led the military to introduce the \"Holder, Magazine T3-A1\" also called the \"Jungle Clip\", a metal clamp that held two magazines together without the need for tape.\n\nThe 30-round magazines introduced for use with the selective-fire M2 carbine would not be reliably retained by the magazine catch made for the original M1 carbine which was designed to retain a 15-round magazine, so the much heavier (when loaded) 30-round magazine would not be properly seated in the M1 carbine magazine well. The loaded 30-round magazine would typically cant (impairing feed reliability) or even fall out, which helps explain why the 30-round magazines have a poor reliability record (they are also more prone to damage due to their added length and weight when loaded as thin steel is used to make them). Thus early production M1 carbines must be fitted with the type IV magazine catch used on the M2 carbine (and late production M1 carbines) if they are to be used with 30-round magazines. The type IV magazine catch will have a leg on the left side to correspond with the additional nub on the 30-round magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.thecmp.org/showthread.php?t=5377 |title=Carbine magazine catches |publisher=Civilian Marksmanship Program|date=January 2010 |accessdate=10 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nInitial combat reports noted that M1 carbine's magazine release button was often mistaken for the safety button while under fire.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>  When this occurred, pressing the mag release caused the loaded magazine to drop into the dirt, while the safety remained in the off position.

Due to requests from the field, the carbine was modified to incorporate a bayonet lug attached to the barrel band starting in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rjmilitaria.com/m1carbineb.htm|title= Collecting The M1 carbine|publisher=RJ Militaria|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> However, very few carbines with bayonet lugs reached the front lines before the end of World War II. After the war, the bayonet lug was added to many M1 carbines during the arsenal refurbishing process. By the start of the [[Korean War]], the bayonet lug-equipped M1 was standard issue. It is now rare to find an original M1 carbine without the bayonet lug. The M1 carbine mounts the standard [[M4 bayonet]], which was based on the earlier [[M3 fighting knife]] and formed the basis for the later [[M5 bayonet|M5]], [[M6 bayonet|M6]] and [[M7 bayonet]]-knives.\n\nA folding-stock version of the carbine (the M1A1) was also developed after a request for a compact and light infantry arm for airborne troops. The Inland Division of General Motors manufactured 140,000 of them in two product runs in late 1942.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/> They were originally issued to the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions but were later issued to all U.S. Army airborne units and the  U.S. Marine Corps.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/>  The folding-stock M1A1 is an unusual design in that the stock is not locked in the open or closed position, but is instead held in place by a spring-loaded cam.\n\nAs carbines were reconditioned, parts such as the magazine catch, rear sight, barrel band without bayonet lug, and stock were upgraded with current standard-issue parts. Also, both during and after World War II, many semi-automatic M1 carbines were converted to select-fire M2 carbines by using the T17 and T18 conversion kits.<ref name=\"Firearm_ID\">{{cite book |title=Cartridges and Firearm Identification |author1=Walker, Robert E.|publisher=CRC Press|edition=1st |page= 254|isbn=978-1466502062|date=2012-11-26}}</ref> The conversion included a modified sear, slide, and trigger housing, and added a disconnector, disconnector lever, and selector switch that could be set for semi-auto or full-automatic fire.\n\nDuring World War II, the T23 (M3) [[Flash suppressor|flash hider]] was designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the carbine, but was not introduced into service until the advent of the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L. |title=War Baby: The U.S. Caliber .30 Carbine, Vol. 1|publisher=Collector Grade Publications |isbn=978-0-88935-117-2 |edition=1st Limited|date=1992|pages= 621\u2013623}}</ref>  With the exception of T23 hiders mounted on M3 carbines, few if any T23 flash-hider attachments saw service during the war, though unit armorers occasionally hand-built improvised compensator/flash-hiders of their own design.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\"/><ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\nThe M1 carbine was used with the [[M8 grenade launcher]], which was developed in early 1944. It was fired with the .30 caliber carbine M6 Grenade Blank cartridge to launch [[22 mm grenade|22 mm rifle grenades]]. Stress from firing rifle grenades would eventually crack the carbine's stock. It also could not use the M8 launcher with an M7 auxiliary \"booster\" charge (to extend its range) without breaking the stock. This made it a type of emergency-issue weapon.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Battle of the Bulge.jpg|thumb|American infantrymen of the 290th Regiment fight in fresh snowfall near Amonines, Belgium. Soldier in foreground is armed with an M1 carbine.]]\n\nA total of over 6.1 million M1 carbines of various models was manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II (compared with about 5.4 million M1 rifles and about 1.3 million Thompson submachine guns). Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies (see [[M1_carbine#Military contractors|\u00a7 Military contractors]] below). The largest producer was the Inland division of [[General Motors]], but many others were made by contractors as diverse as [[IBM]], the Underwood Typewriter Company, and [[Rock-Ola|Rock-Ola Manufacturing Corporation]]. Few contractors made all the parts for carbines bearing their names: some makers bought parts from other major contractors or sub-contracted minor parts to companies like Marlin Firearms or Auto-Ordnance. Parts by all makers were required to be interchangeable. Often one company would get ahead or behind in production and parts would be shipped from one company to the other to help them catch up on their quota.  When receivers were shipped for this purpose the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies.  Some of the strangest combinations were the M1's made by the combined efforts of Underwood and Quality Hardware, resulting in the manufacturer mark UN-QUALITY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111230959/http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|url-status=dead|archivedate=11 November 2013|title=UN-QUALITY Stamp|date=11 November 2013|format=Photo}}</ref> The receiver was subcontracted from Union Switch and Signal, not Underwood.

At the beginning of World War II the average production cost for an M1 carbine was approximately $45, about half the cost of an M1 rifle at approximately $85 and about a fifth of the cost of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] at approximately $225. The .30 Caliber carbine ammunition was also far cheaper to produce than the standard .30-06 ammunition; used fewer resources, was smaller, lighter, faster and easier to make. These were major factors in the United States military decision to adopt the M1 carbine, especially when considering the vast numbers of weapons and ammunition manufactured and transported by the United States during World War II.\n\n==U.S. combat use==\n===World War II===\n\n[[File:USMC M1 Carbine.JPEG|thumb|U.S. Marine in combat at Guam.]]\n[[File:First Iwo Jima Flag Raising.jpg|thumb|M1 carbine at first Iwo Jima flag raising.]]\n\nThe M1 carbine with its reduced-power .30 cartridge was not originally intended to serve as a primary weapon for combat infantrymen, nor was it comparable to more powerful assault rifles developed late in the war.

September 20, 1950. The M1 carbine in the foreground has the bayonet mounted.]]\nInitially, the M1 carbine was intended to have a [[selective-fire|select-fire]] capability, but the requirement for rapid production of the new carbine resulted in the omission of this feature from the Light Rifle Program. On 26 October 1944, in response to the Germans' widespread use of automatic weapons, especially the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]], the select-fire '''M2 carbine''' was introduced, along with a new 30-round magazine. The M2 had a fully automatic rate-of-fire of about 850\u2013900 rounds-per-minute. Although actual M2 production began late in the war (April 1945), U.S. Ordnance issued conversion-part kits to allow field conversion of semi-auto M1 carbines to the selective-fire M2 configuration. These converted M1/M2 select-fire carbines saw limited combat service in Europe, primarily during the final Allied advance into Germany. In the Pacific, both converted and original M2 carbines saw limited use in the last days of the fighting in the Philippines.<ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\n====Infrared sight versions====\nThe '''M3 carbine''' was an M2 carbine  with the M2 infrared night sight or ''[[Sniperscope#Generation 0|sniperscope]]''.<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> The M3 did not have [[iron sights]].<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> It was first used in combat by Army units during the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]], about 150 M3 carbines were used on Okinawa. For the first time, U.S. soldiers had a weapon that allowed them to visually detect Japanese infiltrating into American lines at night, even during complete darkness. A team of two or three soldiers was used to operate the weapon and provide support.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  At night, the scope would be used to detect Japanese patrols and assault units moving forward.  At that point, the operator would fire a burst of automatic fire at the greenish images of enemy soldiers.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  The M3 carbine had an effective range of about 70 yards (64 meters), limited by the visual capabilities of the sight.<ref name=\"Article\">{{cite web |title=M3 Infra Red Night Sight |url=http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005050126/http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archivedate=2008-10-05|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Fog and rain further reduced the weapon's effective range.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/><ref name=\"Article\"/> However, it is estimated that fully 30% of Japanese casualties inflicted by rifle and carbine fire during the Okinawan campaign were caused by the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>\n\nThe system was refined over time, and by the Korean War the improved M3 infrared night sight was in service. The M3 sight has a longer effective range than its predecessor, about 125 yards (114 meters). However, it still required the user to carry a heavy backpack-mounted battery pack to power the scope and infrared light. They were used primarily in static defensive positions in Korea to locate troops attempting to infiltrate in darkness. M3 operators would not only use their carbines to dispatch individual targets, but also used tracer ammo to identify troop concentrations for machine gunners to decimate.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> In total, about 20,000 sets were made before they became obsolete, and were surplussed to the public.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Korean War HA-SN-98-07010.jpg|thumb|right| M1 carbine in action during Korean War.

The weapon was taken into use simply because a decision had been taken by Allied authorities to supply .30 caliber weapons from U.S. stocks in the weapons containers dropped to Resistance groups sponsored by an [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]], or later also [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), organizer, on the assumption the groups so supplied would be operating in areas within the operational boundaries of U.S. forces committed to [[Operation Overlord]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} They were found to be suited to the kind of operation the two British, two French, and one Belgian Regiment carried out. It was handy enough to parachute with, and, in addition, could be easily stowed in an operational Jeep. Other specialist intelligence collection units, such as [[30 Assault Unit]] sponsored by the Naval Intelligence Division of the British Admiralty, which operated across the entire Allied area of operations, also made use of this weapon.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The carbine continued to be utilized as late as the [[Malayan Emergency]], by the [[Police Field Force]] of the [[Royal Malaysian Police]], along with other units of the British Army, were issued the M2 carbine for both jungle patrols and outpost defense.<ref name=\"J.W.G.

The \"(a)\" came from the country name in German; in this case, ''Amerika''. It was also used by German police and border guards in [[Bavaria]] after World War II and into the 1950s. The carbines were stamped according to the branch they were in service with; for instance, those used by the border guard were stamped \"''[[Bundesgrenzschutz]]''\". Some of these weapons were modified with different sights, finishes, and sometimes new barrels.\n\n===Japanese GSDF===\nA variant was produced shortly after World War II by the Japanese manufacturer Howa Machinery, under U.S. supervision. These were issued to all branches of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], and large numbers of them found their way to [[Southeast Asia]] during the Vietnam War. Howa also made replacement parts for US-made M1 carbines issued to Japanese police and military.\n\n=== Israel Defense Forces ===\nThe M1 carbine was also used by the Israeli [[Palmach]]-based [[special forces]] in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. And, because of their compact size and semi-auto capabilities, they continued to be used by [[Israeli Defence Forces]] after the creation of Israel. The [[Israeli police]] still use the M1 carbine as a standard long gun for non-combat elements and [[Mash'az]] volunteers.\n\n=== French Army ===\nThe U.S. provided France with 269,644 [[M1 carbines|M1 and M2 carbines]] from World War II to 1963.<ref name=\"bmc\" /> The carbines were used by the French Paratroopers and [[French Foreign Legion|Legionnaires]], as well specialists (drivers, radio operators, engineers), during the [[Indo-China War]],<ref name=\"mcnab2002\">{{cite book |author1=McNab, Chris |editor1-first=Charles C. |editor1-last=Unwin |editor2-first=Mike R. |editor2-last=Vanessa U. |title=20th Century Military Uniforms |date=31 July 2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=Grange Books |location=Kent |isbn=1-84013-476-3|ref=harv|page=84}}</ref> the [[Algerian War]]<ref name =\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement fran\u00e7ais en A.F.N.|trans-title=|pages=12\u201316|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-14-15-texte-integral|first=Jean|last=Huon}}</ref> and the [[Suez Crisis]].\n[[File:Female South Vietnamese Popular Force members on patrol in B\u1ebfn C\u00e1t District.JPEG|thumb|right|South Vietnamese Popular Force members on patrol with M1 carbines.]]\n[[File:Photo taken by Phillip Kemp from cockpit after sling-loading water drums to outpost..jpg|thumb|ROK troops armed with M1 carbines during the Vietnam War.]]\n[[File:CheMuleFull.jpg|thumb|[[Che Guevara]] atop a mule in [[Santa Clara Province|Las Villas province]], [[Cuba]], in November 1958, with an M2 Carbine.]]\n\n=== South Vietnam ===\nThe U.S. provided the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] with 793,994 M1 and M2 carbines from 1963 to 1973.<ref name=\"bmc\" /> Along with tens of thousands of carbines left behind by the French after the [[First Indochina War]], the M1 and M2 carbines were the most widely issued small arm during the early stages in the Vietnam War and remained in service in large numbers until the [[fall of Saigon]].

Over time, the [[SKS]] and eventually the [[AK-47]] would replace the carbine to become the dominant weapons used by the Viet Cong.\n\n=== South Korea ===\nThe [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces]] received 1,015,568 M1 and M2 carbines from 1963 to 1972.<ref name=\"bmc\"/> Along with hundreds of thousands of Carbines and M1 Garands provided by the United States Army before, during and shortly after the [[Korean war]], South Korea would become the largest single recipient of American M1 and M2 carbines.\n\nSouth Korea also took an active role in the Vietnam War. From 1964 to 1973, South Korea sent more than 300,000 troops to South Vietnam armed primarily with M1 and M2 carbines, as well as M1 Garands.\n\n=== Philippines ===\nThe government of the [[Philippines]] still issues M1 carbines to the infantrymen of the Philippine Army's [[2nd Infantry (Jungle Fighter) Division|2nd Infantry Division]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} assigned in Luzon Island  (some units are issued just M14 automatic rifles and M1 carbines) and the Civilian Auxiliary Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) and Civilian Volunteer Organizations (CVO)spread throughout the Philippines. Certain provincial police units of the Philippine National Police (PNP) still use government-issue M1 carbines as well as some operating units of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). In many provinces of the Philippines, M1 carbines are still highly valued as a light small arm. Elements of the New People's Army and Islamic Secessionist movement value the carbine as a lightweight weapon and preferred choice for mountain and ambush operations.\n\nThe M1 carbine has become one of the most recognized firearms in Philippine society, with the Marikina City-based company ARMSCOR Philippines still continuing to manufacture .30 caliber ammunition for the Philippine market.\n\n=== Latin America ===\nThe M1 and M2 carbines were widely used by military, police, and security forces and their opponents during the many guerrilla and civil wars throughout [[Latin America]] until the 1990s, when they were mostly replaced by more modern designs. A notable user was [[Che Guevara]] who used them during the [[Cuban Revolution]] and in [[Bolivia]] where he was executed by a Bolivian soldier armed with an M2 carbine.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Death of Che Guevara: Declassified| publisher=The National Security Archive| url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB5/| accessdate=2016-01-24}}</ref> Guevara's fellow revolutionary [[Camilo Cienfuegos]] also used an M2 carbine that he modified with the pistol grip and foregrip from a [[Thompson submachine gun]].

Inland production of M1A1 carbines was interspersed with Inland production of M1 carbines with the standard stock. Stocks were often swapped out as carbines were refurbished at arsenals. An original Inland carbine with an original M1A1 stock is rare today.\n\n===Carbine, Cal .30, M1A2===\n* Proposed variant with improved sight adjustable for windage and elevation\n* Produced only as 'overstamped' model (an arsenal-refurbished M1 with new rear sight and other late M1 improvements)\n\n===Carbine, Cal .30, M1A3===\n* Underside-folding pantograph [[Stock (firearm)|stock]], 15-round [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]].\n* Type standardized to replace the M1A1 but may not have been issued.\n* Pantograph stock was more rigid than the M1A1's folding stock and folded flush under the fore end.

Fully automatic capability was incorporated into the design of the M2 (an improved, selective-fire version of the M1), introduced in 1944.  The M2 featured the late M1 improvements to the rear sight, addition of a bayonet lug, and other minor changes.\n\nResearch into a conversion kit for selective fire began May 1944; the first kit was developed by Inland engineers, and known as the T4. Inland was awarded a contract for 500 T4 carbines in September 1944. Although the conversion was seen as satisfactory, the heavier 30-round magazine\nput greater strain on the magazine catch, necessitating the development of a sturdier catch. The slide, sear, and stock design also had to be modified. On fully automatic fire, the T4 model could fire about 750 rounds per minute, but generated a manageable recoil.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nAlthough some carbines were marked at the factory as M2, the only significant difference between an M1 and M2 carbine is in the fire control group. The military issued field conversion kits (T17 and T18) to convert an M1 to an M2. Legally a carbine marked M2 is always a machine gun for [[National Firearms Act of 1934|national firearms registry]] purposes.\n\nThese M2 parts including the heavier M2 stock were standardized for arsenal rebuild of M1 and M1A1 carbines.\n\nA modified round bolt replaced the original flat top bolt to save machining steps in manufacture.  Many sources erroneously refer to this round bolt as an 'M2 bolt' but it was developed as a standard part for new manufacture M1 and later M2 carbines and as a replacement part, with priority given to use on M1A1 and M2 carbines.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/> The slightly heavier round bolt did moderate the cyclic rate of the M2 on full automatic.<ref name=\"Small_Arms\">{{cite book |author1=Smith, W.H.B. |title=Small Arms of the World|publisher=Stackpole |date=May 1990|edition=12th|isbn=978-0880296014|quote=illustrates an M2 carbine in an M1A1 stock on p.642 and a parts breakdown of the M2 on p.646 is shown with a flat top bolt}}</ref>\n\nDespite being in demand, very few M2 carbines saw use during World War II, and then mostly in the closing days against Japan.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> The M2 carbine was logistically compatible with the millions of M1 carbines in U.S. service, and offered longer range, better accuracy and better penetration than (pistol caliber) [[submachine gun]]s like the [[M1 Thompson submachine gun|M1 Thompsons]] and [[M3 submachine gun|M3 Grease Guns]].<ref>America's Favorite Gun. by Gold V. Sanders. Popular Science Aug 1944. pp. 84\u201387, 221</ref> Therefore, after World War II, the M2 carbine largely replaced the submachine-guns in U.S. service, until it was itself replaced by the M16 rifle.<ref name=\"The M16 2011. page 6\"/>\n\nThe M2 model was the most widely used Carbine variant during the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> A detailed study of the effectiveness of the M2 in the war was assembled by [[S. L. A. Marshall]]. He found that many troops complained on the lack of effective range of the gun, which allowed the enemy to get close enough to throw [[hand grenade]]s. A more detailed analysis showed however that most troops who complained actually tended to run low on ammo, because they fired their M2 on fully automatic too soon. Troops who fired their guns on semi-automatic at distance generally complained less about the M2's effectiveness. Generally, the more seasoned troops used the latter approach. The carbine was usually given to second line troops (administrative, support, etc.), who had little combat experience and also did not have much training in [[small unit tactics|small-unit tactics]], but who usually had to engage the enemy at some critical moment, like a breakthrough or ambush. Marshall noted that almost all killing shots with carbines in Korea were at ranges of 50 yards or less. It was unsurprising therefore that the M2 was a preferred weapon for [[night combat|night patrols]]. The M2 was also used in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]] by special forces, [[ARVN]] advisers, and air crews.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nContemporary authors have struggled to categorize the M2 carbine. On one hand, it is more powerful than a submachine gun and is considered by some to be an [[assault rifle]], even though it fires a projectile considerably less powerful than the [[StG 44]]'s [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]]. On the other hand, the M2 can also be considered a precursor of the modern [[personal defense weapon]] (PDW) concept, even though contemporary guns in that category, like the [[FN P90]], fire substantially different cartridges like the [[5.7\u00d728mm]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\n===Carbine, Cal. 30, M2A2===\n* Arsenal-refurbished (overstamped M2) model\n\n===Carbine, Cal .30, M3===\n* M2 with mounting (T3 mount) for an early active (infrared) night vision sight\n* About 3,000 produced\n* Three versions of night sight (M1, M2, M3)\n\n[[File:M3 Sniperscope.jpg|thumb|right|Original Korean War era USMC M3 Night Vision Scope]]\n\nThe M3 carbine was an M2 carbine fitted with a mount designed to accept an infrared sight for use at night.  It was initially used with the M1 [[Image intensifier#Generation 0|sniperscope]], and an active [[infrared]] sight, and saw action in 1945 with the Army during the invasion of Okinawa.  Before the M3 carbine and M1 sniperscope were type-classified, they were known as the T3 and T120, respectively. The system continued to be developed, and by the time of the [[Korean War]], the M3 carbine was used with the M3 sniperscope.\n\nThe M2 sniper scope extended the effective nighttime range of the M3 carbine to 100 yards.  In the later stages of the Korean War, an improved version of the M3 carbine, with a revised mount, a forward pistol grip, and a new M3 sniperscope design was used in the latter stages of Korea and briefly in Vietnam.  The M3 sniperscope had a large active infrared spotlight mounted on top of the scope body itself, allowing use in the prone position. The revised M3/M3 had an effective range of around 125 yards.<ref name=\"Article\"/> Eventually, the M3 carbine and its M3 sniperscope would be superseded by passive-design night vision scopes with extended visible ranges; the improved scopes in turn required the use of rifle-caliber weapons with flatter trajectories and increased hit probability.\n\n==Derivatives==\n===Ingram SAM===\n\nThe [[Military Armament Corporation|Ingram]] SAM rifles are M1 carbine derivatives in [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] (SAM-1), [[7.62\u00d739mm]] (SAM-2) and [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] (SAM-3). The 5.56\u00d745mm versions accept M16 magazines, the 7.62\u00d739mm accept AK magazines and the 7.62\u00d751mm versions use FN FAL magazines. They did not catch on in competition against the Ruger Mini-14 in both the police and civilian markets. The Ingram SAM rifles are occasionally found on auction sites for collectors.\n\n=== 9\u00d719mm Parabellum ===\nIver Johnson's 9\u00d719mm Parabellum Carbine was introduced in 1985 until 1986 using modified Browning High Power 20 round magazines.\nThe Chiappa M1-9 is a M1 carbine derivative made by [[Chiappa Firearms]] chambered in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum which uses [[Beretta 92|Beretta M9/92FS]] magazines.\n\n==Military contractors==\n* Inland Division, [[General Motors]] (production: 2,632,097), sole producer of the M1A1 Carbine.

Inland Manufacturing, LLC is a private entity that is producing reproductions of the M1 Carbine and M1A1 Paratrooper models that were built by the original Inland Division of General Motors from 1941 to 1945.  The new Inland M1 carbines feature many of the same characteristics of the original Inland Carbines and are manufactured in the USA.  The M1 carbine is modeled after the last production model that Inland manufactured in 1945 and features a type 3 bayonet lug / barrel band, adjustable rear sights, push button safety, round bolt, and \"low wood\" walnut stock, and a 15-round magazine.  A 30-round mag catch was utilized to allow high-capacity magazines. A \"1944\" M1 Carbine is also available that has the same features as the 1945 only with a Type 2 barrel Band and 10-round magazine and is available for sale in most states with magazine capacity & bayonet lug restrictions.

It is still popular with civilian shooters around the world and is prized as a historically significant collector's item. The Carbine continues to be used in military marksmanship training and competitive target matches conducted by rifle clubs affiliated with the [[Civilian Marksmanship Program]] (CMP).\n\nThe M1 carbine can be used for big-game hunting, such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[mule deer]] at close range (less than 100 yards), but is definitely underpowered for larger North American game such as [[elk]], [[moose]], and [[bear]].

The M1 Carbine is also prohibited for hunting in several states such as [[Pennsylvania]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pgc.pa.gov/HuntTrap/Law/Pages/HuntingandTrappingDigest.aspx|title=Hunting & Trapping Digest|website=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania}}</ref> because of the semi-automatic function, and [[Illinois]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dnr.state.il.us/admin/systems/Digest/Digest.pdf |title=Illinois: Digest of Hunting and Trapping Regulations 2007\u20132008, Statewide Deer Hunting Information|publisher=Illinois Department of Natural Resources|page=11\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227160129/http://dnr.state.il.us/admin/systems/Digest/Digest.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> which prohibits all non-muzzleloading rifles for big game hunting. Five-round magazines are commercially made for use in states that limit the capacity of semi-automatic hunting rifles.\n\nSome indoor pistol ranges may permit the firing of an M1 carbine, as its bullet is comparable to magnum handgun rounds, whereas an AR-15, AK-47 or other high-velocity rifle might penetrate the backstop.\n\nNew Jersey lists the \"M1 Carbine Type\" as a banned assault firearm although most examples of the M1 Carbine technically meet the restrictions on semi-automatic rifles identified by the state. Although not banned by name, make or model, M1 Carbines may in some cases be classified as contraband assault weapon under the 2013 NY SAFE act if they feature bayonet lugs, pistol grips, folding stocks and flash suppressors. 10-round magazines are available in states that restrict magazine capacity for civilian firearms.\n\nThe M1 carbine was also used by various law enforcement agencies and prison guards, and was prominently carried by riot police during the civil unrest of the late 1960s and early 1970s; until it was replaced in those roles by more modern .223 caliber semi-automatic rifles such as the [[Ruger Mini-14]] and the [[Colt AR-15]] type rifles in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe ease of use and great adaptability of the weapon led to it being used by [[Malcolm X]] and [[Patty Hearst]]. Both were featured in famous news photographs carrying the carbine.  An M1 was also the weapon used in the 1947 assassination of notorious American mobster [[Bugsy Siegel | Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel]].\n\n==Related equipment and accessories==\n===Ammunition types===\n{{Main|.30 Carbine}}\nThe ammunition used by the military with the carbine include:<ref>''TM 9-1305-200/TO 11A13-1-101 Small-Arms Ammunition'', 1961, pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Ball, M1\n* Cartridge, Grenade, Caliber .30, M6 (also authorized for other blank firing uses, due to a lack of a dedicated blank cartridge)\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Dummy, M13\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Ball, Test, High Pressure, M18\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Tracer, M16 (also rated as having an incendiary effect)\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Tracer, M27 (dimmer illumination and no incendiary effect)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of U.S. Army weapons by supply catalog designation]] SNL B-28\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Barnes, Frank C., ''Cartridges of the World'', Iola, WI: DBI Books Inc., {{ISBN|0-87349-033-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87349-033-7}}, (6th ed., 1989).\n* {{cite magazine|author=Canfield, Bruce N. |title=A New Lease on Life: The Post-World War II M1 Carbine |magazine=American Rifleman |date=June 2007}}\n* Dunlap, Roy F.

During prewar and early war field exercises, it was found that the M1 Garand impeded these soldiers' mobility, as a slung rifle would frequently catch on brush, bang the helmet and tilt it over the eyes. Many soldiers found the rifle slid off the shoulder unless slung diagonally across the back, where it prevented the wearing of standard field packs and haversacks.\n\nAdditionally, Germany's use of glider-borne and paratroop forces to launch surprise \u2018blitzkrieg\u2019 attacks behind the front lines generated a request for a new compact infantry weapon to equip support troops.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/><ref name=\"Weeks\">{{cite book|author1=Weeks, John S.|title=World War II Small Arms|url=https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week|url-access=registration|publisher=Chartwell House|isbn=978-0-88365-403-3|date=1 May 1989|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week/page/130 130]|archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> This request called for a compact, lightweight defensive weapon with greater range, accuracy and firepower than handguns, while weighing half as much as the [[Thompson submachine gun]] or the [[M1 rifle]].<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\">{{cite book |author1=George, John|title=Shots Fired In Anger |edition=2nd Revised & Enlarged |location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Rifle Association of America|isbn=978-0935998429 |date=1981|page=394}}</ref> The U.S. Army decided that a carbine would adequately fulfill all of these requirements, but specified that the new arm should weigh no more than five pounds and have an effective range of 300 yards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ozvYaxr6iQ|title=M1 Carbine at 300 Yards|first=|last= |date=2 October 2012|website=YouTube|format=Video}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruth\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L.|title=M1 Carbine: Design, Development & Production|publisher=The Gun Room Press|url=https://www.abebooks.com/M1-CARBINE-DESIGN-DEVELOPMENT-PRODUCTION-Ruth/22379562692/bd |date=1988 |isbn=0-88227-020-6|quote=contains many Ordnance documents related to the \"Light Rifle\" specification that led to the M1 carbine}}</ref> Paratroopers were also added to the list of intended users and a folding-stock version would also be developed.\n\n===Designing the M1 carbine===\nIn 1938, the Chief of Infantry requested that the Ordnance Department develop a \"light rifle\" or carbine, though the formal requirement for the weapon type was not approved until 1940. This led to a competition in 1941 by major U.S. firearm companies and designers.\n\n[[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] at first did not submit a carbine design, as it was occupied in developing the .30-06 Winchester M2 military rifle. The rifle originated as a design by Jonathan \"Ed\" Browning, brother of the famous firearm designer [[John Browning]]. A couple of months after Ed Browning's death in May 1939, Winchester hired [[David Marshall Williams|David Marshall \"Carbine\" Williams]] who had begun work on a [[Gas-operated reloading#Short-stroke piston|short-stroke gas piston]] design while serving a prison sentence at a North Carolina minimum-security work farm. Winchester, after Williams' release, had hired Williams on the strength of recommendations of firearms industry leaders and hoped Williams would be able to complete various designs left unfinished by Ed Browning, including the Winchester .30-06 M2 rifle. Williams incorporated his short-stroke piston in the existing design. After the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] semi-automatic rifle trials in 1940, Browning's rear-locking tilting bolt design proved unreliable in sandy conditions. As a result, the rifle was redesigned to incorporate a Garand-style [[rotating bolt]] and operating rod, retaining Williams' short-stroke piston. By May 1941, Williams had shaved the M2 rifle prototype from about {{convert|9.5|lb|abbr=on}} to a mere {{convert|7.5|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nOrdnance found unsatisfactory the first series of prototype carbines submitted by several firearms companies and some independent designers.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/>  Winchester had contacted the Ordnance Corps to examine their rifle M2 design. Major Ren\u00e9 Studler of Ordnance believed the rifle design could be scaled down to a carbine which would weigh 4.5 to 4.75&nbsp;lb {{nowrap|(2.0\u20132.2 kg)}} and demanded a prototype as soon as possible. The first model was developed at Winchester in 13 days by William C. Roemer, Fred Humeston and three other Winchester engineers under supervision of Edwin Pugsley, and was essentially Williams' last version of the .30-06 M2 scaled down to the .30 SL cartridge.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2016/4/7/carbine-williams-myth-reality/|author1=Canfield, Bruce N.|title='Carbine' Williams: Myth & Reality|magazine=The American Rifleman|publisher=NRA Publications|date=7 April 2016 |format=February 2009 Reprint}}</ref> This patchwork prototype was cobbled together using the trigger housing and lockwork of a Winchester M1905 rifle and a modified Garand operating rod.

Williams participated in the finishing of this prototype. The second prototype competed successfully against all remaining carbine candidates in September 1941, and Winchester was notified of their success the very next month. Standardization as the M1 carbine was approved on October 22, 1941.  This story was the loose basis for the 1952 movie ''[[Carbine Williams]]'' starring [[James Stewart]]. Contrary to the movie, Williams had little to do with the carbine's development, with the exception of his short-stroke gas piston design. Williams worked on his own design apart from the other Winchester staff, but it was not ready for testing until December 1941, two months after the Winchester M1 carbine had been adopted and type-classified. Winchester supervisor Edwin Pugsley conceded that Williams' final design was \"an advance on the one that was accepted\", but noted that Williams' decision to go it alone was a distinct impediment to the project,<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/> and Williams' additional design features were not incorporated into M1 production. In a 1951 memo written in fear of a patent infringement lawsuit by Williams, Winchester noted his patent for the short-stroke piston may have been improperly granted as a previous patent covering the same principle of operation was overlooked by the patent office.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/>\n\nIn 1973 the senior technical editor at the NRA contacted Edwin Pugsley for \"a technical last testament\" on M1 carbine history shortly before his death 19 Nov 1975. According to Pugsley, \"The carbine was invented by no single man,\" but was the result of a team effort including Bill Roemer, Marsh Williams, Fred Humeston, Cliff Warner, at least three other Winchester engineers, and Pugsley himself. Ideas were taken and modified from the Winchester M2 Browning rifle (Williams' gas system), the Winchester 1905 rifle (fire control group), M1 Garand (buttstock dimensions and bolt and operating slide principles), and a percussion shotgun in Pugsley's collection (hook breech and barrel band assembly/disassembly).<ref>E.H.

As a result, the .30 carbine cartridge is approximately 27% more powerful than its parent cartridge. A standard .30 carbine ball bullet weighs 110 grains (7.1&nbsp;g), a complete loaded round weighs 195 grains (12.6&nbsp;g) and has a muzzle velocity of 1,990&nbsp;ft/s (610&nbsp;m/s) giving it 967&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf (1,311 joules) of energy, when fired from the M1 carbine's 18\" barrel.\n\nBy comparison, the [[.30-06]] [[M1 Garand]] is almost 3 times more powerful than the M1 carbine. However, the carbine is twice as powerful as the [[.45ACP]] caliber submachine guns in common use at the time. As a result, the carbine offers much better range, accuracy and penetration than those submachine guns.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/> The M1 is also half the weight of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] and fires a lighter cartridge. Therefore, soldiers armed with the carbine can carry much more ammunition than those armed with a Tommy gun.\n\nCategorizing the M1 carbine series has been the subject of much debate. Although commonly compared to the later German [[Sturmgewehr 44|StG44]] and Russian [[AK-47]], the M1 and M2 carbines are under-powered and outclassed by comparison.<ref name=\"Rottman_Green\"/> The carbine instead falls somewhere between the submachine gun and the assault rifle, and could be called a precursor of the [[personal defense weapon]] since it fulfilled a similar role.\n\nOne characteristic of .30 caliber carbine ammunition is that from the beginning of production, [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|non-corrosive primers]] were specified. This was the first major use of this type of primer in a military firearm.  Because the rifle had a closed gas system, not normally disassembled, corrosive primers would have led to a rapid deterioration of the gas system.<ref name=\"The_AmericanRifleman_to_War\">{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Joseph B. |title=The American rifleman goes to war: The guns, troops, and training of World War II as reported in NRA's magazine |date=1992 |publisher=National Rifle Association of America |page=20 |edition=First |isbn=0935998632 }}</ref>  The use of non-corrosive primers was a novelty in service ammunition at this time.<ref name=\"Dunlap\">{{cite book |author1=Dunlap, Roy F. |title=Ordnance Went Up Front|publisher=R&R Books |date=1993 |pages=240,293\u2013297|edition=1st|url=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30503157727&tab=1&searchurl=sortby%3D17%26tn%3Dordnance%2Bwent%2Bup%2Bfront&cm_sp=snippet-_-srp1-_-seller6}}</ref>  Some failures to fire were reported in early lots of .30 caliber carbine ammunition, attributed to moisture ingress of the non-corrosive primer compound.<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 pp. 191-195\"/>\n\n===Sights, range & accuracy===\nThe M1 carbine entered service with a simple flip sight, which had two settings: 150 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"FM23-7\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/PDFs/FM23-7.PDF|title=BASIC FIELD MANUAL - U.S. CARBINE, CALIBER .30, Ml|date=20 May 1942|publisher=War Department |format=FM 23-7}}</ref> However, field reports indicated that this sight was inadequate, and in 1944, it was replaced by a sliding ramp-type adjustable sight with four settings: 100, 200, 250 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> This new rear sight was also adjustable for windage.\n\nAt {{convert|100|yd}}, the M1 carbine can deliver groups between 3 and 5 inches, sufficient for its intended purpose as a close-range defensive weapon.

This field adaptation was never officially approved, but proved an efficient method to supply extra ammunition in combat.  After the introduction of the 30-round magazine, it was common for troops to tape two 30-round magazines together, a practice that became known as \"[[Jungle style (firearm magazines)|Jungle style]]\". This led the military to introduce the \"Holder, Magazine T3-A1\" also called the \"Jungle Clip\", a metal clamp that held two magazines together without the need for tape.\n\nThe 30-round magazines introduced for use with the selective-fire M2 carbine would not be reliably retained by the magazine catch made for the original M1 carbine which was designed to retain a 15-round magazine, so the much heavier (when loaded) 30-round magazine would not be properly seated in the M1 carbine magazine well. The loaded 30-round magazine would typically cant (impairing feed reliability) or even fall out, which helps explain why the 30-round magazines have a poor reliability record (they are also more prone to damage due to their added length and weight when loaded as thin steel is used to make them). Thus early production M1 carbines must be fitted with the type IV magazine catch used on the M2 carbine (and late production M1 carbines) if they are to be used with 30-round magazines. The type IV magazine catch will have a leg on the left side to correspond with the additional nub on the 30-round magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.thecmp.org/showthread.php?t=5377 |title=Carbine magazine catches |publisher=Civilian Marksmanship Program|date=January 2010 |accessdate=10 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nInitial combat reports noted that M1 carbine's magazine release button was often mistaken for the safety button while under fire.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>  When this occurred, pressing the mag release caused the loaded magazine to drop into the dirt, while the safety remained in the off position. As a result, the push-button safety was redesigned using a rotating lever.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/><ref name=\"M1_Warrior\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gunsandammo.com/blogs/history-books/m1-carbine-americas-unlikely-warrior/|magazine=Guns & Ammo|title=M1 Carbine: America's Unlikely Warrior|author1=James, Garry|date=6 October 2014|quote=The M1 carbine (M1A1 shown) was one of America's most widely used arms in three major conflicts and a popular lend/lease item to Allied countries.}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nOriginally the M1 carbine did not have a bayonet lug, but it was often issued with an [[M3 fighting knife]] or a bayonet converted into a fighting knife. Due to requests from the field, the carbine was modified to incorporate a bayonet lug attached to the barrel band starting in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rjmilitaria.com/m1carbineb.htm|title= Collecting The M1 carbine|publisher=RJ Militaria|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> However, very few carbines with bayonet lugs reached the front lines before the end of World War II. After the war, the bayonet lug was added to many M1 carbines during the arsenal refurbishing process. By the start of the [[Korean War]], the bayonet lug-equipped M1 was standard issue. It is now rare to find an original M1 carbine without the bayonet lug. The M1 carbine mounts the standard [[M4 bayonet]], which was based on the earlier [[M3 fighting knife]] and formed the basis for the later [[M5 bayonet|M5]], [[M6 bayonet|M6]] and [[M7 bayonet]]-knives.\n\nA folding-stock version of the carbine (the M1A1) was also developed after a request for a compact and light infantry arm for airborne troops. The Inland Division of General Motors manufactured 140,000 of them in two product runs in late 1942.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/> They were originally issued to the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions but were later issued to all U.S. Army airborne units and the  U.S. Marine Corps.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/>  The folding-stock M1A1 is an unusual design in that the stock is not locked in the open or closed position, but is instead held in place by a spring-loaded cam.\n\nAs carbines were reconditioned, parts such as the magazine catch, rear sight, barrel band without bayonet lug, and stock were upgraded with current standard-issue parts. Also, both during and after World War II, many semi-automatic M1 carbines were converted to select-fire M2 carbines by using the T17 and T18 conversion kits.<ref name=\"Firearm_ID\">{{cite book |title=Cartridges and Firearm Identification |author1=Walker, Robert E.|publisher=CRC Press|edition=1st |page= 254|isbn=978-1466502062|date=2012-11-26}}</ref> The conversion included a modified sear, slide, and trigger housing, and added a disconnector, disconnector lever, and selector switch that could be set for semi-auto or full-automatic fire.\n\nDuring World War II, the T23 (M3) [[Flash suppressor|flash hider]] was designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the carbine, but was not introduced into service until the advent of the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L. |title=War Baby: The U.S. Caliber .30 Carbine, Vol. 1|publisher=Collector Grade Publications |isbn=978-0-88935-117-2 |edition=1st Limited|date=1992|pages= 621\u2013623}}</ref>  With the exception of T23 hiders mounted on M3 carbines, few if any T23 flash-hider attachments saw service during the war, though unit armorers occasionally hand-built improvised compensator/flash-hiders of their own design.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\"/><ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\nThe M1 carbine was used with the [[M8 grenade launcher]], which was developed in early 1944. It was fired with the .30 caliber carbine M6 Grenade Blank cartridge to launch [[22 mm grenade|22 mm rifle grenades]]. Stress from firing rifle grenades would eventually crack the carbine's stock. It also could not use the M8 launcher with an M7 auxiliary \"booster\" charge (to extend its range) without breaking the stock. This made it a type of emergency-issue weapon.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Battle of the Bulge.jpg|thumb|American infantrymen of the 290th Regiment fight in fresh snowfall near Amonines, Belgium. Soldier in foreground is armed with an M1 carbine.]]\n\nA total of over 6.1 million M1 carbines of various models was manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II (compared with about 5.4 million M1 rifles and about 1.3 million Thompson submachine guns). Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies (see [[M1_carbine#Military contractors|\u00a7 Military contractors]] below). The largest producer was the Inland division of [[General Motors]], but many others were made by contractors as diverse as [[IBM]], the Underwood Typewriter Company, and [[Rock-Ola|Rock-Ola Manufacturing Corporation]]. Few contractors made all the parts for carbines bearing their names: some makers bought parts from other major contractors or sub-contracted minor parts to companies like Marlin Firearms or Auto-Ordnance. Parts by all makers were required to be interchangeable. Often one company would get ahead or behind in production and parts would be shipped from one company to the other to help them catch up on their quota.  When receivers were shipped for this purpose the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies.  Some of the strangest combinations were the M1's made by the combined efforts of Underwood and Quality Hardware, resulting in the manufacturer mark UN-QUALITY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111230959/http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|url-status=dead|archivedate=11 November 2013|title=UN-QUALITY Stamp|date=11 November 2013|format=Photo}}</ref> The receiver was subcontracted from Union Switch and Signal, not Underwood.

At the beginning of World War II the average production cost for an M1 carbine was approximately $45, about half the cost of an M1 rifle at approximately $85 and about a fifth of the cost of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] at approximately $225. The .30 Caliber carbine ammunition was also far cheaper to produce than the standard .30-06 ammunition; used fewer resources, was smaller, lighter, faster and easier to make. These were major factors in the United States military decision to adopt the M1 carbine, especially when considering the vast numbers of weapons and ammunition manufactured and transported by the United States during World War II.\n\n==U.S. combat use==\n===World War II===\n\n[[File:USMC M1 Carbine.JPEG|thumb|U.S. Marine in combat at Guam.]]\n[[File:First Iwo Jima Flag Raising.jpg|thumb|M1 carbine at first Iwo Jima flag raising.]]\n\nThe M1 carbine with its reduced-power .30 cartridge was not originally intended to serve as a primary weapon for combat infantrymen, nor was it comparable to more powerful assault rifles developed late in the war.

September 20, 1950. The M1 carbine in the foreground has the bayonet mounted.]]\nInitially, the M1 carbine was intended to have a [[selective-fire|select-fire]] capability, but the requirement for rapid production of the new carbine resulted in the omission of this feature from the Light Rifle Program. On 26 October 1944, in response to the Germans' widespread use of automatic weapons, especially the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]], the select-fire '''M2 carbine''' was introduced, along with a new 30-round magazine. The M2 had a fully automatic rate-of-fire of about 850\u2013900 rounds-per-minute. Although actual M2 production began late in the war (April 1945), U.S. Ordnance issued conversion-part kits to allow field conversion of semi-auto M1 carbines to the selective-fire M2 configuration. These converted M1/M2 select-fire carbines saw limited combat service in Europe, primarily during the final Allied advance into Germany. In the Pacific, both converted and original M2 carbines saw limited use in the last days of the fighting in the Philippines.<ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\n====Infrared sight versions====\nThe '''M3 carbine''' was an M2 carbine  with the M2 infrared night sight or ''[[Sniperscope#Generation 0|sniperscope]]''.<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> The M3 did not have [[iron sights]].<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> It was first used in combat by Army units during the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]], about 150 M3 carbines were used on Okinawa. For the first time, U.S. soldiers had a weapon that allowed them to visually detect Japanese infiltrating into American lines at night, even during complete darkness. A team of two or three soldiers was used to operate the weapon and provide support.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  At night, the scope would be used to detect Japanese patrols and assault units moving forward.  At that point, the operator would fire a burst of automatic fire at the greenish images of enemy soldiers.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  The M3 carbine had an effective range of about 70 yards (64 meters), limited by the visual capabilities of the sight.<ref name=\"Article\">{{cite web |title=M3 Infra Red Night Sight |url=http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005050126/http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archivedate=2008-10-05|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Fog and rain further reduced the weapon's effective range.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/><ref name=\"Article\"/> However, it is estimated that fully 30% of Japanese casualties inflicted by rifle and carbine fire during the Okinawan campaign were caused by the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>\n\nThe system was refined over time, and by the Korean War the improved M3 infrared night sight was in service. The M3 sight has a longer effective range than its predecessor, about 125 yards (114 meters). However, it still required the user to carry a heavy backpack-mounted battery pack to power the scope and infrared light. They were used primarily in static defensive positions in Korea to locate troops attempting to infiltrate in darkness. M3 operators would not only use their carbines to dispatch individual targets, but also used tracer ammo to identify troop concentrations for machine gunners to decimate.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> In total, about 20,000 sets were made before they became obsolete, and were surplussed to the public.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Korean War HA-SN-98-07010.jpg|thumb|right| M1 carbine in action during Korean War.

Inland production of M1A1 carbines was interspersed with Inland production of M1 carbines with the standard stock. Stocks were often swapped out as carbines were refurbished at arsenals. An original Inland carbine with an original M1A1 stock is rare today.\n\n===Carbine, Cal .30, M1A2===\n* Proposed variant with improved sight adjustable for windage and elevation\n* Produced only as 'overstamped' model (an arsenal-refurbished M1 with new rear sight and other late M1 improvements)\n\n===Carbine, Cal .30, M1A3===\n* Underside-folding pantograph [[Stock (firearm)|stock]], 15-round [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]].\n* Type standardized to replace the M1A1 but may not have been issued.\n* Pantograph stock was more rigid than the M1A1's folding stock and folded flush under the fore end.

Fully automatic capability was incorporated into the design of the M2 (an improved, selective-fire version of the M1), introduced in 1944.  The M2 featured the late M1 improvements to the rear sight, addition of a bayonet lug, and other minor changes.\n\nResearch into a conversion kit for selective fire began May 1944; the first kit was developed by Inland engineers, and known as the T4. Inland was awarded a contract for 500 T4 carbines in September 1944. Although the conversion was seen as satisfactory, the heavier 30-round magazine\nput greater strain on the magazine catch, necessitating the development of a sturdier catch. The slide, sear, and stock design also had to be modified. On fully automatic fire, the T4 model could fire about 750 rounds per minute, but generated a manageable recoil.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nAlthough some carbines were marked at the factory as M2, the only significant difference between an M1 and M2 carbine is in the fire control group. The military issued field conversion kits (T17 and T18) to convert an M1 to an M2. Legally a carbine marked M2 is always a machine gun for [[National Firearms Act of 1934|national firearms registry]] purposes.\n\nThese M2 parts including the heavier M2 stock were standardized for arsenal rebuild of M1 and M1A1 carbines.\n\nA modified round bolt replaced the original flat top bolt to save machining steps in manufacture.  Many sources erroneously refer to this round bolt as an 'M2 bolt' but it was developed as a standard part for new manufacture M1 and later M2 carbines and as a replacement part, with priority given to use on M1A1 and M2 carbines.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/> The slightly heavier round bolt did moderate the cyclic rate of the M2 on full automatic.<ref name=\"Small_Arms\">{{cite book |author1=Smith, W.H.B. |title=Small Arms of the World|publisher=Stackpole |date=May 1990|edition=12th|isbn=978-0880296014|quote=illustrates an M2 carbine in an M1A1 stock on p.642 and a parts breakdown of the M2 on p.646 is shown with a flat top bolt}}</ref>\n\nDespite being in demand, very few M2 carbines saw use during World War II, and then mostly in the closing days against Japan.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> The M2 carbine was logistically compatible with the millions of M1 carbines in U.S. service, and offered longer range, better accuracy and better penetration than (pistol caliber) [[submachine gun]]s like the [[M1 Thompson submachine gun|M1 Thompsons]] and [[M3 submachine gun|M3 Grease Guns]].<ref>America's Favorite Gun. by Gold V. Sanders. Popular Science Aug 1944. pp. 84\u201387, 221</ref> Therefore, after World War II, the M2 carbine largely replaced the submachine-guns in U.S. service, until it was itself replaced by the M16 rifle.<ref name=\"The M16 2011. page 6\"/>\n\nThe M2 model was the most widely used Carbine variant during the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> A detailed study of the effectiveness of the M2 in the war was assembled by [[S. L. A. Marshall]]. He found that many troops complained on the lack of effective range of the gun, which allowed the enemy to get close enough to throw [[hand grenade]]s. A more detailed analysis showed however that most troops who complained actually tended to run low on ammo, because they fired their M2 on fully automatic too soon. Troops who fired their guns on semi-automatic at distance generally complained less about the M2's effectiveness. Generally, the more seasoned troops used the latter approach. The carbine was usually given to second line troops (administrative, support, etc.), who had little combat experience and also did not have much training in [[small unit tactics|small-unit tactics]], but who usually had to engage the enemy at some critical moment, like a breakthrough or ambush. Marshall noted that almost all killing shots with carbines in Korea were at ranges of 50 yards or less. It was unsurprising therefore that the M2 was a preferred weapon for [[night combat|night patrols]]. The M2 was also used in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]] by special forces, [[ARVN]] advisers, and air crews.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nContemporary authors have struggled to categorize the M2 carbine. On one hand, it is more powerful than a submachine gun and is considered by some to be an [[assault rifle]], even though it fires a projectile considerably less powerful than the [[StG 44]]'s [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]]. On the other hand, the M2 can also be considered a precursor of the modern [[personal defense weapon]] (PDW) concept, even though contemporary guns in that category, like the [[FN P90]], fire substantially different cartridges like the [[5.7\u00d728mm]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\n===Carbine, Cal. 30, M2A2===\n* Arsenal-refurbished (overstamped M2) model\n\n===Carbine, Cal .30, M3===\n* M2 with mounting (T3 mount) for an early active (infrared) night vision sight\n* About 3,000 produced\n* Three versions of night sight (M1, M2, M3)\n\n[[File:M3 Sniperscope.jpg|thumb|right|Original Korean War era USMC M3 Night Vision Scope]]\n\nThe M3 carbine was an M2 carbine fitted with a mount designed to accept an infrared sight for use at night.  It was initially used with the M1 [[Image intensifier#Generation 0|sniperscope]], and an active [[infrared]] sight, and saw action in 1945 with the Army during the invasion of Okinawa.  Before the M3 carbine and M1 sniperscope were type-classified, they were known as the T3 and T120, respectively. The system continued to be developed, and by the time of the [[Korean War]], the M3 carbine was used with the M3 sniperscope.\n\nThe M2 sniper scope extended the effective nighttime range of the M3 carbine to 100 yards.  In the later stages of the Korean War, an improved version of the M3 carbine, with a revised mount, a forward pistol grip, and a new M3 sniperscope design was used in the latter stages of Korea and briefly in Vietnam.  The M3 sniperscope had a large active infrared spotlight mounted on top of the scope body itself, allowing use in the prone position. The revised M3/M3 had an effective range of around 125 yards.<ref name=\"Article\"/> Eventually, the M3 carbine and its M3 sniperscope would be superseded by passive-design night vision scopes with extended visible ranges; the improved scopes in turn required the use of rifle-caliber weapons with flatter trajectories and increased hit probability.\n\n==Derivatives==\n===Ingram SAM===\n\nThe [[Military Armament Corporation|Ingram]] SAM rifles are M1 carbine derivatives in [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] (SAM-1), [[7.62\u00d739mm]] (SAM-2) and [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] (SAM-3). The 5.56\u00d745mm versions accept M16 magazines, the 7.62\u00d739mm accept AK magazines and the 7.62\u00d751mm versions use FN FAL magazines. They did not catch on in competition against the Ruger Mini-14 in both the police and civilian markets. The Ingram SAM rifles are occasionally found on auction sites for collectors.\n\n=== 9\u00d719mm Parabellum ===\nIver Johnson's 9\u00d719mm Parabellum Carbine was introduced in 1985 until 1986 using modified Browning High Power 20 round magazines.\nThe Chiappa M1-9 is a M1 carbine derivative made by [[Chiappa Firearms]] chambered in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum which uses [[Beretta 92|Beretta M9/92FS]] magazines.\n\n==Military contractors==\n* Inland Division, [[General Motors]] (production: 2,632,097), sole producer of the M1A1 Carbine.

Johnson]] introduced a version of the M1 carbine called the \"Spitfire\" that fired a 5.7&nbsp;mm (.22&nbsp;in) [[wildcat cartridge]] known as the 5.7&nbsp;mm MMJ or [[.22 Spitfire]].<ref name=\"BAR\"/>  The Spitfire fired a 40-grain (2.6&nbsp;g) bullet with a muzzle velocity of 2850&nbsp;ft/s (870&nbsp;m/s) for a muzzle energy of {{convert|720|ftlbf|J}}.<ref name=\"BAR\">{{cite book|url=https://www.abebooks.com/9780873491785/Cartridges-World-Complete-Illustrated-Reference-0873491785/plp |author1=Barnes, Frank C. |title=Cartridges of the World| location=Iola, WI |publisher=DBI Books Inc. |isbn=978-0-87349-033-7 |edition=6th |date=1997 |pages=52,127}}</ref>  Johnson advertised the smaller caliber and the modified carbine as a survival rifle for use in jungles or other remote areas.  While the concept had some military application when used for this role in the selective-fire M2 carbine, it was not pursued, and few Spitfire carbines were made.<ref name=\"BAR\"/>\n\n[[File:M1 carbine kahr.jpg|thumb|left|An Auto-Ordnance AOM-130 Carbine manufactured in 2007.]]\n\nMore recently, the Auto-Ordnance division of Kahr Arms began production of an M1 carbine replica in 2005 based on the typical M1 carbine as issued in 1944, without the later adjustable sight or barrel band with bayonet lug. The original Auto-Ordnance had produced various parts for IBM carbine production during World War II, but did not manufacture complete carbines until the introduction of this replica.  The AOM110 and AOM120 models (no longer produced) featured birch stocks and handguards, [[Parkerizing|Parkerized]] receivers, flip-style rear sights and barrel bands without bayonet lugs.

Inland Manufacturing, LLC is a private entity that is producing reproductions of the M1 Carbine and M1A1 Paratrooper models that were built by the original Inland Division of General Motors from 1941 to 1945.  The new Inland M1 carbines feature many of the same characteristics of the original Inland Carbines and are manufactured in the USA.  The M1 carbine is modeled after the last production model that Inland manufactured in 1945 and features a type 3 bayonet lug / barrel band, adjustable rear sights, push button safety, round bolt, and \"low wood\" walnut stock, and a 15-round magazine.  A 30-round mag catch was utilized to allow high-capacity magazines. A \"1944\" M1 Carbine is also available that has the same features as the 1945 only with a Type 2 barrel Band and 10-round magazine and is available for sale in most states with magazine capacity & bayonet lug restrictions. The M1A1 is modeled after a late production 1944 M1A1 Paratrooper model with a folding \"low wood\" walnut stock, Type two barrel band, and includes the same adjustable sights which were actually introduced in 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/inland-manufacturing-m1-carbines|title=Inland Manufacturing Releases 'American Classic' M1 Carbines|author=Robert A.

It is still popular with civilian shooters around the world and is prized as a historically significant collector's item. The Carbine continues to be used in military marksmanship training and competitive target matches conducted by rifle clubs affiliated with the [[Civilian Marksmanship Program]] (CMP).\n\nThe M1 carbine can be used for big-game hunting, such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[mule deer]] at close range (less than 100 yards), but is definitely underpowered for larger North American game such as [[elk]], [[moose]], and [[bear]].

The M1 Carbine is also prohibited for hunting in several states such as [[Pennsylvania]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pgc.pa.gov/HuntTrap/Law/Pages/HuntingandTrappingDigest.aspx|title=Hunting & Trapping Digest|website=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania}}</ref> because of the semi-automatic function, and [[Illinois]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dnr.state.il.us/admin/systems/Digest/Digest.pdf |title=Illinois: Digest of Hunting and Trapping Regulations 2007\u20132008, Statewide Deer Hunting Information|publisher=Illinois Department of Natural Resources|page=11\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227160129/http://dnr.state.il.us/admin/systems/Digest/Digest.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> which prohibits all non-muzzleloading rifles for big game hunting. Five-round magazines are commercially made for use in states that limit the capacity of semi-automatic hunting rifles.\n\nSome indoor pistol ranges may permit the firing of an M1 carbine, as its bullet is comparable to magnum handgun rounds, whereas an AR-15, AK-47 or other high-velocity rifle might penetrate the backstop.\n\nNew Jersey lists the \"M1 Carbine Type\" as a banned assault firearm although most examples of the M1 Carbine technically meet the restrictions on semi-automatic rifles identified by the state. Although not banned by name, make or model, M1 Carbines may in some cases be classified as contraband assault weapon under the 2013 NY SAFE act if they feature bayonet lugs, pistol grips, folding stocks and flash suppressors. 10-round magazines are available in states that restrict magazine capacity for civilian firearms.\n\nThe M1 carbine was also used by various law enforcement agencies and prison guards, and was prominently carried by riot police during the civil unrest of the late 1960s and early 1970s; until it was replaced in those roles by more modern .223 caliber semi-automatic rifles such as the [[Ruger Mini-14]] and the [[Colt AR-15]] type rifles in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe ease of use and great adaptability of the weapon led to it being used by [[Malcolm X]] and [[Patty Hearst]]. Both were featured in famous news photographs carrying the carbine.  An M1 was also the weapon used in the 1947 assassination of notorious American mobster [[Bugsy Siegel | Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel]].\n\n==Related equipment and accessories==\n===Ammunition types===\n{{Main|.30 Carbine}}\nThe ammunition used by the military with the carbine include:<ref>''TM 9-1305-200/TO 11A13-1-101 Small-Arms Ammunition'', 1961, pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Ball, M1\n* Cartridge, Grenade, Caliber .30, M6 (also authorized for other blank firing uses, due to a lack of a dedicated blank cartridge)\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Dummy, M13\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Ball, Test, High Pressure, M18\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Tracer, M16 (also rated as having an incendiary effect)\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Tracer, M27 (dimmer illumination and no incendiary effect)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of U.S. Army weapons by supply catalog designation]] SNL B-28\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Barnes, Frank C., ''Cartridges of the World'', Iola, WI: DBI Books Inc., {{ISBN|0-87349-033-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87349-033-7}}, (6th ed., 1989).\n* {{cite magazine|author=Canfield, Bruce N. |title=A New Lease on Life: The Post-World War II M1 Carbine |magazine=American Rifleman |date=June 2007}}\n* Dunlap, Roy F.

Game was also a staple of noblemen: [[European bison|wisents]], [[aurochs]], and deer were hunted. Lithuania had long-lasting wars (about 200 years) with Teutonic Order. It also kept diplomatic relationships with it, during which various presents were exchanged - it is known what Teutonic Order sent a rare wine to [[Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania]], wife of [[Vytautas the Great]], in 1416.

Bona Sforza introduced the fork and traditional Italian food - olives, olive oil; made wine and wheat flour more popular.

Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast - ''raugas'', which also had symbolical meaning of the home.  [[Rye bread]] is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, [[butter]]ed or spread with cheese. It is sometimes flavored with [[caraway]], or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on [[sweet flag]] leaves. Lithuanian proverb says - ''Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne'' (''One can manage without gold, but not without bread'').\n\nSome varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is referred to as ''gr\u016bd\u0117toji'', i.e. \"seeded\" bread.\n\n==Vegetables and spices==\n\n[[File:Illustration_Heracleum_sphondylium0.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Heracleum sphondylium]]'' (''Lankinis bar\u0161tis'') was used since prehistory up to the 18th century to make an archaic version of ''bar\u0161\u010diai'' soup]]\n\n[[File:Brassica rapa (watercolor).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Brassica rapa]]'' (rop\u0117) was a popular root vegetable before the prevalence of potatoes in the 18th century.]]\n\nThe most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the [[potato]]; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with [[dill]], but a tremendous{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} variety of potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.\n\n[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''baland\u0117liai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior.\n\nLithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back after independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.\n\nPickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.\n\n==Foraging: berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants==\n\nOne of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.\n\nMushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dz\u016bkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:\n* ''Baravykas'' \u2013 [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];\n* ''Voverait\u0117'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepe\u0161ka'' (in [[Dz\u016bkija]] region) \u2013 [[chanterelle]];\n* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vi\u0161tel\u0117'' \u2013 [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].\n\n''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voverait\u0117'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voverait\u0117'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lep\u0161\u0117'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonvir\u0161is'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''\u0161ilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.\n\nWild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''m\u0117lyn\u0117s'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''brukn\u0117s'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguol\u0117s'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[\u010cepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai'').

During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews ([[kompot]]s). [[Gooseberry|Gooseberries]] (''agrastai'') and [[Ribes|currant]]s (''serbentai'') are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese which is considered a desert is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family|Radvila family]] chef from the 17th century.\n\n==Meat==\n[[File:Salo.JPG|200px|thumb|A small slab of ''la\u0161iniai'' with an onion]]\n[[File:Skilandis2.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' is a Lithuanian matured sausage made of meat, fat, salt, pepper and garlic.

There are many varieties of smoked pork, including [[ham]] and a soft [[sausage]] with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. [[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.\n\n==Fish==\n\nFreshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]].

Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; [[curd cheese]] (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream is unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on.

Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.\n*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Jonin\u0117s]]), June 23.\n*Christmas Eve ([[K\u016b\u010dios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.\n*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a [[\u0161akotis]] is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.\n*Funerals - The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners at a restaurant or other similar venue.\n*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties - The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian [[smorgasbord]], topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth.

Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic [[Festival|festivities]] and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|website=www.llti.lt|page=18|title=Alus \u2013 apeiginis balt\u0173 g\u0117rimas|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808021048/http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was ''Ragutis'' or ''R\u016bgutis''. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.\n\nFarmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.\n\n===Midus===\n\n''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey.

One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], who visited [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].

The archeological finds reveal that bread in the 9th - 14th centuries in Lithuania was very similar to the current rye bread.<ref>{{cite web|title=K\u0105 lietuviai valg\u0117 IX\u2013XIV am\u017eiuje: VU archeolog\u0117s i\u0161tyr\u0117 pirm\u0105 lietuvi\u0161k\u0105 duon\u0105|url=https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/ka-lietuviai-valge-ix-xiv-amziuje-vu-archeologes-istyre-pirma-lietuviska-duona-56-986676|website=www.15min.lt|accessdate=14 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> The dough is usually based on a [[sourdough]] [[Pre-ferment|starter]], and includes some wheat flour to lighten the finished product. Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast - ''raugas'', which also had symbolical meaning of the home.  [[Rye bread]] is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, [[butter]]ed or spread with cheese. It is sometimes flavored with [[caraway]], or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on [[sweet flag]] leaves. Lithuanian proverb says - ''Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne'' (''One can manage without gold, but not without bread'').\n\nSome varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is referred to as ''gr\u016bd\u0117toji'', i.e. \"seeded\" bread.\n\n==Vegetables and spices==\n\n[[File:Illustration_Heracleum_sphondylium0.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Heracleum sphondylium]]'' (''Lankinis bar\u0161tis'') was used since prehistory up to the 18th century to make an archaic version of ''bar\u0161\u010diai'' soup]]\n\n[[File:Brassica rapa (watercolor).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Brassica rapa]]'' (rop\u0117) was a popular root vegetable before the prevalence of potatoes in the 18th century.]]\n\nThe most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the [[potato]]; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with [[dill]], but a tremendous{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} variety of potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.\n\n[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''baland\u0117liai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior.\n\nLithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back after independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.\n\nPickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.\n\n==Foraging: berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants==\n\nOne of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.\n\nMushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dz\u016bkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:\n* ''Baravykas'' \u2013 [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];\n* ''Voverait\u0117'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepe\u0161ka'' (in [[Dz\u016bkija]] region) \u2013 [[chanterelle]];\n* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vi\u0161tel\u0117'' \u2013 [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].\n\n''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voverait\u0117'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voverait\u0117'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lep\u0161\u0117'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonvir\u0161is'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''\u0161ilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.\n\nWild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''m\u0117lyn\u0117s'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''brukn\u0117s'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguol\u0117s'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[\u010cepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai''). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. [[Fragaria vesca|Wild strawberries]] (''\u017eemuog\u0117s'') are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Foraging\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"165\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Boletus edulis EtgHollande 041031 091.jpg|Boletus, the \"King of Mushrooms\"\nFile:Chanterelle Cantharellus cibarius.jpg|[[Chanterelle]]s are popular mushrooms in Lithuania\nFile:Vaccinium vitis-idaea 20060824 003.jpg|Lingonberry\nFile:\u010cu\u010doriedky.jpg|Bilberry\nFile:Suillus brevipes 78.jpg|Butter-mushroom\nFile:Fragaria_vesca_2.jpg|Strawberry\nFile:Glyceria fluitans \u2014 Flora Batava \u2014 Volume v8.jpg|''[[Glyceria fluitans]]'' (''paprastoji mona\u017eol\u0117'').

During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews ([[kompot]]s). [[Gooseberry|Gooseberries]] (''agrastai'') and [[Ribes|currant]]s (''serbentai'') are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese which is considered a desert is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family|Radvila family]] chef from the 17th century.\n\n==Meat==\n[[File:Salo.JPG|200px|thumb|A small slab of ''la\u0161iniai'' with an onion]]\n[[File:Skilandis2.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' is a Lithuanian matured sausage made of meat, fat, salt, pepper and garlic.

There are many varieties of smoked pork, including [[ham]] and a soft [[sausage]] with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. [[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.\n\n==Fish==\n\nFreshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]]. Since the 19th century, herring was imported to Lithuania from Norway, [[Stavanger]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grin\u010dinaitis |first1=Sigitas |title=Kaip j\u016bros sidabras - silk\u0117s - atkeliavo \u012f Lietuv\u0105? |url=http://www.silutesnaujienos.lt/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16082:kaip-jros-sidabras-silks-atkeliavo-lietuv&catid=57:istorija&Itemid=102 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> [[Salmon]] is also a popular dish often served with a cream sauce, vegetables, and rice. Before building dams after Soviet occupation, salmon was quite abundant fish in Lithuanian rivers.\n\nSmoked fish such as [[eel]] or [[bream]] are popular entrees and appetizers in areas near the [[Baltic Sea]], especially in [[Neringa Municipality|Neringa]].\n\n[[Crayfish]] are also popular and are usually eaten in the summertime as a delicacy and a side dish served with beer.\n\n==Dairy products==\n\nLithuania is known for quality dairy products. Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; [[curd cheese]] (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream is unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on. Lithuanian curd snacks called ''s\u016breliai'' are popular too. Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though many people still prefer making their own soured milk.\n\n===Cheese===\n\nTraditional Lithuanian curd cheese has a [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Geographical Indication]] (PGI) label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luksiupienine.lt/en/prod/curd-cheese-tradicional-liethuanian/|title= Traditional \"Senoli\u0173 Lietuvi\u0161kas\"|website=www.luksiupienine.lt|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> The most popular way of eating Lithuanian non-fermented white cheese is with fresh honey; it can also be cooked with spices and enjoyed with tea.

The diners touch their eggs together as a sort of toast (among the children, this custom sometimes devolves into a smashing contest). Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.\n*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Jonin\u0117s]]), June 23.\n*Christmas Eve ([[K\u016b\u010dios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.\n*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a [[\u0161akotis]] is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.\n*Funerals - The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners at a restaurant or other similar venue.\n*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties - The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian [[smorgasbord]], topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth. Flavored vodkas, which may have been concocted with fruits and herbs according to the host's or hostess's own family recipe, may be served.\n\n==Drinks==\n\n===Beer===\n{{Main|Beer in Lithuania}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | caption_align     = left\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n | total_width       = 400\n | header            = \n | header_align      = left/right/center\n | header_background = \n | footer            = \n | footer_align      = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width             = \n | image1            = Lithuanian-beer.jpg\n | width1            = \n | caption1          = Traditional Lithuanian beer has an earthy and yeasty flavour, rich color of the clay or straw.\n | image2            = Bir\u017e\u0173 1686 Jubiliejinis Alus (9834933134).jpg\n | width2            = \n | caption2          = Bir\u017e\u0173 alus.

Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic [[Festival|festivities]] and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|website=www.llti.lt|page=18|title=Alus \u2013 apeiginis balt\u0173 g\u0117rimas|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808021048/http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was ''Ragutis'' or ''R\u016bgutis''. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.\n\nFarmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.\n\n===Midus===\n\n''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey. [[Baltic people]] were making ''midus'' for thousands of years. One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], who visited [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].  Old Lithuanian mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kublickas |first1=Rimantas |title=Traditional Foods |pages=339\u2013343 |chapter=Midus: A Traditional Lithuanian Mead |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7648-2_27 |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4899-7646-8 }}</ref>\nOldest recipe of Lithuanian ''midus'' was recorded in a book by [[Olaus Magnus]] ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'', published in Rome in 1555.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Lau\u017eikas R. |author2=Astrauskas A. |title=How the Future King of England Ate Peacock in Vilnius: the Shared Cultural, Political and Culinary History of Britain and Lithuania |date=2018 |publisher=Lietuvos kult\u016bros institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=9786098015652 |pages=135}}</ref>  ''Midus'' was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry.

Initiatives of B.Karazija made a fruit wine a traditional drink in Lithuania. Currently blueberry, apple, apple ice wine, black currant, aronia, cherry wines being produced by smaller and bigger companies.\n\n===Other===\n*''Arbata ([[tea]])'' - [[chamomile]], [[rosehip]], [[thyme]] and other herbal teas are popular as well as black tea. Many herbal infusions are used for medicinal purposes.\n*''Gira ([[kvass]])'' is a non-alcoholic beverage made by the natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian [[kvass]]. Those brewed from rye [[bread]] and from [[caraway]] seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.\n*''Degtin\u0117 (\"the burn\")'' is the Lithuanian version of [[vodka]], traditionally made from rye. Produced domestically, its quality ranges from basic to triple-[[Distilled beverage|distilled]].\n*''Kava ([[coffee]])'' is brewed in [[espresso]] makers or [[Moka pot|moka pots]] at home, or with espresso machines in cafes. It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (''kavin\u0117'') can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made ''gili\u0173 kava'' (acorn coffee) - a substitute for natural bean coffee. The first coffeehouses appeared in Lithuania in the 18th century and in 1814 there were 49 coffeehouses in Vilnius.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balsevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117-\u0160lekien\u0117 |first1=Virginija |title=Vilniaus kavin\u0117s istoriniuose \u0161altiniuose ir memuaruose |url=http://www.su.lt/bylos/fakultetai/humanitarinis/ml/acta/acta-h-15/slekiene.pdf |accessdate=2 May 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref> Journalist Rapolas Mackonis was explorer of cafe life and wrote about culture of cafes in Vilnius and Kaunas. \n*''[[Starka]]'', an aged vodka, as well as [[Krupnikas]], a honey liqueur, are traditional drinks dating from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 16th - 18th centuries.\n*''[[Bitters|Trauktin\u0117]]'' (a bitter) is a strong herbal vodka; there are many varieties.

The wine exhibition ''Vyno dienos'' (''Days of Wine'') taking place in May, is the largest wine exhibition in Northern Europe.

Originally from [[Tasmania]], Hudson played with [[New Norfolk Eagles|New Norfolk Football Club]], in the [[Tasmanian Football League]] before crossing to [[Hawthorn Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] (now the Australian Football League); following his Hawthorn days he returned to Tasmania, playing for [[Glenorchy Football Club]] during which he kicked an amazing 616 goals in 81 games at a phenomenal 7.61 goals per game.\n\nOver his career, he kicked 1,721 goals in 288 premiership games between 1963 and 1979, and 1981. His final match was in the 1981 [[Tasmanian Football League|TANFL]] Preliminary Final for Glenorchy, where Hudson, who had made a brief comeback with two rounds remaining due to Glenorchy having a string of injuries, kicked 30 goals in three matches, including six in his team's Preliminary Final loss to New Norfolk. Hudson was kept goalless just four times during his career in premiership matches by Richmond's [[Barry Richardson (Australian rules footballer)|Barry Richardson]] in Round 7 of 1969, Collingwood's [[Ian Cooper (Australian footballer born 1946)|Ian Cooper]] in Round 2 of 1974, Carlton's [[Rod Austin]] in Round 14 of 1977 and in the TANFL, Bruce Greenhill of [[Sandy Bay Football Club|Sandy Bay]] in 1978.\n\nSome sources list Hudson as playing 107 games and kicking 769 goals for Glenorchy for a TANFL total of 185 games and 1,147 goals, and a career total of 314 games and 1,875 goals. These discrepancies arise from the TANFL including goals scored in intrastate matches representing the TANFL in TANFL player's career statistics at that time, a ruling that was later rescinded.<ref name=\"age1\">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/29/1056825277701.html |title=Hudson the legend now a life member |date=30 June 2003 |publisher=The Age |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nIf the Tasmanian competitions, representative and night series games are considered, Hudson played an overall total of 372 matches and kicked 2,191 goals \u2013 an average of 5.89 goals a game over his entire career \u2013 making him the highest goalkicker in elite Australian rules football history.\n\nHudson's ability to win the ball was hard to pinpoint. There were times he seemed to gain possession of the ball ever so quietly and with consistent, nonchalant ease, his tally of goals for the game would gradually climb. Among his armoury of skills, he seemed to have the ability to quietly sneak away from the opposition attendant full-back.

Originally from [[Tasmania]], Hudson played with [[New Norfolk Eagles|New Norfolk Football Club]], in the [[Tasmanian Football League]] before crossing to [[Hawthorn Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] (now the Australian Football League); following his Hawthorn days he returned to Tasmania, playing for [[Glenorchy Football Club]] during which he kicked an amazing 616 goals in 81 games at a phenomenal 7.61 goals per game.\n\nOver his career, he kicked 1,721 goals in 288 premiership games between 1963 and 1979, and 1981. His final match was in the 1981 [[Tasmanian Football League|TANFL]] Preliminary Final for Glenorchy, where Hudson, who had made a brief comeback with two rounds remaining due to Glenorchy having a string of injuries, kicked 30 goals in three matches, including six in his team's Preliminary Final loss to New Norfolk. Hudson was kept goalless just four times during his career in premiership matches by Richmond's [[Barry Richardson (Australian rules footballer)|Barry Richardson]] in Round 7 of 1969, Collingwood's [[Ian Cooper (Australian footballer born 1946)|Ian Cooper]] in Round 2 of 1974, Carlton's [[Rod Austin]] in Round 14 of 1977 and in the TANFL, Bruce Greenhill of [[Sandy Bay Football Club|Sandy Bay]] in 1978.\n\nSome sources list Hudson as playing 107 games and kicking 769 goals for Glenorchy for a TANFL total of 185 games and 1,147 goals, and a career total of 314 games and 1,875 goals. These discrepancies arise from the TANFL including goals scored in intrastate matches representing the TANFL in TANFL player's career statistics at that time, a ruling that was later rescinded.<ref name=\"age1\">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/29/1056825277701.html |title=Hudson the legend now a life member |date=30 June 2003 |publisher=The Age |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nIf the Tasmanian competitions, representative and night series games are considered, Hudson played an overall total of 372 matches and kicked 2,191 goals \u2013 an average of 5.89 goals a game over his entire career \u2013 making him the highest goalkicker in elite Australian rules football history.\n\nHudson's ability to win the ball was hard to pinpoint. There were times he seemed to gain possession of the ball ever so quietly and with consistent, nonchalant ease, his tally of goals for the game would gradually climb. Among his armoury of skills, he seemed to have the ability to quietly sneak away from the opposition attendant full-back. Before the frustrated backman knew it, Hudson had taken a nice comfortable mark on his chest for a simple goal.\n\n== VFL career ==\nIn a Victorian Football League career beginning with the Hawthorn Football Club in 1967, he kicked 727 goals at an average of 5.64 a game.\n\nHudson won the [[Coleman Medal]] for the League's leading goal kicker four times in his career: in 1968 (125 goals); 1970 (146); 1971 (150); and 1977 (110). He also became the first player to kick 100 goals in a VFL season five times (the other year he exceeded 100 goals being 1969 when he kicked 120, but did not win the Coleman).\n\nIn 1971 he equalled [[Bob Pratt]]'s [[List of VFL/AFL records|record]] of 150 goals in a season after kicking three goals in Hawthorn's winning [[1971 VFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] side.

He studied medicine from 1967 onwards in [[T\u00fcbingen]], [[Freiburg]], [[Berlin]], [[Paris]] and [[Munich]].  After completing his medical exams at Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, he became a medical assistant in 1968 at [[Munich University]], while also working as a scientific assistant (Wissenschaftlicher Assistant) at Munich's [[Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Psychiatrie]], in the [[Neurophysiology]] Department under [[Otto Detlev Creutzfeldt]].  In 1971 he moved to [[University College London]], where he worked in the Department of [[Biophysics]] under [[Bernard Katz]].  In 1974, he completed his medical dissertation, under the title ''Elektrophysiologie der neuralen Helladaptation in der Katzenretina'' (''[[Electrophysiology]] of Neural Light Adaption in the Cat Retina'') in the Medical Faculty of G\u00f6ttingen University.<ref name=\"nobio\"/>\n\nAfterwards (still in 1974), Sakmann returned to the lab of Otto Creutzfeldt, who had meanwhile moved to the [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]] in G\u00f6ttingen.  Sakmann joined the membrane biology group in 1979.\n\nOn 2 June 2009, [[Peter Gruss]], the president of the Max Planck Society, announced that Sakmann would serve as the scientific director of the Max Planck Florida Institute, the organization's biomedical research facility at [[Florida Atlantic University]] in [[Jupiter, Florida]].\n\nSakmann is the founder of the Bert-Sakmann-Stiftung.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 1986, he and [[Erwin Neher]] were awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]]. In 1987, he received the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], which is the highest honour awarded in German research. In 1991, he received the [[Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience]], the [[Harvey Prize]] and the [[Nobel prize]] for [[Physiology]] or [[Medicine]] along with Neher, with whom he had worked in G\u00f6ttingen.<ref name=\"nobio\"/> He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1994|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1994]].<ref name=formemrs/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Scholia|author}}\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n{{Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Laureates 1976-2000}}\n{{1991 Nobel Prize winners}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n{{FRS 1994}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sakmann, Bert}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Alumni of University College London]]\n[[Category:Members of the European Molecular Biology Organization]]\n[[Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni]]\n[[Category:German biologists]]\n[[Category:German Nobel laureates]]\n[[Category:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners]]\n[[Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine]]\n[[Category:Scientists from Stuttgart]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)]]\n[[Category:University of Freiburg alumni]]\n[[Category:Heidelberg University faculty]]\n[[Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni]]\n[[Category:Max Planck Society people]]\n[[Category:Electrophysiologists]]\n", "name_user": "Grimes2", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:order", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Sakmann"}
