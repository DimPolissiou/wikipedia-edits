It was a [[streetcar line]] until the 1960s.\n\n==Route Description and Service==\nRoute 42 operates at nearly all hours of the day during the week, with slightly reduced hours on weekends. Route 43 operates rush hours only, in the peak direction (inbound in the morning, outbound in the evening). Both routes operate out of Western division but some rush hour trips are covered by Four Mile Run. \n\nRoutes 42 and 43 begins at Mount Pleasant Street and [[17th Street (Washington, D.C.)|17th Street NW]] in [[Mount Pleasant, DC|Mount Pleasant]], and heads south on Mount Pleasant Street NW and Columbia Road NW until it arrives at an intersection with [[Connecticut Avenue (Washington)|Connecticut Avenue NW]] and California Street NW. The routes turns southbound onto Connecticut Avenue, continuing south towards [[Dupont Circle]]. Route 42 travels around the circle, providing access to the [[Dupont Circle station]] on the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]] at both Q Street and just south of the circle. Route 43 travels via the Connecticut Avenue underpass, bypassing these two stops as well as a northbound stop at R Street. The routes then continue to [[Farragut Square]], where Route 43 terminates.\n\nRoute 42 turns east, traveling eastbound on the one-way [[H Street (Washington, D.C.)|H Street NW]] and westbound along [[I Street (Washington, D.C.)|I Street NW]]. It continues along this one-way pair for a few blocks, then turning south onto [[9th Street (Washington, D.C.)|9th Street NW]] southbound and from [[11th Street (Washington, D.C.)|11th Street NW]] northbound. The route terminates at the intersection of 9th and [[F Street (Washington, D.C.)|F Streets NW]] near the [[Gallery Place station]] on the Red, [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow]], and [[Green Line (Washington Metro)|Green Line]]s.\n\n===Routes 42 and 43 stops===\n\n<section begin=42dc43-table/>\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!Bus

Electric Company, during the year of 1872. The horse streetcars, which these lines originally operated on, were eventually replaced by electric streetcars between the years of 1896 & 1900. While 40 operated all the way between Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Northwest Washington D.C. & Seat Pleasant, MD, via Downtown Washington D.C., 42 only operated between the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Northwest Washington D.C. & Kingman Park neighborhood of Northeast Washington D.C., via Downtown Washington D.C.  <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagorailfan.com/wasdated.html|title=WASHINGTON DC TRANSIT ROUTES|website=www.chicagorailfan.com|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref> Both routes began at Mount Pleasant and ran to H Street, turning east there, south on [[14th Street (Washington, D.C.)|14th Street NW]], and east on [[F Street (Washington, D.C.)|F Street NW]] along the F Street Line. At [[5th Street (Washington, D.C.)|5th Street NW]], Route 40 turned south, continuing east around the north side of the [[U.S. Capitol|Capitol]] and along [[East Capitol Street]] to 15th Street NE, while Route 42 turned north and east past [[Union Station (Washington)|Union Station]] on the East Washington Line, ending at [[D Street (Washington, D.C.)|D Street NE]] and 13th Street NE. On the other hand, 40 would operate further east towards Seat Pleasant, MD, via East Capitol Street NE, Southern Avenue NE, 63rd Street NE, Eastern Avenue NE, 61rst Street NE, Dix Street NE, 63rd Street NE, Southern Avenue NE, & East Capitol Street NE.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 40 & 42 streetcar lines were replaced by buses on December 3, 1961 (Route 42) and January 28, 1962 (Route 40)<ref name=\":0\" />. Eventually, on February 4, 1973, the 40 & 42 Mount Pleasant Line bus routes were converted into WMATA Metrobus Routes when WMATA acquired four bus companies that operated throughout the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area and merged them all together to form its own, \"Metrobus\" System.<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n===March 27, 1976 Service Changes===\nOn March 27, 1976 when the Farrugut North, Metro Center, Judiciary Square, and Union Station opened, 40 & 42 began serving each of the Metro stations in the middle of the routes. No route changes were made during this particular time.\n\n===January 17, 1977===\nOn January 17, 1977 when the Dupont Circle Metro Station opened, both the 40 & 42 Metrobus Routes began serving the Dupont Circle Metro Station in the middle of their routes. No route changes were made during this particular time. \n\n===September 24, 1978 Route Changes===\nOn  September 24, 1978, the 42 Metrobus Route was extended southeast of its original terminus at the intersection of D Street NE & 13th Street NE in the Kingman Park neighborhood of Northeast Washington D.C., to instead terminate at the newly opened Stadium Armory Metro Station. 40, on the other hand, went through a minor rerouting change to serve the newly opened Stadium Armory Metro Station, in the middle of its route between Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Northwest Washington D.C. & Seat Pleasant, MD, via Downtown Washington D.C. 40 & 42 also went through another minor rerouting change to serve the DC General Hospital, located adjacent to the Stadium Armory Metro Station. During this same exact time, WMATA created its brand new 44 Metrobus Route to operate parallel to the 42 Metrobus Route between the Stadium Armory Metro Station & Mount Pleasant, in order to alleviate crowding/provide additional Metrobus service on the Mount Pleasant Line between those two points. WMATA also created its brand new 46 Metrobus Route to provide brand new Metrobus service between the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Northwest Washington D.C. and the Kennedy Center in Downtown Washington D.C.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1981/01/01/new-subway-stops-bring-metrobus-service-changes/73567225-0882-45fa-b9b3-b8a9bacf17f6/|title=New Subway Stops Bring Metrobus Service Changes|last=|first=|date=January 1, 1981|website=Washington Post|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref>.\n\n===January 4, 1981 Route Changes===\nOn January 4, 1981, roughly two months after the [[Capitol Heights station|Capitol Heights Metro Station]] opened, the 40 Metrobus Route was truncated to only operate between [[Mount Pleasant (Washington, D.C.)|Mount Pleasant]] & the newly opened [[Capitol Heights station|Capitol Heights Metro Station]], via [[Metro Center station|Metro Center]] in [[Downtown (Washington, D.C.)|Downtown Washington D.C.]], the [[Union Station (Washington Metro)|Union Station]], and [[Stadium\u2013Armory station|Stadium Armory Metro Station]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The segment of 42's routing between the [[Capitol Heights station|Capitol Heights Metro Station]] & former terminus in [[Seat Pleasant, Maryland|Seat Pleasant, MD]], was taken over/replaced by the F14 Metrobus Route, which was rerouted to operate between the [[New Carrollton station|New Carrollton Metro Station]] & Bradbury Heights, via the newly opened [[Capitol Heights station|Capitol Heights]] & [[Addison Road station|Addison Road]] Metro Stations, instead of operating between the [[New Carrollton station|New Carrollton]] & [[Deanwood station|Deanwood]] Metro Stations. The U8 Metrobus Route also began operating on this particular segment of 42 & 44's route between [[Seat Pleasant, Maryland|Seat Pleasant]] & the [[Capitol Heights station|Capitol Heights Metro Station]], during the early 1990s once it was introduced. No changes were made to the 42, 44, & 46 Metrobus Routes, which operated as part of the Mount Pleasant Line<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n===March, 1995 Route Changes===\nEventually, in March, 1995, both the 40 & 44 Metrobus Routes were discontinued and 42 was truncated to only operate between [[Mount Pleasant (Washington, D.C.)|Mount Pleasant]] & [[Metro Center station|Metro Center]]. The segment of 40, 42, & 44's route between [[Metro Center station|Metro Center]] & the [[Union Station (Washington Metro)|Union Station]], was completely taken over/replaced by the \"Sibley Hospital-Stadium Armory\" Line Metrobus Routes D1, D3, & D6.

It was a [[streetcar line]] until the 1960s.\n\n==Route Description and Service==\nRoute 42 operates at nearly all hours of the day during the week, with slightly reduced hours on weekends. Route 43 operates rush hours only, in the peak direction (inbound in the morning, outbound in the evening). Both routes operate out of Western division but some rush hour trips are covered by Four Mile Run. \n\nRoutes 42 and 43 begins at Mount Pleasant Street and [[17th Street (Washington, D.C.)|17th Street NW]] in [[Mount Pleasant, DC|Mount Pleasant]], and heads south on Mount Pleasant Street NW and Columbia Road NW until it arrives at an intersection with [[Connecticut Avenue (Washington)|Connecticut Avenue NW]] and California Street NW. The routes turns southbound onto Connecticut Avenue, continuing south towards [[Dupont Circle]]. Route 42 travels around the circle, providing access to the [[Dupont Circle station]] on the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]] at both Q Street and just south of the circle. Route 43 travels via the Connecticut Avenue underpass, bypassing these two stops as well as a northbound stop at R Street. The routes then continue to [[Farragut Square]], where Route 43 terminates.\n\nRoute 42 turns east, traveling eastbound on the one-way [[H Street (Washington, D.C.)|H Street NW]] and westbound along [[I Street (Washington, D.C.)|I Street NW]]. It continues along this one-way pair for a few blocks, then turning south onto [[9th Street (Washington, D.C.)|9th Street NW]] southbound and from [[11th Street (Washington, D.C.)|11th Street NW]] northbound. The route terminates at the intersection of 9th and [[F Street (Washington, D.C.)|F Streets NW]] near the [[Gallery Place station]] on the Red, [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow]], and [[Green Line (Washington Metro)|Green Line]]s.\n\n===Routes 42 and 43 stops===\n\n<section begin=42dc43-table/>\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!Bus

Electric Company, during the year of 1872. The horse streetcars, which these lines originally operated on, were eventually replaced by electric streetcars between the years of 1896 & 1900. While 40 operated all the way between Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Northwest Washington D.C. & Seat Pleasant, MD, via Downtown Washington D.C., 42 only operated between the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Northwest Washington D.C. & Kingman Park neighborhood of Northeast Washington D.C., via Downtown Washington D.C.  <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagorailfan.com/wasdated.html|title=WASHINGTON DC TRANSIT ROUTES|website=www.chicagorailfan.com|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref> Both routes began at Mount Pleasant and ran to H Street, turning east there, south on [[14th Street (Washington, D.C.)|14th Street NW]], and east on [[F Street (Washington, D.C.)|F Street NW]] along the F Street Line. At [[5th Street (Washington, D.C.)|5th Street NW]], Route 40 turned south, continuing east around the north side of the [[U.S. Capitol|Capitol]] and along [[East Capitol Street]] to 15th Street NE, while Route 42 turned north and east past [[Union Station (Washington)|Union Station]] on the East Washington Line, ending at [[D Street (Washington, D.C.)|D Street NE]] and 13th Street NE. On the other hand, 40 would operate further east towards Seat Pleasant, MD, via East Capitol Street NE, Southern Avenue NE, 63rd Street NE, Eastern Avenue NE, 61rst Street NE, Dix Street NE, 63rd Street NE, Southern Avenue NE, & East Capitol Street NE.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 40 & 42 streetcar lines were replaced by buses on December 3, 1961 (Route 42) and January 28, 1962 (Route 40)<ref name=\":0\" />. Eventually, on February 4, 1973, the 40 & 42 Mount Pleasant Line bus routes were converted into WMATA Metrobus Routes when WMATA acquired four bus companies that operated throughout the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area and merged them all together to form its own, \"Metrobus\" System.<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n===March 27, 1976 Service Changes===\nOn March 27, 1976 when the Farrugut North, Metro Center, Judiciary Square, and Union Station opened, 40 & 42 began serving each of the Metro stations in the middle of the routes. No route changes were made during this particular time.\n\n===January 17, 1977===\nOn January 17, 1977 when the Dupont Circle Metro Station opened, both the 40 & 42 Metrobus Routes began serving the Dupont Circle Metro Station in the middle of their routes. No route changes were made during this particular time. \n\n===September 24, 1978 Route Changes===\nOn  September 24, 1978, the 42 Metrobus Route was extended southeast of its original terminus at the intersection of D Street NE & 13th Street NE in the Kingman Park neighborhood of Northeast Washington D.C., to instead terminate at the newly opened Stadium Armory Metro Station. 40, on the other hand, went through a minor rerouting change to serve the newly opened Stadium Armory Metro Station, in the middle of its route between Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Northwest Washington D.C. & Seat Pleasant, MD, via Downtown Washington D.C. 40 & 42 also went through another minor rerouting change to serve the DC General Hospital, located adjacent to the Stadium Armory Metro Station. During this same exact time, WMATA created its brand new 44 Metrobus Route to operate parallel to the 42 Metrobus Route between the Stadium Armory Metro Station & Mount Pleasant, in order to alleviate crowding/provide additional Metrobus service on the Mount Pleasant Line between those two points. WMATA also created its brand new 46 Metrobus Route to provide brand new Metrobus service between the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Northwest Washington D.C. and the Kennedy Center in Downtown Washington D.C.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1981/01/01/new-subway-stops-bring-metrobus-service-changes/73567225-0882-45fa-b9b3-b8a9bacf17f6/|title=New Subway Stops Bring Metrobus Service Changes|last=|first=|date=January 1, 1981|website=Washington Post|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref>.\n\n===January 4, 1981 Route Changes===\nOn January 4, 1981, roughly two months after the [[Capitol Heights station|Capitol Heights Metro Station]] opened, the 40 Metrobus Route was truncated to only operate between [[Mount Pleasant (Washington, D.C.)|Mount Pleasant]] & the newly opened [[Capitol Heights station|Capitol Heights Metro Station]], via [[Metro Center station|Metro Center]] in [[Downtown (Washington, D.C.)|Downtown Washington D.C.]], the [[Union Station (Washington Metro)|Union Station]], and [[Stadium\u2013Armory station|Stadium Armory Metro Station]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The segment of 42's routing between the [[Capitol Heights station|Capitol Heights Metro Station]] & former terminus in [[Seat Pleasant, Maryland|Seat Pleasant, MD]], was taken over/replaced by the F14 Metrobus Route, which was rerouted to operate between the [[New Carrollton station|New Carrollton Metro Station]] & Bradbury Heights, via the newly opened [[Capitol Heights station|Capitol Heights]] & [[Addison Road station|Addison Road]] Metro Stations, instead of operating between the [[New Carrollton station|New Carrollton]] & [[Deanwood station|Deanwood]] Metro Stations. The U8 Metrobus Route also began operating on this particular segment of 42 & 44's route between [[Seat Pleasant, Maryland|Seat Pleasant]] & the [[Capitol Heights station|Capitol Heights Metro Station]], during the early 1990s once it was introduced. No changes were made to the 42, 44, & 46 Metrobus Routes, which operated as part of the Mount Pleasant Line<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n===March, 1995 Route Changes===\nEventually, in March, 1995, both the 40 & 44 Metrobus Routes were discontinued and 42 was truncated to only operate between [[Mount Pleasant (Washington, D.C.)|Mount Pleasant]] & [[Metro Center station|Metro Center]]. The segment of 40, 42, & 44's route between [[Metro Center station|Metro Center]] & the [[Union Station (Washington Metro)|Union Station]], was completely taken over/replaced by the \"Sibley Hospital-Stadium Armory\" Line Metrobus Routes D1, D3, & D6.

Star 69's first two EPs were recorded in Patch's recording studio, Blah Street, in 1996 and released by Organic Records. Julie wanted to move back to [[Los Angeles]], but Hannan's position as drummer for The Sundays meant he had to record the album ''[[Static & Silence]]''.

Introduced in the 1991 [[Timothy Zahn]] novel ''Heir to the Empire'', he is an Imperial military commander who has taken control of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]'s remaining forces five years after the events of the 1983 film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. Thrawn faces off against classic ''Star Wars'' characters [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Princess Leia]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], and [[Lando Calrissian]] in the ''Thrawn'' trilogy (1991\u20131993), but is ultimately defeated. He is seemingly resurrected in the ''Hand of Thrawn'' duology (1997\u201398), and his backstory is explored in various other novels, short stories, comics, and video games in the [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]].\n\nThough [[Lucasfilm]] rebranded the Expanded Universe works as ''Star Wars'' Legends in 2014 and declared them non-[[Star Wars canon|canon]] to the franchise, Thrawn was nevertheless reintroduced back into the canon in the third season of the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[Animated series|animated television series]] ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', voiced by [[Lars Mikkelsen]].

To this end, Thrawn and his subordinate [[Gilad Pellaeon]], captain of the [[Star Destroyer]] ''Chimaera'', enlist the help of smuggler Talon Karrde and his second-in-command Mara Jade to obtain several salamander-like creatures called [[ysalamiri]]. Thrawn uses the ysalamiri, which possess the natural ability to disrupt the Force, to subdue the storehouse's guardian [[Joruus C'baoth]], a twisted clone of a [[Jedi Master]] whom the Grand Admiral had killed years before. C'baoth offers his allegiance in exchange for two acolytes to bend to his will: Darth Vader's twin children, Luke and Leia. Thrawn sends some of his [[Noghri]] killers to capture Luke and a pregnant Leia, but their attempts repeatedly fail. Leia defends herself from one attack, and is surprised when the Noghri suddenly surrenders. Thrawn launches his first offensive, a series of hit-and-run attacks into New Republic territory, and then steals a complement of mole miners from [[Lando Calrissian]]'s mining operations on [[Nkllon]]. In need of warships, and with his previous tactics having forced over 100 lightly manned ships to be stationed at the [[Sluis Van]] shipyards as he planned, Thrawn invades. His [[stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]] use the stolen miners to board and hijack the ships, but they are thwarted when Lando is able to seize control of the miners remotely.

Introduced in the 1991 [[Timothy Zahn]] novel ''Heir to the Empire'', he is an Imperial military commander who has taken control of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]'s remaining forces five years after the events of the 1983 film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. Thrawn faces off against classic ''Star Wars'' characters [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Princess Leia]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], and [[Lando Calrissian]] in the ''Thrawn'' trilogy (1991\u20131993), but is ultimately defeated. He is seemingly resurrected in the ''Hand of Thrawn'' duology (1997\u201398), and his backstory is explored in various other novels, short stories, comics, and video games in the [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]].\n\nThough [[Lucasfilm]] rebranded the expanded universe works as ''Star Wars Legends'' in 2014 and declared them non-[[Star Wars canon|canon]] to the franchise, Thrawn was nevertheless reintroduced back into the canon in the third season of the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[Animated series|animated television series]] ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', voiced by [[Lars Mikkelsen]]. ''Rebels'' is set at a point in the ''Star Wars'' timeline earlier than Thrawn's storylines in the ''Legends'' continuity. The character is also featured in a new ''Thrawn'' book trilogy by Zahn, consisting of ''[[Star Wars: Thrawn]]'' (2017), ''Thrawn: Alliances'' (2018) and ''Treason'' (2019).

To this end, Thrawn and his subordinate [[Gilad Pellaeon]], captain of the [[Star Destroyer]] ''Chimaera'', enlist the help of smuggler Talon Karrde and his second-in-command Mara Jade to obtain several salamander-like creatures called [[ysalamiri]]. Thrawn uses the ysalamiri, which possess the natural ability to disrupt the Force, to subdue the storehouse's guardian [[Joruus C'baoth]], a twisted clone of a [[Jedi Master]] whom the Grand Admiral had killed years before. C'baoth offers his allegiance in exchange for two acolytes to bend to his will: Darth Vader's twin children, Luke and Leia. Thrawn sends some of his [[Noghri]] killers to capture Luke and a pregnant Leia, but their attempts repeatedly fail. Leia defends herself from one attack, and is surprised when the Noghri suddenly surrenders. Thrawn launches his first offensive, a series of hit-and-run attacks into New Republic territory, and then steals a complement of mole miners from [[Lando Calrissian]]'s mining operations on [[Nkllon]]. In need of warships, and with his previous tactics having forced over 100 lightly manned ships to be stationed at the [[Sluis Van]] shipyards as he planned, Thrawn invades. His [[stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]] use the stolen miners to board and hijack the ships, but they are thwarted when Lando is able to seize control of the miners remotely.

Born Craig Kirrin Gore in fairfield New South Wales on January 7, 1967. He is the Son of [[Sanctuary Cove, Queensland|Sanctuary Cove]] Developer Mike Gore. Craig Gore spent his early life in the western Suburbs of Sydney and attended Westfields Sports High School until moving to [[Queensland]] to live with his father, later attending [[The Southport School]] on [[Queensland|Queensland's]] [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast.]] After completing his year ten certificate Gore left school and began working for one his father's business, Cheoy Lee boats, which his father was importing from Hong Kong during the 1980s. After leaving his father employ Gore established a advertising agency called Take one Creative alternative, with his then partner and long time friend Ross Clarkson a cinematographer. Gore is also a guitarist and his early business career was focused on writing jingles and producing television commercials for a number of national clients including Logan Farm Corn, the then State Bank and others. Gore also produced a number of music videos for bands in the early 1990s. In the late 1990s after his first bankruptcy ( which was annulled ) Gore managed a number of advertising accounts for a small advertising agency on the central coast of [[New South Wales]]. As a result Gore was contracted to help establish the Arnolds Ribs and Pizza Franchise nationally. This resulted in Gore owning and operating several stores himself on the central Coast, in [[Woy Woy, New South Wales|Woy Woy]], [[Gorokan, New South Wales|Gorokan]] and [[Toukley, New South Wales|Toukley.]] It was in late 1996 Gore meet partner Sydney Accountant John Atkinson, and they forged a relationship and established a home loan company called Right Home Loans. After a successful beginning this business later became known as Wright Patton Shakespeare Financial Services Group .Known as WPS, the business grew into one of Australia's largest independent financial Services companies, with more than 400 employees and licence holders Australia wide. WPS established offices in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth]]. Gore, as one of the founders and former owner of the Australian Financial Planning chain \"WPS\", sold his interest in WPS to British Author [[Michael Ashcroft|Lord Michael Ashcroft]] for $160M AUD. The later was introduced to Gore via his then Chairman The Hon [[Shane Stone]], who served as Chairman of WPSFSG for two years before Gore merged his companies with an Ashcroft Entity creating a new company with a focus on purchasing marina developments. This was called International Marina Development and Management Pty Ltd. Stone the served as Chairman of the merged group. This company made a number of aggressive acquisitions in a slowing economy, these included [[Hope Harbour]] Marina, The Townsville Ocean Terminal and Breakwater Marina in Townsville.The sale of WPSFG and other assets to Ashcroft entities was later to become central to a dispute between Gore and Ashcroft and the focus of the Insolvency trustees report to creditors, which claimed, Mayfair Ltd Uk, a company owned and controlled by Ashcroft, owed Gore more than 100M AUD. Gore was also the co-founder of property development company Atkinson Gore Group,. Atkinson Gore group developed predominantly residential properties on the east coast of Australia, in [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]], including the [[Hope Island, Queensland|Hope Island]] Canal adjacent to his late father's [[Sanctuary Cove, Queensland|Sanctuary Cove]] development. Gore was instrumental in establishing the masterplan for the [[Hope Island, Queensland|Hope Island]] Canal development,a development that now houses more than 15000 residents. Gore also developed high rise apartment buildings on The [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], In [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] CBD.

This would later develop into the forming of WPS Racing with Mark Noske being Gores first paid driver to drive for Gore in any form of Motorsport. In 2004 Gore launched his ambitions to form a team in the V8 Supercar series. Gore was approached by then CEO [[Tony Cochrane]] to consider sponsoring the series in some form or another. After much negotiation, Gore's WPSFG become the financial services provider for the series and major sponsor of the V8 Safety Car Program. This also lead Gore to buy Perkins Racing V8 Supercar Licence and entering a team in the V8 Supercar Series beginning in 2004. Announced on the 17th Of February 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crash.net/v8/news/103717/1/craig-gore-announces-new-v8-team|title=Craig Gore announces new V8 team.|date=2004-02-14|website=Crash|language=en|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref> The Team was Named [[WPS Racing]]. Gore also ventured into the open wheeler class of Motorsport after being offered a sponsorship of up and coming Driver Josh Hunt. Gore sponsored Hunt in the 2004 Season of the Atlantic Championship with the view of Hunt Driving that year at the Gold Coast Indy event<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/atlantic/news/lynx-racing-s-josh-hunt-gets-champ-car-australia-ride/149682/|title=Lynx Racing's Josh Hunt gets Champ Car Australia ride|website=www.motorsport.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref>.

The 2004 Supercar season was an up and down season for Gore, it being the first season for his new Team meant they were met with a number of challenges. However they did secure their first race win late in the season when V8 Supercars returned to Tasmania. It was not with out controversy as officials botched up the timing and a stroke of luck left the WPS team out in front. They were able to hold on to the lead and finish first only to be later relegated back to 20th position. An objection was lodged and 7 days later the race was officially awarded to Gore's Team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/v8supercars/news/wps-racing-takes-belated-race-win/173891/|title=WPS Racing takes belated race win|website=www.motorsport.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref>  However the 2004 Sandown race will probably go down in history as one of the worst event for the team. Struggling in poor weather conditions and a lack of driving talent Gores team spent most of the day in mud and it was left to his safety car program to fly the flag for the team after a dismal performance by co-drivers [[Alex Yoong]] and [[Charlie O'Brien (racing driver)|Charlie O'brien.]] However still managing a respectful 16th even though they were 6 laps down. [[2004 Betta Electrical Sandown 500|2004 Betta Electrical 500]].\n\nGore also signed former formula one driver Alex Yoong to drive in the endurance rounds .This was seen more a marketing platform than a serious attempt at winning the endurance rounds. Yoong wasn't well equipped to take on the heavy V8 Supercars and struggled to find form and pace resulting in a huge accident at the end of conrod straight during the [[2004 Bob Jane T-Marts 1000|2004 Bob Jane T Marts 1000]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mount Panorama]] in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] [[New South Wales]]. Gore's assault on the V8 Supercar world would launch into overdrive in the next year with huger sponsorship's of a number of drivers and categories across the planet.  Gore waded into the world wide waters of Motorsport and was a major sponsor and team owner across a huge range of Motorsport categories, from Aussie Racing cars to the Porsche Carrea Cup, BMW open wheel series in the USA as well as the Atlantic Championship, which he subsequently won in 2005 with driver Simon Pagenuad.\n\n==Insolvency and bankruptcy==\nGore was Bankrupted in 1992 after the failure of his advertising agency and the failure of his father's business.

In the late 1990's after his first bankruptcy ( which was annulled ) Gore managed a number of advertising accounts for a small advertising agency on the central coast of [[New South Wales]]. As a result Gore was contracted to help establish the Arnolds Ribs and Pizza Franchise nationally. This resulted in Gore owning and operating several stores himself on the central Coast, in [[Woy Woy, New South Wales|Woy Woy]], [[Gorokan, New South Wales|Gorokan]] and [[Toukley, New South Wales|Toukley.]] It was in late 1996 Gore meet partner Sydney Accountant John Atkinson, and they forged a relationship and established a home loan company called Right Home Loans.

This was called International Marina Development and Management Pty Ltd. Stone the served as Chairman of the merged group. This company made a number of aggressive acquisitions in a slowing economy, these included [[Hope Harbour]] Marina, The Townsville Ocean Terminal and Breakwater Marina in Townsville.The sale of WPSFG and other assets to Ashcroft entities was later to become central to a dispute between Gore and Ashcroft and the focus of the Insolvency trustees report to creditors, which claimed, Mayfair Ltd Uk, a company owned and controlled by Ashcroft, owed Gore more than 100M AUD. Gore was also the co-founder of property development company Atkinson Gore Group,. Atkinson Gore group developed predominantly residential properties on the east coast of Australia, in [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]], including the [[Hope Island, Queensland|Hope Island]] Canal adjacent to his late father's [[Sanctuary Cove, Queensland|Sanctuary Cove]] development.

This would later develop into the forming of WPS Racing with Mark Noske being Gores first paid driver to drive for Gore in any form of Motorsport. In 2004 Gore launched his ambitions to form a team in the V8 Supercar series. Gore was approached by then CEO [[Tony Cochrane]] to consider sponsoring the series in some form or another. After much negotiation, Gore's WPSFG become the financial services provider for the series and major sponsor of the V8 Safety Car Program. This also lead Gore to buy Perkins Racing V8 Supercar Licence and entering a team in the V8 Supercar Series beginning in 2004.

The 2004 Supercar season was an up and down season for Gore, it being the first season for his new Team meant they were met with a number of challenges. However they did secure their first race win late in the season when V8 Supercars returned to Tasmania. It was not with out controversy as officials botched up the timing and a stroke of luck left the WPS team out in front. They were able to hold on to the lead and finish first only to be later relegated back to 20th position. An objection was lodged and 7 days later the race was officially awarded to Gore's Team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/v8supercars/news/wps-racing-takes-belated-race-win/173891/|title=WPS Racing takes belated race win|website=www.motorsport.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref>  However the 2004 Sandown race will probably go down in history as one of the worst event for the team. Struggling in poor weather conditions and a lack of driving talent Gores team spent most of the day in mud and it was left to his safety car program to fly the flag for the team after a dismal performance by co-drivers [[Alex Yoong]] and [[Charlie O'Brien (racing driver)|Charlie O'brien.]] However still managing a respectful 16th even though they were 6 laps down. [[2004 Betta Electrical Sandown 500|2004 Betta Electrical 500]].\n\nGore also signed former formula one driver Alex Yoong to drive in the endurance rounds .This was seen more a marketing platform than a serious attempt at winning the endurance rounds. Yoong wasn't well equipped to take on the heavy V8 Supercars and struggled to find form and pace resulting in a huge accident at the end of conrod straight during the [[2004 Bob Jane T-Marts 1000|2004 Bob Jane T Marts 1000]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mount Panorama]] in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] [[New South Wales]].

Inter-city trains at Central Station are operated by [[Via Rail]] and [[Amtrak]], while commuter rail services are operated by [[R\u00e9seau de transport m\u00e9tropolitain]] (RTM). The station is also connected to the [[Montreal Metro]] subway system.\n\nCentral Station is the second-busiest Via Rail station in Canada, after [[Union Station (Toronto)|Toronto Union Station]]. Its Via station code is MTRL; its Amtrak code is MTR, and its [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] code is YMY.\n\n==History==\nCentral Station opened in 1943, after several years of construction. It stands on the site originally occupied by the terminus of the [[Canadian Northern Railway]]'s Tunnel Terminal, which had originally opened in 1918.\n\n===Canadian National Railways===\n[[File:Fosse du Canadien National Montreal 1930.jpg|thumb|left|The trench of the Canadian National Railway near [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque Boulevard|Dorchester Street]] in 1930.]]\nFollowing the bankruptcy of the [[Grand Trunk Railway]], the [[Government of Canada|Government of the Dominion of Canada]] decided to consolidate the Grand Trunk Railway with the various [[Canadian Government Railways]] to form the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR). The merger left CNR with a somewhat viable patchwork of different networks. \n\nFor much of the first half of the 20th century, CNR found itself in a highly uncomfortable position in Montreal due to the scattering of its terminals. [[Bonaventure Station (1887\u20131952)|Bonaventure Station]] was used for routes heading west and south east, the Tunnel Terminal served routes heading north, Moreau Street Station served eastbound routes, and the [[McGill Street Terminal]] served the interurban streetcars of the [[Montreal and Southern Counties Railway]]. Making matters worse, the various stations were not connected to one another except via long detours. To transfer a train from Bonaventure Station to Tunnel Station it would need to travel to [[Hawkesbury, Ontario]], and to travel from Tunnel Station to Moreau Station it needed to take a detour via [[Rawdon, Quebec|Rawdon]] in the [[Laurentides|Laurentians]].\n\n===Consolidation and construction===\n[[File:Montreal GareCentrale NouvelleLigneThornton.gif|thumb|left|Red shows proposed line to facilitate access to Central Station.]]\nThe solution chosen was to take advantage of the [[Mount Royal Tunnel]] to bring trains from the north and east through the tunnel to a large electrified central station. Trains from the south and west gained access by a new elevated viaduct. Interurban electric trains, however, remained at McGill Street Terminal until the service was abandoned in 1956.\n\nThe new station plan allowed for the development of air-rights, similar to [[New York City]]'s two major stations, [[Grand Central Terminal]] and [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]]. The new Central Station would be situated in the block bounded by [[De la Gaucheti\u00e8re Street]] to the south, [[Mansfield Street, Montreal|Mansfield Street]] to the west, Cathcart Street to the north and [[University Street]] to the east.\n\nCentral Station was designed by [[Archibald and Schofield|John Schofield]], architect-in-chief of CNR. Construction started in 1926, but was halted in 1930 as a result of the [[Great Depression]]. Construction resumed in 1939, the economy having improved. The new station finally opened on July 14, 1943, as the first of a series of large-scale urban redevelopment projects undertaken by CNR and the federal government in [[Downtown Montreal]]. But the Central Station that came out was a more modest structure with 20 tracks, 16 of which had platforms.\n\n===Opening===\n[[File:Canadian National Central Station, Montreal.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard of Central Station. The postcard is undated, but the slogan on the back promoting the sale of war bonds suggests that the card was printed around the time of the station's opening in 1943.]]\nThe opening of a 'central' station was part of a consolidation project undertaken by CNR since [[1929 in Canada|1929]] with the enactment of the ''Canadian National Montreal Terminals Act, 1929'' by [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]]; this saw the closure of former temporary stations operated by CNR predecessors [[Grand Trunk Railway|Grand Trunk]] ([[Bonaventure Station (1887\u20131952)|Bonaventure Station]]) and [[Canadian Northern Railway|Canadian Northern]].\n\n===Consolidation of CN and CP intercity trains===\nCentral Station was an important passenger station for CN trains from 1943 until the creation of [[Via Rail]] in [[1978 in Canada|1978]]. Following Via's full absorption of [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]'s passenger trains in [[1978 in Canada|1978]], intercity rail traffic from [[Windsor Station (Montreal)|Windsor Station]] was slowly redirected to Central Station.  The final Via trains switched from Windsor Station to Central Station were the [[Gare du Palais|Quebec City]] trains that operated by way of [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] (April 29, 1984).  Amtrak's ''[[Adirondack (Amtrak)|Adirondack]]'' was switched to Central Station on January 12, 1986.\n\n===Modifications to the station===\n[[File:CNR Electric LastElectricLocomotive 1995-07-06.jpg|thumb|On June 2, 1995, the last commuter train hauled by venerable CN Z-1-a electric Bo-Bo #6710 has arrived in Central Station and pauses with the train crew. This locomotive was the same that had inaugurated the [[Mount Royal Tunnel]], 77 years earlier.]]\nAt Central Station's opening, tracks (7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12) of the Tunnel Station were used only by trains heading north through the tunnel, and they did not continue south of the station. These tracks were finally connected to the south when the old Tunnel Station was demolished as well as the warehouse located south of De la Gaucheti\u00e8re Street and east of Inspector Street (now Mansfield Street). This also allowed for the construction of the new headquarters of CNR as well as [[Place Bonaventure]]. This division is once again in effect following the rebuilding of the [[Deux-Montagnes line]]. These tracks are now part of the Two Mountains Subdivision, extending south for a distance of about 1600 metres. Under [[Overhead lines|catenary]] wires, they serve as parking for trains on the Deux-Montagnes line during the day. Since the reopening of the [[Mont-Saint-Hilaire line]], they are also used to park trains from this line.\n\nTracks 6\u201316 lead to the tunnel to the north, and lanes 4, 5 and tracks 16 to 23 are in a cul-de-sac to the north (track 16 is provided with a switch just north of the stairs). Tracks 13 to 15 are never used in the northbound direction because of the lack of catenary wires.\n\nOne platform (23) is inaccessible to the main concourse, and serves instead as parking for the company cars belonging to upper-level management.\n\nUpon entry into service of the [[UAC TurboTrain]], three tracks (4, 5, 6) were arranged on the west side of the station for a servicing and maintenance facility located there. The workshop, called \"Turbo Bay\", is still used to maintain light [[commuter rail|commuter trains]] as well as the private cars belonging to CN's senior management who use the station. The tracks in the workshop are protected by derails.\n\nAround 1980, the catenary wire was removed from tracks 13, 14, 15 and 16, to allow dome train cars to enter the station.\n\nIn 1994\u20131995, the complete reconstruction of the commuter rail Deux-Montagnes Line resulted in tracks 7\u201312 being re-electrified at [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]]. The original 3000-volt DC catenary was removed from the other tracks.\n\nThe platforms of tracks 7 and 8 are now inaccessible from the station, the entrance having been sealed to allow for the development of commercial space, and the tracks now used as parking for trains waiting to be repaired in the \"Turbo Bay\".\n\n===Bombing===\nOn September 3, 1984, a pipe bomb exploded inside a Central Station locker, killing 3 people and injuring 30 more. The bomb was alleged to have been set by retired American armed forces officer [[Thomas Bernard Brigham]], who claimed to have been protesting [[Pope John Paul II]]'s visit to Canada.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NhgiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nqUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2790%2C8267|title=War vet held in bombing|date=4 September 1984|last1=Curran|first1=Peggy|last2=Collister|first2=Eddie|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]|access-date=12 April 2016|via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nWith the design being overseen by CNR's architect-in-chief John Schofield (1883\u20131971),<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian National Railways Central Station|url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16142|website=Canada's Historic Places|accessdate=13 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112051801/http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16142|archivedate=12 January 2016}}</ref> the architecture of Central Station is modern; it is a mixture of [[Art Deco]] and the [[international style (architecture)|international style]]. Its large concourse, designed by [[John Campbell Merrett]] (1909\u20131998), is illuminated by large windows. Originally, the concourse was cluttered by various ticket counters and kiosks, but, over time, they were pushed to the extremities of the room, which left much more space for the passing crowds.\n\nThe 14 underground tracks are accessible by seven stairwells, five of which are equipped with [[escalator]]s.\n\nThe east and west interior walls of the station feature two large [[bas-relief]]s depicting Canadian life, arts and industry, designed by [[Charles Comfort]] and executed by Sebastiano Aiello.<ref>[http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16142 \"Canadian National Railway Grand Central Station\", ''Canada's Historic Places] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112051801/http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16142 |date=2016-01-12 }}</ref> Included in the bas relief are a few of the lyrics of [[O Canada]], which still was not the national anthem when the station was built. The lyrics are in French on the east side of the station and in English on the west side. Canadian artist [[Fritz Brandtner]] created the three large chiselled stone reliefs depicting Mercury, Apollo and Poseidon on the station's north exterior wall. The representations of Mercury and Poseidon measure approximately 2,5m by 4,5m. Apollo is larger but visual access is very limited. These were obscured by the 1958 construction of the neighbouring Queen Elizabeth Hotel. It is disputed whether Comfort or Brandtner created the thematic stone medallions depicting water, land and air transportation on the station's west, south and east exterior walls. Stylistically, however, the bas-relief medallions bear a strong resemblance to the frieze by Charles Comfort created for the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] building in 1937.\n\n==Railway operations==\n[[File:Image-Central train station, west corner art, Montreal.JPG|thumb|A sample of the [[bas-relief]] artwork that adorns the concourse's walls.]]\nBecause of its underground urban location, the railway station quickly imposed operational constraints on CNR.\n\nTo avoid smoke in the vicinity of the station, the first trains were powered by electric locomotives. The change of traction took place at Bridge Street, {{convert|3|km|mi}} south for trains serving the south-east, at [[Turcot Yards]], {{convert|6|km|mi}} west for trains serving the west, Val Royal, {{convert|14|km|mi}} north for trains running northwest of the junction and {{convert|9|km|mi}} north for trains serving the northeast. A fleet of 14 electric locomotives were used for this work.\n\nAn elaborate system of signals allowed staff to track the status of the various trains. At the station, as soon as the train was ready to receive passengers, the conductor inserted the key switch in a special switch indicating to staff at the station (ticket checkers) that the train was ready. The movement director at Wellington was also advised via a series of lights that the train was receiving passengers, which then allowed him to establish the route out of the station.\n\nAccess to the platforms is controlled by ticket examiners who verify each passenger's ticket. This configuration limits access uniquely to passengers.  At the time of departure, after all passengers had descended, the ticket checker would press a button that notified the conductor, through a green light on the platform, that the train could leave. The movement director in Wellington was also advised of the departure by a special light. The final decision of departure was the responsibility of the conductor, until conductors were replaced by a second engineer in the 1990s.\n\n==Urban development==\n[[File:Front of the Gare Centrale du CN, CN Central Station.jpg|thumb|The parking garage bordering [[de La Gaucheti\u00e8re Street]].]]\nOver the years, the empty space around Central Station has gradually developed to the point where the station building itself is hardly visible from the outside.\n\nIn 1948, [[ICAO]] built its headquarters over the northeast portion of the station along University Street south of Dorchester Street. Then in 1959, the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] was built on the western portion, on the corner of Dorchester and Mansfield, which was the first of many major redevelopments in the area.\n\nIn 1960, the former Tunnel Station building was demolished to allow for the construction of the new head-office of CNR, and soon after, a large parking garage was built over the southern part of the station. The [[Terminal Tower (Montreal)|Terminal Tower]] of 1966 completely hid the station from Dorchester Boulevard.\n\nBelmont Street, east of the station was extended over the station itself to Mansfield Street. On Belmont is the only visible portion of the exterior of the station, the rest having been attached to the various buildings built over the years.\n\nThe north side of Dorchester (now Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque Boulevard) then saw the construction of the complex of [[Place Ville-Marie]], which now includes four skyscrapers whose highest was 45 floors and an underground shopping mall, which was the beginning of the [[Underground City, Montreal|Underground City]].\n\nIn the mid 1960s, [[Place Bonaventure]] was built over the tracks, south of de La Gaucheti\u00e8re Street.\n\nIn 1966, Central Station and Place Bonaventure were connected underground by the new [[Bonaventure (Montreal Metro)|Bonaventure Metro station]], named in honour of the demolished Bonaventure railway station.\n\nAll of these buildings underwent major renovations over the next 30 years.\n\n==Connecting facilities==\n[[Image:Halles, Central train station, Montreal 2006-01-09.JPG|thumb|right|''Les Halles de la gare'' shopping and restaurant complex.]]\nCentral Station is located adjacent to [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] Headquarters and is an important link in the [[underground city (Montreal)|underground city]], with tunnels to [[Place Ville-Marie]], [[Place Bonaventure]], the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]], [[1000 de La Gaucheti\u00e8re]] and the [[Bonaventure (Montreal Metro)|Bonaventure Metro station]].\n\nIt also contains two [[parking garage|parking facilities]], one of which is a multi-level facility that is located above the station.\n\n===Les Halles de la Gare===\nCentral Station has gradually grown to include ''Les Halles de la Gare'', a shopping and [[Food court|restaurant complex]]. Real estate pressures have meant that the shopping area would be expanded several times.\n\nWhile the old ICAO building was undergoing renovations in 1981, (after the relocation of ICAO to [[Sherbrooke Street]]), a railway-themed shopping area expanded on the north side of the station.  This section was completely destroyed in 1995 during the restoration of the Deux-Montagnes Line, and was replaced by the present Les Halles de la Gare complex.\n\n==U.S. preclearance==\nIn May 2012, U.S. Senators [[Charles Schumer]], [[Kirsten Gillibrand]], [[Patrick Leahy]], and [[Bernie Sanders]] sent a letter to President [[Barack Obama]] urging him to fastrack the approval of a [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|U.S. Customs]] [[United States border preclearance|preclearance]] facility at the station that will benefit U.S. bound travelers on the ''[[Adirondack (train)|Adirondack]]'' from having to stop at the [[Rouses Point (Amtrak station)|railway station]] located in [[Rouses Point, New York|Rouses Point]], [[New York (state)|New York]] for immigration and customs checks whenever they cross the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]].

Inter-city trains at Central Station are operated by [[Via Rail]] and [[Amtrak]], while commuter rail services are operated by [[R\u00e9seau de transport m\u00e9tropolitain]] (RTM). The station is also connected to the [[Montreal Metro]] subway system.\n\nCentral Station is the second-busiest Via Rail station in Canada, after [[Union Station (Toronto)|Toronto Union Station]]. Its Via station code is MTRL; its Amtrak code is MTR, and its [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] code is YMY.\n\n==History==\nCentral Station opened in 1943, after several years of construction. It stands on the site originally occupied by the terminus of the [[Canadian Northern Railway]]'s Tunnel Terminal, which had originally opened in 1918.\n\n===Canadian National Railways===\n[[File:Fosse du Canadien National Montreal 1930.jpg|thumb|left|The trench of the Canadian National Railway near [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque Boulevard|Dorchester Street]] in 1930.]]\nFollowing the bankruptcy of the [[Grand Trunk Railway]], the [[Government of Canada|Government of the Dominion of Canada]] decided to consolidate the Grand Trunk Railway with the various [[Canadian Government Railways]] to form the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR). The merger left CNR with a somewhat viable patchwork of different networks. \n\nFor much of the first half of the 20th century, CNR found itself in a highly uncomfortable position in Montreal due to the scattering of its terminals. [[Bonaventure Station (1887\u20131952)|Bonaventure Station]] was used for routes heading west and south east, the Tunnel Terminal served routes heading north, Moreau Street Station served eastbound routes, and the [[McGill Street Terminal]] served the interurban streetcars of the [[Montreal and Southern Counties Railway]]. Making matters worse, the various stations were not connected to one another except via long detours. To transfer a train from Bonaventure Station to Tunnel Station it would need to travel to [[Hawkesbury, Ontario]], and to travel from Tunnel Station to Moreau Station it needed to take a detour via [[Rawdon, Quebec|Rawdon]] in the [[Laurentides|Laurentians]].\n\n===Consolidation and construction===\n[[File:Montreal GareCentrale NouvelleLigneThornton.gif|thumb|left|Red shows proposed line to facilitate access to Central Station.]]\nThe solution chosen was to take advantage of the [[Mount Royal Tunnel]] to bring trains from the north and east through the tunnel to a large electrified central station. Trains from the south and west gained access by a new elevated viaduct. Interurban electric trains, however, remained at McGill Street Terminal until the service was abandoned in 1956.\n\nThe new station plan allowed for the development of air-rights, similar to [[New York City]]'s two major stations, [[Grand Central Terminal]] and [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]]. The new Central Station would be situated in the block bounded by [[De la Gaucheti\u00e8re Street]] to the south, [[Mansfield Street, Montreal|Mansfield Street]] to the west, Cathcart Street to the north and [[University Street]] to the east.\n\nCentral Station was designed by [[Archibald and Schofield|John Schofield]], architect-in-chief of CNR. Construction started in 1926, but was halted in 1930 as a result of the [[Great Depression]]. Construction resumed in 1939, the economy having improved. The new station finally opened on July 14, 1943, as the first of a series of large-scale urban redevelopment projects undertaken by CNR and the federal government in [[Downtown Montreal]]. But the Central Station that came out was a more modest structure with 20 tracks, 16 of which had platforms.\n\n===Opening===\n[[File:Canadian National Central Station, Montreal.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard of Central Station. The postcard is undated, but the slogan on the back promoting the sale of war bonds suggests that the card was printed around the time of the station's opening in 1943.]]\nThe opening of a 'central' station was part of a consolidation project undertaken by CNR since [[1929 in Canada|1929]] with the enactment of the ''Canadian National Montreal Terminals Act, 1929'' by [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]]; this saw the closure of former temporary stations operated by CNR predecessors [[Grand Trunk Railway|Grand Trunk]] ([[Bonaventure Station (1887\u20131952)|Bonaventure Station]]) and [[Canadian Northern Railway|Canadian Northern]].\n\n===Consolidation of CN and CP intercity trains===\nCentral Station was an important passenger station for CN trains from 1943 until the creation of [[Via Rail]] in [[1978 in Canada|1978]]. Following Via's full absorption of [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]'s passenger trains in [[1978 in Canada|1978]], intercity rail traffic from [[Windsor Station (Montreal)|Windsor Station]] was slowly redirected to Central Station.  The final Via trains switched from Windsor Station to Central Station were the [[Gare du Palais|Quebec City]] trains that operated by way of [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] (April 29, 1984).  Amtrak's ''[[Adirondack (Amtrak)|Adirondack]]'' was switched to Central Station on January 12, 1986.\n\n===Modifications to the station===\n[[File:CNR Electric LastElectricLocomotive 1995-07-06.jpg|thumb|On June 2, 1995, the last commuter train hauled by venerable CN Z-1-a electric Bo-Bo #6710 has arrived in Central Station and pauses with the train crew. This locomotive was the same that had inaugurated the [[Mount Royal Tunnel]], 77 years earlier.]]\nAt Central Station's opening, tracks (7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12) of the Tunnel Station were used only by trains heading north through the tunnel, and they did not continue south of the station. These tracks were finally connected to the south when the old Tunnel Station was demolished as well as the warehouse located south of De la Gaucheti\u00e8re Street and east of Inspector Street (now Mansfield Street). This also allowed for the construction of the new headquarters of CNR as well as [[Place Bonaventure]]. This division is once again in effect following the rebuilding of the [[Deux-Montagnes line]]. These tracks are now part of the Two Mountains Subdivision, extending south for a distance of about 1600 metres. Under [[Overhead lines|catenary]] wires, they serve as parking for trains on the Deux-Montagnes line during the day. Since the reopening of the [[Mont-Saint-Hilaire line]], they are also used to park trains from this line.\n\nTracks 6\u201316 lead to the tunnel to the north, and lanes 4, 5 and tracks 16 to 23 are in a cul-de-sac to the north (track 16 is provided with a switch just north of the stairs). Tracks 13 to 15 are never used in the northbound direction because of the lack of catenary wires.\n\nOne platform (23) is inaccessible to the main concourse, and serves instead as parking for the company cars belonging to upper-level management.\n\nUpon entry into service of the [[UAC TurboTrain]], three tracks (4, 5, 6) were arranged on the west side of the station for a servicing and maintenance facility located there. The workshop, called \"Turbo Bay\", is still used to maintain light [[commuter rail|commuter trains]] as well as the private cars belonging to CN's senior management who use the station. The tracks in the workshop are protected by derails.\n\nAround 1980, the catenary wire was removed from tracks 13, 14, 15 and 16, to allow dome train cars to enter the station.\n\nIn 1994\u20131995, the complete reconstruction of the commuter rail Deux-Montagnes Line resulted in tracks 7\u201312 being re-electrified at [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]]. The original 3000-volt DC catenary was removed from the other tracks.\n\nThe platforms of tracks 7 and 8 are now inaccessible from the station, the entrance having been sealed to allow for the development of commercial space, and the tracks now used as parking for trains waiting to be repaired in the \"Turbo Bay\".\n\n===Bombing===\nOn September 3, 1984, a pipe bomb exploded inside a Central Station locker, killing 3 people and injuring 30 more. The bomb was alleged to have been set by retired American armed forces officer [[Thomas Bernard Brigham]], who claimed to have been protesting [[Pope John Paul II]]'s visit to Canada.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NhgiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nqUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2790%2C8267|title=War vet held in bombing|date=4 September 1984|last1=Curran|first1=Peggy|last2=Collister|first2=Eddie|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]|access-date=12 April 2016|via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nWith the design being overseen by CNR's architect-in-chief John Schofield (1883-1971),<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian National Railways Central Station|url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16142|website=Canada's Historic Places|accessdate=13 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112051801/http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16142|archivedate=12 January 2016}}</ref> the architecture of Central Station is modern; it is a mixture of [[Art Deco]] and the [[international style (architecture)|international style]]. Its large concourse, designed by [[John Campbell Merrett]] (1909-1998), is illuminated by large windows. Originally, the concourse was cluttered by various ticket counters and kiosks, but, over time, they were pushed to the extremities of the room, which left much more space for the passing crowds.\n\nThe 14 underground tracks are accessible by seven stairwells, five of which are equipped with [[escalator]]s.\n\nThe east and west interior walls of the station feature two large [[bas-relief]]s depicting Canadian life, arts and industry, designed by [[Charles Comfort]] and executed by Sebastiano Aiello.<ref>[http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16142 \"Canadian National Railway Grand Central Station\", ''Canada's Historic Places] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112051801/http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16142 |date=2016-01-12 }}</ref> Included in the bas relief are a few of the lyrics of [[O Canada]], which still was not the national anthem when the station was built. The lyrics are in French on the east side of the station and in English on the west side. Canadian artist [[Fritz Brandtner]] created the three large chiselled stone reliefs depicting Mercury, Apollo and Poseidon on the station's north exterior wall. The representations of Mercury and Poseidon measure approximately 2,5m by 4,5m. Apollo is larger but visual access is very limited. These were obscured by the 1958 construction of the neighbouring Queen Elizabeth Hotel. It is disputed whether Comfort or Brandtner created the thematic stone medallions depicting water, land and air transportation on the station's west, south and east exterior walls. Stylistically, however, the bas-relief medallions bear a strong resemblance to the frieze by Charles Comfort created for the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] building in 1937.\n\n==Railway operations==\n[[File:Image-Central train station, west corner art, Montreal.JPG|thumb|A sample of the [[bas-relief]] artwork that adorns the concourse's walls.]]\nBecause of its underground urban location, the railway station quickly imposed operational constraints on CNR.\n\nTo avoid smoke in the vicinity of the station, the first trains were powered by electric locomotives. The change of traction took place at Bridge Street, {{convert|3|km|mi}} south for trains serving the south-east, at [[Turcot Yards]], {{convert|6|km|mi}} west for trains serving the west, Val Royal, {{convert|14|km|mi}} north for trains running northwest of the junction and {{convert|9|km|mi}} north for trains serving the northeast. A fleet of 14 electric locomotives were used for this work.\n\nAn elaborate system of signals allowed staff to track the status of the various trains. At the station, as soon as the train was ready to receive passengers, the conductor inserted the key switch in a special switch indicating to staff at the station (ticket checkers) that the train was ready. The movement director at Wellington was also advised via a series of lights that the train was receiving passengers, which then allowed him to establish the route out of the station.\n\nAccess to the platforms is controlled by ticket examiners who verify each passenger's ticket. This configuration limits access uniquely to passengers.  At the time of departure, after all passengers had descended, the ticket checker would press a button that notified the conductor, through a green light on the platform, that the train could leave. The movement director in Wellington was also advised of the departure by a special light. The final decision of departure was the responsibility of the conductor, until conductors were replaced by a second engineer in the 1990s.\n\n==Urban development==\n[[File:Front of the Gare Centrale du CN, CN Central Station.jpg|thumb|The parking garage bordering [[de La Gaucheti\u00e8re Street]].]]\nOver the years, the empty space around Central Station has gradually developed to the point where the station building itself is hardly visible from the outside.\n\nIn 1948, [[ICAO]] built its headquarters over the northeast portion of the station along University Street south of Dorchester Street. Then in 1959, the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] was built on the western portion, on the corner of Dorchester and Mansfield, which was the first of many major redevelopments in the area.\n\nIn 1960, the former Tunnel Station building was demolished to allow for the construction of the new head-office of CNR, and soon after, a large parking garage was built over the southern part of the station. The [[Terminal Tower (Montreal)|Terminal Tower]] of 1966 completely hid the station from Dorchester Boulevard.\n\nBelmont Street, east of the station was extended over the station itself to Mansfield Street. On Belmont is the only visible portion of the exterior of the station, the rest having been attached to the various buildings built over the years.\n\nThe north side of Dorchester (now Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque Boulevard) then saw the construction of the complex of [[Place Ville-Marie]], which now includes four skyscrapers whose highest was 45 floors and an underground shopping mall, which was the beginning of the [[Underground City, Montreal|Underground City]].\n\nIn the mid 1960s, [[Place Bonaventure]] was built over the tracks, south of de La Gaucheti\u00e8re Street.\n\nIn 1966, Central Station and Place Bonaventure were connected underground by the new [[Bonaventure (Montreal Metro)|Bonaventure Metro station]], named in honour of the demolished Bonaventure railway station.\n\nAll of these buildings underwent major renovations over the next 30 years.\n\n==Connecting facilities==\n[[Image:Halles, Central train station, Montreal 2006-01-09.JPG|thumb|right|''Les Halles de la gare'' shopping and restaurant complex.]]\nCentral Station is located adjacent to [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] Headquarters and is an important link in the [[underground city (Montreal)|underground city]], with tunnels to [[Place Ville-Marie]], [[Place Bonaventure]], the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]], [[1000 de La Gaucheti\u00e8re]] and the [[Bonaventure (Montreal Metro)|Bonaventure Metro station]].\n\nIt also contains two [[parking garage|parking facilities]], one of which is a multi-level facility that is located above the station.\n\n===Les Halles de la Gare===\nCentral Station has gradually grown to include ''Les Halles de la Gare'', a shopping and [[Food court|restaurant complex]]. Real estate pressures have meant that the shopping area would be expanded several times.\n\nWhile the old ICAO building was undergoing renovations in 1981, (after the relocation of ICAO to [[Sherbrooke Street]]), a railway-themed shopping area expanded on the north side of the station.  This section was completely destroyed in 1995 during the restoration of the Deux-Montagnes Line, and was replaced by the present Les Halles de la Gare complex.\n\n==U.S. preclearance==\nIn May 2012, U.S. Senators [[Charles Schumer]], [[Kirsten Gillibrand]], [[Patrick Leahy]], and [[Bernie Sanders]] sent a letter to President [[Barack Obama]] urging him to fastrack the approval of a [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|U.S. Customs]] [[United States border preclearance|preclearance]] facility at the station that will benefit U.S. bound travelers on the ''[[Adirondack (train)|Adirondack]]'' from having to stop at the [[Rouses Point (Amtrak station)|railway station]] located in [[Rouses Point, New York|Rouses Point]], [[New York (state)|New York]] for immigration and customs checks whenever they cross the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]]. Under the arrangement, the stop in [[Saint-Lambert railway station|Saint-Lambert]] would be removed.<ref name=\"RailwayAge\">{{cite

The series was written by Atkinson and [[Richard Curtis]], and produced by [[Griff Rhys Jones]].<ref name=\"Atkinson people\">\"[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/31/tvandradio Pick of the Day]\", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Television ===\nAfter university, Atkinson did a one-off pilot for [[London Weekend Television]] in 1979 called ''[[Canned Laughter (sitcom)|Canned Laughter]]''. Atkinson then went on to do ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' for the [[BBC]], produced by his friend [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]. He featured in the show with [[Pamela Stephenson]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Mel Smith]], and was one of the main sketch writers.\n\nThe success of ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' led to him taking the lead role of [[Edmund Blackadder]] in ''[[Blackadder]]''. The first series ''[[The Black Adder]]'' (1983), set in medieval period, Atkinson co-wrote with [[Richard Curtis]]. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, written by Curtis and [[Ben Elton]]. ''[[Blackadder II]]'' (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the [[Elizabethan era]]. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (1987), set in the [[Regency era]], and ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' (1989), set in World War I. The ''Blackadder'' series became one of the most successful of all [[BBC]] situation comedies, spawning television specials including ''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]'' (1988), ''[[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years]]'' (1988), and later ''[[Blackadder: Back & Forth]]'' (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium. The final scene of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" (when Blackadder and his men go \"over the top\" and charge into No-Man's-Land) has been described as \"bold and highly poignant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackaddergoesforth/|title=BBC&nbsp;\u2014 Comedy&nbsp;\u2014 Blackadder Goes Forth}}</ref> Possessing an [[acerbic wit]] and armed with numerous quick put-downs (which are often wasted on those at whom they are directed), in a 2001 [[Channel 4]] poll Edmund Blackadder was ranked third (behind [[Homer Simpson]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and [[Basil Fawlty]] from ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'') on their list of the [[100 Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest TV Characters]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531160558/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archivedate=31 May 2009 |title=100 Greatest TV Characters |accessdate=26 May 2019 |publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/ITVProgs/2001/05/05/Y22090001/ |title=100 Greatest ...

Atkinson states, \u201cI remember watching them avidly as students at university.\u201d<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He continued to be influenced by the work of [[John Cleese]] following his Monty Python days, regarding Cleese as being \u201ca major, major inspiration\u201d, adding, \u201cI think that he and I are quite different in our style and our approach, but certainly it was comedy I liked to watch.

It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and [[Richard Curtis]], and produced by [[Griff Rhys Jones]].<ref name=\"Atkinson people\">\"[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/31/tvandradio Pick of the Day]\", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Television ===\nAfter university, Atkinson did a one-off pilot for [[London Weekend Television]] in 1979 called ''[[Canned Laughter (sitcom)|Canned Laughter]]''. Atkinson then went on to do ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' for the [[BBC]], produced by his friend [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]. He featured in the show with [[Pamela Stephenson]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Mel Smith]], and was one of the main sketch writers.\n\nThe success of ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' led to him taking the lead role of [[Edmund Blackadder]] in ''[[Blackadder]]''. The first series ''[[The Black Adder]]'' (1983), set in medieval period, Atkinson co-wrote with [[Richard Curtis]]. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, written by Curtis and [[Ben Elton]]. ''[[Blackadder II]]'' (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the [[Elizabethan era]]. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (1987), set in the [[Regency era]], and ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' (1989), set in World War I. The ''Blackadder'' series became one of the most successful of all [[BBC]] situation comedies, spawning television specials including ''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]'' (1988), ''[[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years]]'' (1988), and later ''[[Blackadder: Back & Forth]]'' (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium. The final scene of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" (when Blackadder and his men go \"over the top\" and charge into No-Man's-Land) has been described as \"bold and highly poignant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackaddergoesforth/|title=BBC&nbsp;\u2014 Comedy&nbsp;\u2014 Blackadder Goes Forth}}</ref> Possessing an [[acerbic wit]] and armed with numerous quick put-downs (which are often wasted on those at whom they are directed), in a 2001 [[Channel 4]] poll Edmund Blackadder was ranked third (behind [[Homer Simpson]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and [[Basil Fawlty]] from ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'') on their list of the [[100 Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest TV Characters]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531160558/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archivedate=31 May 2009 |title=100 Greatest TV Characters |accessdate=26 May 2019 |publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/ITVProgs/2001/05/05/Y22090001/ |title=100 Greatest ...

He also sang the song \u201c[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]\u201d in ''The Lion King''. Atkinson continued to appear in supporting roles in comedies, including ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]'' (2001), ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' (2002), jewellery salesman Rufus in another Richard Curtis British-set romantic comedy, ''[[Love Actually]]'' (2003), and the crime comedy ''[[Keeping Mum]]'' (2005), which also starred [[Kristin Scott Thomas]], [[Maggie Smith]], and [[Patrick Swayze]].\n\nIn addition to his supporting roles, Atkinson has also had success as a leading man.

Atkinson often plays authority figures (especially priests or vicars) speaking absurd lines with a completely [[deadpan]] delivery.\n\nOne of his better-known [[comedic device|comic devices]] is over-articulation of the \"B\" sound, such as his pronunciation of \"[[Bob (Blackadder character)|Bob]]\" in the ''[[Blackadder II]]'' episode \"[[Bells (Blackadder)|Bells]]\". Atkinson suffers from a [[Stuttering|stammer]],<ref>{{cite news|title=10 Questions for Rowan Atkinson|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1655712,00.html|access-date=1 June 2011|work=Time|date=23 August 2007}}</ref> and the over-articulation is a technique to overcome problematic consonants.\n\nAtkinson's often visually based style, which has been compared to that of [[Buster Keaton]],<ref name=\"Museum.tv\" /> sets him apart from most modern television and film comics, who rely heavily on dialogue, as well as stand-up comedy which is mostly based on monologues. This talent for visual comedy has led to Atkinson being called \"the man with the rubber face\"; comedic reference was made to this in an episode of ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (\"[[Sense and Senility]]\"), in which [[Baldrick]] ([[Tony Robinson]]) refers to his master, [[Edmund Blackadder|Mr. E. Blackadder]], as a \"lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard\".\n\n==Influences==\n\nAtkinson's early comedy influences were the sketch comedy troupe ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', made up of [[Peter Cook]], [[Dudley Moore]], [[Jonathan Miller]] and [[Alan Bennett]], major figures of the 1960s British [[satire boom]], and then [[Monty Python]]. Atkinson states, \u201cI remember watching them avidly as students at university.\u201d<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He continued to be influenced by the work of [[John Cleese]] following his Monty Python days, regarding Cleese as being \u201ca major, major inspiration\u201d, adding, \u201cI think that he and I are quite different in our style and our approach, but certainly it was comedy I liked to watch. He was very physical. Yes, very physical and very angry.\u201d<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He was also influenced by [[Peter Sellers]], whose characters [[Hrundi Bakshi]] from ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'' (1968) and [[Inspector Clouseau]] from ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' films influenced Atkinson's characters Mr. Bean and Johnny English.<ref>{{cite news |title=Want funny?
