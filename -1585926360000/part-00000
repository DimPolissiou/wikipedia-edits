Its original name was UDMC Seafood Centre, which was later changed in 2000 to its current name. Popularised for housing several major local seafood restaurants, the seafood centre serves local favourites such as [[chilli crab]], [[black pepper crab]] and [[mee goreng]]. In 2005, the Seafood Centre was upgraded to give it a modernised look, and better facilities. Many of the features were revamped, and a number of old tenants vacated for new tenants to take their place.\n\nPlans for the seafood centre were first announced in July 1977, with five seafood restaurants from Upper East Coast Road.<ref name=\":1\"/> The owners of the restaurants were initially unhappy with the offer to move, citing reduced seating and patronage at the new site.<ref>{{cite news |title=Move to E.

For these restaurants, the business was generally better than at their old premises, with restaurant owners noting increased takings, and their patrons were also satisfied with the new location. However, there was also much unhappiness among restaurant owners and customers over the inconvenience of the seafood centre.<ref name=\":4\"/> In 1990, renovations were carried out at the restaurants. That same year, all the restaurants at the centre were fined, while two, Golden Lagoon and Jumbo, were suspended for two weeks for violations of health regulations, such as poor hygiene practices.

However, by 2015, customer numbers had decreased considerably, with those at Red House Seafood falling by 35 percent in the previous two years. In March 2015, Red House Seafood closed, with a landscaped lawn taking its place, and with their leases having expired, two other restaurants, No Signboard Seafood and Fisherman's Village, also closed.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n===Marine Cove===\n[[File:Marine Cove, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|250px|right|{{Center|Marine Cove}}]]\nMarine Cove (formerly known as the East Coast Recreation Centre), is a building complex in Area&nbsp;C at East Coast Park where in the past, many [[caf\u00e9]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s were located.

He did this to facilitate the importation of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, it was in a poor state, with ''The Straits Times'' noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1&nbsp;million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|{{Center|View of Bedok Jetty}} {{Center|from East Coast Park}}]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in the East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space.

Coast Park, they are told |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19770709-1.2.57 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=9 July 1977 |accessdate=12 October 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=11 }}</ref> In response, the Ministry of National Development claimed that with the offer, they were helping them by allowing them to continue business permanently, since the restaurants were then operating on a temporary basis.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ministry on that offer to seafood restaurants |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19770715-1.2.92 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=15 July 1977 |accessdate=12 October 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=18 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1980, revised plans for the seafood centre were announced, with room for eight seafood restaurants located near the lagoon.<ref>{{cite news |title=New seafood centre |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19800901-1.2.6 |work=New Nation |location=Singapore |date=1 September 1980 |accessdate=12 October 2019 |page=2 }}</ref> Eventually, the seafood centre, with space for eight restaurants, was constructed near the swimming lagoon due to frequent complaints by residents in the Upper East Coast Road area over illegal parking by restaurant customers, at a cost of $5&nbsp;million. Tenders for the restaurants were called in February 1985.<ref>{{cite news |title=New $5.4 m haunt for seafood lovers |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19850223-1.2.24.16 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1985 |accessdate=1 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=9 }}</ref>\n\nAfter renovations, the first six restaurants at the seafood centre opened for business in October 1985. For these restaurants, the business was generally better than at their old premises, with restaurant owners noting increased takings, and their patrons were also satisfied with the new location. However, there was also much unhappiness among restaurant owners and customers over the inconvenience of the seafood centre.<ref name=\":4\"/> In 1990, renovations were carried out at the restaurants. That same year, all the restaurants at the centre were fined, while two, Golden Lagoon and Jumbo, were suspended for two weeks for violations of health regulations, such as poor hygiene practices. Nevertheless, business did not seem to be affected, with a ''Straits Times'' reporter noting that they still drew large crowds in the evening.<ref name=\":9\"/>\n\nThrough the rest of the 1980s and 1990s, the restaurants at the centre generally did well, and many tourists patronised them. However, by 2015, customer numbers had decreased considerably, with those at Red House Seafood falling by 35 percent in the previous two years. In March 2015, Red House Seafood closed, with a landscaped lawn taking its place, and with their leases having expired, two other restaurants, No Signboard Seafood and Fisherman's Village, also closed.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n===Marine Cove===\n[[File:Marine Cove, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|250px|right|{{Center|Marine Cove}}]]\nMarine Cove (formerly known as the East Coast Recreation Centre), is a building complex in Area&nbsp;C at East Coast Park where in the past, many [[caf\u00e9]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s were located. It also used to have a [[bowling alley]] and a [[billiards]] saloon.\n\nConstruction of the East Coast Recreation Centre began in April 1980, and it was completed in early 1982 at a cost of $3.5&nbsp;million. Touted by its developer to have something for each member of the family, <ref>{{cite news |title=East Coast centre for recreation coming up |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19800119-1.2.54 |work=Business Times |location=Singapore |date=19 January 1980 |accessdate=15 October 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=12 }}</ref> it featured a computer library offering computer classes, a music school, an amusement room with video games, restaurants and sports facilities.<ref name=\":3\"/> Because of insufficient available parking spaces, an additional car park was initially opened on a grass verge; a permanent car park was eventually built.<ref>{{cite news |title=Where the grass is greener |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19821104-1.2.48 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=4 November 1982 |accessdate=15 October 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, as part of the new E-zone theme park, the complex underwent an eight-month renovation in 1996. Among the changes were the construction of a room and a building to house [[Sega]] gaming machines. With the renovation, all tenants but [[McDonalds]] moved out.<ref name=\":A\"/>\n\nThe location was sold to Rock Productions, [[New Creation Church]]'s business arm, in 2002, and it was subsequently renamed Marine Cove. With the land handed back to NParks in 2011, the area was closed for redevelopment the following year.<ref name=\":5\"/> The new Marine Cove featuring a greater variety of dining options and a {{cvt|3,500|m2}} children's playground at the redeveloped facility, reopened on 28&nbsp;June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marine Cove at East Coast Park to reopen end-June|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/marine-cove-at-east-coast/2900694.html}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|title = 2 new developments to offer visitors more recreational options at East Coast park|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/2-new-developments-to-offer-visitors-more-recreational-options-at-east-coast|website = The Straits Times|access-date = 13 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716011727/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/2-new-developments-to-offer-visitors-more-recreational-options-at-east-coast |archive-date=16 July 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Bedok Jetty===\n'''Bedok Jetty''' is the longest fishing jetty\u2014{{cvt|250|m}}\u2014in [[Singapore]]. It is located in [https://web.archive.org/web/20120330094954/http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/images/park_images/ECP_MAP_E_F.JPG Area&nbsp;F] of East Coast Park.\n\nIt is the most popular jetty for fishing in Singapore, but it is also frequented by cyclists, [[rollerblade|rollerbladers]], joggers or park visitors since it is part of the East Coast Park.\n\nBedok Jetty was originally built by a local businessman Mr Yap Swee Hong at a cost of $1.5&nbsp;million in 1966. He did this to facilitate the importation of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, it was in a poor state, with ''The Straits Times'' noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1&nbsp;million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|{{Center|View of Bedok Jetty}} {{Center|from East Coast Park}}]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in the East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space. The enhancements were carried out with drainage upgrading for a {{cvt|230|m}} section of the Siglap Canal to the sea.\n\n===Parkland Green===\nParkland Green is a {{convert|4|ha|acres|abbr=on}} cluster of restaurants, cafes and shops next to Carpark C1. \n\nParkland Green opened to much fanfare in September 2014, and in its first few months of operation, experienced high footfall, especially on weekends. However, with the imposition of parking fees for its carpark and the opening of Marine Cove in June 2016, customer numbers and revenues decreased sharply in the second half of 2016.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news |last=Singh |first=Bryna |date=11 December 2016 |title=Where are the crowds? |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/where-are-the-crowds |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |accessdate=8 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808142457/https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/where-are-the-crowds |archive-date=8 August 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe park is accessible by East Coast Park Service Road with numerous exits along the [[East Coast Parkway]]. Ample parking space is provided with many carparks situated in various locations in the park. [[SBS Transit]] Bus Service 401 stops along the East Coast Park Service Road from [[Bedok Bus Interchange]] during weekends and public holidays. [[Underpass]]es link the park to the nearby [[Marine Parade]] housing estate.<ref name=\"NN\"/>\n\nThe park is also connected to other parks in Singapore through the Park Connector Network, being part of the Eastern Coastal Park Connector Network. Within the park, footpaths and cycling paths allow access to pedestrians and cyclists respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nparks.gov.sg/~/media/nparks-real-content/gardens-parks-and-nature/park-connector-network/00-pcn-overview-page/ecpcn_d5.ashx |title=A Guide to Eastern Coastal Park Connector Network (ECPCN) Cycling Trail |website=nparks.gov.sg |publisher=NParks |accessdate=5 December 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of parks in Singapore]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|East Coast Park}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20141226093639/http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/ National Parks Board, Singapore]  \n*[https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/east-coast-park East Coast Park]\n\n{{Parks in Singapore}}\n{{Places in Singapore}}\n\n[[Category:Parks in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Bedok]]\n[[Category:Marine Parade]]\n[[Category:Tampines]]\n[[Category:Kallang]]\n[[Category:Marina East]]\n[[Category:Venues of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics]]\n", "name_user": "Twofingered Typist", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTransportation:rem duplicate WP link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_Park"}

Once there, they are cut off from the outside world, challenged to survive the night and escape the estate. To do this, the guests team up with him to participate in challenges and [[escape room]] puzzles, competing with each other to escape from the historical era by solving and completing them. At the end of each episode, two guests are voted into a challenge to compete against each other, where the losing guest is eliminated via a fictional death until one or more guests ultimately win and are sent back to the modern world.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nYouTube announced [[YouTube Red|YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red)]], a paid subscription service that would allow

He was an active member of the irregular [[freemasonic]] lodge, the [[Grand Orient of Russia\u2019s Peoples]].<ref name=\"mason\">\n{{cite news\n|url= http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/russia/russian_masons.html\n|title= Noteworthy members of the Grand Orient of France in Russia and the Supreme Council of the Grand Orient of Russia's People\n|date= 15 October 2017\n|work= Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon\n|page=  \n}}</ref>\n\nLiving in St Petersburg, he edited Menshevik publications until facing exile to [[Minusinsk]] following the outbreak of [[World War I]]. He was released in 1915 when he agreed to serve in the Army as a surgeon. He returned to St Petersburg following the [[February Revolution]] and argued for Menshevik involvement in the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]]. He also argued for continuing the war against [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].\n\nIn 1917, he was the leading Menshevik on the praesidium of the [[Petrograd Soviet]]. He opposed the [[October Revolution]] and he was a member of the small oppositional group in the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]. However, this was banned in 1918. Dan continued to denounce the curtailment of political freedoms, linking [[Bolshevism]] with [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakuninism]].\n\n===Exile===\nDan was arrested in 1921 and after a year in prison was sent into exile.<ref name=JTABulletin/> When the [[Soviet Union]] was attacked in 1941, Dan gave his support to the regime. In his book ''The Origins of Bolshevism'' (1943) he argued that Bolshevism was the carrier of [[socialism]], whilst still arguing for political liberalisation in the Soviet Union.\n\n==Death==\nDan left France during the [[Second World War]] for refuge in the [[United states of america|United States]].
