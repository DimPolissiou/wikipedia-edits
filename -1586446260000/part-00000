Among their well-known songs are \"[[Danny's Song]]\", \"[[House at Pooh Corner (song)|House at Pooh Corner]]\", and \"[[Your Mama Don't Dance]]\". After selling more than 16 million records and becoming one of the leading musical duos of the 1970s,<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\">\"Together again: Kenny Loggins and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] bring their hits to Biloxi,\" by Ron Thibodeaux, The Times-Picayune (New Orleans), July 29, 2005.</ref> Loggins and Messina broke up in 1976. Although Messina would find only limited popularity following the breakup, Loggins went on to further success in the 1980s. In 2005 and again in 2009, Loggins and Messina have reformed for tours in the United States.\n\n==History==\n===Initial career 1971\u20131976===\n[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], formerly of [[Poco]] and [[Buffalo Springfield]], was working as an independent record producer for [[Columbia Records]] in 1970 when he met [[Kenny Loggins]], a little-known singer/songwriter and guitarist who was signed to [[ABC-Dunhill]] as a staff songwriter.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=766}}</ref>\n\nThe two recorded a number of Loggins' compositions in Messina's home living room. When Columbia signed Loggins to a six-album contract (with the assistance of Messina), recording began in earnest for Loggins' debut album, with Messina as producer. Messina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messina's well-established Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences. But by the time the album was completed, Messina had contributed so much to the album - in terms of songwriting, arrangement, instrumentation, and vocals - that an \"accidental\" duo was born.\n\nTheir debut album was released November 1971 as ''Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina [[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Sittin' In]]''. The album's first single release, the Caribbean-flavored \"Vahevala\" (or \"Vahevella\" or \"Vaheevella\"), found top 3 success on Chicago's [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] on 18 May 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/ilc/wcfl051872.htm|title=WCFL - all hit music in the Midwest|publisher=Oldiesloon.com|date=1972-05-18|accessdate=2013-01-05}}</ref>  \"Vahevala\"  and \"Nobody But You\" both reached the [[Hot 100]].  Although at first the album went unnoticed by radio upon release, it eventually gained traction by autumn 1972, particularly on college campuses, where the pair toured heavily.  Loggins' and Messina's harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a one-off album became an entity unto itself.  Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a well-known producer.  Instead of just continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer, they decided to record as a duo \u2013 Loggins & Messina.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n\"When our first album, 'Sittin' In,' came out, we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales,\" Messina recalled in 2005. \"We had a choice. It was either I now go on and continue to produce him and we do the solo career or we stay together and let this work. For me, I did not desire to go back out on the road. I had had enough of that, and I wanted to produce records. But [[Clive Davis]] (then president of the record company) intervened and said, 'You know, I think you'd be making a mistake if you guys didn't take this opportunity. Things like this only happen once in a lifetime. It may merit you sleeping on it overnight and making a decision that will be in your best interest.' He was absolutely correct. Kenny made the decision as well. It delayed his solo career, but it gave him an opportunity, I think, to have one.\"<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" />\n\nMessina assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning old friends, bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante, formerly of [[The Sunshine Company]], multireedist [[Jon Clarke (musician)|Jon Clarke]], and violinist/multireedist Al Garth. Famed [[Grammy]]-winning keyboardist, songwriter and record producer [[Michael Omartian]] played on the debut album, but did not join them on tour, although he played keyboards on the [[Loggins and Messina (album)|second]] and [[Full Sail (Loggins and Messina album)|third]] albums. Los Angeles-based session percussionist [[Milt Holland]] played on each of the duo's studio albums, but like Omartian, he did not tour with them either.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flans |first=Robyn |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-loggins-messinas-vahevala/375146 |title=Classic Tracks: Loggins & Messina's \"Vahevala\" |publisher=Mixonline |date=2004-01-09 |accessdate=2015-08-26}}</ref>\n\nOver the next four years they produced five more original albums, plus one album of [[Cover version|covers]] of other artists' material, and two live albums. They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s, surpassed later in the decade only by [[Hall & Oates]].<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" /> They charted three Top 20 singles from the second and third albums: \"[[Your Mama Don't Dance]]\" (#4), \"Thinking of You\" (#18), and \"My Music\" (#16). Their work was covered by other prominent artists, including [[Lynn Anderson]], who recorded \"[[Listen to a Country Song (song)|Listen to a Country Song]]\" in 1972 and reached #3 on the charts, and [[Anne Murray]], who reached the U.S. top ten with \"[[Danny's Song]]\" in early 1973 and the U.S. top twenty with \"[[A Love Song (Loggins and Messina song)|A Love Song]]\" in early 1974.  A greatest-hits album, ''[[The Best of Friends (album)|The Best of Friends]]'', was released a year after the duo separated.  The later studio albums often found both Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record rather than as a genuine partnership.  As both Loggins and Messina noted in 2005, their collaboration eventually became more a competition.\n\nNever really a team of true equals because of the teacher\u2013apprentice nature of their music experience levels, the pair had by early 1976 quietly, amicably parted to pursue solo careers, following the release of ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Prior to the duo's final tour, Loggins accidentally cut his hand with a [[craft knife]] while practicing his wood-carving hobby at home, which required surgery and prevented him from playing guitar for most of their final tour. After a final concert in [[Hawaii]], the duo split and went on to solo careers. Messina found solo success elusive, but Loggins went on to become one of the biggest hit makers of the 1980s.\n\n===Reformation===\nThe two reunited in 2005 to choose tracks for an expanded compilation album of singles and album cuts ''[[The Best: Sittin' In Again]]'', which proved successful enough for them to embark on tour together.  Their successful \"Sittin' In Again\" tour was launched in mid-2005 and played out the remainder of the year. They also released an album that year of the tour.  \"Every couple of years we'd talk about it, but I was having too much fun as a solo artist,\" Loggins said that summer.  \"It was very rewarding for me, and I wasn't ready to share the reins.  I still had a lot of stuff to do on my own, to prove myself and to express myself, in a way that wouldn't have fit in with Loggins & Messina.\"<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" />\n\nThe two were pleased enough to consider future Loggins and Messina projects and the two also toured in 2009.  \"Like most relationships, we were a moment in time,\" Loggins said.  \"It's just really fun to be able to go back and celebrate that and just sort of really honor each other as grown men, in a way we never really did back then.  We were young and competitive and didn't realize that it wasn't necessarily all about getting your way, but you learn that if you grow up.\"<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" />\n\nTheir backing band changed from album to album, with the core members listed below.  Many albums featured backing members who were well known in their own right; [[John Townsend (artist)|John Townsend]] and [[Ed Sanford]], later of the [[Sanford-Townsend Band]] (\"[[Smoke from a Distant Fire]]\"), contributed vocals and songwriting to the ''Native Sons'', their final studio album.\n\n==Members==\n*[[Kenny Loggins]] &ndash; [[vocals]], [[rhythm guitar]], [[acoustic guitar]], [[harmonica]] \n*[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] &ndash; vocals, [[lead guitar]], acoustic guitar, [[mandolin]], [[dobro]]\n\n;Supporting personnel\n*Al Garth &ndash; [[tenor saxophone]], [[bass clarinet]], [[alto saxophone]], [[violin]], [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[viola]], [[percussion]], [[steel drum]] and [[backing vocals|vocals]]\n*Jon Clarke &ndash; [[baritone saxophone]], [[English horn]], [[flute]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[soprano saxophone]], [[bass saxophone]], [[bass clarinet]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[bass flute]], [[oboe]], [[steel drum]] and [[percussion]] (died in 2005)\n*Larry Sims &ndash; [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[backing vocals|vocals]] (died in 2014)\n*Merel Bregante &ndash; [[drumkit|drums]], [[percussion]], [[timbales]] and [[backing vocals|vocals]]\n*[[Milt Holland]] &ndash; [[percussion]] (died in 2005)\n*[[Michael Omartian]] &ndash; [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[percussion]] and [[concertina]]\n*Vince Denham &ndash; flute, [[bass clarinet]], [[alto saxophone|alto]], soprano and tenor saxophone\n*Don Roberts &ndash; [[clarinet]], [[alto flute]], alto, baritone, soprano and tenor saxophone\n*Steve Forman - [[percussion]], [[vibraphone|vibes]]\n*[[David Paich]] - keyboards\n*Dave Wallace - synthesizer\n*Chris Brooks - [[koto (instrument)|koto]]\n*[[Michel Rubini]] - keyboards\n*Richard Greene &ndash; violin, mandolin, [[mandocello]]\n*Rusty Young - dobro\n*Vince Charles - steel drums\n*Victor Feldman - percussion\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Los Angeles-based session percussionist [[Milt Holland]] played on each of the duo's studio albums, but like Omartian, he did not tour with them either.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flans |first=Robyn |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-loggins-messinas-vahevala/375146 |title=Classic Tracks: Loggins & Messina's \"Vahevala\" |publisher=Mixonline |date=2004-01-09 |accessdate=2015-08-26}}</ref>\n\nOver the next four years they produced five more original albums, plus one album of [[Cover version|covers]] of other artists' material, and two live albums. They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s, surpassed later in the decade only by [[Hall & Oates]].<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" /> They charted three Top 20 singles from the second and third albums: \"[[Your Mama Don't Dance]]\" (#4), \"Thinking of You\" (#18), and \"My Music\" (#16). Their work was covered by other prominent artists, including [[Lynn Anderson]], who recorded \"[[Listen to a Country Song (song)|Listen to a Country Song]]\" in 1972 and reached #3 on the charts, and [[Anne Murray]], who reached the U.S. top ten with \"[[Danny's Song]]\" in early 1973 and the U.S. top twenty with \"[[A Love Song (Loggins and Messina song)|A Love Song]]\" in early 1974.  A greatest-hits album, ''[[The Best of Friends (album)|The Best of Friends]]'', was released a year after the duo separated.  The later studio albums often found both Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record rather than as a genuine partnership.  As both Loggins and Messina noted in 2005, their collaboration eventually became more a competition.\n\nNever really a team of true equals because of the teacher\u2013apprentice nature of their music experience levels, the pair had by early 1976 quietly, amicably parted to pursue solo careers, following the release of ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Prior to the duo's final tour, Loggins accidentally cut his hand with a [[craft knife]] while practicing his wood-carving hobby at home, which required surgery and prevented him from playing guitar for most of their final tour. After a final concert in [[Hawaii]], the duo split and went on to solo careers. Messina found solo success elusive, but Loggins went on to become one of the biggest hit makers of the 1980s.\n\n===Reformation===\nThe two reunited in 2005 to choose tracks for an expanded compilation album of singles and album cuts ''[[The Best: Sittin' In Again]]'', which proved successful enough for them to embark on tour together.  Their successful \"Sittin' In Again\" tour was launched in mid-2005 and played out the remainder of the year. They also released an album that year of the tour.  \"Every couple of years we'd talk about it, but I was having too much fun as a solo artist,\" Loggins said that summer.  \"It was very rewarding for me, and I wasn't ready to share the reins.  I still had a lot of stuff to do on my own, to prove myself and to express myself, in a way that wouldn't have fit in with Loggins & Messina.\"<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" />\n\nThe two were pleased enough to consider future Loggins and Messina projects and the two also toured in 2009.  \"Like most relationships, we were a moment in time,\" Loggins said.  \"It's just really fun to be able to go back and celebrate that and just sort of really honor each other as grown men, in a way we never really did back then.  We were young and competitive and didn't realize that it wasn't necessarily all about getting your way, but you learn that if you grow up.\"<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" />\n\nTheir backing band changed from album to album, with the core members listed below.  Many albums featured backing members who were well known in their own right; [[John Townsend (artist)|John Townsend]] and [[Ed Sanford]], later of the [[Sanford-Townsend Band]] (\"[[Smoke from a Distant Fire]]\"), contributed vocals and songwriting to the ''Native Sons'', their final studio album.\n\n==Members==\n*[[Kenny Loggins]] &ndash; [[vocals]], [[rhythm guitar]], [[acoustic guitar]], [[harmonica]] \n*[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] &ndash; vocals, [[lead guitar]], acoustic guitar, [[mandolin]], [[dobro]]\n\n;Supporting personnel\n*Al Garth &ndash; [[tenor saxophone]], [[bass clarinet]], [[alto saxophone]], [[violin]], [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[viola]], [[percussion]], [[steel drum]] and [[backing vocals|vocals]]\n*Jon Clarke &ndash; [[baritone saxophone]], [[English horn]], [[flute]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[soprano saxophone]], [[bass saxophone]], [[bass clarinet]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[bass flute]], [[oboe]], [[steel drum]] and [[percussion]] (died in 2005)\n*Larry Sims &ndash; [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[backing vocals|vocals]] (died in 2014)\n*Merel Bregante &ndash; [[drumkit|drums]], [[percussion]], [[timbales]] and [[backing vocals|vocals]]\n*[[Milt Holland]] &ndash; [[percussion]] (died in 2005)\n*[[Michael Omartian]] &ndash; [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[percussion]] and [[concertina]]\n*Vince Denham &ndash; flute, [[bass clarinet]], [[alto saxophone|alto]], soprano and tenor saxophone\n*Don Roberts &ndash; [[clarinet]], [[alto flute]], alto, baritone, soprano and tenor saxophone\n*Steve Forman - [[percussion]], [[vibraphone|vibes]]\n*[[David Paich]] - keyboards\n*Dave Wallace - synthesizer\n*Chris Brooks - [[koto (instrument)|koto]]\n*[[Michel Rubini]] - keyboards\n*Richard Greene &ndash; violin, mandolin, [[mandocello]]\n*Rusty Young - dobro\n*Vince Charles - steel drums\n*Victor Feldman - percussion\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It referred to [[Army Ground Forces]], [[United States Army Air Forces]], and [[Army Service Forces]] operations north of Italy<!-- what about the Balkans ETO or MTO? --> and the [[Mediterranean]] coast, in the [[European theatre of World War II|European Theater of World War II]]. It was bordered to the south by the North African Theater of Operations, US Army (NATOUSA), which later became the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] (MTOUSA).\n\nThe term ''theater of operations'' was defined in the US Army field manuals as ''the land and sea areas to be invaded or defended, including areas necessary for administrative activities incident to the military operations''. In accordance with the experience of World War I, it was usually conceived of as a large land mass over which continuous operations would take place and was divided into two chief areas-the [[combat]] zone, or the area of active fighting, and the [[Communications Zone]], or area required for administration of the theater. As the armies advanced, both these zones and the areas into which they were divided would shift forward to new geographic areas of control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/orgadmin/org_admin_wwii_chpt7.htm |title=Medical department United States Army in World War II: Chapter VII: Prewar Army Doctrine for Theater |author= [[Blanche B.

Its mission was to conduct planning for the eventual retaking of Europe and to exercise administrative and operational control over U.S. forces.\n\nThe 133rd Infantry Regiment of the [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|34th Infantry Division]] was the first [[United States Army]] unit sent to Europe in World War II. The first battalion arrived in [[Belfast]] in late January 1942, followed by the rest of the regiment in February. These units were designated as U.S. Army Northern Ireland Forces, later incorporated within the European Theater of Operations. The 133rd and 168th Infantry Regiments trained in the peat bogs, and performed border guard patrols between British Northern Ireland and the neutral [[Irish Free State]]. The remaining unit of the division, the 135th Infantry Regiment, arrived in May 1942.\n\nFrom February 1944 the operational command was the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) which as an Allied command also had operational control of British and all other allied land forces and tactical airforces in the European [[Theater (warfare)|theatre]]. Until SHAEF was operational ETOUSA liaised closely with the British in the planning and organising of [[Operation Overlord]].\n\nU.S. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] had multiple command appointments; he replaced Chaney in late June 1942, but in November he also commanded the Allied forces in [[Operation Torch]] through AFHQ. He then relinquished command of ETOUSA to Lt. Gen. [[Frank M. Andrews]] in February 1943, who was killed in an air crash in May. He was replaced by Lt. Gen. [[Jacob L. Devers]], former Chief of the Armored Force. In December 1943 it was announced that Eisenhower would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. In January 1944 he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces. (Note that Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF) was the headquarters of the Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, whereas the AFHQ was the headquarters of only the Allied forces.) He served in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945. From February 1944, SHAEF was the operational command and ETOUSA administrative command.\n\nSome units were transferred between operational commands and administrative commands at different times. For example, the [[American 6th Army Group]], which was set up under the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] to oversee [[Operation Dragoon]], the invasion of [[Southern France]] between [[Toulon]] and [[Cannes]], was passed to SHAEF (and into ETO) a month after the invasion which took place on 15 August 1944.\n\nBy the end of 1944, Eisenhower, through SHAEF, commanded three powerful Allied army groups. In the north [[British 21st Army Group]] commanded by Field Marshal [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] (''\"Monty\"''), in the middle the [[American 12th Army Group]] commanded by General [[Omar N. Bradley]], and in the South the [[American 6th Army Group]] commanded by Devers. The British 21st Army Group and French elements of the 6th Army Group were not part of ETOUSA, but by that stage of the war most of the operational forces under the command of SHAEF were American.\n\nThe ETOUSA planning staff in London was usually referred to by its [[Army Post Office]] number, \"APO 887\". After the war in Europe ended, ETOUSA became briefly U.S. Armed Forces Europe, then U.S. Forces, European Theater (USFET), and then, eventually, [[United States Army Europe]].\n\n==Campaigns and operations==\n[[File:Theater of operations.gif|thumb|325px|right|Chart 12.- Typical organization of a theater of operations as envisaged by War Department Doctrine, 1940.]]\n{{details|United States theaters of operations in World War II}}\n\n[[Operation Torch]]\u2014the invasion of French North Africa\u2014involving the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th]], [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry]] and the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored]] Divisions, initiated on 8 November 1942, was the first ground combat operations for the United States in World War II.<ref>American \"observers\" had participated in the [[Dieppe Raid]] in August 1942</ref>\n\n[[Albert Coady Wedemeyer]] was chief author of the ''Victory Program'', published three months before the U.S. entered the war in 1941, which advocated the defeat of the German armies on the European continent. When the U.S. entered the war after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the U.S. was at war with both Japan and Germany, a \"[[Europe first]]\" a modified version of his plan was adopted by U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].

It referred to [[Army Ground Forces]], [[United States Army Air Forces]], and [[Army Service Forces]] operations north of Italy<!-- what about the Balkans ETO or MTO? --> and the [[Mediterranean]] coast, in the [[European theatre of World War II|European Theater of World War II]]. It was bordered to the south by the North African Theater of Operations, US Army (NATOUSA), which later became the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] (MTOUSA).\n\nThe term ''theater of operations'' was defined in the US Army field manuals as ''the land and sea areas to be invaded or defended, including areas necessary for administrative activities incident to the military operations''. In accordance with the experience of World War I, it was usually conceived of as a large land mass over which continuous operations would take place and was divided into two chief areas-the [[combat]] zone, or the area of active fighting, and the [[Communications Zone]], or area required for administration of the theater. As the armies advanced, both these zones and the areas into which they were divided would shift forward to new geographic areas of control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/orgadmin/org_admin_wwii_chpt7.htm |title=Medical department United States Army in World War II: Chapter VII: Prewar Army Doctrine for Theater |author= [[Blanche B.

Lee]] became Commanding General, Services of Supply, U.S. Army Forces British Isles, and later deputy theater commander, ETOUSA.<ref>{{cite web |title=CHAPTER XV Command Reorganization, June\u2013October 1944 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Supreme/USA-E-Supreme-15.html |publisher=ibiblio.org}}</ref> On 8 June 1942, the [[United States Department of War]] officially established ETOUSA in its place. Its mission was to conduct planning for the eventual retaking of Europe and to exercise administrative and operational control over U.S. forces.\n\nThe 133rd Infantry Regiment of the [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|34th Infantry Division]] was the first [[United States Army]] unit sent to Europe in World War II. The first battalion arrived in [[Belfast]] in late January 1942, followed by the rest of the regiment in February. These units were designated as U.S. Army Northern Ireland Forces, later incorporated within the European Theater of Operations. The 133rd and 168th Infantry Regiments trained in the peat bogs, and performed border guard patrols between British Northern Ireland and the neutral [[Irish Free State]]. The remaining unit of the division, the 135th Infantry Regiment, arrived in May 1942.\n\nFrom February 1944 the operational command was the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) which as an Allied command also had operational control of British and all other allied land forces and tactical airforces in the European [[Theater (warfare)|theatre]]. Until SHAEF was operational ETOUSA liaised closely with the British in the planning and organising of [[Operation Overlord]].\n\nU.S. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] had multiple command appointments; he replaced Chaney in late June 1942, but in November he also commanded the Allied forces in [[Operation Torch]] through AFHQ. He then relinquished command of ETOUSA to Lt. Gen. [[Frank M. Andrews]] in February 1943, who was killed in an air crash in May. He was replaced by Lt. Gen. [[Jacob L. Devers]], former Chief of the Armored Force. In December 1943 it was announced that Eisenhower would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. In January 1944 he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces. (Note that Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF) was the headquarters of the Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, whereas the AFHQ was the headquarters of only the Allied forces.) He served in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945. From February 1944, SHAEF was the operational command and ETOUSA administrative command.\n\nSome units were transferred between operational commands and administrative commands at different times. For example, the [[American 6th Army Group]], which was set up under the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] to oversee [[Operation Dragoon]], the invasion of [[Southern France]] between [[Toulon]] and [[Cannes]], was passed to SHAEF (and into ETO) a month after the invasion which took place on 15 August 1944.\n\nBy the end of 1944, Eisenhower, through SHAEF, commanded three powerful Allied army groups. In the north [[British 21st Army Group]] commanded by Field Marshal [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] (''\"Monty\"''), in the middle the [[American 12th Army Group]] commanded by General [[Omar N. Bradley]], and in the South the [[American 6th Army Group]] commanded by Devers. The British 21st Army Group and French elements of the 6th Army Group were not part of ETOUSA, but by that stage of the war most of the operational forces under the command of SHAEF were American.\n\nThe ETOUSA planning staff in London was usually referred to by its [[Army Post Office]] number, \"APO 887\". After the war in Europe ended, ETOUSA became briefly U.S. Armed Forces Europe, then U.S. Forces, European Theater (USFET), and then, eventually, [[United States Army Europe]].\n\n==Campaigns and operations==\n[[File:Theater of operations.gif|thumb|325px|right|Chart 12.- Typical organization of a theater of operations as envisaged by War Department Doctrine, 1940.]]\n{{details|United States theaters of operations in World War II}}\n\n[[Operation Torch]]\u2014the invasion of French North Africa\u2014involving the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th]], [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry]] and the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored]] Divisions, initiated on 8 November 1942, was the first ground combat operations for the United States in World War II.<ref>American \"observers\" had participated in the [[Dieppe Raid]] in August 1942</ref>\n\n[[Albert Coady Wedemeyer]] was chief author of the ''Victory Program'', published three months before the U.S. entered the war in 1941, which advocated the defeat of the German armies on the European continent. When the U.S. entered the war after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the U.S. was at war with both Japan and Germany, a \"[[Europe first]]\" a modified version of his plan was adopted by U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]. Under the German first policy, the plan was expanded to include the [[blueprint]] for the [[Normandy]] landings.\n\n*[[List of air operations during the Battle of Europe]] 1 September 1939 \u2013 7 May 1945\n*[[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy Campaign]] 6 June 1944 \u2013 24 July 1944\n*[[Operation Overlord|Northern France Campaign]] 25 July 1944 \u2013 14 September 1944\n*[[Operation Dragoon|Southern France Campaign]]\n*[[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|Rhineland Campaign]]\n*[[Lorraine Campaign]] (unofficial) 1 September 1944 \u2013 18 December 1944\n*[[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes\u2013Alsace Campaign]] 16 December 1944 \u2013 25 January 1945 (\"Battle of the Bulge\")\n*[[Western Allied invasion of Germany|Central Europe Campaign]] 22 March 1945 \u2013 11 May 1945\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|World War II}}\n*[[China Burma India Theater of Operations]]\n*[[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]]\n*[[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]]\n*[[United States Army Europe]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/11-9/ETO.htm |title=The European Theater of Operations |publisher=history.army.mil}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book| publisher = Office of the Theater Historian Paris, France| title = ORDER OF BATTLE OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY WORLD WAR II \u2013 EUROPEAN THEATER OF OPERATIONS |work=Office of the Theater Historian |location=Paris, France |date=December 1945 | url=http://www.history.army.mil/documents/ETO-OB/ETOOB-TOC.htm| accessdate = 9 June 2010}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/listofholdingshtml/listofholdingsU/US_Army_US_Forces_European_Theater_Historical_Division_Admnandlogistical.pdf Abstract for USAFBI & ETOUSA records at the Eisenhower Library]\n\n{{World War II US Army Commands}}\n\n[[Category:European theatre of World War II]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1942]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations of the United States Army in World War II]]\n", "name_user": "Lieutcoluseng", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing style/layout errors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Theater_of_Operations,_United_States_Army"}
