In 1995, Kraft worked as story-editor and scripter for the short-lived animated series ''[[G.I. Joe Extreme]]''. Kraft is the co-writer and editor of ''Yi Soon Shin: Warrior and Defender'' by Onrie Kompan Productions, LLC.\n\n== Publisher, critic and literary agent ==\n\n=== Fictioneer Books ===\nIn 1974, Kraft founded the specialty science fiction publisher Fictioneer Books. Over the years, Fictioneer has published books by such authors as [[A. E. van Vogt]], [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Jack London]], [[Otis Adelbert Kline]], and [[Don McGregor]].<ref name=\"DragonCon\" />\n\nFictioneer and its imprint '''Comics Interview Group''' published magazines including ''David Anthony Kraft's Comics Interview'', trade journals such as ''Comics Revue'', and the trade text ''100 Hot Tips from Top Comics Creators'' (1994). In early 1985 Comics Interview Group branched out into comic books by taking on Henry and Audrey Vogel's ''[[Southern Knights]]'' (previously a self-published series). In 1986 they expanded their comics lineup with ''MICRA''  and ''Aristocratic Xtraterrestrial Time-Traveling Thieves'', and began publishing a number of ''Southern Knights'' reprints in the form of graphic novels, one-shots, and limited series. Though 1988 saw them also introduce [[Julie Woodcock]] and [[Brian Stelfreeze]]'s ''CyCops'', none of their comics publications sold as well as ''Southern Knights'', and by the end of that year they had stopped publishing any other titles. In mid-1989 ''Southern Knights'' was canceled as well, and the Comics Interview imprint was again devoted solely to magazines and trade publications although they would co-publish ''Southern Knights'' No. 35 and 36 in 1992.\n\n; Comics Interview\nIn 1983, Kraft founded ''David Anthony Kraft's Comics Interview'', with ran for 150 issues<ref>{{cite journal|title= Newswatch: ''Comics Interview'' Gives Up the Ghost|journal= [[The Comics Journal]]|issue= 183|page= 28|publisher= [[Fantagraphics Books]]|date= January 1996|location= Seattle, Washington}}</ref> between 1983 and 1995,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.lib.msu.edu/rri/krri/kra.htm#kraftda |title=Index to the Comic Art Collection |publisher=[[Michigan State University Libraries]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sbXKC3fK?url=http://comics.lib.msu.edu/rri/krri/kra.htm |archivedate=September 9, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and garnered [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Eagle Award (comics)|Eagle Award]] nominations.

With an interest in exploring craft skills, he took courses at the local Buffalo [[YWCA]] craft program, where he later taught [[studio pottery|ceramic]] classes. He also took a few classes at the School for American Craftsmen (now the [[School for American Crafts]]) at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]; this interest led   to his membership in the organization Buffalo Craftsmen, where he served as president in 1962, and his active involvement with York State Craftsmen, a state organization that held an annual craft fair in [[Ithaca, New York]].\n\nHe took a position in the display department of the [[Flint & Kent]] department store in 1953, and was appointed Display Director there in 1955.<ref>A brief overview of Smith's early career can be found in Glenn Adamson, \u201cGatherings: Creating the Studio Craft Movement,\u201d in Jeannine Falino, ed., Crafting Modernism: Midcentury American Art and Design (New York: Abrams; Museum of Arts and Design, 2011), p. 41, as well as a biographical entry in the same text, p. 311\u201312.

Under the guidance of the Football Alliance (FA) in partnership with United Football Clubs Association (UFCA), the UFL flourished. However, the PFF expressed the need to have a nationwide, community-based football league that is at par with the standards set by the [[FIFA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA) and the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC).<ref name=\"gma1\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/337938/sports/football/philippine-football-federation-set-to-launch-national-league |title=Philippine Football Federation set to launch national league |last=Bautista |first=Roehl Ni\u00f1o |date=2 December 2013 |work=[[GMA News]] |access-date=8 September 2016}}</ref> The UFL, which is under the [[National Capital Region F.A.|National Capital Region Football Association]], cannot be considered as a national league.\n\n===Foundations===\n[[File:PFL Philippines Nielsen Study Cited Localities map.svg|250px|thumb|alt=Map showing the 13 localities (provinces, cities or municipalities) in red deemed viable home venues for prospect clubs of the Philippines Football League|13 localities deemed viable home venues by the Nielsen Company for prospect clubs in the PFL.<ref name=\"cnnph1\"/>\n{{smalldiv|\n{{unbulleted list|'''[[Luzon]]''': [[Manila]], [[Makati]], [[Quezon City]], [[Marikina]], [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]] ([[Bulacan]]), [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Pampanga]]|'''[[Visayas]]''': [[Cebu]], [[Bacolod]], [[Iloilo]]|'''[[Mindanao]]''': [[Davao City]], [[Cagayan de Oro]], [[Zamboanga City]]}}}}\n]]\nWith the goal of establishing a truly nationwide professional football league in the Philippines, the PFF launched the PFF National League Task Force on December 2, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=PFF to Establish National League in 2016|url=http://pff.org.ph/2013/12/02/pff-to-establish-national-league-in-2016/|publisher=Philippine Football Federation|accessdate=9 September 2016|date=2 December 2013}}</ref> The task force was led by Filipino economist Bernie Villegas, and is composed of UFL President Randy Roxas, AFC Deputy General Secretary and Competition Director Windsor John, Filipino FIFA official Domeka Garamendi, AFC Kick-off Program Director Yogesh Desai, UFL Commissioner Bonnie Ladrido, [[ABS-CBN]]'s Dino Laurena, former PFF' General Secretary Cyril Dofitas and Gelix Mercader.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://sg.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/thepassionatefan/pff-announces-national-football-league-launch-2015-2016-094223380.html |title=PFF announces national football league to launch in 2015 or 2016 |last=Guerrero |first=Bob |date=2 December 2013 |work=Passionate Fan |publisher=[[Yahoo!
