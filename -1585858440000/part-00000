While the uprising was part of a larger one that included other provinces opposed to the regime of President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], the Mexican government believed the United States had instigated the Texas insurrection with the goal of annexation. The Mexican Congress passed the [[Tornel Decree]], declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops \"will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag\". Only the province of Texas succeeded in breaking with Mexico, establishing the [[Republic of Texas]], and eventually being annexed by the [[United States]].\n\nThe revolution began in October 1835, after a decade of political and cultural clashes between the Mexican government and the increasingly large population of American settlers in Texas. The Mexican government had become increasingly [[centralized government|centralized]] and the rights of its citizens had become increasingly curtailed, particularly regarding immigration from the United States. Colonists and Tejanos disagreed on whether the ultimate goal was independence or a return to the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution of 1824]].  While delegates at the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]] (provisional government) debated the war's motives, [[Texians]] and a flood of volunteers from the United States defeated the small garrisons of Mexican soldiers by mid-December 1835. The Consultation declined to declare independence and installed an interim government, whose infighting led to political paralysis and a dearth of effective governance in Texas.  An ill-conceived proposal to [[Matamoros Expedition|invade Matamoros]] siphoned much-needed volunteers and provisions from the fledgling [[Texian Army]].  In March 1836, a second [[convention of 1836|political convention]] declared independence and appointed leadership for the new [[Republic of Texas]].\n\nDetermined to avenge Mexico's honor, Santa Anna vowed to personally retake Texas.  His Army of Operations entered Texas in mid-February 1836 and found the Texians completely unprepared. Mexican General [[Jos\u00e9 de Urrea]] led a contingent of troops on the [[Goliad Campaign]] up the Texas coast, defeating all Texian troops in his path and executing most of those who surrendered. Santa Anna led a larger force to [[San Antonio|San Antonio de B\u00e9xar]] (or B\u00e9xar), where his troops defeated the Texian garrison in the [[Battle of the Alamo]], killing almost all of the defenders. \n\nA newly created Texian army under the command of [[Sam Houston]] was constantly on the move, while terrified civilians fled with the army, in a melee known as the [[Runaway Scrape]]. On March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing on the [[Brazos River]], and for the next two weeks, the Texians received rigorous military training. Becoming complacent and underestimating the strength of his foes, Santa Anna further subdivided his troops. On April 21, Houston's army staged a surprise assault on Santa Anna and his vanguard force at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. The Mexican troops were quickly routed, and vengeful Texians executed many who tried to surrender.  Santa Anna was taken hostage; in exchange for his life, he ordered the Mexican army to retreat south of the [[Rio Grande]].  Mexico refused to recognize the Republic of Texas, and intermittent conflicts between the two countries continued into the 1840s.  The [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] as the 28th state of the United States, in 1845, led directly to the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Main article|Mexican Texas}}\nAfter a failed attempt by France to [[French colonization of Texas|colonize Texas]] in the late 17th century, Spain developed a plan to settle the region.<ref>Weber (1992), pp. 149\u2013154.</ref> On its southern edge, along the [[Medina River|Medina]] and [[Nueces River]]s, [[Spanish Texas]] was bordered by the province of [[Coahuila]].<ref name=edmondson6>Edmondson (2000), p. 6.</ref>  On the east, Texas bordered [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=edmonson10>Edmondson (2000), p. 10.</ref>  Following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, the United States also claimed the land west of the [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]], all the way to the Rio Grande.<ref name=weber291>Weber (1992), p. 291.</ref> From 1812 to 1813 anti-Spanish republicans and U.S. [[filibuster (military)|filibusters]] rebelled against the [[Spanish Empire]] in what is known today as the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]] during the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. They won battles in the beginning and captured many Texas cities from the Spanish that led to a declaration of independence of the state of Texas as part of the Mexican Republic on April 17, 1813. The new Texas government and army met their doom in the [[Battle of Medina]] in August 1813, 20 miles south of [[San Antonio]], where 1,300 of the 1,400 rebel army were killed in battle or executed shortly afterwards by royalist soldiers. It was the deadliest single battle in Texas history. 300 republican government officials in San Antonio were captured and executed by the Spanish royalists shortly after the battle. What is significant is a Spanish royalist lieutenant named [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] fought in this battle and followed his superiors' orders to take no prisoners. Another interesting note is two founding fathers of the [[Republic of Texas]] and future signers of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] in 1836, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Navarro]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz]], took part in the Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition.<ref>https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfm01 .

While the uprising was part of a larger one that included other provinces opposed to the regime of President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], the Mexican government believed the United States had instigated the Texas insurrection with the goal of annexation. The Mexican Congress passed the [[Tornel Decree]], declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops \"will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag.\" Only the province of Texas succeeded in breaking with Mexico, establishing the [[Republic of Texas]], and eventually being annexed by the [[United States]].\n\nThe revolution began in October 1835, after a decade of political and cultural clashes between the Mexican government and the increasingly large population of American settlers in Texas. The Mexican government had become increasingly [[centralized government|centralized]] and the rights of its citizens had become increasingly curtailed, particularly regarding immigration from the United States. Colonists and Tejanos disagreed on whether the ultimate goal was independence or a return to the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution of 1824]].  While delegates at the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]] (provisional government) debated the war's motives, [[Texians]] and a flood of volunteers from the United States defeated the small garrisons of Mexican soldiers by mid-December 1835. The Consultation declined to declare independence and installed an interim government, whose infighting led to political paralysis and a dearth of effective governance in Texas.  An ill-conceived proposal to [[Matamoros Expedition|invade Matamoros]] siphoned much-needed volunteers and provisions from the fledgling [[Texian Army]].  In March 1836, a second [[convention of 1836|political convention]] declared independence and appointed leadership for the new [[Republic of Texas]].\n\nDetermined to avenge Mexico's honor, Santa Anna vowed to personally retake Texas.  His Army of Operations entered Texas in mid-February 1836 and found the Texians completely unprepared. Mexican General [[Jos\u00e9 de Urrea]] led a contingent of troops on the [[Goliad Campaign]] up the Texas coast, defeating all Texian troops in his path and executing most of those who surrendered. Santa Anna led a larger force to [[San Antonio|San Antonio de B\u00e9xar]] (or B\u00e9xar), where his troops defeated the Texian garrison in the [[Battle of the Alamo]], killing almost all of the defenders. \n\nA newly created Texian army under the command of [[Sam Houston]] was constantly on the move, while terrified civilians fled with the army, in a melee known as the [[Runaway Scrape]]. On March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing on the [[Brazos River]], and for the next two weeks, the Texians received rigorous military training. Becoming complacent and underestimating the strength of his foes, Santa Anna further subdivided his troops. On April 21, Houston's army staged a surprise assault on Santa Anna and his vanguard force at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. The Mexican troops were quickly routed, and vengeful Texians executed many who tried to surrender.  Santa Anna was taken hostage; in exchange for his life, he ordered the Mexican army to retreat south of the [[Rio Grande]].  Mexico refused to recognize the Republic of Texas, and intermittent conflicts between the two countries continued into the 1840s.  The [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] as the 28th state of the United States, in 1845, led directly to the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Main article|Mexican Texas}}\nAfter a failed attempt by France to [[French colonization of Texas|colonize Texas]] in the late 17th century, Spain developed a plan to settle the region.<ref>Weber (1992), pp. 149\u2013154.</ref> On its southern edge, along the [[Medina River|Medina]] and [[Nueces River]]s, [[Spanish Texas]] was bordered by the province of [[Coahuila]].<ref name=edmondson6>Edmondson (2000), p. 6.</ref>  On the east, Texas bordered [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=edmonson10>Edmondson (2000), p. 10.</ref>  Following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, the United States also claimed the land west of the [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]], all the way to the Rio Grande.<ref name=weber291>Weber (1992), p. 291.</ref> From 1812 to 1813 anti-Spanish republicans and U.S. [[filibuster (military)|filibusters]] rebelled against the [[Spanish Empire]] in what is known today as the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]] during the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. They won battles in the beginning and captured many Texas cities from the Spanish that led to a declaration of independence of the state of Texas as part of the Mexican Republic on April 17, 1813. The new Texas government and army met their doom in the [[Battle of Medina]] in August 1813, 20 miles south of [[San Antonio]], where 1,300 of the 1,400 rebel army were killed in battle or executed shortly afterwards by royalist soldiers. It was the deadliest single battle in Texas history. 300 republican government officials in San Antonio were captured and executed by the Spanish royalists shortly after the battle. What is significant is a Spanish royalist lieutenant named [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] fought in this battle and followed his superiors' orders to take no prisoners. Another interesting note is two founding fathers of the [[Republic of Texas]] and future signers of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] in 1836, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Navarro]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz]], took part in the Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition.<ref>https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfm01 .

In 1977 she helped found and then directed the first women's anti-pornography organization in the country.  Also in 1977, became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. She founded and directed The Protection Project, a legal research and human rights institute at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1997.  There, she collected and translated foreign national law on involuntary servitude, slavery, trafficking in persons and related issues and created an international database housing over 3,000 statutes from 190 countries. She also tracked global routes, patterns, and trends in human trafficking and published the first Human Rights Report on Trafficking in Persons. In 2000, she moved The Protection Project to Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), where it is housed today.\n\nDuring the drafting of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, from 1998 to 2000, she served as a witness in hearings held by Representatives Chris Smith and Sam Gjendenson in the House of Representatives International Subcommittee on Human Rights and the late Senator Paul Wellstone and Sam Brownback in the Senate, testifying on the global nature and scope of the problem of trafficking in persons. She brought trafficking victims from over a dozen countries to testify in Congress. In 1998, she also played a vital role in bringing together a new bi-partisan anti-trafficking coalition of women's groups such as Equality Now, and faith-based groups such as The Salvation Army, and the National Association of Evangelicals. This coalition played an important role in the passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.\n\nIn 2001, as Deputy Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State she helped stand up the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at the U.S. Department of State. In From 2002 \u2013 2007, she served as Senior Advisor on Trafficking in Persons to Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs, Paula J. Dobriansky. In that capacity she advised the Under Secretary on policy formulation and development, program creation and implementation, and long-range planning for the Office for Global Affairs. She represented the Under Secretary at high-level national and international meetings, spoke extensively as a recognized expert at governmental, inter-governmental, non-governmental, academic and other conferences, seminars, and meetings.  She also advised the Ambassador-at-Large on Trafficking in Persons and other key governmental officials, as well as serving as liaison to civil society.\n\n===Current career===\n\nCurrently Laura Lederer is affiliated with the anti-trafficking NGOs [[Global Centurion]] and [[Triple S Network]].\n\nShe is also an Adjunct Professor of Law at Georgetown Law Center where teaches (with Professor Mohamad Mattar) a course entitled, \"International Trafficking in Persons,\" a JD/LLM class that covers  U.S federal and state law on human trafficking; foreign national anti-trafficking law; and international instruments addressing human trafficking. The course also examines the global scope of the trafficking problem including trafficking routes and patterns; the similarities and differences between sex and labor trafficking; the relationship of human trafficking to drug and arms trafficking; trafficking and terrorism; the public health implications of trafficking; child sex tourism; trafficking and international migration; transnational issues in trafficking such as international peacekeeping, corruption, money-laundering, international adoption, and more.\n\n== Anti-Pornography Activism (1976\u20131981) ==\nIn late 1976, she accompanied a friend to a [[San Francisco]] conference on [[violence against women]]. A display at the conference included images from magazine [[advertising]], [[softcore pornography]], and [[hardcore pornography]], including [[child pornography]]. Lederer stated in a later interview: \"You saw the influence of the really hard-core images, back through the soft-core to the mainstream. Images were repeated. That's how I got involved. It kind of clicked.\"<ref name=simpson/>{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|p=136}} Several participants in the conference proposed to keep meeting and form an organization devoted to protesting violent images of women. In January 1977, this organization was started, which after several name changes became [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]] (WAVPM). Lederer signed on as the organization's national coordinator and editor of its newsletter.{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\nAs coordinator of WAVPM, Lederer helped organize protests and [[boycotts]] against companies such as [[Max Factor]] and [[Finnair]] whose advertising the organization felt encouraged violence against women.{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|pp=134\u2013135, 146\u2013148}} She also organized educational tours of pornographic businesses in San Francisco's [[red light districts]], a tactic later emulated by [[Women Against Pornography]].{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|p=142}} Lederer worked closely with then-[[San Francisco Board of Supervisors|Supervisor]] [[Dianne Feinstein]] on a San Francisco anti-pornography zoning ordinance targeting sex-related businesses. Lederer was aided in this effort by the fact that her father, in the role of Building Commissioner in Detroit, had worked vigorously for shaping and enforcing a similar zoning ordinance in that city. Lederer traveled to Detroit to research the ordinance there, and passed the results along to Feinstein. Though the zoning ordinance faced stiff opposition (notably from the San Francisco [[ACLU]] and from [[Harvey Milk]]), a milder version of this ordinance was passed in 1978.<ref>{{harvnb|Bronstein|2011|pp=210, 237}}, {{harvnb|Sides|2006|pp=370\u2013374}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1978, Lederer brought on Lynn Campbell to help organize WAVPM and together they helped organize Feminist Perspectives on Pornography, the first national [[anti-pornography]] feminist conference held in San Francisco on November 17\u201319, 1978. The conference drew many well known feminist speakers, notably [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Phyllis Chesler]], [[Kathleen Barry]], [[Susan Brownmiller]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]]. This conference was significant in that it served as a galvanizing event for the anti-pornography feminist movement in the United States. The final event of the conference was the first [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] march, which converged on the Broadway red light district.{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|pp=157\u2013169}} The talks given during the event were later collected in the [[anthology]] ''[[Take Back the Night: Women on Pornography|Take Back the Night]]''\u2014a work which was compiled and edited by Lederer and would go on to stand as a key document in the emerging feminist anti-pornography movement.{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|p=137}}\n\n== Anti-Human Trafficking Work ==\n\n===Early Anti-Human Trafficking Work (1993\u20132001)===\nIn 1994, Lederer founded The Protection Project, a legal research institute dedicated to tracking and combating human trafficking.  There, she created a database of foreign national law on involuntary servitude, slavery, trafficking in persons and related issues. In 1998 Lederer oversaw the project's transition to the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]], where she remained for three years (1998 \u2013 2001). A core component of this work centered on the publication of the first Human Rights Report on Trafficking in Persons, a document pre-dating the U.S. government TIP Report that tracked and evaluated in 194 countries the global routes, patterns, and trends in human trafficking as well as laws, law enforcement, and case law addressing it.<ref name=protectionproject/>\n\nDuring the drafting of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, from 1998 to 2000, she served as a witness in [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] and [[House International Relations Committee]] hearings held by Representatives [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] and [[Sam Gejdenson]] and the late Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] and Senator [[Sam Brownback]], testifying on the global nature and scope of the problem of trafficking in persons.<ref>[[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|Helsinki Commission]] Hearing, U.S. House of Representatives, June 28, 1999.</ref> She was instrumental in bringing trafficking victims from over a dozen countries to testify in Congress.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In 1998, she also helped bring together a new bi-partisan anti-trafficking coalition of women's groups and faith-based groups. This coalition played a role in the passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.<ref>Allen Hertzke, Freeing God's Children, Rowand & Littlefield, 2004</ref>\n\n===Senior Advisor on Human Trafficking (2001\u20132009)===\nIn 2001, as Deputy Senior Advisor to the [[Secretary of State]] she helped set up the [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] at the [[U.S. Department of State]]. In From 2002\u20132009, she served as Senior Advisor on Trafficking in Persons to Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs, [[Paula J. Dobriansky]].

For the past few years I have been calling human trafficking ... a contemporary form of slavery.  When I first made the comparison, I took some heat.  Critics said that \"slavery\" was too strong a term. That it referenced a particular period in our country's history ... that true slavery doesn't exist today. [However] as I examined it further, I became convinced that the comparison was apt.  In a previous century, Africans labored in the tobacco fields, and slaves were bred for strength and endurance.  The fields have been replaced by brothels and sex shops, and the new trade is in young women and children. Yet even with these changes, the similarities are striking:\n*As were African slaves, these young women are tricked, deceived, lured, induced, kidnapped, and coerced into bondage.\n*They are taken from their native homelands and moved vast distances to foreign countries.\n*In these new places, they do not know the language, the culture, the laws.  They are separated from family and friends.  They have no identification papers, no passports, no visas. Strangers in a strange land, they have no way to escape.\n*As were slaves of earlier times, they are under the complete control of the people who have enslaved them. If they don't do what they are told, they are held without food or water, beaten and raped, their families threatened.\n*And perhaps most important, as were the slaves of earlier times, they are forced to do someone else's bidding for someone else's financial gain.<ref>\"Human Trafficking and the Law,\" speech at The Library of Congress, May 1, 2001 (Law Day)</ref></blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>Unlike drugs ... human beings can be sold over and over again. ... The problem has always been marginalized, but it is so great that it can't be ignored any longer.<ref>Press Conference, Senator Paul Wellstone, June 20, 1999, quoted in Washington Times</ref></blockquote>\n----\n\n<blockquote>We started by bringing trafficking victims from Russia, the Ukraine, Nepal, India, and Mexico to the U.S. House and Senate to testify at Congressional hearings, because we knew that if American citizens heard their terrible stories we would be successful in passing a new law.  We organized education and awareness campaigns on sex trafficking and labor trafficking in the U.S. and abroad.  And, perhaps most important, we dared to challenge a subtext in the mainstream human rights movement, a subtext that said, \"If we can only get  AIDS, STDs, violence, exploitation and rape, drug addiction and drug trafficking, international organized crime and other horrible elements out of prostitution, then it could be a legitimate career option for young women.<ref>Speech, Association of Evangelical Relief and Development Organizations, October 18, 2001</ref></blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>In addition to the three Ps (Prevention, Prosecution, and Protection) we also need the four Rs:  rescue, rehabilitation, restoration, and reintegration.<ref>HHS Seminar of Survivor-Led Service Providers, [date]</ref></blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>Human trafficking ... must be fought on three fronts: Supply, demand, distribution. You have to address all three at one time instead of just one or the other. Preventive campaigns without  interdiction, without the high penalties that make it high risk, will not work. Likewise, it is important to address the demand side: the customers who purchase trafficked humans. There is explosive growth of child prostitution worldwide, often linked to trafficking.  [T]he phenomenon is fueled by Western demand, and the U.S. increasingly is addressing demand.<ref>The Yale Globalist, March 1, 2004</ref></blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>Victims of trafficking often endure brutal conditions that result in serious physical and mental health problems.  These include HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as other serious communicable diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis.   Rape, assault, battery, and other forms of violence are also common.  Victims of human trafficking also have reproductive problems such as [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], forced abortion, and/or abortion related complications.  Unwanted pregnancies are common.  Many trafficking victims become addicted to [[ethanol|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s, used to numb the physical pain of  long-standing abuse.  Finally, the health implications of sex trafficking extend not only to victims and their children, but also to the customers/users, who can be infected or become carriers and transmitters of these diseases.  In the U.S., victims are being trafficked from countries as disparate as India, Thailand, Russia, Cameroon, Mexico, Honduras, and many more.  Most often, they are from resource poor countries with more than their share of serious health problems.  Some of these countries have a thriving sex industry make them epicenters for epidemics.  And  where people are being moved vast distances around the globe to do someone else's bidding for someone else's gain, the epidemics are moving with them, thereby having a direct impact on the health of the destination country.</blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>Media reports would have us believe that commercial sexual exploitation is confined to a few poor regions of the world. But new evidence demonstrates that every country, rich or poor, North or South, produces its own child sexual abusers. Laws and law enforcement to prevent child sexual exploitation are hopelessly inadequate.  Around the world, the definition of a child varies so widely as to make it impossible to have a cooperative effort protecting children from sexual exploitation. In Tanzania and the Philippines, the age of majority is 12; in a dozen other countries, it is 14: over 100 countries set the age of majority at 18. But these same countries have variations on age of consent to sexual relations.  Thus, what may be illegal sexual relations or statutory rape in England may be legal in a Southeast Asian country. A country that prohibits child prostitution but makes the age of majority 12 has no protection for a teenage child targeted by an adult exploiter. . Countries must examine their definitions of child and the age of consent for sexual relations. As much as possible, nations should regularize these definitions, taking into account what we already know about the universal physical, psychological and emotional development of a human being. Only an international campaign can make cooperation among law enforcement agencies feasible.\"<ref>National Catholic Reporter,  November 12, 1996</ref></blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>Survivors have a great deal to offer in the realm of anti-trafficking work.  They are the ones who have real-life experience with trafficking. They have a knowledge and expertise that cannot be gained from any textbook or course of training.  We need to make our programs more survivor-centered, not out of pity for the survivors, but because every aspect of our programs, whether prevention, prosecution, or protection, will be strengthened, and ultimately more successful, if we do incorporate survivors.  For example:\n* was a survivor who traced the trafficking routes in one of the first sex trafficking cases in the U.S. She identified the small town in Mexico where the recruiting took place, described the four-day walk through the Mexican desert and across the Rio Grande, told of the houses in transit cities where the traffickers harbored them, and identified the series of trailer brothels in a small rural town in Florida where she and many other young women and children were forced into prostitution through violence, threats, and intimidation.  This intelligence was critical in designing interventions tailored to the problem.  It could not be readily obtained in any other way.\n*It was a survivor in India who returned to her trafficker with a group of anti-trafficking law enforcement officials, and led them to the brothel to which she was trafficked when she was 11, to show us the hollow wall behind which children were hidden whenever there were raids, resulting in the rescue of some fifteen more children that day.\n*It is survivors who have designed the most successful rehabilitation programs for other survivors.  Why?  Because they know in intimate detail the physical and mental hell of slavery and can therefore shape programs that hit the mark, both for emergency shelters when victims are first rescued, and for longer term employment and education programs that can help people learn new skills for survival.<ref>Speech, Florida State Coalition Against Trafficking, 2008</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Publications ==\n*Editor and contributor, \"[[Take Back the Night: Women on Pornography]]\", published in 1980 by William and Morrow.\n*Editor, ''The Price We Pay: The Case Against Racist Speech, Hate Propaganda, and Pornography'', published by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] in 1995.\n*Author, \"Where have all the young girls gone?

In 1977 she helped found and then directed the first women's anti-pornography organization in the country.  Also in 1977, became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. She founded and directed The Protection Project, a legal research and human rights institute at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1997.  There, she collected and translated foreign national law on involuntary servitude, slavery, trafficking in persons and related issues and created an international database housing over 3,000 statutes from 190 countries. She also tracked global routes, patterns, and trends in human trafficking and published the first Human Rights Report on Trafficking in Persons. In 2000, she moved The Protection Project to Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), where it is housed today.\n\nDuring the drafting of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, from 1998 to 2000, she served as a witness in hearings held by Representatives Chris Smith and Sam Gjendenson in the House of Representatives International Subcommittee on Human Rights and the late Senator Paul Wellstone and Sam Brownback in the Senate, testifying on the global nature and scope of the problem of trafficking in persons. She brought trafficking victims from over a dozen countries to testify in Congress. In 1998, she also played a vital role in bringing together a new bi-partisan anti-trafficking coalition of women's groups such as Equality Now, and faith-based groups such as The Salvation Army, and the National Association of Evangelicals. This coalition played an important role in the passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.\n\nIn 2001, as Deputy Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State she helped stand up the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at the U.S. Department of State. In From 2002 \u2013 2007, she served as Senior Advisor on Trafficking in Persons to Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs, Paula J. Dobriansky. In that capacity she advised the Under Secretary on policy formulation and development, program creation and implementation, and long-range planning for the Office for Global Affairs. She represented the Under Secretary at high-level national and international meetings, spoke extensively as a recognized expert at governmental, inter-governmental, non-governmental, academic and other conferences, seminars, and meetings.  She also advised the Ambassador-at-Large on Trafficking in Persons and other key governmental officials, as well as serving as liaison to civil society.\n\n===Current career===\n\nCurrently Laura Lederer is affiliated with the anti-trafficking NGOs [[Global Centurion]] and [[Triple S Network]].\n\nShe is also an Adjunct Professor of Law at Georgetown Law Center where teaches (with Professor Mohamad Mattar) a course entitled, \"International Trafficking in Persons,\" a JD/LLM class that covers  U.S federal and state law on human trafficking; foreign national anti-trafficking law; and international instruments addressing human trafficking. The course also examines the global scope of the trafficking problem including trafficking routes and patterns; the similarities and differences between sex and labor trafficking; the relationship of human trafficking to drug and arms trafficking; trafficking and terrorism; the public health implications of trafficking; child sex tourism; trafficking and international migration; transnational issues in trafficking such as international peacekeeping, corruption, money-laundering, international adoption, and more.\n\n== Anti-Pornography Activism (1976\u20131981) ==\nIn late 1976, she accompanied a friend to a [[San Francisco]] conference on [[violence against women]]. A display at the conference included images from magazine [[advertising]], [[softcore pornography]], and [[hardcore pornography]], including [[child pornography]]. Lederer stated in a later interview: \"You saw the influence of the really hard-core images, back through the soft-core to the mainstream. Images were repeated. That's how I got involved. It kind of clicked.\"<ref name=simpson/>{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|p=136}} Several participants in the conference proposed to keep meeting and form an organization devoted to protesting violent images of women. In January 1977, this organization was started, which after several name changes became [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]] (WAVPM). Lederer signed on as the organization's national coordinator and editor of its newsletter.{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\nAs coordinator of WAVPM, Lederer helped organize protests and [[boycotts]] against companies such as [[Max Factor]] and [[Finnair]] whose advertising the organization felt encouraged violence against women.{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|pp=134\u2013135, 146\u2013148}} She also organized educational tours of pornographic businesses in San Francisco's [[red light districts]], a tactic later emulated by [[Women Against Pornography]].{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|p=142}} Lederer worked closely with then-[[San Francisco Board of Supervisors|Supervisor]] [[Dianne Feinstein]] on a San Francisco anti-pornography zoning ordinance targeting sex-related businesses. Lederer was aided in this effort by the fact that her father, in the role of Building Commissioner in Detroit, had worked vigorously for shaping and enforcing a similar zoning ordinance in that city. Lederer traveled to Detroit to research the ordinance there, and passed the results along to Feinstein. Though the zoning ordinance faced stiff opposition (notably from the San Francisco [[ACLU]] and from [[Harvey Milk]]), a milder version of this ordinance was passed in 1978.<ref>{{harvnb|Bronstein|2011|pp=210, 237}}, {{harvnb|Sides|2006|pp=370\u2013374}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1978, Lederer brought on Lynn Campbell to help organize WAVPM and together they helped organize Feminist Perspectives on Pornography, the first national [[anti-pornography]] feminist conference held in San Francisco on November 17\u201319, 1978. The conference drew many well known feminist speakers, notably [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Phyllis Chesler]], [[Kathleen Barry]], [[Susan Brownmiller]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]]. This conference was significant in that it served as a galvanizing event for the anti-pornography feminist movement in the United States. The final event of the conference was the first [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] march, which converged on the Broadway red light district.{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|pp=157\u2013169}} The talks given during the event were later collected in the [[anthology]] ''[[Take Back the Night: Women on Pornography|Take Back the Night]]''\u2014a work which was compiled and edited by Lederer and would go on to stand as a key document in the emerging feminist anti-pornography movement.{{sfn|Bronstein|2011|p=137}}\n\n== Anti-Human Trafficking Work ==\n\n===Early Anti-Human Trafficking Work (1993\u20132001)===\nIn 1994, Lederer founded The Protection Project, a legal research institute dedicated to tracking and combating human trafficking.  There, she created a database of foreign national law on involuntary servitude, slavery, trafficking in persons and related issues. In 1998 Lederer oversaw the project's transition to the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]], where she remained for three years (1998 \u2013 2001). A core component of this work centered on the publication of the first Human Rights Report on Trafficking in Persons, a document pre-dating the U.S. government TIP Report that tracked and evaluated in 194 countries the global routes, patterns, and trends in human trafficking as well as laws, law enforcement, and case law addressing it.<ref name=protectionproject/>\n\nDuring the drafting of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, from 1998 to 2000, she served as a witness in [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] and [[House International Relations Committee]] hearings held by Representatives [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] and [[Sam Gejdenson]] and the late Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] and Senator [[Sam Brownback]], testifying on the global nature and scope of the problem of trafficking in persons.<ref>[[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|Helsinki Commission]] Hearing, U.S. House of Representatives, June 28, 1999.</ref> She was instrumental in bringing trafficking victims from over a dozen countries to testify in Congress.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In 1998, she also helped bring together a new bi-partisan anti-trafficking coalition of women's groups and faith-based groups.

For the past few years I have been calling human trafficking ... a contemporary form of slavery.  When I first made the comparison, I took some heat.  Critics said that \"slavery\" was too strong a term. That it referenced a particular period in our country's history ... that true slavery doesn't exist today. [However] as I examined it further, I became convinced that the comparison was apt.  In a previous century, Africans labored in the tobacco fields, and slaves were bred for strength and endurance.  The fields have been replaced by brothels and sex shops, and the new trade is in young women and children. Yet even with these changes, the similarities are striking:\n*As were African slaves, these young women are tricked, deceived, lured, induced, kidnapped, and coerced into bondage.\n*They are taken from their native homelands and moved vast distances to foreign countries.\n*In these new places, they do not know the language, the culture, the laws.  They are separated from family and friends.  They have no identification papers, no passports, no visas. Strangers in a strange land, they have no way to escape.\n*As were slaves of earlier times, they are under the complete control of the people who have enslaved them. If they don't do what they are told, they are held without food or water, beaten and raped, their families threatened.\n*And perhaps most important, as were the slaves of earlier times, they are forced to do someone else's bidding for someone else's financial gain.<ref>\"Human Trafficking and the Law,\" speech at The Library of Congress, May 1, 2001 (Law Day)</ref></blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>Unlike drugs ... human beings can be sold over and over again. ... The problem has always been marginalized, but it is so great that it can't be ignored any longer.<ref>Press Conference, Senator Paul Wellstone, June 20, 1999, quoted in Washington Times</ref></blockquote>\n----\n\n<blockquote>We started by bringing trafficking victims from Russia, the Ukraine, Nepal, India, and Mexico to the U.S. House and Senate to testify at Congressional hearings, because we knew that if American citizens heard their terrible stories we would be successful in passing a new law.  We organized education and awareness campaigns on sex trafficking and labor trafficking in the U.S. and abroad.  And, perhaps most important, we dared to challenge a subtext in the mainstream human rights movement, a subtext that said, \"If we can only get  AIDS, STDs, violence, exploitation and rape, drug addiction and drug trafficking, international organized crime and other horrible elements out of prostitution, then it could be a legitimate career option for young women.<ref>Speech, Association of Evangelical Relief and Development Organizations, October 18, 2001</ref></blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>In addition to the three Ps (Prevention, Prosecution, and Protection) we also need the four Rs:  rescue, rehabilitation, restoration, and reintegration.<ref>HHS Seminar of Survivor-Led Service Providers, [date]</ref></blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>Human trafficking ... must be fought on three fronts: Supply, demand, distribution. You have to address all three at one time instead of just one or the other. Preventive campaigns without  interdiction, without the high penalties that make it high risk, will not work. Likewise, it is important to address the demand side: the customers who purchase trafficked humans. There is explosive growth of child prostitution worldwide, often linked to trafficking.  [T]he phenomenon is fueled by Western demand, and the U.S. increasingly is addressing demand.<ref>The Yale Globalist, March 1, 2004</ref></blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>Victims of trafficking often endure brutal conditions that result in serious physical and mental health problems.  These include HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as other serious communicable diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis.   Rape, assault, battery, and other forms of violence are also common.  Victims of human trafficking also have reproductive problems such as [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], forced abortion, and/or abortion related complications.  Unwanted pregnancies are common.  Many trafficking victims become addicted to [[ethanol|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s, used to numb the physical pain of  long-standing abuse.  Finally, the health implications of sex trafficking extend not only to victims and their children, but also to the customers/users, who can be infected or become carriers and transmitters of these diseases.  In the U.S., victims are being trafficked from countries as disparate as India, Thailand, Russia, Cameroon, Mexico, Honduras, and many more.  Most often, they are from resource poor countries with more than their share of serious health problems.  Some of these countries have a thriving sex industry make them epicenters for epidemics.  And  where people are being moved vast distances around the globe to do someone else's bidding for someone else's gain, the epidemics are moving with them, thereby having a direct impact on the health of the destination country.</blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>Media reports would have us believe that commercial sexual exploitation is confined to a few poor regions of the world. But new evidence demonstrates that every country, rich or poor, North or South, produces its own child sexual abusers. Laws and law enforcement to prevent child sexual exploitation are hopelessly inadequate.  Around the world, the definition of a child varies so widely as to make it impossible to have a cooperative effort protecting children from sexual exploitation. In Tanzania and the Philippines, the age of majority is 12; in a dozen other countries, it is 14: over 100 countries set the age of majority at 18. But these same countries have variations on age of consent to sexual relations.  Thus, what may be illegal sexual relations or statutory rape in England may be legal in a Southeast Asian country. A country that prohibits child prostitution but makes the age of majority 12 has no protection for a teenage child targeted by an adult exploiter. . Countries must examine their definitions of child and the age of consent for sexual relations. As much as possible, nations should regularize these definitions, taking into account what we already know about the universal physical, psychological and emotional development of a human being. Only an international campaign can make cooperation among law enforcement agencies feasible.\"<ref>National Catholic Reporter,  November 12, 1996</ref></blockquote>\n\n----\n<blockquote>Survivors have a great deal to offer in the realm of anti-trafficking work.  They are the ones who have real-life experience with trafficking. They have a knowledge and expertise that cannot be gained from any textbook or course of training.  We need to make our programs more survivor-centered, not out of pity for the survivors, but because every aspect of our programs, whether prevention, prosecution, or protection, will be strengthened, and ultimately more successful, if we do incorporate survivors.  For example:\n* was a survivor who traced the trafficking routes in one of the first sex trafficking cases in the U.S. She identified the small town in Mexico where the recruiting took place, described the four-day walk through the Mexican desert and across the Rio Grande, told of the houses in transit cities where the traffickers harbored them, and identified the series of trailer brothels in a small rural town in Florida where she and many other young women and children were forced into prostitution through violence, threats, and intimidation.  This intelligence was critical in designing interventions tailored to the problem.  It could not be readily obtained in any other way.\n*It was a survivor in India who returned to her trafficker with a group of anti-trafficking law enforcement officials, and led them to the brothel to which she was trafficked when she was 11, to show us the hollow wall behind which children were hidden whenever there were raids, resulting in the rescue of some fifteen more children that day.\n*It is survivors who have designed the most successful rehabilitation programs for other survivors.  Why?  Because they know in intimate detail the physical and mental hell of slavery and can therefore shape programs that hit the mark, both for emergency shelters when victims are first rescued, and for longer term employment and education programs that can help people learn new skills for survival.<ref>Speech, Florida State Coalition Against Trafficking, 2008</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Publications ==\n*Editor and contributor, \"[[Take Back the Night: Women on Pornography]]\", published in 1980 by William and Morrow.\n*Editor, ''The Price We Pay: The Case Against Racist Speech, Hate Propaganda, and Pornography'', published by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] in 1995.\n*Author, \"Where have all the young girls gone?

A context-specific line is used in a conversation within the middle of the game, wherein [[Fable II#Characters|Hammer]] asks if the protagonist was able to convince their partner, wife, or husband to wait for them when they must go away for ten years. The game also includes a quest in which the player character finds a suitable partner for a farmer's son who hints at being gay. The farmer is surprised but accepts that his son is gay and was unable to find an acceptable partner because the father had previously presented him only with female suitors. [[Fable II#Characters|Reaver]], the NPC known as the Hero of Skill, is bisexual, known to have [[polyamory|simultaneous lovers]] named Ursula, Penelope, and Andrew.\n\nIn ''Fable III'' (2010), once again there are more lesbian, gay, and bisexual NPC townspeople to court and marry.

Such options were added in later patches after considerable backlash from fans, many of whom noted that the lack of diversity flew in the face of BioWare's previous record. The 2013 expansion ''Rise of the Hutt Cartel'' features a same-sex flirtation option for both factions (a lesbian for the Republic and a gay male for the Empire). 2014's ''Shadow of Revan'' introduces Republic agent Theron Shan and the [[Sith lord]] Lana Beniko, both of whom will react favorably to the advances of a player of either gender (and either faction). The 2015 expansion ''Knights of the Fallen Empire'' sees the return of Shan and Beniko, and introduces Koth Vortena; all three are fully realized romance options for characters male or female characters.

In these works Hubbard claimed that the source of all psychological pain, and therefore the cause of mental and physical health problems, was a form of memory known as \"[[Engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]\". According to Hubbard, individuals could reach a state he named \"[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]\" in which a person was freed of these engrams. This would be done by talking with an \"[[Auditing (Scientology)|auditor]]\".<ref name=dayinhistory/>\n\nWhile not accepted by the medical and scientific establishment, in the first two years of its publication, over 100,000 copies of the book were sold. Many enthusiasts emerged to form groups to study and practice Dianetics. The atmosphere from which Dianetics was written about in this period was one of \"excited experimentation\".

It was the craze of 1950-51, but the fad was dead by 1952.  Most people read the book, tried it out, then put it down.  The remaining practitioners had no ties to the Foundation and resisted its control.  Because there were no trained Dianetics professionals, factions formed.  The followers challenged Hubbard's movement and his authority.  Wallis suggests Hubbard learned an implicit lesson from this experience.  He would not make the same mistake when creating Scientology.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wallis |first1=Roy |title=\"Poor Man's Psychoanalysis?\" Observations on Dianetics |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer|The Zetetic]] |date=1976 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201324 |ref=zetetic-1-1}}</ref>\n \nHubbard left the Foundation, which shut down.

A basic idea in Dianetics is that the mind consists of two parts: the \"analytical mind\" and the \"[[reactive mind]].\" The \"reactive mind\", the mind which operates when a person is physically unconscious, acts as a record of shock, trauma, pain, and otherwise harmful memories. Experiences such as these, stored in the \"reactive mind\" are dubbed \"[[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]\". Dianetics is proposed as a method to erase these engrams in the reactive mind to achieve a state of [[Clear (Scientology)|clear]].<ref name=\"James R. Lewis 1997, page 287\"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Pat | year = 1971 | title = Scientology and Dianetics | journal = The Journal of Education | volume = 153 | issue = 4| pages = 58\u201361 | jstor=42773008}}</ref>\n\nHubbard described Dianetics as \"an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of [[natural law]]s on the order of those of the physical sciences\".<ref>Winter, J.A. ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 18 (Julian Press, 1987 reprint)</ref> In April 1950, before the public release of Dianetics, he wrote: \"To date, over two hundred patients have been treated; of those two hundred, two hundred cures have been obtained.\"<ref>Hubbard, \"Dianetics\". ''Astounding Science Fiction'', May 1950.</ref>\n\nIn Dianetics, the unconscious or reactive mind is described as a collection of \"mental image pictures,\" which contain the recorded experience of past moments of unconsciousness, including all sensory perceptions and feelings involved, ranging from [[pre-natal]] experiences, infancy and childhood, to even the traumatic feelings associated with events from past lives and extraterrestrial cultures. The type of mental image picture created during a period of [[unconsciousness]] involves the exact recording of a painful experience. Hubbard called this phenomenon an [[engram (Dianetics)|engram]], and defined it as \"a complete recording of a moment of unconsciousness containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions.\"<ref>[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]] page 79 and Glossary</ref>\n\nHubbard proposed that painful physical or emotional traumas caused \"aberrations\" (deviations from rational thinking) in the mind, which produced lasting adverse physical and emotional effects, similar to [[conversion disorders]]. When the analytical (conscious) mind shut down during these moments, events and perceptions of this period were stored as engrams in the unconscious or reactive mind.  (In Hubbard's earliest publications on the subject, engrams were variously referred to as \"Norns\",<ref name=\"Creation\"/> \"Impediments,\" and \"comanomes\" before \"engram\" was adapted from its existing usage at the suggestion of Joseph Augustus Winter, MD.)<ref name=\"Blue Sky\">{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = A Piece of Blue Sky | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-8184-0499-3 | page = [https://archive.org/details/pieceofblueskysc00atac/page/109 109] | url = https://archive.org/details/pieceofblueskysc00atac/page/109 }}</ref> Some commentators noted Dianetics's blend of science fiction and [[occult]] orientations at the time.<ref name=\"Creation\"/>\n\nHubbard claimed that these engrams are the cause of almost all psychological and physical problems. In addition to physical pain, engrams could include words or phrases spoken in the vicinity while the patient was unconscious. For instance, Winter cites the example of a patient with a persistent headache supposedly tracing the problem to a doctor saying, \"Take him now,\" during the patient's birth.<ref>Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 165</ref>  Hubbard similarly claimed that [[leukemia]] is traceable to \"an engram containing the phrase 'It turns my blood to water.'\"<ref>Hubbard, ''A History of Man'', p.20. American Saint Hill Organization, 1968</ref>  While it is sometimes claimed that the Church of Scientology no longer stands by Hubbard's claims that Dianetics can treat physical conditions, it still publishes them:  \"... when the knee injuries of the past are located and discharged, the [[arthritis]] ceases, no other injury takes its place and the person is finished with arthritis of the knee.\"<ref>Hubbard, L.

Basic concepts, including [[conversion disorder]], are derived from [[Sigmund Freud]], whom Hubbard credited as an inspiration and source.<ref>Letter from John W. Campbell, cited in Winter, p. 3 - \"His approach is, actually, based on some very early work of Freud\"</ref> Freud had speculated 40 years previously that traumas with similar content join together in \"chains,\" embedded in the unconscious mind, to cause irrational responses in the individual. Such a chain would be relieved by inducing the patient to remember the earliest trauma, \"with an accompanying expression of emotion.\"<ref>Joseph Breuer and Sigmund Freud, \"Studies in Hysteria\", Vol II of the ''Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''.

Ron Hubbard ''A Critique of Psychoanalysis'', PAB 92, 10 July 1956.</ref>\n\nAccording to Bent Corydon, Hubbard created the illusion that Dianetics was the first [[psychotherapy]] to address [[traumatic experience]]s in their own time, but others had done so as standard procedure.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130613033101/http://anonireland.com/content/wppdfcontent/books/messiahormadmen.pdf</ref>\n\nOne treatment method Hubbard drew from in developing Dianetics was [[abreaction therapy]].  [[Abreaction]] is a [[psychoanalytical]] [[technical terminology|term]] that means bringing to [[consciousness]], and thus adequate expression, material that has been unconscious. \"It includes not only the recollection of forgotten memories and [[experience]], but also their reliving with appropriate emotional display and discharge of effect. This process is usually facilitated by the patient's gaining awareness of the [[causal relationship]] between the previously undischarged [[emotion]] and his [[symptom]]s.\"<ref>Bent Corydon ''L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?'', pp. 283-4, Barricade Books Inc., 1992 {{ISBN|0-942637-57-7}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hubbard, before Dianetics psychotherapists had dealt with very light and superficial incidents (e.g. an incident that reminds the patient of a moment of loss), but with Dianetic therapy, the patient could actually erase moments of pain and unconsciousness. He emphasized: \"The discovery of the engram is entirely the property of Dianetics. Methods of its erasure are also owned entirely by Dianetics...\"<ref>''A Critique of Psychoanalysis'', ibid.

The central technique was \"auditing,\" a two-person [[talk therapy|question-and-answer therapy]] designed to isolate and dissipate engrams (or \"mental masses\"). An auditor addresses questions to a subject, observes and records the subject's responses, and returns repeatedly to experiences or areas under discussion that appear painful until the troubling experience has been identified and confronted. Through repeated applications of this method, the reactive mind could be \"cleared\" of its content having outlived its usefulness in the [[Process (science)|process]] of [[evolution]]; a person who has completed this process would be \"Clear\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Wright |first1=Lawrence |title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief |url=https://books.google.com/?id=z4IDPV2hZL0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=l.+ron+hubbard+dianetics+reactive+mind+clear#v=onepage&q=reactive%20mind&f=false |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2013 |isbn=9780385350273 |accessdate=2016-01-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe benefits of going Clear, according to Hubbard, were dramatic. A Clear would have no compulsions, repressions, [[psychosis|psychoses]] or [[neurosis|neuroses]], and would enjoy a near-perfect memory as well as a rise in [[IQ]] of as much as 50 points. He also claimed that \"the atheist is activated by engrams as thoroughly as the zealot\".<ref>Hubbard, \"Dianetics and Religion,\" ''Dianetic Auditor's Bulletin'' vol. 1 no. 4, October 1950</ref> He further claimed that widespread application of Dianetics would result in \"A world without [[insanity]], without criminals and without war.\"<ref>Hubbard, ''Science of Survival: Prediction of Human Behavior'' p. 1, Bridge Publications, 1990 (reissue).</ref>\n\nOne of the key ideas of Dianetics, according to Hubbard, is the fundamental existential command to survive. According to Hugh B. Urban, this would serve as the foundation of a big part of later Scientology.<ref>{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |url=https://archive.org/details/churchofscientol0000urba |url-access=registration |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=22 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Scientology journal ''The Auditor'', the total number of \"Clears\" as of May 2006 stands at 50,311.<ref>\"The Auditor,\" The Monthly Journal of Scientology, published by the American Saint Hill Organization, 1413 L. Ron Hubbard Way, Los Angeles, CA 90027, Issue 330, May 2006, page 7.</ref>\n\n==Procedure in practice==\n[[File:Dianetics demo at Union Station.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Scientologist]]s promoting Dianetics at [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] in Washington, D.C.]]\nThe procedure of Dianetics therapy (known as ''auditing'') is a two-person activity. One person, the \"auditor\", guides the other person, the \"pre-clear\". The pre-Clear's job is to look at the mind and talk to the auditor. The auditor acknowledges what the pre-Clear says and controls the process so the pre-Clear may put his full attention on his work.\n\nThe auditor and pre-Clear sit down in chairs facing each other. The process then follows in eleven distinct steps:<ref>This description is based on \"[http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/dianetics-auditing-steps.html The Dianetics Procedure - 10 Simple Steps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030226223940/http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/dianetics-auditing-steps.html |date=26 February 2003 }}\"</ref>\n\n*1. The auditor assures the pre-Clear that he will be fully aware of everything that happens during the session.\n*2. The pre-Clear is instructed to close his eyes for the session, entering a state of \"dianetic reverie\", signified by \"a tremble of the lashes\". During the session, the preclear remains in full possession of his will and retains full recall thereafter.\n*3. The auditor installs a \"canceller\", an instruction intended to absolutely cancel any form of positive suggestion that could accidentally occur. This is done by saying \"In the future, when I utter the word 'cancelled,' everything I have said to you while you are in a therapy session will be cancelled and will have no force with you. Any suggestion I may have made to you will be without force when I say the word 'cancelled.' Do you understand?\"\n*4. The auditor then asks the pre-Clear to locate an exact record of something that happened to the pre-Clear in his past: \"Locate an incident that you feel you can comfortably face.\"\n*5. The pre-Clear is invited by the auditor to \"Go through the incident and say what is happening as you go along.\"\n*6a. The auditor instructs the pre-Clear to recall as much as possible of the incident, going over it several times \"until the pre-Clear is cheerful about it\".\n*6b. When the pre-Clear is cheerful about an incident, the auditor instructs the pre-Clear to locate another incident: \"Let's find another incident that you feel you can comfortably face.\" The process outlined at steps 5 and 6a then repeats until the auditing session's time limit (usually two hours or so) is reached.\n*7. The pre-Clear is then instructed to \"return to present time\".\n*8. The auditor checks to make sure that the pre-Clear feels himself to be in \"present time\", i.e., not still recalling a past incident.\n*9. The auditor gives the pre-Clear the canceller word: \"Very good. Cancelled.\"\n*10. The auditor tells the pre-Clear to feel alert and return to full awareness of his surroundings: \"When I count from five to one and snap my fingers you will feel alert. Five, four, three, two, one.\" (snaps fingers)\n\nAuditing sessions are supposedly kept confidential. A few transcripts of auditing sessions with [[Sanitization (classified information)|confidential information removed]] have been published as demonstration examples. Some extracts can be found in J.A. Winter's book ''[[Dianetics: A Doctor's Report]]''. Other, more comprehensive, transcripts of auditing sessions carried out by Hubbard himself can be found in volume 1 of the ''Research & Discovery Series'' (Bridge Publications, 1980). Examples of public group processing sessions can be found throughout the ''Congresses'' lecture series.\n\nAccording to Hubbard, auditing enables the pre-Clear to \"contact\" and \"release\" engrams stored in the reactive mind, relieving him of the physical and mental aberrations connected with them. The pre-Clear is asked to inspect and familiarize himself with the exact details of his own experience; the auditor may not tell him anything about his case or evaluate any of the information the pre-Clear finds.\n\n==Therapeutic claims==\n\nIn August 1950, amidst the success of ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics]]'', Hubbard held a demonstration in Los Angeles' [[Shrine Auditorium]] where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianca (a pseudonym) to a large audience including many reporters and photographers as 'the world's first [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]].\"  Despite Hubbard's claim that she had \"full and perfect recall of every moment of her life\", Bianca proved unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities, including the question of the color of Hubbard's tie.  Hubbard explained Bianca's failure to display her promised powers of recall to the audience by saying that he had used the word \"now\" in calling her to the stage, and thus inadvertently froze her in \"present time,\" which blocked her abilities.<ref>{{cite book|first=Russell|last=Miller|title=Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L.

It presents case histories and a number of [[X-ray]] plates to support claims that Dianetics had cured \"aberrations\" including [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], asthma, [[arthritis]], [[colitis]] and \"overt homosexuality,\" and that after Dianetic processing, test subjects experienced significantly increased scores on a standardized IQ test. The report's subjects are not identified by name, but one of them is clearly Hubbard himself (\"Case 1080A, R. L.\").<ref>Benton, Peggy; Ibanex, Dalmyra.; Southon, Gordon; Southon, Peggy.

Critics of Dianetics are skeptical of this study, both because of the bias of the source and because the researchers appear to ascribe all physical benefits to Dianetics without considering possible outside factors; in other words, the report lacks any [[scientific control]]s. J.A. Winter, M.D., originally an associate of Hubbard and an early adopter of Dianetics, had by the end of 1950 cut his ties with Hubbard and written an account of his personal experiences with Dianetics. He described Hubbard as \"absolutistic and authoritarian\",<ref name=departure/> and criticized the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for failing to undertake \"precise scientific research into the functioning of the mind\".<ref>Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 40</ref> He also recommended that auditing be done by experts only and that it was dangerous for laymen to audit each other.<ref name=departure>{{cite news | title = Departure in Dianetics | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821638,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 3 September 1951 | accessdate = 14 February 2008 }}</ref> Hubbard writes: \"Again, Dianetics is not being released to a profession, for no profession could encompass it.\"<ref>L.

Professor [[John Alan Lee|John A. Lee]] states in his 1970 evaluation of Dianetics:\n\n{{quote|Objective experimental verification of Hubbard's [[physiology|physiological]] and psychological doctrines is lacking. To date, no regular scientific agency has established the validity of his theories of prenatal perception and engrams, or cellular memory, or Dianetic reverie, or the effects of Scientology auditing routines.

''Sectarian Healers and Hypnotherapy'', 1970, Ontario</ref>}}\n\nThe [[MEDLINE]] database records two independent scientific studies on Dianetics, both conducted in the 1950s under the auspices of [[New York University]]. Harvey Jay Fischer tested Dianetic therapy against three claims made by proponents and found it does not effect any significant changes in intellectual functioning, mathematical ability, or the degree of personality conflicts;<ref>Fischer, Harvey Jay. \"Dianetic therapy: an experimental evaluation. A statistical analysis of the effect of dianetic therapy as measured by group tests of intelligence, mathematics and personality.\" Abstract of Ph.D. thesis, 1953, New York University ([http://home.snafu.de/tilman/krasel/dianetics_test2.html Excerpt])</ref> Jack Fox tested Hubbard's thesis regarding recall of engrams, with the assistance of the Dianetic Research Foundation, and could not substantiate it.<ref>Fox, J.; Davis, A.E.; Lebovits, B. \"An experimental investigation of Hubbard's engram hypothesis (dianetics)\". ''Psychological Newsletter'', New York University. 10 1959, 131-134</ref>\n\nCommentators from a variety of backgrounds have described Dianetics as an example of pseudoscience. For example, [[philosophy]] professor [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]] points to Dianetics' lack of empirical evidence:\n\n{{quote|What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims. The key elements of Hubbard's so-called science don't seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments. It isn't even clear what such \"data\" would look like. Most of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations ... Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science.<ref>[[Robert Todd Carroll|Carroll, Robert T.]] [http://skepdic.com/dianetic.html \"Dianetics\"], ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''</ref>}}\n\nThe validity and practice of auditing have been questioned by a variety of non-Scientologist commentators. Commenting on the example cited by Winter, the science writer [[Martin Gardner]] asserts that \"nothing could be clearer from the above dialogue than the fact that the dianetic explanation for the headache existed only in the mind of the therapist, and that it was with considerable difficulty that the patient was maneuvered into accepting it.\"<ref>Gardner, Martin. '' Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''. Dover, 1957</ref>\n\nOther critics and medical experts have suggested that Dianetic auditing is a form of [[hypnosis]].<ref>\"Never believe a hypnotist - An investigation of L.

It was the craze of 1950-51, but the fad was dead by 1952.  Most people read the book, tried it out, then put it down.  The remaining practitioners had no ties to the Foundation and resisted its control.  Because there were no trained Dianetics professionals, factions formed.  The followers challenged Hubbard's movement and his authority.  Wallis suggests Hubbard learned an implicit lesson from this experience.  He would not make the same mistake when creating Scientology.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wallis |first1=Roy |title=\"Poor Man's Psychoanalysis?\" Observations on Dianetics |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer|The Zetetic]] |date=1976 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201324 |ref=zetetic-1-1}}</ref>\n \nHubbard left the Foundation, which shut down.

A basic idea in Dianetics is that the mind consists of two parts: the \"analytical mind\" and the \"[[reactive mind]].\" The \"reactive mind\", the mind which operates when a person is physically unconscious, acts as a record of shock, trauma, pain, and otherwise harmful memories. Experiences such as these, stored in the \"reactive mind\" are dubbed \"[[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]\". Dianetics is proposed as a method to erase these engrams in the reactive mind to achieve a state of [[Clear (Scientology)|clear]].<ref name=\"James R. Lewis 1997, page 287\"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Pat | year = 1971 | title = Scientology and Dianetics | journal = The Journal of Education | volume = 153 | issue = 4| pages = 58\u201361 | jstor=42773008}}</ref>\n\nHubbard described Dianetics as \"an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of [[natural law]]s on the order of those of the physical sciences\".<ref>Winter, J.A. ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 18 (Julian Press, 1987 reprint)</ref> In April 1950, before the public release of Dianetics, he wrote: \"To date, over two hundred patients have been treated; of those two hundred, two hundred cures have been obtained.\"<ref>Hubbard, \"Dianetics\". ''Astounding Science Fiction'', May 1950.</ref>\n\nIn Dianetics, the unconscious or reactive mind is described as a collection of \"mental image pictures,\" which contain the recorded experience of past moments of unconsciousness, including all sensory perceptions and feelings involved, ranging from [[pre-natal]] experiences, infancy and childhood, to even the traumatic feelings associated with events from past lives and extraterrestrial cultures. The type of mental image picture created during a period of [[unconsciousness]] involves the exact recording of a painful experience. Hubbard called this phenomenon an [[engram (Dianetics)|engram]], and defined it as \"a complete recording of a moment of unconsciousness containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions.\"<ref>[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]] page 79 and Glossary</ref>\n\nHubbard proposed that painful physical or emotional traumas caused \"aberrations\" (deviations from rational thinking) in the mind, which produced lasting adverse physical and emotional effects, similar to [[conversion disorders]]. When the analytical (conscious) mind shut down during these moments, events and perceptions of this period were stored as engrams in the unconscious or reactive mind.  (In Hubbard's earliest publications on the subject, engrams were variously referred to as \"Norns\",<ref name=\"Creation\"/> \"Impediments,\" and \"comanomes\" before \"engram\" was adapted from its existing usage at the suggestion of Joseph Augustus Winter, MD.)<ref name=\"Blue Sky\">{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = A Piece of Blue Sky | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-8184-0499-3 | page = [https://archive.org/details/pieceofblueskysc00atac/page/109 109] | url = https://archive.org/details/pieceofblueskysc00atac/page/109 }}</ref> Some commentators noted Dianetics's blend of science fiction and [[occult]] orientations at the time.<ref name=\"Creation\"/>\n\nHubbard claimed that these engrams are the cause of almost all psychological and physical problems. In addition to physical pain, engrams could include words or phrases spoken in the vicinity while the patient was unconscious. For instance, Winter cites the example of a patient with a persistent headache supposedly tracing the problem to a doctor saying, \"Take him now,\" during the patient's birth.<ref>Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 165</ref>  Hubbard similarly claimed that [[leukemia]] is traceable to \"an engram containing the phrase 'It turns my blood to water.'\"<ref>Hubbard, ''A History of Man'', p.20. American Saint Hill Organization, 1968</ref>  While it is sometimes claimed that the Church of Scientology no longer stands by Hubbard's claims that Dianetics can treat physical conditions, it still publishes them:  \"... when the knee injuries of the past are located and discharged, the [[arthritis]] ceases, no other injury takes its place and the person is finished with arthritis of the knee.\"<ref>Hubbard, L.

Basic concepts, including [[conversion disorder]], are derived from [[Sigmund Freud]], whom Hubbard credited as an inspiration and source.<ref>Letter from John W. Campbell, cited in Winter, p. 3 - \"His approach is, actually, based on some very early work of Freud\"</ref> Freud had speculated 40 years previously that traumas with similar content join together in \"chains,\" embedded in the unconscious mind, to cause irrational responses in the individual. Such a chain would be relieved by inducing the patient to remember the earliest trauma, \"with an accompanying expression of emotion.\"<ref>Joseph Breuer and Sigmund Freud, \"Studies in Hysteria\", Vol II of the ''Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''.

[[Abreaction]] is a [[psychoanalytical]] [[technical terminology|term]] that means bringing to [[consciousness]], and thus adequate expression, material that has been unconscious. \"It includes not only the recollection of forgotten memories and [[experience]], but also their reliving with appropriate emotional display and discharge of effect. This process is usually facilitated by the patient's gaining awareness of the [[causal relationship]] between the previously undischarged [[emotion]] and his [[symptom]]s.\"<ref>Bent Corydon ''L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?'', pp. 283-4, Barricade Books Inc., 1992 {{ISBN|0-942637-57-7}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hubbard, before Dianetics psychotherapists had dealt with very light and superficial incidents (e.g. an incident that reminds the patient of a moment of loss), but with Dianetic therapy, the patient could actually erase moments of pain and unconsciousness. He emphasized: \"The discovery of the engram is entirely the property of Dianetics. Methods of its erasure are also owned entirely by Dianetics...\"<ref>''A Critique of Psychoanalysis'', ibid.

The central technique was \"auditing,\" a two-person [[talk therapy|question-and-answer therapy]] designed to isolate and dissipate engrams (or \"mental masses\"). An auditor addresses questions to a subject, observes and records the subject's responses, and returns repeatedly to experiences or areas under discussion that appear painful until the troubling experience has been identified and confronted. Through repeated applications of this method, the reactive mind could be \"cleared\" of its content having outlived its usefulness in the [[Process (science)|process]] of [[evolution]]; a person who has completed this process would be \"Clear\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Wright |first1=Lawrence |title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief |url=https://books.google.com/?id=z4IDPV2hZL0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=l.+ron+hubbard+dianetics+reactive+mind+clear#v=onepage&q=reactive%20mind&f=false |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2013 |isbn=9780385350273 |accessdate=2016-01-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe benefits of going Clear, according to Hubbard, were dramatic. A Clear would have no compulsions, repressions, [[psychosis|psychoses]] or [[neurosis|neuroses]], and would enjoy a near-perfect memory as well as a rise in [[IQ]] of as much as 50 points. He also claimed that \"the atheist is activated by engrams as thoroughly as the zealot\".<ref>Hubbard, \"Dianetics and Religion,\" ''Dianetic Auditor's Bulletin'' vol. 1 no. 4, October 1950</ref> He further claimed that widespread application of Dianetics would result in \"A world without [[insanity]], without criminals and without war.\"<ref>Hubbard, ''Science of Survival: Prediction of Human Behavior'' p. 1, Bridge Publications, 1990 (reissue).</ref>\n\nOne of the key ideas of Dianetics, according to Hubbard, is the fundamental existential command to survive. According to Hugh B. Urban, this would serve as the foundation of a big part of later Scientology.<ref>{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |url=https://archive.org/details/churchofscientol0000urba |url-access=registration |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=22 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Scientology journal ''The Auditor'', the total number of \"Clears\" as of May 2006 stands at 50,311.<ref>\"The Auditor,\" The Monthly Journal of Scientology, published by the American Saint Hill Organization, 1413 L. Ron Hubbard Way, Los Angeles, CA 90027, Issue 330, May 2006, page 7.</ref>\n\n==Procedure in practice==\n[[File:Dianetics demo at Union Station.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Scientologist]]s promoting Dianetics at [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] in Washington, D.C.]]\nThe procedure of Dianetics therapy (known as ''auditing'') is a two-person activity. One person, the \"auditor\", guides the other person, the \"pre-clear\". The pre-Clear's job is to look at the mind and talk to the auditor. The auditor acknowledges what the pre-Clear says and controls the process so the pre-Clear may put his full attention on his work.\n\nThe auditor and pre-Clear sit down in chairs facing each other. The process then follows in eleven distinct steps:<ref>This description is based on \"[http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/dianetics-auditing-steps.html The Dianetics Procedure - 10 Simple Steps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030226223940/http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/dianetics-auditing-steps.html |date=26 February 2003 }}\"</ref>\n\n*1. The auditor assures the pre-Clear that he will be fully aware of everything that happens during the session.\n*2. The pre-Clear is instructed to close his eyes for the session, entering a state of \"dianetic reverie\", signified by \"a tremble of the lashes\". During the session, the preclear remains in full possession of his will and retains full recall thereafter.\n*3. The auditor installs a \"canceller\", an instruction intended to absolutely cancel any form of positive suggestion that could accidentally occur. This is done by saying \"In the future, when I utter the word 'cancelled,' everything I have said to you while you are in a therapy session will be cancelled and will have no force with you. Any suggestion I may have made to you will be without force when I say the word 'cancelled.' Do you understand?\"\n*4. The auditor then asks the pre-Clear to locate an exact record of something that happened to the pre-Clear in his past: \"Locate an incident that you feel you can comfortably face.\"\n*5. The pre-Clear is invited by the auditor to \"Go through the incident and say what is happening as you go along.\"\n*6a. The auditor instructs the pre-Clear to recall as much as possible of the incident, going over it several times \"until the pre-Clear is cheerful about it\".\n*6b. When the pre-Clear is cheerful about an incident, the auditor instructs the pre-Clear to locate another incident: \"Let's find another incident that you feel you can comfortably face.\" The process outlined at steps 5 and 6a then repeats until the auditing session's time limit (usually two hours or so) is reached.\n*7. The pre-Clear is then instructed to \"return to present time\".\n*8. The auditor checks to make sure that the pre-Clear feels himself to be in \"present time\", i.e., not still recalling a past incident.\n*9. The auditor gives the pre-Clear the canceller word: \"Very good. Cancelled.\"\n*10. The auditor tells the pre-Clear to feel alert and return to full awareness of his surroundings: \"When I count from five to one and snap my fingers you will feel alert. Five, four, three, two, one.\" (snaps fingers)\n\nAuditing sessions are supposedly kept confidential. A few transcripts of auditing sessions with [[Sanitization (classified information)|confidential information removed]] have been published as demonstration examples. Some extracts can be found in J.A. Winter's book ''[[Dianetics: A Doctor's Report]]''. Other, more comprehensive, transcripts of auditing sessions carried out by Hubbard himself can be found in volume 1 of the ''Research & Discovery Series'' (Bridge Publications, 1980). Examples of public group processing sessions can be found throughout the ''Congresses'' lecture series.\n\nAccording to Hubbard, auditing enables the pre-Clear to \"contact\" and \"release\" engrams stored in the reactive mind, relieving him of the physical and mental aberrations connected with them. The pre-Clear is asked to inspect and familiarize himself with the exact details of his own experience; the auditor may not tell him anything about his case or evaluate any of the information the pre-Clear finds.\n\n==Therapeutic claims==\n\nIn August 1950, amidst the success of ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics]]'', Hubbard held a demonstration in Los Angeles' [[Shrine Auditorium]] where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianca (a pseudonym) to a large audience including many reporters and photographers as 'the world's first [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]].\"  Despite Hubbard's claim that she had \"full and perfect recall of every moment of her life\", Bianca proved unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities, including the question of the color of Hubbard's tie.  Hubbard explained Bianca's failure to display her promised powers of recall to the audience by saying that he had used the word \"now\" in calling her to the stage, and thus inadvertently froze her in \"present time,\" which blocked her abilities.<ref>{{cite book|first=Russell|last=Miller|title=Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L.

Professor [[John Alan Lee|John A. Lee]] states in his 1970 evaluation of Dianetics:\n\n{{quote|Objective experimental verification of Hubbard's [[physiology|physiological]] and psychological doctrines is lacking. To date, no regular scientific agency has established the validity of his theories of prenatal perception and engrams, or cellular memory, or Dianetic reverie, or the effects of Scientology auditing routines. Existing knowledge contradicts Hubbard's theory of recording of perceptions during periods of unconsciousness.<ref>Lee, John A. ''Sectarian Healers and Hypnotherapy'', 1970, Ontario</ref>}}\n\nThe [[MEDLINE]] database records two independent scientific studies on Dianetics, both conducted in the 1950s under the auspices of [[New York University]]. Harvey Jay Fischer tested Dianetics therapy against three claims made by proponents and found it does not effect any significant changes in intellectual functioning, mathematical ability, or the degree of personality conflicts;<ref>Fischer, Harvey Jay. \"Dianetic therapy: an experimental evaluation. A statistical analysis of the effect of dianetic therapy as measured by group tests of intelligence, mathematics and personality.\" Abstract of Ph.D. thesis, 1953, New York University ([http://home.snafu.de/tilman/krasel/dianetics_test2.html Excerpt])</ref> Jack Fox tested Hubbard's thesis regarding recall of engrams, with the assistance of the Dianetic Research Foundation, and could not substantiate it.<ref>Fox, J.; Davis, A.E.; Lebovits, B. \"An experimental investigation of Hubbard's engram hypothesis (dianetics)\". ''Psychological Newsletter'', New York University. 10 1959, 131-134</ref>\n\nCommentators from a variety of backgrounds have described Dianetics as an example of pseudoscience. For example, [[philosophy]] professor [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]] points to Dianetics' lack of empirical evidence:\n\n{{quote|What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims. The key elements of Hubbard's so-called science don't seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments. It isn't even clear what such \"data\" would look like. Most of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations ... Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science.<ref>[[Robert Todd Carroll|Carroll, Robert T.]] [http://skepdic.com/dianetic.html \"Dianetics\"], ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''</ref>}}\n\nThe validity and practice of auditing have been questioned by a variety of non-Scientologist commentators. Commenting on the example cited by Winter, the science writer [[Martin Gardner]] asserts that \"nothing could be clearer from the above dialogue than the fact that the dianetic explanation for the headache existed only in the mind of the therapist, and that it was with considerable difficulty that the patient was maneuvered into accepting it.\"<ref>Gardner, Martin. '' Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''. Dover, 1957</ref>\n\nOther critics and medical experts have suggested that Dianetic auditing is a form of [[hypnosis]].<ref>\"Never believe a hypnotist - An investigation of L.
