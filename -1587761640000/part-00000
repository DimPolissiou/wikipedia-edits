Epsilon Iota officially became the 37th chapter of the Psi Upsilon international fraternity on April 16, 1982, and remains co-ed with an approximately equal number of male and female brothers. The chapter currently resides at 2140 Burdett Avenue in Troy.

Dumont (A349) all of which have been inducted into the RPI Hall of Fame. Numerous campus buildings and rooms are named after Alpha chapter alumni: the Darrin Communications Center, named after David M. Darrin (A566); Ricketts Building, named after Palmer C. Ricketts (A84); Waite Dormitory, named after Christopher Champlain Waite (A3) who is one of the fraternities founding members; Hall Hall named after James Hall (A83); DuMont room in the Student Union named after Allen B. DuMont (A349); and many more. The origin of the nickname \"The Zoo\" or just \"Zoo\" is rumored to be from the early 1960s when Theta Xi brothers engaged in an altercation with another fraternity during an RPI hockey game. It is believed that RPI's newspaper, ''The Poly'', stated in an article about the altercation that the brothers of Theta Xi acted like \"a zoo\".\n: In December 2013, the chapter house was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
