Kanout\u00e9 was named the 2007 [[African Footballer of the Year]], the first player born outside Africa to win the award.\n\nKanout\u00e9 began his career with [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in France before moving to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] of the [[Premier League]] in 2000. After a spell at their [[London]] rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], Kanout\u00e9 moved to Spanish club Sevilla where he won two consecutive [[UEFA Cup]]s in 2006 and 2007 in addition to various other European and domestic honours and remains the club's highest-scoring foreign player.

He formed a solid partnership with [[Paolo Di Canio]] and after some promising appearances in the Premier League, Hammers manager [[Harry Redknapp]] made his move permanent. Kanout\u00e9 had varying success at the [[Boleyn Ground]], often praised for his ability, but also criticised for his laid back attitude.

He refused to wear a Sevilla shirt bearing the name of club sponsor [[888.com]], due to the fact the website is used for gambling, which is against the principles of Islam; this meant that the club had to give him a brand-free jersey every match. The company, however, agreed to excuse him from their publicity campaigns in return for Kanout\u00e9 wearing the sponsored kit, which was part of the players' contractual duties. In 2007, Kanout\u00e9 paid more than US$700,000 out of his pocket to buy a mosque in Seville. The contract on the premises had expired and the mosque was due to be sold. The Islamic community of Spain confirmed it had requested Kanout\u00e9's aid after the mosque was put up for sale.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/7141005.stm |title=Devout worshipper |accessdate=12 December 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport | date=12 December 2007 |first=Phil |last=Minshull}}</ref>\n\nKanout\u00e9 insists his faith has never presented itself as a problem in his relationship with the coaching staff, teammates or fans.

retired Malian-French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for several top-tier clubs in Europe, enjoying his greatest success with [[La Liga]] side [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]]. Kanout\u00e9 was named the 2007 [[African Footballer of the Year]], the first player born outside Africa to win the award.\n\nKanout\u00e9 began his career with [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in France before moving to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] of the [[Premier League]] in 2000. After a spell at their [[London]] rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], Kanout\u00e9 moved to Spanish club Sevilla where he won two consecutive [[UEFA Cup]]s in 2006 and 2007 in addition to various other European and domestic honours and remains the club's highest-scoring foreign player. He joined [[Beijing Guoan F.C.|Beijing Goan]] in June 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/confederations/news/newsid=682981.html#kanoute+named+africas+best|title=Kanoute named Africa's best|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2887/asia/2012/06/30/3211032/kanoute-leaves-sevilla-for-beijing-guoan Kanoute leaves Sevilla for Beijing Guoan] Goal.com, 30 June 2012</ref><ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1658034.html Kanoute heads to China] FIFA.com, 30 June 2012</ref>\n\nDespite appearing 16 times for [[France under-21 national football team|France U-21]], Kanout\u00e9 was a member of the [[Mali national football team|Malian squad]] which reached the semi-finals of the [[2004 African Cup of Nations]] and also featured in their selections for the tournament in 2006 and 2010. His international career ended in 2010 with a total of 39\ncaps and 23 goals.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Lyon===\nKanout\u00e9's talents as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] were first noticed by his local team, [[Olympique Lyonnais]], and he joined them as an apprentice in 1997. He made his debut in the Intertoto Cup against Polish side [[Odra Wodzis\u0142aw]].\n\n===West Ham United===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2013}}\nIn 2000, Kanout\u00e9 was signed by English Premier League side [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on an initial loan basis. He formed a solid partnership with [[Paolo Di Canio]] and after some promising appearances in the Premier League, Hammers manager [[Harry Redknapp]] made his move permanent. Kanout\u00e9 had varying success at the [[Boleyn Ground]], often praised for his ability, but also criticised for his laid back attitude. West Ham were relegated at the end of the 2002-2003 season.\n\n===Tottenham Hotspur===\nKanout\u00e9 was bought by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a fee of \u00a33.5 million on 5 August 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2408950/All-clear-for-Kanoute-as-Tottenham-wrap-up-deal.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=William | last=Johnson | title=All clear for Kanoute as Tottenham wrap up deal | date=5 August 2003}}</ref> He scored his first goal on 23 August, the winner in a 2-1 home league victory over Leeds, nine minutes after coming on for [[Bobby Zamora]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3152277.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kanoute grabs Spurs winner | date=23 August 2003}}</ref>\n\nHis first season was interrupted by a call-up for the [[2004 Africa Cup of Nations]] for [[Mali national football team|Mali]].

Although eligible for either, Kanout\u00e9 elected to play for [[Mali national football team|Mali]] rather than for France. Kanout\u00e9 was joint top goal scorer for Mali at the [[2004 African Cup of Nations]]. Kanout\u00e9 scored four goals in four matches helping Mali to the semi-finals, where they lost to [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]].\n\nIn October 2007, Kanout\u00e9, along with Mali international teammate [[Mamady Sidibe]], were attacked by irate [[Togo]]lese fans after they knocked [[Togo national football team|Togo]] out of the [[African Cup of Nations]] qualifier.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/7045327.stm \"Caf to discuss Togo attacks\"] BBC Sport, 15 October 2007; Retrieved 15 October 2007</ref> Frederic Kanoute announced his retirement from international football following Mali's elimination from the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/8472669.stm \"Kanoute retires after Mali exit\"] BBC Sport, 21 February 2010</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nKanout\u00e9 was born in [[Sainte-Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon]], [[Rh\u00f4ne]], to a [[French people|French]] mother and a [[Mali]]an father.\n\nHe has been practicing [[Islam]] since he was around the age of 22. He refused to wear a Sevilla shirt bearing the name of club sponsor [[888.com]], due to the fact the website is used for gambling, which is against the principles of Islam; this meant that the club had to give him a brand-free jersey every match. The company, however, agreed to excuse him from their publicity campaigns in return for Kanout\u00e9 wearing the sponsored kit, which was part of the players' contractual duties. In 2007, Kanout\u00e9 paid more than US$700,000 out of his pocket to buy a mosque in Seville. The contract on the premises had expired and the mosque was due to be sold. The Islamic community of Spain confirmed it had requested Kanout\u00e9's aid after the mosque was put up for sale.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/7141005.stm |title=Devout worshipper |accessdate=12 December 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport  | date=12 December 2007 |first=Phil |last=Minshull}}</ref>\n\nKanout\u00e9 insists his faith has never presented itself as a problem in his relationship with the coaching staff, teammates or fans.

I gave her a lift up to the bus stop and I was saying, 'Will we see you next week?' We gave her a tape of the music for 'Linger', which she took with her.

In a 2012 interview, O'Riordan commented, \"I remember when [[MTV]] first put 'Linger' in heavy rotation, every time I walked into a diner or a hotel lobby, it was like, 'Jesus, man, here I am again'.
