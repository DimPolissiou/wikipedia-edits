There have been so many incidents like this of eyeball meet-ups. What\u2019s more dangerous is you not only go to that eyeball meet-up, you even went out for a drink. That\u2019s the problem, that\u2019s the hardest of all, especially since you\u2019re drinking out with an all-male group.\" Later, seemingly cutting off Jeff Canoy, Taberna was heard saying, \"No. The truth is it\u2019s easy to say that to men.

It took place in South Australia and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Teams from the seven [[test cricket#Test cricket playing nations|Test-playing nation]]s, as well as an [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|ICC Associates]] XI, competed in a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format. [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] lost only one match, their final round-robin game against Pakistan by which time they had qualified for the semis. They went on to beat [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] by five wickets in the final, thanks to an unbeaten hundred from Brett Williams. England and West Indies made up the last four, but India were the real disappointments. After opening with a good win against England, they suffered hefty defeats in four matches to be knocked out early.\nThe tournament was notable for the number of future international players who competed. Future England captains [[Nasser Hussain]] and [[Mike Atherton]] played, as did Indian spinner [[Venkatapathy Raju]], New Zealand all-rounder [[Chris Cairns]], Pakistanis [[Mushtaq Ahmed (cricketer)|Mushtaq Ahmed]]  and [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], Sri Lankan [[Sanath Jayasuriya]], and West Indians [[Brian Lara]], [[Ridley Jacobs]], and [[Jimmy Adams]].\nAustralia's Brett Williams was the leading run-scorer, with 471 [[run (cricket)|run]]s at an [[batting average (cricket)|average]] of 52.33. [[Wayne Holdsworth]] from Australia and [[Mushtaq Ahmed (cricketer)|Mushtaq Ahmed]] were the leading wicket-takers, with 19 [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wicket]]s at [[Bowling average|average]]s of 12.52 and 16.21 respectively.\n\n===1998 (Winner: England)===\n{{main|1998 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\n\n[[England national cricket team|England]] were the unexpected winners of the second Under-19 World Cup in [[South Africa]]. In 1998, the event was relaunched in South Africa as a biennial tournament. The only previous tournament of its kind was held ten years earlier. In addition to the nine Test-playing nations, there were teams from [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]], [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]], [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]], [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]], [[Denmark national cricket team|Denmark]], [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] and [[Papua New Guinea national cricket team|Papua New Guinea]]. The teams were divided into four pools, named after Gavaskar, Sobers, Cowdrey and Bradman, and the top two sides from each progressed to two Super League pools, whose winners advanced to the final. In order to give everyone a decent amount of cricket, the non-qualifiers competed in a Plate League, won by Bangladesh, who beat [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in the final. West Indies failed to qualify for the Super League after a fiasco concerning the composition of their squad - they arrived with seven players who contravened the age restrictions for the tournament. The Super League, in which every game was covered live on South African satellite television, also threw up a number of shocks and tense finishes; both pools came down to net run-rate at the finish. England, from being down and almost out, beat Pakistan - who surprisingly lost all three of their games - but lost a rain-affected match to India. Australia had beaten India and Pakistan and were favourites to reach the final. Only a massive defeat by England could deny them: but that is precisely what they suffered. In front of a crowd of about 6,000 at Newlands, they were bowled out for 147. [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] joined England in the final, where a century from England's Stephen Peters won the day.\n[[Chris Gayle]] was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 364 runs at an average of 72.80. West Indian [[Ramnaresh Sarwan]] and Zimbabwean [[Mluleki Nkala]] were the leading wicket-takers, with 16 wickets at 10.81 and 13.06 respectively.\n\n===2000 (Winner: India)===\n{{main|2000 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThe 2000 tournament was held in [[Sri Lanka]], and replicated the format from 1998. Participating nations included the nine Test-playing nations, as well as Bangladesh, Kenya, Ireland, Namibia, Holland, Nepal and [[Americas under-19 cricket team|a combined team]] from the [[ICC Americas|Americas development region]]. To the disappointment of a large crowd at Colombo's SSC, Sri Lanka fell at the final hurdle in a final dominated by [[India]]. The winners remained unbeaten throughout, and destroyed Australia by 170 runs in the semi-final to underline their supremacy. In the other semi-final, Sri Lanka delighted a crowd of 5000 at Galle by beating Pakistan. The fact that three of the four semi-finalists were from Asia and so more attuned to the conditions was coincidental - they played the better cricket and, in Pakistan's case, had a very experienced squad. England, the defending champions, were most disappointing, and they won only one match against a Test-playing country, and that a last-ball victory over Zimbabwe. South Africa, one of the favourites, were desperately unlucky to be eliminated after three no-results gave them three points while Nepal, with four points courtesy of one win over Kenya, went through to the Super League instead. The format of the tournament was as in 1997\u201398, with four groups of four and then a Super League and final. [[Graeme Smith]] was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 348 runs at an average of 87.00. Pakistan's [[Zahid Saeed]] was the leading wicket-taker, with 15 wickets at 7.60. India's [[Yuvraj Singh]] was named Man of the Series. India clinched the title for the first time under the captaincy of [[Mohammed Kaif]].\n\n===2002 (Winner: Australia)===\n{{main|2002 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThe fourth Under-19 World Cup held in [[New Zealand]] only confirmed [[Australia|Australia's]] dominance of the game, and from their opening match, when they obliterated Kenya by 430 runs, through to their comprehensive victory over South Africa in the final, they were never threatened. Participating nations included the ten Test-playing nations, plus Canada, Kenya, Namibia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Scotland. Their captain, Cameron White, was singled out for praise for his leadership, and he chipped in with 423 runs at 70.50. And they didn't rely on pace either, playing only two seamers and four slow bowlers, with Xavier Doherty, a slow left-armer, leading the wicket-takers with 16 at 9.50 and all without a single wide. In contrast, India, the holders, underperformed in their semi-final against South Africa, a team they had easily beaten a week or so earlier. They also suffered embarrassing defeats to neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh. Pakistan, however, provided the main upset when they lost to Nepal by 30 runs, and Nepal also gave England a few uneasy moments. Zimbabwe won the plate competition, with their expected opponents, Bangladesh, beaten in the semi-final by Nepal. Australian [[Cameron White]] was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 423 runs at an average of 70.50 and [[Xavier Doherty]] was the leading wicket-taker, with 16 wickets at 9.50. [[Tatenda Taibu]], Zimbabwe's captain, was Man of the Series for his 250 runs and 12 wickets, not to mention his wicket-keeping in between bowling stints.\n\n===2004 (Winner: Pakistan)===\n{{main|2004 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThe 2004 tournament was held in [[Bangladesh]]. More than 350,000 spectators saw the 54 matches played in the tournament. The finale ended with a close final between the two best teams - West Indies and [[Pakistan]]. It was won by Pakistan by 25 runs against West Indies and a 30,000 crowd acclaimed the victorious Pakistanis almost as their own. The players, from the ten Test countries and six other nations, were feted wherever they went, and the appetite for cricket was remarkable: even Zimbabwe v Canada sold out. The shock was the elimination from the main competition of holders Australia, bowled out for 73 and beaten by Zimbabwe in the group stage when Tinashe Panyangara took 6 for 31, the second-best figures in the competition's history. And Australia then lost to Bangladesh in the plate final amid thumping drums and gleeful celebrations. The downside was the quality of the cricket, which was often mediocre on some indifferent pitches, and the reporting of six unidentified bowlers for having suspect actions. Pakistan would have finished unbeaten but for a hiccup against England - when both teams had already qualified for the semis. England reached the last four, which was progress, and [[Alastair Cook]] looked a class apart. But they came unstuck against West Indies' spinners in the semi-final. India completed the semi-finalists. [[Shikhar Dhawan]] and [[Suresh Raina]] were the backbone of a strong batting line-up, and Raina's 90 from just 38 balls against the hapless Scots was as brutal an innings as one will see at any level. Both looked international-class already, though faced with a tough task breaking into their senior side's formidable top order. The captain [[Ambati Rayudu]] had been hailed as the next great batting hope, having scored a century and a double in a first-class match at the age of 17. But he did not score the runs promised and was banned by the referee John Morrison from the semi-final after allowing a funereal over-rate during the Super League win against Sri Lanka: eight overs were bowled in the first 50 minutes. India's [[Shikhar Dhawan]] was named Man of the Tournament, and was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 505 runs at an average of 84.16. Bangladeshi [[Enamul Haque Jr|Enamul Haque]] was the leading wicket-taker, with 22 wickets at 10.18.\n\n===2006 (Winner: Pakistan)===\n{{main|2006 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThis tournament was always going to struggle to live up to the overwhelming response that greeted the previous event in Bangladesh. Despite free tickets the matches were sparsely attended even when the home side were in action, but it shouldn't detract from an impressive two weeks which finished with Pakistan securing their second consecutive title in an extraordinary final against India at the Premadasa Stadium. Pakistan crumbled to 109, but in a thrilling passage of play reduced India to 9 for 6. [[Nasir Jamshed]], and [[Anwar Ali (cricketer, born 1987)|Anwar Ali]], two of the success stories of the tournament, did the damage and there was no way back for India who fell 38 runs short. These two teams and Australia were the pick of the sides and along with England - who surpassed expectation to reach the semi-finals after beating a talented Bangladesh side - made up the final four. A number of players caught the eye, notably Australia captain [[Moises Henriques]], the Indian batsmen [[Cheteshwar Pujara]] - the tournament's leading run-scorer - and teammate [[Rohit Sharma]], along with legspinner [[Piyush Chawla]], who a few weeks later made his Test debut against England. However, perhaps the best story of the tournament was Nepal claiming the Plate trophy after a thrilling victory against New Zealand having also beaten South Africa during the event\n\n===2008 (Winner: India)===\n{{main|2008 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nIt was the first time the tournament was held in an Associate Member country. The 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in [[Malaysia]] from 17 February to 2 March 2008. Along with hosts, 15 other teams battled in 44 matches packed into 15 days across three cities. India, still smarting from the loss in the previous edition had reason to be upbeat with Tanmay Srivastava, a mature batsman who eventually finished as the tournament's leading run-getter, in their ranks. Australia and England had forgettable campaigns, coming up short against the big teams after making mincemeat of the minnows. Defending champions Pakistan were fortuitous to reach the semi-finals as their batsmen never really got going and, against South Africa in the semi-finals, their luck finally ran out while chasing 261. New Zealand, boosted by Man of the Tournament [[Tim Southee]], were impressive before losing to India in a narrow run-chase under lights and cloudy skies in the other semi-final. South Africa's captain [[Wayne Parnell]] had played a major role in ensuring their passage to the summit clash, picking up the most wickets in the tournament en route. But they had lost to India in the group stages and lightning did strike twice. India under the  leadership of [[Virat Kohli]], after being bowled out for 159, emerged triumphant by 12 runs under the D/L method and were crowned champions for the second time. \n<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://cricket.indiatimes.com/India_clinch_U-19_World_Cup/articleshow/2830660.cms\n|title=Indiatimes Cricket\n|publisher=Indiatimes Cricket\n|accessdate=2008-03-02\n}}</ref>\n\n===2010 (Winner: Australia)===\n{{main|2010 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThe 2010 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in [[New Zealand]] in January 2010.  The tournament was hosted in New Zealand after the ICC took it away from Kenya on the flimsiest of reasons which ridiculed its own mission to spread the game. Kenya were further kicked by the ICC as their side was not allowed to participate as it had not won the African qualifying event - a weakened side had been fielded as at the time, as hosts, they did not need to qualify. As it was, New Zealand did a decent job but crowds were dismal and the group stages were as tediously predictable as in the senior tournament, with the better-funded big nations dominating. South Africa did beat Australia in a good match but a dead rubber. The competition came alive in the quarter-finals as West Indies beat England and Sri Lanka defeated South Africa. The best tie of the competition came when Pakistan beat fierce rivals India by two wickets with three balls remaining in a low-scoring match. The final between Australia and [[Pakistan]] was a rematch of the first tournament, and Australia won by 25 runs in a game where fortunes ebbed and flowed throughout.\n\n===2012 (Winner: India)===\n{{main|2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThe 2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in the Tony Ireland Stadium, Australia. Along with the ten test playing nations, Afghanistan, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Ireland, Scotland and Namibia also participated in this tournament. Australia lost against India in the final on 26 August 2012. India's third U19 World Cup meant they tied for the most wins with Australia. Sri Lanka could not go through into the last eight but won the Plate championship by defeating Afghanistan by 7 wickets. Reece Topley of England was the highest wicket taker whereas Anamul Haque of Bangladesh was the top run getter. India won the final against Australia with 14 balls to spare and 6 wickets remaining. Captain [[Unmukt Chand]] played a match winning knock of 111* not out in 130 balls with the help of 6 sixes & 7 fours. [[Sandeep Sharma]] also excelled with four wickets under his belt.\n\n===2014 (Winner: South Africa)===\n{{main|2014 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}} \nThe 2014 Under-19 Cricket World-Cup was held in Dubai (U.A.E.) in 2014. It was the first time that U.A.E. had hosted an ICC event. Afghanistan was the only non-full member to qualify for the Quarter Finals. This was the first time that Afghanistan reached the last eight of this tournament, courtesy of their stellar performance against Australia in the group stage. In fact, this was the second time that a non-test playing nation qualified for the Super League/Quarter Finals, Nepal being the first one in the 2000 edition.\nIndia wobbled in the Quarter Finals against England and finally lost in the final over. This was the first semi-final berth for England in the last four editions. Pakistan beat England in the semis to reach its fifth Under-19 Final, becoming the first team to do so. South Africa beat Australia in the second semi-final. In a one-sided final, South Africa beat Pakistan and claimed its maiden U-19 World Cup title. [[Corbin Bosch]], son of former South African cricketer late [[Tertius Bosch]], was the Man of the Match in the finals and [[Aiden Markram]] was the Man of the Series. South Africa did not lose even a single match in the entire tournament.\n\n===2016 (Winner: West Indies)===\n{{main|2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThe 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in [[Bangladesh]]. It was the eleventh edition of the Under-19 World Cup, and the second to be held in Bangladesh.

It was the 12th Edition of the Under-19 World Cup.

Under-19 Cricket World Cup''' is an international [[cricket]] tournament organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) contested by national under-19 teams. First contested [[1988 Youth Cricket World Cup|in 1988]], as the '''Youth World Cup''', it was not staged again [[1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup|until 1998]]. Since then, the World Cup has been held as a biennial event, organised by the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]]. The first edition of the tournament had only eight participants, but every subsequent edition has included sixteen teams.

It took place in South Australia and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Teams from the seven [[test cricket#Test cricket playing nations|Test-playing nation]]s, as well as an [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|ICC Associates]] XI, competed in a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format. [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] lost only one match, their final round-robin game against Pakistan by which time they had qualified for the semis. They went on to beat [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] by five wickets in the final, thanks to an unbeaten hundred from Brett Williams. England and West Indies made up the last four, but India were the real disappointments. After opening with a good win against England, they suffered hefty defeats in four matches to be knocked out early.\nThe tournament was notable for the number of future international players who competed. Future England captains [[Nasser Hussain]] and [[Mike Atherton]] played, as did Indian spinner [[Venkatapathy Raju]], New Zealand all-rounder [[Chris Cairns]], Pakistanis [[Mushtaq Ahmed (cricketer)|Mushtaq Ahmed]]  and [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], Sri Lankan [[Sanath Jayasuriya]], and West Indians [[Brian Lara]], [[Ridley Jacobs]], and [[Jimmy Adams]].\nAustralia's Brett Williams was the leading run-scorer, with 471 [[run (cricket)|run]]s at an [[batting average (cricket)|average]] of 52.33. [[Wayne Holdsworth]] from Australia and [[Mushtaq Ahmed (cricketer)|Mushtaq Ahmed]] were the leading wicket-takers, with 19 [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wicket]]s at [[Bowling average|average]]s of 12.52 and 16.21 respectively.\n\n===1998 (Winner: England)===\n{{main|1998 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\n\n[[England national cricket team|England]] were the unexpected winners of the second Under-19 World Cup in [[South Africa]]. In 1998, the event was relaunched in South Africa as a biennial tournament. The only previous tournament of its kind was held ten years earlier. In addition to the nine Test-playing nations, there were teams from [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]], [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]], [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]], [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]], [[Denmark national cricket team|Denmark]], [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] and [[Papua New Guinea national cricket team|Papua New Guinea]]. The teams were divided into four pools, named after Gavaskar, Sobers, Cowdrey and Bradman, and the top two sides from each progressed to two Super League pools, whose winners advanced to the final. In order to give everyone a decent amount of cricket, the non-qualifiers competed in a Plate League, won by Bangladesh, who beat [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in the final. West Indies failed to qualify for the Super League after a fiasco concerning the composition of their squad - they arrived with seven players who contravened the age restrictions for the tournament. The Super League, in which every game was covered live on South African satellite television, also threw up a number of shocks and tense finishes; both pools came down to net run-rate at the finish. England, from being down and almost out, beat Pakistan - who surprisingly lost all three of their games - but lost a rain-affected match to India. Australia had beaten India and Pakistan and were favourites to reach the final. Only a massive defeat by England could deny them: but that is precisely what they suffered. In front of a crowd of about 6,000 at Newlands, they were bowled out for 147. [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] joined England in the final, where a century from England's Stephen Peters won the day.\n[[Chris Gayle]] was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 364 runs at an average of 72.80. West Indian [[Ramnaresh Sarwan]] and Zimbabwean [[Mluleki Nkala]] were the leading wicket-takers, with 16 wickets at 10.81 and 13.06 respectively.\n\n===2000 (Winner: India)===\n{{main|2000 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThe 2000 tournament was held in [[Sri Lanka]], and replicated the format from 1998. Participating nations included the nine Test-playing nations, as well as Bangladesh, Kenya, Ireland, Namibia, Holland, Nepal and [[Americas under-19 cricket team|a combined team]] from the [[ICC Americas|Americas development region]]. To the disappointment of a large crowd at Colombo's SSC, Sri Lanka fell at the final hurdle in a final dominated by [[India]]. The winners remained unbeaten throughout, and destroyed Australia by 170 runs in the semi-final to underline their supremacy. In the other semi-final, Sri Lanka delighted a crowd of 5000 at Galle by beating Pakistan. The fact that three of the four semi-finalists were from Asia and so more attuned to the conditions was coincidental - they played the better cricket and, in Pakistan's case, had a very experienced squad. England, the defending champions, were most disappointing, and they won only one match against a Test-playing country, and that a last-ball victory over Zimbabwe. South Africa, one of the favourites, were desperately unlucky to be eliminated after three no-results gave them three points while Nepal, with four points courtesy of one win over Kenya, went through to the Super League instead. The format of the tournament was as in 1997\u201398, with four groups of four and then a Super League and final. [[Graeme Smith]] was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 348 runs at an average of 87.00. Pakistan's [[Zahid Saeed]] was the leading wicket-taker, with 15 wickets at 7.60. India's [[Yuvraj Singh]] was named Man of the Series. India clinched the title for the first time under the captaincy of [[Mohammed Kaif]].\n\n===2002 (Winner: Australia)===\n{{main|2002 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThe fourth Under-19 World Cup held in [[New Zealand]] only confirmed [[Australia|Australia's]] dominance of the game, and from their opening match, when they obliterated Kenya by 430 runs, through to their comprehensive victory over South Africa in the final, they were never threatened. Participating nations included the ten Test-playing nations, plus Canada, Kenya, Namibia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Scotland. Their captain, Cameron White, was singled out for praise for his leadership, and he chipped in with 423 runs at 70.50. And they didn't rely on pace either, playing only two seamers and four slow bowlers, with Xavier Doherty, a slow left-armer, leading the wicket-takers with 16 at 9.50 and all without a single wide. In contrast, India, the holders, underperformed in their semi-final against South Africa, a team they had easily beaten a week or so earlier. They also suffered embarrassing defeats to neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh. Pakistan, however, provided the main upset when they lost to Nepal by 30 runs, and Nepal also gave England a few uneasy moments. Zimbabwe won the plate competition, with their expected opponents, Bangladesh, beaten in the semi-final by Nepal. Australian [[Cameron White]] was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 423 runs at an average of 70.50 and [[Xavier Doherty]] was the leading wicket-taker, with 16 wickets at 9.50. [[Tatenda Taibu]], Zimbabwe's captain, was Man of the Series for his 250 runs and 12 wickets, not to mention his wicket-keeping in between bowling stints.\n\n===2004 (Winner: Pakistan)===\n{{main|2004 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThe 2004 tournament was held in [[Bangladesh]]. More than 350,000 spectators saw the 54 matches played in the tournament. The finale ended with a close final between the two best teams - West Indies and [[Pakistan]]. It was won by Pakistan by 25 runs against West Indies and a 30,000 crowd acclaimed the victorious Pakistanis almost as their own. The players, from the ten Test countries and six other nations, were feted wherever they went, and the appetite for cricket was remarkable: even Zimbabwe v Canada sold out. The shock was the elimination from the main competition of holders Australia, bowled out for 73 and beaten by Zimbabwe in the group stage when Tinashe Panyangara took 6 for 31, the second-best figures in the competition's history. And Australia then lost to Bangladesh in the plate final amid thumping drums and gleeful celebrations. The downside was the quality of the cricket, which was often mediocre on some indifferent pitches, and the reporting of six unidentified bowlers for having suspect actions. Pakistan would have finished unbeaten but for a hiccup against England - when both teams had already qualified for the semis. England reached the last four, which was progress, and [[Alastair Cook]] looked a class apart. But they came unstuck against West Indies' spinners in the semi-final. India completed the semi-finalists. [[Shikhar Dhawan]] and [[Suresh Raina]] were the backbone of a strong batting line-up, and Raina's 90 from just 38 balls against the hapless Scots was as brutal an innings as one will see at any level. Both looked international-class already, though faced with a tough task breaking into their senior side's formidable top order. The captain [[Ambati Rayudu]] had been hailed as the next great batting hope, having scored a century and a double in a first-class match at the age of 17. But he did not score the runs promised and was banned by the referee John Morrison from the semi-final after allowing a funereal over-rate during the Super League win against Sri Lanka: eight overs were bowled in the first 50 minutes. India's [[Shikhar Dhawan]] was named Man of the Tournament, and was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 505 runs at an average of 84.16. Bangladeshi [[Enamul Haque Jr|Enamul Haque]] was the leading wicket-taker, with 22 wickets at 10.18.\n\n===2006 (Winner: Pakistan)===\n{{main|2006 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThis tournament was always going to struggle to live up to the overwhelming response that greeted the previous event in Bangladesh. Despite free tickets the matches were sparsely attended even when the home side were in action, but it shouldn't detract from an impressive two weeks which finished with Pakistan securing their second consecutive title in an extraordinary final against India at the Premadasa Stadium. Pakistan crumbled to 109, but in a thrilling passage of play reduced India to 9 for 6. [[Nasir Jamshed]], and [[Anwar Ali (cricketer, born 1987)|Anwar Ali]], two of the success stories of the tournament, did the damage and there was no way back for India who fell 38 runs short. These two teams and Australia were the pick of the sides and along with England - who surpassed expectation to reach the semi-finals after beating a talented Bangladesh side - made up the final four. A number of players caught the eye, notably Australia captain [[Moises Henriques]], the Indian batsmen [[Cheteshwar Pujara]] - the tournament's leading run-scorer - and teammate [[Rohit Sharma]], along with legspinner [[Piyush Chawla]], who a few weeks later made his Test debut against England. However, perhaps the best story of the tournament was Nepal claiming the Plate trophy after a thrilling victory against New Zealand having also beaten South Africa during the event\n\n===2008 (Winner: India)===\n{{main|2008 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nIt was the first time the tournament was held in an Associate Member country. The 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in [[Malaysia]] from 17 February to 2 March 2008. Along with hosts, 15 other teams battled in 44 matches packed into 15 days across three cities. India, still smarting from the loss in the previous edition had reason to be upbeat with Tanmay Srivastava, a mature batsman who eventually finished as the tournament's leading run-getter, in their ranks. Australia and England had forgettable campaigns, coming up short against the big teams after making mincemeat of the minnows. Defending champions Pakistan were fortuitous to reach the semi-finals as their batsmen never really got going and, against South Africa in the semi-finals, their luck finally ran out while chasing 261. New Zealand, boosted by Man of the Tournament [[Tim Southee]], were impressive before losing to India in a narrow run-chase under lights and cloudy skies in the other semi-final. South Africa's captain [[Wayne Parnell]] had played a major role in ensuring their passage to the summit clash, picking up the most wickets in the tournament en route. But they had lost to India in the group stages and lightning did strike twice.

The tournament was hosted in New Zealand after the ICC took it away from Kenya on the flimsiest of reasons which ridiculed its own mission to spread the game. Kenya were further kicked by the ICC as their side was not allowed to participate as it had not won the African qualifying event - a weakened side had been fielded as at the time, as hosts, they did not need to qualify. As it was, New Zealand did a decent job but crowds were dismal and the group stages were as tediously predictable as in the senior tournament, with the better-funded big nations dominating. South Africa did beat Australia in a good match but a dead rubber. The competition came alive in the quarter-finals as West Indies beat England and Sri Lanka defeated South Africa. The best tie of the competition came when Pakistan beat fierce rivals India by two wickets with three balls remaining in a low-scoring match. The final between Australia and [[Pakistan]] was a rematch of the first tournament, and Australia won by 25 runs in a game where fortunes ebbed and flowed throughout.\n\n===2012 (Winner: India)===\n{{main|2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}}\nThe 2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in the Tony Ireland Stadium, Australia.

Sri Lanka could not go through into the last eight but won the Plate championship by defeating Afghanistan by 7 wickets. Reece Topley of England was the highest wicket taker whereas Anamul Haque of Bangladesh was the top run getter. India won the final against Australia with 14 balls to spare and 6 wickets remaining. Captain [[Unmukt Chand]] played a match winning knock of 111* not out in 130 balls with the help of 6 sixes & 7 fours. [[Sandeep Sharma]] also excelled with four wickets under his belt.\n\n===2014 (Winner: South Africa)===\n{{main|2014 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup}} \nThe 2014 Under-19 Cricket World-Cup was held in Dubai (U.A.E.) in 2014. It was the first time that U.A.E. had hosted an ICC event. Afghanistan was the only non-full member to qualify for the Quarter Finals. This was the first time that Afghanistan reached the last eight of this tournament, courtesy of their stellar performance against Australia in the group stage. In fact, this was the second time that a non-test playing nation qualified for the Super League/Quarter Finals, Nepal being the first one in the 2000 edition.\nIndia wobbled in the Quarter Finals against England and finally lost in the final over. This was the first semi-final berth for England in the last four editions. Pakistan beat England in the semis to reach its fifth Under-19 Final, becoming the first team to do so.

It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter [[Robert Pollard]], who founded the group with his brother Jim Pollard, guitarist [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]], [[Tobin Sprout]], and drummer [[Kevin Fennell]]. The \"classic\" lineup included these musicians along with  bassist [[Greg Demos]], who also has some song co-writing credits.\n\nNoted at first for their [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] aesthetic and typically [[Portastudio]] four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices' music was influenced by early post\u2013[[British Invasion]] [[garage rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[post-punk]]. The band has had a prolific output, releasing 28 full-length albums along with [[Guided By Voices discography|many other releases]]. Most songs are in the two-minute range, but many are even shorter; often they end abruptly or are intertwined with odd and homemade [[sound effect]]s.\n\nGuided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004. In 2010 the \"classic\" lineup reunited to perform at [[Matador Records]] 21st anniversary party, subsequently touring and releasing six new albums. GBV broke up a second time in 2014, but Pollard again rebooted the band with a new album and a new lineup in 2016.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1983\u20131991)===\nFormed in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in the early 1980s, Guided by Voices began their career as a bar band working the local scene.  As lineups and day-jobs shifted, however, Pollard moved the band towards a studio-only orientation.  Guided by Voices' recording career began with a stream of self-financed, independent releases beginning with the R.E.M.-inspired E.P. ''[[Forever Since Breakfast]]'' and followed by the albums ''[[Devil Between My Toes]]'', ''[[Sandbox (Guided by Voices album)|Sandbox]]'', ''[[Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia]]'', and ''[[Same Place The Fly Got Smashed]]''.  With only a few hundred copies of each album being pressed, these tended to circulate only among the band members' family and friends.\n\n===Lo-fi (1992\u20131996)===\nWith the release of the ultra-limited album ''[[Propeller (Guided by Voices album)|Propeller]]'' in 1992 (of which only 500 copies were pressed, each with a unique, handmade cover), Guided by Voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown. This was due in part to gaining fans in the [[college rock]] circuit and bands such as [[Sonic Youth]], [[R.E.M.]] and [[The Breeders]].  New York City and Philadelphia were host to Guided by Voices' return to the live stage (and first shows outside of Ohio) in 1993.  At this time, the always-fluid Guided by Voices lineup coalesced around the core of Pollard, guitarists [[Tobin Sprout]] and [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]] (not to be confused with [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s drummer), bassist [[Greg Demos]], and drummer [[Kevin Fennell]].  Sprout, who was briefly featured in an early-'80s version of the band, had re-joined circa ''Propeller'' and soon became Pollard's primary musical foil, in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band's catalog. 1993 also saw the release of ''[[Vampire on Titus]]'', as well as the ''[[Fast Japanese Spin Cycle]]'' and ''[[Static Airplane Jive]]'' EPs.  Over the next year, the band began to receive national media exposure from sources such as ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine.\n\nIn 1994, after culling both new songs and reams of archival recordings from GBV's history, Pollard delivered the indie landmark ''[[Bee Thousand]]'' via [[Scat Records]], with a distribution deal through indie label [[Matador Records]].  Soon, the band officially signed with Matador, concurrent with Pollard and his bandmates finally retiring from their day jobs to work in music full-time.  The band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling, lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show, featuring Pollard's homegrown rock theatrics (consisting of karate-kicks, leaps, [[Roger Daltrey]]-inspired mic-twirling, later beer can throwing at rival bands<ref>{{Citation|last=Tim Krings|title=Bob Pollard throwing empty beer can at band|date=2010-07-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnb4GuuR2Lw&list=LLzjuRvUk5CF_p8rBConuR8g&index=15|accessdate=2017-11-07}}</ref>), [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]]'s [[Guitar showmanship|windmilling]] and [[chain smoking]], sometime bassist [[Greg Demos]]' striped pants, a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds, and prodigious alcohol consumption all around.\n\nTheir true Matador debut came in 1995 with ''[[Alien Lanes]]'', which, despite a five-figure recording allowance, was constructed out of home-recorded snippets on the cheap.  The band's underground following continued to grow, with notices coming from mainstream sources such as [[MTV]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.  Guided by Voices is frequently referenced by novelist and poet, Dennis Cooper, in his George Miles cycle and the group's lyrics appear in ''Guide'', the fourth of the five novels which make up the cycle. The first chapter of ''Guide'' is titled \"Guided by Voices\". After sessions for a concept album entitled ''[[The Power of Suck]]'' were aborted, the band assembled ''[[Under the Bushes Under the Stars]]'' out of their first 24-track studio sessions, recorded with [[Kim Deal]] and [[Steve Albini]] among others, in 1996. However, the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the \"classic lineup\", with Sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child, his painting, and his solo musical career.  Sprout and Pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996: Sprout's ''[[Carnival Boy]]'' and Pollard's ''[[Not in My Airforce]]'', with each making a guest appearance on the other's album. Pollard maintained an active, parallel solo and side project career alongside GBV releases for the remainder of that band's existence.  These records were primarily self-released. Because GBV alumni were regularly featured, and songs from these albums were frequently included in GBV setlists, they are informally considered to be part of the GBV canon. Also in 1995, the band contributed the song \"Sensational Gravity Boy\" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n===Major label (1997\u20132001)===\nPollard created a new incarnation of Guided by Voices with [[Cleveland]] [[glam rock]]ers [[Cobra Verde (band)|Cobra Verde]] in 1997. The following album ''[[Mag Earwhig!]]'', combined a new hard-rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track, \"[[Jane of the Waking Universe]]\", that featured the classic lineup for one last time.  However, after another year of rigorous touring, the \"Guided by Verde\" lineup split in late 1997 following Pollard's announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next Guided by Voices project.\n\nCobra Verde's [[Doug Gillard]] was tapped for yet another new Guided by Voices lineup in 1998, which also included \"classic\"-era bassist [[Greg Demos]], former [[The Breeders|Breeders]] drummer [[Jim Macpherson]], and eventually, former [[The Amps|Amps]]/Breeders guitarist [[The Amps|Nate Farley]]. Departing from Matador, this lineup (without Farley) worked with producer [[Ric Ocasek]] to create what was intended to be Guided by Voices' [[major label]] debut.  Initially produced for [[Capitol Records]], ''[[Do the Collapse]]'' was repeatedly delayed and finally released in mid-1999 on pseudo-indie label [[TVT Records|TVT]].  (In the UK it was released on [[Creation Records]]). Featuring a slick, heavily processed sound previously foreign to GBV albums, ''Do the Collapse'' failed to garner radio airplay, and was for the most part greeted with mixed reviews.\n\nThrough touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000, Guided by Voices' live act became legendary, with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark, and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs, Pollard solo tracks, impromptu covers of [[The Who]], [[David Bowie]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption.  In addition to multiple swings through the United States and Europe, 2000 saw the band's first and only visits to Australia and Japan. 2000 was capped with the release of the massive ''[[Suitcase: Failed Experiments and Trashed Aircraft|Suitcase]]'', a four-disc, 100-song trawl through three decades worth of Pollard's enormous reserve of unreleased material. (Three more box sets of unreleased songs, ''[[Suitcase 2: American Superdream Wow|Suitcase 2]]'', ''[[Suitcase 3: Up We Go Now|Suitcase 3]]'' and  ''[[Suitcase 4: Captain Kangaroo Won The War|Suitcase 4]]'' released in October 2005, November 2009 and November 2015 respectively.)\n\n2001's ''[[Isolation Drills]]'' was recorded with [[Rob Schnapf]],<ref name=BOMB-IsolationDrills-2001>{{cite journal|last1=McGonigal|first1=Mike|title=Robert Pollard|journal=[[Bomb (magazine)|BOMB]]|date=Summer 2001|issue=76|page=32\u201337|url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/robert-pollard/|publisher=New Art Publications}}</ref> who aimed to capture the band's live sound more closely than did Ocasek. Though the album debuted in ''Billboard'''s top 200 and received higher critical notices than its predecessor, it did not achieve the sought-after radio breakthrough.\n\n===Later years (2002\u20132004)===\n[[File:Robert pollard 0001.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Robert Pollard]] performing with Guided By Voices in 2014|255x255px]]\nAfter departing from TVT in 2002, Guided by Voices returned to Matador and released ''[[Universal Truths and Cycles]]'', a departure from the previous two radio-aspiring albums, and a return to the band's mid-90's, mid-fi aesthetic. ''Universal Truths'' producer [[Todd Tobias]] would also record the band's final two albums for Matador. 2003 saw the release of the prog-styled ''[[Earthquake Glue]]'', followed by the anthology box set ''[[Hardcore UFOs: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere]]'' and the [[greatest hits]] compilation ''[[Best of Guided by Voices: Human Amusements at Hourly Rates]]''.\n\nIn 2004, Pollard announced he was disbanding Guided by Voices<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |title=Special Announcement From Guided By Voices |publisher=Gbv.com |accessdate=2012-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315062433/http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |archivedate=2012-03-15 }}</ref> following the release of the ''[[Half-Smiles of the Decomposed]]'' LP, and a final farewell tour. Pollard stated:\n\n:\"This feels like the last album for Guided by Voices. I've always said that when I make a record that I'm totally satisfied with as befitting a final album, then that will be it. And this is it.\"\n\nGuided by Voices would go on to release no less than 15 more studio albums (since ''[[Surrender Your Poppy Field]]''')'''''.\n\nOn November 9, 2004, Guided by Voices performed on the stage of [[Austin City Limits]], broadcast by [[PBS]] on January 22, 2005. Their last television appearance was on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on December 2, 2004. They played the single, \"Everybody Thinks I'm a Raincloud (When I'm Not Looking)\".  After a select round of final US shows, Guided by Voices played their final show at The Metro in Chicago on December 31, 2004.  The four-hour, 63-song marathon finale is documented on the DVD ''The Electrifying Conclusion''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gbvdb.com/album.asp?albumid=2184 |title=The Electrifying Conclusion |publisher=Gbvdb.com |date=1994-01-15 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref>\n\n===Post-GBV (2005\u20132009)===\nPollard released his first post-GBV album in 2006 on [[Merge Records]].  The album, titled ''[[From a Compound Eye]]'' was a double LP produced by [[Todd Tobias]]. Later Pollard albums have been released on Merge and Pollard's own label, Guided by Voices Inc.\n\nFollowing GBV's demise, Pollard was frequently asked about band reunions. In 2007 he told [[Magnet (magazine)|''MAGNET'']]: \"To me, it\u2019s just cashing in. If you\u2019re gonna get the band back together, it should be to support a new record, not just to play the hits. That\u2019s like doing the county-fair circuit. I don\u2019t see Guided By Voices reforming.

It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter [[Robert Pollard]], who founded the group with his brother Jim Pollard, guitarist [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]], [[Tobin Sprout]], and drummer [[Kevin Fennell]]. The \"classic\" lineup included these musicians along with  bassist [[Greg Demos]], who also has some song co-writing credits.\n\nNoted at first for their [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] aesthetic and typically [[Portastudio]] four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices' music was influenced by early post\u2013[[British Invasion]] [[garage rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[post-punk]]. The band has had a prolific output, releasing 28 full-length albums along with [[Guided By Voices discography|many other releases]]. Most songs are in the two-minute range, but many are even shorter; often they end abruptly or are intertwined with odd and homemade [[sound effect]]s.\n\nGuided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004. In 2010 the \"classic\" lineup reunited to perform at [[Matador Records]] 21st anniversary party, subsequently touring and releasing six new albums. GBV broke up a second time in 2014, but Pollard again rebooted the band with a new album and a new lineup in 2016.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1983\u20131991)===\nFormed in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in the early 1980s, Guided by Voices began their career as a bar band working the local scene.  As lineups and day-jobs shifted, however, Pollard moved the band towards a studio-only orientation.  Guided by Voices' recording career began with a stream of self-financed, independent releases beginning with the R.E.M.-inspired E.P. ''[[Forever Since Breakfast]]'' and followed by the albums ''[[Devil Between My Toes]]'', ''[[Sandbox (Guided by Voices album)|Sandbox]]'', ''[[Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia]]'', and ''[[Same Place The Fly Got Smashed]]''.  With only a few hundred copies of each album being pressed, these tended to circulate only among the band members' family and friends.\n\n===Lo-fi (1992\u20131996)===\nWith the release of the ultra-limited album ''[[Propeller (Guided by Voices album)|Propeller]]'' in 1992 (of which only 500 copies were pressed, each with a unique, handmade cover), Guided by Voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown. This was due in part to gaining fans in the [[college rock]] circuit and bands such as [[Sonic Youth]], [[R.E.M.]] and [[The Breeders]].  New York City and Philadelphia were host to Guided by Voices' return to the live stage (and first shows outside of Ohio) in 1993.  At this time, the always-fluid Guided by Voices lineup coalesced around the core of Pollard, guitarists [[Tobin Sprout]] and [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]] (not to be confused with [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s drummer), bassist [[Greg Demos]], and drummer [[Kevin Fennell]].  Sprout, who was briefly featured in an early-'80s version of the band, had re-joined circa ''Propeller'' and soon became Pollard's primary musical foil, in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band's catalog. 1993 also saw the release of ''[[Vampire on Titus]]'', as well as the ''[[Fast Japanese Spin Cycle]]'' and ''[[Static Airplane Jive]]'' EPs.  Over the next year, the band began to receive national media exposure from sources such as ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine.\n\nIn 1994, after culling both new songs and reams of archival recordings from GBV's history, Pollard delivered the indie landmark ''[[Bee Thousand]]'' via [[Scat Records]], with a distribution deal through indie label [[Matador Records]].  Soon, the band officially signed with Matador, concurrent with Pollard and his bandmates finally retiring from their day jobs to work in music full-time.  The band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling, lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show, featuring Pollard's homegrown rock theatrics (consisting of karate-kicks, leaps, [[Roger Daltrey]]-inspired mic-twirling, later beer can throwing at rival bands<ref>{{Citation|last=Tim Krings|title=Bob Pollard throwing empty beer can at band|date=2010-07-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnb4GuuR2Lw&list=LLzjuRvUk5CF_p8rBConuR8g&index=15|accessdate=2017-11-07}}</ref>), [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]]'s [[Guitar showmanship|windmilling]] and [[chain smoking]], sometime bassist [[Greg Demos]]' striped pants, a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds, and prodigious alcohol consumption all around.\n\nTheir true Matador debut came in 1995 with ''[[Alien Lanes]]'', which, despite a five-figure recording allowance, was constructed out of home-recorded snippets on the cheap.  The band's underground following continued to grow, with notices coming from mainstream sources such as [[MTV]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.  Guided by Voices is frequently referenced by novelist and poet, Dennis Cooper, in his George Miles cycle and the group's lyrics appear in ''Guide'', the fourth of the five novels which make up the cycle. The first chapter of ''Guide'' is titled \"Guided by Voices\". After sessions for a concept album entitled ''[[The Power of Suck]]'' were aborted, the band assembled ''[[Under the Bushes Under the Stars]]'' out of their first 24-track studio sessions, recorded with [[Kim Deal]] and [[Steve Albini]] among others, in 1996. However, the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the \"classic lineup\", with Sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child, his painting, and his solo musical career.  Sprout and Pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996: Sprout's ''[[Carnival Boy]]'' and Pollard's ''[[Not in My Airforce]]'', with each making a guest appearance on the other's album. Pollard maintained an active, parallel solo and side project career alongside GBV releases for the remainder of that band's existence.  These records were primarily self-released. Because GBV alumni were regularly featured, and songs from these albums were frequently included in GBV setlists, they are informally considered to be part of the GBV canon. Also in 1995, the band contributed the song \"Sensational Gravity Boy\" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n===Major label (1997\u20132001)===\nPollard created a new incarnation of Guided by Voices with [[Cleveland]] [[glam rock]]ers [[Cobra Verde (band)|Cobra Verde]] in 1997. The following album ''[[Mag Earwhig!]]'', combined a new hard-rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track, \"[[Jane of the Waking Universe]]\", that featured the classic lineup for one last time.  However, after another year of rigorous touring, the \"Guided by Verde\" lineup split in late 1997 following Pollard's announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next Guided by Voices project.\n\nCobra Verde's [[Doug Gillard]] was tapped for yet another new Guided by Voices lineup in 1998, which also included \"classic\"-era bassist [[Greg Demos]], former [[The Breeders|Breeders]] drummer [[Jim Macpherson]], and eventually, former [[The Amps|Amps]]/Breeders guitarist [[The Amps|Nate Farley]]. Departing from Matador, this lineup (without Farley) worked with producer [[Ric Ocasek]] to create what was intended to be Guided by Voices' [[major label]] debut.  Initially produced for [[Capitol Records]], ''[[Do the Collapse]]'' was repeatedly delayed and finally released in mid-1999 on pseudo-indie label [[TVT Records|TVT]].  (In the UK it was released on [[Creation Records]]). Featuring a slick, heavily processed sound previously foreign to GBV albums, ''Do the Collapse'' failed to garner radio airplay, and was for the most part greeted with mixed reviews.\n\nThrough touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000, Guided by Voices' live act became legendary, with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark, and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs, Pollard solo tracks, impromptu covers of [[The Who]], [[David Bowie]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption.  In addition to multiple swings through the United States and Europe, 2000 saw the band's first and only visits to Australia and Japan. 2000 was capped with the release of the massive ''[[Suitcase: Failed Experiments and Trashed Aircraft|Suitcase]]'', a four-disc, 100-song trawl through three decades worth of Pollard's enormous reserve of unreleased material. (Three more box sets of unreleased songs, ''[[Suitcase 2: American Superdream Wow|Suitcase 2]]'', ''[[Suitcase 3: Up We Go Now|Suitcase 3]]'' and  ''[[Suitcase 4: Captain Kangaroo Won The War|Suitcase 4]]'' released in October 2005, November 2009 and November 2015 respectively.)\n\n2001's ''[[Isolation Drills]]'' was recorded with [[Rob Schnapf]],<ref name=BOMB-IsolationDrills-2001>{{cite journal|last1=McGonigal|first1=Mike|title=Robert Pollard|journal=[[Bomb (magazine)|BOMB]]|date=Summer 2001|issue=76|page=32\u201337|url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/robert-pollard/|publisher=New Art Publications}}</ref> who aimed to capture the band's live sound more closely than did Ocasek. Though the album debuted in ''Billboard'''s top 200 and received higher critical notices than its predecessor, it did not achieve the sought-after radio breakthrough.\n\n===Later years (2002\u20132004)===\n[[File:Robert pollard 0001.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Robert Pollard]] performing with Guided By Voices in 2014|255x255px]]\nAfter departing from TVT in 2002, Guided by Voices returned to Matador and released ''[[Universal Truths and Cycles]]'', a departure from the previous two radio-aspiring albums, and a return to the band's mid-90's, mid-fi aesthetic. ''Universal Truths'' producer [[Todd Tobias]] would also record the band's final two albums for Matador. 2003 saw the release of the prog-styled ''[[Earthquake Glue]]'', followed by the anthology box set ''[[Hardcore UFOs: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere]]'' and the [[greatest hits]] compilation ''[[Best of Guided by Voices: Human Amusements at Hourly Rates]]''.\n\nIn 2004, Pollard announced he was disbanding Guided by Voices<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |title=Special Announcement From Guided By Voices |publisher=Gbv.com |accessdate=2012-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315062433/http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |archivedate=2012-03-15 }}</ref> following the release of the ''[[Half-Smiles of the Decomposed]]'' LP, and a final farewell tour. Pollard stated:\n\n:\"This feels like the last album for Guided by Voices. I've always said that when I make a record that I'm totally satisfied with as befitting a final album, then that will be it. And this is it.\"\n\nGuided by Voices would go on to release no less than 15 more studio albums (since ''[[Surrender Your Poppy Field]]''')'''''.\n\nOn November 9, 2004, Guided by Voices performed on the stage of [[Austin City Limits]], broadcast by [[PBS]] on January 22, 2005. Their last television appearance was on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on December 2, 2004. They played the single, \"Everybody Thinks I'm a Raincloud (When I'm Not Looking)\".  After a select round of final US shows, Guided by Voices played their final show at The Metro in Chicago on December 31, 2004.  The four-hour, 63-song marathon finale is documented on the DVD ''The Electrifying Conclusion''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gbvdb.com/album.asp?albumid=2184 |title=The Electrifying Conclusion |publisher=Gbvdb.com |date=1994-01-15 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref>\n\n===Post-GBV (2005\u20132009)===\nPollard released his first post-GBV album in 2006 on [[Merge Records]].  The album, titled ''[[From a Compound Eye]]'' was a double LP produced by [[Todd Tobias]]. Later Pollard albums have been released on Merge and Pollard's own label, Guided by Voices Inc.\n\nFollowing GBV's demise, Pollard was frequently asked about band reunions. In 2007 he told [[Magnet (magazine)|''MAGNET'']]: \"To me, it\u2019s just cashing in. If you\u2019re gonna get the band back together, it should be to support a new record, not just to play the hits. That\u2019s like doing the county-fair circuit. I don\u2019t see Guided By Voices reforming. For one thing, there were 50 or 60 people in Guided By Voices over time.\"<ref>[http://magnetmagazine.com/interviews/rpollard.html Magnetmagazine.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827212250/http://magnetmagazine.com/interviews/rpollard.html |date=August 27, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nPollard also commented on the fact that GBV and his solo output are basicially the same, when he told [[Harp Magazine|''Harp'']] magazine, in 2005, \"You know, a lot of people try to distinguish things between what is Robert Pollard and what is Guided By Voices.
