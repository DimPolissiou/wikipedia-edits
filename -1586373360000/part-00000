One of nine children, he was known by his second Christian name, John, as all the male members of the family were named William. He was the brother of Charlotte Denison, future wife of [[Evelyn Denison, 1st Viscount Ossington]].\n\nCavendish-Scott-Bentinck was educated at home rather than at school. Known as Lord John Bentinck, he served in the army from 1818, entering as an [[Ensign (rank)#United Kingdom|ensign]] in the [[Foot Guards]] and later transferred to the 7th Light Dragoon Guards in 1821, where he became a captain, then the [[Life Guards (British Army)|2nd Life Guards]] in 1823.

His ailments included short-term memory loss and [[sciatica]].\n\nOn 27 March 1854, he succeeded his father as 5th [[Duke of Portland]]. Although the title also gave him a seat in the [[House of Lords]], it took him three years to take his seat, not taking the oaths until 5 June 1857. He showed little interest in taking an active role in politics, although he supported the [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]] and [[Robert Peel]]. From 1859 until his death he was also Deputy [[Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire]].\n\n==Welbeck Abbey==\nThe duke's major building operations and developments at his estate of [[Welbeck Abbey]] in which he took an active involvement appealed strongly to the popular imagination. They cost an enormous sum of money and employed thousands of men from the local area, both skilled and unskilled. While there were occasional labour disputes over wages and hours, the duke was on very good terms with his many employees and earned the nickname \"the workman's friend\".\n\n===Grounds===\nThe house's [[kitchen garden]]s covered {{convert|22|acre|abbr=on}} encased in high walls with recesses in which [[brazier]]s could be put to ripen fruit. One of the walls, for peaches, measured over {{convert|1000|ft|abbr=on}} in length.\n\nAn immense riding house was constructed, {{convert|396|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|108|ft|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|50|ft|abbr=on}} high. It was lit by 4,000 gas jets. His stables held 100 horses but he never rode them in his riding house.\n\nWhen [[roller skating]] became popular, he had a rink installed near the lake for the benefit of his staff, whom he encouraged to use it.\n\n===House===\nThe duke had all the rooms of [[Welbeck Abbey]] stripped of furniture, including [[tapestry|tapestries]] and [[portrait]]s, which he had stored elsewhere. He occupied a suite of four or five rooms in the west wing of the mansion which were sparsely furnished. By 1879, the building was in a state of disrepair, with the duke's rooms the only habitable ones. All the rooms had been painted pink, with bare [[parquetry]] floors and no furniture apart from a commode in one corner.<ref name=\"nottingham\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mss/collections/family-estate/collections/portland/5th_duke_portland_full.phtml|title=Family and Estate Collections introduction|publisher=[[University of Nottingham]]}}</ref>\n\n===Underground===\nThe duke's father, believing there would be a shortage of oak, had hundreds of trees planted. His son used the wood to construct a complex of underground rooms and tunnels.<ref name=\"times\"/> The tunnels under the estate were reputed to have totalled {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}}, connecting various underground chambers and above-ground buildings. They included a {{convert|1000|yd|abbr=on}} long tunnel between the house and the riding house, wide enough for several people to walk side by side. A more roughly constructed tunnel ran parallel to this for the use of his workmen. A {{convert|1.25|mi|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} long tunnel ran north-east from the coach house, to emerge at the south Lodge, which was supposedly wide enough for two [[carriage]]s. It had domed skylights (readily visible on the surface) and by night was illuminated by [[Gas lighting|gaslight]].<ref>This and other tunnels are shown on the {{gbmaprim|SK561745|Ordnance Survey Explorer map}} of the area, though only the largest can be readily seen on aerial photographs ([http://www.multimap.com/map/photo.cgi?client=public&X=457000.661155821&Y=375000.190126423&width=700&height=410&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&pc=&zm=0&scale=25000&multimap.x=244&multimap.y=222 Multimap]).</ref>\n\nThe underground chambers\u2014all of which were painted pink\u2014included a great hall {{convert|160|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|63|ft|abbr=on}} which was originally intended as a chapel, but which was instead used as a picture gallery and occasionally as a ballroom. The ballroom reportedly had a [[hydraulic]] lift that could carry 20 guests from the surface and a ceiling that was painted as a giant sunset. The duke never organised any dances in the ballroom.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/09/billionaires-basements-london-houses-architecture |title=Billionaires' basements: the luxury bunkers making holes in London streets |accessdate=15 July 2013 |work=The Guardian |first=Oliver |last=Wainwright |date=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nOther subterranean rooms included a {{convert|250|ft|abbr=on}} long library, an [[observatory]] with a large glass roof, and a vast [[billiards]] room.\n\n==Eccentricity==\nThe duke was highly [[introvert]]ed and well known for his eccentricity; he did not want to meet people and never invited anyone to his home. He employed hundreds through his various construction projects, and though well paid, the employees were not allowed to speak to him or acknowledge him. The one worker who raised his hat to the duke was promptly dismissed. The [[tenant farmer|tenants]] on his estates were aware of his wishes and knew they were required to ignore him if they passed by.<ref name=\"times\"/> His rooms had double letterboxes, one for in-coming and another for out-going mail. Only his [[valet]] was permitted to see him in person in his quarters\u2014he would not even let the doctor in, while his tenants and workmen received all their instructions in writing.\n\nHis business with his solicitors, agents, and the occasional politician was handled by post. The duke maintained an extensive correspondence with a wide-ranging network of family and friends, including [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]. He is not known to have kept company with any ladies and his shyness and introverted personality increased over time. His reclusive lifestyle led to rumours that the duke was disfigured, mad, or prone to wild orgies, but contemporary witnesses and surviving photographs present him as a normal-looking man.\n\nHe ventured outside mainly by night, when he was preceded by a lady servant carrying a [[lantern]] {{convert|40|yd|m}} ahead of him. If he did walk out by day, the duke wore two overcoats, an extremely tall hat, an extremely high collar, and carried a very large umbrella<ref name=\"nottingham\"/> behind which he tried to hide if someone addressed him.\n\nIf the duke had business in London, he would take his carriage to [[Worksop]] where he had it loaded onto a railway wagon. Upon his arrival at his London residence, [[Harcourt House, London|Harcourt House]] in [[Cavendish Square]], all the household staff were ordered to keep out of sight as he hurried into his study through the front hall.\n\nHe insisted on a chicken roasting at all hours of the day and the servants brought him his food on heated trucks that ran on rails through the tunnels.\n\n==Children==\n\nThere is evidence to believe that the duke had a daughter, Fanny (later Fanny Lawson; 1855\u20131917), and possibly two sons, William (c. 1852\u20131870) and Joseph, all of them illegitimate. Fanny had two sons, George and Bertram Lawson, both of whom served with distinction in the military during [[World War I]], and has numerous descendants living today.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Dead Duke, His Secret Wife and the Missing Corpse: An extraordinary Edwardian case of deception and intrigue | author=Piu Marie Eatwell | publisher=Liveright Publishing Corporation | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-63149-123-8 | pages=268\u2013299 }}</ref>  The duke had numerous intimate and discreet relationships during his lifetime, and his family was told that due to an accident in his youth he would probably be unable to have children.

He was buried in a simple grave in a large plot at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] in north London. As his younger brother, Henry William, had died without male issue on 31 December 1870, the title of Duke of Portland devolved upon his cousin, [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland|William Cavendish-Bentinck]].\n\nThe department of [[Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham]] holds a number of papers relating to the 5th Duke: the 5th Duke's personal and political papers (Pw K) are part of the Portland (Welbeck) Collection; and the Portland (London) Collection (Pl) contains papers relating to the estate business of the 5th Duke, and to the \"[[William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland#Druce case|Druce Case]]\". [[Harley Gallery and Foundation|The Harley Gallery]] shows exhibitions from the Portland Collection, in the museum which is situated in the converted site of the Fifth Duke's Gas Works.\n\nThe Portland Estate Papers held at the Nottinghamshire Archives also contain items relating to the 5th Duke's properties.\n\n==Druce case==\nIn 1897, a widow, Anna Maria Druce, claimed that the duke had led a double life as her father-in-law, a London upholsterer by the name of Thomas Charles Druce, who had supposedly died in 1864. The widow claimed that the duke had faked the death of his [[alter ego]] Druce to return to a secluded aristocratic life and that therefore her son was heir to the Portland estate. Her application to have Druce's grave in [[Highgate Cemetery]] opened to show that the coffin buried in it was empty and weighted with lead was blocked by Druce's [[executor]]. The case became the subject of continuing and unsuccessful legal proceedings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscriptsandspecialcollections/exhibitions/online/fromparchmenttopixels/thedrucecase.aspx|title=The Druce Case|publisher=[[University of Nottingham]]}}</ref>\n\nWhen it was discovered that Druce's children by a former wife were living in [[Australia]], Anna Maria Druce's claims were backgrounded, but she was placed in an asylum in 1903.<ref name=masters/><ref>{{cite book | title=The London compendium: a street-by-street exploration of the hidden metropolis | author=Ed Glinert | publisher=Penguin| year=2004 | isbn=0-14-101213-7 }}</ref> The case was taken up by George Hollamby Druce from 1903 onwards, who set up companies to finance his legal proceedings in 1905, and in 1907 even instituted a charge of perjury against Herbert Druce, the elder son of Thomas Charles Druce by his second wife, for having sworn that he had witnessed his father's death in 1864. Herbert had been born before his parents' marriage and thus was not eligible to claim the Portland title even if his father had been the duke.\n\nThe photograph which illustrates this article is that produced by the prosecution as being of the duke, but the defence denied this and said it was of Druce.

All the rooms had been painted pink, with bare [[parquetry]] floors and no furniture apart from a commode in one corner.<ref name=\"nottingham\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mss/collections/family-estate/collections/portland/5th_duke_portland_full.phtml|title=Family and Estate Collections introduction|publisher=[[University of Nottingham]]}}</ref>\n\n===Underground===\nThe duke's father, believing there would be a shortage of oak, had hundreds of trees planted. His son used the wood to construct a complex of underground rooms and tunnels.<ref name=\"times\"/> The tunnels under the estate were reputed to have totalled {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}}, connecting various underground chambers and above-ground buildings. They included a {{convert|1000|yd|abbr=on}} long tunnel between the house and the riding house, wide enough for several people to walk side by side. A more roughly constructed tunnel ran parallel to this for the use of his workmen. A {{convert|1.25|mi|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} long tunnel ran north-east from the coach house, to emerge at the south Lodge, which was supposedly wide enough for two [[carriage]]s. It had domed skylights (readily visible on the surface) and by night was illuminated by [[Gas lighting|gaslight]].<ref>This and other tunnels are shown on the {{gbmaprim|SK561745|Ordnance Survey Explorer map}} of the area, though only the largest can be readily seen on aerial photographs ([http://www.multimap.com/map/photo.cgi?client=public&X=457000.661155821&Y=375000.190126423&width=700&height=410&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&pc=&zm=0&scale=25000&multimap.x=244&multimap.y=222 Multimap]).</ref>\n\nThe underground chambers\u2014all of which were painted pink\u2014included a great hall {{convert|160|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|63|ft|abbr=on}} which was originally intended as a chapel, but which was instead used as a picture gallery and occasionally as a ballroom. The ballroom reportedly had a [[hydraulic]] lift that could carry 20 guests from the surface and a ceiling that was painted as a giant sunset. The duke never organised any dances in the ballroom.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/09/billionaires-basements-london-houses-architecture |title=Billionaires' basements: the luxury bunkers making holes in London streets |accessdate=15 July 2013 |work=The Guardian |first=Oliver |last=Wainwright |date=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nOther subterranean rooms included a {{convert|250|ft|abbr=on}} long library, an [[observatory]] with a large glass roof, and a vast [[billiards]] room.\n\n==Eccentricity==\nThe duke was highly [[introvert]]ed and well known for his eccentricity; he did not want to meet people and never invited anyone to his home. He employed hundreds through his various construction projects, and though well paid, the employees were not allowed to speak to him or acknowledge him. The one worker who raised his hat to the duke was promptly dismissed. The [[tenant farmer|tenants]] on his estates were aware of his wishes and knew they were required to ignore him if they passed by.<ref name=\"times\"/> His rooms had double letterboxes, one for in-coming and another for out-going mail. Only his [[valet]] was permitted to see him in person in his quarters\u2014he would not even let the doctor in, while his tenants and workmen received all their instructions in writing.\n\nHis business with his solicitors, agents, and the occasional politician was handled by post. The duke maintained an extensive correspondence with a wide-ranging network of family and friends, including [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]. He is not known to have kept company with any ladies and his shyness and introverted personality increased over time. His reclusive lifestyle led to rumours that the duke was disfigured, mad, or prone to wild orgies, but contemporary witnesses and surviving photographs present him as a normal-looking man.\n\nHe ventured outside mainly by night, when he was preceded by a lady servant carrying a [[lantern]] {{convert|40|yd|m}} ahead of him. If he did walk out by day, the duke wore two overcoats, an extremely tall hat, an extremely high collar, and carried a very large umbrella<ref name=\"nottingham\"/> behind which he tried to hide if someone addressed him.\n\nIf the duke had business in London, he would take his carriage to [[Worksop]] where he had it loaded onto a railway wagon. Upon his arrival at his London residence, [[Harcourt House, London|Harcourt House]] in [[Cavendish Square]], all the household staff were ordered to keep out of sight as he hurried into his study through the front hall.\n\nHe insisted on a chicken roasting at all hours of the day and the servants brought him his food on heated trucks that ran on rails through the tunnels.\n\n==Children==\n\nThere is evidence to believe that the duke had a daughter, Fanny (later Fanny Lawson; 1855\u20131917), and possibly two sons, William (c. 1852\u20131870) and Joseph, all of them illegitimate. Fanny had two sons, George and Bertram Lawson, both of whom served with distinction in the military during [[World War I]], and has numerous descendants living today.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Dead Duke, His Secret Wife and the Missing Corpse: An extraordinary Edwardian case of deception and intrigue | author=Piu Marie Eatwell | publisher=Liveright Publishing Corporation | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-63149-123-8 | pages=268\u2013299 }}</ref>  The duke had numerous intimate and discreet relationships during his lifetime, and his family was told that due to an accident in his youth he would probably be unable to have children.

He was buried in a simple grave in a large plot at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] in north London. As his younger brother, Henry William, had died without male issue on 31 December 1870, the title of Duke of Portland devolved upon his cousin, [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland|William Cavendish-Bentinck]].\n\nThe department of [[Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham]] holds a number of papers relating to the 5th Duke: the 5th Duke's personal and political papers (Pw K) are part of the Portland (Welbeck) Collection; and the Portland (London) Collection (Pl) contains papers relating to the estate business of the 5th Duke, and to the \"[[William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland#Druce case|Druce Case]]\". [[Harley Gallery and Foundation|The Harley Gallery]] shows exhibitions from the Portland Collection, in the museum which is situated in the converted site of the Fifth Duke's Gas Works.\n\nThe Portland Estate Papers held at the Nottinghamshire Archives also contain items relating to the 5th Duke's properties.\n\n==Druce case==\nIn 1897, a widow, Anna Maria Druce, claimed that the duke had led a double life as her father-in-law, a London upholsterer by the name of Thomas Charles Druce, who had supposedly died in 1864. The widow claimed that the duke had faked the death of his [[alter ego]] Druce to return to a secluded aristocratic life and that therefore her son was heir to the Portland estate. Her application to have Druce's grave in [[Highgate Cemetery]] opened to show that the coffin buried in it was empty and weighted with lead was blocked by Druce's [[executor]]. The case became the subject of continuing and unsuccessful legal proceedings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscriptsandspecialcollections/exhibitions/online/fromparchmenttopixels/thedrucecase.aspx|title=The Druce Case|publisher=[[University of Nottingham]]}}</ref>\n\nWhen it was discovered that Druce's children by a former wife were living in [[Australia]], Anna Maria Druce's claims were backgrounded, but she was placed in an asylum in 1903.<ref name=masters/><ref>{{cite book | title=The London compendium: a street-by-street exploration of the hidden metropolis | author=Ed Glinert | publisher=Penguin| year=2004 | isbn=0-14-101213-7 }}</ref> The case was taken up by George Hollamby Druce from 1903 onwards, who set up companies to finance his legal proceedings in 1905, and in 1907 even instituted a charge of perjury against Herbert Druce, the elder son of Thomas Charles Druce by his second wife, for having sworn that he had witnessed his father's death in 1864. Herbert had been born before his parents' marriage and thus was not eligible to claim the Portland title even if his father had been the duke.\n\nThe photograph which illustrates this article is that produced by the prosecution as being of the duke, but the defence denied this and said it was of Druce.

He stood successfully for Parliament: for [[Hedon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hedon]] (1820\u20131830), [[Inverness Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Inverness Burghs]] (1830\u20131831) and again for Inverness Burghs (1832 \u2013 20 April 1833).\n\nHe was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1817.<ref>[http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/about-us/fellowship/Fellows1660-2007.pdf Complete List of Royal Society Fellows 1660-2007]</ref>\nIn 1823 he became a director of the East India Company, and was willing use his influence in Parliament to support the Companies interests.{{sfn|Casey|2009}}\n\n==Works==\nWhile professor, John Baillie wrote:{{sfn|Lane-Poole|1885|p=418}}\n*''Sixty Tables elucidatory of a Course of Lectures on Arabic Grammar delivered in the College of Fort William during the first year of its institution'' (first edition 1801)\n*'''The Five Books upon Arabic Grammar'', i.e. the \"Meeut \u00c2mel\", \"Shurhu Meeut \u00c2mel\", \"Mesb\u00e2h\", \"Hed\u00e2yut oon-Nuhve\", and the \"K\u00e2feea\", of which the first four were issued in two thin volumes in 1802-3, and the last had not been published by 1900.\n\nBaillie also translated from the Arabic part (relating to commercial transactions) of a digest of Mohammedan law in 1797, at the request of Sir [[John Shore, 1st Baron Teignmouth|John Shore]] (Lord Teignmouth), the then governor-general, but the work was never completed.{{sfn|Lane-Poole|1885|p=418}}\n\nBaillie's position as Resident in Lucknow allowed him to amass a large collection of manuscripts, many of which later passed to the [[Edinburgh University Library]] in 1876, where they were catalogued by Edward Robertson in 1912. He is best known for his collection of paintings and illustrated manuscripts, such as the ''[[Jami al-Tawarikh]]'', and the poems of [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] of [[Sharaz]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Press Cutting - Morning Post 22 April 1833 - Deaths==\nOn the 20th inst., at his house in Devonshire-place, in the 61st year of his age, Colonel John Baillie, of Leys, Inverness-shire, M.P. for the Inverness District of Burghs and a Director of the East India Company.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation |last=Casey |first=Martin |contribution=Baillie, John (1772-1833), of Leys Castle, Inverness and Devonshire Place, Mdx. |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/baillie-john-1772-1833|title=The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1820-1832 |editor-first=D.R. |editor-last=Fisher |year=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}\n*{{ODNBweb|last=Lane-Poole |first=Stanley |last2=Falkner |first2=James (reviewer) |year=2004 |title=Baillie, John (1772\u20131833)|id=1064}}\n\n'''Attribution'''\n*{{DNB|last=Lane-Poole |first=Stanley |wstitle=Baillie, John (1772-1833) |volume=2|page=418}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*{{Citation |last=Blair |first=Sheila |year = 1995 | author2 = Nasser D.

He was then sent to [[Harrow School]], from which he was also expelled after three terms. He was then educated by a disparate series of private tutors whom he tormented with [[practical joke]]s that included leaving a horse in one tutor's bedroom.\n\nDespite having achieved very little academically, Mytton was granted entry to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He [[matriculation|matriculated]] in January 1816 but, according to ''[[Alumni Cantabrigienses]]'', it is doubtful that he took up his place,<ref name=\"venn\">{{acad |id=MTN816J |name=Mytton, John}}</ref> although there are claims that he took 2,000 bottles of [[port wine|port]] to sustain himself during his studies. He certainly was not awarded a degree,<ref name=\"venn\"/> having found university life boring, and embarked on a [[Grand Tour]].\n\n==Military service==\nMytton saw both part-time and full-time military service.  In 1812, when he was 16, he was commissioned as captain in a local [[yeomanry]] regiment, the Oswestry Rangers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gladstone|first=E.

As a [[Cornet (military rank)|cornet]], he spent a year with the regiment in France as part of the army of occupation after the defeat of [[Napoleon I]], spending his time gambling and drinking before resigning his commission. He rejoined the North Shropshire Yeomanry after his subsequent return to England and was promoted to major in 1822. He had attempted in vain to lobby its colonel for an even higher rank in the place of an uncle, William Owen, who had left the regiment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gladstone|first=E.

During two combat tours, he shot down nine enemy aircraft to become a [[flying ace]].\n\nHe was an early member of the [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration squadron and flew the lead \"solo\" position. His work as a [[test pilot]] included aircraft, electronic systems, and operational tactics such as developing techniques for delivering nuclear weapons from small fighter aircraft. He commanded increasingly larger air units including [[VFA-11|VF-11]] and Carrier Air Group Ten as well as training organizations that helped the Navy transition from propeller to jet aircraft. He commanded two Navy ships, served as the head of Navy Fighter Design, and was a key contributor to fighter studies that resulted in the development of jet aircraft that {{as of|2015|lc=y}} are still in active service.\n\nFeightner was the only pilot to land the dash-1 variant of the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] aboard a carrier. He led VF-11 to become the first Atlantic fleet unit in which every pilot received the coveted \"E\" award in a single exercise. After retiring from the Navy, Feightner promoted aviation and shared his experiences with others.\n\n==Early life==\nFeightner was born on October 14, 1919 in [[Lima, Ohio]], a small town in the northwest part of the state, to Amos Evan and Mary Story (Roths) Feightner.{{sfnp|Wooldridge|1993|p=78}}<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=stpsnwT7jFoC&pg=PA510&dq=%22Amos+Evan+and+Mary+Story+(Roths)+Feightner%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBv8Th7M7oAhULheAKHd7BA9sQ6AEwAHoECAIQAQ]</ref> He attended [[Findlay College]] in Findlay, Ohio{{sfnp|Astor|2005|p=3}} and learned to fly in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP).

Feightner also tested the [[Grumman F8F Bearcat]], the [[Vought F4U Corsair]], and the [[Grumman F7F Tigercat]].<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p12>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |page=12}}</ref> When Colonel [[Charles Lindbergh]] came to evaluate the Tigercat, Feightner, as F7F project pilot, provided the pre-flight instruction.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_pp_14_15>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |pages=14&ndash;15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:F7U-1 CVB-41 landing 1951.jpg|left|thumb|Feightner landing F7U-1, No. 415, on the USS Midway in 1951]]\nFeightner was assigned as the Navy's project pilot for the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]], a carrier-based jet [[fighter-bomber]] with [[swept wing]]s and an unusual [[Tailless aircraft|tailless]] design.{{sfnp|Powell|2008|p=37}} From July 23 to August 14, 1951, he performed carrier suitability tests of the Cutlass on board the {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}}.{{sfnp|Gardner|2010|p=72}} Feightner survived a number of near-fatal incidents in the Cutlass. During a test using the NAS Patuxent River air field catapult, an engine exploded and caught fire on takeoff. Unable to eject at such a low altitude, Feightner made use of a low spot in the river bank to turn the aircraft and return safely to the field where firefighters extinguished the burning engine.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=82}} On July 23, 1951, he performed the first (and only) carrier takeoff and landing of the dash-1 variant on the aircraft carrier USS ''Midway''.{{sfnp|Powell|2008|p=37}} Landing the Cutlass was hazardous due to the extreme nose-up attitude that restricted visibility forward and below. Feightner was unable to see the flight deck and relied on the [[Landing Signal Officer]] (LSO) to provide the indication to reduce engine power. Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly [[ramp strike|struck the ramp]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=83}} Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did not live up to its potential and remained in service less than four years.{{sfnp|Grossnick|1995|p=481}}\n\n===Blue Angels===\nIn January 1952, Feightner received orders to the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron&mdash;the Blue Angels. The squadron had been directed to add the Cutlass to their performance although neither Feightner nor Blue Angels commander [[Roy Marlin Voris|\"Butch\" Voris]] believed the aircraft was ready for formation flying.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}} The F7U was the Navy's first operational aircraft fitted with a hydraulic [[flight control system]] and reliability was still poor.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=46}} In the event of failure, the mechanical backup system required eleven seconds before control was restored.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=47}} The solution was to fly the F7Us separately from the rest of the team thereby creating the diamond and solo roles that remain to the present day. Feightner recruited former Blue Angel Lt. Harding C. \"Mac\" Macknight to fly the second Cutlass.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}}\n\n[[File:F7U-1 Blue Angels 1952.jpg|right|thumb|Blue Angels F7U-1 Cutlass in 1952]]\nAt the start of the 1952 show season, fuel control problems grounded the team's [[Grumman F9F Panther]]s leaving the Cutlasses to put on the primary demonstration between March and June.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=50}} During a show at [[Saufley Field]] in Florida, Feightner experienced a total loss of hydraulics on a full afterburner takeoff and steep climb. While trying to gain enough altitude for ejection he was able to stay with the aircraft until the back up control system engaged. He clipped trees on the end of the runway, causing the left engine to flame out. With hydraulic fluid streaming back in a bright flame, he made a hard turn and got the plane back on the runway, much to the excitement of the crowd.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=49}} Feightner and Macknight performed maneuvers that showed off the best attributes of the F7U. The two solos would approach each other from opposite ends of the runway and, after passing each other, would roll the aircraft, deploy [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]], and light [[afterburner]]s. In Feightner's opinion, \"There just is not an airplane like it anywhere.\"{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=51}}\n\nMaintenance issues and additional near-fatal accidents put an end to Blue Angel Cutlass performances.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=52}} While traveling to an airshow at [[Naval Air Station Glenview]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], both F7Us experienced in-flight emergencies. One of Feightner's engines failed shortly after takeoff, but before he could land, Macknight's right engine caught fire and the left engine quit soon after. Although Feightner called for him to eject, Macknight stayed with the burning aircraft and landed at Glenview.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=53}} With the runway closed, Feightner was redirected to make his landing at Chicago's former Orchard Airpark, which had been expanded and renamed [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]] after Feightner's former VF-3 commander. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=86}} After yet another in-flight emergency resulted in a forced landing at [[Naval Air Station Memphis]], the F7Us were given to the station's training center.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=56}}\n\n===Return to testing===\nIn September 1952, Feightner returned to flight test as the development officer for Air Development Squadron Three ([[VX-3 (Squadron)|VX-3]]).<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6/> VX-3 was located at [[Atlantic City Air National Guard Base|NAS Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], and was responsible for testing fighter aircraft, systems, and munitions.{{sfnp|Lurie|2004|p=48}} In this new role, he tested aircraft systems (rather than the airplanes themselves) and determined what tactics would most effectively utilize those systems.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6>{{cite book |last = Eanett |title=Interview Transcript |year=2005 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nOn December 3, 1953, Feightner participated in the first public demonstration of the [[Aircraft catapult#Steam catapult|steam catapult]] chosen  to launch heavy jet aircraft from the short decks of aircraft carriers. Flying a propeller-driven [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|AD Skyraider]] at the [[Naval Air Material Center]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Feightner described the steam-powered launch as \"much better for the pilot\" due to the relatively gentle start that eliminated the shock of other catapult techniques.<ref name=NAN_Feb_54>{{cite journal |last= |first=|date=February 1954 |title=From David to Brown |journal=Naval Aviation News |volume= |issue= |pages=1&ndash;2 |publisher=United States Navy |location=Washington, D.C. |doi= |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1954/feb54.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201231458/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1954/feb54.pdf |archivedate=December 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFeightner contributed to the development of weapon delivery tactics for the [[McDonnell F2H Banshee]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=98}} The F2H-2B was modified for the attack role and had strengthened wings and pylons to accommodate a heavy weapon such as the  [[Mark 7 nuclear bomb|Mark 7]] or [[Mark 8 nuclear bomb]].{{sfnp|Francillon|1990|p=81}} The F2H-2B testing on which Feightner worked included the longest non-stop, round trip flight from a carrier&mdash;more than 2,800 miles. He also participated in an 18-hour, low-level, non-stop, round-trip flight from a carrier with weapon delivery in a Douglas AD-3 Skyraider.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=98}}\n\n==Aviation commands==\n\n===VF-11 Red Rippers===\n[[File:VF11 Rippers Aerial Bombing 1956.png|left|thumb|VF-11 pilots receive \"E\" award for aerial bombing.

During two combat tours, he shot down nine enemy aircraft to become a [[flying ace]].\n\nHe was an early member of the [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration squadron and flew the lead \"solo\" position. His work as a [[test pilot]] included aircraft, electronic systems, and operational tactics such as developing techniques for delivering nuclear weapons from small fighter aircraft. He commanded increasingly larger air units including [[VFA-11|VF-11]] and Carrier Air Group Ten as well as training organizations that helped the Navy transition from propeller to jet aircraft. He commanded two Navy ships, served as the head of Navy Fighter Design, and was a key contributor to fighter studies that resulted in the development of jet aircraft that {{as of|2015|lc=y}} are still in active service.\n\nFeightner was the only pilot to land the dash-1 variant of the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] aboard a carrier. He led VF-11 to become the first Atlantic fleet unit in which every pilot received the coveted \"E\" award in a single exercise. After retiring from the Navy, Feightner promoted aviation and shared his experiences with others.\n\n==Early life==\nFeightner was born on October 14, 1919 in [[Lima, Ohio]], a small town in the northwest part of the state, to Amos Evan and Mary Story (Roths) Feightner.{{sfnp|Wooldridge|1993|p=78}}<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=stpsnwT7jFoC&pg=PA510&dq=%22Amos+Evan+and+Mary+Story+(Roths)+Feightner%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBv8Th7M7oAhULheAKHd7BA9sQ6AEwAHoECAIQAQ]</ref> He attended [[Findlay College]] in Findlay, Ohio{{sfnp|Astor|2005|p=3}} and learned to fly in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP).

But he faced an eight-month delay before acceptance since the Army flight program could not cope with the large influx of people.

Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly [[ramp strike|struck the ramp]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=83}} Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did not live up to its potential and remained in service less than four years.{{sfnp|Grossnick|1995|p=481}}\n\n===Blue Angels===\nIn January 1952, Feightner received orders to the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron&mdash;the Blue Angels. The squadron had been directed to add the Cutlass to their performance although neither Feightner nor Blue Angels commander [[Roy Marlin Voris|\"Butch\" Voris]] believed the aircraft was ready for formation flying.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}} The F7U was the Navy's first operational aircraft fitted with a hydraulic [[flight control system]] and reliability was still poor.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=46}} In the event of failure, the mechanical backup system required eleven seconds before control was restored.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=47}} The solution was to fly the F7Us separately from the rest of the team thereby creating the diamond and solo roles that remain to the present day. Feightner recruited former Blue Angel Lt. Harding C. \"Mac\" Macknight to fly the second Cutlass.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}}\n\n[[File:F7U-1 Blue Angels 1952.jpg|right|thumb|Blue Angels F7U-1 Cutlass in 1952]]\nAt the start of the 1952 show season, fuel control problems grounded the team's [[Grumman F9F Panther]]s leaving the Cutlasses to put on the primary demonstration between March and June.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=50}} During a show at [[Saufley Field]] in Florida, Feightner experienced a total loss of hydraulics on a full afterburner takeoff and steep climb. While trying to gain enough altitude for ejection he was able to stay with the aircraft until the back up control system engaged. He clipped trees on the end of the runway, causing the left engine to flame out. With hydraulic fluid streaming back in a bright flame, he made a hard turn and got the plane back on the runway, much to the excitement of the crowd.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=49}} Feightner and Macknight performed maneuvers that showed off the best attributes of the F7U. The two solos would approach each other from opposite ends of the runway and, after passing each other, would roll the aircraft, deploy [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]], and light [[afterburner]]s. In Feightner's opinion, \"There just is not an airplane like it anywhere.\"{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=51}}\n\nMaintenance issues and additional near-fatal accidents put an end to Blue Angel Cutlass performances.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=52}} While traveling to an airshow at [[Naval Air Station Glenview]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], both F7Us experienced in-flight emergencies. One of Feightner's engines failed shortly after takeoff, but before he could land, Macknight's right engine caught fire and the left engine quit soon after. Although Feightner called for him to eject, Macknight stayed with the burning aircraft and landed at Glenview.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=53}} With the runway closed, Feightner was redirected to make his landing at Chicago's former Orchard Airpark, which had been expanded and renamed [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]] after Feightner's former VF-3 commander. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=86}} After yet another in-flight emergency resulted in a forced landing at [[Naval Air Station Memphis]], the F7Us were given to the station's training center.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=56}}\n\n===Return to testing===\nIn September 1952, Feightner returned to flight test as the development officer for Air Development Squadron Three ([[VX-3 (Squadron)|VX-3]]).<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6/> VX-3 was located at [[Atlantic City Air National Guard Base|NAS Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], and was responsible for testing fighter aircraft, systems, and munitions.{{sfnp|Lurie|2004|p=48}} In this new role, he tested aircraft systems (rather than the airplanes themselves) and determined what tactics would most effectively utilize those systems.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6>{{cite book |last = Eanett |title=Interview Transcript |year=2005 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nOn December 3, 1953, Feightner participated in the first public demonstration of the [[Aircraft catapult#Steam catapult|steam catapult]] chosen  to launch heavy jet aircraft from the short decks of aircraft carriers. Flying a propeller-driven [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|AD Skyraider]] at the [[Naval Air Material Center]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Feightner described the steam-powered launch as \"much better for the pilot\" due to the relatively gentle start that eliminated the shock of other catapult techniques.<ref name=NAN_Feb_54>{{cite journal |last= |first=|date=February 1954 |title=From David to Brown |journal=Naval Aviation News |volume= |issue= |pages=1&ndash;2 |publisher=United States Navy |location=Washington, D.C. |doi= |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1954/feb54.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201231458/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1954/feb54.pdf |archivedate=December 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFeightner contributed to the development of weapon delivery tactics for the [[McDonnell F2H Banshee]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=98}} The F2H-2B was modified for the attack role and had strengthened wings and pylons to accommodate a heavy weapon such as the  [[Mark 7 nuclear bomb|Mark 7]] or [[Mark 8 nuclear bomb]].{{sfnp|Francillon|1990|p=81}} The F2H-2B testing on which Feightner worked included the longest non-stop, round trip flight from a carrier&mdash;more than 2,800 miles.
