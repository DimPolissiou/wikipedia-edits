Cited as \"one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars,\"{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|loc=Google Books Introduction}} he is closely associated with the art of [[method acting]], embodying the characters he played, which at times led to clashes with directors and co-stars. He starred as [[Marlon Brando]]'s mobster brother Charley in ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954), the title character Sol Nazerman in ''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]'' (1964), and as police chief Bill Gillespie opposite [[Sidney Poitier]] in the film ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' (1967) which won him the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\nSteiger was born in [[Westhampton, New York]], the son of a [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]]. He had a difficult childhood, with an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] mother from whom he ran away at the age of 16. After serving in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific Theater]] during World War II, he began his acting career with television roles in 1947, and went on to garner critical acclaim for his portrayal of the title character in the teleplay \"[[Marty (teleplay)|Marty]]\" (1953). He made his stage debut in 1946, in a production of ''Curse you, Jack Dalton!'' at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark, and subsequently appeared in productions such as  ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1950), [[Clifford Odets]]'s ''[[Night Music (play)|Night Music]]'' (1951), ''[[Seagulls Over Sorrento#Original Play|Seagulls Over Sorrento]]'' (1952) and ''[[Rashomon (play)|Rashomon]]'' (1959).\n\nSteiger made his film debut in [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s ''[[Teresa (1951 film)|Teresa]]'' in 1951, and subsequently appeared in films such as ''[[The Big Knife]]'' (1955), ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'' (1955), ''[[Across the Bridge (film)|Across the Bridge]]'' (1957) and ''[[Al Capone (film)|Al Capone]]'' (1959). After Steiger's performance in ''The Pawnbroker'' in 1964, in which he played an embittered Jewish [[Holocaust]] survivor working as a pawnbroker in New York City, he portrayed an opportunistic Russian politician in [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1965). ''In the Heat of the Night'' (1967) won five [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steiger, who was lauded for his performance as a Mississippi police chief who learns to respect an African-American officer (Poitier) as they search for a killer. The following year, he played a serial killer of many guises in ''[[No Way to Treat a Lady (film)|No Way to Treat a Lady]]''.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Steiger increasingly turned to European productions in his search for more demanding roles. He portrayed [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' (1970), a Mexican bandit in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), [[Benito Mussolini]] in ''[[Last Days of Mussolini]]'' (1975), and ended the decade playing a disturbed priest in '' [[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (1979). By the 1980s, heart problems and depression took its toll on Steiger's career, and he found it difficult to find employment, agreeing to appear in low-budget [[B movie]]s. One of his final roles was as judge [[H. Lee Sarokin]] in the prison drama ''[[The Hurricane (1999 film)|The Hurricane]]'' (1999), which reunited him with ''In the Heat of the Night'' director [[Norman Jewison]]. Steiger was married five times, and had a daughter, opera singer [[Anna Steiger]], and a son, Michael Steiger. He died of [[pneumonia]] and kidney failure as a result of complications from surgery for a [[gall bladder]] tumor on July 9, 2002, aged 77, in Los Angeles, and was survived by his fifth wife [[Joan Benedict Steiger]].\n\n==Early life and acting background==\n[[File:West Side High Newark jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Steiger attended [[West Side High School (New Jersey)|West Side High School]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], where he showed an early interest in acting.]]\nSteiger was born on April 14, 1925 in [[Westhampton, New York]], the only child of Lorraine ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Driver) and Frederick Steiger,{{sfn|Wise|Rehill|2007|p=241}}<ref name=\"CBSNews\">{{cite web|title=Actor Rod Steiger dies|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/actor-rod-steiger-dies/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=July 9, 2002|accessdate=April 24, 2016|author=Vries, Lloyd|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424012141/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/actor-rod-steiger-dies/|archivedate=April 24, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> of [[French people|French]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Germans|German]] descent.<ref name=\"Guardian Obituary\">{{cite web|author=French, Phillip|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jul/14/features.review2|title=Steiger brought a sense of pain, guilt and authenticity to his characters|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 14, 2002|accessdate=July 14, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928052031/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jul/14/features.review2|archivedate=September 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite web|date=July 19, 2002 |title=Rod Steiger |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/07/10/db1001.xml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109233805/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2002%2F07%2F10%2Fdb1001.xml |archivedate=November 9, 2007 |accessdate=July 23, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Rod was raised as a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]].

And that's it, when somebody says to me 'I'll never forget', that's worth more to me than five Academy Awards, I'm in that person's life\".<ref name=\"MAB\"/>\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n|align     = left\n|direction = vertical\n|footer            = [[Robert De Niro]] (''bottom'') modeled his performance in ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987) on Steiger's (''top'') portrayal of Al Capone.\n|width     = 200\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n|image1    =Rod_Steiger_Al_Capone_1.jpg\n|width1    =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n|image2    = RobertdeNiro26.JPG\n|width2    =\n}}\nFilm writer Paul Simpson notes how closely Steiger prepared for his roles, and how he \"effortlessly\" recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a \"compelling take on an enigmatic figure\".{{sfn|Simpson|2011|p=92}} Judith Crist of ''New York Magazine'', reviewing ''Duck, You Sucker!'', commented that Steiger was \"totally without mannerisms, always with manner\", and noted that his \"silences are stunningly effective\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Grounds For Complaint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53|date=July 3, 1972|work=New York|page=53|first=Judith|last=Crist|issn=0028-7369}}</ref> Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, \"When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don't know how he does it. It's almost as if he gets inside the skin of the guy he's playing and starts being that person for a while\".{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|p=48}} Steiger said: \"I always tried to do things different. If I got a role which was similar to another I'd try to do it a little different.\"<ref name=\"MAB\"/> His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including [[Robert De Niro]], who used Steiger's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987).<ref name=\"NYT bio\"/> [[Elvis Presley]] was highly impressed with Steiger's \"powerful and wrenching performance\" in ''The Pawnbroker''.{{sfn|Schilling|Crisafulli|2006|p=99}}\n\nDespite Steiger's acclaim as an actor, he was frequently accused of overacting and won his fair share of critics, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. His acting was so dynamic at times that critics found him excessive and overbearing,<ref name=\"Ebert79\"/><ref name=Christiansen/> and even uncomfortable or laughable to watch.<ref name=\"James\"/><ref name=\"Schwartz Neighbor\"/> Steiger once clashed with Armenian director [[Rouben Mamoulian]], during a theatrical production of ''Oklahoma!'', as he was intolerant of Steiger's \"unusual acting technique\". Steiger ignored the director's concerns that he was mumbling his lines, and when he began chomping loudly on an apple during a scene with Gordon MacRae, Mamoulian exclaimed: \"Get out of my theater. Get out of my life!\", and fired him.{{sfn|Jones|2014|p=54}} Even Kazan found several of the Actors Studio's techniques disagreeable, preferring \"more humor and verve and less self-indulgence, self-pity and self-awareness\".{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|p=49}} Kazan felt that Steiger often displayed a competitive edge as an actor and tried to steal scenes from his co-stars. Steiger rejected these claims, insisting that he was merely \"trying to take the medium of acting to as far as I can go, and that why I sometimes go over the edge\".{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|p=85}}\n\nSeveral co-stars found working with Steiger difficult; [[Warren Oates]], according to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as \"somebody who had a tendency to go over the top\" during the making of ''In The Heat of the Night''.{{sfn|Compo|2009|p=146}} Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with \"Poitier's stillness and implied intensity\" and \"Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting\".{{sfn|Dyer|2013|p=99}} Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of ''The Harder They Fall'', referred to Steiger's method acting as the \"scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting\".{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|p=104}} Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: \"Usually I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him\".{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|p=83}} Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of ''Across the Bridge'', insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had \"never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance\" as Steiger.{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|pp=114\u201315}} Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|pp=67\u201368}}\n\n==Filmography and theatre credits==\n{{main|Rod Steiger on screen and stage}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|25em}}\n* {{cite book|last1=\u042d\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0441|first1=\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0439|last2=Thomas|first2=James|title=The Joy of Rehearsal: Reflections on Interpretation and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRtqTy1-Aw8C&pg=PA114|year= 2006|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0-8204-6338-4|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Allon|first1=Yoram|last2=Cullen|first2=Del|last3=Patterson|first3=Hannah|title=Contemporary North American Film Directors: A Wallflower Critical Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/contemporarynort00yora|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/contemporarynort00yora/page/276 276]|year=2002|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-903364-52-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Anastasia|first1=George|last2=Macnow|first2=Glen|title=The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies: Featuring the 100 Greatest Gangster Films of All Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kY5tHAksa7kC&pg=PT458|year=2011|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-7624-4370-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=I'm Not Dead...

(film)|Al Capone]]'' (1959)]]\n'''Rodney Stephen Steiger''' (April 14, 1925{{spaced ndash}}July 9, 2002) was an American actor, noted for his portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. Cited as \"one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars,\"{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|loc=Google Books Introduction}} he is closely associated with the art of [[method acting]], embodying the characters he played, which at times led to clashes with directors and co-stars. He starred as [[Marlon Brando]]'s mobster brother Charley in ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954), the title character Sol Nazerman in ''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]'' (1964), and as police chief Bill Gillespie opposite [[Sidney Poitier]] in the film ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' (1967) which won him the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\nSteiger was born in [[Westhampton, New York]], the son of a [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]]. He had a difficult childhood, with an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] mother from whom he ran away at the age of 16. After serving in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific Theater]] during World War II, he began his acting career with television roles in 1947, and went on to garner critical acclaim for his portrayal of the title character in the teleplay \"[[Marty (teleplay)|Marty]]\" (1953). He made his stage debut in 1946, in a production of ''Curse you, Jack Dalton!'' at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark, and subsequently appeared in productions such as  ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1950), [[Clifford Odets]]'s ''[[Night Music (play)|Night Music]]'' (1951), ''[[Seagulls Over Sorrento#Original Play|Seagulls Over Sorrento]]'' (1952) and ''[[Rashomon (play)|Rashomon]]'' (1959).\n\nSteiger made his film debut in [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s ''[[Teresa (1951 film)|Teresa]]'' in 1951, and subsequently appeared in films such as ''[[The Big Knife]]'' (1955), ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'' (1955), ''[[Across the Bridge (film)|Across the Bridge]]'' (1957) and ''[[Al Capone (film)|Al Capone]]'' (1959). After Steiger's performance in ''The Pawnbroker'' in 1964, in which he played an embittered Jewish [[Holocaust]] survivor working as a pawnbroker in New York City, he portrayed an opportunistic Russian politician in [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1965). ''In the Heat of the Night'' (1967) won five [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steiger, who was lauded for his performance as a Mississippi police chief who learns to respect an African-American officer (Poitier) as they search for a killer. The following year, he played a serial killer of many guises in ''[[No Way to Treat a Lady (film)|No Way to Treat a Lady]]''.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Steiger increasingly turned to European productions in his search for more demanding roles. He portrayed [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' (1970), a Mexican bandit in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), [[Benito Mussolini]] in ''[[Last Days of Mussolini]]'' (1975), and ended the decade playing a disturbed priest in '' [[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (1979). By the 1980s, heart problems and depression took its toll on Steiger's career, and he found it difficult to find employment, agreeing to appear in low-budget [[B movie]]s. One of his final roles was as judge [[H. Lee Sarokin]] in the prison drama ''[[The Hurricane (1999 film)|The Hurricane]]'' (1999), which reunited him with ''In the Heat of the Night'' director [[Norman Jewison]]. Steiger was married five times, and had a daughter, opera singer [[Anna Steiger]], and a son, Michael Steiger. He died of [[pneumonia]] and kidney failure as a result of complications from surgery for a [[gall bladder]] tumor on July 9, 2002, aged 77, in Los Angeles, and was survived by his fifth wife [[Joan Benedict Steiger]].\n\n==Early life and acting background==\n[[File:West Side High Newark jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Steiger attended [[West Side High School (New Jersey)|West Side High School]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], where he showed an early interest in acting.]]\nSteiger was born on April 14, 1925 in [[Westhampton, New York]], the only child of Lorraine ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Driver) and Frederick Steiger,{{sfn|Wise|Rehill|2007|p=241}}<ref name=\"CBSNews\">{{cite web|title=Actor Rod Steiger dies|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/actor-rod-steiger-dies/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=July 9, 2002|accessdate=April 24, 2016|author=Vries, Lloyd|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424012141/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/actor-rod-steiger-dies/|archivedate=April 24, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> of [[French people|French]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Germans|German]] descent.<ref name=\"Guardian Obituary\">{{cite web|author=French, Phillip|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jul/14/features.review2|title=Steiger brought a sense of pain, guilt and authenticity to his characters|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 14, 2002|accessdate=July 14, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928052031/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jul/14/features.review2|archivedate=September 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite web|date=July 19, 2002 |title=Rod Steiger |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/07/10/db1001.xml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109233805/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2002%2F07%2F10%2Fdb1001.xml |archivedate=November 9, 2007 |accessdate=July 23, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Rod was raised as a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]].

Steiger ignored the director's concerns that he was mumbling his lines, and when he began chomping loudly on an apple during a scene with Gordon MacRae, Mamoulian exclaimed: \"Get out of my theater. Get out of my life!\", and fired him.{{sfn|Jones|2014|p=54}} Even Kazan found several of the Actors Studio's techniques disagreeable, preferring \"more humor and verve and less self-indulgence, self-pity and self-awareness\".{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|p=49}} Kazan felt that Steiger often displayed a competitive edge as an actor and tried to steal scenes from his co-stars. Steiger rejected these claims, insisting that he was merely \"trying to take the medium of acting to as far as I can go, and that why I sometimes go over the edge\".{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|p=85}}\n\nSeveral co-stars found working with Steiger difficult; [[Warren Oates]], according to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as \"somebody who had a tendency to go over the top\" during the making of ''In The Heat of the Night''.{{sfn|Compo|2009|p=146}} Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with \"Poitier's stillness and implied intensity\" and \"Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting\".{{sfn|Dyer|2013|p=99}} Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of ''The Harder They Fall'', referred to Steiger's method acting as the \"scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting\".{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|p=104}} Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: \"Usually I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him\".{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|p=83}} Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of ''Across the Bridge'', insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had \"never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance\" as Steiger.{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|pp=114\u201315}} Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.{{sfn|Hutchinson|1998|pp=67\u201368}}\n\n==Filmography and theatre credits==\n{{main|Rod Steiger on screen and stage}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|25em}}\n* {{cite book|last1=\u042d\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0441|first1=\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0439|last2=Thomas|first2=James|title=The Joy of Rehearsal: Reflections on Interpretation and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRtqTy1-Aw8C&pg=PA114|year= 2006|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0-8204-6338-4|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Allon|first1=Yoram|last2=Cullen|first2=Del|last3=Patterson|first3=Hannah|title=Contemporary North American Film Directors: A Wallflower Critical Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/contemporarynort00yora|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/contemporarynort00yora/page/276 276]|year=2002|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-903364-52-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Anastasia|first1=George|last2=Macnow|first2=Glen|title=The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies: Featuring the 100 Greatest Gangster Films of All Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kY5tHAksa7kC&pg=PT458|year=2011|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-7624-4370-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=I'm Not Dead...

[[Camp X-Ray]] was established to segregate migrants who had committed crimes, such as theft, assault and battery, prostitution and black-market activities, from other migrants and from U.S. civilians and military personnel at Guantanamo. In 1996, Operation Sea Signal came to an end and the military abandoned Camp X-Ray.\n\nIn December 2001, after the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|United States intervention in Afghanistan]], Joint Task Force 160 was reactivated.

In January 2002, the first [[detainees]] were transferred to Guantanamo Bay and housed in Camp X-Ray. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) had its first visit to the facility six days later. The ICRC has continued quarterly visits up to 2010.\n\n==Detention facilities==\nIn April 2002, construction of the new 410-bed [[Camp Delta]] (Camps 1, 2, 3) was completed.

Unlike the vampires traditionally associated with [[Dracula]] or Caine, Kuei-jin were once mortals who died with the burden of unfulfilled [[Dharma]] or duties. Tortured in [[Yomi]] for their inadequacies in life, their [[soul]]s successfully escaped and returned to their bodies. Now half-alive and half-dead, Kuei-jin must live by stealing [[Qi|chi]] from mortal victims to sustain themselves while trying to fulfill their Dharma. The most convenient form of chi that can be stolen is in blood, leading to their vampiric tendencies, but they cannot create new vampires. Practically all Kindred distrust the Kuei-jin. The Kuei-jin are also known to war with the other sects for territory.\n\n==Themes==\nKuei-jin are beings torn by inner conflict, and the themes of the game relate to this heavily.  Unlike Western vampires, Kuei-jin are [[ghost|revenant]]s and thus spiritual beings in nature.\n\n===Yin vs. Yang===\nThe classic opposition of [[Yin Yang|yin and yang]] are important to Kuei-jin not only for philosophical reasons, but because this dichotomy also delineates the two forms of chi they can potentially ingest. An imbalance of yin or yang chi in their system can lead to dire consequences.  Yin-imbalanced Kuei-jin become corpselike [[zombie]]s suffering from a lack of [[emotion]]. At its worst, yin-imbalance reduces a kuei-jin to a [[hopping corpse]]. Yang-imbalanced Kuei-jin suffer wild mood swings and impulsive lusts for food, sex, and other forms of stimulation. Possibly the strangest consequence of yang-imbalance is the ability to have or sire children. Such children are called [[Dhampir (World of Darkness)|dhampyr]]s, and are mortal half-vampires.\n\n===Hun vs. P'o===\nA Kuei-jin's stint in the hells of [[Yomi]] divides the mind into two [[Hun and po]] parts: The Hun, or high mind, that is the seat of rational thought, and the P'o, or demon mind, that exists to satisfy its own base urges (usually at the expense of the Hun). As former [[Wraith: The Oblivion|wraiths]], a Kuei-jin has a splinter of the forces of Oblivion in its soul. While many Kuei-jin see their P'o as a curse, it is important to note that without the P'o, they would never have escaped hell in the first place. Furthermore, Kuei-jin who stifle and contain their P'o utterly become cold, calculating individuals who lack any ideological spark; such stagnancy can be devastating when the weight of karma (spiritual consequences of actions) is on one's shoulders.\n\n===Mortal vs. Spirit===\nThe Kuei-jin stand between the mortal world (which they can never fully return to) and the spirit world (which they cannot fully embrace). Many Kuei-jin struggle to find a balance between these two worlds that suits the precise nature of their Dharma.\n\n==Dharmas==\nA Kuei-jin's existence is a quest for enlightenment. In their search for karmic resolution, different Kuei-jin follow different paths to ease their karmic discomfort. The Dharmas, five philosophies accepted by the greater Kuei-jin community as potential paths, each emphasize a particular aspect of Kuei-jin existence:\n\n* '''The Howl of the Devil Tiger''': The Dharma embracing the P'o; these Kuei-Jin seek to metamorphose into demons (rather than to serve demons, as the hated Akuma do).\n* '''The Way of the Resplendent Crane''': The Dharma embracing the Hun; they seek to uphold the highest principles (in theory; they are nonetheless still monsters).\n* '''The Song of the Shadow''': The Dharma embracing Yin. Embrace their dead and passionless nature through the pursuit of knowledge and sorcerous power, seeking mastery over the forces of death.\n* '''The Path of a Thousand Whispers''': The Dharma embracing balance. Known also as \"Rootless Trees\", they adopt a series of different mortal identities in order to learn from a variety of experiences, while their true self remains detached and \"Zen\" about these lessons.\n* '''The Dance of the Thrashing Dragon''': The Dharma embracing Yang. Seek to defy their undead state through frenzied revelry and acts meant to celebrate life (in all its bloodcurdling savagery).\n\nIn addition to these primary dharmas, a number of Heretical Dharmas have also come into existence. Not accepted in Kuei-jin society, these paths nevertheless find some followers:\n\n* '''The Face of the Gods''': A Dharma embracing both Hun and P'o. As the name suggests, they intend to become literal gods on Earth, or at least claim the role and be worshipped.\n* '''The Flame of the Rising Phoenix''': A Dharma embracing both Hun and Yang, whose members seek to reclaim their original lives rather than to accept their new status as monsters.\n* '''The Spirit of the Living Earth''': A Dharma embracing both Yin and Yang. A shamanic path devoted to the Old Ways.\n* '''The Tempest of Inner Focus''': A Dharma embracing balance, in a more straightforward and moderate manner than the Thousand Whispers. Influenced by Taoism.\n* '''The Scorpion Eaters''': A Dharma embracing the P'o, who can consume only Tainted Chi and yet are not Akuma. \n\nFinally, some Kuei-jin turn their backs on enlightenment entirely, instead swearing fealty to the Yama Kings (the rulers of Yomi) to metamorphose into Akuma, the demon people. Bartering their souls, Akuma enter [[Faust]]ian deals with the Yama Kings and pursue only power.\n\n==The Middle Kingdom==\nKuei-jin are the most visible shen (supernatural creatures) of the Middle Kingdom (modern [[Asia]]), but are not alone. Unlike [[Vampire: The Masquerade|Western Kindred]], they have close ties with the spirit world. They must also compete with the hengeyokai ([[Changing Breed|Shapeshifters]] of the East), [[Mage: The Ascension|mages]], and [[Preta|gaki]].\n\nThere are several offshoots of the Kuei-Jin who share a measure of their condition but are different in certain particulars.\n\u00a7 Dhampyrs are the half-dead mortal children sired (or, more unusually, borne) by Kuei-Jin in the throes of Yang imbalance, which enables them to breed as if living. Capable of controlling Chi and manifesting Disciplines, the dhampyrs have many of the vampires' strengths and few of their weaknesses, both to a milder extent.\n\u00a7 Yulan-Jin are a subset of Kuei-Jin whose souls are not able to reform their original bodies after escaping from Hell; instead, they possess the bodies of the recently dead, and when \"killed\", they must find a new corpse to inhabit, forcing them to switch identities. Are generally scorned by the Kuei-Jin for their perceived spiritual weakness.\n\n==Books==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Title !! Product No. !!ISBN !! Release !!

This was done as the game could attract attention in the same way as a new standalone game, while not being the start of a new line that would require support.<ref name=\"designers\">{{cite book |last=Appelcline |first=Shannon |year=2014 |title=Designers & Dragons: The '90s |edition=2nd |publisher=Evil Hat Productions |pages=7\u201352 |isbn=978-1-613170-84-7}}</ref>\n\nThe game did however receive a series of supplements on its own, starting with the ''Kindred of the East Companion'' book in 1999, which updated the game to bring it in line with 1998's ''Revised Edition'' of ''Vampire: The Masquerade'', as well as further detailing Asian vampire society and adding new gameplay mechanics and background information.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Lhomme |first=Tristan |date=June\u2013July 1999 |title=Kindred of the East Companion |language=French |magazine=[[Casus Belli (magazine)|Casus Belli]] |issue=120 |page=84 |publisher=Excelsior Publications}}</ref> As part of ''[[Time of Judgment]]'' event, the ending to the ''World of Darkness'' series, White Wolf concluded the ''Kindred of the East'' metaplot with adventures published in the book ''World of Darkness: Time of Judgment''.<ref name=\"designers\"/>\n\n==Overview==\nCharacters in Kindred of the East (or Kuei-jin, as they call themselves) are [[vampire]]s as depicted in classical [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]], and [[India]]n [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Taoist]], [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhist]] [[mythology]]. Unlike the vampires traditionally associated with [[Dracula]] or Caine, Kuei-jin were once mortals who died with the burden of unfulfilled [[Dharma]] or duties. Tortured in [[Yomi]] for their inadequacies in life, their [[soul]]s successfully escaped and returned to their bodies. Now half-alive and half-dead, Kuei-jin must live by stealing [[Qi|chi]] from mortal victims to sustain themselves while trying to fulfill their Dharma. The most convenient form of chi that can be stolen is in blood, leading to their vampiric tendencies, but they cannot create new vampires. Practically all Kindred distrust the Kuei-jin. The Kuei-jin are also known to war with the other sects for territory.\n\n==Themes==\nKuei-jin are beings torn by inner conflict, and the themes of the game relate to this heavily.  Unlike Western vampires, Kuei-jin are [[ghost|revenant]]s and thus spiritual beings in nature.\n\n===Yin vs. Yang===\nThe classic opposition of [[Yin Yang|yin and yang]] are important to Kuei-jin not only for philosophical reasons, but because this dichotomy also delineates the two forms of chi they can potentially ingest. An imbalance of yin or yang chi in their system can lead to dire consequences.  Yin-imbalanced Kuei-jin become corpselike [[zombie]]s suffering from a lack of [[emotion]]. At its worst, yin-imbalance reduces a kuei-jin to a [[hopping corpse]]. Yang-imbalanced Kuei-jin suffer wild mood swings and impulsive lusts for food, sex, and other forms of stimulation. Possibly the strangest consequence of yang-imbalance is the ability to have or sire children. Such children are called [[Dhampir (World of Darkness)|dhampyr]]s, and are mortal half-vampires.\n\n===Hun vs. P'o===\nA Kuei-jin's stint in the hells of [[Yomi]] divides the mind into two [[Hun and po]] parts: The Hun, or high mind, that is the seat of rational thought, and the P'o, or demon mind, that exists to satisfy its own base urges (usually at the expense of the Hun). As former [[Wraith: The Oblivion|wraiths]], a Kuei-jin has a splinter of the forces of Oblivion in its soul. While many Kuei-jin see their P'o as a curse, it is important to note that without the P'o, they would never have escaped hell in the first place. Furthermore, Kuei-jin who stifle and contain their P'o utterly become cold, calculating individuals who lack any ideological spark; such stagnancy can be devastating when the weight of karma (spiritual consequences of actions) is on one's shoulders.\n\n===Mortal vs. Spirit===\nThe Kuei-jin stand between the mortal world (which they can never fully return to) and the spirit world (which they cannot fully embrace). Many Kuei-jin struggle to find a balance between these two worlds that suits the precise nature of their Dharma.\n\n==Dharmas==\nA Kuei-jin's existence is a quest for enlightenment. In their search for karmic resolution, different Kuei-jin follow different paths to ease their karmic discomfort. The Dharmas, five philosophies accepted by the greater Kuei-jin community as potential paths, each emphasize a particular aspect of Kuei-jin existence:\n\n* '''The Howl of the Devil Tiger''': The Dharma embracing the P'o; these Kuei-Jin seek to metamorphose into demons (rather than to serve demons, as the hated Akuma do).\n* '''The Way of the Resplendent Crane''': The Dharma embracing the Hun; they seek to uphold the highest principles (in theory; they are nonetheless still monsters).\n* '''The Song of the Shadow''': The Dharma embracing Yin. Embrace their dead and passionless nature through the pursuit of knowledge and sorcerous power, seeking mastery over the forces of death.\n* '''The Path of a Thousand Whispers''': The Dharma embracing balance. Known also as \"Rootless Trees\", they adopt a series of different mortal identities in order to learn from a variety of experiences, while their true self remains detached and \"Zen\" about these lessons.\n* '''The Dance of the Thrashing Dragon''': The Dharma embracing Yang. Seek to defy their undead state through frenzied revelry and acts meant to celebrate life (in all its bloodcurdling savagery).\n\nIn addition to these primary dharmas, a number of Heretical Dharmas have also come into existence. Not accepted in Kuei-jin society, these paths nevertheless find some followers:\n\n* '''The Face of the Gods''': A Dharma embracing both Hun and P'o. As the name suggests, they intend to become literal gods on Earth, or at least claim the role and be worshipped.\n* '''The Flame of the Rising Phoenix''': A Dharma embracing both Hun and Yang, whose members seek to reclaim their original lives rather than to accept their new status as monsters.\n* '''The Spirit of the Living Earth''': A Dharma embracing both Yin and Yang. A shamanic path devoted to the Old Ways.\n* '''The Tempest of Inner Focus''': A Dharma embracing balance, in a more straightforward and moderate manner than the Thousand Whispers. Influenced by Taoism.\n* '''The Scorpion Eaters''': A Dharma embracing the P'o, who can consume only Tainted Chi and yet are not Akuma. \n\nFinally, some Kuei-jin turn their backs on enlightenment entirely, instead swearing fealty to the Yama Kings (the rulers of Yomi) to metamorphose into Akuma, the demon people. Bartering their souls, Akuma enter [[Faust]]ian deals with the Yama Kings and pursue only power.\n\n==The Middle Kingdom==\nKuei-jin are the most visible shen (supernatural creatures) of the Middle Kingdom (modern [[Asia]]), but are not alone. Unlike [[Vampire: The Masquerade|Western Kindred]], they have close ties with the spirit world. They must also compete with the hengeyokai ([[Changing Breed|Shapeshifters]] of the East), [[Mage: The Ascension|mages]], and [[Preta|gaki]].\n\nThere are several offshoots of the Kuei-Jin who share a measure of their condition but are different in certain particulars.\n\u00a7 Dhampyrs are the half-dead mortal children sired (or, more unusually, borne) by Kuei-Jin in the throes of Yang imbalance, which enables them to breed as if living. Capable of controlling Chi and manifesting Disciplines, the dhampyrs have many of the vampires' strengths and few of their weaknesses, both to a milder extent.\n\u00a7 Yulan-Jin are a subset of Kuei-Jin whose souls are not able to reform their original bodies after escaping from Hell; instead, they possess the bodies of the recently dead, and when \"killed\", they must find a new corpse to inhabit, forcing them to switch identities. Are generally scorned by the Kuei-Jin for their perceived spiritual weakness.\n\n==Books==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Title !! Product No. !!ISBN !! Release !!

His name merely means \"The Late\", \"The Deceased\", and he is probably the same person as King '''Gapi Baguna II''', mentioned in several other chronicles and king lists.

Valentijn drew from now lost manuscripts and traditions from [[North Maluku]].<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 9-10.</ref> According to his account, Marhum was the son and successor of the seventeenth King Gapi Baguna II (r. 1432-1465). His island kingdom was one of the four realms that traditionally existed in North Maluku, the others being [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]], [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] and [[Jailolo]]. Jailolo, which was based on [[Halmahera]], was as yet the most powerful of the four, and waged war against Marhum during his time.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amstedam: Onder de Linden, p. 140-1.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/140/mode/2up]</ref> The reign of Marhum saw significant economic changes in the region. [[Malay people|Malay]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] traders arrived in increasing numbers to the islands in eastern [[Indonesia]] to purchase spices. The [[Banda Islands]] in southern Maluku became an important trading entrepot, and a few Ternatan ships went there with cargoes of [[cloves]] which grew abundantly on their island. This attracted the foreign merchants to proceed from Banda to Ternate to take in spices. At this time the clove trees were not purposefully planted, and the locals obtained the stalks by cutting down the branches rather than climbing the trees to pick the stalks, as was later the case.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amstedam: Onder de Linden, p. 140-1.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/140/mode/2up]</ref>\n\nAmong the visiting merchants was a Javanese Muslim called Hussein, or Dato Maulana Hussein, who was also a preacher. The Ternatans were as yet unacquainted with reading and writing, and were stunned when Hussein and his boys were able to read out words from the letters of the [[Qur'an]]. Hussein told the bystanders that these were holy letters that no-one may read without knowing God and his Prophet. In that way the first tenets of Islam entered North Malukan society. Marhum was also converted, though his knowledge of the creed was rather rudimentary. according to Valentijn, he was a simple figure and far from a strong ruler.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I. Amstedam: Onder de Linden, p. 140.[https://archive.org/details/oudennieuwoostin01vale/page/140/mode/2up]</ref> It was his son and successor Zainal Abidin who began to introduce certain Islamic institutions, at least among the elite of the kingdom, and to expand the political network of Ternate.\n\n==Identity==\n\nSeveral texts, such as Rijali's ''Hikayat Tanah Hitu'' (written before 1657 and later adjusted in c. 1700), ''Hikayat Ternate'', and Na\u00efdah's chronicle, state that Gapi Baguna II was the actual father of Sultan Zainal Abidin, although Valentijn makes him the father of Marhum. This Gapi Baguna is sometimes said to have followed his son Zainal Abidin on a journey to [[Java]] to learn more about Islam, but to have died on the return journey.<ref>Na\u00efdah (1878) \"Geschiedenis van Ternate\", ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'', 4:II, p. 440-1.</ref> It has therefore been assumed that one historical figure has been split into two.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 11.</ref> Whatever the case, European accounts from the 16th century say that Islam had been introduced in North Maluku in about the 1460s or 1470s, which provides some support for the conversion stories.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 32.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Spice trade]]\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Andaya, Leonard Y.

The Ternatans were as yet unacquainted with reading and writing, and were stunned when Hussein and his boys were able to read out words from the letters of the [[Qur'an]]. Hussein told the bystanders that these were holy letters that no-one may read without knowing God and his Prophet. In that way the first tenets of Islam entered North Malukan society. Marhum was also converted, though his knowledge of the creed was rather rudimentary. according to Valentijn, he was a simple figure and far from a strong ruler.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724) ''Oud en nieuw Oost-Indien'', Vol. I.

Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a [[Collective leadership in the Soviet Union|collective leadership]], he eventually consolidated power to become the country's ''de facto'' [[dictator]] by the 1930s. A [[communist]] ideologically committed to the [[Leninist]] interpretation of [[Marxism]], Stalin formalised these ideas as [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], while his own policies are known as [[Stalinism]].\n\n<!--Early life, revolutionary activity and rise to power-->\nBorn to a poor family in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), Stalin joined the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, ''[[Pravda]]'', and raised funds for [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Lenin's]] [[Bolshevik]] faction via robberies, kidnappings, and [[protection rackets]]. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] and created a [[one-party state]] under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Serving in the [[Russian Civil War]] before overseeing [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|the Soviet Union's establishment]] in 1922, Stalin [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|assumed leadership over the country]] following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's 1924 death]]. Under Stalin, \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" became a central tenet of the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party's dogma]]. Through the [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]], the country underwent [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|agricultural collectivisation]] and [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialisation]], creating a centralised [[command economy]]. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1932\u201333]]. To eradicate accused \"[[enemies of the working class]]\", Stalin instituted the \"[[Great Purge]]\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state.\n\n<!--Governance in the latter part of the 1930s through to his death-->\nStalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the [[Communist International]] and supported European [[anti-fascist]] movements during the 1930s, particularly in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1939, it signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], resulting in the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. Germany ended the pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet [[Red Army]] repelled the German incursion and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in 1945, ending [[World War II]] in Europe. The Soviets [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexed the Baltic states]] and helped establish [[Soviet sphere of influence|Soviet-aligned governments]] throughout [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[Chinese Civil War|China]], and [[Soviet Civil Administration|North Korea]]. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global [[superpower]]s. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed [[Eastern Bloc]] and U.S.-backed [[Western Bloc]] which became known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it [[Soviet atomic bomb project|developed a nuclear weapon]] in 1949. In these years, the country experienced [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|another major famine]] and an [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|anti-semitic]] campaign peaking in the [[doctors' plot]]. After [[Stalin's death]] in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced him]] and initiated the [[de-Stalinisation]] of [[Soviet society]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive [[Stalin's cult of personality|personality cult]] within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and [[socialism]]. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his [[totalitarian]] government has been widely condemned for overseeing [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|mass repressions]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]], hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|that killed millions]].\n<!--please do not remove, for ToC spacing-->\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Stalin}}\n\n===Childhood to young adulthood: 1878\u20131899===\nStalin was born in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=11}} then part of the [[Tiflis Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] and home to a mix of Georgian, Armenian, Russian, and Jewish communities.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=15}} He was born on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6 Dec}},{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=23}}{{efn|Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's exact date of birth, Ioseb Jughashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]: 6 December) 1878.

argued that while Stalin initially ruled as part of a Communist Party [[oligarchy]], in 1934 the Soviet government transformed from this oligarchy into a personal dictatorship,{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=124}} with Stalin only becoming \"absolute dictator\" between March and June 1937, when senior military and NKVD figures were

Lenin's ideas by deviating from them.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=5}} The socio-economic nature of Stalin's Soviet Union has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of [[state socialism]], [[state capitalism]], [[bureaucratic collectivism]], or a totally unique mode of production.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=265\u2013266}} Socialist writers like Volkogonov have acknowledged that Stalin's

Starting in about 1920 Stalin gave a birth date of {{OldStyleDate|21 December|1879|9}}, despite being born on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6}}</ref> \u2013 5 March 1953) was a [[Georgians|Georgian]] revolutionary and [[Soviet people|Soviet]] politician who led the [[Soviet Union]] from the mid\u20131920s until 1953 as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (1922\u20131952) and [[premier of the Soviet Union]] (1941\u20131953). Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a [[Collective leadership in the Soviet Union|collective leadership]], he eventually consolidated power to become the country's ''de facto'' [[dictator]] by the 1930s. A [[communist]] ideologically committed to the [[Leninist]] interpretation of [[Marxism]], Stalin formalised these ideas as [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], while his own policies are known as [[Stalinism]].\n\n<!--Early life, revolutionary activity and rise to power-->\nBorn to a poor family in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), Stalin joined the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, ''[[Pravda]]'', and raised funds for [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Lenin's]] [[Bolshevik]] faction via robberies, kidnappings, and [[protection rackets]]. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] and created a [[one-party state]] under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Serving in the [[Russian Civil War]] before overseeing [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|the Soviet Union's establishment]] in 1922, Stalin [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|assumed leadership over the country]] following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's 1924 death]]. Under Stalin, \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" became a central tenet of the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party's dogma]]. Through the [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]], the country underwent [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|agricultural collectivisation]] and [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialisation]], creating a centralised [[command economy]]. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1932\u201333]]. To eradicate accused \"[[enemies of the working class]]\", Stalin instituted the \"[[Great Purge]]\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state.\n\n<!--Governance in the latter part of the 1930s through to his death-->\nStalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the [[Communist International]] and supported European [[anti-fascist]] movements during the 1930s, particularly in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1939, it signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], resulting in the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. Germany ended the pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet [[Red Army]] repelled the German incursion and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in 1945, ending [[World War II]] in Europe. The Soviets [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexed the Baltic states]] and helped establish [[Soviet sphere of influence|Soviet-aligned governments]] throughout [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[Chinese Civil War|China]], and [[Soviet Civil Administration|North Korea]]. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global [[superpower]]s. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed [[Eastern Bloc]] and U.S.-backed [[Western Bloc]] which became known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it [[Soviet atomic bomb project|developed a nuclear weapon]] in 1949. In these years, the country experienced [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|another major famine]] and an [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|anti-semitic]] campaign peaking in the [[doctors' plot]]. After [[Stalin's death]] in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced him]] and initiated the [[de-Stalinisation]] of [[Soviet society]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive [[Stalin's cult of personality|personality cult]] within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and [[socialism]]. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his [[totalitarian]] government has been widely condemned for overseeing [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|mass repressions]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]], hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|that killed millions]].\n<!--please do not remove, for ToC spacing-->\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Stalin}}\n\n===Childhood to young adulthood: 1878\u20131899===\nStalin was born in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=11}} then part of the [[Tiflis Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] and home to a mix of Georgian, Armenian, Russian, and Jewish communities.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=15}} He was born on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6 Dec}},{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=23}}{{efn|Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's exact date of birth, Ioseb Jughashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]: 6 December) 1878.

argued that while Stalin initially ruled as part of a Communist Party [[oligarchy]], in 1934 the Soviet government transformed from this oligarchy into a personal dictatorship,{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=124}} with Stalin only becoming \"absolute dictator\" between March and June 1937, when senior military and NKVD figures were

Lenin's ideas by deviating from them.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=5}} The socio-economic nature of Stalin's Soviet Union has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of [[state socialism]], [[state capitalism]], [[bureaucratic collectivism]], or a totally unique mode of production.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=265\u2013266}} Socialist writers like Volkogonov have acknowledged that Stalin's
