She is named in honor of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the 26th [[President of the United States]]. She is the [[USS\u00a0Roosevelt|fourth ship named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt]], three bearing his full name and a fourth with just his [[SS Roosevelt (1905)|last name]]. Another three U.S. Navy ships have \"Roosevelt\" in their names in honor of members of the [[Roosevelt family]]. This carrier's radio [[call sign]] is \"Rough Rider\", the nickname of President Roosevelt's [[Rough Riders|volunteer cavalry unit]] during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. She was launched in 1984, and saw her first action during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n==Background==\nInitially, President [[Gerald Ford]] cancelled the order for CVN-71 in 1976 and substituted two [[Aircraft Carrier (Medium)|CVV-type medium-sized, conventional-powered carrier]]s that were expected to operate [[V/STOL]] aircraft. The existing T-CBL design formed the basis for the new CVV, serving as a replacement for the aging {{sclass-|Midway|aircraft carrier|0}} carriers, while capable of operating all existing conventional carrier aircraft. This capability to operate conventional aircraft proved important as the [[Rockwell XFV-12|hoped-for supersonic V/STOL fighters]] did not come to fruition at the time. In any case, construction of the proposed CVV medium-sized carrier never took place.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aircraft Carriers: An Illustrated Design History |last=Friedman |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Friedman |year=1983 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn=978-0-87021-739-5 |pages=323\u2013324; 329\u2013333 |url=http://www.usni.org/store/books/aircraft-carriers/us-aircraft-carriers |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022162107/http://www.usni.org/store/books/aircraft-carriers/us-aircraft-carriers |archive-date=22 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=NANcvvJUL79>{{cite web |title=CVV |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1979/jul79.pdf |work=Naval Aviations News |publisher=[[Naval History & Heritage Command]] |location=[[Washington Navy Yard]] |page=8 |format=PDF |date=July 1979 |accessdate=18 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816080321/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1979/jul79.pdf |archivedate=16 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAuthorization for CVN-71 was further delayed when President [[Jimmy Carter]] [[Veto#United States|vetoed]] the 1979 Fiscal Year Department of Defense authorization bill because of the inclusion of this ''Nimitz''-class nuclear supercarrier in the Navy's shipbuilding program.<ref name=NANcvvJUL79/><ref name=Polmar>{{cite book |title=Aircraft Carriers: A History of Carrier Aviation and Its Influence on World Events, Volume 2 |last=Polmar |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc. |location=[[Dulles, Virginia]] |isbn=978-1-57488-663-4 |page=364 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAXHkfMs5wC&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=carter+veto+cvn-71&source=bl&ots=qHXzOChxFM&sig=CgSoi5y2rU6niQRye_XGKOMdf-g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MjjoUaTvFIaa9QSWw4C4AQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=carter%20veto%20cvn-71&f=false |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331175731/https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAXHkfMs5wC&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=carter+veto+cvn-71&source=bl&ots=qHXzOChxFM&sig=CgSoi5y2rU6niQRye_XGKOMdf-g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MjjoUaTvFIaa9QSWw4C4AQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=carter%20veto%20cvn-71&f=false |archive-date=31 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a result of the [[Iran hostage crisis]] which required the increased deployment of U.S. aircraft [[carrier battle group]]s to the [[Indian Ocean]], President Carter reversed his stand on ''Nimitz''-class nuclear supercarriers, and CVN-71 was subsequently authorized under the 1980 Fiscal Year authorization bill for the U.S. Department of Defense.<ref name=Polmar/>\n\n==Design and construction==\n''Theodore Roosevelt'' was the first aircraft carrier to be assembled using modular construction, wherein large modules are independently constructed in \"lay-down\" areas, prior to being hoisted into place and welded together.

in the [[United States Navy]]. She is named in honor of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the 26th [[President of the United States]]. She is the [[USS\u00a0Roosevelt|fourth ship named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt]], three bearing his full name and a fourth with just his [[SS Roosevelt (1905)|last name]]. Another three U.S. Navy ships have \"Roosevelt\" in their names in honor of members of the [[Roosevelt family]]. This carrier's radio [[call sign]] is \"Rough Rider\", the nickname of President Roosevelt's [[Rough Riders|volunteer cavalry unit]] during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. She was launched in 1984, and saw her first action during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n==Background==\nInitially, President [[Gerald Ford]] cancelled the order for CVN-71 in 1976 and substituted two [[Aircraft Carrier (Medium)|CVV-type medium-sized, conventional-powered carrier]]s that were expected to operate [[V/STOL]] aircraft. The existing T-CBL design formed the basis for the new CVV, serving as a replacement for the aging {{sclass-|Midway|aircraft carrier|0}} carriers, while capable of operating all existing conventional carrier aircraft. This capability to operate conventional aircraft proved important as the [[Rockwell XFV-12|hoped-for supersonic V/STOL fighters]] did not come to fruition at the time. In any case, construction of the proposed CVV medium-sized carrier never took place.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aircraft Carriers: An Illustrated Design History |last=Friedman |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Friedman |year=1983 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn=978-0-87021-739-5 |pages=323\u2013324; 329\u2013333 |url=http://www.usni.org/store/books/aircraft-carriers/us-aircraft-carriers |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022162107/http://www.usni.org/store/books/aircraft-carriers/us-aircraft-carriers |archive-date=22 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=NANcvvJUL79>{{cite web |title=CVV |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1979/jul79.pdf |work=Naval Aviations News |publisher=[[Naval History & Heritage Command]] |location=[[Washington Navy Yard]] |page=8 |format=PDF |date=July 1979 |accessdate=18 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816080321/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1979/jul79.pdf |archivedate=16 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAuthorization for CVN-71 was further delayed when President [[Jimmy Carter]] [[Veto#United States|vetoed]] the 1979 Fiscal Year Department of Defense authorization bill because of the inclusion of this ''Nimitz''-class nuclear supercarrier in the Navy's shipbuilding program.<ref name=NANcvvJUL79/><ref name=Polmar>{{cite book |title=Aircraft Carriers: A History of Carrier Aviation and Its Influence on World Events, Volume 2 |last=Polmar |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc. |location=[[Dulles, Virginia]] |isbn=978-1-57488-663-4 |page=364 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAXHkfMs5wC&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=carter+veto+cvn-71&source=bl&ots=qHXzOChxFM&sig=CgSoi5y2rU6niQRye_XGKOMdf-g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MjjoUaTvFIaa9QSWw4C4AQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=carter%20veto%20cvn-71&f=false |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331175731/https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAXHkfMs5wC&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=carter+veto+cvn-71&source=bl&ots=qHXzOChxFM&sig=CgSoi5y2rU6niQRye_XGKOMdf-g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MjjoUaTvFIaa9QSWw4C4AQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=carter%20veto%20cvn-71&f=false |archive-date=31 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a result of the [[Iran hostage crisis]] which required the increased deployment of U.S. aircraft [[carrier battle group]]s to the [[Indian Ocean]], President Carter reversed his stand on ''Nimitz''-class nuclear supercarriers, and CVN-71 was subsequently authorized under the 1980 Fiscal Year authorization bill for the U.S. Department of Defense.<ref name=Polmar/>\n\n==Design and construction==\n''Theodore Roosevelt'' was the first aircraft carrier to be assembled using modular construction, wherein large modules are independently constructed in \"lay-down\" areas, prior to being hoisted into place and welded together.

However, species of ''Hindeodus'' were among the least abundant fossils (less than 0.25 specimens per kilogram of sample)<ref name=\":4\" />. They initially believed that ''Hindeodus'' may be a species of ''Trichondella'' or ''Elsonella'' but determined that ''Hindeodus'' is not morphologically and phylogenetically comparable to either and thus, must be a new genus<ref name=\":4\">C.B. Rexroad, W.M. Furnish.1964.Conodonts from the Pella Formation (Mississippian), South-Central Iowa. Journal of Paleontology (38)4: 667-676</ref>. \n\nWhile faunal diversity during the end [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event|Permian extinction]] event (251 million years ago) drastically plummeted, ''Hindeodus'' survived into the early [[Triassic]]<ref name=\":0\" />. A possible explanation for this is the versatility of certain ''Hindeodus'' species in terms of the environments they are able to survive in<ref name=\":0\" />. Additionally, there is evidence that ''Hindeodus'' was able to migrate during the Permian-Triassic transitional period which lead to its wide distribution worldwide during this time<ref name=\":0\" />.  \n\n== Description and paleobiology ==\n\n===''Hindeodus'' elements ===\n''Hindeodus'' was primarily soft-bodied, the only mineralized tissue of ''Hindeodus'' (and all other conodonts) are their \u201celements\u201d that are tooth like structures arranged in particular positions and are thought to have served as a feeding [[Conodont feeding apparatus|apparatus]] functioning to grasp and intake prey<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\nBecause conodont elements are essentially the only basis for conodont taxonomy, elements are extensively studied and debated. Therefore, there is specific categorization of elements based on their shape and position. The elements are divided into S, M and P elements. In ''Hindeodus'', S elements are ramiform (branch-like), M elements are makellate (pick-shaped) and P elements are pectiniform (cone-shaped). The ''H.parvus'' apparatus in particular consists of six kinds of elements arranged in 13 different positions. Nine S elements (unpair S0, paired S1, S2, S3, S4), two M elements, and one pair of P elements (P1). The S0 element is unpaired and has a long sharp cusp but lacks a posterior process. S1 and S2 elements are differentiated by being laterally compressed and having a long sharp cusp with two lateral processes. S3 and S4 elements have a long sharp cusp and an anterior process that is shorter than the posterior process. The M element is the typical makellate (pick-shaped) structure and the P1 element is pectiniform<ref name=\":7\">Zhang, M., Jiang, H., Purnell, M.A. and Lai, X. 2017. Testing hypotheses of element loss and instability in the apparatus composition of complex conodonts: articulated skeletons of ''Hindeodus''. Palaeontology(60): 595-608. </ref>.There are several different hypotheses for the functions of the ''Hindeodus'' apparatus. One hypothesis is that the elements were used as support structures for filamentous soft tissue used for suspension feeding. However, upon further analysis it was determined that the S, M and P elements would not provide enough surface area to support ciliated tissue needed for suspension feeding<ref name=\":6\">Goudemand, N.; Orchard, M.J.; Urdy, S.; Bucher, H.; Tafforeau, P. 2011. Synchrotron-aided reconstruction of the conodont feeding apparatus and implications for the mouth of the first vertebrates. PNAS (108)21: 8720\u20138724.</ref>. The more accepted hypothesis is that the conodont elements were used for predation. It is predicted that the S and M elements open allowing the prey to be captured in the oral cavity of the animal. The cusps of these elements aid in food intake by firmly gripping the prey while the blade-like P elements slice like a pair of scissors<ref name=\":6\" />. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of lingual cartilage found in conodonts that resembles those found in extant [[Cyclostome|cyclostomes]] ([[Hagfish]] and [[Lamprey]]) which are also predators<ref name=\":6\" />. \u00a0\n\nMorphology of conodont teeth varies widely, but the 15-element dentition of conodonts and their relative position is stable from the Ordovician to the Triassic. The typical 15-element apparatus consisted of 4P elements, 9S elements, and 2M elements. However, Triassic conodonts (such as ''Hindeodus parvus'') only had a 13-element apparatus (9S elements, 2M elements and 2P elements). It was previously believed that the 2 missing elements were due to failure to preserve S1 elements<ref>Agematsu, S., Sano, H. and Sashida, K. 2014. Natural assemblages of ''Hindeodus'' conodonts from a Permian\u2013Triassic boundary sequence, Japan. ''Palaeontology'', '''57''', 1277\u2013 1289.</ref>. This was not highly plausible because every other element was exceptionally preserved on the same bedding plane, so it was unlikely that apparatuses were preserved incompletely. An alternative hypothesis was that ''Hindeodus'' lost two S elements which implies changes in capture of prey (as the primary function of the S and M array is to trap prey in the animal\u2019s mouth).<ref>Huang, J. Y., Zhang, K. X., Zhang, Q. Y., Lu, T., Zhou, C. Y., Bai, J. K. and Hu, S. X. 2010. Discovery of Middle Triassic conodont clusters from Luoping Fauna, Yunnan Province.

Upon analysis of conodont history, it is evident that while P elements vary among conodonts, the S-M array is essentially conserved for over 250 million years. This suggests that evolutionary constraints on the number of S and M elements are stronger than those for the P elements, and thus are less likely to change<ref name=\":7\" />. The loss of P elements is likely linked to the Permian-Triassic extinction event during which many environmental changes occurred that may have impacted the availability of ''Hindeodus'' prey, resulting in a change of diet and a new food processing mechanism<ref name=\":7\" />.  \n[[File:Hindeodus_Apparatus_Hypotheses.jpg|alt=|thumb|Hypotheses of ''Hindeodus'' apparatus. (A) Hypothesis that apparatus is missing two P elements. (B) Hypothesis that apparatus is missing two S elements. (C) Hypothesis that all elements are present, two S elements fail to preserve. ]]\n\n=== Classification ===\n''Hindeodus'' is characterized by a P element with a large cusp, denticles that increase in width anteriorly (toward the head) except for the anterior-most denticle and generally decrease in height anteriorly, except for the posterior-most three denticles (the ones furthest back) which are at equal heights. Their cusps are much higher than denticles, and they possess S elements with a short lateral processes that are slightly upturned laterally with denticles of variable size<ref name=\":4\" />. ''Hindeodus'' is differentiated from other conodonts by having P elements with large fixed cusps located at the anterior end of the blade and usually grow primarily by adding new denticles only to the posterior end of the element<ref name=\":1\" />. Other conodonts vary in growth pattern and location of their cusps. For example, [[Ozarkodina|Ozarkidina]] have cusps located within the blade and growth can occur both anteriorly or posteriorly<ref name=\":1\" />. In ''Hindeodus'', the P element is crucial for identifying the genus, and had a stable morphology from the Carboniferous into the Triassic with only one minor morphological change<ref name=\":1\" />. However, in the late Permian and the early Triassic there was rapid evolutionary change especially in the P element. The cause of rapid change in morphology is not certain, but may be related to environmental changes leading to different availability of food source thus leading to changes in feeding mechanism.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSpecies of ''Hindeodus'' are divided into two groups based on the morphology of the posterior portion of the elements. Species such as ''H.parvus'' and ''H.eurypyge'' grow posteriorly and look rectangular from a lateral perspective.<ref name=\":1\" /> Elements grow by the addition of new denticles to the posterior margin<ref name=\":1\" />. After one denticle fully grows, a bulge begins to form on the lower posterior margin of the element, and gradually grows upward until the denticle fully develops<ref name=\":1\" />. The cycle repeats with a new bulge. These elements tend to grow evenly thus yielding a rectangular shape. In contrast, other species such as ''H.typicalis'' of ''H. latidentatus'' have a sloped lateral profile because the posterior section slopes downward<ref name=\":1\" />. New denticles form near the posterobasal corner and grow gradually upward but also to the side<ref name=\":1\" />. These elements tend to preferentially grow on the posterior portion of the element leading to a more sloped shape<ref name=\":1\" />. \n\n''Hindeodus'' is part of a large clade Prioniodontida (otherwise known as \"complex conodonts\") which has two major grades of conodonts, Prioniodinina and Ozarkodinina<ref name=\":5\" />. ''Hindeodus'' is part of Ozarkodinina in the family Anchignathodontidae<ref name=\":5\" />. The synapomorphies that define the clade Prioniodontida is the presence of a P elements with an inner lateral process and peg-like denticles<ref name=\":9\" />. The synapomorphies of Ozarkodinida are not as clear, but may be the presence of inner and outer lateral process on the S elements<ref name=\":9\" />.\n\nSpecies relationships within the genus ''Hindeodus'' are also complex, and there is lack of an established and accepted phylogenetic association between species of ''Hindeodus'', but certain relationships may be inferred<ref name=\":9\" />. ''H.parvus'' is likely derived from ''H.latidentatus'' based on the location of the fossils along with similarities among their elements<ref name=\":0\" />. ''H.parvus'' and its forerunner ''H.latidentatus'' are both easily identified by their P element of their apparatus and their S elements<ref name=\":0\" />. However, ''H.parvus'' is differentiated by the presence of cusps that are two times longer than the surrounding denticles<ref name=\":0\" />. There are also transition forms that have apparatus features of both ''H.parvus'' and ''H.latidentatus'' which provide evidence of ''H.parvus'' being derived from ''H.latidentatus''<ref name=\":0\" />. There is also evidence to suggest that most species of ''Hindeodus'' likely evolved from ''H.typicalis'' and an unnamed species ''H.n.sp.B'' that were alive in the early [[Changhsingian|Changsingian]]<ref name=\":9\">P.C.J Donoghue, M.A.Purnell, R.J.

The Conodonts ''Hindeodus'', ''[[Isarcicella]]'' and ''[[Sweetohindeodus]]'' in the Uppemost Permian and Lowermost Triassic. Geologia Croatia (49)1: 81-115</ref> For example, in the [[Meishan, Chiayi|Meishan]], Gondelellids were dominant in deep warm-water environments before the ecological stress that occurred in the Late Permian (which was possibly short-lasting cooling in low latitudes due to presence of aerosoles). Gondelellids and many other Permian species in the area disappeared, but ecologically tolerant ''Hindeodus'' survived and dominated the area. A similar situation occurred in Iran where Gondelellids were abruptly replaced by the ''Hindeodus'' in the deep-water areas.<ref name=\":3\" /> There is evidence that ''Hindeodus'' was able to migrate during the Permian Triassic transitional period which lead to its wide distribution worldwide during this time. They were able to survive and evolve in warm-water or cold water and shallow water or deep-water environments despite widespread anoxia during the Permian-Triassic transitional period<ref name=\":2\" />. This is one of the reasons ''Hindeodus'' is an ideal index fossil for the defining the Permian-Triassic boundary.\n\nHowever, not all species of ''Hindeodus'' were able to survive and thrive in a variety of different environments. Species such as ''H. julfenis, H.changxingensis, H.altudaensis'' among others are ecologically restricted to deeper, but warm water environments<ref name=\":3\" />. They are never found in shallow water facies, or in deep water that was presumably home to cold water fauna. In contrast, more common species such as ''H. typicalis'', and ''H. parvus'' were more ecologically tolerant and could live in environments not tolerated by other conodonts.<ref name=\":3\" /> ''H.parvus'' in particular is exceptionally versatile in regards to what environments it inhabited. ''H. parvus'' was found in both shallow water deposits as well as [[Pelagic sediment|pelagic]] deposits. It is found in [[Japan]], [[North America]], the Boreal realm ([[Greenland]]), and the entire [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{efn|The Tethys are a former tropical body of salt-water that separated the supercontinents of Laurasia in the north from Gondwana in the south during the Mesozoic Era (261-65MYA).

Gonwana was present day South America, Africa, India, Australia, Antarctica and Eurasian regions south of the Alpine Himalayan chain.}}\n\nAlthough ''Hindeodus'' is globally widespread, the Meishan section in Changxing County, Zejiang Province, South China is one of the more notable locations ''Hindeodus'' fossils were located. The Meishan section is used as the GSSP (global boundary stratotype section and point) for the Permian-Triassic boundary defined by the first appearance of ''H.parvus''<ref name=\":0\" />. It is a continuous, pelagic sedimentary record across the Permian-Triassic boundary without any stratigraphic gaps, and is essentially thermally unaltered (CAI=1-1.5).<ref name=\":0\" />The section consists of 7 quarries at the southern slope of the Meishan hill, 70 to 400m away from each other<ref name=\":0\" />. The beds of these quarries are nearly identical as they have the same thickness, facies, and fossil content<ref name=\":0\" />. Quarry D is best studied because it exposes the entire Changxing Limestone whereas the other quarries only expose the middle and upper part of the Changxing Limestone<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n== Biostratigraphic significance ==\nThe species ''Hindeodus parvus'' is an [[index fossil]] whose first appearance in the fossil beds at Meishan, [[Changxing County]], [[Zhejiang]] marks the base of the [[Triassic]], and thus the boundary between the Triassic and [[Permian]]<ref name=\":0\" />. 96% of the fauna in the late Permian disappeared at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Most of the groups that disappeared, re-appeared in the late Olekian (Middle Triassic)<ref>(Benton, M. J. & Twitchett, R. J. How to kill (almost) all life: the end-Permian extinction event. ''Trends Ecol. Evol.'' '''18''', 358\u2013365 (2003)</ref>. It is hypothesized that the extinction was caused by dense aerosols from strong volcanic activity in areas such as the Siberian Trap. These dense aerosols then caused short-lived rapid cooling in low latitudes, similar to a nuclear winter. Wide-spread anoxic conditions in the lower Triassic prevented the fauna from recovering. \u00a0Despite the rapid decrease in fauna, the exact Permian/Triassic boundary was still undetermined.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was initially defined by the first appearance of ammonoid (cephalopod) ''[[Otoceras]].'' Then, the base of the Triassic was defined by the appearance of ''Isarcicella isarcica''. The location of ''Isarcicella isarcica'' is nearly identical to the base of ''H.parvus'', but there are several advantages to using ''H. parvus'' to define the biostratigraphic Permian-Triassic boundary<ref name=\":0\" />.  Firstly, ''Hindeodus'' is the first globally distributed species that appears immediately after (5cm above) the minimum in fossil diversity indicated by the minimum in Carbon 13 at the Meishan section<ref name=\":0\" />. ''Hindeodus'' is also not environmentally restricted and can be found in both shallow water deposits and deep-water deposits. It is also thermally tolerant and is found in cool-water environments, mild environments as well as tropical warm-water<ref name=\":0\" />. Additionally, the derivation of ''H.Parvus'' from its forerunner ''H.latidentatus'' is clear because they are found sandwiched between transition forms. Despite the close proximity with similar fossils, ''Hindeodus'' is easily determinable and readily separable by its large cusp<ref name=\":0\" />. The wide distribution, clear derivation, and easy identifiability of ''Hindeodus'' makes it the ideal index fossil, which is why the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS) has assigned the [[First Appearance Datum]] of ''Hindeodus parvus'' as the [[List of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points#List|defining biological marker]] for the start of the [[Induan]], 252.2 \u00b1 0.5 million years ago, the first stage of the [[Triassic]].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Conodonts}}\n\n[[Category:Index fossils]]\n[[Category:Ozarkodinida genera]]\n[[Category:Triassic animals of Asia]]\n[[Category:Permian animals of Asia]]\n[[Category:Fossils of India]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Japan]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Oman]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Thailand]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Triassic animals of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Austria]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Italy]]\n[[Category:Permian animals of North America]]\n[[Category:Carboniferous animals of North America]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Fossils of New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1964]]\n\n[[Category:Permian conodonts]]\n[[Category:Triassic conodonts]]\n[[Category:Conodont genera]]\n[[Category:Conodont taxonomy]]\n[[Category:Extinction events]]\n[[Category:Fossils of China]]\n[[Category:Conodont families]]\n[[Category:Prioniodontida]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Serbia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Species of fish (fossil)}}\n{{Italic title}}\n{{Automatic taxobox\n| fossil_range = [[Early Carboniferous]]-[[Early Triassic]]<br>{{fossil range|345.3|251.3}}\n| image = Conodont Hindeodus Reconstruction.jpg\n| image_width = 250px\n| image_caption = ''Hindeodus'' reconstruction including apparatus\n| taxon = Hindeodus\n| authority = [[Carl B.

Rexroad, W.M. Furnish.1964.Conodonts from the Pella Formation (Mississippian), South-Central Iowa. Journal of Paleontology (38)4: 667-676</ref>. \n\nWhile faunal diversity during the end [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event|Permian extinction]] event (251 million years ago) drastically plummeted, ''Hindeodus'' survived into the early [[Triassic]]<ref name=\":0\" />. A possible explanation for this is the versatility of certain ''Hindeodus'' species in terms of the environments they are able to survive in<ref name=\":0\" />. Additionally, there is evidence that ''Hindeodus'' was able to migrate during the Permian-Triassic transitional period which lead to its wide distribution worldwide during this time<ref name=\":0\" />.  \n\n== Description and paleobiology ==\n\n===''Hindeodus'' elements ===\n''Hindeodus'' was primarily soft-bodied, the only mineralized tissue of ''Hindeodus'' (and all other conodonts) are their \u201celements\u201d that are tooth like structures arranged in particular positions and are thought to have served as a feeding [[Conodont feeding apparatus|apparatus]] functioning to grasp and intake prey<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\nBecause conodont elements are essentially the only basis for conodont taxonomy, elements are extensively studied and debated. Therefore, there is specific categorization of elements based on their shape and position. The elements are divided into S, M and P elements. In ''Hindeodus'', S elements are ramiform (branch-like), M elements are makellate (pick-shaped) and P elements are pectiniform (cone-shaped). The ''H.parvus'' apparatus in particular consists of six kinds of elements arranged in 13 different positions. Nine S elements (unpair S0, paired S1, S2, S3, S4), two M elements, and one pair of P elements (P1). The S0 element is unpaired and has a long sharp cusp but lacks a posterior process. S1 and S2 elements are differentiated by being laterally compressed and having a long sharp cusp with two lateral processes. S3 and S4 elements have a long sharp cusp and an anterior process that is shorter than the posterior process. The M element is the typical makellate (pick-shaped) structure and the P1 element is pectiniform<ref name=\":7\">Zhang, M., Jiang, H., Purnell, M.A. and Lai, X. 2017. Testing hypotheses of element loss and instability in the apparatus composition of complex conodonts: articulated skeletons of ''Hindeodus''. Palaeontology(60): 595-608. </ref>.There are several different hypotheses for the functions of the ''Hindeodus'' apparatus. One hypothesis is that the elements were used as support structures for filamentous soft tissue used for suspension feeding. However, upon further analysis it was determined that the S, M and P elements would not provide enough surface area to support ciliated tissue needed for suspension feeding<ref name=\":6\">Goudemand, N.; Orchard, M.J.; Urdy, S.; Bucher, H.; Tafforeau, P. 2011. Synchrotron-aided reconstruction of the conodont feeding apparatus and implications for the mouth of the first vertebrates. PNAS (108)21: 8720\u20138724.</ref>. The more accepted hypothesis is that the conodont elements were used for predation. It is predicted that the S and M elements open allowing the prey to be captured in the oral cavity of the animal. The cusps of these elements aid in food intake by firmly gripping the prey while the blade-like P elements slice like a pair of scissors<ref name=\":6\" />. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of lingual cartilage found in conodonts that resembles those found in extant [[Cyclostome|cyclostomes]] ([[Hagfish]] and [[Lamprey]]) which are also predators<ref name=\":6\" />. \u00a0\n\nMorphology of conodont teeth varies widely, but the 15-element dentition of conodonts and their relative position is stable from the Ordovician to the Triassic. The typical 15-element apparatus consisted of 4P elements, 9S elements, and 2M elements. However, Triassic conodonts (such as ''Hindeodus parvus'') only had a 13-element apparatus (9S elements, 2M elements and 2P elements). It was previously believed that the 2 missing elements were due to failure to preserve S1 elements<ref>Agematsu, S., Sano, H. and Sashida, K. 2014. Natural assemblages of ''Hindeodus'' conodonts from a Permian\u2013Triassic boundary sequence, Japan. ''Palaeontology'', '''57''', 1277\u2013 1289.</ref>. This was not highly plausible because every other element was exceptionally preserved on the same bedding plane, so it was unlikely that apparatuses were preserved incompletely. An alternative hypothesis was that ''Hindeodus'' lost two S elements which implies changes in capture of prey (as the primary function of the S and M array is to trap prey in the animal\u2019s mouth).<ref>Huang, J. Y., Zhang, K. X., Zhang, Q. Y., Lu, T., Zhou, C. Y., Bai, J. K. and Hu, S. X. 2010. Discovery of Middle Triassic conodont clusters from Luoping Fauna, Yunnan Province. ''Earth Science\u2014Journal of China University of Geosciences'', 35, 512\u2013 514.</ref> A final hypothesis is that ''Hindeodus'' lost two P elements which implies changes in food processing ability, which may be due to a change of diet to food that requires less slicing or crushing to ingest<ref name=\":7\" />. Upon analysis of conodont history, it is evident that while P elements vary among conodonts, the S-M array is essentially conserved for over 250 million years. This suggests that evolutionary constraints on the number of S and M elements are stronger than those for the P elements, and thus are less likely to change<ref name=\":7\" />. The loss of P elements is likely linked to the Permian-Triassic extinction event during which many environmental changes occurred that may have impacted the availability of ''Hindeodus'' prey, resulting in a change of diet and a new food processing mechanism<ref name=\":7\" />.  \n[[File:Hindeodus_Apparatus_Hypotheses.jpg|alt=|thumb|Hypotheses of ''Hindeodus'' apparatus. (A) Hypothesis that apparatus is missing two P elements. (B) Hypothesis that apparatus is missing two S elements. (C) Hypothesis that all elements are present, two S elements fail to preserve. ]]\n\n=== Classification ===\n''Hindeodus'' is characterized by a P element with a large cusp, denticles that increase in width anteriorly (toward the head) except for the anterior-most denticle and generally decrease in height anteriorly, except for the posterior-most three denticles (the ones furthest back) which are at equal heights. Their cusps are much higher than denticles, and they possess S elements with a short lateral processes that are slightly upturned laterally with denticles of variable size<ref name=\":4\" />. ''Hindeodus'' is differentiated from other conodonts by having P elements with large fixed cusps located at the anterior end of the blade and usually grow primarily by adding new denticles only to the posterior end of the element<ref name=\":1\" />. Other conodonts vary in growth pattern and location of their cusps. For example, [[Ozarkodina|Ozarkidina]] have cusps located within the blade and growth can occur both anteriorly or posteriorly<ref name=\":1\" />. In ''Hindeodus'', the P element is crucial for identifying the genus, and had a stable morphology from the Carboniferous into the Triassic with only one minor morphological change<ref name=\":1\" />. However, in the late Permian and the early Triassic there was rapid evolutionary change especially in the P element. The cause of rapid change in morphology is not certain, but may be related to environmental changes leading to different availability of food source thus leading to changes in feeding mechanism.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSpecies of ''Hindeodus'' are divided into two groups based on the morphology of the posterior portion of the elements. Species such as ''H.parvus'' and ''H.eurypyge'' grow posteriorly and look rectangular from a lateral perspective.<ref name=\":1\" /> Elements grow by the addition of new denticles to the posterior margin<ref name=\":1\" />. After one denticle fully grows, a bulge begins to form on the lower posterior margin of the element, and gradually grows upward until the denticle fully develops<ref name=\":1\" />. The cycle repeats with a new bulge. These elements tend to grow evenly thus yielding a rectangular shape. In contrast, other species such as ''H.typicalis'' of ''H. latidentatus'' have a sloped lateral profile because the posterior section slopes downward<ref name=\":1\" />. New denticles form near the posterobasal corner and grow gradually upward but also to the side<ref name=\":1\" />. These elements tend to preferentially grow on the posterior portion of the element leading to a more sloped shape<ref name=\":1\" />. \n\n''Hindeodus'' is part of a large clade Prioniodontida (otherwise known as \"complex conodonts\") which has two major grades of conodonts, Prioniodinina and Ozarkodinina<ref name=\":5\" />. ''Hindeodus'' is part of Ozarkodinina in the family Anchignathodontidae<ref name=\":5\" />. The synapomorphies that define the clade Prioniodontida is the presence of a P elements with an inner lateral process and peg-like denticles<ref name=\":9\" />. The synapomorphies of Ozarkodinida are not as clear, but may be the presence of inner and outer lateral process on the S elements<ref name=\":9\" />.\n\nSpecies relationships within the genus ''Hindeodus'' are also complex, and there is lack of an established and accepted phylogenetic association between species of ''Hindeodus'', but certain relationships may be inferred<ref name=\":9\" />. ''H.parvus'' is likely derived from ''H.latidentatus'' based on the location of the fossils along with similarities among their elements<ref name=\":0\" />. ''H.parvus'' and its forerunner ''H.latidentatus'' are both easily identified by their P element of their apparatus and their S elements<ref name=\":0\" />. However, ''H.parvus'' is differentiated by the presence of cusps that are two times longer than the surrounding denticles<ref name=\":0\" />. There are also transition forms that have apparatus features of both ''H.parvus'' and ''H.latidentatus'' which provide evidence of ''H.parvus'' being derived from ''H.latidentatus''<ref name=\":0\" />. There is also evidence to suggest that most species of ''Hindeodus'' likely evolved from ''H.typicalis'' and an unnamed species ''H.n.sp.B'' that were alive in the early [[Changhsingian|Changsingian]]<ref name=\":9\">P.C.J Donoghue, M.A.Purnell, R.J.

Paleogeography, Paleoclimatology, Paleoecology. 171: 63-72</ref> Clark (1974) proposed that ''Hindeodus'' was most abundant in nutrient-deficient deep waters of normal salinity, but some may have been in shallow water as well.<ref>D.L.

Conodont paleoecology of the Permian Phosphoria Formation and related rocks of Wyoming and adjacent area. Geological Society of America Special Paper (196): 263-281</ref> Orchard (1996) considered Hindeodus to be dominant in shallow, near shore and warm regions.<ref>M.J. Orchard. Conodont fauna from the Permian-Triassic boundary:Observations and Reservations. Permophiles (28): 29-35</ref> The general consensus now is that ''Hindeodus'' lived in wide range of marine depositional environments: nearshore, shallower, and warmer environments as well as deep-water environments, and offshore environments.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n[[Heinz Kozur|Kozur]] (1996) pointed out that the presence of ''Hindeodus'' in a certain area seems to not be controlled by the depth of the water or distance to the shore, but more dependent on the presence of competitor species (such as Gondelellids) that are better adapted to survive in that environment.<ref name=\":3\">Kozur, H.W. 1996. The Conodonts ''Hindeodus'', ''[[Isarcicella]]'' and ''[[Sweetohindeodus]]'' in the Uppemost Permian and Lowermost Triassic. Geologia Croatia (49)1: 81-115</ref> For example, in the [[Meishan, Chiayi|Meishan]], Gondelellids were dominant in deep warm-water environments before the ecological stress that occurred in the Late Permian (which was possibly short-lasting cooling in low latitudes due to presence of aerosoles). Gondelellids and many other Permian species in the area disappeared, but ecologically tolerant ''Hindeodus'' survived and dominated the area. A similar situation occurred in Iran where Gondelellids were abruptly replaced by the ''Hindeodus'' in the deep-water areas.<ref name=\":3\" /> There is evidence that ''Hindeodus'' was able to migrate during the Permian Triassic transitional period which lead to its wide distribution worldwide during this time. They were able to survive and evolve in warm-water or cold water and shallow water or deep-water environments despite widespread anoxia during the Permian-Triassic transitional period<ref name=\":2\" />. This is one of the reasons ''Hindeodus'' is an ideal index fossil for the defining the Permian-Triassic boundary.\n\nHowever, not all species of ''Hindeodus'' were able to survive and thrive in a variety of different environments. Species such as ''H. julfenis, H.changxingensis, H.altudaensis'' among others are ecologically restricted to deeper, but warm water environments<ref name=\":3\" />. They are never found in shallow water facies, or in deep water that was presumably home to cold water fauna. In contrast, more common species such as ''H. typicalis'', and ''H. parvus'' were more ecologically tolerant and could live in environments not tolerated by other conodonts.<ref name=\":3\" /> ''H.parvus'' in particular is exceptionally versatile in regards to what environments it inhabited. ''H. parvus'' was found in both shallow water deposits as well as [[Pelagic sediment|pelagic]] deposits. It is found in [[Japan]], [[North America]], the Boreal realm ([[Greenland]]), and the entire [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{efn|The Tethys are a former tropical body of salt-water that separated the supercontinents of Laurasia in the north from Gondwana in the south during the Mesozoic Era (261-65MYA). Laurasia is what is now North America, and the portion of Eurasia north of the Alpine Himalayan mountain ranges. Gonwana was present day South America, Africa, India, Australia, Antarctica and Eurasian regions south of the Alpine Himalayan chain.}}\n\nAlthough ''Hindeodus'' is globally widespread, the Meishan section in Changxing County, Zejiang Province, South China is one of the more notable locations ''Hindeodus'' fossils were located. The Meishan section is used as the GSSP (global boundary stratotype section and point) for the Permian-Triassic boundary defined by the first appearance of ''H.parvus''<ref name=\":0\" />. It is a continuous, pelagic sedimentary record across the Permian-Triassic boundary without any stratigraphic gaps, and is essentially thermally unaltered (CAI=1-1.5).<ref name=\":0\" />The section consists of 7 quarries at the southern slope of the Meishan hill, 70 to 400m away from each other<ref name=\":0\" />. The beds of these quarries are nearly identical as they have the same thickness, facies, and fossil content<ref name=\":0\" />. Quarry D is best studied because it exposes the entire Changxing Limestone whereas the other quarries only expose the middle and upper part of the Changxing Limestone<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n== Biostratigraphic significance ==\nThe species ''Hindeodus parvus'' is an [[index fossil]] whose first appearance in the fossil beds at Meishan, [[Changxing County]], [[Zhejiang]] marks the base of the [[Triassic]], and thus the boundary between the Triassic and [[Permian]]<ref name=\":0\" />. 96% of the fauna in the late Permian disappeared at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Most of the groups that disappeared, re-appeared in the late Olekian (Middle Triassic)<ref>(Benton, M. J. & Twitchett, R. J. How to kill (almost) all life: the end-Permian extinction event. ''Trends Ecol. Evol.'' '''18''', 358\u2013365 (2003)</ref>. It is hypothesized that the extinction was caused by dense aerosols from strong volcanic activity in areas such as the Siberian Trap. These dense aerosols then caused short-lived rapid cooling in low latitudes, similar to a nuclear winter. Wide-spread anoxic conditions in the lower Triassic prevented the fauna from recovering. \u00a0Despite the rapid decrease in fauna, the exact Permian/Triassic boundary was still undetermined.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was initially defined by the first appearance of ammonoid (cephalopod) ''[[Otoceras]].'' Then, the base of the Triassic was defined by the appearance of ''Isarcicella isarcica''. The location of ''Isarcicella isarcica'' is nearly identical to the base of ''H.parvus'', but there are several advantages to using ''H. parvus'' to define the biostratigraphic Permian-Triassic boundary<ref name=\":0\" />.  Firstly, ''Hindeodus'' is the first globally distributed species that appears immediately after (5cm above) the minimum in fossil diversity indicated by the minimum in Carbon 13 at the Meishan section<ref name=\":0\" />. ''Hindeodus'' is also not environmentally restricted and can be found in both shallow water deposits and deep-water deposits. It is also thermally tolerant and is found in cool-water environments, mild environments as well as tropical warm-water<ref name=\":0\" />. Additionally, the derivation of ''H.Parvus'' from its forerunner ''H.latidentatus'' is clear because they are found sandwiched between transition forms. Despite the close proximity with similar fossils, ''Hindeodus'' is easily determinable and readily separable by its large cusp<ref name=\":0\" />. The wide distribution, clear derivation, and easy identifiability of ''Hindeodus'' makes it the ideal index fossil, which is why the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS) has assigned the [[First Appearance Datum]] of ''Hindeodus parvus'' as the [[List of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points#List|defining biological marker]] for the start of the [[Induan]], 252.2 \u00b1 0.5 million years ago, the first stage of the [[Triassic]].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Conodonts}}\n\n[[Category:Index fossils]]\n[[Category:Ozarkodinida genera]]\n[[Category:Triassic animals of Asia]]\n[[Category:Permian animals of Asia]]\n[[Category:Fossils of India]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Japan]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Oman]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Thailand]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Triassic animals of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Austria]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Italy]]\n[[Category:Permian animals of North America]]\n[[Category:Carboniferous animals of North America]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Fossils of New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1964]]\n\n[[Category:Permian conodonts]]\n[[Category:Triassic conodonts]]\n[[Category:Conodont genera]]\n[[Category:Conodont taxonomy]]\n[[Category:Extinction events]]\n[[Category:Fossils of China]]\n[[Category:Conodont families]]\n[[Category:Prioniodontida]]\n[[Category:Fossils of Serbia]]\n", "name_user": "Tknifton", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePaleoenvironmental and geological information", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindeodus"}

The painting, measuring {{convert|304.5|x|509.2|cm|in}}, or roughly 10 by 17 feet, depicts the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia]] at the [[Royal Exhibition Building]] in Melbourne on 9 May 1901.\n\nThe painting is part of the [[Royal Collection]] but has been on permanent loan to the [[Parliament of Australia]] since 1957.

While the new [[Constitution of Australia]] called for a new capital to be constructed, away from the major cities, until that time [[Melbourne]] would act as the seat of government of the new nation.

The painting was made in three [[flax]] panels to enable it to be folded for transportation.<ref name=\"Victoria\" /> He travelled to Sydney and many other places to make sketches of the attendees as well as working from photographs. He asked his subjects for \"measurements\" to ensure accuracy&mdash;age, height, weight, [[hat size]] and even place of birth.<ref name=\"Victoria\" /> In all, the picture included 269 separate portraits.<ref name=\"Victoria\" />  Rumours spread that Roberts was paid by some of these dignitaries to ensure they were placed in a more prominent location.<ref name=\"Victoria\" /> \n\nMost of the delegates at the ceremony wore black, still observing a period of mourning after the recent death of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. To balance this Roberts gave some emphasis to the choir, who were dressed in white. A shaft of light focused on the Duke reading the King's proclamation also provides some colour; this phenomenon was remarked upon by contemporary newspaper reports.<ref name=\"History\" /> Artistic licence was taken with the dais shown as much higher that it actually was and some other architectural features of the building either downplayed or ignored. Roberts also honoured the \"Father of Federation\", [[Henry Parkes]], who had died five years previous. He added a portrait of Parkes in the form of a painting above the dais, this painting was not there on the day.<ref name=\"Victoria\" />\n\nRoberts took the painting to London&mdash;where many of the attendees lived&mdash;to complete, using the South African Room of the [[Imperial Institute]] as his workspace.<ref name=\"History\" /> The painting was finished on 16 November 1903; in all, it took Roberts two and a half years to complete.<ref name=\"Victoria\" /> It was then taken to Paris where [[photogravure]] reproductions were made for sale to the public, with Roberts signing 500 of them. Roberts did not sign the actual painting.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\n==History==\nThe painting was first exhibited in the [[Royal Academy]] in [[London]] before being presented to King Edward VII by the Commonwealth Government in 1904. It was then moved to  [[St. James's Palace]] where it remained on display until 1957.<ref name=\"History\" /> That year, [[Robert Menzies]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] requested the permanent loan of the painting from  [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The Queen consented and the picture returned to Australia in 1958.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nThe picture was to be exhibited in the King's Hall of the then [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] with the other historic records of events as the opening of the first Parliament in Canberra in 1927 and the Royal opening of Parliament in 1954, however it was too big for the available space.<ref name=\"History\" /> The decision was made to store the painting at the [[Australian War Memorial]] after a tour of the various state galleries. In 1969, the painting was moved to the Parliament House basement where it remained until 1980.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nAs a result of its travels, the picture had deteriorated considerably and required major restoration work.<ref name=\"History\" />{{quote|The picture had long been unprotected from changes in temperature and humidity, it had been constantly rolled and unrolled and untacked from its stretcher frame. At one stage it was even folded in half for transport. All this seriously affected the canvas. It gradually sagged, undulated and malformed and was in danger of becoming completely dilapidated.|Katrina Rumley|quoted in Mackenzie.<ref name=\"History\" />}} The School of Materials Conservation at the [[University of Canberra|Canberra College of Advanced Education]] started restoration work in 1980. The work included infra-red and ultra-violet photography to determine the condition of the painting followed by removal of old varnish and grime, repairs to the tacking margin and restoration of some small areas of paint. The work was completed in time for it to be taken to the new [[High Court of Australia]] building for its official opening by the Queen in 1981.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nThe designers of the new [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] were mindful of the need to provide an appropriate space to display ''The Big Picture'' in the new building. The Joint Standing Committee responsible for the new building made the decision to place the painting in the Main Committee Room Foyer.  The architects worked to ensure that major design elements in the room such as the skylight and balustrade around the work allowed for the integration of the painting with the available space.<ref name=\"History\" /> Because the fragile state of the picture prevented it from being rolled, moving the painting from the High Court to Parliament House was a major logistical exercise. The move required removal of some windows at the High Court, the construction of a special carrying frame and scaffolding and a system of winches to support the picture in place.<ref name=\"History\" /> The painting remains in this specially designed location to this day.\n\nOn the occasion of the centenary of Federation in 2001, the [[Premier of Victoria]] [[Steve Bracks]] led a call for ownership of the painting to be formally transferred from the British Royal Collection to the [[Monarchy of Australia|Australian Crown]].

The painting was made in three [[flax]] panels to enable it to be folded for transportation.<ref name=\"Victoria\" /> He travelled to Sydney and many other places to make sketches of the attendees as well as working from photographs.

To balance this Roberts gave some emphasis to the choir, who were dressed in white. A shaft of light focused on the Duke reading the King's proclamation also provides some colour; this phenomenon was remarked upon by contemporary newspaper reports.<ref name=\"History\" /> Artistic licence was taken with the dais shown as much higher that it actually was and some other architectural features of the building either downplayed or ignored. Roberts also honoured the \"Father of Federation\", [[Henry Parkes]], who had died five years previous. He added a portrait of Parkes in the form of a painting above the dais, this painting was not there on the day.<ref name=\"Victoria\" />\n\nRoberts took the painting to London&mdash;where many of the attendees lived&mdash;to complete, using the South African Room of the [[Imperial Institute]] as his workspace.<ref name=\"History\" /> The painting was finished on 16 November 1903; in all, it took Roberts two and a half years to complete.<ref name=\"Victoria\" /> It was then taken to Paris where [[photogravure]] reproductions were made for sale to the public, with Roberts signing 500 of them. Roberts did not sign the actual painting.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\n==History==\nThe painting was first exhibited in the [[Royal Academy]] in [[London]] before being presented to King Edward VII by the Commonwealth Government in 1904. It was then moved to  [[St. James's Palace]] where it remained on display until 1957.<ref name=\"History\" /> That year, [[Robert Menzies]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] requested the permanent loan of the painting from  [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The Queen consented and the picture returned to Australia in 1958.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nThe picture was to be exhibited in the King's Hall of the then [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] with the other historic records of events as the opening of the first Parliament in Canberra in 1927 and the Royal opening of Parliament in 1954, however it was too big for the available space.<ref name=\"History\" /> The decision was made to store the painting at the [[Australian War Memorial]] after a tour of the various state galleries. In 1969, the painting was moved to the Parliament House basement where it remained until 1980.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nAs a result of its travels, the picture had deteriorated considerably and required major restoration work.<ref name=\"History\" />{{quote|The picture had long been unprotected from changes in temperature and humidity, it had been constantly rolled and unrolled and untacked from its stretcher frame. At one stage it was even folded in half for transport. All this seriously affected the canvas. It gradually sagged, undulated and malformed and was in danger of becoming completely dilapidated.|Katrina Rumley|quoted in Mackenzie.<ref name=\"History\" />}} The School of Materials Conservation at the [[University of Canberra|Canberra College of Advanced Education]] started restoration work in 1980. The work included infra-red and ultra-violet photography to determine the condition of the painting followed by removal of old varnish and grime, repairs to the tacking margin and restoration of some small areas of paint. The work was completed in time for it to be taken to the new [[High Court of Australia]] building for its official opening by the Queen in 1981.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nThe designers of the new [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] were mindful of the need to provide an appropriate space to display ''The Big Picture'' in the new building. The Joint Standing Committee responsible for the new building made the decision to place the painting in the Main Committee Room Foyer.  The architects worked to ensure that major design elements in the room such as the skylight and balustrade around the work allowed for the integration of the painting with the available space.<ref name=\"History\" /> Because the fragile state of the picture prevented it from being rolled, moving the painting from the High Court to Parliament House was a major logistical exercise. The move required removal of some windows at the High Court, the construction of a special carrying frame and scaffolding and a system of winches to support the picture in place.<ref name=\"History\" /> The painting remains in this specially designed location to this day.\n\nOn the occasion of the centenary of Federation in 2001, the [[Premier of Victoria]] [[Steve Bracks]] led a call for ownership of the painting to be formally transferred from the British Royal Collection to the [[Monarchy of Australia|Australian Crown]].
