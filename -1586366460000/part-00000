In 1785, Easthampton was established as a \u201cdistrict\u201d by Massachusetts (a former type of political entity with less independence than a [[New England town|town]]), and in 1809, it was incorporated as a town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth-oai:ht24wv90r|title=1809 Chap. 0011. An Act To Incorporate The District Of Easthampton, In The County Of Hampshire, Into A Town By The Name Of Easthampton.|website=www.digitalcommonwealth.org}}</ref> Easthampton is the youngest town in Hampshire County by date of incorporation. (It was not, however, the last incorporated; two of the three disincorporated towns of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]] in Hampshire County, [[Enfield, Massachusetts|Enfield]] and [[Prescott, Massachusetts|Prescott]], were incorporated afterwards.)\n\nThe town grew primarily around the [[Manhan River]], both through its phase as a strictly agricultural community and later, through the [[Industrial Revolution]], when mills and factories were first built in Easthampton, mainly in connection with [[textile manufacturing]] and its offshoots. The first of these, the Williston-Knight Button Company, was established in 1847 by Samuel Williston, son of the town's first minister, a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] named Payson Williston. The company specialized in cloth-covered buttons \u2013 a coveted item at the time \u2013 and to facilitate the operation of the machinery, a local brook was dammed, creating Nashawannuck Pond. Other mills soon opened nearby, a number of them specializing in elastic and rubber thread manufacturing.\n\nFollowing this spurt of industrial development, the town's first [[High school (North America)|high school]] and first national bank opened in 1864, and a [[town hall]] was built in 1869. Constables were replaced by the town's first police officer in 1871, the same year that Easthampton became a regular stop on the [[railroad]]. The town's public [[library]] opened in 1881, and fourteen years later in 1895 the community was introduced to two new innovations, telephones and streetcars. With the influx of new residents came a number of new churches, founded for [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]], [[Lutheran]], and [[Methodist]] parishioners, as well as a second Congregational church. In 1899, the West Boylston Manufacturing Company and the Hampton Company, both specializing in cloth production, moved to Easthampton, recruiting a larger immigrant labor force, particularly from [[Poland]] and [[French Canada|Canada]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the town's mills all obtained federal wartime contracts and did well financially, but long before the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] hit, many factories owners were already laying off employees, seeking [[merger]]s with other companies, or looking for buyers for their facilities.\n\n[[World War II]] provided some relief for the Easthampton economy, as several of the older textile companies as well as newer heavy manufacturing corporations received another round of federal contracts. However, beginning in the early 1960s a number of critical closures hit the town hard. Revitalization attempts began with the opening of a new [[industrial park]] and continued with a joint government-private industrial mall which has failed to solve significantly higher rates of unemployment and poverty compared to Hampshire County.\n\nSmall farms and well-established small businesses remain the economic core of Easthampton. Easthampton changed its charter in 1996 to become a city. The downtown area since 1996 has attracted a small community of artists and young people migrating due to Easthampton's lower [[cost of living]] compared to nearby Northampton, a hub of the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] community regionally. Small stores around Main Street, Union Street, and Cottage Street have changed business due to the influx of this new demographic. This growth has produced new arts and cultural events such as the monthly Art Walk Easthampton, held each \"Second Saturday\", in which visual, music and performance artists showcase their talents at venues around the city.  In November 2018, the administration of [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Charlie Baker]] announced a $3.5 million grant through the MassWorks program to the Ferry Street Mill redevelopment project in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baker-Polito Administration Announces $3.5 Million MassWorks Award for Easthampton|website=www.mass.gov|url=https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-announces-35-million-massworks-award-for-easthampton|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=December 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nEasthampton is just south of the geographic center of Hampshire County. It is bordered by [[Southampton, Massachusetts|Southampton]] and [[Westhampton, Massachusetts|Westhampton]] to its west, by [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]] in [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]] to its east and south, and by [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] to its north. It also has a river boundary with [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] to its northeast across the [[Connecticut River]]. The western flanks of [[Mount Tom (Massachusetts)|Mount Tom]] and [[Mount Nonotuck]] form its eastern boundary.\n\n[[Massachusetts Route 10]] passes through the center of Easthampton as Main Street and Northampton Street, leading northeast {{convert|5|mi|0}} to the center of Northampton and southwest {{convert|4|mi|0}} to Southampton. [[Massachusetts Route 141]] (Union Street, Cottage Street, and Holyoke Street) leads southeast from the center of Easthampton {{convert|6|mi|0}} past Mount Tom to Holyoke. [[Interstate 91]] and [[U.S. Route 5]] cross the northeast tip of Easthampton near the Connecticut River, leading north to Northampton and south to Holyoke.\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city of Easthampton has a total area of {{convert|35.2|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|34.5|sqkm|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.7|sqkm|order=flip|1}}, or 2.02%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> The [[Manhan River]] crosses Easthampton north of the city center, flowing into [[The Oxbow (Connecticut River)|The Oxbow]], a former channel of the Connecticut River, at the northeast end of the city.\n\n==Education==\n\nIn 1797, the town was divided into four school districts. By the middle of the 19th century, the town offered over twelve small schools. Over the following century, the town began to reduce the number of small schools and to build schools suited for higher volume. In 1897, an eight-room school was constructed on Maple Street. The Maple Street School was later enlarged to 16 rooms. The junior high school was consolidated here from 1950 to 1962. After 1962, this school was used for elementary classes.\n\n[[Mount Holyoke College]] graduate Sarah Chapin, the last principal of girls at Williston Seminary, became the town's first high school principal in 1864. Chapin designed the initial curriculum, and served as principal until ill health in 1891. She retired with the class of 1901 and died that summer. In 1864, Williston Seminary decided to stop offering classes for girls. The town constructed a two-story school for use as the town's first high school. In 1912, the school district constructed a new high school and enlarged this building (then called Park Primary School) using brick salvaged from the Center Union School. It was used as an elementary school until 1939 and again from the 1950s to the 1970s. This building, now called the Memorial Building, is currently being used as municipal offices.\n\nIn 1902, the town responded to the population increase resulting from the growth of the West Boylston and Hampton Companies. The Center Street School, an eight-room school, replaced the Center Union School. In 1920, the interior of this building was reconfigured as a 12-room school. It has served as a middle school, high school, and grade school. Replacing the Lovefield Street School in 1902, the Parsons Street School was built to serve children in the New City section of town.\n\nIn 1912, a new high school was built. An eight-room school was expanded in 1934, adding a gymnasium and an auditorium. After a new high school was built in 1962, this building was used for a junior high school and middle school. In 1975, it was converted for use as a grade school. Now known as the [[Neil A. Pepin School]], it is still a grammar school.<ref>Dwyer, Edward. ''Images of America; Easthampton''. 1st ed. Charleston, Chicago, Portsmouth, San Francisco: Arcadia Publishing, 2000. 85-94. Print.</ref>\n\nCurrently, the town has three elementary schools (Neil A. Pepin School, Center Street School, and Maple Street School), a middle school ([[White Brook Middle School]]), and a high school (Easthampton High School), which was built in 2013. It has a private Roman Catholic school, Notre Dame-Immaculate Conception School.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greatschools.org/massachusetts/easthampton/2093-Notre-Dame-Immaculate-Conception-School/ |title=Notre Dame-Immaculate Conception School - Easthampton, Massachusetts - MA - School overview |publisher=}}</ref>\nAlso, there is Hilltown Cooperative Charter Public School (K-8).<ref>http://www.hilltowncharter.org/</ref>  Lastly, The Williston Northampton School, a private prep school (7-12) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boardingschoolreview.com/the-williston-northampton-school-profile|title=The Williston Northampton School Profile (2020) &#124; Easthampton, MA|website=Boarding School Review}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|1850|1342\n|1860|1916\n|1870|3620\n|1880|4206\n|1890|4395\n|1900|5603\n|1910|8524\n|1920|11261\n|1930|11323\n|1940|10316\n|1950|10694\n|1960|12326\n|1970|13012\n|1980|15580\n|1990|15537\n|2000|15994\n|2010|16053\n|2018|15987\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref></center>\n|footnote=* = population estimate.

In 1785, Easthampton was established as a \u201cdistrict\u201d by Massachusetts (a former type of political entity with less independence than a [[New England town|town]]), and in 1809, it was incorporated as a town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth-oai:ht24wv90r|title=1809 Chap. 0011. An Act To Incorporate The District Of Easthampton, In The County Of Hampshire, Into A Town By The Name Of Easthampton.|website=www.digitalcommonwealth.org}}</ref> Easthampton is the youngest town in Hampshire County by date of incorporation. (It was not, however, the last incorporated; two of the three disincorporated towns of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]] in Hampshire County, [[Enfield, Massachusetts|Enfield]] and [[Prescott, Massachusetts|Prescott]], were incorporated afterwards.)\n\nThe town grew primarily around the [[Manhan River]], both through its phase as a strictly agricultural community and later, through the [[Industrial Revolution]], when mills and factories were first built in Easthampton, mainly in connection with [[textile manufacturing]] and its offshoots. The first of these, the Williston-Knight Button Company, was established in 1847 by Samuel Williston, son of the town's first minister, a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] named Payson Williston. The company specialized in cloth-covered buttons \u2013 a coveted item at the time \u2013 and to facilitate the operation of the machinery, a local brook was dammed, creating Nashawannuck Pond. Other mills soon opened nearby, a number of them specializing in elastic and rubber thread manufacturing.\n\nFollowing this spurt of industrial development, the town's first [[High school (North America)|high school]] and first national bank opened in 1864, and a [[town hall]] was built in 1869. Constables were replaced by the town's first police officer in 1871, the same year that Easthampton became a regular stop on the [[railroad]]. The town's public [[library]] opened in 1881, and fourteen years later in 1895 the community was introduced to two new innovations, telephones and streetcars. With the influx of new residents came a number of new churches, founded for [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]], [[Lutheran]], and [[Methodist]] parishioners, as well as a second Congregational church. In 1899, the West Boylston Manufacturing Company and the Hampton Company, both specializing in cloth production, moved to Easthampton, recruiting a larger immigrant labor force, particularly from [[Poland]] and [[French Canada|Canada]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the town's mills all obtained federal wartime contracts and did well financially, but long before the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] hit, many factories owners were already laying off employees, seeking [[merger]]s with other companies, or looking for buyers for their facilities.\n\n[[World War II]] provided some relief for the Easthampton economy, as several of the older textile companies as well as newer heavy manufacturing corporations received another round of federal contracts. However, beginning in the early 1960s a number of critical closures hit the town hard. Revitalization attempts began with the opening of a new [[industrial park]] and continued with a joint government-private industrial mall which has failed to solve significantly higher rates of unemployment and poverty compared to Hampshire County.\n\nSmall farms and well-established small businesses remain the economic core of Easthampton. Easthampton changed its charter in 1996 to become a city. The downtown area since 1996 has attracted a small community of artists and young people migrating due to Easthampton's lower [[cost of living]] compared to nearby Northampton, a hub of the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] community regionally. Small stores around Main Street, Union Street, and Cottage Street have changed business due to the influx of this new demographic. This growth has produced new arts and cultural events such as the monthly Art Walk Easthampton, held each \"Second Saturday\", in which visual, music and performance artists showcase their talents at venues around the city.  In November 2018, the administration of [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Charlie Baker]] announced a $3.5 million grant through the MassWorks program to the Ferry Street Mill redevelopment project in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baker-Polito Administration Announces $3.5 Million MassWorks Award for Easthampton|website=www.mass.gov|url=https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-announces-35-million-massworks-award-for-easthampton|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=December 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nEasthampton is just south of the geographic center of Hampshire County. It is bordered by [[Southampton, Massachusetts|Southampton]] and [[Westhampton, Massachusetts|Westhampton]] to its west, by [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]] in [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]] to its east and south, and by [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] to its north. It also has a river boundary with [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] to its northeast across the [[Connecticut River]]. The western flanks of [[Mount Tom (Massachusetts)|Mount Tom]] and [[Mount Nonotuck]] form its eastern boundary.\n\n[[Massachusetts Route 10]] passes through the center of Easthampton as Main Street and Northampton Street, leading northeast {{convert|5|mi|0}} to the center of Northampton and southwest {{convert|4|mi|0}} to Southampton. [[Massachusetts Route 141]] (Union Street, Cottage Street, and Holyoke Street) leads southeast from the center of Easthampton {{convert|6|mi|0}} past Mount Tom to Holyoke. [[Interstate 91]] and [[U.S. Route 5]] cross the northeast tip of Easthampton near the Connecticut River, leading north to Northampton and south to Holyoke.\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city of Easthampton has a total area of {{convert|35.2|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|34.5|sqkm|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.7|sqkm|order=flip|1}}, or 2.02%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> The [[Manhan River]] crosses Easthampton north of the city center, flowing into [[The Oxbow (Connecticut River)|The Oxbow]], a former channel of the Connecticut River, at the northeast end of the city.\n\n==Education==\n\nIn 1797, the town was divided into four school districts. By the middle of the 19th century, the town offered over twelve small schools. Over the following century, the town began to reduce the number of small schools and to build schools suited for higher volume. In 1897, an eight-room school was constructed on Maple Street. The Maple Street School was later enlarged to 16 rooms. The junior high school was consolidated here from 1950 to 1962. After 1962, this school was used for elementary classes.\n\n[[Mount Holyoke College]] graduate Sarah Chapin, the last principal of girls at Williston Seminary, became the town's first high school principal in 1864. Chapin designed the initial curriculum, and served as principal until ill health in 1891. She retired with the class of 1901 and died that summer. In 1864, Williston Seminary decided to stop offering classes for girls. The town constructed a two-story school for use as the town's first high school. In 1912, the school district constructed a new high school and enlarged this building (then called Park Primary School) using brick salvaged from the Center Union School. It was used as an elementary school until 1939 and again from the 1950s to the 1970s. This building, now called the Memorial Building, is currently being used as municipal offices.\n\nIn 1902, the town responded to the population increase resulting from the growth of the West Boylston and Hampton Companies. The Center Street School, an eight-room school, replaced the Center Union School. In 1920, the interior of this building was reconfigured as a 12-room school. It has served as a middle school, high school, and grade school. Replacing the Lovefield Street School in 1902, the Parsons Street School was built to serve children in the New City section of town.\n\nIn 1912, a new high school was built. An eight-room school was expanded in 1934, adding a gymnasium and an auditorium. After a new high school was built in 1962, this building was used for a junior high school and middle school. In 1975, it was converted for use as a grade school. Now known as the [[Neil A. Pepin School]], it is still a grammar school.<ref>Dwyer, Edward. ''Images of America; Easthampton''. 1st ed. Charleston, Chicago, Portsmouth, San Francisco: Arcadia Publishing, 2000. 85-94. Print.</ref>\n\nCurrently, the town has three elementary schools (Neil A. Pepin School, Center Street School, and Maple Street School), a middle school ([[White Brook Middle School]]), and a high school (Easthampton High School), which was built in 2013. It has a private Roman Catholic school, Notre Dame-Immaculate Conception School.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greatschools.org/massachusetts/easthampton/2093-Notre-Dame-Immaculate-Conception-School/ |title=Notre Dame-Immaculate Conception School - Easthampton, Massachusetts - MA - School overview |publisher=}}</ref>\nAlso, there is Hilltown Cooperative Charter Public School (K-8).<ref>http://www.hilltowncharter.org/</ref>  Lastly, The Williston Northampton School, a private prep school (7-12) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boardingschoolreview.com/the-williston-northampton-school-profile|title=The Williston Northampton School Profile (2020) &#124; Easthampton, MA|website=Boarding School Review}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|1850|1342\n|1860|1916\n|1870|3620\n|1880|4206\n|1890|4395\n|1900|5603\n|1910|8524\n|1920|11261\n|1930|11323\n|1940|10316\n|1950|10694\n|1960|12326\n|1970|13012\n|1980|15580\n|1990|15537\n|2000|15994\n|2010|16053\n|2018|15987\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref></center>\n|footnote=* = population estimate.

The [[town council]] replaced town meeting as the legislative branch and consists of four at-large members and five district councilors. In 1999 the mayor and council petitioned the General Court to remove the word \"town\" from its name and to replace the word town with \"city\".{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Mayor Tautznik was elected to an eighth term in November 2010. In November 2013, Karen Cadieux was elected mayor after Mayor Tautznik did not seek reelection. In 2017, lawyer Nicole LaChapelle defeated long-time district councilor Joy Winnie to become the city's next mayor.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! colspan = 6 | Voter Registration and Party Enrollment as of October 15, 2008<ref>{{cite web|title = Registration and Party Enrollment Statistics as of October 15, 2008 | publisher = Massachusetts Elections Division | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-05-08 | url = http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/st_county_town_enroll_breakdown_08.pdf}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party \n!

Before the events in ''The Bourne Identity'', Webb had a Thai wife named Dao and two children named Joshua and Alyssa in [[Phnom Penh]].  Webb's wife and two children were inadvertently killed during the [[Vietnam War]] when a fighter plane strayed into Cambodia, dropped two [[bomb]]s, and strafed a spot near the [[Mekong River]]. However, unknown to Bourne, Joshua survived.<ref>Lustbader, Eric Van. ''The Bourne Legacy''. St. Martin's Press, 2004.</ref> Due to Cambodia's [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in the war, every nation disclaimed the plane, and, therefore, no one took responsibility for the incident. Infuriated by both the utter injustice and randomness of his loss, Webb went to [[Saigon]] and, under the careful guidance of friend and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Alexander Conklin, ended up training for an elite Top Secret Special Forces unit called \"Medusa\". Within that select organization Webb was known only by his code name, \"Delta One\".\n\n=== Medusa ===\nAn assassination team or [[death squad]], \"Medusa\" was created to infiltrate [[Northern Vietnam]] and assassinate members of the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|Viet Cong]] and its collaborators. Its members were criminals; its leader, a man called Delta, ran \"Medusa\" with an iron fist. He became well known for his ruthlessness, his disregard for orders, and his disturbing success rate on his missions, resulting in the kidnapping of Webb's brother, U.S. Army Lieutenant Gordon Webb, during his tour of duty in Saigon.\n\nDuring the mission to save David Webb's brother, an original \"Medusa\" team member named \"Jason Charles Bourne\" was discovered to be a double agent who alerted a large number of North Vietnamese soldiers to their whereabouts. When Delta found Bourne after killing his way through the North Vietnamese, he simply killed Bourne in the jungles of Tam Quan. Bourne's murder was never exposed due to the Top Secret status of \"Medusa\".\n\n=== Operation Treadstone ===\nYears later, a [[black ops]] arm of the CIA was formed to eliminate the notorious [[Carlos the Jackal]] and called \"Treadstone Seventy-One\", named after a building on New York's Seventy-First Street, and Webb was called up by the creator of Treadstone and Medusa, David Abbott, who was nicknamed \"The Monk\" (short for \"The Silent Monk of Covert Operations\") to be its principal agent.  At this point, Webb (Delta) takes the identity of Jason Bourne due to the actual Bourne's status as MIA in the war as well as the fact that Bourne was in reality a ruthless killer with a long criminal record. The point of all this was to turn Jason Bourne into something more than he really was, a contract assassin who would be known all over the world for terminating the lives of just about anyone. The assassin's alias was \"Cain\". The reasoning for creating such a myth was to create competition for the well-known assassin named \"Carlos\", or \"Carlos the Jackal\" (real name [[Ilich Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez]]) who at that time was considered the world's best and most famous assassin. The name Cain was chosen because it had some significance for what he was doing. During Vietnam, Cain was used instead of Charlie in the [[ICAO spelling alphabet|phonetic alphabet]] (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot...) because Charlie became synonymous with Viet Cong. So Delta dropped back one letter to Cain, which stood for Charlie. In Spanish, Charlie is Carlos; Carlos was Venezuelan. The myth of Cain was created by having Cain take credit for any well-publicized killings that took place in Asia, and later in Europe, regardless of the circumstances. By creating this myth, Cain was to drive the reclusive Carlos out in the open \"long enough to put a bullet in his head\". To add insult to Carlos's name, Cain stole the credit for Carlos's kills, even when Cain had no part in them.\n\n== Film backstory ==\nIn the film series, Jason Bourne was born as David Webb on September 13, 1970 in [[Nixa, Missouri]] (although in ''Ultimatum'', he was given a false date of April 15, 1971, as a coded reference to a specific site). He joined the [[United States Army]] and was eventually selected for [[Delta Force]] in 1998. His father, Richard Webb, a senior [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst, created the Treadstone program, a black ops project intended to train and deploy elite assassins. He was monitored by the CIA, which murdered his father with a car bomb in [[Beirut]] in a bid to recruit Webb.\n\nThe ploy worked; Webb approached the CIA and was brought into the program by Neil Daniels, a supervisor in the Treadstone program, and was monitored by Dr. Albert Hirsch, who supervised the medical assessment of the Treadstone agents. He was brought into a secret recruitment center in [[New York City]], where Hirsch ordered him tortured for days \u2014 via [[waterboarding]] and sleep deprivation \u2014 to break his spirit and allow him to be molded into an assassin. He was officially accepted when he murdered an unidentified man (implied to be the real Jason Bourne) without questioning. After that, he was given a new identity as Jason Bourne, and his birth identity was dropped.\n\nAfter heavy training, in which he learned several languages and mastered several martial arts skills, Bourne was placed in the Treadstone program, whose missions were run by the CIA's Alexander Conklin. His first assignment, an unofficial one, was in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]], where he assassinated Vladimir Neski, a [[Russian people|Russian]] politician who was intending to expose the theft of $20 million in black funds stolen from the CIA by Treadstone's Director, Ward Abbott, and a Russian oligarch, Yuri Gretkov. Under Conklin's orders, Bourne murdered Neski and his wife and arranged it as a murder-suicide.\n\nBourne worked in the program for three years, during which he was considered its top agent because he could adapt to his surroundings, think laterally, and execute assassinations that looked like accidents. He was stationed in [[Paris|Paris, France]], maintaining a secluded life while performing assassinations, mostly around Europe. His official handler was a logistics agent, Nicky Parsons, also stationed in Paris, with whom he was implied to have some sort of a romantic relationship kept secret from his Treadstone employers.\n\nThe turning point in his life came when he was ordered to murder Nykwana Wombosi, an exiled African warlord who was blackmailing the CIA into reinstating him as head of his state, lest he expose several CIA secrets. Using an alias, John Michael Kane, Bourne gathered information on Wombosi. He infiltrated the warlord's yacht and hid inside it for five days, surfacing on a cold night in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, intending to arrange the murder to look like he was killed by a crew member to avoid suspicion. However, Wombosi was surrounded by his children, and Bourne was unable to bring himself to kill him. He tried to abandon the mission by leaving the boat, but an unknown shooter shot him twice in the back, sending him off the yacht into the sea and triggering amnesia, causing Webb / Bourne to forget his identity.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Novels ===\n\nThe series has included fourteen novels which have been written by two authors, [[Robert Ludlum]] and [[Eric Van Lustbader]]. Ludlum's series include the first three books, dubbed the [[Bourne (novel series)|Bourne trilogy]]. After Ludlum's death in 2001, Lustbader took over the character in his own series of novels, which span eleven books so far, with a twelfth (''The Bourne Nemesis'') currently being completed.\n\n==== Written by Robert Ludlum ====\n\n===== ''The Bourne Identity'' (1980) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Identity (novel)}}\n\nA man is found floating unconscious in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] near [[Marseille]] by Italian fishermen with two gunshot wounds in his back. He wakes and discovers he is suffering from [[Psychogenic amnesia|extreme memory loss]]. Film negative embedded in his hip leads him to a bank in Zurich where he learns he is known by the name Jason Bourne. As he tries to reclaim his memory, Bourne attracts the attention of hostile people for reasons unknown to him. At a hotel, while cornered, Bourne takes a young woman, Marie St. Jacques, hostage to escape. Marie is an employee of the [[Government of Canada]]. Bourne and Marie discover that \"Jason Bourne\" is the cover identity of a contract assassin, and that both the CIA and another contract killer known as [[Carlos the Jackal]] have an interest in him. Marie is convinced that this man she has come to know cannot be the ruthless killer that all their discoveries seem to imply. She compels Bourne to continue searching for his true identity and, in the end, he finds the truth. Through this time, Bourne has the phrase \"Cain is for Charlie, and Delta is for Cain\" continually flash through his mind, propelling him in the direction of his mission.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Supremacy'' (1986) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Supremacy}}\n\nHaving recovered his memory and retired from the CIA, David Webb now teaches Asian studies at a university in Maine and lives with Marie. She is taken captive seemingly by a powerful Chinese [[drug lord]], but in reality, by the United States government using the fictitious drug lord as cover. The scheme is an attempt to turn Webb back into his former self, the mythical Jason Bourne, to go after a Bourne impostor in China. The phony Bourne has been credited with a Far East political assassination that could, in a worst-case scenario, cause a Chinese [[civil war]] over the ownership of [[Hong Kong]].\n\n===== ''The Bourne Ultimatum'' (1990) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Ultimatum}}\n\nAs Carlos the Jackal enters old age and his infamy fades, he decides that he will do two things before he dies: kill Jason Bourne and destroy the [[KGB]] facility of Novgorod, where the Jackal was trained and later turned away. Webb's family is forced to hide in the Caribbean while Webb himself works with old friend and CIA officer Alex Conklin to hunt down and kill the Jackal first. Webb poses as an important member of Medusa, now a nearly omnipotent economic force that controls the commander of [[NATO]], leading figures in the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]], and large [[NYSE]] firms. The plan is to use Medusa's resources to contact the Jackal. Webb just misses the Jackal several times before Webb feigns his own death and convinces the Jackal that he has succeeded. Following this, the Jackal turns to his second goal. Webb tracks the Jackal down with the help of Conklin and a KGB agent as the Jackal begins destroying the KGB compound. In a final confrontation, the Jackal is led into a dam lock in which he drowns and Webb returns to his family.\n\n==== Written by Eric Van Lustbader ====\n\n===== ''The Bourne Legacy'' (2004) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Legacy (novel)}}\n\nWith the climactic events of ''The Bourne Ultimatum'' behind him, Jason Bourne is able to once again become David Webb, now professor of linguistics at Georgetown University. However, this serenity does not last for long. When a silenced gunshot narrowly misses Webb's head, the Bourne persona reawakens in him. His first objective is to reach his long-time friend and handler at the CIA, Alex Conklin. However, unknown to Bourne, a Hungarian by the name of Stepan Spalko has now drawn Jason into a web\u2014one which he cannot escape as easily as his professional fa\u00e7ade. And the man who nearly killed him in Georgetown continues his deadly, intensely personal pursuit.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Betrayal'' (2007) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Betrayal}}\n\nJason Bourne takes a mission to rescue his only friend in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], Martin Lindros, who disappeared in [[Africa]] while tracking shipments of [[uranium]]. Once safely back in America, Lindros persuades Bourne to help track the money trail of [[terrorists]] buying the nuclear material in [[Odessa]]. But once there, Bourne is hampered by confusing flashbacks of unfamiliar places and events and he wonders if someone is brainwashing him in order to throw him off the trail, or worse, if the man he saved in Africa is really Martin Lindros. Now, Bourne must gather evidence while trying to stay one step ahead of the terrorists who won't let anyone stand in their way.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Sanction'' (2008) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Sanction}}\n\nJason Bourne returns to [[Georgetown University]], and the mild world of his alter ego, David Webb, hoping for normality. But, after so many adrenaline-soaked years of risking his life, Bourne finds himself chafing under the quiet life of a linguistics professor. Aware of his frustrations, his academic mentor, Professor Spector, asks for help investigating the murder of a former student. The young man died carrying information about a group's terrorist activities, including an immediate plan to attack the United States. The organization, the Black Legion, and its plot have also popped up on the radar of the Central Intelligence Agency, whose new director Veronica Hart is struggling to assert her authority. Sensing an opportunity to take control of the CIA by showing Hart's incompetence, National Security Agency operatives attempt to accomplish what the CIA never could do, hunt down and kill Jason Bourne. In Europe, Bourne's investigation into the Black Legion turns into one of the deadliest and most tangled operations of his double life\u2014while an assassin is getting closer by the minute.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Deception'' (2009) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Deception}}\n\nBourne's nemesis, Arkadin, is still hot on his trail, and the two continue their struggle, reversing roles of hunter and hunted. When Bourne is ambushed and badly wounded, he fakes his death and goes into hiding. In safety, he takes on a new identity, and begins a mission to find out who tried to assassinate him. Jason begins to question who he really is, how much of him is tied up in the Bourne identity, and what he would become if that was suddenly taken away from him. Meanwhile, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt by what seems to be an Iranian missile. A massive global investigative team is assembled to get at the truth of the situation before it can escalate into an international scandal. Bourne's search for the man who shot him intersects with the search for the people who brought down the airliner, leading Bourne into one of the most deadly and challenging situations he has ever encountered. With the threat of a new world war brewing, Bourne finds himself in a race against time to uncover the truth and find the person behind his assault, all the while being stalked by his unknown nemesis.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Objective'' (2010) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Objective}}\n\n''The Bourne Objective'' is the eighth novel in the Bourne series, and the fifth written by Eric Van Lustbader. The book was released in 2010, sequel to ''The Bourne Deception''.\nThe killing of an art dealer dredges up snatches of Jason Bourne's impaired memory, in particular the murder of a young woman who entrusted him with a strangely engraved ring. Now he's determined to find its owner and purpose. But Bourne never knows what terrible acts he'll discover he committed when he digs into the past.\nThe trail will lead him to a vicious Russian mercenary, Leonid Arkadin, also a graduate of the Central Intelligence training program Treadstone. The covert course was shuttered by Congress for corruption, but not before it produced Bourne and Arkadin, giving them equal skills, equal force, and equal cunning.\nAs Bourne's destiny circles closer to Arkadin's, it becomes clear that someone else has been watching and manipulating them.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Dominion'' (2011) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Dominion}}\n\nJason Bourne is searching for an elusive cadre of terrorists planning to destroy America's most strategic natural resources\u2014and needs the help of his longtime friend, General Boris Karpov. Karpov, the newly appointed head of Russia's most feared spy agency, FSB-2, is one of the most determined, honorable, and justice-hungry men that Bourne knows. But Karpov has made a deal with the devil. In order to remain the head of FSB-2, he must hunt down and kill Bourne. Now, these two trusted friends are on a deadly collision course. From the Colombian highlands to [[Munich]], [[C\u00e1diz]], and [[Damascus]], the clock is counting down to a disaster that will cripple America's economic and military future. Only Bourne and Karpov have a chance to avert the catastrophe\u2014but if they destroy each other first, that chance will be gone forever.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Imperative'' (2012) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Imperative}}\n\nThe tenth book in the series was published on June 5, 2012. The man Jason Bourne fished out of the freezing sea is near death, half-drowned and bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound. He awakens with no memory of who he is or why he was shot, and Bourne is eerily reminded of his own amnesia. Then Bourne discovers that the Mossad agent named Rebeka is so determined to find this injured man that she has gone off the grid, cut her ties to her agency, and is now being stalked by Mossad's most feared killer. The answers to these mysteries may lie back in southeast Lebanon, in a secret encampment to which Bourne and Rebeka escaped following a firefight weeks ago. The complex trail links to the mission given to Treadstone directors Peter Marks and Soraya Moore: find the semi-mythic terrorist assassin known as Nicodemo. In the course of Bourne's desperate, deadly search for a secret that will alter the future of the entire world, he will experience both triumph and loss, and his life will never be the same. Now everything turns on the amnesiac. Bourne must learn his identity and purpose before both he and Rebeka are killed. From [[Stockholm]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], from [[Mexico City]] to [[Beijing]], the web of lies and betrayals extends into a worldwide conspiracy of monumental proportions.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Retribution'' (2013) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Retribution}}\n\nThe eleventh book in the series was published on December 3, 2013. Bourne's friend Eli Yadin, head of Mossad, learns that Ouyang Jidan, a senior member of China's Politburo, and a major Mexican drug lord may have been trafficking in more than drugs.

Bourne is determined to avenge her death, but in the process he becomes enmeshed in a monstrous worldwide scheme involving the Chinese, Mexicans, and Russians.

The TV movie was largely faithful to Robert Ludlum's novel, both in plot as well as in the portrayal of the character of Jason Bourne.\n\nA spin-off of the Universal-produced film franchise entitled ''[[Treadstone]]'' began airing in October 2019 on [[USA Network]]. It explores the origins of the Treadstone program and operatives other than Bourne. Producer Ben Smith, who worked on the recent two ''Bourne'' films, said the show will tie into the next film in the franchise.<ref>https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481543/another-bourne-movie-is-in-the-works-and-itll-tie-into-the-treadstone-tv-show</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\n{{Main|Bourne (film series)}}\n[[File:Matt Damon TIFF 2015.jpg|thumb|Actor Matt Damon, who portrays Jason Bourne in the film series]]\nThe Jason Bourne novels were adapted into a series of films \u2013 ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (2002), ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' (2004), ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007), ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]'' (2012), and ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'' (2016). The films retain the titles and some base elements but otherwise feature different plots independent of the novels. In these films, Bourne is portrayed by [[Matt Damon]].\n\nBourne does not appear in ''The Bourne Legacy'', with the exception of his picture being featured in the film as well as brief discussions of how he's caused problems to the organization he worked for. As  a result, the film focuses on the fallout in the intelligence community from Bourne's actions in ''Ultimatum''.

St. Martin's Press, 2004.</ref> Due to Cambodia's [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in the war, every nation disclaimed the plane, and, therefore, no one took responsibility for the incident. Infuriated by both the utter injustice and randomness of his loss, Webb went to [[Saigon]] and, under the careful guidance of friend and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Alexander Conklin, ended up training for an elite Top Secret Special Forces unit called \"Medusa\". Within that select organization Webb was known only by his code name, \"Delta One\".\n\n=== Medusa ===\nAn assassination team or [[death squad]], \"Medusa\" was created to infiltrate [[Northern Vietnam]] and assassinate members of the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|Viet Cong]] and its collaborators. Its members were criminals; its leader, a man called Delta, ran \"Medusa\" with an iron fist. He became well known for his ruthlessness, his disregard for orders, and his disturbing success rate on his missions, resulting in the kidnapping of Webb's brother, U.S. Army Lieutenant Gordon Webb, during his tour of duty in Saigon.\n\nDuring the mission to save David Webb's brother, an original \"Medusa\" team member named \"Jason Charles Bourne\" was discovered to be a double agent who alerted a large number of North Vietnamese soldiers to their whereabouts. When Delta found Bourne after killing his way through the North Vietnamese, he simply killed Bourne in the jungles of Tam Quan. Bourne's murder was never exposed due to the Top Secret status of \"Medusa\".\n\n=== Operation Treadstone ===\nYears later, a [[black ops]] arm of the CIA was formed to eliminate the notorious [[Carlos the Jackal]] and called \"Treadstone Seventy-One\", named after a building on New York's Seventy-First Street, and Webb was called up by the creator of Treadstone and Medusa, David Abbott, who was nicknamed \"The Monk\" (short for \"The Silent Monk of Covert Operations\") to be its principal agent.  At this point, Webb (Delta) takes the identity of Jason Bourne due to the actual Bourne's status as MIA in the war as well as the fact that Bourne was in reality a ruthless killer with a long criminal record. The point of all this was to turn Jason Bourne into something more than he really was, a contract assassin who would be known all over the world for terminating the lives of just about anyone. The assassin's alias was \"Cain\". The reasoning for creating such a myth was to create competition for the well-known assassin named \"Carlos\", or \"Carlos the Jackal\" (real name [[Ilich Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez]]) who at that time was considered the world's best and most famous assassin. The name Cain was chosen because it had some significance for what he was doing. During Vietnam, Cain was used instead of Charlie in the [[ICAO spelling alphabet|phonetic alphabet]] (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot...) because Charlie became synonymous with Viet Cong. So Delta dropped back one letter to Cain, which stood for Charlie. In Spanish, Charlie is Carlos; Carlos was Venezuelan. The myth of Cain was created by having Cain take credit for any well-publicized killings that took place in Asia, and later in Europe, regardless of the circumstances. By creating this myth, Cain was to drive the reclusive Carlos out in the open \"long enough to put a bullet in his head\". To add insult to Carlos's name, Cain stole the credit for Carlos's kills, even when Cain had no part in them.\n\n== Film backstory ==\nIn the film series, Jason Bourne was born as David Webb on September 13, 1970 in [[Nixa, Missouri]] (although in ''Ultimatum'', he was given a false date of April 15, 1971, as a coded reference to a specific site). He joined the [[United States Army]] and was eventually selected for [[Delta Force]] in 1998. His father, Richard Webb, a senior [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst, created the Treadstone program, a black ops project intended to train and deploy elite assassins. He was monitored by the CIA, which murdered his father with a car bomb in [[Beirut]] in a bid to recruit Webb.\n\nThe ploy worked; Webb approached the CIA and was brought into the program by Neil Daniels, a supervisor in the Treadstone program, and was monitored by Dr. Albert Hirsch, who supervised the medical assessment of the Treadstone agents. He was brought into a secret recruitment center in [[New York City]], where Hirsch ordered him tortured for days \u2014 via [[waterboarding]] and sleep deprivation \u2014 to break his spirit and allow him to be molded into an assassin. He was officially accepted when he murdered an unidentified man (implied to be the real Jason Bourne) without questioning. After that, he was given a new identity as Jason Bourne, and his birth identity was dropped.\n\nAfter heavy training, in which he learned several languages and mastered several martial arts skills, Bourne was placed in the Treadstone program, whose missions were run by the CIA's Alexander Conklin. His first assignment, an unofficial one, was in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]], where he assassinated Vladimir Neski, a [[Russian people|Russian]] politician who was intending to expose the theft of $20 million in black funds stolen from the CIA by Treadstone's Director, Ward Abbott, and a Russian oligarch, Yuri Gretkov. Under Conklin's orders, Bourne murdered Neski and his wife and arranged it as a murder-suicide.\n\nBourne worked in the program for three years, during which he was considered its top agent because he could adapt to his surroundings, think laterally, and execute assassinations that looked like accidents. He was stationed in [[Paris|Paris, France]], maintaining a secluded life while performing assassinations, mostly around Europe. His official handler was a logistics agent, Nicky Parsons, also stationed in Paris, with whom he was implied to have some sort of a romantic relationship kept secret from his Treadstone employers.\n\nThe turning point in his life came when he was ordered to murder Nykwana Wombosi, an exiled African warlord who was blackmailing the CIA into reinstating him as head of his state, lest he expose several CIA secrets. Using an alias, John Michael Kane, Bourne gathered information on Wombosi. He infiltrated the warlord's yacht and hid inside it for five days, surfacing on a cold night in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, intending to arrange the murder to look like he was killed by a crew member to avoid suspicion. However, Wombosi was surrounded by his children, and Bourne was unable to bring himself to kill him. He tried to abandon the mission by leaving the boat, but an unknown shooter shot him twice in the back, sending him off the yacht into the sea and triggering amnesia, causing Webb / Bourne to forget his identity.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Novels ===\n\nThe series has included fourteen novels which have been written by two authors, [[Robert Ludlum]] and [[Eric Van Lustbader]]. Ludlum's series include the first three books, dubbed the [[Bourne (novel series)|Bourne trilogy]]. After Ludlum's death in 2001, Lustbader took over the character in his own series of novels, which span eleven books so far, with a twelfth (''The Bourne Nemesis'') currently being completed.\n\n==== Written by Robert Ludlum ====\n\n===== ''The Bourne Identity'' (1980) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Identity (novel)}}\n\nA man is found floating unconscious in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] near [[Marseille]] by Italian fishermen with two gunshot wounds in his back. He wakes and discovers he is suffering from [[Psychogenic amnesia|extreme memory loss]]. Film negative embedded in his hip leads him to a bank in Zurich where he learns he is known by the name Jason Bourne. As he tries to reclaim his memory, Bourne attracts the attention of hostile people for reasons unknown to him. At a hotel, while cornered, Bourne takes a young woman, Marie St. Jacques, hostage to escape. Marie is an employee of the [[Government of Canada]]. Bourne and Marie discover that \"Jason Bourne\" is the cover identity of a contract assassin, and that both the CIA and another contract killer known as [[Carlos the Jackal]] have an interest in him. Marie is convinced that this man she has come to know cannot be the ruthless killer that all their discoveries seem to imply. She compels Bourne to continue searching for his true identity and, in the end, he finds the truth. Through this time, Bourne has the phrase \"Cain is for Charlie, and Delta is for Cain\" continually flash through his mind, propelling him in the direction of his mission.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Supremacy'' (1986) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Supremacy}}\n\nHaving recovered his memory and retired from the CIA, David Webb now teaches Asian studies at a university in Maine and lives with Marie. She is taken captive seemingly by a powerful Chinese [[drug lord]], but in reality, by the United States government using the fictitious drug lord as cover. The scheme is an attempt to turn Webb back into his former self, the mythical Jason Bourne, to go after a Bourne impostor in China. The phony Bourne has been credited with a Far East political assassination that could, in a worst-case scenario, cause a Chinese [[civil war]] over the ownership of [[Hong Kong]].\n\n===== ''The Bourne Ultimatum'' (1990) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Ultimatum}}\n\nAs Carlos the Jackal enters old age and his infamy fades, he decides that he will do two things before he dies: kill Jason Bourne and destroy the [[KGB]] facility of Novgorod, where the Jackal was trained and later turned away. Webb's family is forced to hide in the Caribbean while Webb himself works with old friend and CIA officer Alex Conklin to hunt down and kill the Jackal first. Webb poses as an important member of Medusa, now a nearly omnipotent economic force that controls the commander of [[NATO]], leading figures in the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]], and large [[NYSE]] firms. The plan is to use Medusa's resources to contact the Jackal. Webb just misses the Jackal several times before Webb feigns his own death and convinces the Jackal that he has succeeded. Following this, the Jackal turns to his second goal. Webb tracks the Jackal down with the help of Conklin and a KGB agent as the Jackal begins destroying the KGB compound. In a final confrontation, the Jackal is led into a dam lock in which he drowns and Webb returns to his family.\n\n==== Written by Eric Van Lustbader ====\n\n===== ''The Bourne Legacy'' (2004) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Legacy (novel)}}\n\nWith the climactic events of ''The Bourne Ultimatum'' behind him, Jason Bourne is able to once again become David Webb, now professor of linguistics at Georgetown University. However, this serenity does not last for long. When a silenced gunshot narrowly misses Webb's head, the Bourne persona reawakens in him. His first objective is to reach his long-time friend and handler at the CIA, Alex Conklin. However, unknown to Bourne, a Hungarian by the name of Stepan Spalko has now drawn Jason into a web\u2014one which he cannot escape as easily as his professional fa\u00e7ade. And the man who nearly killed him in Georgetown continues his deadly, intensely personal pursuit.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Betrayal'' (2007) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Betrayal}}\n\nJason Bourne takes a mission to rescue his only friend in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], Martin Lindros, who disappeared in [[Africa]] while tracking shipments of [[uranium]]. Once safely back in America, Lindros persuades Bourne to help track the money trail of [[terrorists]] buying the nuclear material in [[Odessa]]. But once there, Bourne is hampered by confusing flashbacks of unfamiliar places and events and he wonders if someone is brainwashing him in order to throw him off the trail, or worse, if the man he saved in Africa is really Martin Lindros. Now, Bourne must gather evidence while trying to stay one step ahead of the terrorists who won't let anyone stand in their way.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Sanction'' (2008) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Sanction}}\n\nJason Bourne returns to [[Georgetown University]], and the mild world of his alter ego, David Webb, hoping for normality. But, after so many adrenaline-soaked years of risking his life, Bourne finds himself chafing under the quiet life of a linguistics professor. Aware of his frustrations, his academic mentor, Professor Spector, asks for help investigating the murder of a former student. The young man died carrying information about a group's terrorist activities, including an immediate plan to attack the United States. The organization, the Black Legion, and its plot have also popped up on the radar of the Central Intelligence Agency, whose new director Veronica Hart is struggling to assert her authority. Sensing an opportunity to take control of the CIA by showing Hart's incompetence, National Security Agency operatives attempt to accomplish what the CIA never could do, hunt down and kill Jason Bourne. In Europe, Bourne's investigation into the Black Legion turns into one of the deadliest and most tangled operations of his double life\u2014while an assassin is getting closer by the minute.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Deception'' (2009) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Deception}}\n\nBourne's nemesis, Arkadin, is still hot on his trail, and the two continue their struggle, reversing roles of hunter and hunted. When Bourne is ambushed and badly wounded, he fakes his death and goes into hiding. In safety, he takes on a new identity, and begins a mission to find out who tried to assassinate him. Jason begins to question who he really is, how much of him is tied up in the Bourne identity, and what he would become if that was suddenly taken away from him. Meanwhile, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt by what seems to be an Iranian missile. A massive global investigative team is assembled to get at the truth of the situation before it can escalate into an international scandal. Bourne's search for the man who shot him intersects with the search for the people who brought down the airliner, leading Bourne into one of the most deadly and challenging situations he has ever encountered. With the threat of a new world war brewing, Bourne finds himself in a race against time to uncover the truth and find the person behind his assault, all the while being stalked by his unknown nemesis.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Objective'' (2010) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Objective}}\n\n''The Bourne Objective'' is the eighth novel in the Bourne series, and the fifth written by Eric Van Lustbader.

Now he's determined to find its owner and purpose. But Bourne never knows what terrible acts he'll discover he committed when he digs into the past.\nThe trail will lead him to a vicious Russian mercenary, Leonid Arkadin, also a graduate of the Central Intelligence training program Treadstone. The covert course was shuttered by Congress for corruption, but not before it produced Bourne and Arkadin, giving them equal skills, equal force, and equal cunning.\nAs Bourne's destiny circles closer to Arkadin's, it becomes clear that someone else has been watching and manipulating them.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Dominion'' (2011) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Dominion}}\n\nJason Bourne is searching for an elusive cadre of terrorists planning to destroy America's most strategic natural resources\u2014and needs the help of his longtime friend, General Boris Karpov.

But Karpov has made a deal with the devil. In order to remain the head of FSB-2, he must hunt down and kill Bourne. Now, these two trusted friends are on a deadly collision course. From the Colombian highlands to [[Munich]], [[C\u00e1diz]], and [[Damascus]], the clock is counting down to a disaster that will cripple America's economic and military future.

The man Jason Bourne fished out of the freezing sea is near death, half-drowned and bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound.

Then Bourne discovers that the Mossad agent named Rebeka is so determined to find this injured man that she has gone off the grid, cut her ties to her agency, and is now being stalked by Mossad's most feared killer. The answers to these mysteries may lie back in southeast Lebanon, in a secret encampment to which Bourne and Rebeka escaped following a firefight weeks ago. The complex trail links to the mission given to Treadstone directors Peter Marks and Soraya Moore: find the semi-mythic terrorist assassin known as Nicodemo. In the course of Bourne's desperate, deadly search for a secret that will alter the future of the entire world, he will experience both triumph and loss, and his life will never be the same. Now everything turns on the amnesiac. Bourne must learn his identity and purpose before both he and Rebeka are killed. From [[Stockholm]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], from [[Mexico City]] to [[Beijing]], the web of lies and betrayals extends into a worldwide conspiracy of monumental proportions.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Retribution'' (2013) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Retribution}}\n\nThe eleventh book in the series was published on December 3, 2013.

The TV movie was largely faithful to Robert Ludlum's novel, both in plot as well as in the portrayal of the character of Jason Bourne.\n\nA spin-off of the Universal-produced film franchise entitled ''[[Treadstone]]'' began airing in October 2019 on [[USA Network]]. It explores the origins of the Treadstone program and operatives other than Bourne. Producer Ben Smith, who worked on the recent two ''Bourne'' films, said the show will tie into the next film in the franchise.<ref>https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481543/another-bourne-movie-is-in-the-works-and-itll-tie-into-the-treadstone-tv-show</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\n{{Main|Bourne (film series)}}\n[[File:Matt Damon TIFF 2015.jpg|thumb|Actor Matt Damon, who portrays Jason Bourne in the film series]]\nThe Jason Bourne novels were adapted into a series of films \u2013 ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (2002), ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' (2004), ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007), ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]'' (2012), and ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'' (2016). The films retain the titles and some base elements but otherwise feature different plots independent of the novels. In these films, Bourne is portrayed by [[Matt Damon]].\n\nBourne does not appear in ''The Bourne Legacy'', with the exception of his picture being featured in the film as well as brief discussions of how he's caused problems to the organization he worked for. As  a result, the film focuses on the fallout in the intelligence community from Bourne's actions in ''Ultimatum''. ''Legacy'' features [[Jeremy Renner]] as Aaron Cross, an operative in a different clandestine program evolved from Treadstone.\n\n=== Video games ===\n\nA video game titled ''[[Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy]]'' was released in 2008 for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]].\n\nThe Ludlum estate obtained the rights to the video game franchise and sold it to [[Electronic Arts]] in 2009.

It was introduced in 1896 for [[Smith & Wesson]]'s first-model [[Hand Ejector]] revolver. [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] called it the '''.32 Colt New Police''' in revolvers it made chambered for the cartridge.<ref name=\"Barnes2009\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe .32 S&W Long was introduced in 1896 with the company's first hand ejector revolver. The .32 Long is simply a lengthened version of the earlier [[.32 S&W]]. The [[hand ejector]] design has evolved some, but with its swing out cylinder on a crane, has been the basis for every S&W revolver designed since. In 1896, the cartridge was loaded with black powder. In 1903 the small hand ejector was updated with a new design. The cartridge stayed the same, but was now loaded with smokeless powder to roughly the same chamber pressure.<ref name=\"Barnes2009\">{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Frank C.|title=Cartridges of the World: A Complete and Illustrated Reference for Over 1500 Cartridges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_-kUkNXTNwC&pg=PA284|year=2009|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1330-5|pages=283\u2013284}}</ref>\n\nWhen he was the [[New York City]] [[Police Commissioner]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]] standardized the department's use of the [[Colt New Police Revolver|Colt New Police]] revolver. The cartridge was then adopted by several other northeastern U.S. police departments.<ref>\"[http://www.gunblast.com/Cumpston_32Colt.htm .32 Colt Police Positive Special]\" by Mike Cumpston at GunBlast.com</ref> The .32 Long is well known as an unusually accurate cartridge. This reputation led Police Commissioner Roosevelt to select it as an expedient way to increase officers' accuracy with their revolvers in New York City. The Colt company referred to the .32 S&W Long cartridge as the .32 \"Colt's New Police\" cartridge, concurrent with the conversion of the Colt New Police revolver from .32 Long Colt. The cartridges are functionally identical with the exception that the .32 NP cartridge has been historically loaded with a flat nosed bullet as opposed to the round nose of the .32 S&W Long.<ref name=\"Barnes2009\"/>\n[[File:Ijcoltwiki.jpg|thumb|Above: Iver Johnson Safety Automatic* Below: Colt Police Positive -both chambered for .32 Smith and Wesson Long/ Colt New Police *Automatic refers to automatic, simultaneous ejection of cartridges and/or cases.]]\n\n==Current use==\nIn the United States, it is usually older revolvers which are chambered in this caliber. The cartridge has mostly fallen out of use due to smaller revolvers chambered in [[.38 Special]] being more effective for self-defense.<ref name=\"Barnes2009\"/> The cartridge is widely used internationally, particularly in countries, like India, that restrict the calibers available to civilian firearms owners.

The .32 Long is simply a lengthened version of the earlier [[.32 S&W]].

Even though it is commonly thought that Paul established a Gentile church, it took centuries for a complete break to manifest. Growing tensions led to a starker separation that was virtually complete by the time Jewish Christians refused to join in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Khokba Jewish revolt of 132]].<ref>Davidson, p. 146</ref> Certain events are perceived as pivotal in the growing rift between Christianity and Judaism.\n\nThe [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] and the consequent dispersion of Jews and Jewish Christians from the city (after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]) ended any pre-eminence of the Jewish-Christian leadership in Jerusalem. Early Christianity grew further apart from Judaism to establish itself as a predominantly Gentile religion, and [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] became the first Gentile Christian community with stature.<ref>Franzen, p. 25</ref>\n\nThe hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 85 is often stated to have condemned all who claimed the Messiah had already come, and Christianity in particular, excluding them from attending synagogue.<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

It is probable that the condemnation of Jamnia included many groups, of which the Christians were but one, and did not necessarily mean excommunication. That some of the later church fathers only recommended against [[synagogue]] attendance makes it improbable that an anti-Christian prayer was a common part of the synagogue liturgy. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries.<ref>Wylen (1995), p. 190.</ref><ref>Wright, pp. 164\u201365.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1st century, Judaism was a legal religion with the protection of [[Roman law]], worked out in compromise with the Roman state over two centuries (see [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire]] for details). In contrast, Christianity was not legalized until the 313 [[Edict of Milan]]. Observant Jews had special rights, including the privilege of abstaining from civic pagan rites. Christians were initially identified with the Jewish religion by the Romans, but as they became more distinct, Christianity became a problem for Roman rulers. Around the year 98, the emperor [[Nerva]] decreed that Christians did not have to pay the [[Fiscus Iudaicus|annual tax upon the Jews]], effectively recognizing them as distinct from [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. This opened the way to Christians being persecuted for disobedience to the emperor, as they refused to worship the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|state pantheon]].<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

For example, [[Pliny the Younger]] postulates that Christians are not Jews since they do not pay the tax, in his letters to [[Trajan]].<ref>Wylen, pp. 190\u201392.</ref><ref>Dunn, pp. 33\u201334.</ref>\n\n===Later rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. In Christian circles, ''[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]'' later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, generally holding the same beliefs except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\">Dauphin (1993). pp. 235, 240\u201342.</ref> The [[Ebionites]] may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. They were considered by Gentile Christians to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and Gentile converts. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, ''Ebionite'' was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp. 157\u201359.</ref>\n\nThere was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both Gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. The true end of ancient Jewish Christianity occurred only in the 5th century.{{sfn|Dunn|1991}} Gentile Christianity became the dominant strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\"/>{{refn|group=note|Jewish Virtual Library: \"A major difficulty in tracing the growth of Christianity from its beginnings as a [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic sect]], and its relations to the various other normative-Jewish, sectarian-Jewish, and Christian-Jewish groups is presented by the fact that what ultimately became normative Christianity was originally but one among various contending Christian trends. Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the Church, the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).

Much of the original church liturgical services functioned as a means of learning [[Christian theology]]. A final uniformity of liturgical services may have become solidified after the church established a [[Biblical canon]], possibly based on the [[Apostolic Constitutions]] and [[Clementine literature]]. [[Pope Clement I|Clement]] (d. 99) writes that [[liturgy|liturgies]] are \"to be celebrated, and not carelessly nor in disorder\" but the final uniformity of liturgical services only came later, though the ''[[Liturgy of St James]]'' is traditionally associated with James the Just.<ref>The traditional title is: [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.xii.ii.html ''The Divine Liturgy of James the Holy Apostle and Brother of the Lord''];  [[Ante-Nicene Fathers (book)|Ante-Nicene Fathers]] by [[Philip Schaff]] in the public domain</ref>\n\nBooks not accepted by Pauline Christianity are termed [[biblical apocrypha]], though the exact list varies from denomination to denomination.\n\n===Old Testament===\n{{Main|Development of the Old Testament canon}}\n\nThe [[Biblical canon]] began with the Jewish [[Scriptures]].

Even though it is commonly thought that Paul established a Gentile church, it took centuries for a complete break to manifest. Growing tensions led to a starker separation that was virtually complete by the time Jewish Christians refused to join in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Khokba Jewish revolt of 132]].<ref>Davidson, p. 146</ref> Certain events are perceived as pivotal in the growing rift between Christianity and Judaism.\n\nThe [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] and the consequent dispersion of Jews and Jewish Christians from the city (after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]) ended any pre-eminence of the Jewish-Christian leadership in Jerusalem. Early Christianity grew further apart from Judaism to establish itself as a predominantly Gentile religion, and [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] became the first Gentile Christian community with stature.<ref>Franzen, p. 25</ref>\n\nThe hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 85 is often stated to have condemned all who claimed the Messiah had already come, and Christianity in particular, excluding them from attending synagogue.<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

It is probable that the condemnation of Jamnia included many groups, of which the Christians were but one, and did not necessarily mean excommunication. That some of the later church fathers only recommended against [[synagogue]] attendance makes it improbable that an anti-Christian prayer was a common part of the synagogue liturgy. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries.<ref>Wylen (1995), p. 190.</ref><ref>Wright, pp. 164\u201365.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1st century, Judaism was a legal religion with the protection of [[Roman law]], worked out in compromise with the Roman state over two centuries (see [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire]] for details). In contrast, Christianity was not legalized until the 313 [[Edict of Milan]]. Observant Jews had special rights, including the privilege of abstaining from civic pagan rites. Christians were initially identified with the Jewish religion by the Romans, but as they became more distinct, Christianity became a problem for Roman rulers. Around the year 98, the emperor [[Nerva]] decreed that Christians did not have to pay the [[Fiscus Iudaicus|annual tax upon the Jews]], effectively recognizing them as distinct from [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. This opened the way to Christians being persecuted for disobedience to the emperor, as they refused to worship the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|state pantheon]].<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

For example, [[Pliny the Younger]] postulates that Christians are not Jews since they do not pay the tax, in his letters to [[Trajan]].<ref>Wylen, pp. 190\u201392.</ref><ref>Dunn, pp. 33\u201334.</ref>\n\n===Later rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. In Christian circles, ''[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]'' later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, generally holding the same beliefs except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\">Dauphin (1993). pp. 235, 240\u201342.</ref> The [[Ebionites]] may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership.

The true end of ancient Jewish Christianity occurred only in the 5th century.{{sfn|Dunn|1991}} Gentile Christianity became the dominant strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\"/>{{refn|group=note|Jewish Virtual Library: \"A major difficulty in tracing the growth of Christianity from its beginnings as a [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic sect]], and its relations to the various other normative-Jewish, sectarian-Jewish, and Christian-Jewish groups is presented by the fact that what ultimately became normative Christianity was originally but one among various contending Christian trends. Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the Church, the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).
