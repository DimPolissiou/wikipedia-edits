It is the 56th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. Directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], co-directed by [[Don Hall (filmmaker)|Don Hall]] and [[Chris Williams (director)|Chris Williams]], the film introduces [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana and features the voices of [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Rachel House (actress)|Rachel House]], [[Temuera Morrison]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Alan Tudyk]]. The film features songs written by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Te Vaka|Opetaia Foa'i]] and [[Mark Mancina]], and an orchestral score also composed by Mancina.\n\nThe film tells the story of [[Moana (Disney character)|Moana]], the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] village, who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a [[blight]] strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], a legendary [[demigod]], in the hope of returning the relic to Te Fiti and saving her people.\n\n''Moana'' was released theatrically in the United States on November 23, 2016 to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going towards its animation, music, and vocal performances. The film went on to gross over $690&nbsp;million worldwide. Along with ''[[Zootopia]]'', it marked the first time since 2002 that Walt Disney Animation Studios released two feature films in the same year.

Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

The film features songs written by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Te Vaka|Opetaia Foa'i]] and [[Mark Mancina]], and an orchestral score also composed by Mancina.\n\nThe film tells the story of [[Moana (Disney character)|Moana]], the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] village, who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a [[blight]] strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], a legendary [[demigod]], in the hope of returning the relic to Te Fiti and saving her people.\n\n''Moana'' was released theatrically in the United States on November 23, 2016 to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going towards its animation, music, and vocal performances.

Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

Note heart-shaped corona of individuals.\n}}\nRotifers have [[bilateral symmetry]] and a variety of different shapes. The body of a rotifer is divided into a head, trunk, and foot, and is typically somewhat cylindrical. There is a well-developed [[cuticle]], which may be thick and rigid, giving the animal a box-like shape, or flexible, giving the animal a worm-like shape; such rotifers are respectively called ''loricate'' and ''illoricate''. Rigid cuticles are often composed of multiple plates, and may bear spines, ridges, or other ornamentation. Their cuticle is nonchitinous and is formed from sclerotized proteins.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of rotifers is the presence of a [[cilia]]ted structure, called the ''corona'', on the head. In the more primitive species, this forms a simple ring of cilia around the mouth from which an additional band of cilia stretches over the back of the head. In the great majority of rotifers, however, this has evolved into a more complex structure.\n\nModifications to the basic plan of the corona include alteration of the cilia into bristles or large tufts, and either expansion or loss of the ciliated band around the head. In genera such as ''[[Collotheca]]'', the corona is modified to form a funnel surrounding the mouth. In many species, such as those in the genus ''[[Testudinella]]'', the cilia around the mouth have disappeared, leaving just two small circular bands on the head. In the [[bdelloid]]s, this plan is further modified, with the upper band splitting into two rotating wheels, raised up on a pedestal projecting from the upper surface of the head.<ref name=IZ>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 272\u2013286|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}</ref>\n\nThe trunk forms the major part of the body, and encloses most of the internal organs. The foot projects from the rear of the trunk, and is usually much narrower, giving the appearance of a tail. The cuticle over the foot often forms rings, making it appear segmented, although the internal structure is uniform. Many rotifers can retract the foot partially or wholly into the trunk. The foot ends in from one to four toes, which, in sessile and crawling species, contain adhesive glands to attach the animal to the substratum. In many free-swimming species, the foot as a whole is reduced in size, and may even be absent.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Digestive system===\n[[File:Bdelloid.JPG|thumb|right|Scanning electron micrographs showing morphological variation of bdelloid rotifers and their jaws.]]\nThe coronal cilia create a current that sweeps food into the mouth. The mouth opens into a characteristic chewing [[pharynx]] (called the ''mastax''), sometimes via a ciliated tube, and sometimes directly. The pharynx has a powerful muscular wall and contains tiny, calcified, jaw-like structures called ''trophi'', which are the only fossilizable parts of a rotifer. The shape of the trophi varies between different species, depending partly on the nature of their diet. In suspension feeders, the trophi are covered in grinding ridges, while in more actively carnivorous species, they may be shaped like [[forceps]] to help bite into prey. In some [[ectoparasite|ectoparasitic]] rotifers, the mastax is adapted to grip onto the host, although, in others, the foot performs this function instead.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nBehind the mastax lies an [[oesophagus]], which opens into a [[stomach]] where most of the digestion and absorption occurs. The stomach opens into a short [[intestine]] that terminates in a [[cloaca]] on the posterior dorsal surface of the animal. Up to seven [[salivary gland]]s are present in some species, emptying to the mouth in front of the oesophagus, while the stomach is associated with two gastric glands that produce [[digestive enzyme]]s.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nA pair of [[protonephridium|protonephridia]] open into a bladder that drains into the cloaca. These organs expel water from the body, helping to maintain [[osmoregulation|osmotic balance]].<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Nervous system===\nRotifers have a small brain, located just above the mastax, from which a number of nerves extend throughout the body. The number of nerves varies among species, although the nervous system usually has a simple layout. Close to the brain lies a ''retrocerebral organ'', consisting of two glands either side of a medial sac. The sac drains into a duct that divides into two before opening through pores on the uppermost part of the head. The function of the retrocerebral organ is unclear.<ref name=IZ/><ref name=\"wallace\">\nRobert Lee Wallace.\n[https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/42/3/660/724027/Rotifers-Exquisite-Metazoans1 \"Rotifers: Exquisite Metazoans\"].\n2002.\n{{doi | 10.1093/icb/42.3.660 }}\nquote:\n\"What is the function of the retrocerebral organ?\"\n</ref>\n\nThe nervous system comprises about 25% of the roughly 1,000 cells in a rotifer.<ref name=\"wallace\" />\n\nRotifers typically possess one or two pairs of short [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] and up to five eyes. The eyes are simple in structure, sometimes with just a single [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] [[Photoreceptor cell|cell]].

Each is different and found on a different chromosome excluding the possibility of [[homozygous]] [[sexual reproduction]].\n\n==Feeding==\n[[File:Movie of Rotifer, feeding (probably of the genus Cephalodella).theora.ogv|thumb|Video of rotifer feeding, probably of the genus ''[[Cephalodella]]'']]\n[[File:Feeding rotifer.ogv|thumb|Video of a [[bdelloid]] rotifer feeding]]\nRotifers eat particulate organic detritus, dead bacteria, algae, and protozoans. They eat particles up to 10 micrometres in size. Like [[crustacean]]s, rotifers contribute to nutrient recycling. For this reason, they are used in fish tanks to help clean the water, to prevent clouds of waste matter. Rotifers affect the species composition of algae in ecosystems through their choice in grazing. Rotifers may be in competition with [[cladocera]] and [[copepod]]s for [[plankton]]ic food sources.\n\n==Reproduction and life cycle==\nRotifers are [[dioecious]] and reproduce sexually or [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetically]]. They are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], with the females always being larger than the males. In some species, this is relatively mild, but in others the female may be up to ten times the size of the male. In parthenogenetic species, males may be present only at certain times of the year, or absent altogether.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe female reproductive system consists of one or two [[ovary|ovaries]], each with a ''[[vitellarium]]'' gland that supplies the eggs with [[yolk]]. Together, each ovary and vitellarium form a single [[syncitium|syncitial]] structure in the anterior part of the animal, opening through an [[oviduct]] into the [[cloaca]].<ref name=IZ/>\n\nMales do not usually have a functional digestive system, and are therefore short-lived, often being [[sexually fertile]] at birth. They have a single [[testicle]] and [[sperm duct]], associated with a pair of glandular structures referred to as ''[[prostate]]s'' (unrelated to the vertebrate prostate). The sperm duct opens into a gonopore at the posterior end of the animal, which is usually modified to form a [[penis]]. The gonopore is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the cloaca of females, but in most species has no connection to the vestigial digestive system, which lacks an [[anus]].<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe phylum Rotifera encloses three classes that reproduce by three different mechanisms: Seisonidea only reproduce sexually; Bdelloidea reproduce exclusively by asexual parthenogenesis; Monogononta reproduce alternating these two mechanisms (\"cyclical parthenogenesis\" or \"heterogony\").<ref name=\"Nogrady, T. 1993\">Nogrady, T., Wallace, R.L., Snell, T.W., 1993. Rotifera vol.1: biology, ecology and\nsystematics. Guides to the identification of the microinvertebrates of the continental\nwaters of the world 4. SPB Academic Publishing bv, The Hague.</ref> Parthenogenesis (amictic phase) dominates the monogonont life cycle, promoting fast population growth and colonization. In this phase males are absent and amictic females produce diploid eggs by mitosis which develop parthenogenetically into females that are clones of their mothers.<ref name=\"Nogrady, T. 1993\"/> Some amictic females can generate mictic females that will produce haploid eggs by meiosis. Mixis (meiosis) is induced by different types of stimulus depending on species. Haploid eggs develop into haploid dwarf males if they are not fertilized and into diploid \u201cresting eggs\u201d (or \u201cdiapausing eggs\u201d) if they are fertilized by males.\n\nFertilization is internal. The male either inserts his penis into the female's cloaca or uses it to penetrate her skin, injecting the sperm into the body cavity. The egg secretes a shell, and is attached either to the substratum, nearby plants, or the female's own body. A few species, such as members of the ''[[Rotaria]]'', are [[ovoviviparous]], retaining the eggs inside their body until they hatch.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nMost species hatch as miniature versions of the adult. Sessile species, however, are born as free-swimming [[larva]]e, which closely resemble the adults of related free-swimming species. Females grow rapidly, reaching their adult size within a few days, while males typically do not grow in size at all.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe life span of [[Monogononta|monogonont]] females varies from two days to about three weeks.\n\n===Loss of sexual reproduction system===\n'''\u2018Ancient asexuals\u2019:''' [[Bdelloid]] rotifers are assumed to have reproduced without sex for many millions of years. Males are absent within the species, and females reproduce only by [[parthenogenesis]].\n\n'''Recent transitions:''' Loss of [[sexual reproduction]] can be inherited in a simple [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]]ian fashion in the monogonont rotifer ''[[Brachionus calyciflorus]]'': This species can normally switch between sexual and asexual reproduction (cyclical parthenogenesis), but occasionally gives rise to purely asexual lineages (obligate parthenogens).

This facility is termed [[anhydrobiosis]], and organisms with these capabilities are termed anhydrobionts. Under drought conditions, bdelloid rotifers contract into an inert form and lose almost all body water; when rehydrated they resume activity within a few hours. Bdelloids can survive the dry state for long periods, with the longest well-documented dormancy being nine years. While in other anhydrobionts, such as the [[brine shrimp]], this desiccation tolerance is thought to be linked to the production of [[trehalose]], a non-reducing disaccharide ([[sugar]]), bdelloids apparently cannot synthesise trehalose. In bdelloids, a major cause of the resistance to desiccation, as well as resistance to ionizing radiation, is a highly efficient mechanism for repairing the DNA double-strand breaks induced by these agents.<ref name=\"pmid25105197\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hespeels B, Knapen M, Hanot-Mambres D, Heuskin AC, Pineux F, LUCAS S, Koszul R, Van Doninck K |title=Gateway to genetic exchange?

Note heart-shaped corona of individuals.\n}}\nRotifers have [[bilateral symmetry]] and a variety of different shapes. The body of a rotifer is divided into a head, trunk, and foot, and is typically somewhat cylindrical. There is a well-developed [[cuticle]], which may be thick and rigid, giving the animal a box-like shape, or flexible, giving the animal a worm-like shape; such rotifers are respectively called ''loricate'' and ''illoricate''. Rigid cuticles are often composed of multiple plates, and may bear spines, ridges, or other ornamentation. Their cuticle is nonchitinous and is formed from sclerotized proteins.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of rotifers is the presence of a [[cilia]]ted structure, called the ''corona'', on the head. In the more primitive species, this forms a simple ring of cilia around the mouth from which an additional band of cilia stretches over the back of the head. In the great majority of rotifers, however, this has evolved into a more complex structure.\n\nModifications to the basic plan of the corona include alteration of the cilia into bristles or large tufts, and either expansion or loss of the ciliated band around the head. In genera such as ''[[Collotheca]]'', the corona is modified to form a funnel surrounding the mouth. In many species, such as those in the genus ''[[Testudinella]]'', the cilia around the mouth have disappeared, leaving just two small circular bands on the head. In the [[bdelloid]]s, this plan is further modified, with the upper band splitting into two rotating wheels, raised up on a pedestal projecting from the upper surface of the head.<ref name=IZ>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 272\u2013286|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}</ref>\n\nThe trunk forms the major part of the body, and encloses most of the internal organs. The foot projects from the rear of the trunk, and is usually much narrower, giving the appearance of a tail. The cuticle over the foot often forms rings, making it appear segmented, although the internal structure is uniform. Many rotifers can retract the foot partially or wholly into the trunk. The foot ends in from one to four toes, which, in sessile and crawling species, contain adhesive glands to attach the animal to the substratum. In many free-swimming species, the foot as a whole is reduced in size, and may even be absent.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Digestive system===\n[[File:Bdelloid.JPG|thumb|right|Scanning electron micrographs showing morphological variation of bdelloid rotifers and their jaws.]]\nThe coronal cilia create a current that sweeps food into the mouth. The mouth opens into a characteristic chewing [[pharynx]] (called the ''mastax''), sometimes via a ciliated tube, and sometimes directly. The pharynx has a powerful muscular wall and contains tiny, calcified, jaw-like structures called ''trophi'', which are the only fossilizable parts of a rotifer. The shape of the trophi varies between different species, depending partly on the nature of their diet. In suspension feeders, the trophi are covered in grinding ridges, while in more actively carnivorous species, they may be shaped like [[forceps]] to help bite into prey. In some [[ectoparasite|ectoparasitic]] rotifers, the mastax is adapted to grip onto the host, although, in others, the foot performs this function instead.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nBehind the mastax lies an [[oesophagus]], which opens into a [[stomach]] where most of the digestion and absorption occurs. The stomach opens into a short [[intestine]] that terminates in a [[cloaca]] on the posterior dorsal surface of the animal. Up to seven [[salivary gland]]s are present in some species, emptying to the mouth in front of the oesophagus, while the stomach is associated with two gastric glands that produce [[digestive enzyme]]s.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nA pair of [[protonephridium|protonephridia]] open into a bladder that drains into the cloaca. These organs expel water from the body, helping to maintain [[osmoregulation|osmotic balance]].<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Nervous system===\nRotifers have a small brain, located just above the mastax, from which a number of nerves extend throughout the body. The number of nerves varies among species, although the nervous system usually has a simple layout. Close to the brain lies a ''retrocerebral organ'', consisting of two glands either side of a medial sac. The sac drains into a duct that divides into two before opening through pores on the uppermost part of the head. The function of the retrocerebral organ is unclear.<ref name=IZ/><ref name=\"wallace\">\nRobert Lee Wallace.\n[https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/42/3/660/724027/Rotifers-Exquisite-Metazoans1 \"Rotifers: Exquisite Metazoans\"].\n2002.\n{{doi | 10.1093/icb/42.3.660 }}\nquote:\n\"What is the function of the retrocerebral organ?\"\n</ref>\n\nThe nervous system comprises about 25% of the roughly 1,000 cells in a rotifer.<ref name=\"wallace\" />\n\nRotifers typically possess one or two pairs of short [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] and up to five eyes. The eyes are simple in structure, sometimes with just a single [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] [[Photoreceptor cell|cell]].

They eat particles up to 10 micrometres in size. Like [[crustacean]]s, rotifers contribute to nutrient recycling. For this reason, they are used in fish tanks to help clean the water, to prevent clouds of waste matter. Rotifers affect the species composition of algae in ecosystems through their choice in grazing. Rotifers may be in competition with [[cladocera]] and [[copepod]]s for [[plankton]]ic food sources.\n\n==Reproduction and life cycle==\nRotifers are [[dioecious]] and reproduce sexually or [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetically]]. They are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], with the females always being larger than the males. In some species, this is relatively mild, but in others the female may be up to ten times the size of the male. In parthenogenetic species, males may be present only at certain times of the year, or absent altogether.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe female reproductive system consists of one or two [[ovary|ovaries]], each with a ''[[vitellarium]]'' gland that supplies the eggs with [[yolk]]. Together, each ovary and vitellarium form a single [[syncitium|syncitial]] structure in the anterior part of the animal, opening through an [[oviduct]] into the [[cloaca]].<ref name=IZ/>\n\nMales do not usually have a functional digestive system, and are therefore short-lived, often being [[sexually fertile]] at birth. They have a single [[testicle]] and [[sperm duct]], associated with a pair of glandular structures referred to as ''[[prostate]]s'' (unrelated to the vertebrate prostate). The sperm duct opens into a gonopore at the posterior end of the animal, which is usually modified to form a [[penis]]. The gonopore is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the cloaca of females, but in most species has no connection to the vestigial digestive system, which lacks an [[anus]].<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe phylum Rotifera encloses three classes that reproduce by three different mechanisms: Seisonidea only reproduce sexually; Bdelloidea reproduce exclusively by asexual parthenogenesis; Monogononta reproduce alternating these two mechanisms (\"cyclical parthenogenesis\" or \"heterogony\").<ref name=\"Nogrady, T. 1993\">Nogrady, T., Wallace, R.L., Snell, T.W., 1993. Rotifera vol.1: biology, ecology and\nsystematics. Guides to the identification of the microinvertebrates of the continental\nwaters of the world 4. SPB Academic Publishing bv, The Hague.</ref> Parthenogenesis (amictic phase) dominates the monogonont life cycle, promoting fast population growth and colonization. In this phase males are absent and amictic females produce diploid eggs by mitosis which develop parthenogenetically into females that are clones of their mothers.<ref name=\"Nogrady, T. 1993\"/> Some amictic females can generate mictic females that will produce haploid eggs by meiosis. Mixis (meiosis) is induced by different types of stimulus depending on species. Haploid eggs develop into haploid dwarf males if they are not fertilized and into diploid \u201cresting eggs\u201d (or \u201cdiapausing eggs\u201d) if they are fertilized by males.\n\nFertilization is internal. The male either inserts his penis into the female's cloaca or uses it to penetrate her skin, injecting the sperm into the body cavity. The egg secretes a shell, and is attached either to the substratum, nearby plants, or the female's own body. A few species, such as members of the ''[[Rotaria]]'', are [[ovoviviparous]], retaining the eggs inside their body until they hatch.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nMost species hatch as miniature versions of the adult. Sessile species, however, are born as free-swimming [[larva]]e, which closely resemble the adults of related free-swimming species. Females grow rapidly, reaching their adult size within a few days, while males typically do not grow in size at all.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe life span of [[Monogononta|monogonont]] females varies from two days to about three weeks.\n\n===Loss of sexual reproduction system===\n'''\u2018Ancient asexuals\u2019:''' [[Bdelloid]] rotifers are assumed to have reproduced without sex for many millions of years. Males are absent within the species, and females reproduce only by [[parthenogenesis]].\n\n'''Recent transitions:''' Loss of [[sexual reproduction]] can be inherited in a simple [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]]ian fashion in the monogonont rotifer ''[[Brachionus calyciflorus]]'': This species can normally switch between sexual and asexual reproduction (cyclical parthenogenesis), but occasionally gives rise to purely asexual lineages (obligate parthenogens).

This facility is termed [[anhydrobiosis]], and organisms with these capabilities are termed anhydrobionts. Under drought conditions, bdelloid rotifers contract into an inert form and lose almost all body water; when rehydrated they resume activity within a few hours. Bdelloids can survive the dry state for long periods, with the longest well-documented dormancy being nine years. While in other anhydrobionts, such as the [[brine shrimp]], this desiccation tolerance is thought to be linked to the production of [[trehalose]], a non-reducing disaccharide ([[sugar]]), bdelloids apparently cannot synthesise trehalose.

A very strong low pressure system developed across the central part of North America and was associated with a long [[cold front]]. Ahead of the storm, the warm moist air generated from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] increased the likelihood for a significant weather event. On April 15, activity developed across the Mid-Mississippi Valley and southern [[Ohio Valley]] where several tornadoes touched down in Illinois starting in the late afternoon before moving into Arkansas during the overnight hours where the first fatalities were reported.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nOn April 16, as the main low-pressure system was near the [[Great Lakes]] and its cold front crossing the [[Mississippi River]], [[dew point]]s reached the mid to upper 60s across the [[Tennessee Valley]] while later in the day, [[Convective available potential energy|CAPE values]] reached 1600 J/kg while dry air intrusion was also on the rise increasing the threat of severe weather across the area.

On that day, 13 tornadoes swept through [[Middle Tennessee]]&mdash;two of them touching down in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], causing significant damage to the downtown and [[East Nashville]] areas.

A very strong low pressure system developed across the central part of North America and was associated with a long [[cold front]]. Ahead of the storm, the warm moist air generated from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] increased the likelihood for a significant weather event. On April 15, activity developed across the Mid-Mississippi Valley and southern [[Ohio Valley]] where several tornadoes touched down in Illinois starting in the late afternoon before moving into Arkansas during the overnight hours where the first fatalities were reported.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nOn April 16, as the main low-pressure system was near the [[Great Lakes]] and its cold front crossing the [[Mississippi River]], [[dew point]]s reached the mid to upper 60s across the [[Tennessee Valley]] while later in the day, [[Convective available potential energy|CAPE values]] reached 1600 J/kg while dry air intrusion was also on the rise increasing the threat of severe weather across the area.

Her father was close to retirement and probably too old to have been conscripted into the [[Wehrmacht|army]].   He worked as a [[Veterinarian|vet]].   From him she inherited a love for animals which she has sustained ever since.   The more decisive influence came from her mother and maternal grandmother who shared the house, making the family home one in which three generations of women lived together.   The family's [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Protestant faith]] was an important aspect of family life, but it was practiced without dogmatism.   As a teenager she attended a girls' \"evangelical circle\", while quietly nurturing an ambition to become a sports teacher when she grew up.<ref name=HLiGmKHS/><ref name=HLlautJB>{{cite web|title=Zur Buh-Frau gemacht: Die Tagungsleiterin Herta Leistner|author=Juliane Brumberg |url= http://www.bzw-weiterdenken.de/2018/12/zur-buh-frau-gemacht-die-tagungsleiterin-herta-leistner/|work= beziehungsweise \u2013 weiterdenken|publisher=Christel G\u00f6ttert, R\u00fcsselsheim|date=14 December 2018|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Childhood bereavement ===\nEverything changed when her mother committed suicide.   She was now sixteen and there was no longer any question of completing her school career to the point at which she would pass the [[Abitur]] exam which would have been necessary to progress to any sort of teacher training college or other university level educational institution.   The suicide had come shortly after the death of her grandmother, and now it was down to Herta to look after her bereaved father and brother while at the same time running the house.<ref name=HLlautUH/>   However, approximately a year later her aunt moved in and took over the household duties.   Herta Leistner was now able to move away to [[Stuttgart]] where she spent an unpaid \"diaconal year\" at the \"Evangelische Diakonissenanstalt\" (''loosely, \"Evangelical Deaconess Institution\"'') where she undertook a training as a \"Gemeindehelferin\" (''loosely, \"parish assistant\"'').<ref name=HLlautJB/>   During her Stuttgart year she developed a deep attachment for a deaconess.

The matter had been ventilated:  there was sign of any wider wish to discuss it, but somehow it was now becoming among one among the various unspoken assumptions underpinning the women's discussions.<ref name=HLlautUH/>   In 1983 it nevertheless became apparent that there were a number of women, of whom Hrta Leistner was one, who were not content to leave things to rest there indefinitely.<ref name=HLlautUH/>   That year Leistner and a few fellow campaigners drafted up a message, \"Are there any lesbian women in the church at all?   If so, get in touch!\"{{efn \"Gibt es \u00fcberhaupt lesbische Frauen in der Kirche? Wenn ja, so meldet euch doch!\"<ref name=HLlautUH/>}}   The message was distributed provately, but then also printed in feminist publications.   The response began as a trickle, but in the end around 300 responded.   In 1985 the first congress of lesbian church women was held at the [[:de:Arnoldshain |Arnoldshain]] [[Evangelical Academy]] faculity.  Subsequent congresses all took place at [[Bad Boll]].   Even at the first of them, the number of participants was unexpectedly large even though the programme spelled out nothing about lesbians and \"advance publicity\" was restricted to word of mouth and programmes passed by hand.   Many of those attending were worried about losing their jobs.   The information distributed ahead of the Arnoldshain congress was framed [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|elliptically]], under the heading \"Lebensformen\" (''\"Lifestyles\"'') and set out topics for discussion sich as \"How do single women live alone?\", \"What problems do divorced women have?\" and indeed \"How do women live together?\"<ref name=HLlautJB/>\n\n=== Coming out ===\nThe subterfuge ended in 1987.<ref name=HLiGmKHS/>   That was the year of publication for the book \"H\u00e4ttest du gedacht, dass wir so viele sind?

[[Herta Leistner]].   The authors of the main texts were identified in a subtitle simply as \"[the] sanften Verschw\u00f6rerinnen\" (''\"[the] gentle conspirators\"''):  most had chosen to remain anonymous.   They included deaconesess, women pastors, women theologians, women teachers and other women with important links to the evangelical churches.   For the avoidance of any residual doubt, Herta Leister now also took the opportunity to [[Coming out|\"come out\"]].<ref name=HLiGmKHS/><ref name=HLlautUH/><ref name=HLlautJB/>\n\nBoth in positive ways and in negative ones, the book proved a milstone:  it profoundly consequential for lesbian women.  For Leistner personally there were ways in  which life became ten timesd easier.  \"We no longer had to keep anything under cover, and so many good conversations followed\". {{efn |\"Danach war das Leben zehnmal leichter. Wir mussten nichts mehr unter dem Deckel halten und haben so viele gute Gespr\u00e4che gef\u00fchrt....\"<ref name=HLlautJB/>}}    Leistner was also very clear that without the strengthening experiences of the previous few years, and without the intellectual underpionnings of feminist theologiy, that book would never have happened.  \"Only through that did we find the courage to go ahead.  And we wanted to counter the extraordinarily powerful inner pressure to see lesbian women as sinful women\".<ref name=HLlautJB/>{{efn |Nur dadurch hatten wir den Mut dazu. Und wir wollten dem au\u00dferordentlichen inneren Druck, als lesbische Frauen S\u00fcnderinnen zu sein, etwas entgegensetzen.<ref name=HLlautJB/>}}   The book met with widespread approval and opened doors to a more open approach to dealing with a range of life issues.   But there was also a powerful tide of opposition.   Some of the most shrill expressions of shock and hostility came from churchmen and churchwomen inside the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|evangelical churches]], and especially from the churches' evangelical wings which had always been strongly represented in the W\u00fcrttemberg synod and church hierarchy more generally.<ref name=HLiGmKHS/><ref name=HLlautJB/>\n\n=== Reaction ===\nThere was discussion within the churches of launching a disciplinary process against Leistner, citing the legalistic grounds that her name and address were included in the book as a potential contact point for lesbian women.   Many of the attacks became intensely personal    Leistner was subjected to a \"inquisition\" by clerical interrogators who acused her of turning the  [[Bad Boll]] [[:de:Evangelische Akademie Bad Boll| College]] into a \"Temple of lesbian love\" (''\"Tempel der lesbischen Liebe\"'').   They alleged that the \"lesbian conferences\" were simply a device on the part of Herta Listner whereby she might find more lesbian friends for herself.   And they demanded that lesbian and feminist themes be expunged from synod and conference programmes.<ref name=HLiGmKHS/><ref name=HLlautUH/><ref name=HLlautJB/>\n\n<!---\n\nKarl-Heinz Steinle\n\nHerta Leistner blieb standhaft: sie setzte ihre Arbeit fort und konnte die ebenfalls geforderten Streichung der lesbischen und feministischen Themen aus dem Tagungsprogramm abwenden.\n\nTrotz aller Attacken hielt Herta Leistner an ihrer \u00dcberzeugung fest, dass Ver\u00e4nderung innerhalb der Institution Kirche m\u00f6glich sind. 1993 \u00fcbernahm sie die Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung des Frauenstudien- und -bildungszentrums der Evangelischen Kirche in Gelnhausen, dessen Einrichtung sie selbst mit vorangetrieben hatte. Im gleichen Jahr promovierte sie an der Universit\u00e4t Hannover mit der Arbeit \u201cAus der Nichtexistenz auftauchen\u2026 Der Beitrag der Tagungsarbeit zum Identit\u00e4tsbildungsprozess lesbischer Frauen in der Kirche\u201c.\n\nF\u00fcr ihre \u201cVerdienste um die Wahrnehmung und Emanzipation lesbischer Frauen in Kirche und Gesellschaft\u201d bekam Herta Leistner 1996 das Bundesverdienstkreuz verliehen. Auch diese Ehrung wurde von Protesten einzelner Kirchenvertreter und evangelikaler Gruppen begleitet. Diesen entgegnete die Offene Kirche von W\u00fcrttemberg 2009 mit der Verleihung ihres AMOS-Preises f\u00fcr Zivilcourage in Kirche und Gesellschaft an Herta Leistner.\n\nUlrike H\n\nDie Themen bleiben, Herta Leistner bleibt. \u201cEigentlich\u201d, beteuert sie, \u201cbin ich eher harmoniegepr\u00e4gt, aber ich lasse mir meinen Glauben und meine Lebensweise nicht absprechen. Da bin ich stur wie ein Panzer.\u201d Zum Gl\u00fcck. Denn Bad Boll ist nur ein Vorgeschmack auf sp\u00e4tere Attacken. Nach langen Verhandlungen hat eine Initiativgruppe \u201cFrauenakademie\u201d die EKD soweit, ein eigenes Frauenstudien- und Bildungszentrum einzurichten: als praktischer Beitrag zur \u201cFrauen-Dekade\u201d. 1993 beginnt der Aufbau des Anna-Paulsen-Hauses - und gleichzeitig eine beispiellose Hetze, angef\u00fchrt von evangelikalen Kreisen und deren Mediendienst \u201cidea\u201d. Sie richtet sich gegen \u201cKr\u00e4fte der Irrlehre\u201d, gegen \u201cExtrem-Feministinnen\u201d, weil sie die heilige Ehe bedrohten, weil sie \u201clesbische Partnerschaften\u201d gleichstellen wollten, die \u201cGruppensex\u201d propagierten, weil sie Lebenspartnerschaften auch zwischen mehr als zwei Frauen oder M\u00e4nnern f\u00fcr segensw\u00fcrdig hielten, weil sie den Tod Jesu als \u201csadomasochistisch\u201d verh\u00f6hnten, kurz: weil sie die S\u00fcnde in die Kirche tr\u00fcgen. Es fehlt nur noch der Ruf nach dem Scheiterhaufen.\n\nDie Hetze richtet sich vor allem gegen Herta Leistner, die als eine der beiden Studienleiterinnen des neuen Zentrums eingestellt worden ist. 12.000 Unterschriften sammeln evangelikale Gruppen gegen ihre Berufung. Sie fordern von der EKD, die Personalentscheidung r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig zu machen, verlieren aber den internen Machtkampf. Doch als im Sommer 1994 das Anna-Paulsen-Haus feierlich eingeweiht wird, versammeln sich 150 DemonstrantInnen am Rande des Festaktes mit Spruchb\u00e4ndern wie \u201cFrauenzentrum oder Hexenkessel?\u201d\n\nJuliane B\n\n\u201eDie Evangelikalen, die in W\u00fcrttemberg stark vertreten sind, haben mich und meine Lebensform herausgepickt, um die Akademie in Bad Boll, die ihnen mit ihren fortschrittlichen Themen schon immer ein Dorn im Auge war, anzugreifen.

Evangelikale Gruppen sammelten Unterschriften und organisierten eine unglaublich h\u00e4ssliche Kampagne mit einem \u201aBitt- und Bu\u00dfgottesdienst\u2018.

Her father was close to retirement and probably too old to have been conscripted into the [[Wehrmacht|army]].   He worked as a [[Veterinarian|vet]].   From him she inherited a love for animals which she has sustained ever since.   The more decisive influence came from her mother and maternal grandmother who shared the house, making the family home one in which three generations of women lived together.   The family's [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Protestant faith]] was an important aspect of family life, but it was practiced without dogmatism.   As a teenager she attended a girls' \"evangelical circle\", while quietly nurturing an ambition to become a sports teacher when she grew up.<ref name=HLiGmKHS/><ref name=HLlautJB>{{cite web|title=Zur Buh-Frau gemacht: Die Tagungsleiterin Herta Leistner|author=Juliane Brumberg |url= http://www.bzw-weiterdenken.de/2018/12/zur-buh-frau-gemacht-die-tagungsleiterin-herta-leistner/|work= beziehungsweise \u2013 weiterdenken|publisher=Christel G\u00f6ttert, R\u00fcsselsheim|date=14 December 2018|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Childhood bereavement ===\nEverything changed when her mother committed suicide.   She was now sixteen and there was no longer any question of completing her school career to the point at which she would pass the [[Abitur]] exam which would have been necessary to progress to any sort of teacher training college or other university level educational institution.   The suicide had come shortly after the death of her grandmother, and now it was down to Herta to look after her bereaved father and brother while at the same time running the house.<ref name=HLlautUH/>   However, approximately a year later her aunt moved in and took over the household duties.   Herta Leistner was now able to move away to [[Stuttgart]] where she spent an unpaid \"diaconal year\" at the \"Evangelische Diakonissenanstalt\" (''loosely, \"Evangelical Deaconess Institution\"'') where she undertook a training as a \"Gemeindehelferin\" (''loosely, \"parish assistant\"'').<ref name=HLlautJB/>   During her Stuttgart year she developed a deep attachment for a deaconess.   The sisters made their disapproval clear \"although there was absolutely nothing going on\".   Leistner was unsettled by these reactions.   She sensed that she was \"different\", recalling that even at school she had developed a crush on a (female) teacher; while all her contemporaries were chattering excitedly about the boys.

The matter had been ventilated:  there was sign of any wider wish to discuss it, but somehow it was now becoming among one among the various unspoken assumptions underpinning the women's discussions.<ref name=HLlautUH/>   In 1983 it nevertheless became apparent that there were a number of women, of whom Hrta Leistner was one, who were not content to leave things to rest there indefinitely.<ref name=HLlautUH/>   That year Leistner and a few fellow campaigners drafted up a message, \"Are there any lesbian women in the church at all?   If so, get in touch!\"{{efn \"Gibt es \u00fcberhaupt lesbische Frauen in der Kirche? Wenn ja, so meldet euch doch!\"<ref name=HLlautUH/>}}   The message was distributed provately, but then also printed in feminist publications.   The response began as a trickle, but in the end around 300 responded.   In 1985 the first congress of lesbian church women was held at the [[:de:Arnoldshain |Arnoldshain]] [[Evangelical Academy]] faculity.  Subsequent congresses all took place at [[Bad Boll]].   Even at the first of them, the number of participants was unexpectedly large even though the programme spelled out nothing about lesbians and \"advance publicity\" was restricted to word of mouth and programmes passed by hand.   Many of those attending were worried about losing their jobs.   The information distributed ahead of the Arnoldshain congress was framed [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|elliptically]], under the heading \"Lebensformen\" (''\"Lifestyles\"'') and set out topics for discussion sich as \"How do single women live alone?\", \"What problems do divorced women have?\" and indeed \"How do women live together?\"<ref name=HLlautJB/>\n\n=== Coming out ===\nThe subterfuge ended in 1987.<ref name=HLiGmKHS/>   That was the year of publication for the book \"H\u00e4ttest du gedacht, dass wir so viele sind? Lesbische Frauen in der Kirche\" (''\"Would you have thought that there were so many of us?  Lesbian women in the church\"'').<ref name=Haettestgedacht>{{cite web|title=\"H\u00e4ttest du gedacht, dass wir so viele sind?\"|work=\"Seit 25 Jahren treffen sich lesbische Frauen in der Evangelischen Akademie Bad Boll in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg....\"|date= 18 December 2010 |author=Anne Kampf,  Journalistin und evangelische Theologin|url=https://www.evangelisch.de/inhalte/91383/18-12-2010/haettest-du-gedacht-dass-wir-so-viele-sind |publisher=Gemeinschaftswerks der Evangelischen Publizistik (GEP) gGmbH,  Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=11 April 2011}}</ref>   The book was compiled, edited and produced by [[Monika Barz]], [[Ute Wild]] and ... [[Herta Leistner]].   The authors of the main texts were identified in a subtitle simply as \"[the] sanften Verschw\u00f6rerinnen\" (''\"[the] gentle conspirators\"''):  most had chosen to remain anonymous.   They included deaconesess, women pastors, women theologians, women teachers and other women with important links to the evangelical churches.   For the avoidance of any residual doubt, Herta Leister now also took the opportunity to [[Coming out|\"come out\"]].<ref name=HLiGmKHS/><ref name=HLlautUH/><ref name=HLlautJB/>\n\nBoth in positive ways and in negative ones, the book proved a milstone:  it profoundly consequential for lesbian women.  For Leistner personally there were ways in  which life became ten timesd easier.  \"We no longer had to keep anything under cover, and so many good conversations followed\". {{efn |\"Danach war das Leben zehnmal leichter. Wir mussten nichts mehr unter dem Deckel halten und haben so viele gute Gespr\u00e4che gef\u00fchrt....\"<ref name=HLlautJB/>}}    Leistner was also very clear that without the strengthening experiences of the previous few years, and without the intellectual underpionnings of feminist theologiy, that book would never have happened.  \"Only through that did we find the courage to go ahead.  And we wanted to counter the extraordinarily powerful inner pressure to see lesbian women as sinful women\".<ref name=HLlautJB/>{{efn |Nur dadurch hatten wir den Mut dazu. Und wir wollten dem au\u00dferordentlichen inneren Druck, als lesbische Frauen S\u00fcnderinnen zu sein, etwas entgegensetzen.<ref name=HLlautJB/>}}   The book met with widespread approval and opened doors to a more open approach to dealing with a range of life issues.   But there was also a powerful tide of opposition.   Some of the most shrill expressions of shock and hostility came from churchmen and churchwomen inside the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|evangelical churches]], and especially from the churches' evangelical wings which had always been strongly represented in the W\u00fcrttemberg synod and church hierarchy more generally.<ref name=HLiGmKHS/><ref name=HLlautJB/>\n\n=== Reaction ===\nThere was discussion within the churches of launching a disciplinary process against Leistner, citing the legalistic grounds that her name and address were included in the book as a potential contact point for lesbian women.   Many of the attacks became intensely personal    Leistner was subjected to a \"inquisition\" by clerical interrogators who acused her of turning the  [[Bad Boll]] [[:de:Evangelische Akademie Bad Boll| College]] into a \"Temple of lesbian love\" (''\"Tempel der lesbischen Liebe\"'').   They alleged that the \"lesbian conferences\" were simply a device on the part of Herta Listner whereby she might find more lesbian friends for herself.   And they demanded that lesbian and feminist themes be expunged from synod and conference programmes.<ref name=HLiGmKHS/><ref name=HLlautUH/><ref name=HLlautJB/>\n\n<!---\n\nKarl-Heinz Steinle\n\nHerta Leistner blieb standhaft: sie setzte ihre Arbeit fort und konnte die ebenfalls geforderten Streichung der lesbischen und feministischen Themen aus dem Tagungsprogramm abwenden.\n\nTrotz aller Attacken hielt Herta Leistner an ihrer \u00dcberzeugung fest, dass Ver\u00e4nderung innerhalb der Institution Kirche m\u00f6glich sind. 1993 \u00fcbernahm sie die Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung des Frauenstudien- und -bildungszentrums der Evangelischen Kirche in Gelnhausen, dessen Einrichtung sie selbst mit vorangetrieben hatte. Im gleichen Jahr promovierte sie an der Universit\u00e4t Hannover mit der Arbeit \u201cAus der Nichtexistenz auftauchen\u2026 Der Beitrag der Tagungsarbeit zum Identit\u00e4tsbildungsprozess lesbischer Frauen in der Kirche\u201c.\n\nF\u00fcr ihre \u201cVerdienste um die Wahrnehmung und Emanzipation lesbischer Frauen in Kirche und Gesellschaft\u201d bekam Herta Leistner 1996 das Bundesverdienstkreuz verliehen. Auch diese Ehrung wurde von Protesten einzelner Kirchenvertreter und evangelikaler Gruppen begleitet. Diesen entgegnete die Offene Kirche von W\u00fcrttemberg 2009 mit der Verleihung ihres AMOS-Preises f\u00fcr Zivilcourage in Kirche und Gesellschaft an Herta Leistner.\n\nUlrike H\n\nDie Themen bleiben, Herta Leistner bleibt. \u201cEigentlich\u201d, beteuert sie, \u201cbin ich eher harmoniegepr\u00e4gt, aber ich lasse mir meinen Glauben und meine Lebensweise nicht absprechen. Da bin ich stur wie ein Panzer.\u201d Zum Gl\u00fcck. Denn Bad Boll ist nur ein Vorgeschmack auf sp\u00e4tere Attacken. Nach langen Verhandlungen hat eine Initiativgruppe \u201cFrauenakademie\u201d die EKD soweit, ein eigenes Frauenstudien- und Bildungszentrum einzurichten: als praktischer Beitrag zur \u201cFrauen-Dekade\u201d. 1993 beginnt der Aufbau des Anna-Paulsen-Hauses - und gleichzeitig eine beispiellose Hetze, angef\u00fchrt von evangelikalen Kreisen und deren Mediendienst \u201cidea\u201d. Sie richtet sich gegen \u201cKr\u00e4fte der Irrlehre\u201d, gegen \u201cExtrem-Feministinnen\u201d, weil sie die heilige Ehe bedrohten, weil sie \u201clesbische Partnerschaften\u201d gleichstellen wollten, die \u201cGruppensex\u201d propagierten, weil sie Lebenspartnerschaften auch zwischen mehr als zwei Frauen oder M\u00e4nnern f\u00fcr segensw\u00fcrdig hielten, weil sie den Tod Jesu als \u201csadomasochistisch\u201d verh\u00f6hnten, kurz: weil sie die S\u00fcnde in die Kirche tr\u00fcgen. Es fehlt nur noch der Ruf nach dem Scheiterhaufen.\n\nDie Hetze richtet sich vor allem gegen Herta Leistner, die als eine der beiden Studienleiterinnen des neuen Zentrums eingestellt worden ist. 12.000 Unterschriften sammeln evangelikale Gruppen gegen ihre Berufung. Sie fordern von der EKD, die Personalentscheidung r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig zu machen, verlieren aber den internen Machtkampf. Doch als im Sommer 1994 das Anna-Paulsen-Haus feierlich eingeweiht wird, versammeln sich 150 DemonstrantInnen am Rande des Festaktes mit Spruchb\u00e4ndern wie \u201cFrauenzentrum oder Hexenkessel?\u201d\n\nJuliane B\n\n\u201eDie Evangelikalen, die in W\u00fcrttemberg stark vertreten sind, haben mich und meine Lebensform herausgepickt, um die Akademie in Bad Boll, die ihnen mit ihren fortschrittlichen Themen schon immer ein Dorn im Auge war, anzugreifen. Ich wurde zur Buh-Frau gemacht!\u201c In der Landessynode gab es Kreise, die die Mittel f\u00fcr die Akademie ganz erheblich k\u00fcrzen wollten. Sie warfen Herta Leistner vor, aus der Akademie \u201eeinen Tempel der lesbischen Liebe\u201c gemacht zu haben und unterzogen sie w\u00e4hrend einer Kuratoriumssitzung einer Art Verh\u00f6r. \u201eEs wurde gefordert, dass alle diese Themen aus dem Programm der Akademie gestrichen werden.\u201c Parallel dazu erschien ein Artikel mit der \u00dcberschrift \u201aDie S\u00fcnde h\u00e4lt Einzug in die Kirche\u2018. Daneben ein Foto von Herta Leistner!\n\n\u201eMeine Chefs haben die Freiheit der Akademie verteidigt und es ist damals zwar ganz knapp, aber gut ausgegangen\u201c.\n\nEine \u00e4hnliche \u201aHexenjagd\u2018 wiederholte sich, als die EKD 1993 entschied, ein eigenes Frauenstudien- und Bildungszentrum in Gelnhausen einzurichten und Herta Leistner zu einer der beiden Studienleiterin bestellte. Evangelikale Gruppen sammelten Unterschriften und organisierten eine unglaublich h\u00e4ssliche Kampagne mit einem \u201aBitt- und Bu\u00dfgottesdienst\u2018. Dessen Predigt gipfelte mit dem Hinweis auf die Bibelstelle \u201adass wenn ein Mann bei einem Mann liegt, wie bei einer Frau, ihr sie t\u00f6ten sollt\u2018.\n\nwiki-de\n\nsowie am Frauen-Studien- und Bildungszentrum der Evangelischen Kirche in Deutschland in Gelnhausen t\u00e4tig.\n\nHerta Leistner gilt als Vork\u00e4mpferin f\u00fcr die Rechte von Frauen und Lesben innerhalb der Kirchen. Am 27. August 1996 erhielt sie das Bundesverdienstkreuz am Bande.[2] Daraufhin gab Wolfhart Pannenberg sein Bundesverdienstkreuz zur\u00fcck.\n\n\n[[:de:Elisabeth Moltmann-Wendel|Elisabeth Moltmann-Wendel]]\n\n--->\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Leistner, Herta}}\n[[Category:People from Calw]]\n[[Category:People from Stuttgart]]\n[[Category:20th-century German educators]]\n[[Category:21st-century German educators]]\n[[Category:Sociology educators]]\n[[Category:German writers]]\n[[Category:German Protestant clergy]]\n[[Category:German women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:LGBT rights activists from Germany]]\n[[Category:German evangelicals]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Charles01", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Denkendorf\u2192Denkendorf, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herta_Leistner"}

As this mythology influenced other religions, the rakshasa was later incorporated into [[Buddhism]]. Rakshasas are also called \"Maneaters\" (''Nri-chakshas,'' ''Kravyads''). A female rakshasa is known as a '''Rakshasi'''. A female Rakshasa in human form is a '''Rakshesha'''. The terms ''[[Asura]]'' and Rakshasa are sometimes used interchangeably.\n\n== Hindu lore ==\n===Vedic and Puranic stories===\n[[File:Varaha avtar, killing a demon to protect Bhu, c1740.jpg|thumb|Death of [[Hiranyaksha]], the son of Diti, at the hands of Vishnu's [[avatar]], [[Varaha]].]]\nRakshasas were believed to have been created from the breath of [[Brahma]] when he was asleep at the end of the [[Satya Yuga]]. As soon as they were created, they were so filled with bloodlust that they started eating Brahma himself. Brahma shouted \"''Rakshama!''\" (Sanskrit for \"Protect me!\") and [[Vishnu]] came to his aid, banishing to Earth all Rakshasas (named after Brahma's cry for help).\n\nTheir literary origins can be traced to Vedic sources through Hymn 87 of the tenth [[mandala]] of the ''[[Rigveda]]''. They are classified amongst the ''Yatudhanas'', mythological beings that consume raw flesh.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.answers.com/search|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|website=Answers.com|accessdate=7 January 2020}}</ref><ref>[[Wikisource:The Rig Veda/Mandala 10/Hymn 87]]</ref>\n\n===Description===\nRakshasas were most often depicted as ugly, fierce-looking and enormous creatures, with two [[fang]]s protruding from the top of the mouth and having sharp, claw-like fingernails. They are shown as being mean, growling like beasts, and as insatiable [[man-eaters]] that could smell the scent of human flesh. Some of the more ferocious ones were shown with flaming red eyes and hair, drinking [[blood]] with their palms or from a human skull (similar to representations of [[vampires]] in later Western mythology). Generally they could fly, vanish, and had ''Maya'' (magical powers of illusion), which enabled them to change size at will and assume the form of any creature. The female equivalent of rakshasa is rakshasi.<ref>{{cite book|title=India through the Ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/72 72]|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}</ref>\n\n=== In Hindu epics ===\nIn the world of the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], Rakshasas were a populous race. There were both good and evil rakshasas, and as warriors they fought alongside the armies of both good and evil. They were powerful warriors, expert magicians and illusionists. As shape-changers, they could assume different physical forms. As illusionists, they were capable of creating appearances which were real to those who believed in them or who failed to dispel them. Some of the rakshasas were said to be man-eaters, and made their gleeful appearance when the slaughter on a battlefield was at its worst. Occasionally they served as rank-and-file soldiers in the service of one or another warlord.\n\nAside from its treatment of unnamed rank-and-file Rakshasas, the epics tell the stories of certain members of the \"race\" who rose to prominence, some of them as heroes, most of them as villains.\n\n====In the ''Ramayana''====\nThe Battle of Lanka pitted an army of Rakshasas under [[Ravana]] against an army of [[Vanara]]s, under [[Rama]] and [[Sugriva]].\n[[File:Ravana British Museum.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Ravana]] the king of [[Lanka]] with ten heads, was the commander of Rakshasas.]]\n[[File:Maruti slew Jambumali with one stroke of an iron rod.jpg|thumb|[[Hanuman|Maruti]] slew Jambumali the commander, with one stroke of an iron rod]]\n\n* [[Ravana]] was the King of Lanka. He had ten heads and was the commander of the Rakshasas. He was the immortal enemy of [[Rama]], the hero of the ''[[Ramayana]].'' In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (Book III: Vana Parva, Section 271 ff.), the Sage [[Markandeya]] recounts the story of how Ravana kidnapped Rama's wife [[Sita]] and whisked her off to his stronghold Lanka. Rama, aided by the monkey King [[Sugriva]] and his army of monkeys, laid siege to Lanka, slew Ravana, and rescued Sita.\n* [[Vibhishana]] was [[Ravana]]'s younger brother. He was beautiful, pious and assiduous in his religious observances. When [[Brahma]] granted him a boon, he asked never to swerve from the path of righteousness and to always be illumined by divine knowledge (Book III, Vana Parva: Section 273.) Vibhishana joined [[Rama]] in his campaign against Ravana and helped Rama's army to cross the ocean into Lanka (Section 281). When invisible Rakshasas infiltrated Rama's camp, Vibhishana caused them to become visible; this enabled Rama's monkey soldiers to destroy them (Section 283). After Rama's final victory over Ravana, the loyal Vibhishana was made king of Lanka and remaining Rakshasas (Section 289).\n* [[Kumbhakarna]] was another brother of [[Ravana]]; he was sometimes referred to as a Rakshasa because of his frightening appearance and size. Like Rakshasas, he had an enormous appetite and ate large quantities of food and meat. A fearsome warrior and master of illusion, he slept through most of the Battle of Lanka (having long before requested and received a gift of long-lasting sleep from [[Brahma]]). When Ravana awakened him with alarming news about the conflict, he arose and took the field. Upon marching out of the city, Kumbhakarna was immediately swarmed by [[Rama]]'s monkeys; he just laughed and wreaked great mayhem amidst them. When the monkey king [[Sugriva]] attacked, Kumbhakarna grabbed him and started to drag him off. At that point [[Rama]] and his brother [[Lakshmana]] used arrows and a secret ''[[Brahmastra]]'' (\"Brahma's weapon\") to kill [[Kumbhakarna]], dropping him \"like a huge tree cleft in twain by a thunderbolt.\" (''Ramayana,'' Book III: Vana Parva, Section 285.)\n\nOther Rakshasas that are featured in the Ramayana include [[Kabandha]], [[Tataka]] (sometimes called Taraka), [[Shurpanakha]], [[Maricha]], [[Subahu]], [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]], [[Prahasta]], [[Akshayakumara]], [[Atikaya]], and [[Indrajit]] - the most powerful son of [[Ravana]].\n\n====In the Mahabharata====\nThe [[Pandava]] hero [[Bhima]] was the nemesis of forest-dwelling Rakshasas who dined on human travellers and terrorized human settlements.\n* Bhima killed [[Hidimba]], a cannibal Rakshasa. The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (Book I: Adi Parva, Section 154) describes him as a cruel cannibal with sharp, long teeth and prodigious strength. When Hidimba saw the Pandavas sleeping in his forest, he decided to eat them. He sent his sister [[Hidimbi]] to reconnoiter the situation, and the young woman fell in love with the handsome Bhima, whom she warned of danger. Infuriated, Hidimba declared he was ready to kill not only the Pandavas but also his sister, but he was thwarted by the heroism of Bhima, who defeated and killed him in a duel.\n[[File:Hidimbi - the sister of Hidimba.jpg|thumb|Hidimbi - the sister of Hidimba]]\n\n* [[Ghatotkacha]], a Rakshasa who fought on the side of the Pandavas, was the son of Bhima and the Rakshasa Hidimbi, who had fallen in love with the hero and warned him of danger from her brother. Bhima killed the evil Rakshasa Hidimba. Their son's name refers to his round bald head; ''ghata'' means 'pot' and ''utkacha'' means 'head' in [[Sanskrit]]. Ghatotkacha is considered a loyal and humble figure. He and his followers were available to his father Bhima at any time; all Bhima had to do was to think of him and he would appear. Like his father, Ghatotkacha primarily fought with the [[Gada (mace)|mace]]. His wife was [[Ahilawati]] and his son was [[Barbarika]].\n\nIn the ''Mahabharata,'' Ghatotkacha was summoned by Bhima to fight on the Pandava side in the [[Kurukshetra War]]. Invoking his magical powers, he wrought great havoc in the Kaurava army. In particular, after the death of [[Jayadratha]], when the battle continued on past sunset, his powers were at their most effective (at night). After performing many heroic deeds on the battlefield and fighting numerous duels with other great warriors (including the Rakshasa Alamvusha, the elephant-riding King [[Bhagadatta]], and [[Ashwatthama|Aswatthaman]], the son of [[Drona]]), Ghatotkacha encountered the human hero [[Karna]]. At this point in the battle, the Kaurava leader [[Duryodhana]] had appealed to his best fighter, [[Karna]], to kill Ghatotkacha, as the entire Kaurava army was near annihilation due to his ceaseless strikes from the air. Karna possessed a divine weapon, [[Shakti]], granted by the god Indra. It could be used only once and Karna had been saving it to use on his arch-enemy [[Arjuna]], the best Pandava fighter. Unable to refuse Duryodhana, Karna used the Shakti against Ghatotkacha, killing him. This is considered to be the turning point of the war. After his death, the Pandava counselor [[Krishna]] smiled, as he considered the Pandava prince Arjuna to be saved from certain death, as Karna had used the ''Shakta'' divine weapon. A temple in [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], honors Ghatotkacha; it is located near the [[Hidimba Devi Temple]].\n* [[Bakasura]] was a cannibalistic forest-dwelling Rakshasa who terrorized the nearby human population by forcing them to take turns making him regular deliveries of food, including human victims. The Pandavas travelled into the area and took up residence with a local [[Brahmin]] family. Their turn came when they had to make a delivery to Bakasura, and they debated who among them should be sacrificed. The rugged Bhima volunteered to take care of the matter. Bhima went into the forest with the food delivery (consuming it on the way to annoy Bakasura). He engaged Bakasura in a ferocious wrestling match, and broke his back. The human townspeople were amazed and grateful. The local Rakshasas begged for mercy, which Bhima granted them on the condition that they give up cannibalism. The Rakshasas agreed and soon acquired a reputation for being peaceful towards humans. (Book I: Adi Parva, Sections 159-166.)\n* [[Kirmira]], the brother of Bakasura, was a cannibal and master illusionist. He haunted the wood of Kamyaka, dining on human travellers. Like his brother before him, Kirmira also made the mistake of fighting the Pandav hero Bhima, who killed him with his bare hands (Book III: Varna Parva, Section 11).\n* [[Jatasura]] was a cunning Rakshasa who, disguised as a [[Brahmin]], attempted to steal the Pandavas' weapons and to ravish [[Draupadi]], wife of [[Arjuna]]. Bhima arrived in time to intervene, and killed Jatasur in a duel. (Book III: Varna Parva, Section 156). Jatasur's son was Alamvush, who fought on the side of the [[Kaurava]]s at [[Kurukshetra]].\n\n[[File:Karna Attacks Ghatotkacha.jpg|thumb|Karna Attacks Ghatotkacha]]\nRakshasa heroes fought on both sides in the Kurukshetra war.\n\n* [[Alambusha]] was a Rakshasa skilled at fighting with both conventional weapons and the powers of illusion. According to the ''Mahabharata'', he fought on the side of the Kauravas. [[Arjuna]] defeated him in a duel (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 167), as did Arjuna's son [[Abhimanyu]] (Book VI: Bhishma Parva, Section 101\u2013102). But Alamvusha in turn killed [[Iravan]], Arjuna's son by a [[N\u0101ga]] princess [[Ulupi]], when the Rakshasa used his powers of illusion to take on the form of [[Garuda]]. Alamvusha was also defeated by Bhima (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 107). He was slain by Bhima's son, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 108).\n\n==In Buddhist lore==\n===Theravada Buddhist literature===\nIn the Maha Samaya Sutta, [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] (also known as ''Namuci'' or the \"Dark One\") is the defeated antagonist of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. He is described as a corrupted Asura, whose army consisted of \"Sensual passions, Discontent, Hunger and Thirst, Craving, Sloth and Drowsiness, Terror, Uncertainty, Hypocrisy and Stubbornness, Gains, Offerings, Fame and Status wrongly gained, and whoever would praise self and disparage others\" (Sn 3.2 Padhana Sutta). The Asuras try to capture the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s and bind them. However, not all Asuras are Rakshasas.\n\nThe Alavaka Sutta (SN 10.12) of the [[P\u0101li Canon]] recounts a story in which the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was harassed by a Rakshasa. The latter asked him to leave and then to return, over and over. When the Buddha refused to leave, the Rakshasa threatened to harm him if he could not answer his questions. The rest of the sutta concerns the question and answer dialogue. At the end, the rakshasa is convinced of the Buddha's holiness and becomes a follower.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn10/sn10.012.piya.html|title=Alavaka Sutta: Discourse to Alavaka|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|accessdate=7 January 2020}}</ref> [[Sri Lanka]]n (Sinhala) ancestral legends refer to Yakshas as well.\n\nOne of Buddha's ten titles is \u201cPurisa Dama Sarati sata deva manusanam Buddho baghavati\u201d meaning the teacher of gods, men, animals and Rakshasas.\n\n===Mahayana Buddhist literature===\nChapter 26 of the [[Lotus Sutra]] includes a dialogue between the Buddha and a group of rakshasa daughters, who swear to uphold and protect the [[Lotus Sutra]].

The terms ''[[Asura]]'' and Rakshasa are sometimes used interchangeably.\n\n== Hindu lore ==\n===Vedic and Puranic stories===\n[[File:Varaha avtar, killing a demon to protect Bhu, c1740.jpg|thumb|Death of [[Hiranyaksha]], the son of Diti, at the hands of Vishnu's [[avatar]], [[Varaha]].]]\nRakshasas were believed to have been created from the breath of [[Brahma]] when he was asleep at the end of the [[Satya Yuga]]. As soon as they were created, they were so filled with bloodlust that they started eating Brahma himself. Brahma shouted \"''Rakshama!''\" (Sanskrit for \"Protect me!\") and [[Vishnu]] came to his aid, banishing to Earth all Rakshasas (named after Brahma's cry for help).\n\nTheir literary origins can be traced to Vedic sources through Hymn 87 of the tenth [[mandala]] of the ''[[Rigveda]]''. They are classified amongst the ''Yatudhanas'', mythological beings that consume raw flesh.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.answers.com/search|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|website=Answers.com|accessdate=7 January 2020}}</ref><ref>[[Wikisource:The Rig Veda/Mandala 10/Hymn 87]]</ref>\n\n===Description===\nRakshasas were most often depicted as ugly, fierce-looking and enormous creatures, with two [[fang]]s protruding from the top of the mouth and having sharp, claw-like fingernails. They are shown as being mean, growling like beasts, and as insatiable [[man-eaters]] that could smell the scent of human flesh. Some of the more ferocious ones were shown with flaming red eyes and hair, drinking [[blood]] with their palms or from a human skull (similar to representations of [[vampires]] in later Western mythology). Generally they could fly, vanish, and had ''Maya'' (magical powers of illusion), which enabled them to change size at will and assume the form of any creature. The female equivalent of rakshasa is rakshasi.<ref>{{cite book|title=India through the Ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/72 72]|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}</ref>\n\n=== In Hindu epics ===\nIn the world of the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], Rakshasas were a populous race. There were both good and evil rakshasas, and as warriors they fought alongside the armies of both good and evil. They were powerful warriors, expert magicians and illusionists. As shape-changers, they could assume different physical forms. As illusionists, they were capable of creating appearances which were real to those who believed in them or who failed to dispel them. Some of the rakshasas were said to be man-eaters, and made their gleeful appearance when the slaughter on a battlefield was at its worst. Occasionally they served as rank-and-file soldiers in the service of one or another warlord.\n\nAside from its treatment of unnamed rank-and-file Rakshasas, the epics tell the stories of certain members of the \"race\" who rose to prominence, some of them as heroes, most of them as villains.\n\n====In the ''Ramayana''====\nThe Battle of Lanka pitted an army of Rakshasas under [[Ravana]] against an army of [[Vanara]]s, under [[Rama]] and [[Sugriva]].\n[[File:Ravana British Museum.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Ravana]] the king of [[Lanka]] with ten heads, was the commander of Rakshasas.]]\n[[File:Maruti slew Jambumali with one stroke of an iron rod.jpg|thumb|[[Hanuman|Maruti]] slew Jambumali the commander, with one stroke of an iron rod]]\n\n* [[Ravana]] was the King of Lanka. He had ten heads and was the commander of the Rakshasas. He was the immortal enemy of [[Rama]], the hero of the ''[[Ramayana]].'' In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (Book III: Vana Parva, Section 271 ff.), the Sage [[Markandeya]] recounts the story of how Ravana kidnapped Rama's wife [[Sita]] and whisked her off to his stronghold Lanka. Rama, aided by the monkey King [[Sugriva]] and his army of monkeys, laid siege to Lanka, slew Ravana, and rescued Sita.\n* [[Vibhishana]] was [[Ravana]]'s younger brother. He was beautiful, pious and assiduous in his religious observances. When [[Brahma]] granted him a boon, he asked never to swerve from the path of righteousness and to always be illumined by divine knowledge (Book III, Vana Parva: Section 273.) Vibhishana joined [[Rama]] in his campaign against Ravana and helped Rama's army to cross the ocean into Lanka (Section 281). When invisible Rakshasas infiltrated Rama's camp, Vibhishana caused them to become visible; this enabled Rama's monkey soldiers to destroy them (Section 283). After Rama's final victory over Ravana, the loyal Vibhishana was made king of Lanka and remaining Rakshasas (Section 289).\n* [[Kumbhakarna]] was another brother of [[Ravana]]; he was sometimes referred to as a Rakshasa because of his frightening appearance and size. Like Rakshasas, he had an enormous appetite and ate large quantities of food and meat. A fearsome warrior and master of illusion, he slept through most of the Battle of Lanka (having long before requested and received a gift of long-lasting sleep from [[Brahma]]). When Ravana awakened him with alarming news about the conflict, he arose and took the field. Upon marching out of the city, Kumbhakarna was immediately swarmed by [[Rama]]'s monkeys; he just laughed and wreaked great mayhem amidst them. When the monkey king [[Sugriva]] attacked, Kumbhakarna grabbed him and started to drag him off. At that point [[Rama]] and his brother [[Lakshmana]] used arrows and a secret ''[[Brahmastra]]'' (\"Brahma's weapon\") to kill [[Kumbhakarna]], dropping him \"like a huge tree cleft in twain by a thunderbolt.\" (''Ramayana,'' Book III: Vana Parva, Section 285.)\n\nOther Rakshasas that are featured in the Ramayana include [[Kabandha]], [[Tataka]] (sometimes called Taraka), [[Shurpanakha]], [[Maricha]], [[Subahu]], [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]], [[Prahasta]], [[Akshayakumara]], [[Atikaya]], and [[Indrajit]] - the most powerful son of [[Ravana]].\n\n====In the Mahabharata====\nThe [[Pandava]] hero [[Bhima]] was the nemesis of forest-dwelling Rakshasas who dined on human travellers and terrorized human settlements.\n* Bhima killed [[Hidimba]], a cannibal Rakshasa. The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (Book I: Adi Parva, Section 154) describes him as a cruel cannibal with sharp, long teeth and prodigious strength. When Hidimba saw the Pandavas sleeping in his forest, he decided to eat them. He sent his sister [[Hidimbi]] to reconnoiter the situation, and the young woman fell in love with the handsome Bhima, whom she warned of danger. Infuriated, Hidimba declared he was ready to kill not only the Pandavas but also his sister, but he was thwarted by the heroism of Bhima, who defeated and killed him in a duel.\n[[File:Hidimbi - the sister of Hidimba.jpg|thumb|Hidimbi - the sister of Hidimba]]\n\n* [[Ghatotkacha]], a Rakshasa who fought on the side of the Pandavas, was the son of Bhima and the Rakshasa Hidimbi, who had fallen in love with the hero and warned him of danger from her brother. Bhima killed the evil Rakshasa Hidimba. Their son's name refers to his round bald head; ''ghata'' means 'pot' and ''utkacha'' means 'head' in [[Sanskrit]]. Ghatotkacha is considered a loyal and humble figure. He and his followers were available to his father Bhima at any time; all Bhima had to do was to think of him and he would appear. Like his father, Ghatotkacha primarily fought with the [[Gada (mace)|mace]]. His wife was [[Ahilawati]] and his son was [[Barbarika]].\n\nIn the ''Mahabharata,'' Ghatotkacha was summoned by Bhima to fight on the Pandava side in the [[Kurukshetra War]]. Invoking his magical powers, he wrought great havoc in the Kaurava army. In particular, after the death of [[Jayadratha]], when the battle continued on past sunset, his powers were at their most effective (at night). After performing many heroic deeds on the battlefield and fighting numerous duels with other great warriors (including the Rakshasa Alamvusha, the elephant-riding King [[Bhagadatta]], and [[Ashwatthama|Aswatthaman]], the son of [[Drona]]), Ghatotkacha encountered the human hero [[Karna]]. At this point in the battle, the Kaurava leader [[Duryodhana]] had appealed to his best fighter, [[Karna]], to kill Ghatotkacha, as the entire Kaurava army was near annihilation due to his ceaseless strikes from the air. Karna possessed a divine weapon, [[Shakti]], granted by the god Indra. It could be used only once and Karna had been saving it to use on his arch-enemy [[Arjuna]], the best Pandava fighter. Unable to refuse Duryodhana, Karna used the Shakti against Ghatotkacha, killing him. This is considered to be the turning point of the war. After his death, the Pandava counselor [[Krishna]] smiled, as he considered the Pandava prince Arjuna to be saved from certain death, as Karna had used the ''Shakta'' divine weapon. A temple in [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], honors Ghatotkacha; it is located near the [[Hidimba Devi Temple]].\n* [[Bakasura]] was a cannibalistic forest-dwelling Rakshasa who terrorized the nearby human population by forcing them to take turns making him regular deliveries of food, including human victims. The Pandavas travelled into the area and took up residence with a local [[Brahmin]] family. Their turn came when they had to make a delivery to Bakasura, and they debated who among them should be sacrificed. The rugged Bhima volunteered to take care of the matter. Bhima went into the forest with the food delivery (consuming it on the way to annoy Bakasura). He engaged Bakasura in a ferocious wrestling match, and broke his back. The human townspeople were amazed and grateful. The local Rakshasas begged for mercy, which Bhima granted them on the condition that they give up cannibalism. The Rakshasas agreed and soon acquired a reputation for being peaceful towards humans. (Book I: Adi Parva, Sections 159-166.)\n* [[Kirmira]], the brother of Bakasura, was a cannibal and master illusionist. He haunted the wood of Kamyaka, dining on human travellers. Like his brother before him, Kirmira also made the mistake of fighting the Pandav hero Bhima, who killed him with his bare hands (Book III: Varna Parva, Section 11).\n* [[Jatasura]] was a cunning Rakshasa who, disguised as a [[Brahmin]], attempted to steal the Pandavas' weapons and to ravish [[Draupadi]], wife of [[Arjuna]]. Bhima arrived in time to intervene, and killed Jatasur in a duel. (Book III: Varna Parva, Section 156). Jatasur's son was Alamvush, who fought on the side of the [[Kaurava]]s at [[Kurukshetra]].\n\n[[File:Karna Attacks Ghatotkacha.jpg|thumb|Karna Attacks Ghatotkacha]]\nRakshasa heroes fought on both sides in the Kurukshetra war.\n\n* [[Alambusha]] was a Rakshasa skilled at fighting with both conventional weapons and the powers of illusion. According to the ''Mahabharata'', he fought on the side of the Kauravas. [[Arjuna]] defeated him in a duel (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 167), as did Arjuna's son [[Abhimanyu]] (Book VI: Bhishma Parva, Section 101\u2013102). But Alamvusha in turn killed [[Iravan]], Arjuna's son by a [[N\u0101ga]] princess [[Ulupi]], when the Rakshasa used his powers of illusion to take on the form of [[Garuda]]. Alamvusha was also defeated by Bhima (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 107). He was slain by Bhima's son, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 108).\n\n==In Buddhist lore==\n===Theravada Buddhist literature===\nIn the Maha Samaya Sutta, [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] (also known as ''Namuci'' or the \"Dark One\") is the defeated antagonist of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. He is described as a corrupted Asura, whose army consisted of \"Sensual passions, Discontent, Hunger and Thirst, Craving, Sloth and Drowsiness, Terror, Uncertainty, Hypocrisy and Stubbornness, Gains, Offerings, Fame and Status wrongly gained, and whoever would praise self and disparage others\" (Sn 3.2 Padhana Sutta). The Asuras try to capture the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s and bind them. However, not all Asuras are Rakshasas.\n\nThe Alavaka Sutta (SN 10.12) of the [[P\u0101li Canon]] recounts a story in which the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was harassed by a Rakshasa. The latter asked him to leave and then to return, over and over. When the Buddha refused to leave, the Rakshasa threatened to harm him if he could not answer his questions. The rest of the sutta concerns the question and answer dialogue. At the end, the rakshasa is convinced of the Buddha's holiness and becomes a follower.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn10/sn10.012.piya.html|title=Alavaka Sutta: Discourse to Alavaka|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|accessdate=7 January 2020}}</ref> [[Sri Lanka]]n (Sinhala) ancestral legends refer to Yakshas as well.\n\nOne of Buddha's ten titles is \u201cPurisa Dama Sarati sata deva manusanam Buddho baghavati\u201d meaning the teacher of gods, men, animals and Rakshasas.\n\n===Mahayana Buddhist literature===\nChapter 26 of the [[Lotus Sutra]] includes a dialogue between the Buddha and a group of rakshasa daughters, who swear to uphold and protect the [[Lotus Sutra]].

The film opened in February 2000 to positive critical acclaim and become a successful venture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ajithkumar.free.fr/filmographie/inter11.htm|title=WWW.ajithkumar.fr.fm}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSridhar ([[Ajith (actor)|Ajith]]) is from a middle-class family headed by his father ([[K. Vishwanath]]). Shiva ([[Raghuvaran]]) is Sridhar's elder brother and the breadwinner for the family, consisting of his wife Shantha ([[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]]) and sister (Preitha Raghav). Sridhar, upon completion of his graduation, aspires to become a music director and tries hard to secure a chance in movies, but all his efforts go in vain. Sridhar's search for a chance continues for eight years. Despite that, his family members support him very well and encourage him whenever he feels dejected.\n\nSridhar meets and befriends Viji Chandrasekhar ([[Jyothika]]). Viji also likes Sridhar and his aspiration. Slowly, love blossoms between them. Viji gets introduced to Sridhar's family, and they too like her. However, Sridhar has plans of marrying her only after getting his first break in music. Viji also understands Sridhar and supports him. A CD shop owner ([[Manivannan]]) is Sridhar's neighbor, and he also encourages him. Sridhar gets an opportunity to compose music for a film. He feels extremely happy and goes for recording. Unfortunately on the same day, the producer meets with an accident, and the movie is dropped.\n\nViji's younger sister Sudha (Soumya) gets a good marriage alliance, but the groom's family finds it odd upon seeing Viji being unmarried. Viji's father ([[Jaiganesh]]) requests Sridhar and Viji to get married so that it does not stop his younger daughter's wedding proposal. Viji's father asks Sridhar to leave away his dream of becoming a music director as he has been already trying hard for years. He also offers him a job so that he can marry Viji.\n\nHowever, Sridhar refuses to let go his dream. He is ready to sacrifice his love for the sake of his ambition. He requests Viji to marry someone else as he cannot give up his passion for music. One day, Shiva has a heart attack and is admitted to the hospital. The doctors say that Shiva has heart problems and needs rest. Sridhar is shocked to see his brother's condition. As Shiva was the only income earner in the family, now Shantha and Preitha decide to take up some jobs to help earn money for the family.\n\nSridhar worries seeing that, though he also feels proud about the love and affection shown by his family members towards him, as no one asked him to forego his ambition and take up some job despite this condition. However, Sridhar decides to go for a job so he could ease his family's financial burden. He informs this and leaves for an interview.\n\nInitially the movie had a climax, where it is shown that Sridhar gives up his ambition and starts working. Also, Viji is also married to someone else, whereby Sridhar lost both his love and his passion. Later on, the climax was changed, and is shown that after a few years, Sridhar secures a chance to compose music and he becomes a leading music composer. Also he marries Viji.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith (actor)|Ajith]] as Sridhar{{efn|Ajith Kumar is credited as \"Ajith\" in the film.}}\n* [[Jyothika]] as Viji Chandrasekhar\n* [[Raghuvaran]] as Shiva\n* [[K.

Ajith, Jyothika, Raghuvaran, Vivek |publisher=Movies.bizhat.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25}}</ref>\n\nThe story revolves around the conflicting emotions of ambition, love and responsibility that the protagonist, Sridhar, played by Ajith, goes through in his quest to become a successful music composer. The film opened in February 2000 to positive critical acclaim and become a successful venture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ajithkumar.free.fr/filmographie/inter11.htm|title=WWW.ajithkumar.fr.fm}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSridhar ([[Ajith (actor)|Ajith]]) is from a middle-class family headed by his father ([[K. Vishwanath]]). Shiva ([[Raghuvaran]]) is Sridhar's elder brother and the breadwinner for the family, consisting of his wife Shantha ([[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]]) and sister (Preitha Raghav). Sridhar, upon completion of his graduation, aspires to become a music director and tries hard to secure a chance in movies, but all his efforts go in vain. Sridhar's search for a chance continues for eight years. Despite that, his family members support him very well and encourage him whenever he feels dejected.\n\nSridhar meets and befriends Viji Chandrasekhar ([[Jyothika]]). Viji also likes Sridhar and his aspiration. Slowly, love blossoms between them. Viji gets introduced to Sridhar's family, and they too like her. However, Sridhar has plans of marrying her only after getting his first break in music. Viji also understands Sridhar and supports him. A CD shop owner ([[Manivannan]]) is Sridhar's neighbor, and he also encourages him. Sridhar gets an opportunity to compose music for a film. He feels extremely happy and goes for recording. Unfortunately on the same day, the producer meets with an accident, and the movie is dropped.\n\nViji's younger sister Sudha (Soumya) gets a good marriage alliance, but the groom's family finds it odd upon seeing Viji being unmarried. Viji's father ([[Jaiganesh]]) requests Sridhar and Viji to get married so that it does not stop his younger daughter's wedding proposal. Viji's father asks Sridhar to leave away his dream of becoming a music director as he has been already trying hard for years. He also offers him a job so that he can marry Viji.\n\nHowever, Sridhar refuses to let go his dream. He is ready to sacrifice his love for the sake of his ambition. He requests Viji to get married to someone else as he cannot give up his passion for music. One day, Shiva gets a heart attack and is admitted to the hospital. The doctors say that Shiva has heart problems and needs rest. Sridhar is shocked to see his brother's condition. As Shiva was the only income earner in the family, now Shantha and Preitha decide to take up some jobs to help earn money for the family.\n\nSridhar worries seeing that, though he also feels proud about the love and affection shown by his family members towards him, as no one asked him to forego his ambition and take up some job despite this condition. However, Sridhar decides to go for a job so he could ease his family's financial burden. He informs this and leaves for an interview.\n\nInitially the movie had a climax, where it is shown that Sridhar gives up his ambition and starts working. Also, Viji is also married to someone else, whereby Sridhar lost both his love and his passion. Later on, the climax was changed, and is shown that after a few years, Sridhar secures a chance to compose music and he becomes a leading music composer. Also he marries Viji.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith (actor)|Ajith]] as Sridhar{{efn|Ajith Kumar is credited as \"Ajith\" in the film.}}\n* [[Jyothika]] as Viji Chandrasekhar\n* [[Raghuvaran]] as Shiva\n* [[K.
