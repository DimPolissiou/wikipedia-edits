The Thirty-nine Articles form part of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' used by both the Church of England and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\nWhen [[Henry VIII]] broke with the Catholic Church and was [[excommunication|excommunicated]], he began the reform of the Church of England, which would be [[Supreme Head of the Church of England|headed]] by the monarch (himself) rather than the pope. At this point, he needed to determine what its doctrines and practices would be in relation to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the new [[Protestantism|Protestant movements]] in continental Europe. A series of defining documents were written and replaced over a period of 30 years as the doctrinal and political situation changed from the excommunication of Henry VIII in 1533, to the [[excommunication of Elizabeth I]] in 1570.  These positions began with the Ten Articles in 1536, and concluded with the finalisation of the Thirty-nine articles in 1571. The Thirty-nine articles ultimately served to define the doctrine of the Church of England as it related to [[Calvinist]] doctrine and Roman Catholic practice.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=1622}}\n\nThe articles went through at least five major revisions prior to their finalisation in 1571. The first attempt was the Ten Articles in 1536, which showed some slightly Protestant leanings \u2013 the result of an English desire for a political alliance with the German [[Lutheran]] princes.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=}} The next revision was the Six Articles in 1539 which swung away from all reformed positions,{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=}} and then the ''King's Book'' in 1543, which re-established most of the earlier Roman Catholic doctrines. During the reign of [[Edward VI]], Henry VIII's only son, the Forty-two Articles were written under the direction of [[Archbishop]] [[Thomas Cranmer]] in 1552. It was in this document that Calvinist thought reached the zenith of its influence in the English Church. These articles were never put into action, due to Edward VI's death and the reversion of the English Church to Roman Catholicism under Henry VIII's elder daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].\n\nFinally, upon the coronation of Elizabeth I and the re-establishment of the Church of England as separate from the Roman Catholic Church, the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion were initiated by the [[Convocation of 1563]], under the direction of [[Matthew Parker]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The articles pulled back from some of the more extreme Calvinist thinking and created the distinctive English reformed doctrine.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=1622}}\n\nThe Thirty-nine Articles were finalised in 1571, and incorporated into the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. Although not the end of the struggle between Catholic and Protestant monarchs and citizens, the book helped to standardise the English language, and was to have a lasting effect on [[religion in the United Kingdom]] and elsewhere through its wide use.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1999|p=}}\n\n==Predecessors==\n===Ten Articles (1536)===\nThe [[Church of England]]'s break with Rome inaugurated a period of doctrinal confusion and controversy as both conservative and reforming clergy attempted to shape the church's direction, the former as \"[[Catholicism]] without the [[Pope]]\" and the latter as [[Protestant]]. In an attempt \"to establish Christian quietness and unity\", the Ten Articles were adopted by clerical [[Convocations of Canterbury and York|Convocation]] in July 1536 as the English Church's first post-papal doctrinal statement.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 238}} The Ten Articles were crafted as a rushed interim compromise between conservatives and reformers. Historians have variously described it as a victory for [[Lutheranism]] and a success for Catholic resistance.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 128}} Its provisions have also been described as \"confusing\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nThe first five articles dealt with doctrines that were \"commanded expressly by God, and are necessary to our [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]]\", while the last five articles dealt with \"laudable ceremonies used in the Church\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 238}}{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} This division reflects how the Articles originated from two different discussions earlier in the year. The first five articles were based on the Wittenberg Articles negotiated between English ambassadors [[Edward Foxe]], [[Nicholas Heath]] and [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]] and German Lutheran theologians, including [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]]. This doctrinal statement was itself based on the [[Augsburg Confession]] of 1530.{{Sfn | \"Wittenberg Articles\"}}{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}}\n\nThe five principal doctrines were the [[Bible]] and [[ecumenical creeds]], [[baptism]], [[penance]], the [[Eucharist]] and [[Justification (theology)|justification]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} The core doctrine in the Ten Articles was [[justification by faith]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 129}} Justification \u2013 which was defined as [[Forgiveness|remission]] of [[sin]] and accepting into God's favour \u2013 was through \"the only mercy and [[Grace in Christianity|grace]] of the [[God the Father|Father]], promised freely unto us for his Son\u2019s sake [[Jesus Christ]], and the merits of his [[Blood of Christ|blood]] and [[Passion of Jesus|passion]]\".{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} [[Good works]] would follow, not precede, justification. However, the Lutheran influence was diluted with qualifications. Justification was attained \"by [[Contrition|contrition]] and [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] joined with [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]\".{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 129}}  In other words, good works were \"necessarily required to the attaining of everlasting life\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nTo the disappointment of conservatives, only three of the traditional seven [[sacrament]]s were even mentioned (baptism, the Eucharist and penance).{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} The Articles affirm the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], stating that \"under the form and figure of bread and wine ... is verily, substantially and really contained the very self-same body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} This definition was acceptable to those who held to [[transubstantiation]] or [[sacramental union]], but it clearly condemned [[sacramentarianism]]. More controversially for the reformers, the Articles maintained penance as a sacrament and the [[priest]]'s authority to grant divine [[absolution]] in [[Confession (religion)|confession]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nArticles six through ten focused on secondary issues. Significantly, [[purgatory]], which had been a central concern of medieval religion, was placed in the non-essential articles. On the question of its existence, the Ten Articles were ambiguous. It stated, \"the place where [departed souls] be, the name thereof, and kind of pains there\" was \"uncertain by scripture\". [[Prayer for the dead]] and [[Requiem|masses for the dead]] were permitted as possibly relieving the pain of departed souls in purgatory.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 240}} \n\nThe Articles also defended the use of a number of Catholic rituals and practices opposed by Protestants, such as kissing the cross on [[Good Friday]], while mildly criticizing popular abuses and excesses. The use of [[Religious images in Christian theology|religious images]] was permitted, but people were to be taught not to kneel before them or make [[Votive offering|offerings]] to them. Prayer to [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], and all the other [[saint]]s was permitted as long as [[superstition]] was avoided.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 238\u2013239}} \n\nIn summary, the Ten Articles asserted:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reformationhenryviii.com/1536-ten-articles.html | title = Ten Articles 1536 | website = reformationhenryviii.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180803183730/http://www.reformationhenryviii.com/1536-ten-articles.html | archive-date = August 3, 2018 | url-status = live | access-date = August 3, 2018 | ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n# The Bible and the three ecumenical creeds are the basis and summary of true Christian faith.\n# Baptism imparts [[Forgiveness|remission of sins]] and [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and is necessary for salvation, even in the case of infants. It condemns the opinions of [[Anabaptist]]s and [[Pelagianism|Pelagians]] as [[heresy]]. \n# The sacrament of penance, with confession and absolution, is necessary to salvation.\n# That the body and blood of Christ are really present in the Eucharist.\n# Justification is by faith, but good works are necessary.\n# Images can be used as representations of virtue and good example and also to remind people of their sins but are not objects of worship.\n# Saints are to be honoured as examples of life and as furthering the prayers of the faithful.\n# [[Intercession of saints|Praying to saints]] is permitted, and holy days should be observed.\n# The observance of various rites and ceremonies, such as clerical [[vestment]]s, sprinkling of [[holy water]], bearing of candles on [[Candlemas]], giving of ashes on [[Ash Wednesday]], is good and laudable. However, none of these has power to forgive sin. \n# It is a good and charitable deed to pray for the dead. However, the doctrine of purgatory is biblically uncertain. Abuses related to purgatory, such as the claim that papal [[indulgence]]s or masses for the dead offered at certain localities (such as the ''[[Santa Maria Scala Coeli|scala coeli]]'' mass) can deliver immediately from purgatory, are to be rejected.\n\n=== ''Bishops' Book'' (1537) ===\n\n[[Image:Thomas-Cranmer.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Thomas Cranmer]] headed the committee that authored the ''Bishop's Book''.]]\n\nThe failure of the Ten Articles to settle doctrinal controversy led [[Thomas Cromwell]], the King's [[vicegerent]] in spirituals, to convene a national [[synod]] of bishops and high-ranking clergy for further theological discussion in February 1537.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|pp=185\u2013186}} This synod produced a book called ''The Institution of the Christian Man'' (popularly called ''The Bishops' Book''), the word ''institution'' being synonymous with ''instruction''.{{Sfn| Blunt | 1878 | p = 444}} ''The Bishops' Book'' preserved the semi-Lutheranism of the Ten Articles, and the articles on justification, purgatory, and the sacraments of baptism, the Eucharist and penance were incorporated unchanged into the new book.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 255}}\n \nWhen the synod met, conservatives were still angry that four of the traditional seven sacraments ([[confirmation]], marriage, [[holy orders]] and [[extreme unction]]) had been excluded from the Ten Articles. [[John Stokesley]] argued for all seven, while [[Thomas Cranmer]] only acknowledged baptism and the Eucharist. The others divided along party lines. The conservatives were at a disadvantage because they found it necessary to appeal to [[sacred tradition]], which violated Cromwell's instructions that all arguments refer to scripture.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|pp=187\u2013188}} \n\nIn the end, the missing sacraments were restored but placed in a separate section to emphasize \"a difference in dignity and necessity.\" Only baptism, the Eucharist and penance were \"instituted of Christ, to be as certain instruments or remedies necessary for our salvation\".{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 254}} Confirmation was declared to have been introduced by the [[early Church]] in imitation of what they had read about the [[Christian laying on of hands|practice of the Apostles]].{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=189}} \n\nThe ''Bishops' Book'' also included expositions on the creed, the [[Ten Commandments]], the [[Lord's Prayer]] and [[Hail Mary]].{{Sfn| Blunt | 1878 | p = 446}} These were greatly influenced by [[William Marshall (translator)|William Marshall]]'s primer (lay [[Christian devotional literature|devotional]] book) of 1535, which itself was influenced by Luther's writings.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 256}} Following Marshall, ''The Bishops' Book'' rejected the traditional Catholic numbering of the Ten Commandments, in which the [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|prohibition on making and worshiping graven images]] was part of the first commandment, \"[[Thou shalt have no other gods before me]]\". In agreement with the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]]'s church at Zurich, the authors of the ''Bishops' Book'' adopted the Jewish tradition of separating these commandments. While allowing images of Christ and the saints, the exposition on the second commandment taught against representations of [[God the Father]] and criticised those who \"be more ready with their substance to deck dead images gorgeously and gloriously, than with the same to help poor Christian people, the quick and lively [[Image of God|images of God]]\".{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 256}} Such teachings encouraged [[iconoclasm]], which would become a feature of the English Reformation.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=192}} \n\nThe list of the 46 divines as they appear in the ''Bishop's Book'' included all of the [[bishop]]s, eight [[archdeacon]]s and 17 other [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctors of Divinity]], some of whom were later involved with translating the [[Great Bible|Bible]] and compiling the [[The Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]]:{{Sfn| Blunt | 1878 | p = 445}}\n\n[[Thomas Cranmer]] \u2013\n[[Edward Lee, Archbishop of York|Edward Lee]] \u2013\n[[John Stokesley]] \u2013\n[[Cuthbert Tunstall]] \u2013\n[[Stephen Gardiner]] \u2013\n[[Robert Aldrich, Bishop of Carlisle|Robert Aldrich]] \u2013\n[[John Voysey]] \u2013\n[[John Longland]] \u2013\n[[John Clerk, Bishop of Bath and Wells|John Clerk]] \u2013\n[[Rowland Lee]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Goodrich]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Shaxton]] \u2013\n[[John Bird (Bishop)|John Bird]] \u2013\n[[Edward Foxe]] \u2013\n[[Hugh Latimer]] \u2013\n[[John Hilsey]] \u2013\n[[Richard Sampson]] \u2013\n[[William Repps]] \u2013\n[[William Barlowe]] \u2013\n[[Robert Partew]] \u2013\n[[Robert Holgate]] \u2013\n[[Richard Wolman]] \u2013\n[[William Knight (royal servant)|William Knight]] \u2013\n[[John Bell, Bishop of Worcester|John Bell]] \u2013\n[[Edmund Bonner|Edmond Bonner]] \u2013\n[[William Skip]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Heath]] \u2013\n[[Cuthbert Marshal]] \u2013\n[[Richard Curren]] \u2013\n[[William Cliffe]] \u2013\n[[William Downes (divine)|William Downes]] \u2013\n[[Robert Oking]] \u2013\n[[Ralph Bradford]] \u2013\n[[Richard Smyth (Regius Professor)|Richard Smyth]] \u2013\n[[Simon Matthew]] \u2013\n[[John Pryn]] \u2013\n[[William Buckmaster]] \u2013\n[[William May (theologian)|William May]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Wotton]] \u2013\n[[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]] \u2013\n[[John Edmunds (academic)|John Edmunds]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Robertson (divine)|Thomas Robertson]] \u2013\n[[John Baker (English statesman)|John Baker]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Barett]] \u2013\n[[John Hase]] \u2013\n[[John Tyson (divine)|John Tyson]]\n\nIn August 1537, it was presented to the King who ordered that parts should be read from the pulpit every Sunday and feast day.

And he amended the First Commandment ('Thou shalt have none other gods but me') to read 'Thou shalt not have nor repute any other God, or gods, but me Jesu Christ.'\"</ref> weakened the original's emphasis on justification by faith.

Bishop Tunstall was involved in negotiations as well.</ref>\n\nThe Germans presented, as a basis of agreement, a number of articles based on the Lutheran Confession of Augsburg. Bishops [[Cuthbert Tunstall|Tunstall]], [[John Stokesley|Stokesley]] and others were not won over by these Protestant arguments and did everything they could to avoid agreement. They were willing to separate from Rome, but their plan was to unite with the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]] and not with the Protestants on the continent.{{sfn|D'Aubign\u00e9|1972|p=}} The bishops also refused to eliminate what the Germans considered abuses (e.g. private masses for the dead, compulsory [[clerical celibacy]], and withholding [[communion wine]] from the [[laity]]) allowed by the English Church.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=219}} Stokesley considered these customs to be essential because the Greek Church practised them.{{sfn|D'Aubign\u00e9|1972|p=}} As the King was unwilling to break with these practices, the Germans had all left England by 1 October.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=221}}\n\nMeanwhile, England was in religious turmoil. Impatient Protestants took it upon themselves to further reform \u2014 some priests said mass in English rather than Latin and married without authorisation (Archbishop Cranmer was himself secretly married). Protestants themselves were divided between establishment reformers who held Lutheran beliefs upholding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and radicals who held [[Anabaptist]] and [[Sacramentarian]] views denying real presence.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 269\u2013270}} In May 1539, a new Parliament met, and [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Audley]] told the [[House of Lords]] that the King desired religious uniformity. A committee of four conservative and four reformist bishops was appointed to examine and determine doctrine.<ref>{{Harvnb| Marshall | 2017 | p = 273}}: The committee was headed by Cromwell, the vicegerent, and the bishops included Cranmer and his Protestant allies \u2014 Latimer, Goodrich, Salcot \u2014 and their traditionalist counterparts Lee, Tunstall, Clerk and Robert Aldrich of Carlisle.</ref> On May 16, the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] noted that the committee had not agreed on anything and proposed that the Lords examine six controversial doctrinal questions that became the basis of the Six Articles:\n\n#whether the Eucharist could be the true body of Christ without transubstantiation,\n#whether it needed to be given to the laity [[Communion under both kinds|under both kinds]],\n#whether [[Religious vows|vows]] of [[chastity]] needed to be observed as part of divine law,\n#whether clerical celibacy should be compulsory,\n#whether [[Votive Mass|private masses]] were required by divine law,\n#whether auricular [[Confession (religion)|confession]] (that is, confession to a priest) was necessary as part of divine law?{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 275}}{{sfn|Ridley|2013|p=180}}\n\nOver the next month, these questions were argued in Parliament and Convocation with the active participation of the King. The final product was an affirmation of traditional teachings on all questions. Communion in one kind, compulsory clerical celibacy, vows of chastity and votive masses were acceptable by divine law.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 153}} Protestants achieved a minor victory on auricular confession, which was declared \"expedient and necessary to be retained\" but not required by divine law. In addition, although the real presence was affirmed in traditional terminology, the word ''transubstantiation'' itself did not appear in the final version.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 275}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/act_six_articles.htm | title = The Act of the Six Articles | date = 1539 | website = tudorplace.com.ar | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180912225855/http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/act_six_articles.htm | archive-date = 2018-09-12 | url-status = live | access-date = 1 December 2018}}. The article on the Eucharist defines the real presence in these terms: \"First, that in the most blessed Sacrament of the Altar, by the strength and efficacy of Christ's mighty word, it being spoken by the priest, is present really, under the form of bread and wine, the natural body and blood of Our Saviour Jesu Christ, conceived of the Virgin Mary, and that after the consecration there remaineth no substance of bread and wine, nor any other substance but the substance of Christ, God and man\".</ref>\n\nThe Act of Six Articles became law in June 1539, which, unlike the Ten Articles, gave the Six Articles statutory authority. Harsh penalties were attached to violations of the Articles. Denial of transubstantiation was punished by burning without an opportunity to [[recant]]. Denial of any of the other articles was punished by hanging or life imprisonment.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 153}} Married priests had until 12 July to put away their wives, which was likely a concession granted to give Archbishop Cranmer time to move his wife and children outside of England.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=249}} After the act's passage, bishops Latimer and Shaxton, outspoken opponents of the measure, were forced to resign their dioceses.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=251}} The Act of Six Articles was repealed in 1547 during the reign of Henry's son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 312}}\n\n===''King's Book'' (1543)===\nWhen Parliament re-convened in April 1540, a committee was formed to revise the ''Bishops' Book'', which Henry VIII had never liked. The committee's membership included both traditionalists and reformers, but the former held the majority.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 279}} Convocation began discussing the revised text in April 1543. The ''King's Book'', or ''The Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for Any Christian Man'' to use its formal title, was more traditional than the 1537 version and incorporated many of the King's own revisions. It was approved by a [[Magnum Concilium|special meeting of the nobility]] on 6 May and differed from the ''Bishop's Book'' in having been issued under the King's authority. It was also statutorily enforced by the [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 160\u2013161}}\n\nSignificantly, the doctrine of justification by faith was totally rejected. Cranmer tried to save the doctrine by arguing that while true faith was accompanied by good works (in other words, faith was not ''alone'') it was only faith that justified. However, Henry would not be persuaded, and the text was amended to read that faith justified \"neither only nor alone\".{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 160}} It also stated that each person had free will to be \"a worker ... in the attaining of his own justification\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 288}} The ''King's Book'' also endorsed traditional views of the mass, transubstantiation, confession, and Church ceremonies.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 160}} The traditional seven sacraments were all included without any distinction in importance made between them. It was taught that the second commandment did not forbid images but only \"godly honour\" being given to them. Looking at images of Christ and the saints \"provoked, kindled and stirred to yield thanks to Our Lord\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 288\u2013289}}\n\nThe one area in which the ''King's Book'' moved away from traditional teaching was on prayer for the dead and purgatory. It taught that no one could know whether prayers or masses for the dead benefited an individual soul, and it was better to offer prayers for \"the universal congregation of Christian people, quick and dead\". People were encouraged to \"abstain from the name of purgatory, and no more dispute or reason thereof\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 289}} Presumably, the hostility towards purgatory derived from its connection to papal authority. The King's own behavior sent mixed signals. In 1540, he allowed offerings for the souls of deceased [[Knights of the Garter]] to be spent on works of charity instead of masses. At the same time, however, he required the new cathedral foundations to pray for the soul of [[Jane Seymour|Queen Jane]]. Perhaps due to the uncertainty surrounding this doctrine, bequests in wills for [[Chantry|chantries]], [[Obiit|obits]] and masses fell by half what they had been in the 1520s.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 289}}\n\n===Forty-two Articles (1553)===\n\nThe Forty-two Articles{{sfn|Bray|2004|p=284}} were intended to summarise [[Anglican]] doctrine, as it now existed under the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], who favoured a Protestant faith. Largely the work of Thomas Cranmer, they were to be short formularies that would demonstrate the faith revealed in [[Scripture]] and the existing ecumenical creeds.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=428}} Completed in 1552, they were issued by Royal Mandate on 19 June 1553.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} The articles were claimed to have received the authority of a Convocation, although this is doubtful.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=428}} With the coronation of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and the reunion of the Church of England with the Catholic Church, the Articles were never enforced.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} However, after Mary's death, they became the basis of the Thirty-nine Articles.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} In 1563, Convocation met under [[Matthew Parker|Archbishop Parker]] to revise the articles.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}} Convocation passed only 39 of the 42, and Elizabeth reduced the number to 38 by throwing out Article XXIX to avoid offending her subjects with Catholic leanings.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}} In 1571, the Article XXIX, despite the opposition of Bishop [[Edmund Gheast]], was inserted, to the effect that the wicked do not eat the Body of Christ.{{sfn|Wilson|Templeton|1962|p=}} This was done following the queen's [[excommunication]] by the [[Pope Pius V]] in 1570. That act destroyed any hope of reconciliation with Rome and it was no longer necessary to fear that Article XXIX would offend Catholic sensibilities.{{sfn|Wilson|Templeton|1962|p=}} The Articles, increased to Thirty-nine, were ratified by the Queen, and the bishops and clergy were required to assent.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}}\n\n==Content==\n[[Image:Elizabeth1England.jpg|right|thumb|Elizabeth I, in whose reign the Thirty-nine Articles were passed.]]\n\nThe Thirty-nine Articles were not intended as a complete statement of the Christian faith, but of the position of the Church of England in relation to the Catholic Church and dissident [[Protestants]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} The Articles argue against some [[Anabaptist]] positions such as the holding of [[Common ownership|goods in common]] and the necessity of [[believer's baptism]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} The motivation for their production and enactment was the absence of a general consensus on matters of faith following the separation from Rome.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} There was a concern that dissenters who wanted the reforms to go much further (for example, to abolish the three-fold ministry by eliminating bishops) would increase in influence. Wishing to pursue Elizabeth's agenda of establishing a national church that would maintain the indigenous [[apostolic succession|apostolic faith]] and incorporate some of the insights of Protestantism, the Articles were intended to incorporate a balance of theology and doctrine. This allowed them to appeal to the broadest domestic opinion, Catholic and otherwise.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} In this sense, the Articles are a revealing window into the ethos and character of Anglicanism, in particular in the way the document works to navigate a ''[[via media]]'' (\"middle path\") between the beliefs and practices of the Lutheran and of the Reformed churches, thus lending the Church of England a mainstream Reformed air. The \"via media\" was expressed so adroitly in the Articles that some Anglican scholars have labelled their content as an early example of the idea that the doctrine of Anglicanism is one of \"Reformed Catholicism\".{{sfn|Chadwick|1988|p=}} The Articles therefore state that there are only two [[sacrament]]s \u2013 baptism and communion \u2013 they reject the idea of [[transsubstantiation]] and clerical [[celibacy]], as well as the idea of [[purgatory]] and the possibility of [[indulgence]]s.\n\nThe Articles highlight the Anglican positions with regard to orthodox Catholic teachings, to [[Puritan]]ism, and to Anabaptist thought.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}}\nThey are divided, in compliance with the command of Queen Elizabeth, into four sections: Articles 1\u20138, \"The Catholic Faith\"; Articles 9\u201318, \"Personal Religion\"; Articles 19\u201331, \"Corporate Religion\"; and Articles 32\u201339, \"Miscellaneous.\"  The articles were issued both in English and in Latin, and both are of equal authority.\n\n'''Articles I\u2013VIII: The Catholic Articles''':\nThe first five articles articulate the Catholic credal statements concerning the nature of God, manifest in the [[Holy Trinity]]. Articles VI and VII deal with scripture, while Article VIII discusses the essential creeds.\n\n'''Articles IX\u2013XVIII: The Protestant and Reformed Articles''':\nThese articles dwell on the topics of [[sin]], [[justification (theology)|justification]], and the eternal disposition of the soul. Of particular focus is the major [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] topic of [[justification by faith]].\n\n'''Articles XIX\u2013XXXI: The Anglican Articles''':\nThis section focuses on the expression of faith in the public venue \u2013 the institutional church, the [[episcopal polity|councils of the church]], [[Christian worship|worship]], [[Anglican ministry|ministry]], and [[Anglican sacraments|sacramental theology]].\n\n'''Articles XXXII\u2013XXXIX: Miscellaneous''':\nThese articles concern [[clerical celibacy]], [[excommunication]], traditions of the Church, and other issues not covered elsewhere.\nArticle XXXVII additionally states among other things that the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]] has no jurisdiction in the realm of England.\n\n==Interpretation==\n\nIn 1628 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] prefixed a royal declaration to the articles, which demands a literal interpretation of them, threatening discipline for academics or churchmen teaching any personal interpretations or encouraging debate about them. It states: \"no man hereafter shall either print or preach, to draw the Article aside any way, but shall submit to it in the plain and Full meaning thereof: and shall not put his own sense or comment to be the meaning of the Article, but shall take it in the literal and grammatical sense.\"\n\nHowever, what the Articles truly mean has been a matter of debate in the Church since before they were issued. The [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] wing of the Church has taken the Articles at face value. In 2003, evangelical Anglican clergyman Chris Pierce wrote:\n\n{{quote|The Thirty-Nine Articles define the biblically derived summations of precise Christian doctrine. The Thirty-Nine Articles are more than minimally assented to; they are believed wholeheartedly. In earlier times English and Irish evangelicals would have read Cranmer, [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Ridley]], [[Hugh Latimer|Latimer]], [[James Ussher|Ussher]], and [[J. C. Ryle|Ryle]] and would unreservedly agree with Dean Litton's assessment that (quoted by Dean Paul Zahl, in his work 'The Protestant Face of Anglicanism'), 'The Anglican Church, if she is to be judged by the statements of the Articles, must be ranked among the Protestant Churches of Europe.'{{sfn|Pierce|2003}} }}\n\nThis view has never been held by the whole church. In 1643, [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] [[John Bramhall]] laid out the core argument against the Articles:\n\n{{quote|Some of them are the very same that are contained in the Creed; some others of them are practical truths, which come not within the proper list of points or articles to be believed; lastly, some of them are pious opinions or inferior truths, which are proposed by the Church of England to all her sons, as not to be opposed; not as essentials of Faith necessary to be believed by all Christians ''necessitate medii,'' under pain of damnation.{{sfn|Bramhall|1842|p=355}} }}\n\nThis divergence of opinion became overt during the [[Oxford Movement]] of the 19th century. The stipulations of Articles XXV and XXVIII were regularly invoked by evangelicals to oppose the reintroduction of certain beliefs, customs, and acts of piety with respect to the sacraments. In response, [[John Henry Newman]]'s [[Tract 90]] attempted to show that the 39 Articles could be read according to an [[Anglo-Catholic]] interpretation.{{sfn|Newman|1841|p=}}\n\n==History and influence==\n[[File:Book of Common Prayer 1760.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|''The Book of Common Prayer'' of 1662 included the Thirty-nine Articles.]]\nAdherence to the Articles was made a legal requirement by the English Parliament in 1571. They are printed in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and other Anglican prayer books. The [[Test Act]] of 1672 made adherence to the Articles a requirement for holding civil office in England until its repeal in 1828. Students at [[Oxford University]] were still expected to sign up to them until the passing of the [[Oxford University Act 1854]].\n\nIn the past, in numerous national churches and dioceses, those entering [[Holy Orders]] had to make an oath of subscription to the Articles. Clergy of the Church of England are required to affirm their loyalty to the Articles and other historic formularies (the Book of Common Prayer and the Ordering of Bishops, Priests and Deacons). The Church of Ireland has a similar declaration for its clergy, while some other churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] make no such requirement.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/files/worship/pdf/InstitutionHC.pdf|title=Institution of an Incumbent|pages=24|work=Book of Common Prayer|year=2004|publisher=[[Church of Ireland]]}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of the Articles on Anglican thought, doctrine and practice has been profound. Although Article VIII itself states that the three Catholic creeds are a sufficient statement of faith, the Articles have often been perceived as the nearest thing to a supplementary confession of faith possessed by the Anglican tradition.\n\nA revised version was adopted in 1801 by the US Episcopal Church which deleted the Athanasian Creed. Earlier, [[John Wesley]], founder of the [[Methodists]], adapted the Thirty-nine Articles for use by [[United Methodist Church|American Methodists]] in the 18th century. The resulting [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] remain official United Methodist doctrine.\n\nIn Anglican discourse, the Articles are regularly cited and interpreted to clarify doctrine and practice. Sometimes they are used to prescribe support of Anglican comprehensiveness. An important concrete manifestation of this is the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]], which incorporates Articles VI, VIII, XXV, and XXXVI in its broad articulation of fundamental Anglican identity. In other circumstances they delineate the parameters of acceptable belief and practice in proscriptive fashion.\n\nThe Articles continue to be invoked today in the Anglican Church. For example, in the ongoing debate over homosexual activity and the concomitant controversies over episcopal authority, Articles VI, XX, XXIII, XXVI, and XXXIV are regularly cited by those of various opinions.\n\nEach of the 44 member churches in the Anglican Communion is, however, free to adopt and authorise its own official documents, and the Articles are not officially normative in all Anglican Churches (neither is the [[Athanasian Creed]]). The only doctrinal documents agreed upon in the Anglican Communion are the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed of AD 325, and the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral. Beside these documents, authorised liturgical formularies, such as Prayer Book and Ordinal, are normative. The several provincial editions of Prayer Books (and authorised alternative liturgies) are, however, not identical, although they share a greater or smaller amount of family resemblance. No specific edition of the Prayer Book is therefore binding for the entire Communion.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n<!--\nUsing this template per Wikipedia:Citation templates\n{{cite news |first= |last= |author-link=  |title= |url= |format= |work= |publisher= |id= |pages= |page= |date= |access-date= |language= |quote= }}\n...OR...\n{{cite web |url= |title= |access-date=  |last= |first= |author-link= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= }}\n  ...OR...\n{{cite journal |last= |first=  |author-link= |coauthors=  |year= |month= |title= |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |access-date= |quote= |ref= harv }}\n ...OR....\n{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink=  |editor=  |title= |orig-date= |orig-year= |orig-month= |url= |format= |access-date= |edition= |series= |date= |year= |month= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |ch-apterurl= |quote= }}\n-->\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book | year =1993 | editor-last = Ayris | editor-first = Paul | editor2-last =Selwyn | editor2-first = David | title =Thomas Cranmer: Churchman and Scholar | place = Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK | publisher =[[Boydell & Brewer|The Boydell Press]] | isbn =0-85115-549-9 | ref =harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Blunt | first = John Henry | title = The Reformation of the Church of England: Its History, Principles and Results | publisher = Rivingtons | volume = Part 1 AD 1514\u20131547 | edition = 4th | year = 1878 | location = London, Oxford, and Cambridge | url = https://books.google.tt/books?id=M9UwAQAAMAAJ | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv|last=Bramhall|first=John |title=The Works of Archbishop Bramhall |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O10PAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA355|volume=Vol. 2|year=1842|publisher=J.H.

Articles''' or the '''XXXIX Articles''') are the historically defining statements of doctrines and practices of the [[Church of England]] with respect to the controversies of the [[English Reformation]].  The Thirty-nine Articles form part of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' used by both the Church of England and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\nWhen [[Henry VIII]] broke with the Catholic Church and was [[excommunication|excommunicated]], he began the reform of the Church of England, which would be [[Supreme Head of the Church of England|headed]] by the monarch (himself) rather than the pope. At this point, he needed to determine what its doctrines and practices would be in relation to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the new [[Protestantism|Protestant movements]] in continental Europe. A series of defining documents were written and replaced over a period of 30 years as the doctrinal and political situation changed from the excommunication of Henry VIII in 1533, to the [[excommunication of Elizabeth I]] in 1570.  These positions began with the Ten Articles in 1536, and concluded with the finalisation of the Thirty-nine articles in 1571. The Thirty-nine articles ultimately served to define the doctrine of the Church of England as it related to [[Calvinist]] doctrine and Roman Catholic practice.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=1622}}\n\nThe articles went through at least five major revisions prior to their finalisation in 1571. The first attempt was the Ten Articles in 1536, which showed some slightly Protestant leanings \u2013 the result of an English desire for a political alliance with the German [[Lutheran]] princes.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=}} The next revision was the Six Articles in 1539 which swung away from all reformed positions,{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=}} and then the ''King's Book'' in 1543, which re-established most of the earlier Roman Catholic doctrines. During the reign of [[Edward VI]], Henry VIII's only son, the Forty-two Articles were written under the direction of [[Archbishop]] [[Thomas Cranmer]] in 1552. It was in this document that Calvinist thought reached the zenith of its influence in the English Church. These articles were never put into action, due to Edward VI's death and the reversion of the English Church to Roman Catholicism under Henry VIII's elder daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].\n\nFinally, upon the coronation of Elizabeth I and the re-establishment of the Church of England as separate from the Roman Catholic Church, the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion were initiated by the [[Convocation of 1563]], under the direction of [[Matthew Parker]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The articles pulled back from some of the more extreme Calvinist thinking and created the distinctive English reformed doctrine.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=1622}}\n\nThe Thirty-nine Articles were finalised in 1571, and incorporated into the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. Although not the end of the struggle between Catholic and Protestant monarchs and citizens, the book helped to standardise the English language, and was to have a lasting effect on [[religion in the United Kingdom]] and elsewhere through its wide use.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1999|p=}}\n\n==Predecessors==\n===Ten Articles (1536)===\nThe [[Church of England]]'s break with Rome inaugurated a period of doctrinal confusion and controversy as both conservative and reforming clergy attempted to shape the church's direction, the former as \"[[Catholicism]] without the [[Pope]]\" and the latter as [[Protestant]]. In an attempt \"to establish Christian quietness and unity\", the Ten Articles were adopted by clerical [[Convocations of Canterbury and York|Convocation]] in July 1536 as the English Church's first post-papal doctrinal statement.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 238}} The Ten Articles were crafted as a rushed interim compromise between conservatives and reformers. Historians have variously described it as a victory for [[Lutheranism]] and a success for Catholic resistance.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 128}} Its provisions have also been described as \"confusing\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nThe first five articles dealt with doctrines that were \"commanded expressly by God, and are necessary to our [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]]\", while the last five articles dealt with \"laudable ceremonies used in the Church\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 238}}{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} This division reflects how the Articles originated from two different discussions earlier in the year. The first five articles were based on the Wittenberg Articles negotiated between English ambassadors [[Edward Foxe]], [[Nicholas Heath]] and [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]] and German Lutheran theologians, including [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]]. This doctrinal statement was itself based on the [[Augsburg Confession]] of 1530.{{Sfn | \"Wittenberg Articles\"}}{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}}\n\nThe five principal doctrines were the [[Bible]] and [[ecumenical creeds]], [[baptism]], [[penance]], the [[Eucharist]] and [[Justification (theology)|justification]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} The core doctrine in the Ten Articles was [[justification by faith]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 129}} Justification \u2013 which was defined as [[Forgiveness|remission]] of [[sin]] and accepting into God's favour \u2013 was through \"the only mercy and [[Grace in Christianity|grace]] of the [[God the Father|Father]], promised freely unto us for his Son\u2019s sake [[Jesus Christ]], and the merits of his [[Blood of Christ|blood]] and [[Passion of Jesus|passion]]\".{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} [[Good works]] would follow, not precede, justification. However, the Lutheran influence was diluted with qualifications. Justification was attained \"by [[Contrition|contrition]] and [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] joined with [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]\".{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 129}}  In other words, good works were \"necessarily required to the attaining of everlasting life\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nTo the disappointment of conservatives, only three of the traditional seven [[sacrament]]s were even mentioned (baptism, the Eucharist and penance).{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=161}} The Articles affirm the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], stating that \"under the form and figure of bread and wine ... is verily, substantially and really contained the very self-same body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} This definition was acceptable to those who held to [[transubstantiation]] or [[sacramental union]], but it clearly condemned [[sacramentarianism]]. More controversially for the reformers, the Articles maintained penance as a sacrament and the [[priest]]'s authority to grant divine [[absolution]] in [[Confession (religion)|confession]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 239}} \n\nArticles six through ten focused on secondary issues. Significantly, [[purgatory]], which had been a central concern of medieval religion, was placed in the non-essential articles. On the question of its existence, the Ten Articles were ambiguous. It stated, \"the place where [departed souls] be, the name thereof, and kind of pains there\" was \"uncertain by scripture\". [[Prayer for the dead]] and [[Requiem|masses for the dead]] were permitted as possibly relieving the pain of departed souls in purgatory.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 240}} \n\nThe Articles also defended the use of a number of Catholic rituals and practices opposed by Protestants, such as kissing the cross on [[Good Friday]], while mildly criticizing popular abuses and excesses. The use of [[Religious images in Christian theology|religious images]] was permitted, but people were to be taught not to kneel before them or make [[Votive offering|offerings]] to them. Prayer to [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], and all the other [[saint]]s was permitted as long as [[superstition]] was avoided.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 238\u2013239}} \n\nIn summary, the Ten Articles asserted:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reformationhenryviii.com/1536-ten-articles.html | title = Ten Articles 1536 | website = reformationhenryviii.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180803183730/http://www.reformationhenryviii.com/1536-ten-articles.html | archive-date = August 3, 2018 | url-status = live | access-date = August 3, 2018 | ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n# The Bible and the three ecumenical creeds are the basis and summary of true Christian faith.\n# Baptism imparts [[Forgiveness|remission of sins]] and [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and is necessary for salvation, even in the case of infants. It condemns the opinions of [[Anabaptist]]s and [[Pelagianism|Pelagians]] as [[heresy]]. \n# The sacrament of penance, with confession and absolution, is necessary to salvation.\n# That the body and blood of Christ are really present in the Eucharist.\n# Justification is by faith, but good works are necessary.\n# Images can be used as representations of virtue and good example and also to remind people of their sins but are not objects of worship.\n# Saints are to be honored as examples of life and as furthering the prayers of the faithful.\n# [[Intercession of saints|Praying to saints]] is permitted, and holy days should be observed.\n# The observance of various rites and ceremonies, such as clerical [[vestment]]s, sprinkling of [[holy water]], bearing of candles on [[Candlemas]], giving of ashes on [[Ash Wednesday]], is good and laudable. However, none of these has power to forgive sin. \n# It is a good and charitable deed to pray for the dead. However, the doctrine of purgatory is biblically uncertain. Abuses related to purgatory, such as the claim that papal [[indulgence]]s or masses for the dead offered at certain localities (such as the ''[[Santa Maria Scala Coeli|scala coeli]]'' mass) can deliver immediately from purgatory, are to be rejected.\n\n=== ''Bishops' Book'' (1537) ===\n\n[[Image:Thomas-Cranmer.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Thomas Cranmer]] headed the committee that authored the ''Bishop's Book''.]]\n\nThe failure of the Ten Articles to settle doctrinal controversy led [[Thomas Cromwell]], the King's [[vicegerent]] in spirituals, to convene a national [[synod]] of bishops and high-ranking clergy for further theological discussion in February 1537.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|pp=185\u2013186}} This synod produced a book called ''The Institution of the Christian Man'' (popularly called ''The Bishops' Book''), the word ''institution'' being synonymous with ''instruction''.{{Sfn| Blunt | 1878 | p = 444}} ''The Bishops' Book'' preserved the semi-Lutheranism of the Ten Articles, and the articles on justification, purgatory, and the sacraments of baptism, the Eucharist and penance were incorporated unchanged into the new book.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 255}}\n \nWhen the synod met, conservatives were still angry that four of the traditional seven sacraments ([[confirmation]], marriage, [[holy orders]] and [[extreme unction]]) had been excluded from the Ten Articles. [[John Stokesley]] argued for all seven, while [[Thomas Cranmer]] only acknowledged baptism and the Eucharist. The others divided along party lines. The conservatives were at a disadvantage because they found it necessary to appeal to [[sacred tradition]], which violated Cromwell's instructions that all arguments refer to scripture.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|pp=187\u2013188}} \n\nIn the end, the missing sacraments were restored but placed in a separate section to emphasize \"a difference in dignity and necessity.\" Only baptism, the Eucharist and penance were \"instituted of Christ, to be as certain instruments or remedies necessary for our salvation\".{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 254}} Confirmation was declared to have been introduced by the [[early Church]] in imitation of what they had read about the [[Christian laying on of hands|practice of the Apostles]].{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=189}} \n\nThe ''Bishops' Book'' also included expositions on the creed, the [[Ten Commandments]], the [[Lord's Prayer]] and [[Hail Mary]].{{Sfn| Blunt | 1878 | p = 446}} These were greatly influenced by [[William Marshall (translator)|William Marshall]]'s primer (lay [[Christian devotional literature|devotional]] book) of 1535, which itself was influenced by Luther's writings.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 256}} Following Marshall, ''The Bishops' Book'' rejected the traditional Catholic numbering of the Ten Commandments, in which the [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|prohibition on making and worshiping graven images]] was part of the first commandment, \"[[Thou shalt have no other gods before me]]\". In agreement with the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]]'s church at Zurich, the authors of the ''Bishops' Book'' adopted the Jewish tradition of separating these commandments. While allowing images of Christ and the saints, the exposition on the second commandment taught against representations of [[God the Father]] and criticised those who \"be more ready with their substance to deck dead images gorgeously and gloriously, than with the same to help poor Christian people, the quick and lively [[Image of God|images of God]]\".{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 256}} Such teachings encouraged [[iconoclasm]], which would become a feature of the English Reformation.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=192}} \n\nThe list of the 46 divines as they appear in the ''Bishop's Book'' included all of the [[bishop]]s, eight [[archdeacon]]s and 17 other [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctors of Divinity]], some of whom were later involved with translating the [[Great Bible|Bible]] and compiling the [[The Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]]:{{Sfn| Blunt | 1878 | p = 445}}\n\n[[Thomas Cranmer]] \u2013\n[[Edward Lee, Archbishop of York|Edward Lee]] \u2013\n[[John Stokesley]] \u2013\n[[Cuthbert Tunstall]] \u2013\n[[Stephen Gardiner]] \u2013\n[[Robert Aldrich, Bishop of Carlisle|Robert Aldrich]] \u2013\n[[John Voysey]] \u2013\n[[John Longland]] \u2013\n[[John Clerk, Bishop of Bath and Wells|John Clerk]] \u2013\n[[Rowland Lee]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Goodrich]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Shaxton]] \u2013\n[[John Bird (Bishop)|John Bird]] \u2013\n[[Edward Foxe]] \u2013\n[[Hugh Latimer]] \u2013\n[[John Hilsey]] \u2013\n[[Richard Sampson]] \u2013\n[[William Repps]] \u2013\n[[William Barlowe]] \u2013\n[[Robert Partew]] \u2013\n[[Robert Holgate]] \u2013\n[[Richard Wolman]] \u2013\n[[William Knight (royal servant)|William Knight]] \u2013\n[[John Bell, Bishop of Worcester|John Bell]] \u2013\n[[Edmund Bonner|Edmond Bonner]] \u2013\n[[William Skip]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Heath]] \u2013\n[[Cuthbert Marshal]] \u2013\n[[Richard Curren]] \u2013\n[[William Cliffe]] \u2013\n[[William Downes (divine)|William Downes]] \u2013\n[[Robert Oking]] \u2013\n[[Ralph Bradford]] \u2013\n[[Richard Smyth (Regius Professor)|Richard Smyth]] \u2013\n[[Simon Matthew]] \u2013\n[[John Pryn]] \u2013\n[[William Buckmaster]] \u2013\n[[William May (theologian)|William May]] \u2013\n[[Nicholas Wotton]] \u2013\n[[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]] \u2013\n[[John Edmunds (academic)|John Edmunds]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Robertson (divine)|Thomas Robertson]] \u2013\n[[John Baker (English statesman)|John Baker]] \u2013\n[[Thomas Barett]] \u2013\n[[John Hase]] \u2013\n[[John Tyson (divine)|John Tyson]]\n\nIn August 1537, it was presented to the King who ordered that parts should be read from the pulpit every Sunday and feast day. Nevertheless, the King was not entirely satisfied and took it upon himself to make a revised ''Bishops' Book'', which, among other proposed changes,<ref>{{Harvnb| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 257\u2013258}}: \"Most notoriously, [Henry VIII] took it upon himself to improve the wording of both the Ten Commandments and the Lord\u2019s Prayer. He wanted the final petition of the latter to read 'and suffer us not to be led into temptation' (rather than 'lead us not into temptation'). And he amended the First Commandment ('Thou shalt have none other gods but me') to read 'Thou shalt not have nor repute any other God, or gods, but me Jesu Christ.'\"</ref> weakened the original's emphasis on justification by faith. This revised version was never published, but the ''Bishops' Book'' would later be replaced with the ''King's Book''.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 259}}\n\n===Six Articles (1539)===\n[[File:The Act of Six Articles 1539.jpg|thumb|right|One of the final drafts of the Six articles (1539), amended in King Henry VIII's own hand]]\nFearful of diplomatic isolation and a Catholic alliance, Henry VIII continued his outreach to the Lutheran [[Schmalkaldic League]]. \nIn May 1538, three Lutheran theologians from Germany \u2013 Franz Burchard, vice-chancellor of Saxony; Georg von Boineburg, doctor of law; and [[Friedrich Myconius]], [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|superintendent]] of the church in [[Gotha]] \u2013 arrived in London and held conferences with English bishops and clergy at the archbishop's [[Lambeth Palace]] through September.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=215\u2013216}}: The English delegation included Cranmer, as chairman, and Nicholas Heath for the Protestant side. The conservatives included Bishops Sampson and Stokesley along with [[George Day (bishop)|George Day]] and [[Nicholas Wilson (parson)|Nicholas Wilson]]. Bishop Tunstall was involved in negotiations as well.</ref>\n\nThe Germans presented, as a basis of agreement, a number of articles based on the Lutheran Confession of Augsburg. Bishops [[Cuthbert Tunstall|Tunstall]], [[John Stokesley|Stokesley]] and others were not won over by these Protestant arguments and did everything they could to avoid agreement. They were willing to separate from Rome, but their plan was to unite with the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]] and not with the Protestants on the continent.{{sfn|D'Aubign\u00e9|1972|p=}} The bishops also refused to eliminate what the Germans considered abuses (e.g. private masses for the dead, compulsory [[clerical celibacy]], and withholding [[communion wine]] from the [[laity]]) allowed by the English Church.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=219}} Stokesley considered these customs to be essential because the Greek Church practised them.{{sfn|D'Aubign\u00e9|1972|p=}} As the King was unwilling to break with these practices, the Germans had all left England by 1 October.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=221}}\n\nMeanwhile, England was in religious turmoil. Impatient Protestants took it upon themselves to further reform \u2014 some priests said mass in English rather than Latin and married without authorisation (Archbishop Cranmer was himself secretly married). Protestants themselves were divided between establishment reformers who held Lutheran beliefs upholding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and radicals who held [[Anabaptist]] and [[Sacramentarian]] views denying real presence.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 269\u2013270}} In May 1539, a new Parliament met, and [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Audley]] told the [[House of Lords]] that the King desired religious uniformity. A committee of four conservative and four reformist bishops was appointed to examine and determine doctrine.<ref>{{Harvnb| Marshall | 2017 | p = 273}}: The committee was headed by Cromwell, the vicegerent, and the bishops included Cranmer and his Protestant allies \u2014 Latimer, Goodrich, Salcot \u2014 and their traditionalist counterparts Lee, Tunstall, Clerk and Robert Aldrich of Carlisle.</ref> On May 16, the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] noted that the committee had not agreed on anything and proposed that the Lords examine six controversial doctrinal questions that became the basis of the Six Articles:\n\n#whether the Eucharist could be the true body of Christ without transubstantiation,\n#whether it needed to be given to the laity [[Communion under both kinds|under both kinds]],\n#whether [[Religious vows|vows]] of [[chastity]] needed to be observed as part of divine law,\n#whether clerical celibacy should be compulsory,\n#whether [[Votive Mass|private masses]] were required by divine law,\n#whether auricular [[Confession (religion)|confession]] (that is, confession to a priest) was necessary as part of divine law?{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 275}}{{sfn|Ridley|2013|p=180}}\n\nOver the next month, these questions were argued in Parliament and Convocation with the active participation of the King. The final product was an affirmation of traditional teachings on all questions. Communion in one kind, compulsory clerical celibacy, vows of chastity and votive masses were acceptable by divine law.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 153}} Protestants achieved a minor victory on auricular confession, which was declared \"expedient and necessary to be retained\" but not required by divine law. In addition, although the real presence was affirmed in traditional terminology, the word ''transubstantiation'' itself did not appear in the final version.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 275}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/act_six_articles.htm | title = The Act of the Six Articles | date = 1539 | website = tudorplace.com.ar | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180912225855/http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/act_six_articles.htm | archive-date = 2018-09-12 | url-status = live | access-date = 1 December 2018}}. The article on the Eucharist defines the real presence in these terms: \"First, that in the most blessed Sacrament of the Altar, by the strength and efficacy of Christ's mighty word, it being spoken by the priest, is present really, under the form of bread and wine, the natural body and blood of Our Saviour Jesu Christ, conceived of the Virgin Mary, and that after the consecration there remaineth no substance of bread and wine, nor any other substance but the substance of Christ, God and man\".</ref>\n\nThe Act of Six Articles became law in June 1539, which, unlike the Ten Articles, gave the Six Articles statutory authority. Harsh penalties were attached to violations of the Articles. Denial of transubstantiation was punished by burning without an opportunity to [[recant]]. Denial of any of the other articles was punished by hanging or life imprisonment.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 153}} Married priests had until 12 July to put away their wives, which was likely a concession granted to give Archbishop Cranmer time to move his wife and children outside of England.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=249}} After the act's passage, bishops Latimer and Shaxton, outspoken opponents of the measure, were forced to resign their dioceses.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=251}} The Act of Six Articles was repealed in 1547 during the reign of Henry's son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 312}}\n\n===''King's Book'' (1543)===\nWhen Parliament re-convened in April 1540, a committee was formed to revise the ''Bishops' Book'', which Henry VIII had never liked. The committee's membership included both traditionalists and reformers, but the former held the majority.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 279}} Convocation began discussing the revised text in April 1543. The ''King's Book'', or ''The Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for Any Christian Man'' to use its formal title, was more traditional than the 1537 version and incorporated many of the King's own revisions. It was approved by a [[Magnum Concilium|special meeting of the nobility]] on 6 May and differed from the ''Bishop's Book'' in having been issued under the King's authority. It was also statutorily enforced by the [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 160\u2013161}}\n\nSignificantly, the doctrine of justification by faith was totally rejected. Cranmer tried to save the doctrine by arguing that while true faith was accompanied by good works (in other words, faith was not ''alone'') it was only faith that justified. However, Henry would not be persuaded, and the text was amended to read that faith justified \"neither only nor alone\".{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 160}} It also stated that each person had free will to be \"a worker ... in the attaining of his own justification\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 288}} The ''King's Book'' also endorsed traditional views of the mass, transubstantiation, confession, and Church ceremonies.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 160}} The traditional seven sacraments were all included without any distinction in importance made between them. It was taught that the second commandment did not forbid images but only \"godly honour\" being given to them. Looking at images of Christ and the saints \"provoked, kindled and stirred to yield thanks to Our Lord\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 288\u2013289}}\n\nThe one area in which the ''King's Book'' moved away from traditional teaching was on prayer for the dead and purgatory. It taught that no one could know whether prayers or masses for the dead benefited an individual soul, and it was better to offer prayers for \"the universal congregation of Christian people, quick and dead\". People were encouraged to \"abstain from the name of purgatory, and no more dispute or reason thereof\".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 289}} Presumably, the hostility towards purgatory derived from its connection to papal authority. The King's own behavior sent mixed signals. In 1540, he allowed offerings for the souls of deceased [[Knights of the Garter]] to be spent on works of charity instead of masses. At the same time, however, he required the new cathedral foundations to pray for the soul of [[Jane Seymour|Queen Jane]]. Perhaps due to the uncertainty surrounding this doctrine, bequests in wills for [[Chantry|chantries]], [[Obiit|obits]] and masses fell by half what they had been in the 1520s.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 289}}\n\n===Forty-two Articles (1553)===\n\nThe Forty-two Articles{{sfn|Bray|2004|p=284}} were intended to summarise [[Anglican]] doctrine, as it now existed under the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], who favoured a Protestant faith. Largely the work of Thomas Cranmer, they were to be short formularies that would demonstrate the faith revealed in [[Scripture]] and the existing ecumenical creeds.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=428}} Completed in 1552, they were issued by Royal Mandate on 19 June 1553.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} The articles were claimed to have received the authority of a Convocation, although this is doubtful.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=428}} With the coronation of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and the reunion of the Church of England with the Catholic Church, the Articles were never enforced.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} However, after Mary's death, they became the basis of the Thirty-nine Articles.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=625}} In 1563, Convocation met under [[Matthew Parker|Archbishop Parker]] to revise the articles.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}} Convocation passed only 39 of the 42, and Elizabeth reduced the number to 38 by throwing out Article XXIX to avoid offending her subjects with Catholic leanings.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}} In 1571, the Article XXIX, despite the opposition of Bishop [[Edmund Gheast]], was inserted, to the effect that the wicked do not eat the Body of Christ.{{sfn|Wilson|Templeton|1962|p=}} This was done following the queen's [[excommunication]] by the [[Pope Pius V]] in 1570. That act destroyed any hope of reconciliation with Rome and it was no longer necessary to fear that Article XXIX would offend Catholic sensibilities.{{sfn|Wilson|Templeton|1962|p=}} The Articles, increased to Thirty-nine, were ratified by the Queen, and the bishops and clergy were required to assent.{{sfn|Moyes|1913}}\n\n==Content==\n[[Image:Elizabeth1England.jpg|right|thumb|Elizabeth I, in whose reign the Thirty-nine Articles were passed.]]\n\nThe Thirty-nine Articles were not intended as a complete statement of the Christian faith, but of the position of the Church of England in relation to the Catholic Church and dissident [[Protestants]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} The Articles argue against some [[Anabaptist]] positions such as the holding of [[Common ownership|goods in common]] and the necessity of [[believer's baptism]].{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} The motivation for their production and enactment was the absence of a general consensus on matters of faith following the separation from Rome.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} There was a concern that dissenters who wanted the reforms to go much further (for example, to abolish the three-fold ministry by eliminating bishops) would increase in influence. Wishing to pursue Elizabeth's agenda of establishing a national church that would maintain the indigenous [[apostolic succession|apostolic faith]] and incorporate some of the insights of Protestantism, the Articles were intended to incorporate a balance of theology and doctrine. This allowed them to appeal to the broadest domestic opinion, Catholic and otherwise.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}} In this sense, the Articles are a revealing window into the ethos and character of Anglicanism, in particular in the way the document works to navigate a ''[[via media]]'' (\"middle path\") between the beliefs and practices of the Lutheran and of the Reformed churches, thus lending the Church of England a mainstream Reformed air. The \"via media\" was expressed so adroitly in the Articles that some Anglican scholars have labelled their content as an early example of the idea that the doctrine of Anglicanism is one of \"Reformed Catholicism\".{{sfn|Chadwick|1988|p=}} The Articles therefore state that there are only two [[sacrament]]s \u2013 baptism and communion \u2013 they reject the idea of [[transsubstantiation]] and clerical [[celibacy]], as well as the idea of [[purgatory]] and the possibility of [[indulgence]]s.\n\nThe Articles highlight the Anglican positions with regard to orthodox Catholic teachings, to [[Puritan]]ism, and to Anabaptist thought.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}}\nThey are divided, in compliance with the command of Queen Elizabeth, into four sections: Articles 1\u20138, \"The Catholic Faith\"; Articles 9\u201318, \"Personal Religion\"; Articles 19\u201331, \"Corporate Religion\"; and Articles 32\u201339, \"Miscellaneous.\"  The articles were issued both in English and in Latin, and both are of equal authority.\n\n'''Articles I\u2013VIII: The Catholic Articles''':\nThe first five articles articulate the Catholic credal statements concerning the nature of God, manifest in the [[Holy Trinity]]. Articles VI and VII deal with scripture, while Article VIII discusses the essential creeds.\n\n'''Articles IX\u2013XVIII: The Protestant and Reformed Articles''':\nThese articles dwell on the topics of [[sin]], [[justification (theology)|justification]], and the eternal disposition of the soul. Of particular focus is the major [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] topic of [[justification by faith]].\n\n'''Articles XIX\u2013XXXI: The Anglican Articles''':\nThis section focuses on the expression of faith in the public venue \u2013 the institutional church, the [[episcopal polity|councils of the church]], [[Christian worship|worship]], [[Anglican ministry|ministry]], and [[Anglican sacraments|sacramental theology]].\n\n'''Articles XXXII\u2013XXXIX: Miscellaneous''':\nThese articles concern [[clerical celibacy]], [[excommunication]], traditions of the Church, and other issues not covered elsewhere.\nArticle XXXVII additionally states among other things that the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]] has no jurisdiction in the realm of England.\n\n==Interpretation==\n\nIn 1628 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] prefixed a royal declaration to the articles, which demands a literal interpretation of them, threatening discipline for academics or churchmen teaching any personal interpretations or encouraging debate about them. It states: \"no man hereafter shall either print or preach, to draw the Article aside any way, but shall submit to it in the plain and Full meaning thereof: and shall not put his own sense or comment to be the meaning of the Article, but shall take it in the literal and grammatical sense.\"\n\nHowever, what the Articles truly mean has been a matter of debate in the Church since before they were issued. The [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] wing of the Church has taken the Articles at face value. In 2003, evangelical Anglican clergyman Chris Pierce wrote:\n\n{{quote|The Thirty-Nine Articles define the biblically derived summations of precise Christian doctrine. The Thirty-Nine Articles are more than minimally assented to; they are believed wholeheartedly. In earlier times English and Irish evangelicals would have read Cranmer, [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Ridley]], [[Hugh Latimer|Latimer]], [[James Ussher|Ussher]], and [[J. C. Ryle|Ryle]] and would unreservedly agree with Dean Litton's assessment that (quoted by Dean Paul Zahl, in his work 'The Protestant Face of Anglicanism'), 'The Anglican Church, if she is to be judged by the statements of the Articles, must be ranked among the Protestant Churches of Europe.'{{sfn|Pierce|2003}} }}\n\nThis view has never been held by the whole church. In 1643, [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] [[John Bramhall]] laid out the core argument against the Articles:\n\n{{quote|Some of them are the very same that are contained in the Creed; some others of them are practical truths, which come not within the proper list of points or articles to be believed; lastly, some of them are pious opinions or inferior truths, which are proposed by the Church of England to all her sons, as not to be opposed; not as essentials of Faith necessary to be believed by all Christians ''necessitate medii,'' under pain of damnation.{{sfn|Bramhall|1842|p=355}} }}\n\nThis divergence of opinion became overt during the [[Oxford Movement]] of the 19th century. The stipulations of Articles XXV and XXVIII were regularly invoked by evangelicals to oppose the reintroduction of certain beliefs, customs, and acts of piety with respect to the sacraments. In response, [[John Henry Newman]]'s [[Tract 90]] attempted to show that the 39 Articles could be read according to an [[Anglo-Catholic]] interpretation.{{sfn|Newman|1841|p=}}\n\n==History and influence==\n[[File:Book of Common Prayer 1760.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|''The Book of Common Prayer'' of 1662 included the Thirty-nine Articles.]]\nAdherence to the Articles was made a legal requirement by the English Parliament in 1571. They are printed in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and other Anglican prayer books. The [[Test Act]] of 1672 made adherence to the Articles a requirement for holding civil office in England until its repeal in 1828. Students at [[Oxford University]] were still expected to sign up to them until the passing of the [[Oxford University Act 1854]].\n\nIn the past, in numerous national churches and dioceses, those entering [[Holy Orders]] had to make an oath of subscription to the Articles. Clergy of the Church of England are required to affirm their loyalty to the Articles and other historic formularies (the Book of Common Prayer and the Ordering of Bishops, Priests and Deacons). The Church of Ireland has a similar declaration for its clergy, while some other churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] make no such requirement.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/files/worship/pdf/InstitutionHC.pdf|title=Institution of an Incumbent|pages=24|work=Book of Common Prayer|year=2004|publisher=[[Church of Ireland]]}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of the Articles on Anglican thought, doctrine and practice has been profound. Although Article VIII itself states that the three Catholic creeds are a sufficient statement of faith, the Articles have often been perceived as the nearest thing to a supplementary confession of faith possessed by the Anglican tradition.\n\nA revised version was adopted in 1801 by the US Episcopal Church which deleted the Athanasian Creed. Earlier, [[John Wesley]], founder of the [[Methodists]], adapted the Thirty-nine Articles for use by [[United Methodist Church|American Methodists]] in the 18th century. The resulting [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] remain official United Methodist doctrine.\n\nIn Anglican discourse, the Articles are regularly cited and interpreted to clarify doctrine and practice. Sometimes they are used to prescribe support of Anglican comprehensiveness. An important concrete manifestation of this is the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]], which incorporates Articles VI, VIII, XXV, and XXXVI in its broad articulation of fundamental Anglican identity. In other circumstances they delineate the parameters of acceptable belief and practice in proscriptive fashion.\n\nThe Articles continue to be invoked today in the Anglican Church. For example, in the ongoing debate over homosexual activity and the concomitant controversies over episcopal authority, Articles VI, XX, XXIII, XXVI, and XXXIV are regularly cited by those of various opinions.\n\nEach of the 44 member churches in the Anglican Communion is, however, free to adopt and authorise its own official documents, and the Articles are not officially normative in all Anglican Churches (neither is the [[Athanasian Creed]]). The only doctrinal documents agreed upon in the Anglican Communion are the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed of AD 325, and the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral. Beside these documents, authorised liturgical formularies, such as Prayer Book and Ordinal, are normative. The several provincial editions of Prayer Books (and authorised alternative liturgies) are, however, not identical, although they share a greater or smaller amount of family resemblance. No specific edition of the Prayer Book is therefore binding for the entire Communion.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n<!--\nUsing this template per Wikipedia:Citation templates\n{{cite news |first= |last= |author-link=  |title= |url= |format= |work= |publisher= |id= |pages= |page= |date= |access-date= |language= |quote= }}\n...OR...\n{{cite web |url= |title= |access-date=  |last= |first= |author-link= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= }}\n  ...OR...\n{{cite journal |last= |first=  |author-link= |coauthors=  |year= |month= |title= |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |access-date= |quote= |ref= harv }}\n ...OR....\n{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink=  |editor=  |title= |orig-date= |orig-year= |orig-month= |url= |format= |access-date= |edition= |series= |date= |year= |month= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |ch-apterurl= |quote= }}\n-->\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book | year =1993 | editor-last = Ayris | editor-first = Paul | editor2-last =Selwyn | editor2-first = David | title =Thomas Cranmer: Churchman and Scholar | place = Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK | publisher =[[Boydell & Brewer|The Boydell Press]] | isbn =0-85115-549-9 | ref =harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Blunt | first = John Henry | title = The Reformation of the Church of England: Its History, Principles and Results | publisher = Rivingtons | volume = Part 1 AD 1514\u20131547 | edition = 4th | year = 1878 | location = London, Oxford, and Cambridge | url = https://books.google.tt/books?id=M9UwAQAAMAAJ | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv|last=Bramhall|first=John |title=The Works of Archbishop Bramhall |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O10PAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA355|volume=Vol. 2|year=1842|publisher=J.H.

In his [[will (law)|will]] dated 8 July 1557, he left the property and [[financial endowment|endowments]] towards establishing the school.\n\nThe will had left the property to his brother [[William Glyn (1504-1558)|William Glyn]], [[Bishop of Bangor]] and [[Maurice Griffith]], [[Bishop of Rochester]] to execute his wishes. Unfortunately both of these were to die in the following year,<ref>Barber & Lewis (1901), p.20</ref> but they further transferred the will to Sir [[William Petre]], a former [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], Sir [[William Garrard]], a former [[Lord Mayor of London]] and [[Simon Lowe alias Fyfield|Simon Lowe]], a London merchant tailor, who were able to execute Geoffrey Glyn's intentions.<ref name = WOW30>W.

The school was to be known as ''The free grammar school of Geoffrey Glyn, Doctor of Laws'', but because of the connection with the Black Friars, later became known as \"Friars School\". The letters patent established the [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] and Chapter of [[Bangor Cathedral]] as the corporation to govern the school. In 1568, statutes were adopted to regulate the schools, based closely on the statutes of [[King Edward VI School (Bury St Edmunds)|Bury St. Edmunds School]] in Suffolk, founded a few years earlier.<ref name = WOW30 /><ref>Clarke (1955)</ref>\n\nThe school has been established to provide a free grammar school education for the boys of the poor. This comprised a [[Classics|classical education]], in [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] only.<ref>W. Ogwen Williams in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), pp.34\u201336</ref> The children who benefited were not the most poor, but the middle class preparing for a career in the ministry or the law like Geoffrey Glyn himself.\n\nThe school was maintained from income on the endowments left by Geoffrey Glyn and later benefactors, mainly rents on land in [[Southwark]] and a rent charge on land in [[Oswestry]] purchased using money left by Glyn.<ref>W. Ogwen Williams in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.29</ref>\n\nThe school continued in the old friary, close to the banks of the [[River Adda (Wales)|River Adda]] for over two centuries <small>(at {{Coord|53.231|-4.124|display=inline|format=dms|region:GB_type:edu|name=Friars School 1557 site}})</small>.\n\n===The second building, 1789===\n[[File:Friars-barber&lewis1789.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friars School building of 1789 to 1900]]\nUnder the patronage of [[John Warren (bishop)|John Warren]], [[Bishop of Bangor]] \u2013 a colourful and controversial character \u2013 the school was transferred to a better site, a little further from the river. This was financed partly by closing the school in 1786, an accumulating the money saved from the endowment for a building fund. The new school was built for \u00a32,076 12s 5\u00bdd, and opened in 1789 on a site <small> (at {{Coord|53.230|-4.122|display=inline|format=dms|type:edu|name=Friars School 1789 site}})</small>, all closer to the High Street and the present Glynne Road.<ref>[[Aled Eames]] in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.58</ref>\n\nThe curriculum slowly developed to include mathematics, writing and other subject more familiar to today's school students.\n\nThe school's fortunes were varied. The move boosted the school. But by the middle of the 19th century, under the headship of Totton, the schools\u2019 reputation suffered, and ultimately lost so many pupils that it was forced to close in 1861.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), pp.66\u201368</ref> It re-opened in 1866 and a new headmaster, [[Daniel Lewis Lloyd|Lewis Lloyd]] appointed in 1872, when a new secular governing body was introduced in place of the Dean and Chapter.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.70</ref>\n\nIn 1881, an epidemic of [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]] in Bangor caused the school to move to [[Penmaenmawr]] to avoid the disease.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.73</ref> The bottom of the valley, especially close to the river, was unhygienic, and this episode engendered consideration of moving away to a fresh site.\n\nAt this time, too, the [[Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889]] introduced a state system of secondary education in Wales. Some charity and private schools were exempted from its provisions and there had been advocates for Friars, too, to be exempted, but ultimately this brought Friars School into the state system, under [[Caernarfonshire]] [[County council]].<ref name = AE74>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.74</ref>\n\n===The third building, 1900===\n[[File:Friars-ffriddoedd.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friars School Ffriddoedd building, site of the school 1900\u20131999]]\nWith contributions from Caernarfonshire County Council, the proceeds of selling the old site, together with a public appeal for funds, a new school was built on Ffriddoedd Road for a cost of \u00a311,600. The architect was [[John Douglas, architect (1830-1911)|John Douglas]] of Douglas & Minishull, and builders Messrs. James Hamilton & son of [[Altrincham]]. A foundation stone was laid by [[Watkin Herbert Williams]], [[Bishop of Bangor]] on 12 April 1899, and the building was opened in December 1900 <small>(at {{Coord|53.2234|-4.1437|display=inline|format=dms|type:edu|name=Friars School 1900 site}})</small>.<ref name = AE74 />\n\nIn moving to the Ffriddoedd site, the intention had been to move out to the countryside. After the typhoid outbreak, and with the unsanitary condition of the lower Adda valley, Ffriddoedd was seen as a healthy rural alternative. However, the development of the city was to catch up. To preserve a little of that rural idyll as the area developed, Dr. R. L. Archer, a former Chairman of the Governors, in 1955 bequeathed to the school a small plot of land. Known as \"Dr. Archer's plot\", this was to be planted with flowers and kept for ever green.<ref>\u2019Recitation of Benefactors, Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving\u2019 (1957), Friars School</ref>\n\nIn 1957, several events commemorated the fourth centenary of the school.

As a grammar school, education was selective, boys having to pass the [[eleven plus exam]] to gain admission.\n\nA significant reorganisation in 1971 combined three schools \u2013 Friars School, the Bangor County School for Girls (also a grammar school), and Deiniol School, a co-educational [[Secondary modern school]]. The three schools brought together formed a new [[comprehensive school]], under the Friars name, but on three sites. The former girls\u2019 school became the Tryfan site, a [[Welsh language]] medium for the lower years, while the Ffriddoedd building was the location of the English language medium lower years. The senior years came together at a new building, built for \u00a3300,000<ref name = Dominican71>''The Dominican'', Summer Term 1971, Friars School</ref> on a new site at Eithinog.\n\nA further reorganisation in 1978 split the school in two: [[Ysgol Tryfan]] was formed as an 11\u201318 Welsh medium school on the Tryfan site. Friars School became a mainly English-medium school on Ffriddoedd and Eithinog sites.\n\nShoddy building practices of the 1960s meant that the Eithinog building had to be almost completely rebuilt over the following few decades. These were gradually replaced and expanded, until the whole school was able to relocate to Eithinog in 1999. The final contract for completing the school was valued at \u00a35.4 million.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.claw.gov.uk/uploads/media/CLAW_Annual_Report-01.pdf | title = CLAW Annual Report, 2001 | author = CLAW | year = 2001 | accessdate = 15 August 2007 |url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006215354/http://www.claw.gov.uk/uploads/media/CLAW_Annual_Report-01.pdf | archivedate = 6 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn that year, the former Friars building at Ffriddoedd was sold to further education college [[Coleg Menai]] and continues in educational use.<ref name = civic />\n\n===Celebrating 450 years===\nA Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving was held in [[Bangor Cathedral]] in April 2007 to mark 450 years of Friars School.<ref>{{cite news\n | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6574755.stm\n | title = BBC News article | accessdate = 22 April 2007\n | author = BBC | date=20 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n==The modern school==\nSince 1999, the present school has been united on the Eithinog site.\n\nIt is a comprehensive school for the 11\u201318 age group, and draws pupils from a wide area around [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]].

In his [[will (law)|will]] dated 8 July 1557, he left the property and [[financial endowment|endowments]] towards establishing the school.\n\nThe will had left the property to his brother [[William Glyn (1504-1558)|William Glyn]], [[Bishop of Bangor]] and [[Maurice Griffith]], [[Bishop of Rochester]] to execute his wishes. Unfortunately both of these were to die in the following year,<ref>Barber & Lewis (1901), p.20</ref> but they further transferred the will to Sir [[William Petre]], a former [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], Sir [[William Garrard]], a former [[Lord Mayor of London]] and [[Simon Lowe alias Fyfield|Simon Lowe]], a London merchant tailor, who were able to execute Geoffrey Glyn's intentions.<ref name = WOW30>W.

The school was to be known as ''The free grammar school of Geoffrey Glyn, Doctor of Laws'', but because of the connection with the Black Friars, later became known as \"Friars School\". The letters patent established the [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] and Chapter of [[Bangor Cathedral]] as the corporation to govern the school. In 1568, statutes were adopted to regulate the schools, based closely on the statutes of [[King Edward VI School (Bury St Edmunds)|Bury St. Edmunds School]] in Suffolk, founded a few years earlier.<ref name = WOW30 /><ref>Clarke (1955)</ref>\n\nThe school has been established to provide a free grammar school education for the boys of the poor. This comprised a [[Classics|classical education]], in [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] only.<ref>W. Ogwen Williams in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), pp.34\u201336</ref> The children who benefited were not the most poor, but the middle class preparing for a career in the ministry or the law like Geoffrey Glyn himself.\n\nThe school was maintained from income on the endowments left by Geoffrey Glyn and later benefactors, mainly rents on land in [[Southwark]] and a rent charge on land in [[Oswestry]] purchased using money left by Glyn.<ref>W. Ogwen Williams in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.29</ref>\n\nThe school continued in the old friary, close to the banks of the [[River Adda (Wales)|River Adda]] for over two centuries <small>(at {{Coord|53.231|-4.124|display=inline|format=dms|region:GB_type:edu|name=Friars School 1557 site}})</small>.\n\n===The second building, 1789===\n[[File:Friars-barber&lewis1789.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friars School building of 1789 to 1900]]\nUnder the patronage of [[John Warren (bishop)|John Warren]], [[Bishop of Bangor]] \u2013 a colourful and controversial character \u2013 the school was transferred to a better site, a little further from the river. This was financed partly by closing the school in 1786, an accumulating the money saved from the endowment for a building fund. The new school was built for \u00a32,076 12s 5\u00bdd, and opened in 1789 on a site <small> (at {{Coord|53.230|-4.122|display=inline|format=dms|type:edu|name=Friars School 1789 site}})</small>, all closer to the High Street and the present Glynne Road.<ref>[[Aled Eames]] in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.58</ref>\n\nThe curriculum slowly developed to include mathematics, writing and other subject more familiar to today's school students.\n\nThe school's fortunes were varied. The move boosted the school. But by the middle of the 19th century, under the headship of Totton, the schools\u2019 reputation suffered, and ultimately lost so many pupils that it was forced to close in 1861.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), pp.66\u201368</ref> It re-opened in 1866 and a new headmaster, [[Daniel Lewis Lloyd|Lewis Lloyd]] appointed in 1872, when a new secular governing body was introduced in place of the Dean and Chapter.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.70</ref>\n\nIn 1881, an epidemic of [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]] in Bangor caused the school to move to [[Penmaenmawr]] to avoid the disease.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.73</ref> The bottom of the valley, especially close to the river, was unhygienic, and this episode engendered consideration of moving away to a fresh site.\n\nAt this time, too, the [[Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889]] introduced a state system of secondary education in Wales. Some charity and private schools were exempted from its provisions and there had been advocates for Friars, too, to be exempted, but ultimately this brought Friars School into the state system, under [[Caernarfonshire]] [[County council]].<ref name = AE74>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.74</ref>\n\n===The third building, 1900===\n[[File:Friars-ffriddoedd.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friars School Ffriddoedd building, site of the school 1900\u20131999]]\nWith contributions from Caernarfonshire County Council, the proceeds of selling the old site, together with a public appeal for funds, a new school was built on Ffriddoedd Road for a cost of \u00a311,600. The architect was [[John Douglas, architect (1830-1911)|John Douglas]] of Douglas & Minishull, and builders Messrs. James Hamilton & son of [[Altrincham]].

After the typhoid outbreak, and with the unsanitary condition of the lower Adda valley, Ffriddoedd was seen as a healthy rural alternative. However, the development of the city was to catch up. To preserve a little of that rural idyll as the area developed, Dr. R. L. Archer, a former Chairman of the Governors, in 1955 bequeathed to the school a small plot of land. Known as \"Dr. Archer's plot\", this was to be planted with flowers and kept for ever green.<ref>\u2019Recitation of Benefactors, Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving\u2019 (1957), Friars School</ref>\n\nIn 1957, several events commemorated the fourth centenary of the school.

As a grammar school, education was selective, boys having to pass the [[eleven plus exam]] to gain admission.\n\nA significant reorganisation in 1971 combined three schools \u2013 Friars School, the Bangor County School for Girls (also a grammar school), and Deiniol School, a co-educational [[Secondary modern school]]. The three schools brought together formed a new [[comprehensive school]], under the Friars name, but on three sites. The former girls\u2019 school became the Tryfan site, a [[Welsh language]] medium for the lower years, while the Ffriddoedd building was the location of the English language medium lower years. The senior years came together at a new building, built for \u00a3300,000<ref name = Dominican71>''The Dominican'', Summer Term 1971, Friars School</ref> on a new site at Eithinog.\n\nA further reorganisation in 1978 split the school in two: [[Ysgol Tryfan]] was formed as an 11\u201318 Welsh medium school on the Tryfan site. Friars School became a mainly English-medium school on Ffriddoedd and Eithinog sites.\n\nShoddy building practices of the 1960s meant that the Eithinog building had to be almost completely rebuilt over the following few decades. These were gradually replaced and expanded, until the whole school was able to relocate to Eithinog in 1999. The final contract for completing the school was valued at \u00a35.4 million.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.claw.gov.uk/uploads/media/CLAW_Annual_Report-01.pdf | title = CLAW Annual Report, 2001 | author = CLAW | year = 2001 | accessdate = 15 August 2007 |url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006215354/http://www.claw.gov.uk/uploads/media/CLAW_Annual_Report-01.pdf | archivedate = 6 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn that year, the former Friars building at Ffriddoedd was sold to further education college [[Coleg Menai]] and continues in educational use.<ref name = civic />\n\n===Celebrating 450 years===\nA Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving was held in [[Bangor Cathedral]] in April 2007 to mark 450 years of Friars School.<ref>{{cite news\n | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6574755.stm\n | title = BBC News article | accessdate = 22 April 2007\n | author = BBC | date=20 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n==The modern school==\nSince 1999, the present school has been united on the Eithinog site.\n\nIt is a comprehensive school for the 11\u201318 age group, and draws pupils from a wide area around [[Bangor]].

It comprises most of the languages of Europe together with those of the northern [[Indian Subcontinent]] and the [[Iranian Plateau]]. A few of these languages, such as English, have expanded through [[colonialism]] in the modern period and are now spoken across all continents. The Indo-European family is divided into several branches or sub-families, the largest of which are the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], and [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] groups. The most populous individual languages within them are [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], each with over 100 million speakers. [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Persian language|Persian]] have more than 50 million each. In total, 46% of the world's population (3.2 billion) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language, by far the highest of any language family. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by ''[[Ethnologue]]'', with over two thirds (313) of them belonging to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian branch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=2-16|title=Ethnologue report for Indo-European|publisher=Ethnologue.com}}</ref> \n\nAll Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language, [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], spoken sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era. Its precise geographical location, the Indo-European [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|''urheimat'']], is unknown and has been the object of many competing hypotheses. By the time the first written records appeared, Indo-European had already spread out into a large number of languages spoken across much of Europe and south-west Asia. Written evidence of Indo-European appeared during the [[Bronze Age]] in the form of [[Mycenaean Greek]] and the [[Anatolian languages]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]]. The oldest records are isolated Hittite words and names \u2013 interspersed in texts that are otherwise in the unrelated [[Akkadian language|Old Assyrian]] language, a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] language \u2013 found in the texts of the Assyrian colony of [[K\u00fcltepe]] in eastern Anatolia in the 20th century BC.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bryce |first=Trevor |date= 2005|title=Kingdom of the Hittites: New Edition |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=37 |isbn=978-0-19-928132-9 |access-date= }}</ref> Although no older written records of the original [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] remain, some aspects of their culture and [[Proto-Indo-European religion|religion]] can be reconstructed from later evidence in the daughter cultures.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|last=Mallory|first=J.

The analysis of the family relationships between the Indo-European languages and the reconstruction of their common source was central to the development of the methodology of historical linguistics as an academic discipline in the 19th century.\n\nThe Indo-European family is not known to be linked to any other language family through any more distant genetic relationship, although several [[#Suggested macrofamilies|disputed proposals]] to that effect have been made. \n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the linguistic concept of Indo-European languages was frequently used interchangeably with the racial concepts of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] and [[Japhetite]].<ref name=\"Kidd2006\">{{cite book|author=Colin Kidd|title=The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600\u20132000|url={{Google books|aNT3q1HjY_MC|page=PA23|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45753-8|pages=23\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==History of Indo-European linguistics==\n{{See also|Indo-European studies#History}}\nIn the 16th century, European visitors to the [[Indian subcontinent]] began to notice similarities among [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], and [[languages of Europe|European]] languages.

Membership in the various branches, groups and subgroups of Indo-European is also genealogical, but here the defining factors are ''shared innovations'' among various languages, suggesting a common ancestor that split off from other Indo-European groups. For example, what makes the Germanic languages a branch of Indo-European is that much of their structure and phonology can be stated in rules that apply to all of them. Many of their common features are presumed innovations that took place in [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], the source of all the Germanic languages.\n\n===Tree versus wave model===\n{{See also|Language change}}\nThe \"[[tree model]]\" is considered an appropriate representation of the genealogical history of a language family if communities do not remain in contact after their languages have started to diverge. In this case, subgroups defined by shared innovations form a nested pattern. The tree model is not appropriate in cases where languages remain in contact as they diversify; in such cases subgroups may overlap, and the \"[[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]]\" is a more accurate representation.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Fran\u00e7ois\n  | first = Alexandre\n  | contribution = Trees, Waves and Linkages: Models of Language Diversification\n  | editor1-last = Bowern\n  | editor1-first = Claire\n  | editor2-last = Evans\n  | editor2-first = Bethwyn\n  | title = The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics\n  | series=\n  | pages = 161\u201389\n  | publisher = Routledge\n  | place = London\n  | year = 2014\n  | isbn = 978-0-415-52789-7\n  | contribution-url = http://alex.francois.free.fr/data/AlexFrancois_2014_HHL_Trees-waves-linkages_Diversification.pdf\n  | ref = francois\n }}</ref> Most approaches to Indo-European subgrouping to date have assumed that the tree model is by-and-large valid for Indo-European;<ref>{{cite journal | title= From August Schleicher to Sergei Starostin: on the development of the tree-diagram models of the Indo-European languages | author= Bla\u017eek, V\u00e1clav | journal= Journal of Indo-European Studies | year= 2007 | volume= 35 | issue= 1\u20132 | pages= 82\u2013109}}</ref> however, there is also a long tradition of wave-model approaches.<ref>{{cite book | title= Les dialectes indo-europ\u00e9ens | publisher= Honor\u00e9 Champion | author= Meillet, Antoine | year= 1908 | location= Paris}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title= I dialetti indoeuropei | publisher= Paideia | author= Bonfante, Giuliano | year= 1931 | location= Brescia}}</ref>{{sfn|Porzig|1954}}\n\nIn addition to genealogical changes, many of the early changes in Indo-European languages can be attributed to [[language contact]]. It has been asserted, for example, that many of the more striking features shared by Italic languages (Latin, Oscan, Umbrian, etc.) might well be [[Areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]]. More certainly, very similar-looking alterations in the systems of [[long vowel]]s in the West Germanic languages greatly postdate any possible notion of a [[proto-language]] innovation (and cannot readily be regarded as \"areal\", either, because English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area). In a similar vein, there are many similar innovations in Germanic and Balto-Slavic that are far more likely areal features than traceable to a common proto-language, such as the uniform development of a [[high vowel]] (*''u'' in the case of Germanic, *''i/u'' in the case of Baltic and Slavic) before the PIE syllabic resonants *''\u1e5b, *\u1e37, *\u1e43, *\u1e47'', unique to these two groups among IE languages, which is in agreement with the wave model. The [[Balkan sprachbund]] even features areal convergence among members of very different branches.\n\nAn extension to the ''[[Donald Ringe|Ringe]]-[[Tandy Warnow|Warnow]] model of language evolution'', suggests that early IE had featured limited contact between distinct lineages, with only the Germanic subfamily exhibiting a less treelike behaviour as it acquired some characteristics from neighbours early in its evolution. The internal diversification of especially West Germanic is cited to have been radically non-treelike.<ref>{{Cite journal |url= http://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/Papers/NRWlanguage.pdf |title= Perfect Phylogenetic Networks: A New Methodology for Reconstructing the Evolutionary History of Natural Languages |first= Luay |last= Nakhleh |first2= Don |last2= Ringe |lastauthoramp= yes |first3= Tandy |last3= Warnow|author3-link= Tandy Warnow |year= 2005 |journal= Language |volume= 81 |issue= 2 |pages= 382\u2013420 |doi= 10.1353/lan.2005.0078 |postscript= <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

According to another view, the Anatolian subgroup left the Indo-European parent language comparatively late, approximately at the same time as Indo-Iranian and later than the Greek or Armenian divisions. A third view, especially prevalent in the so-called French school of Indo-European studies, holds that extant similarities in non-[[satem]] languages in general\u2014including Anatolian\u2014might be due to their peripheral location in the Indo-European language-area and to early separation, rather than indicating a special ancestral relationship.<ref>''Britannica'' 15th edition, 22 p. 594, \"Indo-Hittite hypothesis\"</ref> Hans J.

In the satem languages, which include the Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian branches, as well as (in most respects) Albanian and Armenian, the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European phonology#Consonants|Proto-Indo-European palatovelars]] remained distinct and were fricativized, while the labiovelars merged with the 'plain velars.' In the centum languages, the palatovelars merged with the plain velars, while the labiovelars remained distinct. The results of these alternative developments are exemplified by the words for \"hundred\" in Avestan (''satem'') and Latin (''centum'')\u2014the initial palatovelar developed into a fricative [s] in the former, but became an ordinary velar [k] in the latter.\n\nRather than being a genealogical separation, the centum\u2013satem division is commonly seen as resulting from innovative changes that spread across PIE dialect-branches over a particular geographical area; the centum\u2013satem [[isogloss]] intersects a number of other isoglosses that mark distinctions between features in the early IE branches. It may be that the centum branches in fact reflect the original state of affairs in PIE, and only the satem branches shared a set of innovations, which affected all but the peripheral areas of the PIE dialect continuum.<ref>''Britannica'' 15th edition, vol.22, 1981, pp. 588, 594</ref> Kortlandt proposes that the ancestors of Balts and Slavs took part in satemization before being drawn later into the western Indo-European sphere.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf |first= Frederik |last= Kortlandt |title= The spread of the Indo-Europeans |year= 1989 |accessdate= 2010-08-07}}</ref>\n\n===Suggested macrofamilies===\n\nSome linguists propose that Indo-European languages form part of one of several hypothetical [[macrofamily|macrofamilies]]. However, these theories remain highly controversial, not being accepted by most linguists in the field. Some of the smaller proposed macrofamilies include:\n* [[Pontic languages|Pontic]], postulated by [[John Colarusso]], which joins Indo-European with [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]]\n* [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]], joining Indo-European with [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]\n\nOther, greater proposed families including Indo-European languages, include:\n* [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], a theory championed by [[Joseph Greenberg]], comprising the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] and various '[[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]]' families ([[Ainu language|Ainu]], [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]], [[Nivkh languages|Nivkh]], [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]], [[Eskimo-Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]]) and possibly others\n* [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]], comprising all or some of the Eurasiatic languages as well as the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (or wider, [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|Elamo-Dravidian]]) and [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language families\n\nObjections to such groupings are not based on any theoretical claim about the likely historical existence or non-existence of such macrofamilies; it is entirely reasonable to suppose that they might have existed. The serious difficulty lies in identifying the details of actual relationships between language families, because it is very hard to find concrete evidence that transcends chance resemblance, or is not equally likely explained as being due to [[loanword|borrowing]] (including [[Wanderwort|Wanderw\u00f6rter]], which can travel very long distances). Because the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] in historical linguistics declines over time, at great enough time-depths it becomes open to reasonable doubt that one can even distinguish between signal and noise.\n\n==Evolution==\n\n===Proto-Indo-European===\n{{Main|Proto-Indo-European language}}\n[[File:IE expansion.png|upright=0.9|thumb|Scheme of Indo-European migrations from ca. 4000 to 1000 BC according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]].]]\nThe proposed Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) is the [[Comparative method|reconstructed]] common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, spoken by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became certain enough to establish its relationship to PIE. Using the method of [[internal reconstruction]] an earlier stage, called Pre-Proto-Indo-European, has been proposed.\n\nPIE was an [[inflected language]], in which the grammatical relationships between words were signaled through inflectional morphemes (usually endings). The [[root (linguistics)|roots]] of PIE are basic [[morpheme]]s carrying a [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] meaning. By addition of [[suffix]]es, they form [[stem (linguistics)|stems]], and by addition of [[Ending (linguistics)|endings]], these form grammatically inflected words ([[Indo-European noun|nouns]] or [[Indo-European verb|verbs]]).

These generally include the ancient Indo-European languages that are both well-attested and documented at an early date, although some languages from later periods are important if they are particularly [[conservative (language)|linguistically conservative]] (most notably, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]). Early poetry is of special significance because of the rigid [[poetic meter]] normally employed, which makes it possible to reconstruct a number of features (e.g. [[vowel length]]) that were either unwritten or corrupted in the process of transmission down to the earliest extant written [[manuscript]]s.\n\nMost noticeable of all:<ref name=\"Beekes2011One\">{{cite book|author=Robert S.P.

This language is unique in that its source documents were all composed orally, and were passed down through [[oral tradition]] ([[shakha]] schools) for c. 2,000 years before ever being written down. The oldest documents are all in poetic form; oldest and most important of all is the [[Rigveda]] (c. 1500 BC).\n* [[Ancient Greek]] (c. 750\u2013400 BC). [[Mycenaean Greek]] (c. 1450 BC) is the oldest recorded form, but its value is lessened by the limited material, restricted subject matter, and highly ambiguous writing system. More important is Ancient Greek, documented extensively beginning with the two [[Homeric poems]] (the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', c. 750 BC).\n* [[Hittite language|Hittite]] (c. 1700\u20131200 BC). This is the earliest-recorded of all Indo-European languages, and highly divergent from the others due to the early separation of the [[Anatolian languages]] from the remainder. It possesses some highly archaic features found only fragmentarily, if at all, in other languages. At the same time, however, it appears to have undergone a large number of early phonological and grammatical changes which, combined with the ambiguities of its writing system, hinder its usefulness somewhat.\n\nOther primary sources:\n* [[Latin]], attested in a huge amount of poetic and prose material in the [[Classical Latin|Classical]] period (c. 200 BC \u2013 100 AD) and limited [[Old Latin|older material]] from as early as c. 600 BC.\n* [[Gothic language|Gothic]] (the most archaic well-documented [[Germanic language]], c. 350 AD), along with the combined witness of the other old Germanic languages: most importantly, [[Old English]] (c. 800\u20131000 AD), [[Old High German]] (c. 750\u20131000 AD) and [[Old Norse]] (c. 1100\u20131300 AD, with limited earlier sources dating all the way back to c. 200 AD).\n* [[Old Avestan]] (c. 1700\u20131200 BC) and [[Avestan language|Younger Avestan]] (c. 900 BC).

(The correctness of the terms ''palatal'' and ''plain velar'' is disputed; see [[Proto-Indo-European phonology]].) All daughter languages have reduced the number of distinctions among these sounds, often in divergent ways.\n\nAs an example, in [[English language|English]], one of the [[Germanic language]]s, the following are some of the major changes that happened:\n{{ordered list\n|1= As in other [[centum]] languages, the \"plain velar\" and \"palatal\" stops merged, reducing the number of stops from 15 to 12.\n|2= As in the other Germanic languages, the [[Germanic sound shift]] changed the realization of all stop consonants, with each consonant shifting to a different one:\n: {{PIE|b\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|b}} \u2192 {{PIE|p}} \u2192 {{PIE|f}}\n: {{PIE|d\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|d}} \u2192 {{PIE|t}} \u2192 {{PIE|\u03b8}}\n: {{PIE|g\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|g}} \u2192 {{PIE|k}} \u2192 {{PIE|x}} (Later initial {{PIE|x}} \u2192{{PIE|h}})\n: {{PIE|g\u02b7\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|g\u02b7}} \u2192 {{PIE|k\u02b7}} \u2192 {{PIE|x\u02b7}} (Later initial {{PIE|x\u02b7}} \u2192{{PIE|h\u02b7}})\nEach original consonant shifted one position to the right.  For example, original {{PIE|d\u02b0}} became {{PIE|d}}, while original {{PIE|d}} became {{PIE|t}} and original {{PIE|t}} became {{PIE|\u03b8}} (written ''th'' in English).  This is the original source of the English sounds written ''f'', ''th'', ''h'' and ''wh''.  Examples, comparing English with Latin, where the sounds largely remain unshifted:\n:For PIE ''p'': ''piscis'' vs. ''fish''; ''p\u0113s, p\u0113dis'' vs. ''foot''; ''pluvium'' \"rain\" vs. ''flow''; ''pater'' vs. ''father''\n:For PIE ''t'': ''tr\u0113s'' vs. ''three''; ''m\u0101ter'' vs. ''mother''\n:For PIE ''d'': ''decem'' vs. ''ten''; ''p\u0113dis'' vs. ''foot''; ''quid'' vs. ''what''\n:For PIE ''k'': ''centum'' vs. ''hund(red)''; ''capere'' \"to take\" vs. ''have''\n:For PIE ''k\u02b7'': ''quid'' vs. ''what''; ''quand\u014d'' vs. ''when''\n|3= Various further changes affected consonants in the middle or end of a word:\n* The voiced stops resulting from the sound shift were softened to voiced [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] (or perhaps the sound shift directly generated fricatives in these positions).\n* [[Verner's law]] also turned some of the voiceless fricatives resulting from the sound shift into voiced fricatives or stops.  This is why the ''t'' in Latin ''centum'' ends up as ''d'' in ''hund(red)'' rather than the expected ''th''.\n* Most remaining ''h'' sounds disappeared, while remaining ''f'' and ''th'' became voiced.  For example, Latin ''decem'' ends up as ''ten'' with no ''h'' in the middle (but note ''ta\u00edhun'' \"ten\" in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], an archaic Germanic language).  Similarly, the words ''seven'' and ''have'' have a voiced ''v'' (compare Latin ''septem'', ''capere''), while ''father'' and ''mother'' have a voiced ''th'', although not spelled differently (compare Latin ''pater'', ''m\u0101ter'').\n}}\n\nNone of the daughter-language families (except possibly [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], particularly [[Luvian language|Luvian]]) reflect the plain velar stops differently from the other two series, and there is even a certain amount of dispute whether this series existed at all in PIE.  The major distinction between [[Centum-satem isogloss|''centum'' and ''satem'']] languages corresponds to the outcome of the PIE plain velars:\n* The \"central\" ''satem'' languages ([[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) reflect both \"plain velar\" and labiovelar stops as plain velars, often with secondary [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] before a [[front vowel]] (''e i \u0113 \u012b'').  The \"palatal\" stops are palatalized and often appear as [[sibilant]]s (usually but not always distinct from the secondarily palatalized stops).\n* The \"peripheral\" ''centum'' languages ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian language|Tocharian]]) reflect both \"palatal\" and \"plain velar\" stops as plain velars, while the labiovelars continue unchanged, often with later reduction into plain [[labial consonant|labial]] or [[velar consonant]]s.\n\nThe three-way PIE distinction between voiceless, voiced and voiced aspirated stops is considered extremely unusual from the perspective of [[linguistic typology]]\u2014particularly in the existence of voiced aspirated stops without a corresponding series of voiceless aspirated stops. None of the various daughter-language families continue it unchanged, with numerous \"solutions\" to the apparently unstable PIE situation:\n* The [[Indo-Aryan language]]s preserve the three series unchanged but have evolved a fourth series of voiceless aspirated consonants.\n* The [[Iranian language]]s probably passed through the same stage, subsequently changing the aspirated stops into fricatives.\n* [[Greek language|Greek]] converted the voiced aspirates into voiceless aspirates.\n* [[Italic languages|Italic]] probably passed through the same stage, but reflects the voiced aspirates as voiceless fricatives, especially ''f'' (or sometimes plain voiced stops in [[Latin]]).\n* [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] merge the voiced aspirated into plain voiced stops.\n* [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] change all three series in a [[chain shift]] (e.g. with ''bh b p'' becoming ''b p f'' (known as ''[[Grimm's law]]'' in Germanic).\n\nAmong the other notable changes affecting consonants are:\n* The [[Ruki sound law]] (''s'' becomes {{IPA|/\u0283/}} before ''r, u, k, i'') in the ''[[satem]]'' languages.\n* Loss of prevocalic ''p'' in [[Proto-Celtic]].\n* Development of prevocalic ''s'' to ''h'' in [[Proto-Greek]], with later loss of ''h'' between vowels.\n* [[Verner's law]] in [[Proto-Germanic]].\n* [[Grassmann's law]] (dissimilation of aspirates) independently in Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian.\n\nThe following table shows the basic outcomes of PIE consonants in some of the most important daughter languages for the purposes of reconstruction.

Some IE languages have moved from [[synthetic language|synthetic]] verb systems to largely [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] systems. In addition, the [[pronoun]]s of periphrastic forms are in brackets when they appear. Some of these verbs have undergone a change in meaning as well.\n* In Modern Irish ''beir'' usually only carries the meaning ''to bear'' in the sense of bearing a child; its common meanings are ''to catch, grab''.\n* The Hindi verb ''bharn\u0101'', the continuation of the Sanskrit verb, can have a variety of meanings, but the most common is \"to fill\". The forms given in the table, although etymologically derived from the present indicative, now have the meaning of [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]].  The present indicative is conjugated periphrastically, using a participle (etymologically the Sanskrit present participle ''bharant-'') and an auxiliary: ''mai\u1e43 bhart\u0101 h\u016b\u1e43, t\u016b bhart\u0101 hai, vah bhart\u0101 hai, ham bharte hai\u1e43, tum bharte ho, ve bharte hai\u1e43'' (masculine forms).\n* German is not directly descended from Gothic, but the Gothic forms are a close approximation of what the early West Germanic forms of c. 400 AD would have looked like.  The cognate of Germanic ''beranan'' (English ''bear'') survives in German only in the compound ''geb\u00e4ren'', meaning \"bear (a child)\".\n* The Latin verb ''ferre'' is irregular, and not a good representative of a normal thematic verb. In most Romance Languages such as French, other verbs now mean \"to carry\" (e.g. Fr. ''porter'' < Lat. ''portare'') and ''ferre'' was only borrowed and nativized in compounds such as ''souffrir'' \"to suffer\" (from Latin ''sub-'' and ''ferre'') and {{lang|fr|conf\u00e9rer}} \"to confer\" (from Latin \"con-\" and \"ferre\").\n* In Modern [[Greek language|Greek]], ''phero'' \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 (modern transliteration ''fero'') \"to bear\" is still used but only in specific contexts and is most common in such compounds as \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b5\u03ba\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 etc. The form that is (very) common today is ''pherno'' \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03c9 (modern transliteration ''ferno'') meaning \"to bring\". Additionally, the perfective form of ''pherno'' (used for the subjunctive voice and also for the future tense) is also ''phero''.\n* In Modern [[Russian language|Russian]] ''\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c'' (brat') carries the meaning ''to take''. ''\u0411\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f'' (br'em'a) means ''burden'', as something heavy to bear, and derivative ''\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c'' (b'er'em'ennost') means ''pregnancy''.\n\n== Comparison of cognates ==\n{{Main|Indo-European vocabulary}}\n{{See also|Proto-Indo-European numerals|List of numbers in various languages}}\n\n==Present distribution==\n[[File:Indo-European-speaking world.png|thumb|left|upright=1.55|{{legend|#013857|Official or Primary Language}}{{legend|#0371b0|Secondary Official Language}}{{legend|#80a4c0|Recognized}}{{legend|#ccd2e8|Significant}}{{legend|#e5e5e5|No use}}]]\n\n[[File:Languages of North America.svg|thumb|upright=0.95|The approximate present-day distribution of Indo-European languages within the Americas by country:<br />\n[[Romance languages|Romance]]:\n{{legend|#3EBA00|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]}}\n{{legend|#EA6500|[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]\u2013[[Galician language|Galician]]}}\n{{legend|#001E96|[[French language|French]]}}\n[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]:\n{{legend|#C60000|[[English language|English]]}}\n{{legend|#FFD000|[[Dutch language|Dutch]]}} ]]\nToday, Indo-European languages are spoken by 3.2 billion [[Native speaker#Defining \"native speaker\"|native speakers]] across all inhabited continents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=family |title=Ethnologue list of language families |publisher=Ethnologue.com |edition=22th |date= |accessdate=2019-07-02}}</ref> the largest number by far for any recognised language family.

The ancient [[Indo-European migrations]] and widespread dissemination of [[Indo-European culture]] throughout [[Eurasia]], including that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] themselves, and that of their daughter cultures including the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryans]], [[Iranian peoples]], [[Celts]], [[Hellenistic period|Greeks]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Germanic peoples]], and [[Slavs]], led to these peoples' branches of the language family already taking a dominant foothold in virtually all of [[Eurasia]] except for swathes of the [[Near East]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]], replacing many (but not all) of the previously-spoken [[pre-Indo-European languages]] of this extensive area. However [[Semitic languages]] remain dominant in much of the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], and [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]] in much of the [[Caucasus]] region. Similarly in [[Europe]] and the [[Urals]] the [[Uralic languages]] (such as Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian etc) remain, as does [[Basque language|Basque]], a pre-Indo-European Isolate.\n\nDespite being unaware of their common linguistic origin, diverse groups of Indo-European speakers continued to culturally dominate and often replace the indigenous languages of the western two-thirds of Eurasia. By the beginning of the [[Common Era]], Indo-European peoples controlled almost the entirety of this area: the Celts western and central Europe, the Romans southern Europe, the Germanic peoples northern Europe, the Slavs eastern Europe, the Iranian peoples most of western and central Asia and parts of eastern Europe, and the Indo-Aryan peoples in the [[Indian subcontinent]], with the [[Tocharians]] inhabiting the Indo-European frontier in western China. By the medieval period, only the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian]], and [[Uralic languages]], and the [[language isolate]] [[Basque language|Basque]] remained of the (relatively) [[Paleo-European languages|indigenous languages of Europe]] and the western half of Asia.\n\nDespite medieval invasions by [[Eurasian nomads]], a group to which the Proto-Indo-Europeans had once belonged, Indo-European expansion reached another peak in the [[early modern period]] with the dramatic increase in the population of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and European expansionism throughout the globe during the [[Age of Discovery]], as well as the continued replacement and assimilation of surrounding non-Indo-European languages and peoples due to increased state centralization and [[nationalism]]. These trends compounded throughout the modern period due to the general global [[population growth]] and the results of [[European colonization]] of the [[Western Hemisphere]] and [[Oceania]], leading to an explosion in the number of Indo-European speakers as well as the territories inhabited by them.\n\nDue to colonization and the modern dominance of Indo-European languages in the fields of politics, global science, technology, education, finance, and sports, even many modern countries whose populations largely speak non-Indo-European languages have Indo-European languages as official languages, and the majority of the global population speaks at least one Indo-European language.

It comprises most of the languages of Europe together with those of the northern [[Indian Subcontinent]] and the [[Iranian Plateau]]. A few of these languages, such as English, have expanded through [[colonialism]] in the modern period and are now spoken across all continents. The Indo-European family is divided into several branches or sub-families, the largest of which are the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], and [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] groups. The most populous individual languages within them are [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], each with over 100 million speakers. [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Persian language|Persian]] have more than 50 million each. In total, 46% of the world's population (3.2 billion) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language, by far the highest of any language family. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by ''[[Ethnologue]]'', with over two thirds (313) of them belonging to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian branch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=2-16|title=Ethnologue report for Indo-European|publisher=Ethnologue.com}}</ref> \n\nAll Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language, [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], spoken sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era. Its precise geographical location, the Indo-European [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|''urheimat'']], is unknown and has been the object of many competing hypotheses. By the time the first written records appeared, Indo-European had already spread out into a large number of languages spoken across much of Europe and south-west Asia. Written evidence of Indo-European appeared during the [[Bronze Age]] in the form of [[Mycenaean Greek]] and the [[Anatolian languages]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]]. The oldest records are isolated Hittite words and names \u2013 interspersed in texts that are otherwise in the unrelated [[Akkadian language|Old Assyrian]] language, a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] language \u2013 found in the texts of the Assyrian colony of [[K\u00fcltepe]] in eastern Anatolia in the 20th century BC.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bryce |first=Trevor |date= 2005|title=Kingdom of the Hittites: New Edition |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=37 |isbn=978-0-19-928132-9 |access-date= }}</ref> Although no older written records of the original [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] remain, some aspects of their culture and [[Proto-Indo-European religion|religion]] can be reconstructed from later evidence in the daughter cultures.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|last=Mallory|first=J.

The analysis of the family relationships between the Indo-European languages and the reconstruction of their common source was central to the development of the methodology of historical linguistics as an academic discipline in the 19th century.\n\nThe Indo-European family is not known to be linked to any other language family through any more distant genetic relationship, although several [[#Suggested macrofamilies|disputed proposals]] to that effect have been made. \n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the linguistic concept of Indo-European languages was frequently used interchangeably with the racial concepts of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] and [[Japhetite]].<ref name=\"Kidd2006\">{{cite book|author=Colin Kidd|title=The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600\u20132000|url={{Google books|aNT3q1HjY_MC|page=PA23|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45753-8|pages=23\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==History of Indo-European linguistics==\n{{See also|Indo-European studies#History}}\nIn the 16th century, European visitors to the [[Indian subcontinent]] began to notice similarities among [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], and [[languages of Europe|European]] languages.

Coeurdoux made a thorough comparison of Sanskrit, Latin and Greek [[grammatical conjugation|conjugations]] in the late 1760s to suggest a relationship among them.

Membership in the various branches, groups and subgroups of Indo-European is also genealogical, but here the defining factors are ''shared innovations'' among various languages, suggesting a common ancestor that split off from other Indo-European groups. For example, what makes the Germanic languages a branch of Indo-European is that much of their structure and phonology can be stated in rules that apply to all of them. Many of their common features are presumed innovations that took place in [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], the source of all the Germanic languages.\n\n===Tree versus wave model===\n{{See also|Language change}}\nThe \"[[tree model]]\" is considered an appropriate representation of the genealogical history of a language family if communities do not remain in contact after their languages have started to diverge. In this case, subgroups defined by shared innovations form a nested pattern. The tree model is not appropriate in cases where languages remain in contact as they diversify; in such cases subgroups may overlap, and the \"[[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]]\" is a more accurate representation.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Fran\u00e7ois\n  | first = Alexandre\n  | contribution = Trees, Waves and Linkages: Models of Language Diversification\n  | editor1-last = Bowern\n  | editor1-first = Claire\n  | editor2-last = Evans\n  | editor2-first = Bethwyn\n  | title = The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics\n  | series=\n  | pages = 161\u201389\n  | publisher = Routledge\n  | place = London\n  | year = 2014\n  | isbn = 978-0-415-52789-7\n  | contribution-url = http://alex.francois.free.fr/data/AlexFrancois_2014_HHL_Trees-waves-linkages_Diversification.pdf\n  | ref = francois\n }}</ref> Most approaches to Indo-European subgrouping to date have assumed that the tree model is by-and-large valid for Indo-European;<ref>{{cite journal | title= From August Schleicher to Sergei Starostin: on the development of the tree-diagram models of the Indo-European languages | author= Bla\u017eek, V\u00e1clav | journal= Journal of Indo-European Studies | year= 2007 | volume= 35 | issue= 1\u20132 | pages= 82\u2013109}}</ref> however, there is also a long tradition of wave-model approaches.<ref>{{cite book | title= Les dialectes indo-europ\u00e9ens | publisher= Honor\u00e9 Champion | author= Meillet, Antoine | year= 1908 | location= Paris}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title= I dialetti indoeuropei | publisher= Paideia | author= Bonfante, Giuliano | year= 1931 | location= Brescia}}</ref>{{sfn|Porzig|1954}}\n\nIn addition to genealogical changes, many of the early changes in Indo-European languages can be attributed to [[language contact]]. It has been asserted, for example, that many of the more striking features shared by Italic languages (Latin, Oscan, Umbrian, etc.) might well be [[Areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]]. More certainly, very similar-looking alterations in the systems of [[long vowel]]s in the West Germanic languages greatly postdate any possible notion of a [[proto-language]] innovation (and cannot readily be regarded as \"areal\", either, because English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area). In a similar vein, there are many similar innovations in Germanic and Balto-Slavic that are far more likely areal features than traceable to a common proto-language, such as the uniform development of a [[high vowel]] (*''u'' in the case of Germanic, *''i/u'' in the case of Baltic and Slavic) before the PIE syllabic resonants *''\u1e5b, *\u1e37, *\u1e43, *\u1e47'', unique to these two groups among IE languages, which is in agreement with the wave model. The [[Balkan sprachbund]] even features areal convergence among members of very different branches.\n\nAn extension to the ''[[Donald Ringe|Ringe]]-[[Tandy Warnow|Warnow]] model of language evolution'', suggests that early IE had featured limited contact between distinct lineages, with only the Germanic subfamily exhibiting a less treelike behaviour as it acquired some characteristics from neighbours early in its evolution. The internal diversification of especially West Germanic is cited to have been radically non-treelike.<ref>{{Cite journal |url= http://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/Papers/NRWlanguage.pdf |title= Perfect Phylogenetic Networks: A New Methodology for Reconstructing the Evolutionary History of Natural Languages |first= Luay |last= Nakhleh |first2= Don |last2= Ringe |lastauthoramp= yes |first3= Tandy |last3= Warnow|author3-link= Tandy Warnow |year= 2005 |journal= Language |volume= 81 |issue= 2 |pages= 382\u2013420 |doi= 10.1353/lan.2005.0078 |postscript= <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

A third view, especially prevalent in the so-called French school of Indo-European studies, holds that extant similarities in non-[[satem]] languages in general\u2014including Anatolian\u2014might be due to their peripheral location in the Indo-European language-area and to early separation, rather than indicating a special ancestral relationship.<ref>''Britannica'' 15th edition, 22 p. 594, \"Indo-Hittite hypothesis\"</ref> Hans J.

In the satem languages, which include the Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian branches, as well as (in most respects) Albanian and Armenian, the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European phonology#Consonants|Proto-Indo-European palatovelars]] remained distinct and were fricativized, while the labiovelars merged with the 'plain velars.' In the centum languages, the palatovelars merged with the plain velars, while the labiovelars remained distinct. The results of these alternative developments are exemplified by the words for \"hundred\" in Avestan (''satem'') and Latin (''centum'')\u2014the initial palatovelar developed into a fricative [s] in the former, but became an ordinary velar [k] in the latter.\n\nRather than being a genealogical separation, the centum\u2013satem division is commonly seen as resulting from innovative changes that spread across PIE dialect-branches over a particular geographical area; the centum\u2013satem [[isogloss]] intersects a number of other isoglosses that mark distinctions between features in the early IE branches. It may be that the centum branches in fact reflect the original state of affairs in PIE, and only the satem branches shared a set of innovations, which affected all but the peripheral areas of the PIE dialect continuum.<ref>''Britannica'' 15th edition, vol.22, 1981, pp. 588, 594</ref> Kortlandt proposes that the ancestors of Balts and Slavs took part in satemization before being drawn later into the western Indo-European sphere.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf |first= Frederik |last= Kortlandt |title= The spread of the Indo-Europeans |year= 1989 |accessdate= 2010-08-07}}</ref>\n\n===Suggested macrofamilies===\n\nSome linguists propose that Indo-European languages form part of one of several hypothetical [[macrofamily|macrofamilies]]. However, these theories remain highly controversial, not being accepted by most linguists in the field. Some of the smaller proposed macrofamilies include:\n* [[Pontic languages|Pontic]], postulated by [[John Colarusso]], which joins Indo-European with [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]]\n* [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]], joining Indo-European with [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]\n\nOther, greater proposed families including Indo-European languages, include:\n* [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], a theory championed by [[Joseph Greenberg]], comprising the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] and various '[[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]]' families ([[Ainu language|Ainu]], [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]], [[Nivkh languages|Nivkh]], [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]], [[Eskimo-Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]]) and possibly others\n* [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]], comprising all or some of the Eurasiatic languages as well as the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (or wider, [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|Elamo-Dravidian]]) and [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language families\n\nObjections to such groupings are not based on any theoretical claim about the likely historical existence or non-existence of such macrofamilies; it is entirely reasonable to suppose that they might have existed. The serious difficulty lies in identifying the details of actual relationships between language families, because it is very hard to find concrete evidence that transcends chance resemblance, or is not equally likely explained as being due to [[loanword|borrowing]] (including [[Wanderwort|Wanderw\u00f6rter]], which can travel very long distances). Because the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] in historical linguistics declines over time, at great enough time-depths it becomes open to reasonable doubt that one can even distinguish between signal and noise.\n\n==Evolution==\n\n===Proto-Indo-European===\n{{Main|Proto-Indo-European language}}\n[[File:IE expansion.png|upright=0.9|thumb|Scheme of Indo-European migrations from ca. 4000 to 1000 BC according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]].]]\nThe proposed Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) is the [[Comparative method|reconstructed]] common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, spoken by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became certain enough to establish its relationship to PIE. Using the method of [[internal reconstruction]] an earlier stage, called Pre-Proto-Indo-European, has been proposed.\n\nPIE was an [[inflected language]], in which the grammatical relationships between words were signaled through inflectional morphemes (usually endings). The [[root (linguistics)|roots]] of PIE are basic [[morpheme]]s carrying a [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] meaning. By addition of [[suffix]]es, they form [[stem (linguistics)|stems]], and by addition of [[Ending (linguistics)|endings]], these form grammatically inflected words ([[Indo-European noun|nouns]] or [[Indo-European verb|verbs]]). The reconstructed [[Indo-European verb]] system is complex and, like the noun, exhibits a system of [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]].\n\n===Diversification===\n{{See also|Indo-European migrations}}\n{{Gallery\n|title=Possible expansion of Indo-European languages according to the Kurgan hypothesis\n|width=180 | height=100\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:IE5500BP.png\n |alt1=IE languages 3500 BC\n |IE languages c. 3500 BC\n|File:IE4500BP.png\n |alt2=IE languages 2500 BC\n |IE languages c. 2500 BC\n|File:IE3500BP.png\n |alt3=IE languages 1500 BC\n |IE languages c. 1500 BC\n|File:IE1500BP.png\n |alt4=IE languages 500 AD\n |IE languages c. 500 AD\n}}\nThe diversification of the parent language into the attested branches of daughter languages is historically unattested.

These generally include the ancient Indo-European languages that are both well-attested and documented at an early date, although some languages from later periods are important if they are particularly [[conservative (language)|linguistically conservative]] (most notably, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]). Early poetry is of special significance because of the rigid [[poetic meter]] normally employed, which makes it possible to reconstruct a number of features (e.g. [[vowel length]]) that were either unwritten or corrupted in the process of transmission down to the earliest extant written [[manuscript]]s.\n\nMost noticeable of all:<ref name=\"Beekes2011One\">{{cite book|author=Robert S.P.

This language is unique in that its source documents were all composed orally, and were passed down through [[oral tradition]] ([[shakha]] schools) for c. 2,000 years before ever being written down. The oldest documents are all in poetic form; oldest and most important of all is the [[Rigveda]] (c. 1500 BC).\n* [[Ancient Greek]] (c. 750\u2013400 BC). [[Mycenaean Greek]] (c. 1450 BC) is the oldest recorded form, but its value is lessened by the limited material, restricted subject matter, and highly ambiguous writing system. More important is Ancient Greek, documented extensively beginning with the two [[Homeric poems]] (the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', c. 750 BC).\n* [[Hittite language|Hittite]] (c. 1700\u20131200 BC). This is the earliest-recorded of all Indo-European languages, and highly divergent from the others due to the early separation of the [[Anatolian languages]] from the remainder. It possesses some highly archaic features found only fragmentarily, if at all, in other languages. At the same time, however, it appears to have undergone a large number of early phonological and grammatical changes which, combined with the ambiguities of its writing system, hinder its usefulness somewhat.\n\nOther primary sources:\n* [[Latin]], attested in a huge amount of poetic and prose material in the [[Classical Latin|Classical]] period (c. 200 BC \u2013 100 AD) and limited [[Old Latin|older material]] from as early as c. 600 BC.\n* [[Gothic language|Gothic]] (the most archaic well-documented [[Germanic language]], c. 350 AD), along with the combined witness of the other old Germanic languages: most importantly, [[Old English]] (c. 800\u20131000 AD), [[Old High German]] (c. 750\u20131000 AD) and [[Old Norse]] (c. 1100\u20131300 AD, with limited earlier sources dating all the way back to c. 200 AD).\n* [[Old Avestan]] (c. 1700\u20131200 BC) and [[Avestan language|Younger Avestan]] (c. 900 BC). Documentation is sparse, but nonetheless quite important due to its highly archaic nature.\n* Modern [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], with limited records in [[Old Lithuanian]] (c. 1500\u20131700 AD).\n* [[Old Church Slavonic]] (c. 900\u20131000 AD).\n\nOther secondary sources, of lesser value due to poor attestation:\n* [[Luwian language|Luwian]], [[Lycian language|Lycian]], [[Lydian language|Lydian]] and other [[Anatolian languages]] (c. 1400\u2013400 BC).\n* [[Oscan]], [[Umbrian]] and other [[Italic languages|Old Italic]] languages (c. 600\u2013200 BC).\n* [[Old Persian]] (c. 500 BC).\n* [[Old Prussian]] (c. 1350\u20131600 AD); even more archaic than Lithuanian.\n\nOther secondary sources, of lesser value due to extensive phonological changes and relatively limited attestation:<ref name=\"Beekes2011\">{{cite book|author=Robert S.P.

(The correctness of the terms ''palatal'' and ''plain velar'' is disputed; see [[Proto-Indo-European phonology]].) All daughter languages have reduced the number of distinctions among these sounds, often in divergent ways.\n\nAs an example, in [[English language|English]], one of the [[Germanic language]]s, the following are some of the major changes that happened:\n{{ordered list\n|1= As in other [[centum]] languages, the \"plain velar\" and \"palatal\" stops merged, reducing the number of stops from 15 to 12.\n|2= As in the other Germanic languages, the [[Germanic sound shift]] changed the realization of all stop consonants, with each consonant shifting to a different one:\n: {{PIE|b\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|b}} \u2192 {{PIE|p}} \u2192 {{PIE|f}}\n: {{PIE|d\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|d}} \u2192 {{PIE|t}} \u2192 {{PIE|\u03b8}}\n: {{PIE|g\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|g}} \u2192 {{PIE|k}} \u2192 {{PIE|x}} (Later initial {{PIE|x}} \u2192{{PIE|h}})\n: {{PIE|g\u02b7\u02b0}} \u2192 {{PIE|g\u02b7}} \u2192 {{PIE|k\u02b7}} \u2192 {{PIE|x\u02b7}} (Later initial {{PIE|x\u02b7}} \u2192{{PIE|h\u02b7}})\nEach original consonant shifted one position to the right.  For example, original {{PIE|d\u02b0}} became {{PIE|d}}, while original {{PIE|d}} became {{PIE|t}} and original {{PIE|t}} became {{PIE|\u03b8}} (written ''th'' in English).  This is the original source of the English sounds written ''f'', ''th'', ''h'' and ''wh''.  Examples, comparing English with Latin, where the sounds largely remain unshifted:\n:For PIE ''p'': ''piscis'' vs. ''fish''; ''p\u0113s, p\u0113dis'' vs. ''foot''; ''pluvium'' \"rain\" vs. ''flow''; ''pater'' vs. ''father''\n:For PIE ''t'': ''tr\u0113s'' vs. ''three''; ''m\u0101ter'' vs. ''mother''\n:For PIE ''d'': ''decem'' vs. ''ten''; ''p\u0113dis'' vs. ''foot''; ''quid'' vs. ''what''\n:For PIE ''k'': ''centum'' vs. ''hund(red)''; ''capere'' \"to take\" vs. ''have''\n:For PIE ''k\u02b7'': ''quid'' vs. ''what''; ''quand\u014d'' vs. ''when''\n|3= Various further changes affected consonants in the middle or end of a word:\n* The voiced stops resulting from the sound shift were softened to voiced [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] (or perhaps the sound shift directly generated fricatives in these positions).\n* [[Verner's law]] also turned some of the voiceless fricatives resulting from the sound shift into voiced fricatives or stops.  This is why the ''t'' in Latin ''centum'' ends up as ''d'' in ''hund(red)'' rather than the expected ''th''.\n* Most remaining ''h'' sounds disappeared, while remaining ''f'' and ''th'' became voiced.  For example, Latin ''decem'' ends up as ''ten'' with no ''h'' in the middle (but note ''ta\u00edhun'' \"ten\" in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], an archaic Germanic language).  Similarly, the words ''seven'' and ''have'' have a voiced ''v'' (compare Latin ''septem'', ''capere''), while ''father'' and ''mother'' have a voiced ''th'', although not spelled differently (compare Latin ''pater'', ''m\u0101ter'').\n}}\n\nNone of the daughter-language families (except possibly [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], particularly [[Luvian language|Luvian]]) reflect the plain velar stops differently from the other two series, and there is even a certain amount of dispute whether this series existed at all in PIE.  The major distinction between [[Centum-satem isogloss|''centum'' and ''satem'']] languages corresponds to the outcome of the PIE plain velars:\n* The \"central\" ''satem'' languages ([[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) reflect both \"plain velar\" and labiovelar stops as plain velars, often with secondary [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] before a [[front vowel]] (''e i \u0113 \u012b'').  The \"palatal\" stops are palatalized and often appear as [[sibilant]]s (usually but not always distinct from the secondarily palatalized stops).\n* The \"peripheral\" ''centum'' languages ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian language|Tocharian]]) reflect both \"palatal\" and \"plain velar\" stops as plain velars, while the labiovelars continue unchanged, often with later reduction into plain [[labial consonant|labial]] or [[velar consonant]]s.\n\nThe three-way PIE distinction between voiceless, voiced and voiced aspirated stops is considered extremely unusual from the perspective of [[linguistic typology]]\u2014particularly in the existence of voiced aspirated stops without a corresponding series of voiceless aspirated stops. None of the various daughter-language families continue it unchanged, with numerous \"solutions\" to the apparently unstable PIE situation:\n* The [[Indo-Aryan language]]s preserve the three series unchanged but have evolved a fourth series of voiceless aspirated consonants.\n* The [[Iranian language]]s probably passed through the same stage, subsequently changing the aspirated stops into fricatives.\n* [[Greek language|Greek]] converted the voiced aspirates into voiceless aspirates.\n* [[Italic languages|Italic]] probably passed through the same stage, but reflects the voiced aspirates as voiceless fricatives, especially ''f'' (or sometimes plain voiced stops in [[Latin]]).\n* [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] merge the voiced aspirated into plain voiced stops.\n* [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] change all three series in a [[chain shift]] (e.g. with ''bh b p'' becoming ''b p f'' (known as ''[[Grimm's law]]'' in Germanic).\n\nAmong the other notable changes affecting consonants are:\n* The [[Ruki sound law]] (''s'' becomes {{IPA|/\u0283/}} before ''r, u, k, i'') in the ''[[satem]]'' languages.\n* Loss of prevocalic ''p'' in [[Proto-Celtic]].\n* Development of prevocalic ''s'' to ''h'' in [[Proto-Greek]], with later loss of ''h'' between vowels.\n* [[Verner's law]] in [[Proto-Germanic]].\n* [[Grassmann's law]] (dissimilation of aspirates) independently in Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian.\n\nThe following table shows the basic outcomes of PIE consonants in some of the most important daughter languages for the purposes of reconstruction.

Some IE languages have moved from [[synthetic language|synthetic]] verb systems to largely [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] systems. In addition, the [[pronoun]]s of periphrastic forms are in brackets when they appear. Some of these verbs have undergone a change in meaning as well.\n* In Modern Irish ''beir'' usually only carries the meaning ''to bear'' in the sense of bearing a child; its common meanings are ''to catch, grab''.\n* The Hindi verb ''bharn\u0101'', the continuation of the Sanskrit verb, can have a variety of meanings, but the most common is \"to fill\". The forms given in the table, although etymologically derived from the present indicative, now have the meaning of [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]].  The present indicative is conjugated periphrastically, using a participle (etymologically the Sanskrit present participle ''bharant-'') and an auxiliary: ''mai\u1e43 bhart\u0101 h\u016b\u1e43, t\u016b bhart\u0101 hai, vah bhart\u0101 hai, ham bharte hai\u1e43, tum bharte ho, ve bharte hai\u1e43'' (masculine forms).\n* German is not directly descended from Gothic, but the Gothic forms are a close approximation of what the early West Germanic forms of c. 400 AD would have looked like.  The cognate of Germanic ''beranan'' (English ''bear'') survives in German only in the compound ''geb\u00e4ren'', meaning \"bear (a child)\".\n* The Latin verb ''ferre'' is irregular, and not a good representative of a normal thematic verb. In most Romance Languages such as French, other verbs now mean \"to carry\" (e.g. Fr. ''porter'' < Lat. ''portare'') and ''ferre'' was only borrowed and nativized in compounds such as ''souffrir'' \"to suffer\" (from Latin ''sub-'' and ''ferre'') and {{lang|fr|conf\u00e9rer}} \"to confer\" (from Latin \"con-\" and \"ferre\").\n* In Modern [[Greek language|Greek]], ''phero'' \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 (modern transliteration ''fero'') \"to bear\" is still used but only in specific contexts and is most common in such compounds as \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03b5\u03ba\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 etc. The form that is (very) common today is ''pherno'' \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03c9 (modern transliteration ''ferno'') meaning \"to bring\". Additionally, the perfective form of ''pherno'' (used for the subjunctive voice and also for the future tense) is also ''phero''.\n* In Modern [[Russian language|Russian]] ''\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c'' (brat') carries the meaning ''to take''. ''\u0411\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f'' (br'em'a) means ''burden'', as something heavy to bear, and derivative ''\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c'' (b'er'em'ennost') means ''pregnancy''.\n\n== Comparison of cognates ==\n{{Main|Indo-European vocabulary}}\n{{See also|Proto-Indo-European numerals|List of numbers in various languages}}\n\n==Present distribution==\n[[File:Indo-European-speaking world.png|thumb|left|upright=1.55|{{legend|#013857|Official or Primary Language}}{{legend|#0371b0|Secondary Official Language}}{{legend|#80a4c0|Recognized}}{{legend|#ccd2e8|Significant}}{{legend|#e5e5e5|No use}}]]\n\n[[File:Languages of North America.svg|thumb|upright=0.95|The approximate present-day distribution of Indo-European languages within the Americas by country:<br />\n[[Romance languages|Romance]]:\n{{legend|#3EBA00|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]}}\n{{legend|#EA6500|[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]\u2013[[Galician language|Galician]]}}\n{{legend|#001E96|[[French language|French]]}}\n[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]:\n{{legend|#C60000|[[English language|English]]}}\n{{legend|#FFD000|[[Dutch language|Dutch]]}} ]]\nToday, Indo-European languages are spoken by 3.2 billion [[Native speaker#Defining \"native speaker\"|native speakers]] across all inhabited continents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=family |title=Ethnologue list of language families |publisher=Ethnologue.com |edition=22th |date= |accessdate=2019-07-02}}</ref> the largest number by far for any recognised language family.

The ancient [[Indo-European migrations]] and widespread dissemination of [[Indo-European culture]] throughout [[Eurasia]], including that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] themselves, and that of their daughter cultures including the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryans]], [[Iranian peoples]], [[Celts]], [[Hellenistic period|Greeks]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Germanic peoples]], and [[Slavs]], led to these peoples' branches of the language family already taking a dominant foothold in virtually all of [[Eurasia]] except for swathes of the [[Near East]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]], replacing many (but not all) of the previously-spoken [[pre-Indo-European languages]] of this extensive area. However [[Semitic languages]] remain dominant in much of the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], and [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]] in much of the [[Caucasus]] region. Similarly in [[Europe]] and the [[Urals]] the [[Uralic languages]] (such as Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian etc) remain, as does [[Basque language|Basque]], a pre-Indo-European Isolate.\n\nDespite being unaware of their common linguistic origin, diverse groups of Indo-European speakers continued to culturally dominate and often replace the indigenous languages of the western two-thirds of Eurasia. By the beginning of the [[Common Era]], Indo-European peoples controlled almost the entirety of this area: the Celts western and central Europe, the Romans southern Europe, the Germanic peoples northern Europe, the Slavs eastern Europe, the Iranian peoples most of western and central Asia and parts of eastern Europe, and the Indo-Aryan peoples in the [[Indian subcontinent]], with the [[Tocharians]] inhabiting the Indo-European frontier in western China. By the medieval period, only the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian]], and [[Uralic languages]], and the [[language isolate]] [[Basque language|Basque]] remained of the (relatively) [[Paleo-European languages|indigenous languages of Europe]] and the western half of Asia.\n\nDespite medieval invasions by [[Eurasian nomads]], a group to which the Proto-Indo-Europeans had once belonged, Indo-European expansion reached another peak in the [[early modern period]] with the dramatic increase in the population of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and European expansionism throughout the globe during the [[Age of Discovery]], as well as the continued replacement and assimilation of surrounding non-Indo-European languages and peoples due to increased state centralization and [[nationalism]]. These trends compounded throughout the modern period due to the general global [[population growth]] and the results of [[European colonization]] of the [[Western Hemisphere]] and [[Oceania]], leading to an explosion in the number of Indo-European speakers as well as the territories inhabited by them.\n\nDue to colonization and the modern dominance of Indo-European languages in the fields of politics, global science, technology, education, finance, and sports, even many modern countries whose populations largely speak non-Indo-European languages have Indo-European languages as official languages, and the majority of the global population speaks at least one Indo-European language. The overwhelming majority of [[languages used on the Internet]] are Indo-European, with [[English language|English]] continuing to lead the group; English in general has in many respects [[English as a lingua franca|become the ''lingua franca'']] of global communication.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Grammatical conjugation]]\n* ''[[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language]]'' (book)\n* [[Indo-European copula]]\n* [[Indo-European sound laws]]\n* [[Indo-European studies]]\n* [[Indo-Semitic languages]]\n* [[Indo-Uralic languages]]\n* [[Eurasiatic languages]]\n* [[Language family]]\n* [[Languages of Asia]]\n* [[Languages of Europe]]\n* [[Languages of India]]\n* [[List of Indo-European languages]]\n* [[Proto-Indo-European root]]\n* [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last = Anthony | first = David W. | title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2007 | isbn =978-0-691-05887-0 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Auroux |first=Sylvain |title=History of the Language Sciences |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location=Berlin |year=2000 |isbn=978-3-11-016735-1 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Fortson | first=Benjamin W. | title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction |location=Malden, Massachusetts | publisher=Blackwell | year=2004 | isbn=978-1-4051-0315-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Grundriss der Vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen |first=Karl |last=Brugmann |author-link=Karl Brugmann |language=de |volume=Erster Band |location=Strassburg |publisher=Karl J.

During an interview, she reflected on her view of the proper perspective of budget cuts:\n\n<blockquote>Often those who cloak themselves in a cape of religiosity happen to be some who are the biggest cutters.

[[Betsy DeVos]], the chairman of the [[Michigan Republican Party]] (1996\u20132000, 2003-05), was upset that Granholm had decided \"to cloak her views on balancing the budget in religious terms in order to demonize her political opponents\".

In [[De Inventione]], Cicero had outlined a technical idea of rhetoric based on the handbooks of his era. But as he aged, his view changed to an \u201call-encompassing\u201d ideal modeled on [[Philo of Larissa|Philo]]\u2019s rhetorical teachings. Previous to and during Cicero\u2019s lifetime, there was a quarrel between rhetoricians and philosophers over whether rhetoric was restricted to only the forensic and technical sphere, or if it included the abstract and philosophical realm. \u201cSpecifically, Cicero suggest[s] ascending from the [restrictive] to the [general] in a speech.\u201d<ref>[[Tobias Reinhardt|Reinhardt, Tobias]].

In [[De Inventione]], Cicero had outlined a technical idea of rhetoric based on the handbooks of his era. But as he aged, his view changed to an \u201call-encompassing\u201d ideal modeled on [[Philo of Larissa|Philo]]\u2019s rhetorical teachings. Previous to and during Cicero\u2019s lifetime, there was a quarrel between rhetoricians and philosophers over whether rhetoric was restricted to only the forensic and technical sphere, or if it included the abstract and philosophical realm. \u201cSpecifically, Cicero suggest[s] ascending from the [restrictive] to the [general] in a speech.\u201d<ref>[[Tobias Reinhardt|Reinhardt, Tobias]]. The Classical Quarterly. Vol. 50. Ch. Rhetoric in the Fourth  Academy. pg. 531-535. The Classical Association. Great Britain: Cambridge University Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nThis work thus merges rhetoric as a more simplistic, teachable art with the themes of [[De Oratore]], praising the ideal orator who appreciates and utilizes expansive education and training.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{wikisourcelang-inline|la|De Partitione Oratoria}}\n* [http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/734/87667] A free, online edition of the text.\n\n{{Cicero}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dialogue Concerning Oratorical Partitions}}\n[[Category:Rhetoric works]]\n[[Category:Works by Cicero on oratory]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toBC(link changed toBefore Christ; link changed toBefore Christ) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dialogue_Concerning_Oratorical_Partitions"}
