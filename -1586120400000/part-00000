It was known for being the location of the \"[[Summer White Houses]]\" during the administrations of Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[John F. Kennedy]]. The population was 24,672 as of 2010.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Newport, Rhode Island}}\n\n===Colonial period===\n\n[[File:Newport, R.I. in 1730 (NYPL Hades-254162-478731).jpg|thumb|right|''Newport, R.I. in 1730'', [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Newport,_R.I._in_1730_(NYPL_Hades-254162-478731).jpg New York Public Library]]]\nNewport was founded in 1639 on [[Aquidneck Island]], which was called Rhode Island at the time. Its eight founders and first officers were [[Nicholas Easton]], [[William Coddington]], [[John Clarke (Baptist minister)|John Clarke]], [[John Coggeshall]], [[William Brenton]], [[Jeremy Clarke (Governor)|Jeremy Clark]], [[Thomas Hazard]], and [[Henry Bull (Governor)|Henry Bull]]. Many of these people had been part of the settlement at [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]], along with [[Anne Hutchinson]] and her followers. They separated within a year of that settlement, however, and Coddington and others began the settlement of Newport on the southern side of the island.\n\nNewport grew to be the largest of the four original settlements which became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which also included [[Providence Plantations]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Shawomett]]. Many of the first colonists in Newport became [[Baptists]], and the second Baptist congregation in Rhode Island was formed in 1640 under the leadership of John Clarke.  In 1658, a group of Jews were welcomed to settle in Newport; they were fleeing the [[Inquisition]] in Spain and Portugal but had not been permitted to settle elsewhere. The Newport congregation is now referred to as Congregation Jeshuat Israel and is the second-oldest Jewish congregation in the United States. It meets in [[Touro Synagogue]], the oldest synagogue in the United States.\n\nThe Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations received its royal charter in 1663, and [[Benedict Arnold (governor)|Benedict Arnold]] was elected as its first governor at Newport. The [[Old Colony House]] served as a seat of Rhode Island's government upon its completion in 1741 at the head of [[Washington Square (Newport, Rhode Island)|Washington Square]], until the current [[Rhode Island State House]] in Providence was completed in 1904 and Providence became the state's sole capital city. Newport became the most important port in colonial Rhode Island, and a public school was established in 1640.\n\nThe commercial activity which raised Newport to its fame as a rich port was begun by a second wave of Portuguese Jews who settled there around the middle of the 18th century. They had been practicing Judaism in secret for 300 years in Portugal, and they were attracted to Rhode Island because of the freedom of worship there. They brought with them commercial experience and connections, capital, and a spirit of enterprise. Most prominent among those were Jacob Rodrigues Rivera, who arrived in 1745 (died 1789) and [[Aaron Lopez]], who came in 1752 (died May 28, 1782). Rivera introduced the manufacture of [[sperm oil]] which became one of Newport's leading industries and made the town rich. Newport developed 17 manufactories of oil and candles and enjoyed a practical monopoly of this trade until the [[American Revolution]].\n\nAaron Lopez is credited with making Newport an important center of trade.<ref>''Settlement of the Jews in North America''.

In 1732, he published the first newspaper, the ''Rhode Island Gazette''. In 1758, his son James founded the weekly newspaper ''Mercury''. The famous 18th century [[Goddard and Townsend]] furniture was also made in Newport.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, Newport suffered from an imbalance of trade with the largest colonial ports.  As a result, Newport merchants were forced to develop alternatives to conventional exports.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tunnell |first=Daniel L. |author2=Hechtlinger, Adelaide |title=Life in Newport Part II: The Eighteenth Century |journal=Early American Life |pages=26\u201331 |date=April 1975}}</ref> In the 1720s, Colonial leaders arrested many pirates, acting under pressure from the British government. Many were hanged in Newport and were buried on [[Goat Island, Rhode Island|Goat Island]].\n\n===Slave trade===\nNewport was a major center of the [[slave trade]] in colonial and early America, active in the [[Atlantic slave trade#Triangular trade|\"triangle trade\"]] in which slave-produced sugar and molasses from the Caribbean were carried to Rhode Island and distilled into [[rum]], which was then carried to West Africa and exchanged for captives. In 1764, Rhode Island had about 30 rum distilleries, 22 in Newport alone. The [[Common Burial Ground]] on Farewell Street was where most of the slaves were buried.\n\nSixty percent of slave-trading voyages launched from North America issued from tiny Rhode Island, in some years more than 90%, and many from Newport. Almost half were trafficked illegally, breaking a 1787 state law prohibiting residents of the state from trading in slaves. Slave traders were also breaking federal statutes of 1794 and 1800 barring Americans from carrying slaves to ports outside the United States, as well as the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|1807 Congressional act]] abolishing the transatlantic slave trade. A few Rhode Island families made substantial fortunes in the trade. [[William Vernon|William]] and Samuel Vernon were Newport merchants who later played an important role in financing the creation of the United States Navy; they sponsored 30 African slaving ventures. However, it was the DeWolfs of [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], and most notably [[James De Wolf]], who were the largest slave-trading family in all of North America, mounting more than 80 transatlantic voyages, most of them illegal. The Rhode Island slave trade was broadly based. Seven hundred Rhode Islanders owned or captained slave ships, including most substantial merchants, and many ordinary shopkeepers and tradesmen who purchased shares in slaving voyages.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.brown.edu/Research/Slavery_Justice/documents/SlaveryAndJustice.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330161220/http://www.brown.edu/Research/Slavery_Justice/documents/SlaveryAndJustice.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to being one of America's most active slave ports, Newport was also home to a small community of abolitionists and free blacks.

Rider |author1= Vernon, Thomas |author2= Rider, Sidney Smith |author3= Ellery, Harrison |author4= Greene, George Sears |year= 1879 }}</ref> In the fall of 1776, the British saw that Newport could be used as a naval base to attack New York (which they had recently occupied), so they took over the city.  The population of Newport had divided loyalties.  Many pro\u2013independence Patriots left town, while loyalist Tories remained.  Newport was a British stronghold for the next three years.\n\nIn the summer of 1778, the Americans began the campaign known as the [[Battle of Rhode Island]]. This was the first joint operation between the Americans and the French after the signing of the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]]. The Americans based in [[Tiverton, Rhode Island|Tiverton]] planned a formal [[siege]] of the town. However, the French refused to take part in it, wanting a frontal assault.  This weakened the American position, and the British were able to expel the Americans from the island. The following year, the British abandoned Newport, wanting to concentrate their forces in New York.\n\nOn July 10, 1780, [[Exp\u00e9dition Particuli\u00e8re|a French expedition]] arrived in [[Narragansett Bay]] off Newport with an army of 450 officers and 5,300 men, sent by [[King Louis XVI]] and commanded by [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]].  For the rest of the war, Newport was the base of the French forces in the United States.  In July 1781, Rochambeau was finally able to leave Newport for [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] to begin the [[Washington\u2013Rochambeau Revolutionary Route|decisive march]] to [[Yorktown, Virginia]], along with General [[George Washington]]. The first Roman [[Catholic mass]] in Rhode Island was said in Newport during this time. The [[Rochambeau Monument (Newport, RI)|Rochambeau Monument]] in Kings Park on Wellington Avenue along Newport Harbor commemorates Rochambeau's contributions to the Revolutionary War and to Newport's history.\n\nNewport's population had fallen from over 9,000 (according to the census of 1774) to fewer than 4,000 by the time that the war ended (1783). Over 200 abandoned buildings were torn down in the 1780s. Also, the war destroyed Newport's economic wealth, as years of military occupation closed the city to any form of trade.

Many of the homes were designed by New York architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]], who kept a house in Newport himself.\n\nThe social scene at Newport is described in [[Edith Wharton]]'s novel ''[[The Age of Innocence]]''. Wharton's own Newport \"cottage\" was called ''Land's End.'' Today, many mansions continue in private use. [[Hammersmith Farm]] is the mansion where [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Jackie Kennedy]] held their wedding reception; it was open to tourists as a \"house museum\", but has since been purchased and reconverted into a private residence. Many other mansions are open to tourists; still others were converted into academic buildings for [[Salve Regina College]] in the 1930s, when the owners could no longer afford their tax bills.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a large number of [[Irish immigrants]] settled in Newport. The Fifth Ward of Newport in the southern part of the city became a staunch Irish neighborhood for many generations. To this day, St. Patrick's Day is an important day of pride and celebration in Newport, with a large parade going down Thames Street.\n\nThe oldest Catholic parish in Rhode Island is [[St. Mary's Church Complex (Newport, Rhode Island)|St. Mary's]], located on Spring Street\u2014though the current building is not the original one.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:The Breakers Newport.jpg|[[The Breakers]], 2009\nFile:Hypotenuse.jpg|\"Hypotenuse\", Newport home of architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]]\n</gallery>\n\n===20th century and beyond===\nRhode Island did not have a fixed capital during and after the colonial era but rotated its legislative sessions among Providence, Newport, Bristol, East Greenwich, and South Kingstown. In 1854, the sessions were eliminated in the cities other than Providence and Newport, and Newport was finally dropped in 1900.

It held the campus of the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] during the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) when the undergraduate officer training school was temporarily moved north from [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. From 1952 to 1973, it hosted the Cruiser-Destroyer Force of the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|U.S. Atlantic Fleet]], and subsequently it has hosted smaller numbers of warships from time to time. Today it hosts the [[Naval Station Newport]] (NAVSTA Newport) and remains home to the U.S. [[Naval War College]] and the [[Naval Education and Training Command]] (NETC), the center for [[Surface Warfare Officer]] training, numerous other schools, and the headquarters of the [[Naval Undersea Warfare Center]]. The [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60}} was moored in an inactive status at the docks previously used by the Cruiser-Destroyer Force, until it was towed to Brownsville, Texas in August\u2013September 2014 to be dismantled.

The population of Newport decreased, businesses closed, and property values plummeted. However, in the late 1960s, the city began revitalizing the downtown area with the construction of America's Cup Avenue, malls of stores and condominiums, and upscale hotels. Construction was completed on the [[Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge|Newport Bridge]]. The [[Preservation Society of Newport County]] began opening Newport's historic mansions to the public, and the tourist industry became Newport's primary commercial enterprise over the subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/rhodeislandhistory/chapt8.html |title= Rhode Island History |publisher= Rhode Island General Assembly |access-date= 2008-05-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070829045227/http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/RhodeIslandHistory/chapt8.html |archive-date= 2007-08-29 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n[[File:Newport shoreline of Easton Bay looking south from cliffside overlook at east end of Narragansett Ave.JPG|right|thumb|Shoreline of the [[Easton Bay]] looking south from cliffside at east end of Narragansett Avenue]]\n\nNewport is located at {{Coord|41|29|17|N|71|18|45|W|}}.

It was known for being the location of the \"[[Summer White Houses]]\" during the administrations of Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[John F. Kennedy]]. The population was 24,672 as of 2010.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Newport, Rhode Island}}\n\n===Colonial period===\n\n[[File:Newport, R.I. in 1730 (NYPL Hades-254162-478731).jpg|thumb|right|''Newport, R.I. in 1730'', [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Newport,_R.I._in_1730_(NYPL_Hades-254162-478731).jpg New York Public Library]]]\nNewport was founded in 1639 on [[Aquidneck Island]], which was called Rhode Island at the time. Its eight founders and first officers were [[Nicholas Easton]], [[William Coddington]], [[John Clarke (Baptist minister)|John Clarke]], [[John Coggeshall]], [[William Brenton]], [[Jeremy Clarke (Governor)|Jeremy Clark]], [[Thomas Hazard]], and [[Henry Bull (Governor)|Henry Bull]]. Many of these people had been part of the settlement at [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]], along with [[Anne Hutchinson]] and her followers. They separated within a year of that settlement, however, and Coddington and others began the settlement of Newport on the southern side of the island.\n\nNewport grew to be the largest of the four original settlements which became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which also included [[Providence Plantations]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Shawomett]]. Many of the first colonists in Newport became [[Baptists]], and the second Baptist congregation in Rhode Island was formed in 1640 under the leadership of John Clarke.  In 1658, a group of Jews were welcomed to settle in Newport; they were fleeing the [[Inquisition]] in Spain and Portugal but had not been permitted to settle elsewhere. The Newport congregation is now referred to as Congregation Jeshuat Israel and is the second-oldest Jewish congregation in the United States. It meets in [[Touro Synagogue]], the oldest synagogue in the United States.\n\nThe Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations received its royal charter in 1663, and [[Benedict Arnold (governor)|Benedict Arnold]] was elected as its first governor at Newport. The [[Old Colony House]] served as a seat of Rhode Island's government upon its completion in 1741 at the head of [[Washington Square (Newport, Rhode Island)|Washington Square]], until the current [[Rhode Island State House]] in Providence was completed in 1904 and Providence became the state's sole capital city. Newport became the most important port in colonial Rhode Island, and a public school was established in 1640.\n\nThe commercial activity which raised Newport to its fame as a rich port was begun by a second wave of Portuguese Jews who settled there around the middle of the 18th century. They had been practicing Judaism in secret for 300 years in Portugal, and they were attracted to Rhode Island because of the freedom of worship there. They brought with them commercial experience and connections, capital, and a spirit of enterprise. Most prominent among those were Jacob Rodrigues Rivera, who arrived in 1745 (died 1789) and [[Aaron Lopez]], who came in 1752 (died May 28, 1782). Rivera introduced the manufacture of [[sperm oil]] which became one of Newport's leading industries and made the town rich. Newport developed 17 manufactories of oil and candles and enjoyed a practical monopoly of this trade until the [[American Revolution]].\n\nAaron Lopez is credited with making Newport an important center of trade.<ref>''Settlement of the Jews in North America''.

In 1732, he published the first newspaper, the ''Rhode Island Gazette''. In 1758, his son James founded the weekly newspaper ''Mercury''. The famous 18th century [[Goddard and Townsend]] furniture was also made in Newport.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, Newport suffered from an imbalance of trade with the largest colonial ports.  As a result, Newport merchants were forced to develop alternatives to conventional exports.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tunnell |first=Daniel L. |author2=Hechtlinger, Adelaide |title=Life in Newport Part II: The Eighteenth Century |journal=Early American Life |pages=26\u201331 |date=April 1975}}</ref> In the 1720s, Colonial leaders arrested many pirates, acting under pressure from the British government. Many were hanged in Newport and were buried on [[Goat Island, Rhode Island|Goat Island]].\n\n===Slave trade===\nNewport was a major center of the [[slave trade]] in colonial and early America, active in the [[Atlantic slave trade#Triangular trade|\"triangle trade\"]] in which slave-produced sugar and molasses from the Caribbean were carried to Rhode Island and distilled into [[rum]], which was then carried to West Africa and exchanged for captives. In 1764, Rhode Island had about 30 rum distilleries, 22 in Newport alone. The [[Common Burial Ground]] on Farewell Street was where most of the slaves were buried.\n\nSixty percent of slave-trading voyages launched from North America issued from tiny Rhode Island, in some years more than 90%, and many from Newport. Almost half were trafficked illegally, breaking a 1787 state law prohibiting residents of the state from trading in slaves. Slave traders were also breaking federal statutes of 1794 and 1800 barring Americans from carrying slaves to ports outside the United States, as well as the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|1807 Congressional act]] abolishing the transatlantic slave trade. A few Rhode Island families made substantial fortunes in the trade. [[William Vernon|William]] and Samuel Vernon were Newport merchants who later played an important role in financing the creation of the United States Navy; they sponsored 30 African slaving ventures. However, it was the DeWolfs of [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], and most notably [[James De Wolf]], who were the largest slave-trading family in all of North America, mounting more than 80 transatlantic voyages, most of them illegal. The Rhode Island slave trade was broadly based. Seven hundred Rhode Islanders owned or captained slave ships, including most substantial merchants, and many ordinary shopkeepers and tradesmen who purchased shares in slaving voyages.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.brown.edu/Research/Slavery_Justice/documents/SlaveryAndJustice.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330161220/http://www.brown.edu/Research/Slavery_Justice/documents/SlaveryAndJustice.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to being one of America's most active slave ports, Newport was also home to a small community of abolitionists and free blacks.

The population of Newport had divided loyalties.  Many pro\u2013independence Patriots left town, while loyalist Tories remained.  Newport was a British stronghold for the next three years.\n\nIn the summer of 1778, the Americans began the campaign known as the [[Battle of Rhode Island]]. This was the first joint operation between the Americans and the French after the signing of the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]]. The Americans based in [[Tiverton, Rhode Island|Tiverton]] planned a formal [[siege]] of the town. However, the French refused to take part in it, wanting a frontal assault.  This weakened the American position, and the British were able to expel the Americans from the island. The following year, the British abandoned Newport, wanting to concentrate their forces in New York.\n\nOn July 10, 1780, [[Exp\u00e9dition Particuli\u00e8re|a French expedition]] arrived in [[Narragansett Bay]] off Newport with an army of 450 officers and 5,300 men, sent by [[King Louis XVI]] and commanded by [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]].  For the rest of the war, Newport was the base of the French forces in the United States.  In July 1781, Rochambeau was finally able to leave Newport for [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] to begin the [[Washington\u2013Rochambeau Revolutionary Route|decisive march]] to [[Yorktown, Virginia]], along with General [[George Washington]]. The first Roman [[Catholic mass]] in Rhode Island was said in Newport during this time. The [[Rochambeau Monument (Newport, RI)|Rochambeau Monument]] in Kings Park on Wellington Avenue along Newport Harbor commemorates Rochambeau's contributions to the Revolutionary War and to Newport's history.\n\nNewport's population had fallen from over 9,000 (according to the census of 1774) to fewer than 4,000 by the time that the war ended (1783). Over 200 abandoned buildings were torn down in the 1780s. Also, the war destroyed Newport's economic wealth, as years of military occupation closed the city to any form of trade. The Newport merchants moved away, some to Providence, others to [[Boston]] and New York.\n\nIt was in Newport that the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]] voted to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in 1790 and become the 13th state, acting under pressure from the merchant community of Providence.\n\nThe city was the last residence of Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] and the birthplace of Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] and the Reverend [[William Ellery Channing]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"154px\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\" caption=\"\">\nFile:Rochambeau statue, Newport, Rhode Island, USA.JPG|[[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] statue in Kings park\nFile:NewportRICityHall.JPG|Newport's City Hall\n</gallery>\n\n===Gilded Age===\nBeginning in the mid-nineteenth century, wealthy southern planters seeking to escape the heat began to build summer cottages on Bellevue Avenue, such as [[Kingscote (mansion)|Kingscote]] (1839).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tickets.newportmansions.org/mansion.aspx?id=1009 |title= Kingscote |publisher= The Preservation Society of Newport County |access-date= 2007-02-19 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070204234952/http://tickets.newportmansions.org/mansion.aspx?id=1009 |archive-date= 2007-02-04 |url-status= live }}</ref>  Around the middle of the century, wealthy [[Yankee]]s, such as the Wetmore family, also began constructing larger mansions, such as [[Chateau-sur-Mer]] (1852) nearby.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tickets.newportmansions.org/mansion.aspx?id=1005 |title= Chateau-sur-Mer |publisher= The Preservation Society of Newport County |access-date= 2007-02-19 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070204235050/http://tickets.newportmansions.org/mansion.aspx?id=1005 |archive-date= 2007-02-04 |url-status= live }}</ref> Most of these early families made a substantial part of their fortunes in the [[Old China Trade]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-16998520.html |title= Newport and the Far East.

Many of the homes were designed by New York architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]], who kept a house in Newport himself.\n\nThe social scene at Newport is described in [[Edith Wharton]]'s novel ''[[The Age of Innocence]]''. Wharton's own Newport \"cottage\" was called ''Land's End.'' Today, many mansions continue in private use. [[Hammersmith Farm]] is the mansion where [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Jackie Kennedy]] held their wedding reception; it was open to tourists as a \"house museum\", but has since been purchased and reconverted into a private residence. Many other mansions are open to tourists; still others were converted into academic buildings for [[Salve Regina College]] in the 1930s, when the owners could no longer afford their tax bills.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a large number of [[Irish immigrants]] settled in Newport. The Fifth Ward of Newport in the southern part of the city became a staunch Irish neighborhood for many generations. To this day, St. Patrick's Day is an important day of pride and celebration in Newport, with a large parade going down Thames Street.\n\nThe oldest Catholic parish in Rhode Island is [[St. Mary's Church Complex (Newport, Rhode Island)|St. Mary's]], located on Spring Street\u2014though the current building is not the original one.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:The Breakers Newport.jpg|[[The Breakers]], 2009\nFile:Hypotenuse.jpg|\"Hypotenuse\", Newport home of architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]]\n</gallery>\n\n===20th century and beyond===\nRhode Island did not have a fixed capital during and after the colonial era but rotated its legislative sessions among Providence, Newport, Bristol, East Greenwich, and South Kingstown.

It held the campus of the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] during the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) when the undergraduate officer training school was temporarily moved north from [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. From 1952 to 1973, it hosted the Cruiser-Destroyer Force of the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|U.S. Atlantic Fleet]], and subsequently it has hosted smaller numbers of warships from time to time. Today it hosts the [[Naval Station Newport]] (NAVSTA Newport) and remains home to the U.S. [[Naval War College]] and the [[Naval Education and Training Command]] (NETC), the center for [[Surface Warfare Officer]] training, numerous other schools, and the headquarters of the [[Naval Undersea Warfare Center]]. The [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60}} was moored in an inactive status at the docks previously used by the Cruiser-Destroyer Force, until it was towed to Brownsville, Texas in August\u2013September 2014 to be dismantled. The {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59}} shared the pier until June 2010.{{citation needed|date = September 2014}}\n\nThe departure of the Cruiser-Destroyer fleet from Newport and the closure of nearby [[Naval Air Station Quonset Point]] in 1973 were devastating to the local economy. The population of Newport decreased, businesses closed, and property values plummeted. However, in the late 1960s, the city began revitalizing the downtown area with the construction of America's Cup Avenue, malls of stores and condominiums, and upscale hotels. Construction was completed on the [[Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge|Newport Bridge]]. The [[Preservation Society of Newport County]] began opening Newport's historic mansions to the public, and the tourist industry became Newport's primary commercial enterprise over the subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/rhodeislandhistory/chapt8.html |title= Rhode Island History |publisher= Rhode Island General Assembly |access-date= 2008-05-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070829045227/http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/RhodeIslandHistory/chapt8.html |archive-date= 2007-08-29 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n[[File:Newport shoreline of Easton Bay looking south from cliffside overlook at east end of Narragansett Ave.JPG|right|thumb|Shoreline of the [[Easton Bay]] looking south from cliffside at east end of Narragansett Avenue]]\n\nNewport is located at {{Coord|41|29|17|N|71|18|45|W|}}.

Between 1943\u201345, he successively commanded the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]], [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]], [[Fifteenth United States Army|Fifteenth Army]] and [[United States Army North|Fifth Army]]. He was, along with [[Alexander Patch]] and [[James Van Fleet]], among the few U.S. Army officers to command a [[Division (military)|division]], a [[corps]], and a [[field army]] on active service during the war.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and military career===\nTruscott was born in [[Chatfield, Texas]] on January 6, 1895, a son of Dr. Lucian King Truscott (1861-1922) and Maria Temple Tully (1866-1938).  Raised primarily in [[Oklahoma]], he attended grade school and a year of high school in the hamlet of Stella, near [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]].  At age 16, he claimed to be 18 and a high school graduate to qualify for teacher training, attended the summer term of the state [[normal school]] in Norman, and received his teaching certification.  He taught school before he decided to join the [[United States Army]] in 1917. Enlisting during the [[American entry into World War I]], Truscott applied for officer training, falsely claiming to be a high school graduate who had completed the equivalent of a year of college.  After completing the officer training camp at [[Fort Logan H. Roots]], he was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry Branch]]. During the war, he remained in the United States to patrol the border with Mexico, and served with the [[17th Cavalry Regiment]] at [[Camp Harry J. Jones]], [[Douglas, Arizona]].\n\n[[File:Lucian Truscott 6.jpg|thumb|left|Truscott pictured here as a [[Captain (United States)|captain]] sometime during the [[interwar period]].]]\n\nHe served in various cavalry and staff assignments [[Interwar period|between the wars]], including completion of the Cavalry Officers Course, followed by assignment as a Cavalry School instructor, and graduation from the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]], followed by assignment to the school's faculty. He married Sarah \"Chick\" Nicholas Randolph, a descendant of [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]] and [[Thomas Nelson Jr.]], on 27 March 1919.\n\n===World War II===\nIn 1942, Truscott, now a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], was instrumental in developing an American commando unit patterned after the [[British Commandos]]. The American unit was activated by Truscott (newly promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on June 19, 1942) as the [[1st Ranger Battalion (United States)|1st Ranger Battalion]], and placed under the command of [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[William Orlando Darby]].\n\nIn May 1942, Truscott was assigned to the Allied Combined Staff under Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] and in August, he was the primary U.S. observer on the [[Dieppe Raid]]. The raid was primarily a Canadian operation, consisting of elements of the [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division]], with two British Commandos attached along with a 50-man detachment from the 1st Ranger Battalion. The Rangers were assigned to [[No. 3 Commando]], [[No. 4 Commando]], and 6 Rangers were spread out among the Canadian regiments. This was considered the first action by American troops against [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] in World War II.<ref name=hh>{{cite web| last=Houterman | first=Hans | title=US Army Officers 1939-1945 | work=WWII unit histories | url=http://www.unithistories.com/units_index/default.asp?file=../officers/officers_american.html | accessdate=4 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn July 1942, Truscott was appointed to the staff of [[IX Corps (United States)|IX Corps]] Area, at [[Fort Lewis]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref name=hh />  On November 8, 1942, now a [[two-star rank|two-star]] [[Major general (United States)|major general]], Truscott led the 9,000 men of the [[60th Infantry Regiment (United States)|60th Infantry Regiment]] (part of the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]]) and [[66th Armor Regiment (United States)|66th Armored Regiment]] (part of the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]]) in the landings at [[Mehdia]] and [[Kenitra|Port Lyautey]] in [[Morocco]], part of [[Operation Torch]] under Major General [[George S. Patton]].<ref name=Atkinson-Rick-AAatD>[[Rick Atkinson|Atkinson, Rick]]. ''[[An Army at Dawn]]''. New York: Henry Holt and Company. pp. 111, 141\u2013148. {{ISBN|0-8050-7448-1}}</ref>\n\nTruscott took command of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] in March 1943, and oversaw preparations for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], codenamed Operation Husky. He was known as a very tough trainer, bringing the 3rd Infantry Division up to a very high standard. At the age of 48, he was one of the youngest division commanders in the U.S. Army at the time. He led the division in the assault on Sicily in July 1943, coming under the command of the [[Seventh United States Army|Seventh U.S. Army]], commanded by Patton, now a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]]. Here his training paid off when the division covered great distances in the mountainous terrain at high speed. The famous 'Truscott Trot' was a marching pace of five miles per hour over the first mile, thereafter four miles per hour, much faster than the usual standard of 2.5 miles per hour. The 3rd Infantry Division was considered to be the best-trained, best-led division in the Seventh Army.\n\nAfter a brief rest to absorb replacements the division, in mid-September, nine days after the [[Allied invasion of Italy|initial Allied landings]] at Salerno, Italy, came ashore on the Italian mainland, where it [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|fought its way up the Italian peninsula]], under the command of the [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]], commanded by Major General [[John P. Lucas]]. The VI Corps was part of Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]]'s [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]]. After crossing the [[Volturno Line]] in October and fighting in severe winter weather around the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]], which saw heavy casualties sustained, the division was pulled out of the line for rest and relaxation.\n\n[[File:The commander of the Allied Armies in Italy, General Sir Harold Alexander, with American General Truscott, in charge of the Allied bridgehead at Anzio, 4 March 1944.

Alexander]], [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI), with Major General Lucian K. Truscott Jr., commander of the U.S. VI Corps, in the Anzio beachhead, Italy, 4 March 1944.]]\n\nIn January 1944, the division [[Battle of Anzio|assaulted Anzio]] as part of the U.S. VI Corps, which also included the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Infantry Division]], along with two British Commandos and three battalions of [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Rangers]], Combat Command B of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] and the [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|504th Parachute Regimental Combat Team]]. The operation, the brainchild of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], was intended to outflank, and potentially force the Germans to withdraw from their Winter Line defenses, which had considerably slowed Allied progress in Italy.\n\nLucas, the corps commander, initially decided not to push inland, as Allied commanders had intended, and Truscott's 3rd Division was soon engaged in bitter fighting and, again, suffering heavy losses as the Germans launched numerous [[counterattack]]s to drive the Allies into the sea. With Clark, the Fifth Army commander, and [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander]], [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI), growing increasingly worried about the situation, Truscott was appointed as Lucas's deputy commander and, after Lucas was dismissed on 17 February, was given command of the VI Corps. Truscott was succeeded in command of the 3rd Infantry Division by Major General [[John W. O'Daniel|John \"Iron Mike\" O'Daniel]], previously the Assistant Division Commander (ADC). At the age of 49, Truscott was the second youngest corps commander in the U.S. Army, behind only [[J. Lawton Collins]], then commanding [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] in England. Clark, writing in his memoirs after the war, claimed that he \"selected Truscott to become the new VI Corps commander because of all the division commanders available to me in the Anzio [[bridgehead]] who were familiar with the situation he was the most outstanding. A quiet, competent, and courageous officer with great battle experience through North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, he inspired confidence in all with whom he came in contact.\"<ref>General Mark W. Clark, Calculated Risk, p. 244-245</ref>\n\nFollowing Anzio, Truscott continued to command VI Corps through the fighting up the Italian boot, helping in the final [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] and the subsequent capture of Rome, just two days before the [[Normandy landings]]. However, his command was then withdrawn from the line to prepare for [[Operation Dragoon]], the amphibious assault on southern France.\n\nOn 15 August 1944, the VI Corps landed in southern France and initially faced relatively little opposition. The rapid retreat of the [[19th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Nineteenth Army]] resulted in swift gains for the Allied forces. The invasion plan was initially for US forces to conduct the initial landing, and Free French forces to conduct the breakout. This was changed to exploit the withdrawal of the German 19th Army, and US 6th Corps began a pursuit. This resulted in cutting off the escape of the enemy, and their total destruction or capture. The ''Dragoon'' force met up with southern thrusts from [[Operation Overlord]] in mid-September, near [[Dijon]].\n\n[[File:Capt. Richard Wolfer receiving Bronze Star from Gen. Truscott in France.jpg|thumb|left|Truscott pins the Bronze Star on Captain Richard Wolfer, France, 25 October 1944.]]\n\nA planned benefit of ''Dragoon'' was the usefulness of the port of [[Marseille]]. The rapid Allied advance after [[Operation Cobra]] and ''Dragoon'' slowed almost to a halt in September 1944 due to a critical lack of supplies, as thousands of tons of supplies were shunted to northwest France to compensate for the inadequacies of port facilities and land transport in northern Europe. Marseille and the southern French railways were brought back into service despite heavy damage to the port of Marseille and its railroad trunk lines. They became a significant supply route for the Allied advance into Germany, providing about a third of the Allied needs.\n\nOn 2 September 1944, Truscott was promoted to the [[three-star rank]] of lieutenant general and in October he was appointed commander of the newly formed [[Fifteenth United States Army|Fifteenth Army]], which was largely an administrative and training command.<ref>Jeffers. p. 217</ref>\n\n[[File:Co.

Truscott led the Fifth Army through the hard winter of 1944\u20131945, where many of its formations were in exposed positions in the mountains of Italy. He then led the army through the Allied [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy]] culminating in the final destruction of the German forces in Italy.\n\n===Post-war era===\nTruscott took over command of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] from [[General (United States)|General]] [[George S. Patton]] on 8 October 1945, and led it until April 1946. This command included the Eastern Military District of the U.S. occupation zone of Germany, which consisted primarily of the state of [[Bavaria]]. When the [[Seventh United States Army|Seventh Army]] was deactivated in March 1946, Truscott's Third Army took over the Western Military District (the U.S.-occupied parts of [[Baden]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[People's State of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]]).\n\n[[Will Lang Jr.]] from ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' wrote a biography on Truscott that appeared in the October 2, 1944, issue of that magazine.\n\nAfter leaving the U.S. Army, Truscott began work on his book ''Command Missions'', which was published in 1954 ({{ISBN|0-89141-364-2}}), and ''The Twilight of the U.S. Cavalry'' ({{ISBN|0-7006-0932-6}}). The latter book was published after his death by his son, Lucian III, in 1989.<ref name=\"Jeffers, p. 302\">Jeffers, p. 302.</ref> In 1954, Congress passed Public Law 83-508, which promoted several World War II senior officers who had exercised responsibilities greater than their rank; as a numbered army commander, Truscott carried out the duties of a [[four-star rank|four-star]] general, and the 1954 law promoted him to [[General (United States)|general]] on the retired list.<ref name=\"Jeffers, p. 302\"/>\n\nTruscott helped evaluate officers as a member of the War Department Screening Board. Then in 1948\u20131949, he spent a year as the Chairman of the Army Advisory Board for Amphibious Operations, at [[Fort Monroe]], Virginia. It was between meetings of this board that he began assembling the material for his two books.<ref>Jeffers, p. 283.</ref>\n\n===Central Intelligence Agency===\nIn 1951, [[Walter Bedell Smith]], Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), appointed Truscott as \"Special Consultant to the United States Commissioner\" in Frankfurt, Germany. However, this was simply a cover for his real assignment as senior Central Intelligence Agency representative in Germany. Truscott had been placed in charge of cloak-and-dagger operations in a vital part of Europe. This only came to light after declassification of a secret memorandum in 1994.<ref>Jeffers, p. 287.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, President Eisenhower approved CIA Director Allen Dulles' recommendation that General Truscott be appointed the CIA's Deputy Director for Coordination. This appointment meant that Truscott was now controlling the agency's rapidly expanding network of agents worldwide. His responsibilities included facilitating the overthrow of governments in Iran and Guatemala.<ref>Frederick W. Marks, III, and Stephen G. Rabe, \"The CIA and Castillo Armas in Guatemala, 1954: New Clues to an Old Puzzle,\" ''Diplomatic History'' (1990) 14#1 pp 67-86.</ref> Truscott was involved in planning [[Operation PBSUCCESS]], the CIA mission to overthrow Guatemalan President Jacobo \u00c1rbenz. According to Harry Jeffers' biography, Truscott was instrumental in convincing Eisenhower to support PBSUCCESS with air power.<ref>Jeffers, ch. 20</ref> However, another biography by William Heefner suggests that specifics of Truscott's involvement cannot be substantiated.<ref>Heefner, p. 339.</ref>\n\nTruscott left the CIA in 1958. He wrote nothing about his service in the CIA in ''Command Missions'', and there is nothing about his CIA activities in his papers at the George C. Marshall Library.<ref>Jeffers, pp. 292\u2013298.</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\nTruscott died on 12 September 1965, in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].<ref name=\"Arlington\">{{cite web| url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/lktruscott.htm| work=Arlington National Cemetery website| title=Lucian King Truscott Jr. | accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> On 29 April 1966, Truscott Hall, a bachelor officers' quarters at the United States Army War College, was named after him. On 17 August 1974,<ref name=\"Arlington\"/> Sarah Truscott, his wife, died and was buried next to him at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref>Jeffers, p  308.</ref>\n\nIn 2012, he was honored at his birthplace of Chatfield.<ref>Jacobs, Janet, [http://corsicanadailysun.com/local/x594870717/Historical-marker-honoring-local-veteran-dedicated \"Historical marker honoring local veteran dedicated\"], ''[[Corsicana Daily Sun]]'', January 9, 2012</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nTruscott had a very gravelly voice, said to be the result of an accidental ingestion of acid in childhood. He was superstitious about his clothing, and usually wore a leather jacket, [[United States Army Air Forces#Service dress|\"pink\" pants]] and lucky boots in combat. He also wore a white scarf as a trademark, first during the Sicilian campaign.<ref name=\"Arlington\"/>\n\nTruscott once said to his son, \"Let me tell you something, and don't ever forget it. You play games to win, not lose. And you fight wars to win. That's spelled W-I-N!  And every good player in a game and every good commander in a war\u2026has to have some son of a bitch in him. If he doesn't, he isn't a good player or commander....It's as simple as that. No son of a bitch, no commander.\"<ref name=\"Arlington\"/>\n\nTruscott was respected by his subordinates. A medical officer in the Seventh Army related stories he'd heard from the men who served under Truscott earlier. Unlike some commanders, Truscott was not noted for self-aggrandisement,<ref name=\"Phibbs201\">Phibbs, p. 201</ref>{{Refn|group=note|\"\u2026 Truscott's absolute exclusion of his name from dispatches.

Between 1943\u201345, he successively commanded the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]], [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]], [[Fifteenth United States Army|Fifteenth Army]] and [[United States Army North|Fifth Army]]. He was, along with [[Alexander Patch]] and [[James Van Fleet]], among the few U.S. Army officers to command a [[Division (military)|division]], a [[corps]], and a [[field army]] on active service during the war.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and military career===\nTruscott was born in [[Chatfield, Texas]], to an [[England|English]] father and an [[Ireland|Irish]] mother.  Raised primarily in [[Oklahoma]], he attended grade school and a year of high school in the hamlet of Stella, near [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]].  At age 16, he claimed to be 18 and a high school graduate to qualify for teacher training, attended the summer term of the state [[normal school]] in Norman, and received his teaching certification.  He taught school before he decided to join the [[United States Army]] in 1917. Enlisting during the [[American entry into World War I]], Truscott applied for officer training, falsely claiming to be a high school graduate who had completed the equivalent of a year of college.  After completing the officer training camp at [[Fort Logan H. Roots]], he was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry Branch]]. During the war, he remained in the United States to patrol the border with Mexico, and served with the [[17th Cavalry Regiment]] at [[Camp Harry J. Jones]], [[Douglas, Arizona]].\n\n[[File:Lucian Truscott 6.jpg|thumb|left|Truscott pictured here as a [[Captain (United States)|captain]] sometime during the [[interwar period]].]]\n\nHe served in various cavalry and staff assignments [[Interwar period|between the wars]], including completion of the Cavalry Officers Course, followed by assignment as a Cavalry School instructor, and graduation from the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]], followed by assignment to the school's faculty. He married Sarah \"Chick\" Nicholas Randolph, a descendant of [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]] and [[Thomas Nelson Jr.]], on 27 March 1919.\n\n===World War II===\nIn 1942, Truscott, now a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], was instrumental in developing an American commando unit patterned after the [[British Commandos]]. The American unit was activated by Truscott (newly promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on June 19, 1942) as the [[1st Ranger Battalion (United States)|1st Ranger Battalion]], and placed under the command of [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[William Orlando Darby]].\n\nIn May 1942, Truscott was assigned to the Allied Combined Staff under Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] and in August, he was the primary U.S. observer on the [[Dieppe Raid]]. The raid was primarily a Canadian operation, consisting of elements of the [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division]], with two British Commandos attached along with a 50-man detachment from the 1st Ranger Battalion. The Rangers were assigned to [[No. 3 Commando]], [[No. 4 Commando]], and 6 Rangers were spread out among the Canadian regiments. This was considered the first action by American troops against [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] in World War II.<ref name=hh>{{cite web| last=Houterman | first=Hans | title=US Army Officers 1939-1945 | work=WWII unit histories | url=http://www.unithistories.com/units_index/default.asp?file=../officers/officers_american.html | accessdate=4 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn July 1942, Truscott was appointed to the staff of [[IX Corps (United States)|IX Corps]] Area, at [[Fort Lewis]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref name=hh />  On November 8, 1942, now a [[two-star rank|two-star]] [[Major general (United States)|major general]], Truscott led the 9,000 men of the [[60th Infantry Regiment (United States)|60th Infantry Regiment]] (part of the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]]) and [[66th Armor Regiment (United States)|66th Armored Regiment]] (part of the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]]) in the landings at [[Mehdia]] and [[Kenitra|Port Lyautey]] in [[Morocco]], part of [[Operation Torch]] under Major General [[George S. Patton]].<ref name=Atkinson-Rick-AAatD>[[Rick Atkinson|Atkinson, Rick]]. ''[[An Army at Dawn]]''. New York: Henry Holt and Company. pp. 111, 141\u2013148. {{ISBN|0-8050-7448-1}}</ref>\n\nTruscott took command of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] in March 1943, and oversaw preparations for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], codenamed Operation Husky. He was known as a very tough trainer, bringing the 3rd Infantry Division up to a very high standard. At the age of 48, he was one of the youngest division commanders in the U.S. Army at the time. He led the division in the assault on Sicily in July 1943, coming under the command of the [[Seventh United States Army|Seventh U.S. Army]], commanded by Patton, now a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]]. Here his training paid off when the division covered great distances in the mountainous terrain at high speed. The famous 'Truscott Trot' was a marching pace of five miles per hour over the first mile, thereafter four miles per hour, much faster than the usual standard of 2.5 miles per hour. The 3rd Infantry Division was considered to be the best-trained, best-led division in the Seventh Army.\n\nAfter a brief rest to absorb replacements the division, in mid-September, nine days after the [[Allied invasion of Italy|initial Allied landings]] at Salerno, Italy, came ashore on the Italian mainland, where it [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|fought its way up the Italian peninsula]], under the command of the [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]], commanded by Major General [[John P. Lucas]]. The VI Corps was part of Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]]'s [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]]. After crossing the [[Volturno Line]] in October and fighting in severe winter weather around the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]], which saw heavy casualties sustained, the division was pulled out of the line for rest and relaxation.\n\n[[File:The commander of the Allied Armies in Italy, General Sir Harold Alexander, with American General Truscott, in charge of the Allied bridgehead at Anzio, 4 March 1944.

Alexander]], [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI), with Major General Lucian K. Truscott Jr., commander of the U.S. VI Corps, in the Anzio beachhead, Italy, 4 March 1944.]]\n\nIn January 1944, the division [[Battle of Anzio|assaulted Anzio]] as part of the U.S. VI Corps, which also included the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Infantry Division]], along with two British Commandos and three battalions of [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Rangers]], Combat Command B of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] and the [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|504th Parachute Regimental Combat Team]]. The operation, the brainchild of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], was intended to outflank, and potentially force the Germans to withdraw from their Winter Line defenses, which had considerably slowed Allied progress in Italy.\n\nLucas, the corps commander, initially decided not to push inland, as Allied commanders had intended, and Truscott's 3rd Division was soon engaged in bitter fighting and, again, suffering heavy losses as the Germans launched numerous [[counterattack]]s to drive the Allies into the sea. With Clark, the Fifth Army commander, and [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander]], [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI), growing increasingly worried about the situation, Truscott was appointed as Lucas's deputy commander and, after Lucas was dismissed on 17 February, was given command of the VI Corps. Truscott was succeeded in command of the 3rd Infantry Division by Major General [[John W. O'Daniel|John \"Iron Mike\" O'Daniel]], previously the Assistant Division Commander (ADC). At the age of 49, Truscott was the second youngest corps commander in the U.S. Army, behind only [[J. Lawton Collins]], then commanding [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] in England. Clark, writing in his memoirs after the war, claimed that he \"selected Truscott to become the new VI Corps commander because of all the division commanders available to me in the Anzio [[bridgehead]] who were familiar with the situation he was the most outstanding. A quiet, competent, and courageous officer with great battle experience through North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, he inspired confidence in all with whom he came in contact.\"<ref>General Mark W. Clark, Calculated Risk, p. 244-245</ref>\n\nFollowing Anzio, Truscott continued to command VI Corps through the fighting up the Italian boot, helping in the final [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] and the subsequent capture of Rome, just two days before the [[Normandy landings]]. However, his command was then withdrawn from the line to prepare for [[Operation Dragoon]], the amphibious assault on southern France.\n\nOn 15 August 1944, the VI Corps landed in southern France and initially faced relatively little opposition. The rapid retreat of the [[19th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Nineteenth Army]] resulted in swift gains for the Allied forces. The invasion plan was initially for US forces to conduct the initial landing, and Free French forces to conduct the breakout. This was changed to exploit the withdrawal of the German 19th Army, and US 6th Corps began a pursuit. This resulted in cutting off the escape of the enemy, and their total destruction or capture. The ''Dragoon'' force met up with southern thrusts from [[Operation Overlord]] in mid-September, near [[Dijon]].\n\n[[File:Capt. Richard Wolfer receiving Bronze Star from Gen. Truscott in France.jpg|thumb|left|Truscott pins the Bronze Star on Captain Richard Wolfer, France, 25 October 1944.]]\n\nA planned benefit of ''Dragoon'' was the usefulness of the port of [[Marseille]]. The rapid Allied advance after [[Operation Cobra]] and ''Dragoon'' slowed almost to a halt in September 1944 due to a critical lack of supplies, as thousands of tons of supplies were shunted to northwest France to compensate for the inadequacies of port facilities and land transport in northern Europe. Marseille and the southern French railways were brought back into service despite heavy damage to the port of Marseille and its railroad trunk lines. They became a significant supply route for the Allied advance into Germany, providing about a third of the Allied needs.\n\nOn 2 September 1944, Truscott was promoted to the [[three-star rank]] of lieutenant general and in October he was appointed commander of the newly formed [[Fifteenth United States Army|Fifteenth Army]], which was largely an administrative and training command.<ref>Jeffers. p. 217</ref>\n\n[[File:Co.

Truscott led the Fifth Army through the hard winter of 1944\u20131945, where many of its formations were in exposed positions in the mountains of Italy. He then led the army through the Allied [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy]] culminating in the final destruction of the German forces in Italy.\n\n===Post-war era===\nTruscott took over command of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] from [[General (United States)|General]] [[George S. Patton]] on 8 October 1945, and led it until April 1946. This command included the Eastern Military District of the U.S. occupation zone of Germany, which consisted primarily of the state of [[Bavaria]]. When the [[Seventh United States Army|Seventh Army]] was deactivated in March 1946, Truscott's Third Army took over the Western Military District (the U.S.-occupied parts of [[Baden]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[People's State of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]]).\n\n[[Will Lang Jr.]] from ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' wrote a biography on Truscott that appeared in the October 2, 1944, issue of that magazine.\n\nAfter leaving the U.S. Army, Truscott began work on his book ''Command Missions'', which was published in 1954 ({{ISBN|0-89141-364-2}}), and ''The Twilight of the U.S. Cavalry'' ({{ISBN|0-7006-0932-6}}). The latter book was published after his death by his son, Lucian III, in 1989.<ref name=\"Jeffers, p. 302\">Jeffers, p. 302.</ref> In 1954, Congress passed Public Law 83-508, which promoted several World War II senior officers who had exercised responsibilities greater than their rank; as a numbered army commander, Truscott carried out the duties of a [[four-star rank|four-star]] general, and the 1954 law promoted him to [[General (United States)|general]] on the retired list.<ref name=\"Jeffers, p. 302\"/>\n\nTruscott helped evaluate officers as a member of the War Department Screening Board. Then in 1948\u20131949, he spent a year as the Chairman of the Army Advisory Board for Amphibious Operations, at [[Fort Monroe]], Virginia. It was between meetings of this board that he began assembling the material for his two books.<ref>Jeffers, p. 283.</ref>\n\n===Central Intelligence Agency===\nIn 1951, [[Walter Bedell Smith]], Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), appointed Truscott as \"Special Consultant to the United States Commissioner\" in Frankfurt, Germany. However, this was simply a cover for his real assignment as senior Central Intelligence Agency representative in Germany. Truscott had been placed in charge of cloak-and-dagger operations in a vital part of Europe. This only came to light after declassification of a secret memorandum in 1994.<ref>Jeffers, p. 287.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, President Eisenhower approved CIA Director Allen Dulles' recommendation that General Truscott be appointed the CIA's Deputy Director for Coordination. This appointment meant that Truscott was now controlling the agency's rapidly expanding network of agents worldwide. His responsibilities included facilitating the overthrow of governments in Iran and Guatemala.<ref>Frederick W. Marks, III, and Stephen G. Rabe, \"The CIA and Castillo Armas in Guatemala, 1954: New Clues to an Old Puzzle,\" ''Diplomatic History'' (1990) 14#1 pp 67-86.</ref> Truscott was involved in planning [[Operation PBSUCCESS]], the CIA mission to overthrow Guatemalan President Jacobo \u00c1rbenz. According to Harry Jeffers' biography, Truscott was instrumental in convincing Eisenhower to support PBSUCCESS with air power.<ref>Jeffers, ch. 20</ref> However, another biography by William Heefner suggests that specifics of Truscott's involvement cannot be substantiated.<ref>Heefner, p. 339.</ref>\n\nTruscott left the CIA in 1958. He wrote nothing about his service in the CIA in ''Command Missions'', and there is nothing about his CIA activities in his papers at the George C. Marshall Library.<ref>Jeffers, pp. 292\u2013298.</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\nTruscott died on 12 September 1965, in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].<ref name=\"Arlington\">{{cite web| url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/lktruscott.htm| work=Arlington National Cemetery website| title=Lucian King Truscott Jr. | accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref> On 29 April 1966, Truscott Hall, a bachelor officers' quarters at the United States Army War College, was named after him. On 17 August 1974,<ref name=\"Arlington\"/> Sarah Truscott, his wife, died and was buried next to him at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref>Jeffers, p  308.</ref>\n\nIn 2012, he was honored at his birthplace of Chatfield.<ref>Jacobs, Janet, [http://corsicanadailysun.com/local/x594870717/Historical-marker-honoring-local-veteran-dedicated \"Historical marker honoring local veteran dedicated\"], ''[[Corsicana Daily Sun]]'', January 9, 2012</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nTruscott had a very gravelly voice, said to be the result of an accidental ingestion of acid in childhood. He was superstitious about his clothing, and usually wore a leather jacket, [[United States Army Air Forces#Service dress|\"pink\" pants]] and lucky boots in combat. He also wore a white scarf as a trademark, first during the Sicilian campaign.<ref name=\"Arlington\"/>\n\nTruscott once said to his son, \"Let me tell you something, and don't ever forget it. You play games to win, not lose. And you fight wars to win. That's spelled W-I-N!  And every good player in a game and every good commander in a war\u2026has to have some son of a bitch in him. If he doesn't, he isn't a good player or commander....It's as simple as that. No son of a bitch, no commander.\"<ref name=\"Arlington\"/>\n\nTruscott was respected by his subordinates. A medical officer in the Seventh Army related stories he'd heard from the men who served under Truscott earlier. Unlike some commanders, Truscott was not noted for self-aggrandisement,<ref name=\"Phibbs201\">Phibbs, p. 201</ref>{{Refn|group=note|\"\u2026 Truscott's absolute exclusion of his name from dispatches.

Any attempt to use Truscott's name or names of the Third Division headquarters officers in dispatches was chopped off with reproof.\"<ref name=\"Phibbs201\"/>}} nor did he suffer  such from his superiors.{{Refn|group=note|\"Bill Mauldin described Truscott as a man 'so tough he could chew up a ham like Patton without bothering to pick his teeth.'\"<ref name=\"Phibbs202\">Phibbs, p. 202</ref>}} Others noted he was humbled by the sacrifices those under him had made. [[Bill Mauldin]] described the time Truscott gave the address on Memorial Day, May 31, 1945, in the military cemetery at [[Nettuno]], outside [[Anzio]]: \"He turned his back on the assembled windbags and sparklers and talked to the crosses in the cemetery, quietly, apologizing, and then walked away without looking around.\"<ref name=\"Phibbs202\"/>{{Refn|group=note|Phibbs gives the date as 1943 and the place as Salerno but this was before the [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|landings at Salerno]] and the cemetery is located in Nettuno.}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nTruscott was portrayed by actor [[John Doucette]] in the 1970 film ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''. In one scene, as commander of the 3rd Infantry Division during the Allied invasion of Sicily, Truscott is shown arguing vehemently with Gen. Patton over the latter's orders pertaining to his Division.\n\n==Decorations and medals==\nGeneral Lucian Truscott received the U.S. Army's second-highest decoration, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], for valor in action in Sicily on July 11, 1943, the second day of the invasion.
