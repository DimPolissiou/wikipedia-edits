Lloyd Family Trust\" to provide vocational and Professional Educational Services at National and International Levels under a Christian mission and vision of preaching, teaching and Social work. It is an Autonomous Educational Institute and Vocational Training School.\n\nThe institute was a registered and accredited training institution, accredited by the [[Training Accreditation Council]] (TAC) of the [[Training Department of the Government of Western Australia]], and is listed on the \"[[Commonwealth]] Register of Institutions and Courses\" (CRICOS), which provide accredited courses to local and overseas students up to Graduate Diploma Level.\n\nWCIMT established a chain of affiliated colleges in many countries. In 2004, the trustees decided to use this infrastructure to establish the West Coast University in a favorable country; on the recommendations of  faculty members West Coast University was incorporated at [[Panama City]], under article 19 of law 32 of 1927.

They are also sometimes addressed as '''blue''' at lower levels due to the common color of the uniform worn by umpires. In professional baseball, the term ''blue'' is seldom used by players or managers, who instead call the umpire by name. Although games were often officiated by a sole umpire in the formative years of the sport, since the turn of the 20th century, officiating has been commonly divided among several umpires, who form the '''umpiring crew'''.  The position is analogous to that of a [[referee]] in many other sports.\n\n==Duties and positions==\n[[File:Umpire Malachi Moore San Antonio Texas 2016.jpg|thumb|Home plate umpire Malachi Moore reviews the [[Glossary of baseball (L)#lineup cards|lineup cards]] from both teams before a 2016 minor league baseball game]]\nIn a game officiated by two or more umpires, the '''umpire in chief''' (usually the '''home plate umpire''') is the umpire who is in charge of the entire game. This umpire calls [[strike zone|balls and strikes]], calls [[fair ball]]s, [[foul ball]]s short of first/third base, and makes most calls concerning the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] or concerning [[baserunner]]s near home plate. To avoid injury, the home plate umpire wears similar equipment to the catcher, including mask, chest protector, leg guards and shoes with extra protection added over the laces.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> If another umpire leaves the infield to cover a potential play in foul ground or in the outfield, then the plate umpire may move to cover a potential play near second or third base. (The umpire-in-chief should not be confused with the crew chief, who is often a different umpire; see below.) In the event that an umpire is injured and only three remain, the second base position will generally be left vacant.\n\nIn nearly all levels of organized baseball, including the majors, an umpiring crew rotates so that each umpire in the crew works each position, including plate umpire, an equal number of games. In the earliest days of baseball, however, many senior umpires always worked the plate, with Hall of Fame umpire [[Bill Klem]] being the last umpire to do so. Klem did so for the first 16 years of his career.<ref name=\"Chief\">{{cite news |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=591266 |title=Chief among game's umpires |date=2007-04-14 |publisher=Journal Sentinel |author=Haudricourt, Tom |accessdate=2007-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111537/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=591266 |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> On the Major League level, an umpiring crew generally rotates positions clockwise each game. For example, the plate umpire in one game would umpire third base in the next.\n\nOther umpires are called '''base umpires''' and are commonly stationed near the bases. (''Field umpire'' is a less-common term.) When two umpires are used, the second umpire is simply the '''base umpire'''. This umpire will make most calls concerning runners on the bases and nearby plays, as well as in the middle of the outfield. When three umpires are used, the second umpire is called the '''first-base umpire''' and the third umpire is called the '''third-base umpire''', even though they may move to different positions on the field as the play demands.<ref name=\"Official rules\" />  These two umpires also call [[checked swing]]s, if asked by the plate umpire (often requested by catcher or defensive manager; however, only the plate umpire can authorize an appeal to the base umpire): the first base umpire for right-handed batters, and the third base umpire for left-handed batters; to indicate a checked swing, the umpire will make a \"safe\" gesture with his arms. To indicate a full swing, he will clench his fist.\n\n[[File:MLB umpire.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A second base umpire ([[Mike Reilly (umpire)|Mike Reilly]]) at an MLB game in 2008.]]\n\nWhen four umpires are used (as is the case for all regular season MLB games unless one has to leave due to injury), each umpire is named for the base at which he is stationed. Sometimes a league will provide six umpires; the extra two are stationed along the outfield foul lines and are called the '''left-field''' and '''right-field umpires''' (or simply '''outfield umpires''').\n\nOutfield umpires are used in major events, such as the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], and depending on the level, at parts of post-season [[playoff]]s. For Major League Baseball, all playoff levels use six umpires adding a left-field and right-field umpire, while at lower levels, six umpires are used at the championship games (such as NCAA).<ref name=\"Special Event selection\">{{cite web |title=Special Event selection |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/feature.jsp?feature=event_selection |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> Rulings on catches of batted balls are usually made by the umpire closest to the play.\n\n===Crew chief===\nThe term ''umpire-in-chief'' is not to be confused with the '''crew chief''', who is usually the most experienced umpire in a crew. At the major-league and high minor-league (Class AAA and AA) levels, the crew chief acts as a liaison between the league office and the crew and has a supervisory role over other members of the crew.<ref name=\"Crews\">{{cite web |title=2007 MLB Umpire Crews |url=http://www.mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/umpires/crews.jsp |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125035536/http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/umpires/crews.jsp |archivedate=2007-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nFor example, on the Major League level, \"The Crew Chief shall coordinate and direct his crew's compliance with the Office of the Commissioner's rules and policies. Other Crew Chief responsibilities include: leading periodic discussions and reviews of situations, plays and rules with his crew; generally directing the work of the other umpires on the crew, with particular emphasis on uniformity in dealing with unique situations; assigning responsibilities for maintaining time limits during the game; ensuring the timely filing of all required crew reports for incidents such as ejections, brawls and protested games; and reporting to the Office of Commissioner any irregularity in field conditions at any ballpark.\"<ref name=\"Crews\" /> Thus, on the professional level, some of the duties assigned to the umpire-in-chief (the plate umpire) in the [[Official Baseball Rules]] have been reassigned to the crew chief, regardless of the crew chief's umpiring position during a specific game.  Instant replay reviews, for example, will be reviewed with the crew chief and one other umpire, with results announced by the crew chief.  The crew chief acts analogous to the ''crew chief'' in basketball (as referenced in the NBA and FIBA rules) or the ''referee'' in American football.\n\n===Judgment calls===\n{{seealso|Instant replay#Baseball}}\nAn umpire's judgment call used to be final, unless the umpire making the call chose to ask his partner(s) for help and then decided to reverse it after the discussion.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> Since 2014, the MLB allows managers to challenge plays during the game. If the manager successfully has a call overturned, they are rewarded with another challenge.<ref>{{cite web|title=Replay Review Regulations|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/replay_review.jsp|work=MLB|publisher=MLB|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref> If an umpire seems to make an error in rule interpretation, his call, in some leagues, can be officially protested as is the case in MLB.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> If the umpire is persistent in his or her interpretation, the matter will be settled at a later time by a league official.  An independent study of umpire pitch-call accuracy over 11 seasons (2008-2018) released on April 8, 2019 by Mark T. Williams of Boston University concluded that over 20% of certain pitches were called incorrectly. For the 2018 season, home plate umpires made about 34,000 incorrect ball and strike calls, which is about 14 per game and 1.6 per inning.<ref>{{cite web|title=MLB Umpires Missed 34,294 Ball-Strike Calls in 2018. Bring on Robo-umps?|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2019/mlb-umpires-strike-zone-accuracy/|publisher=BU Today|accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the early years of professional baseball, umpires were not engaged by the league but rather by agreement between the team captains. However, by the start of the modern era in 1901, this had become a league responsibility. There is now a unitary major league umpiring roster, although until the [[1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation|1999 labor dispute]] that led to the decertification of the [[Major League Umpires Association]], there were separate National and American League umpires. As a result of the 2000 collective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the newly formed [[Major League Baseball Umpires Association|World Umpires Association]] (now known as the Major League Baseball Umpires Association) all umpires were placed on one roster and work in games in both leagues.\n\n==Amateur umpiring==\n[[File:One Marine Making the Right Calls DVIDS177654.jpg|thumb|right|A volunteer umpire officiating a [[Little League Baseball]] game]]\nAn amateur umpire officiates non-professional or semi-professional baseball. Many amateur umpires are paid (typically on a per-game basis) and thus might be considered [[professionals]], while some amateur umpires are unpaid. According to the [[Little League Baseball]] official website, umpires should be volunteers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/umpirerole.htm|title=Umpire's Role|website=www.littleleague.org}}</ref>\n\nThere are numerous organizations that test or train anyone interested in umpiring for local leagues, and can help make connections to the leagues in the area. Little League Baseball and the [[Babe Ruth League]] are two of the most popular organizations when it comes to youth baseball, and each have their own application, test, and training process for becoming an umpire. In Canada, most umpires are certified through a provincial organization, and then hired by local municipal associations through an umpire in chief.\n\nFor the [[Little League World Series]], amateur umpires from around the world participate on a volunteer basis. Prospective Little League World Series umpires must participate at various levels of Little League All-Star tournaments, ranging from district to state to regional tournaments, prior to being accepted to work the World Series tournament.<ref name=\"LL umpires\">{{cite web |url=http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/index.asp |title=Umpires Home |publisher=[[Little League Baseball]] |accessdate=2007-05-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070425095910/http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/index.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-25}}</ref>\n\n\nOne of the more up and coming umping organization is Walks & Balks. They are based out of Minneapolis, MN and know the game like the back of their hand. If you need some serious, elite umping, consider Walks & Balks.\n\n==High school umpiring==\nIn the United States, many (if not most) high schools sponsor a baseball team.  Many high schools sponsor multiple baseball teams; for instance, \"varsity\" and \"junior varsity\" teams.  During the 2017-18 academic year there were 16,513 high schools sponsoring at least one baseball team, and 488,859 students participated on a high school baseball team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfhs.org/ParticipationStatistics/ParticipationStatistics/|title=Participation Statistics|website=www.nfhs.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Thus, high school baseball is one of the most popular levels of baseball in the United States.  Unlike college athletics, there is no competitive national championship on the high school level.  And, unlike college athletics, umpires on the high school level are not administered by a national organization (such as the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]).  Rather, high school baseball is administered at the state level (usually by a statewide high school athletic association) and the qualifications for becoming and remaining a high school umpire are usually set by the entity overseeing high school baseball in each individual state.  For example, the [[Florida High School Athletic Association]] sets forth minimum requirements for being a high school umpire in Florida.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.becomeanofficial.org/sports/ba.asp|title=Become an FHSAA Official - Baseball|website=www.becomeanofficial.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Many statewide high school athletic associations contract with multiple local umpire associations throughout their state in which the local associations agree to train and provide umpires for high school games in each association's geographic area of the state in return for a \"booking fee\" being paid to the local associations by either the statewide high school association or by individual high schools.  The local associations also promise to train their umpires to meet the state high school association's minimum requirements for umpires.  For example, in Florida the Jacksonville Umpires Association trains and provides umpires for high school games in the [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaxump.com/schools_division.html|title=About|website=www.jaxump.com|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>\n\nThe specific requirements for becoming a high school umpire vary from state-to-state.  However, generally all states share the same basic minimum requirements.  First, a person trying to become an umpire must usually register with both the state high school athletic association and their local umpire association.  Upon registering, most states provide their umpires with a high school rulebook, casebook, and umpires' manual.  Second, most states require all umpires to attend clinics and meetings.  These clinics may focus on rules, umpire mechanics, or a combination of both.  Third, most states also require an umpire to pass a rules exam.  Finally, most states also require umpires to work a certain number of pre-season scrimmages prior to working regular season games.  As an example of these requirements, Georgia has an \"officials accountability program\" which sets forth the specific requirements for its interscholastic officials (including the attendance at clinics and camps and the passing of an examination) which can be reviewed [https://www.ghsa.net/sites/default/files/documents/officials/GHSA-Officiating-Handbook_2018-2019.pdf here].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghsa.net/ghsa-contest-officials-handbook-and-accountability-program|title=GHSA Contest Officials Handbook and Accountability Program {{!}} GHSA.net|website=www.ghsa.net|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>\n\nAlthough high school baseball is administered at the state level, the various state high school athletic associations have voluntarily formed the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfhs.org/who-we-are/aboutus|title=AboutUs|website=www.nfhs.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Through the federation, most state athletic associations have agreed to use its rulebook.  Thus, while high school baseball is administered on a state level, almost all state associations use the same unique baseball rulebook (and the associated casebook and umpire manual) written specifically for the high school level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfhs.com/p-1102-2019-baseball-rules-book.aspx?CategoryID=0&SectionID=0&ManufacturerID=0&DistributorID=0&GenreID=0&VectorID=0&|title=National Federation of State High School Associations - 2019 Baseball Rules Book|website=www.nfhs.com|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> As a result, if an individual umpire moves from one state to another state (s)he would likely be using the same rule set in his/her new state as was used in his/her former state.

As they are not salaried, they are not paid if they do not actually umpire a game.  The amount paid differs, often significantly, from state to state.  Most high school games are officiated by a two-umpire crew.<ref>[http://www.westernpiedmontbaseball.org/RULES%20&%20MECHANICS.htm], retrieved November 1, 2013</ref>   However, many states use three-umpire and four-umpire crews to officiate playoff games.\n\n==Professional umpire training and career development==\nBecoming a [[Major League Baseball]] umpire requires rigorous training, and very few succeed. Provided the individual makes satisfactory progress throughout, it typically takes from 7\u201310 years to achieve MLB status. First, a person desiring to become a professional umpire must attend one of two umpiring schools authorized by Major League Baseball: [[Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy]] or The [[Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School]].<ref name=\"MiLB umpires\">{{cite web |url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp?mc=_ump_schools |title=Where are the Professional Umpire Schools Located? |publisher=[[Minor League Baseball|MiLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>   The former is owned and operated by [[National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues|Minor League Baseball]] while the latter is run by former and current Major League and Minor League umpires.  Both are located in [[Florida]]. There are no prerequisites for attending these schools; however, there is an [http://www.mlbuc.com Umpire Camp], run by Major League Baseball, that is generally considered a \"tool for success\" at either of these schools. These camps, offered as two separate one-week sessions, are held in November in Southern California. Top students at these camps are eligible to earn scholarships to either of the professional umpire schools in Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/camp/index.jsp?content=faqs|title=MLB Umpire Camps|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nAfter five weeks of training, each school sends its top students to the Minor League Baseball Umpire Development (MiLBUD) evaluation course also held in Florida.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\">{{cite web|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp?mc=_ump_career|title=Become an Umpire - MiLB.com Official Info - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}</ref> Minor League Baseball Umpire Development, \"is the entity which is responsible for the training, evaluation, and recommendation for promotion, retention, or release of all umpires in the Minor League Baseball system throughout the United States and Canada.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.milb.com/about/umpires|title=Minor League Baseball umpires|website=MiLB.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>  The actual number of students sent on to the evaluation course is determined by MiLBUD using input from the umpire schools.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/> Generally, the top 10 to 20 percent of each school's graduating class will advance to the evaluation course. The evaluation course is conducted by MiLBUD staff, some of whom are also instructors at the Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/> The evaluation course generally lasts around 10 days. Depending on the number of available positions in the various minor leagues, some (but not all) of the evaluation course attendees will be assigned to a low level [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]]. Out of approximately 300 original umpire school students, about 30-35 will ultimately be offered jobs in Minor League Baseball after the evaluation course.\n\nProfessional umpires begin their careers in one of the Rookie or [[Class A (baseball)|Class \"A\"]] Short-Season leagues, with Class-A being divided into three levels (Short-Season, Long-Season and Advanced \"A\").<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/>  Top umpiring prospects will often begin their careers in a short-season \"A\" league (for example, the [[New York\u2013Penn League]]), but most will begin in a rookie league (for example, the [[Gulf Coast League]]).  Since 2008, some umpires who attend the evaluation course, but are not offered jobs in professional baseball may be offered jobs in the [[Coastal Plain League]] (a summer wood bat league for collegiate players).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coastalplain.com/about/Umpires|title=Coastal Plain League|website=Coastal Plain League|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>  During the season, umpires in the Coastal Plain League are evaluated by MiLBUD and they may earn a promotion to a Rookie professional league as a result of injuries or resignations by umpires at higher levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coastalplain.com/about/Umpires|title=Coastal Plain League|website=Coastal Plain League|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:David Rackley 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Umpire [[David Rackley]] working a [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Texas League]] game in 2006]]\nThroughout the season, all minor league umpires in Rookie leagues, Class-A, and Class-AA are evaluated by members of the MiLBUD staff.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\">{{cite web|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp|title=Umpires - MiLB.com Official Info - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}</ref>  All umpires receive a detailed written evaluation of their performance after every season.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\"/>  In addition, all umpires (except those in the rookie or Short Season Class-A leagues) receive written mid-season evaluations.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\"/>\n\nGenerally, an umpire is regarded as making adequate progress \"up the ranks\" if he advances up one level of Class \"A\" ball each year (thus earning promotion to Class AA after three to four years) and promotion to Class AAA after two to three years on the Class AA level. However, this is a very rough estimate and other factors not discussed (such as the number of retirements at higher levels) may dramatically affect these estimates. For example, many umpires saw rapid advancement in 1999 due to the mass resignation of many Major League umpires as a [[collective bargaining]] ploy.\n\nWhen promoted to the Class AAA level, an umpire's evaluation will also be conducted by the umpiring supervisory staff of Major League Baseball. In recent years, top AAA prospects, in addition to umpiring and being evaluated during the regular season (in either the [[International League|International]] or [[Pacific Coast League]]), have been required to umpire in the [[Arizona Fall League]] where they receive extensive training and evaluation by Major League Baseball staff.  Additionally, top minor league prospects will also be sent to umpire in winter leagues (during Major League and Minor League baseball's off-season) usually located in the Caribbean, Central America or South America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.closecallsports.com/2016/11/2016-17-winter-league-milb-umpires.html|title=2016-17 Winter League MiLB Umpire Rosters|last=Imber|first=Gil|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, top AAA prospects may also be rewarded with umpiring only Major League preseason games during [[spring training]] (in lieu of Class AAA games). Additionally, the very top prospects may umpire Major League regular season games on a limited basis as \"fill-in\" umpires (where the Class AAA umpire replaces a sick, injured or vacationing Major League umpire).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.closecallsports.com/2019/01/triple-call-up-and-fill-in-results-end.html|title=Triple-A Call-Up and Fill-In Results - 2018-19 Offseason|last=Imber|first=Gil|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\nFinally, upon the retirement (or firing) of a Major League umpire, a top Class AAA umpire will be promoted to Major League Baseball's permanent umpire staff. During this entire process, if an umpire is evaluated as no longer being a major-league prospect, he will be released, ending his professional career. In all, MiLBUD estimates that it will take an umpire seven to eight years of professional umpiring before he will be considered for a major league position.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/>\n\n{{As of|2018}}, major league umpires earn $150,000 to $450,000 per year depending on their experience, with a $340 [[per diem]] for hotel and meals.<ref name=brpaid>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2773321-how-much-are-mlb-umpires-paid |title=How Much Are MLB Umpires Paid? |first=Kerry |last=Miller |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=May 3, 2018 |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref> Minor league umpires earn from $2,000 to $3,900 per month during the season.<ref name=brpaid/> Amounts vary based on the umpire's classification and experience.\n\n{{As of|2018|3}}, there are 19 four-man crews in MLB, for a total of 76 full-time umpires; they are augmented by 16 Class AAA umpires eligible to umpire regular season games, yielding a total roster of 92 MLB umpires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/roster.jsp |title=Major League Umpire Roster |date=March 2018 |website=[[MLB.com]] |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tom Connolly 1916.jpg|thumb|right|Umpire [[Tom Connolly]] shown with the outside chest protector worn by AL home plate umpires for much of the 20th century]]\n\n==Uniform==\nUmpires are often referred as \"Blue\" because of the color of their uniforms. In the early days of baseball, umpire uniforms resembled suits (usually to keep them inconspicuous when in public) with the only difference being National League umpires wore an inside chest protector while American League umpires wore an outside (or \"balloon\") protector when calling balls and strikes.\n\nIn the 1960s, umpires were allowed to wear dress shirts that were light blue, and the American League umpires wore grey slacks with their blue coats, while National League umpires wore all blue coats and slacks. In 1970, the National League added a large patch on their coat and uniform with the league logo and a number on their left sleeve, along with a short-sleeved light blue shirt for hot summer games. The American League followed suit with the short sleeves in 1972, then in 1973 they wore a maroon blazer along with blue pants until 1979. In 1975, the American League umpire hats included the abbreviation \"AL\" (previous to that they included a shield for the AL). To celebrate the National League's 100th anniversary in 1976, the umpire blazers/light blue shirts included the league's centennial patch and the hats were designed in the \"pillbox\" style  with the year \"'76\" included on them. In 1977, the use of the outside (balloon) protector was outlawed for new umpires but grandfathered for existing umpires, with the last umpire that used the outside protector, [[Jerry Neudecker]], retiring in 1985. The use of ties with the blazers were gradually phased out; the last time they were worn in the World Series was in [[1975 World Series|1975]] and overall was in the [[1979 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] by [[George Maloney]], [[Terry Cooney]], and [[Nick Bremigan]]. In World Series games starting in [[1976 World Series|1976]], the umpires wore sweaters (light blue for National League umpires and off-white for American League umpires) instead of ties.\n\nIn 1980, Major League Baseball mandated that the umpires' uniforms be standardized, and they went to the American League pre-1973 style of blue blazers, grey slacks, and short sleeved light blue shirts; the American League began adding numbers to their umpire uniforms, with \"AL\" on their caps and National League umpires had \"NL\" on their caps. This style was pretty much the same (except for the use of windbreakers and sweaters later in the 1980s) through 1995. The league initials on the caps changed towards the late 1980s when the \"N\" and \"L\" were combined into a single letter, while the \"A\" and the \"L\" were interlocked.\n\nIn 1996, the button-down light blue shirt was replaced with a navy blue polo shirt with red and white trim on the collar and sleeve cuffs. The numbers were changed to red on the shirts, an \"N\" with the National League logo and an \"A\" with the American League logo on the hats. The American League used an optional red short-sleeved shirt (possibly a homage to the 1973-79 red blazers) that wasn't used by many umpires (the notable exceptions were [[Derryl Cousins]] and [[Dale Scott]], who frequently wore the red shirts while working home plate, even as their colleagues on the bases wore navy blue shirts). The National League added a light blue shirt in 1997, which became much more popular than the red shirts in the AL.\n\nBeginning in 2000, after the individual leagues' umpires were consolidated into a single staff, the 1996-99 uniform styles were carried over with \"MLB\" on the caps instead of the league designations. Since 2001, the uniforms switched to black blazers/windbreakers with grey slacks, with the hats now including the MLB logo (along with the short-sleeved light blue shirts), which remain relatively unchanged. The navy blue shirt was phased out in favor of black, and the light blue shirt was reintroduced after a brief experiment with gray. For the 2017 season, the umpires' jacket was black with light blue trim over the shoulders.\n\n==Famous umpires==\n{{see also|Honor Rolls of Baseball #Umpires|Baseball awards #Other individual awards}}\n\n[[File:Billklem.jpg|thumb|right|Longtime umpire [[Bill Klem]], a member of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]]]]\n\n===Hall of Fame===\nThe following ten umpires have been inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/umpires/umpiresinhof.shtml |title=Hall of Fame Umpires |website=[[Baseball Almanac]] |accessdate=August 21, 2017}}</ref>\n*Class of 1953 \u2013 [[Tom Connolly|Tommy Connolly]] (NL, 1898\u20131900; AL, 1901\u20131931) \n*Class of 1953 \u2013 [[Bill Klem]] ([[National League|NL]] 1905\u20131941)\n*Class of 1973 \u2013 [[Billy Evans]] ([[American League|AL]], 1906\u20131927) \n*Class of 1974 \u2013 [[Jocko Conlan]] ([[National League|NL]] 1941\u20131964) \n*Class of 1976 \u2013 [[Cal Hubbard]] ([[American League|AL]], 1936\u20131951) \n*Class of 1989 \u2013 [[Al Barlick]] ([[National League|NL]], 1940\u20131943, 1946\u20131955, 1958\u20131971) \n*Class of 1992 \u2013 [[Bill McGowan]] ([[American League|AL]], 1925\u20131954)\n*Class of 1999 \u2013 [[Nestor Chylak]] ([[American League|AL]], 1954\u20131978)  \n*Class of 2010 \u2013 [[Doug Harvey (umpire)|Doug Harvey]] ([[National League|NL]] 1962\u20131992) \n*Class of 2013 \u2013 [[Hank O'Day]] ([[National League|NL]], 1895, 1897\u20131911, 1913, 1915\u20131927)\n\nConlan and O'Day played in 128 and 232 major league games, respectively, prior to becoming professional umpires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/C/Pconlj102.htm|title=Jocko Conlan|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/O/Podayh101.htm|title=Hank O'Day|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref>\n\nSeveral ''player'' inductees to the Hall of Fame served as substitute umpires for a small number of games during the early years of baseball; these include [[Hughie Jennings]], [[Willie Keeler]], [[King Kelly]], and [[Chuck Klein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/index.html#Umpires|title=The Directory of Umpires|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref>  Additionally, Hall of Fame player inductees [[Tim Keefe]] and [[Ed Walsh]] umpired professionally in the major leagues after their playing careers ended.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Keefe|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/K/Pkeeft101.htm|work=Retrosheet.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ed Walsh|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/W/Pwalse101.htm|work=Retrosheet.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Numbers retired by the National and American Leagues===\n{{see also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}\nLike players, umpires are identified by numbers on their uniforms. National League umpires began wearing numbers in 1970 (though they were assigned numbers in the 1960s) and American League umpires were assigned and began wearing uniform numbers in 1980. The National League umpires' numbers were initially assigned in alphabetical order ([[Al Barlick]] wearing number 1, [[Ken Burkhart]] number 2, etc.) from 1970 to 1978, which meant that an umpire's number could change each year depending on retirements and other staff changes. In 1979, the National League changed the numbering system and thereafter a number's umpire did not change from year to year. At first, as new umpires, they would be assigned higher numbers (for example, in 1979, [[Dave Pallone]], [[Steve Fields]], [[Fred Brocklander]], and [[Lanny Harris]] were assigned numbers 26 to 29 instead of available numbers between 1 and 25). The National League numbering practice changed again in the mid-1980s, when new umpires were assigned previously used numbers (for example, in 1982 [[Gerry Davis (umpire)|Gerry Davis]] was assigned number 12, previously worn by [[Andy Olsen]], and in 1985 [[Tom Hallion]] was assigned number 20, previously worn by [[Ed Vargo]].)\n\nThe American League's number assignments were largely random. [[Bill Haller]], the senior American League umpire in 1980, wore number 1 until his retirement following the [[1982 World Series]], but the number was never reassigned.\n\nIn 2000, the American League and National League umpiring staffs were merged into a unified staff under the auspices of Major League Baseball, and all numbers were made available, including the numbers that had been retired by one of the leagues. (For example, the American League had retired [[Lou DiMuro]]'s number 16 after his death, but it was made available to his son [[Mike DiMuro|Mike]] after the staffs were unified.) In the event of duplications, the more senior umpire was given the first choice. (For example, [[Al Clark (umpire)|Al Clark]] in the AL and [[Jerry Layne]] in the NL both wore the number 24, but because Clark had more seniority he was assigned 24 and Layne number 26. When Clark was relieved of his duties in 2000, Layne was able to obtain number 24.)\n\nFrom time to time, Major League Baseball retires those numbers for umpires who have given outstanding service to the game, or in honor of umpires who have died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/feature.jsp?feature=retired_numbers/|title=Umpires: Feature|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nSince unified umpiring crews were established in 2000, all numbers are available to Major League Baseball umpires, as each retired number was reserved per league. Only one umpire number has been retired since the current format was established, 42, because of the [[Major League Baseball]] policy instituted in 1997.\n\n* #1 [[Bill Klem]] ([[National League|NL]], 1905\u201341); currently worn by [[Bruce Dreckman]]\n* #2 [[Nick Bremigan]] ([[American League|AL]], 1974\u201389); currently worn by [[Dan Bellino]]\n* #2 [[Jocko Conlan]] ([[National League|NL]], 1941\u201364); worn by [[Jerry Crawford]] during his tenure in the NL (1977\u20131999)\n* #3 [[Al Barlick]] ([[National League|NL]], 1940\u201343, 1946\u201355, 1958\u201371); currently worn by [[Bill Welke]]\n* #9 [[Bill Kunkel (baseball)|Bill Kunkel]] ([[American League|AL]], 1968\u201384); also a National Basketball Association referee.

The leading '''n''' became attached to the article, changing it to '''an Oumper''' around 1475; this sort of linguistic shift is called [[false splitting]]. Thus today one says \"an umpire\" instead of \"a numpire\".\n\nThe word was applied to the officials of many sports other than baseball, including [[association football]] (where it has been superseded by ''referee'') and [[Umpire (cricket)|cricket]] (which still uses it).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n*[[List of Major League Baseball umpires]]\n*[[Referee]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=Three and Two!

They are also sometimes addressed as '''blue''' at lower levels due to the common color of the uniform worn by umpires. In professional baseball, the term ''blue'' is seldom used by players or managers, who instead call the umpire by name. Although games were often officiated by a sole umpire in the formative years of the sport, since the turn of the 20th century, officiating has been commonly divided among several umpires, who form the '''umpiring crew'''.  The position is analogous to that of a [[referee]] in many other sports.\n\n==Duties and positions==\n[[File:Umpire Malachi Moore San Antonio Texas 2016.jpg|thumb|Home plate umpire Malachi Moore reviews the [[Glossary of baseball (L)#lineup cards|lineup cards]] from both teams before a 2016 minor league baseball game]]\nIn a game officiated by two or more umpires, the '''umpire in chief''' (usually the '''home plate umpire''') is the umpire who is in charge of the entire game. This umpire calls [[strike zone|balls and strikes]], calls [[fair ball]]s, [[foul ball]]s short of first/third base, and makes most calls concerning the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] or concerning [[baserunner]]s near home plate. To avoid injury, the home plate umpire wears similar equipment to the catcher, including mask, chest protector, leg guards and shoes with extra protection added over the laces.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> If another umpire leaves the infield to cover a potential play in foul ground or in the outfield, then the plate umpire may move to cover a potential play near second or third base. (The umpire-in-chief should not be confused with the crew chief, who is often a different umpire; see below.) In the event that an umpire is injured and only three remain, the second base position will generally be left vacant.\n\nIn nearly all levels of organized baseball, including the majors, an umpiring crew rotates so that each umpire in the crew works each position, including plate umpire, an equal number of games. In the earliest days of baseball, however, many senior umpires always worked the plate, with Hall of Fame umpire [[Bill Klem]] being the last umpire to do so. Klem did so for the first 16 years of his career.<ref name=\"Chief\">{{cite news |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=591266 |title=Chief among game's umpires |date=2007-04-14 |publisher=Journal Sentinel |author=Haudricourt, Tom |accessdate=2007-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111537/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=591266 |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> On the Major League level, an umpiring crew generally rotates positions clockwise each game. For example, the plate umpire in one game would umpire third base in the next.\n\nOther umpires are called '''base umpires''' and are commonly stationed near the bases. (''Field umpire'' is a less-common term.) When two umpires are used, the second umpire is simply the '''base umpire'''. This umpire will make most calls concerning runners on the bases and nearby plays, as well as in the middle of the outfield. When three umpires are used, the second umpire is called the '''first-base umpire''' and the third umpire is called the '''third-base umpire''', even though they may move to different positions on the field as the play demands.<ref name=\"Official rules\" />  These two umpires also call [[checked swing]]s, if asked by the plate umpire (often requested by catcher or defensive manager; however, only the plate umpire can authorize an appeal to the base umpire): the first base umpire for right-handed batters, and the third base umpire for left-handed batters; to indicate a checked swing, the umpire will make a \"safe\" gesture with his arms. To indicate a full swing, he will clench his fist.\n\n[[File:MLB umpire.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A second base umpire ([[Mike Reilly (umpire)|Mike Reilly]]) at an MLB game in 2008.]]\n\nWhen four umpires are used (as is the case for all regular season MLB games unless one has to leave due to injury), each umpire is named for the base at which he is stationed. Sometimes a league will provide six umpires; the extra two are stationed along the outfield foul lines and are called the '''left-field''' and '''right-field umpires''' (or simply '''outfield umpires''').\n\nOutfield umpires are used in major events, such as the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], and depending on the level, at parts of post-season [[playoff]]s. For Major League Baseball, all playoff levels use six umpires adding a left-field and right-field umpire, while at lower levels, six umpires are used at the championship games (such as NCAA).<ref name=\"Special Event selection\">{{cite web |title=Special Event selection |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/feature.jsp?feature=event_selection |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> Rulings on catches of batted balls are usually made by the umpire closest to the play.\n\n===Crew chief===\nThe term ''umpire-in-chief'' is not to be confused with the '''crew chief''', who is usually the most experienced umpire in a crew. At the major-league and high minor-league (Class AAA and AA) levels, the crew chief acts as a liaison between the league office and the crew and has a supervisory role over other members of the crew.<ref name=\"Crews\">{{cite web |title=2007 MLB Umpire Crews |url=http://www.mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/umpires/crews.jsp |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125035536/http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/umpires/crews.jsp |archivedate=2007-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nFor example, on the Major League level, \"The Crew Chief shall coordinate and direct his crew's compliance with the Office of the Commissioner's rules and policies. Other Crew Chief responsibilities include: leading periodic discussions and reviews of situations, plays and rules with his crew; generally directing the work of the other umpires on the crew, with particular emphasis on uniformity in dealing with unique situations; assigning responsibilities for maintaining time limits during the game; ensuring the timely filing of all required crew reports for incidents such as ejections, brawls and protested games; and reporting to the Office of Commissioner any irregularity in field conditions at any ballpark.\"<ref name=\"Crews\" /> Thus, on the professional level, some of the duties assigned to the umpire-in-chief (the plate umpire) in the [[Official Baseball Rules]] have been reassigned to the crew chief, regardless of the crew chief's umpiring position during a specific game.  Instant replay reviews, for example, will be reviewed with the crew chief and one other umpire, with results announced by the crew chief.  The crew chief acts analogous to the ''crew chief'' in basketball (as referenced in the NBA and FIBA rules) or the ''referee'' in American football.\n\n===Judgment calls===\n{{seealso|Instant replay#Baseball}}\nAn umpire's judgment call used to be final, unless the umpire making the call chose to ask his partner(s) for help and then decided to reverse it after the discussion.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> Since 2014, the MLB allows managers to challenge plays during the game. If the manager successfully has a call overturned, they are rewarded with another challenge.<ref>{{cite web|title=Replay Review Regulations|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/replay_review.jsp|work=MLB|publisher=MLB|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref> If an umpire seems to make an error in rule interpretation, his call, in some leagues, can be officially protested as is the case in MLB.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> If the umpire is persistent in his or her interpretation, the matter will be settled at a later time by a league official.  An independent study of umpire pitch-call accuracy over 11 seasons (2008-2018) released on April 8, 2019 by Mark T. Williams of Boston University concluded that over 20% of certain pitches were called incorrectly. For the 2018 season, home plate umpires made about 34,000 incorrect ball and strike calls, which is about 14 per game and 1.6 per inning.<ref>{{cite web|title=MLB Umpires Missed 34,294 Ball-Strike Calls in 2018.

However, by the start of the modern era in 1901, this had become a league responsibility. There is now a unitary major league umpiring roster, although until the [[1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation|1999 labor dispute]] that led to the decertification of the [[Major League Umpires Association]], there were separate National and American League umpires. As a result of the 2000 collective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the newly formed [[Major League Baseball Umpires Association|World Umpires Association]] (now known as the Major League Baseball Umpires Association) all umpires were placed on one roster and work in games in both leagues.\n\n==Amateur umpiring==\n[[File:One Marine Making the Right Calls DVIDS177654.jpg|thumb|right|A volunteer umpire officiating a [[Little League Baseball]] game]]\nAn amateur umpire officiates non-professional or semi-professional baseball. Many amateur umpires are paid (typically on a per-game basis) and thus might be considered [[professionals]], while some amateur umpires are unpaid. According to the [[Little League Baseball]] official website, umpires should be volunteers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/umpirerole.htm|title=Umpire's Role|website=www.littleleague.org}}</ref>\n\nThere are numerous organizations that test or train anyone interested in umpiring for local leagues, and can help make connections to the leagues in the area. Little League Baseball and the [[Babe Ruth League]] are two of the most popular organizations when it comes to youth baseball, and each have their own application, test, and training process for becoming an umpire. In Canada, most umpires are certified through a provincial organization, and then hired by local municipal associations through an umpire in chief.\n\nFor the [[Little League World Series]], amateur umpires from around the world participate on a volunteer basis. Prospective Little League World Series umpires must participate at various levels of Little League All-Star tournaments, ranging from district to state to regional tournaments, prior to being accepted to work the World Series tournament.<ref name=\"LL umpires\">{{cite web |url=http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/index.asp |title=Umpires Home |publisher=[[Little League Baseball]] |accessdate=2007-05-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070425095910/http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/index.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-25}}</ref>\n\n==High school umpiring==\nIn the United States, many (if not most) high schools sponsor a baseball team.  Many high schools sponsor multiple baseball teams; for instance, \"varsity\" and \"junior varsity\" teams.  During the 2017-18 academic year there were 16,513 high schools sponsoring at least one baseball team, and 488,859 students participated on a high school baseball team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfhs.org/ParticipationStatistics/ParticipationStatistics/|title=Participation Statistics|website=www.nfhs.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Thus, high school baseball is one of the most popular levels of baseball in the United States.  Unlike college athletics, there is no competitive national championship on the high school level.  And, unlike college athletics, umpires on the high school level are not administered by a national organization (such as the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]).  Rather, high school baseball is administered at the state level (usually by a statewide high school athletic association) and the qualifications for becoming and remaining a high school umpire are usually set by the entity overseeing high school baseball in each individual state.  For example, the [[Florida High School Athletic Association]] sets forth minimum requirements for being a high school umpire in Florida.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.becomeanofficial.org/sports/ba.asp|title=Become an FHSAA Official - Baseball|website=www.becomeanofficial.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Many statewide high school athletic associations contract with multiple local umpire associations throughout their state in which the local associations agree to train and provide umpires for high school games in each association's geographic area of the state in return for a \"booking fee\" being paid to the local associations by either the statewide high school association or by individual high schools.  The local associations also promise to train their umpires to meet the state high school association's minimum requirements for umpires.  For example, in Florida the Jacksonville Umpires Association trains and provides umpires for high school games in the [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaxump.com/schools_division.html|title=About|website=www.jaxump.com|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>\n\nThe specific requirements for becoming a high school umpire vary from state-to-state.  However, generally all states share the same basic minimum requirements.  First, a person trying to become an umpire must usually register with both the state high school athletic association and their local umpire association.  Upon registering, most states provide their umpires with a high school rulebook, casebook, and umpires' manual.  Second, most states require all umpires to attend clinics and meetings.  These clinics may focus on rules, umpire mechanics, or a combination of both.  Third, most states also require an umpire to pass a rules exam.  Finally, most states also require umpires to work a certain number of pre-season scrimmages prior to working regular season games.  As an example of these requirements, Georgia has an \"officials accountability program\" which sets forth the specific requirements for its interscholastic officials (including the attendance at clinics and camps and the passing of an examination) which can be reviewed [https://www.ghsa.net/sites/default/files/documents/officials/GHSA-Officiating-Handbook_2018-2019.pdf here].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghsa.net/ghsa-contest-officials-handbook-and-accountability-program|title=GHSA Contest Officials Handbook and Accountability Program {{!}} GHSA.net|website=www.ghsa.net|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>\n\nAlthough high school baseball is administered at the state level, the various state high school athletic associations have voluntarily formed the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfhs.org/who-we-are/aboutus|title=AboutUs|website=www.nfhs.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Through the federation, most state athletic associations have agreed to use its rulebook.  Thus, while high school baseball is administered on a state level, almost all state associations use the same unique baseball rulebook (and the associated casebook and umpire manual) written specifically for the high school level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfhs.com/p-1102-2019-baseball-rules-book.aspx?CategoryID=0&SectionID=0&ManufacturerID=0&DistributorID=0&GenreID=0&VectorID=0&|title=National Federation of State High School Associations - 2019 Baseball Rules Book|website=www.nfhs.com|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> As a result, if an individual umpire moves from one state to another state (s)he would likely be using the same rule set in his/her new state as was used in his/her former state.  However, that there are significant rule differences between the federation's rulebook compared to [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) and [[College baseball|NCAA]] rules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umpirebible.com/index.php/home/obr-fed-rule-differences|title=OBR-FED rule differences - UmpireBible|website=www.umpirebible.com|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> Thus, individuals wanting to umpire on the high school level will have to learn a different set of rules than those they may be familiar with had they previously umpired in a youth league using the MLB or NCAA rulebooks.\n\nAlmost exclusively, high school umpires are paid on a per game basis.  As they are not salaried, they are not paid if they do not actually umpire a game.  The amount paid differs, often significantly, from state to state.  Most high school games are officiated by a two-umpire crew.<ref>[http://www.westernpiedmontbaseball.org/RULES%20&%20MECHANICS.htm], retrieved November 1, 2013</ref>   However, many states use three-umpire and four-umpire crews to officiate playoff games.\n\n==Professional umpire training and career development==\nBecoming a [[Major League Baseball]] umpire requires rigorous training, and very few succeed. Provided the individual makes satisfactory progress throughout, it typically takes from 7\u201310 years to achieve MLB status. First, a person desiring to become a professional umpire must attend one of two umpiring schools authorized by Major League Baseball: [[Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy]] or The [[Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School]].<ref name=\"MiLB umpires\">{{cite web |url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp?mc=_ump_schools |title=Where are the Professional Umpire Schools Located? |publisher=[[Minor League Baseball|MiLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>   The former is owned and operated by [[National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues|Minor League Baseball]] while the latter is run by former and current Major League and Minor League umpires.  Both are located in [[Florida]]. There are no prerequisites for attending these schools; however, there is an [http://www.mlbuc.com Umpire Camp], run by Major League Baseball, that is generally considered a \"tool for success\" at either of these schools. These camps, offered as two separate one-week sessions, are held in November in Southern California. Top students at these camps are eligible to earn scholarships to either of the professional umpire schools in Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/camp/index.jsp?content=faqs|title=MLB Umpire Camps|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nAfter five weeks of training, each school sends its top students to the Minor League Baseball Umpire Development (MiLBUD) evaluation course also held in Florida.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\">{{cite web|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp?mc=_ump_career|title=Become an Umpire - MiLB.com Official Info - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}</ref> Minor League Baseball Umpire Development, \"is the entity which is responsible for the training, evaluation, and recommendation for promotion, retention, or release of all umpires in the Minor League Baseball system throughout the United States and Canada.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.milb.com/about/umpires|title=Minor League Baseball umpires|website=MiLB.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>  The actual number of students sent on to the evaluation course is determined by MiLBUD using input from the umpire schools.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/> Generally, the top 10 to 20 percent of each school's graduating class will advance to the evaluation course. The evaluation course is conducted by MiLBUD staff, some of whom are also instructors at the Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/> The evaluation course generally lasts around 10 days. Depending on the number of available positions in the various minor leagues, some (but not all) of the evaluation course attendees will be assigned to a low level [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]]. Out of approximately 300 original umpire school students, about 30-35 will ultimately be offered jobs in Minor League Baseball after the evaluation course.\n\nProfessional umpires begin their careers in one of the Rookie or [[Class A (baseball)|Class \"A\"]] Short-Season leagues, with Class-A being divided into three levels (Short-Season, Long-Season and Advanced \"A\").<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/>  Top umpiring prospects will often begin their careers in a short-season \"A\" league (for example, the [[New York\u2013Penn League]]), but most will begin in a rookie league (for example, the [[Gulf Coast League]]).  Since 2008, some umpires who attend the evaluation course, but are not offered jobs in professional baseball may be offered jobs in the [[Coastal Plain League]] (a summer wood bat league for collegiate players).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coastalplain.com/about/Umpires|title=Coastal Plain League|website=Coastal Plain League|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>  During the season, umpires in the Coastal Plain League are evaluated by MiLBUD and they may earn a promotion to a Rookie professional league as a result of injuries or resignations by umpires at higher levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coastalplain.com/about/Umpires|title=Coastal Plain League|website=Coastal Plain League|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:David Rackley 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Umpire [[David Rackley]] working a [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Texas League]] game in 2006]]\nThroughout the season, all minor league umpires in Rookie leagues, Class-A, and Class-AA are evaluated by members of the MiLBUD staff.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\">{{cite web|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp|title=Umpires - MiLB.com Official Info - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}</ref>  All umpires receive a detailed written evaluation of their performance after every season.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\"/>  In addition, all umpires (except those in the rookie or Short Season Class-A leagues) receive written mid-season evaluations.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\"/>\n\nGenerally, an umpire is regarded as making adequate progress \"up the ranks\" if he advances up one level of Class \"A\" ball each year (thus earning promotion to Class AA after three to four years) and promotion to Class AAA after two to three years on the Class AA level. However, this is a very rough estimate and other factors not discussed (such as the number of retirements at higher levels) may dramatically affect these estimates. For example, many umpires saw rapid advancement in 1999 due to the mass resignation of many Major League umpires as a [[collective bargaining]] ploy.\n\nWhen promoted to the Class AAA level, an umpire's evaluation will also be conducted by the umpiring supervisory staff of Major League Baseball. In recent years, top AAA prospects, in addition to umpiring and being evaluated during the regular season (in either the [[International League|International]] or [[Pacific Coast League]]), have been required to umpire in the [[Arizona Fall League]] where they receive extensive training and evaluation by Major League Baseball staff.  Additionally, top minor league prospects will also be sent to umpire in winter leagues (during Major League and Minor League baseball's off-season) usually located in the Caribbean, Central America or South America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.closecallsports.com/2016/11/2016-17-winter-league-milb-umpires.html|title=2016-17 Winter League MiLB Umpire Rosters|last=Imber|first=Gil|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, top AAA prospects may also be rewarded with umpiring only Major League preseason games during [[spring training]] (in lieu of Class AAA games). Additionally, the very top prospects may umpire Major League regular season games on a limited basis as \"fill-in\" umpires (where the Class AAA umpire replaces a sick, injured or vacationing Major League umpire).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.closecallsports.com/2019/01/triple-call-up-and-fill-in-results-end.html|title=Triple-A Call-Up and Fill-In Results - 2018-19 Offseason|last=Imber|first=Gil|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\nFinally, upon the retirement (or firing) of a Major League umpire, a top Class AAA umpire will be promoted to Major League Baseball's permanent umpire staff. During this entire process, if an umpire is evaluated as no longer being a major-league prospect, he will be released, ending his professional career. In all, MiLBUD estimates that it will take an umpire seven to eight years of professional umpiring before he will be considered for a major league position.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/>\n\n{{As of|2018}}, major league umpires earn $150,000 to $450,000 per year depending on their experience, with a $340 [[per diem]] for hotel and meals.<ref name=brpaid>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2773321-how-much-are-mlb-umpires-paid |title=How Much Are MLB Umpires Paid? |first=Kerry |last=Miller |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=May 3, 2018 |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref> Minor league umpires earn from $2,000 to $3,900 per month during the season.<ref name=brpaid/> Amounts vary based on the umpire's classification and experience.\n\n{{As of|2018|3}}, there are 19 four-man crews in MLB, for a total of 76 full-time umpires; they are augmented by 16 Class AAA umpires eligible to umpire regular season games, yielding a total roster of 92 MLB umpires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/roster.jsp |title=Major League Umpire Roster |date=March 2018 |website=[[MLB.com]] |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tom Connolly 1916.jpg|thumb|right|Umpire [[Tom Connolly]] shown with the outside chest protector worn by AL home plate umpires for much of the 20th century]]\n\n==Uniform==\nUmpires are often referred as \"Blue\" because of the color of their uniforms. In the early days of baseball, umpire uniforms resembled suits (usually to keep them inconspicuous when in public) with the only difference being National League umpires wore an inside chest protector while American League umpires wore an outside (or \"balloon\") protector when calling balls and strikes.\n\nIn the 1960s, umpires were allowed to wear dress shirts that were light blue, and the American League umpires wore grey slacks with their blue coats, while National League umpires wore all blue coats and slacks. In 1970, the National League added a large patch on their coat and uniform with the league logo and a number on their left sleeve, along with a short-sleeved light blue shirt for hot summer games. The American League followed suit with the short sleeves in 1972, then in 1973 they wore a maroon blazer along with blue pants until 1979. In 1975, the American League umpire hats included the abbreviation \"AL\" (previous to that they included a shield for the AL). To celebrate the National League's 100th anniversary in 1976, the umpire blazers/light blue shirts included the league's centennial patch and the hats were designed in the \"pillbox\" style  with the year \"'76\" included on them. In 1977, the use of the outside (balloon) protector was outlawed for new umpires but grandfathered for existing umpires, with the last umpire that used the outside protector, [[Jerry Neudecker]], retiring in 1985. The use of ties with the blazers were gradually phased out; the last time they were worn in the World Series was in [[1975 World Series|1975]] and overall was in the [[1979 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] by [[George Maloney]], [[Terry Cooney]], and [[Nick Bremigan]]. In World Series games starting in [[1976 World Series|1976]], the umpires wore sweaters (light blue for National League umpires and off-white for American League umpires) instead of ties.\n\nIn 1980, Major League Baseball mandated that the umpires' uniforms be standardized, and they went to the American League pre-1973 style of blue blazers, grey slacks, and short sleeved light blue shirts; the American League began adding numbers to their umpire uniforms, with \"AL\" on their caps and National League umpires had \"NL\" on their caps. This style was pretty much the same (except for the use of windbreakers and sweaters later in the 1980s) through 1995. The league initials on the caps changed towards the late 1980s when the \"N\" and \"L\" were combined into a single letter, while the \"A\" and the \"L\" were interlocked.\n\nIn 1996, the button-down light blue shirt was replaced with a navy blue polo shirt with red and white trim on the collar and sleeve cuffs. The numbers were changed to red on the shirts, an \"N\" with the National League logo and an \"A\" with the American League logo on the hats. The American League used an optional red short-sleeved shirt (possibly a homage to the 1973-79 red blazers) that wasn't used by many umpires (the notable exceptions were [[Derryl Cousins]] and [[Dale Scott]], who frequently wore the red shirts while working home plate, even as their colleagues on the bases wore navy blue shirts). The National League added a light blue shirt in 1997, which became much more popular than the red shirts in the AL.\n\nBeginning in 2000, after the individual leagues' umpires were consolidated into a single staff, the 1996-99 uniform styles were carried over with \"MLB\" on the caps instead of the league designations. Since 2001, the uniforms switched to black blazers/windbreakers with grey slacks, with the hats now including the MLB logo (along with the short-sleeved light blue shirts), which remain relatively unchanged. The navy blue shirt was phased out in favor of black, and the light blue shirt was reintroduced after a brief experiment with gray. For the 2017 season, the umpires' jacket was black with light blue trim over the shoulders.\n\n==Famous umpires==\n{{see also|Honor Rolls of Baseball #Umpires|Baseball awards #Other individual awards}}\n\n[[File:Billklem.jpg|thumb|right|Longtime umpire [[Bill Klem]], a member of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]]]]\n\n===Hall of Fame===\nThe following ten umpires have been inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/umpires/umpiresinhof.shtml |title=Hall of Fame Umpires |website=[[Baseball Almanac]] |accessdate=August 21, 2017}}</ref>\n*Class of 1953 \u2013 [[Tom Connolly|Tommy Connolly]] (NL, 1898\u20131900; AL, 1901\u20131931) \n*Class of 1953 \u2013 [[Bill Klem]] ([[National League|NL]] 1905\u20131941)\n*Class of 1973 \u2013 [[Billy Evans]] ([[American League|AL]], 1906\u20131927) \n*Class of 1974 \u2013 [[Jocko Conlan]] ([[National League|NL]] 1941\u20131964) \n*Class of 1976 \u2013 [[Cal Hubbard]] ([[American League|AL]], 1936\u20131951) \n*Class of 1989 \u2013 [[Al Barlick]] ([[National League|NL]], 1940\u20131943, 1946\u20131955, 1958\u20131971) \n*Class of 1992 \u2013 [[Bill McGowan]] ([[American League|AL]], 1925\u20131954)\n*Class of 1999 \u2013 [[Nestor Chylak]] ([[American League|AL]], 1954\u20131978)  \n*Class of 2010 \u2013 [[Doug Harvey (umpire)|Doug Harvey]] ([[National League|NL]] 1962\u20131992) \n*Class of 2013 \u2013 [[Hank O'Day]] ([[National League|NL]], 1895, 1897\u20131911, 1913, 1915\u20131927)\n\nConlan and O'Day played in 128 and 232 major league games, respectively, prior to becoming professional umpires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/C/Pconlj102.htm|title=Jocko Conlan|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/O/Podayh101.htm|title=Hank O'Day|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref>\n\nSeveral ''player'' inductees to the Hall of Fame served as substitute umpires for a small number of games during the early years of baseball; these include [[Hughie Jennings]], [[Willie Keeler]], [[King Kelly]], and [[Chuck Klein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/index.html#Umpires|title=The Directory of Umpires|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref>  Additionally, Hall of Fame player inductees [[Tim Keefe]] and [[Ed Walsh]] umpired professionally in the major leagues after their playing careers ended.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Keefe|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/K/Pkeeft101.htm|work=Retrosheet.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ed Walsh|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/W/Pwalse101.htm|work=Retrosheet.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Numbers retired by the National and American Leagues===\n{{see also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}\nLike players, umpires are identified by numbers on their uniforms. National League umpires began wearing numbers in 1970 (though they were assigned numbers in the 1960s) and American League umpires were assigned and began wearing uniform numbers in 1980. The National League umpires' numbers were initially assigned in alphabetical order ([[Al Barlick]] wearing number 1, [[Ken Burkhart]] number 2, etc.) from 1970 to 1978, which meant that an umpire's number could change each year depending on retirements and other staff changes. In 1979, the National League changed the numbering system and thereafter a number's umpire did not change from year to year. At first, as new umpires, they would be assigned higher numbers (for example, in 1979, [[Dave Pallone]], [[Steve Fields]], [[Fred Brocklander]], and [[Lanny Harris]] were assigned numbers 26 to 29 instead of available numbers between 1 and 25). The National League numbering practice changed again in the mid-1980s, when new umpires were assigned previously used numbers (for example, in 1982 [[Gerry Davis (umpire)|Gerry Davis]] was assigned number 12, previously worn by [[Andy Olsen]], and in 1985 [[Tom Hallion]] was assigned number 20, previously worn by [[Ed Vargo]].)\n\nThe American League's number assignments were largely random. [[Bill Haller]], the senior American League umpire in 1980, wore number 1 until his retirement following the [[1982 World Series]], but the number was never reassigned.\n\nIn 2000, the American League and National League umpiring staffs were merged into a unified staff under the auspices of Major League Baseball, and all numbers were made available, including the numbers that had been retired by one of the leagues. (For example, the American League had retired [[Lou DiMuro]]'s number 16 after his death, but it was made available to his son [[Mike DiMuro|Mike]] after the staffs were unified.) In the event of duplications, the more senior umpire was given the first choice. (For example, [[Al Clark (umpire)|Al Clark]] in the AL and [[Jerry Layne]] in the NL both wore the number 24, but because Clark had more seniority he was assigned 24 and Layne number 26. When Clark was relieved of his duties in 2000, Layne was able to obtain number 24.)\n\nFrom time to time, Major League Baseball retires those numbers for umpires who have given outstanding service to the game, or in honor of umpires who have died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/feature.jsp?feature=retired_numbers/|title=Umpires: Feature|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nSince unified umpiring crews were established in 2000, all numbers are available to Major League Baseball umpires, as each retired number was reserved per league. Only one umpire number has been retired since the current format was established, 42, because of the [[Major League Baseball]] policy instituted in 1997.\n\n* #1 [[Bill Klem]] ([[National League|NL]], 1905\u201341); currently worn by [[Bruce Dreckman]]\n* #2 [[Nick Bremigan]] ([[American League|AL]], 1974\u201389); currently worn by [[Dan Bellino]]\n* #2 [[Jocko Conlan]] ([[National League|NL]], 1941\u201364); worn by [[Jerry Crawford]] during his tenure in the NL (1977\u20131999)\n* #3 [[Al Barlick]] ([[National League|NL]], 1940\u201343, 1946\u201355, 1958\u201371); currently worn by [[Bill Welke]]\n* #9 [[Bill Kunkel (baseball)|Bill Kunkel]] ([[American League|AL]], 1968\u201384); also a National Basketball Association referee.

Currently worn by [[Phil Cuzzi]].\n* #16 [[Lou DiMuro]] ([[American League|AL]], 1963\u201382); killed in an auto-related accident after a game in [[Arlington, Texas]]. \n* #42 [[Jackie Robinson]] (retired by Major League Baseball since April 15, 1997.)
