Championships''' began in 1985. They are run by the governing body, [[USA Cycling]]. Until 2006 the race was open to all nationalities, the first American to finish being named the winner and given a distinctive jersey. Since the championship in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], in 2006, all riders have had to be American.\n\nBefore 1985, only the amateur champions were named.\nFrom 1921 to 1964, the Amateur Bicycle League of America [[United States National Road Race Championships#See also|(ABLA) National Championships]] were held as an omnium of track-style events for Men, Women, and Juniors, rather than as a road race. In 1964 the American Cycling Newsletter (later [[Bicycling (magazine)|Bicycling]]) reported the results of a Flemington, NJ race as the national road racing championships, but these results do not appear in the [[USA Cycling]] list of winners.\n\n==Men==\n\n===Amateur===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 60%; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DDDDDD; font-weight:bold;

The average sleep time of a captive house mouse is reported to be 12.5 hours per day.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} They live in a wide variety of hidden places near food sources, and construct nests from various soft materials. Mice are territorial, and one dominant male usually lives together with several females and young. Dominant males respect each other's [[territory (animal)|territories]] and normally enter another's territory only if it is vacant. If two or more males are housed together in a cage, they often become aggressive unless they have been raised together from birth.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nHouse mice primarily feed on plant matter, but are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} They [[Coprophagia|eat their own faeces]] to acquire nutrients produced by [[bacteria]] in their intestines.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hilscher-Conklin, Caryl|year=1998|title=Rattus Biologicus: Coprophagy: Healthy Behavior For Your Rats|url=http://www.rmca.org/Articles/coprophagy.htm|work=Rat & Mouse Gazette}}</ref> House mice, like most other rodents, do not vomit.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Horn CC, Kimball BA, Wang H, Kaus J, Dienel S, Nagy A, Gathright GR, Yates BJ, Andrews PL|title=Why can't rodents vomit?

The presence or absence of the plug will not affect litter size either.<ref name=\":1\"/> This plug stays in place for some 24 hours. The [[gestation]] period is about 19\u201321 days, and they give birth to a litter of 3\u201314 young (average six to eight). One female can have 5 to 10 litters per year, so the mouse population can increase very quickly. Breeding occurs throughout the year. (However, animals living in the wild do not reproduce in the colder months, even though they do not [[Hibernation|hibernate]].)\n\nThe pups are born blind and without fur or ears. The ears are fully developed by the fourth day, fur begins to appear at about six days and the eyes open around 13 days after birth; the pups are weaned at around 21 days. Females reach sexual maturity at about six weeks of age and males at about eight weeks, but both can copulate as early as five weeks.

Such was the case of Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], who on 8 October 1940 marginalised the country's [[Jewry]] by introducing the bill culminating in the passage of the [[Law for Protection of the Nation|Law for the Protection of the Nation]] ({{lang-bg|Zakon za Zashtita na Naciyata}}), which entered into force in January 1941 and which restricted the rights and activities of Jews.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Saliently, it forbade the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to Jews.<ref name=\"ragaru\" /> [[Alexander Belev]] had been sent by the interior minister [[Petar Gabrovski]] to Germany in order to study the racial laws; the legislation was modelled on the racial code of Nazi Germany, the [[Nuremberg Laws]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://newpol.org/issue_post/rescue-bulgarias-jews-world-war-ii/|title=\"The Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews in World War II, by Rossen Vassilev.\"|work= Newpol.org. 2010.

Shortly thereafter in June 1942, Gabrovski created within the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior a Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs, and chose Belev to lead it. The new department began to prepare for the Final Solution.

The passing of the law by Parliament in January 1941 paved the way for the first deportations to take place in November of the same year. \n\nAnti-Jewish propaganda gradually intensified with Bulgaria's rising economic and political dependence on Nazi Germany. This led to the introduction of antisemitic legislation, starting with the Law for Protection of the Nation in 1940. This restricted the civil rights of Jews and was complemented by further laws, such as the establishment of a Commission on Jewish Affairs on 29 August 1942. The commission was tasked with the organisation of the expulsion of Jews and the liquidation of their property. This Act can be interpreted as the immediate precursor of the decision to deport Jews to extermination camps in March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Bulgarian Jews during the Holocaust \u2014 the Menace, the Rescue, the Aliya|first=Rumyana Dimitrova|last=Marinova-Christidi|url=https://shalom.bg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Holocoust-ENG.pdf|website=shalom.bg}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bulgarian government]] termed the deportations as \"resettlement,\" but Bulgarian citizens were not convinced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Expressions of dissent grew as Bulgarians protested against any Jews being deported from Bulgarian soil, and the [[Bulgarian government]] was flooded with petitions from organisations of writers and artists, lawyers, and religious leaders, among others.

The rise of [[Hitler]] saw an increasingly radicalised Bulgaria, as it eventually adopted anti-Semitic legislation, based on the German one. Bulgaria's alliance with Germany during [[World War II]] placed the former into a position of obedience and conformity. In addition, the Bulgarian government was ridden with politicians that held pro-fascist and anti-democratic sentiments. Such was the case of Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], who on 8 October 1940 marginalised the country's [[Jewry]] by introducing the bill culminating in the passage of the [[Law for Protection of the Nation|Law for the Protection of the Nation]] ({{lang-bg|Zakon za Zashtita na Naciyata}}), which entered into force in January 1941 and which restricted the rights and activities of Jews.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Saliently, it forbade the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to Jews.<ref name=\"ragaru\" /> [[Alexander Belev]] had been sent by the interior minister [[Petar Gabrovski]] to Germany in order to study the racial laws; the legislation was modelled on the racial code of Nazi Germany, the [[Nuremberg Laws]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://newpol.org/issue_post/rescue-bulgarias-jews-world-war-ii/|title=\"The Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews in World War II, by Rossen Vassilev.\"|work= Newpol.org. 2010.

The professional associations of Bulgarian lawyers, physicians, craftsmen and the Union of Artists' Societies opposed the law with petitions.<ref name=\"auto\" /> The Holy Synod, governing body of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], was also quite critical, with high clergy such as [[Stefan I of Bulgaria|Archbishop Stefan of Sofia]] and bishops Neofit of Vidin and [[Cyril of Bulgaria|Kyril of Plovdiv]] leading the opposition.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nIn January 1942, Germany outlined what it called the [[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]] at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. This included the creation of camps designed, not to house deportees, but solely to execute them as quickly as possible after they arrived. Shortly thereafter in June 1942, Gabrovski created within the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior a Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs, and chose Belev to lead it. The new department began to prepare for the Final Solution. Belev signed a secret agreement with Germany's [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] [[Theodor Dannecker]] on 22 February 1943 to deport 20,000 Jews, starting from the occupied Greek areas of [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]] and Yugoslav areas of [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Morava Valley|Pomoravlje]] first, which had been conquered by Germany but had since 1941 been under occupation by the Bulgarian authorities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe deportation of 11,343 Jews (7,122 from Macedonia and 4,221 from Thrace) was organised and executed by the Bulgarian authorities, with the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi-occupied Poland]] as their final destination.

The passing of the law by Parliament in January 1941 paved the way for the first deportations to take place in November of the same year. \n\nAnti-Jewish propaganda gradually intensified with Bulgaria's rising economic and political dependence on Nazi Germany. This led to the introduction of antisemitic legislation, starting with the Law for Protection of the Nation in 1940. This restricted the civil rights of Jews and was complemented by further laws, such as the establishment of a Commission on Jewish Affairs on 29 August 1942. The commission was tasked with the organisation of the expulsion of Jews and the liquidation of their property. This Act can be interpreted as the immediate precursor of the decision to deport Jews to extermination camps in March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Bulgarian Jews during the Holocaust \u2014 the Menace, the Rescue, the Aliya|first=Rumyana Dimitrova|last=Marinova-Christidi|url=https://shalom.bg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Holocoust-ENG.pdf|website=shalom.bg}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bulgarian government]] termed the deportations as \"resettlement,\" but Bulgarian citizens were not convinced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Expressions of dissent grew as Bulgarians protested against any Jews being deported from Bulgarian soil, and the [[Bulgarian government]] was flooded with petitions from organisations of writers and artists, lawyers, and religious leaders, among others.

Instead, prosecutions were mainly for \"incidental malfeasance\" and convictions were hard to secure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=140-141|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> Now fighting with the Soviets against the Nazis, the Bulgarian Army tried to shield from liability officers who had abused Jewish forced labourers and lawyers engaged in the liquidation of Jews' assets mostly escaped sanction.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=141|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> Most defendants were acquitted or received lenient penalties and most offenders were never charged.<ref name=\":5\" /> Two death sentences were handed down, including one for Alexander Belev, but he had already died in 1944 and was tried ''in absentia''.<ref name=\":5\" /> Shortly afterwards, records of the ''People's Court Panel VII'' trial were suppressed, including the \"abundant testimony\", and secreted, unpublished, in the exclusive archives of the communist [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]]'s Interior Ministry.

State-controlled [[historiography]] attributed the survival to principled and righteous popular action by the Bulgarian people inspired by the then-outlawed Bulgarian Communist Party in 1943. The fate of the Jews of Macedonia and Thrace was \"simply ignored\", by which means \"the narrative cast Bulgaria alongside [[Denmark in World War II|Denmark]] as a nation of rescuers, even exceeding that Scandinavian country in the percentage of Jews saved\".<ref name=\":5\" /> One work to make the comparison was Haim Oliver's ''We Were Saved: How the Jews in Bulgaria Were Kept from the Death Camps'', published in Bulgarian and in English in 1967. Most of Bulgaria's surviving Jews emigrated soon after the war, joining the global ''[[Aliyah]]''. Some Jews who stayed in the country were committed Communists that assisted in spreading the story of the 'rescue' through various media including articles in the state-controlled Sofia Jewish organization's annual volume ''Godishnik'', and a small museum in Sofia.<ref name=\":5\" /> A publication by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in 1978 was typical - it was entitled: ''The Struggle of the Bulgarian People for the Defence and Salvation of the Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War''.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the November 1989 fall of Communism in Bulgaria, the fate of Bulgaria's Jews remained \"a cornerstone of national pride\" and \"an unassailable historiographic ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''\".<ref name=\":5\" /> Historiographical debate focused on who should be credited with responsibility for the early 1943 'rescue'. The Tsar, the Church, and the legislators led by Dimitar Peshev all joined the Communists among those to whom responsibility was being apportioned.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn reaction to the view promulgated officially by Communist Bulgarian state, a dissenting view emerged that the Tsar Boris was not an antisemite or a convinced Nazi-sympathizer and should be credited with the Jews' survival.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=141-142|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> [[Binyamin Arditi]], an Israeli politician of Bulgarian Jewish origin and sometime chair of the pre-war Zionist Organization of Bulgaria in Sofia, published ''The Role of King Boris in the Expulsion of Bulgarian Jewry'' in 1952.

The particular molecule [[16S rRNA]] is key to the production of proteins in all organisms. Because this function is so central to life, organisms with mutations in their 16S&nbsp;rRNA are unlikely to survive, leading to great (but not absolute) stability in the structure of this nucleotide over generations. 16S&nbsp;rRNA is large enough to show organism-specific variations, but still small enough to be compared quickly. In 1977, Carl Woese, a microbiologist studying the genetic sequences of organisms, developed a new comparison method that involved splitting the RNA into fragments that could be sorted and compared with other fragments from other organisms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Woese CR, Fox GE | title = Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: the primary kingdoms | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 74 | issue = 11 | pages = 5088\u201390 | date = November 1977 | pmid = 270744 | pmc = 432104 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.74.11.5088 | bibcode = 1977PNAS...74.5088W }}</ref> The more similar the patterns between species, the more closely they are related.<ref>{{ cite book |last=Howland |first=John L. |date=2000 |title=The Surprising Archaea: Discovering Another Domain of Life |pages=25\u201330 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-511183-5 }}</ref>\n\nWoese used his new rRNA comparison method to categorize and contrast different organisms.

Salt-tolerant archaea (the [[Haloarchaea]]) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]], but unlike plants and [[cyanobacteria]], no known species of archaea does both. Archaea [[asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]] by [[binary fission]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]], or [[budding]]; unlike bacteria, no known species of Archaea forms [[endospore]]s.\n\nThe first observed archaea were [[extremophile]]s, living in extreme environments, such as [[hot spring]]s and [[salt lake]]s with no other organisms. Improved detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every [[habitat]], including soil, oceans, and [[marshland]]s. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in [[plankton]] may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. \n\nArchaea are a major part of [[Life|Earth's life]].
