His brother was [[Thomas Arundel]], Archbishop of Canterbury. His sister was [[Joan Fitzalan]], Countess of Hereford.\n\n== High office ==\n\n[[File:betchworth.castle.jpg|thumbnail|right|Betchworth Castle]]\n\nJohn was appointed [[Lord Marshal of England]] by [[Richard II of England]] in 1377, and summoned to the [[House of Lords]] on 4 August 1377, by writ directed ''Johanni de Arundell''. He served as Lord Marshal until 1379.\n\nOn 26 July 1379 he was given licence to [[crenellate]] (i.e., permission to fortify) a stone castle on the site of an 11th-century earthwork fortress in Surrey. Over the years since then the structure was rebuilt and remodelled and its remains are now known as [[Betchworth Castle]].\n\n== Naval victory ==\n\nBeing in command of a naval expedition in aid to the [[Duke of Brittany]], he defeated the French fleet off the coast of [[Cornwall]].\n\n== Death at sea ==\n\nCommanding a force with the purpose of bringing relief to the [[Duke of Brittany]], Sir John was compelled to wait for stronger winds. During this wait he decided to take refuge in a nunnery, where his men \"took no notice of the sanctity of the place and... violently assaulted and raped\"<ref name=\"Walsingham\">Thomas Walsingham, \"Chronica Maiora\"</ref> those they found inside.

[[Thomas Walsingham]] reports that during the panic of the storm, Sir John murdered those of his men who refused to make for shore for fear of being shipwrecked upon the rocks. Subsequently, after safely arriving on an island off the Irish coast, Sir John and his boat captain were swept back into the sea and drowned.<ref name=\"Walsingham\" />\n\nAccording to [[Thomas Walsingham]]'s story, FitzAlan's men profaned a convent at or near [[Southampton]], and abducted many of its occupants. The fleet was then pursued by a violent tempest, when the wretched nuns who had been carried off were thrown overboard to lighten the ships. The vessels were, however, wrecked on the Irish coast, near [[Scariff]] according to some authorities, but at [[Cape Clear Island]] according to others. Sir John Arundell, together with his esquires, and other men of high birth, were drowned, and twenty-five ships were lost with most of their crews.

Like all the other Arkansas regiments raised in the first wave of recruiting in 1861, they were taken into Confederate armies east of the Mississippi River, and only the few survivors made it back home after the war.  The 9th was present, across the river at Columbus Kentucky during the Battle of Belmont, Missouri and was subsequently retained at Bowling Green, Kentucky, for the defense of that post during the winter of 1861-1862. The regiment was assigned to General Bowen's Brigade, consisting of the 9th and [[10th Arkansas Infantry Regiment|10th Arkansas]], 5th Missouri and 10th Mississippi Infantry Regiments before they were moved to Kentucky.<ref name=\"Confederate Military History\">Harrell, Col.

After the losses of [[Fort Henry (site of the Battle of Fort Henry)|Fort Henry]] and [[Fort Donelson]] in February 1862, Confederate General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. and then retreated through western Tennessee to Corinth, Mississippi. On March 29, 1862, the [[Army of Central Kentucky]] was merged into the [[Army of Mississippi]] in preparation for the Battle of Shiloh. Bowen's Brigade, including the 9th and 10th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, was then placed in General Brigadier General [[John C. Breckinridge]]'s Reserve Corps as part of the [[Army of Mississippi]]. It fought gallantly at Shiloh, charging repeatedly upon the \"Hornet's Nest\" where it lost Lieutenant Colonel Dunlop. It was through this regiment that General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] rode from the rear to the front, with a tin cup he had appropriated earlier that morning, saying \"Men of Arkansas, the enemy is stubborn. I want you to show General Beauregard and General Bragg what you can do with your bayonets and toothpicks!\" The regiment went forward with a cheer and passed him at a run; in five minutes 130 men of their ranks were killed or wounded, but they did not falter. Lieutenant Duckworth was killed at the head of his company, and Captain Wallace was wounded. It closed up and disappeared into the thicket in front, followed by the whole Confederate line, and the enemy was silenced in twenty minutes. General Johnston, however, received a mortal wound while leading this charge, and shortly thereafter bled to death.  The unit reported 17 killed and 115 wounded at Shiloh.<ref name=\"nps\"/><ref>United States. War Department.

The 9th served in Brigadier General [[Abraham Buford]]'s brigade of Major General [[William W. Loring]]'s division of Lieutenant General [[John C. Pemberton]]'s Confederate Army at Champion Hill, and following that battle, Loring retreated north to join General [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army near Jackson rather than being trapped with the rest of Pemberton's army in the Vicksburg defenses. Johnston had been gathering troops at Jackson, intending to relieve pressure on Lt. Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]]'s beleaguered garrison. Johnston cautiously advanced his 30,000 soldiers toward the rear of Grant's army surrounding Vicksburg.<ref name=\"Korn, Jerry 1985. Page 156\">Korn, Jerry, and the Editors of Time-Life Books.

By July 1, 1863, Johnston's force was in position along the [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]]. Sherman used the newly arrived [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]] to counter this threat. On July 5, the day after the surrender of Vicksburg was made official; Sherman was free to move against Johnston. Johnston hastily withdrew his force across the [[Battle of Big Black River Bridge|Big Black River]] and [[Battle of Champion's Hill|Champion's Hill]] battlefields with Sherman in pursuit. Sherman had with him the IX Corps, [[XV Corps (Union Army)|XV Corps]], [[XIII Corps (Union Army)|XIII Corps]], and a detachment of the [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]]. On July 10 the Union Army had taken up position around Jackson.  The heaviest fighting in the [[Siege of Jackson]] came on July 11 during an unsuccessful Union attack, which resulted in heavy casualties.<ref>Gue, Benjamin F.

A variation of the first national flag with twelve stars, nine describing a circle and three within it. More recent research now indicates that this flag most likely belonged to the [[11th Arkansas Infantry Regiment]] and was found, along with the regiment's baggage in Fort Thompson after the unit evacuated [[Battle of Island No. 10|Island No. 10]]. The 11th Arkansas flag was returned to by the State of Michigan in 1941. It is a first Confederate national flag pattern variation made of cotton and cotton damask, measuring 46\" x 69\" and is currently in the collection of the Old State House.<ref>Dedmondt, Glenn \"The Flags Of Civil War Arkansas\", (Pelican Publishing Co., 2009). {{ISBN|978-1-58980-190-5}}.

The 9th was present, across the river at Columbus Kentucky during the Battle of Belmont, Missouri and was subsequently retained at Bowling Green, Kentucky, for the defense of that post during the winter of 1861-1862.

After the losses of [[Fort Henry (site of the Battle of Fort Henry)|Fort Henry]] and [[Fort Donelson]] in February 1862, Confederate General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. and then retreated through western Tennessee to Corinth, Mississippi. On March 29, 1862, the [[Army of Central Kentucky]] was merged into the [[Army of Mississippi]] in preparation for the Battle of Shiloh. Bowen's Brigade, including the 9th and 10th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, was then placed in General Brigadier General [[John C. Breckinridge]]'s Reserve Corps as part of the [[Army of Mississippi]]. It fought gallantly at Shiloh, charging repeatedly upon the \"Hornet's Nest\" where it lost Lieutenant Colonel Dunlop. It was through this regiment that General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] rode from the rear to the front, with a tin cup he had appropriated earlier that morning, saying \"Men of Arkansas, the enemy is stubborn. I want you to show General Beauregard and General Bragg what you can do with your bayonets and toothpicks!\" The regiment went forward with a cheer and passed him at a run; in five minutes 130 men of their ranks were killed or wounded, but they did not falter. Lieutenant Duckworth was killed at the head of his company, and Captain Wallace was wounded. It closed up and disappeared into the thicket in front, followed by the whole Confederate line, and the enemy was silenced in twenty minutes. General Johnston, however, received a mortal wound while leading this charge, and shortly thereafter bled to death.

It is a first Confederate national flag pattern variation made of cotton and cotton damask, measuring 46\" x 69\" and is currently in the collection of the Old State House.<ref>Dedmondt, Glenn \"The Flags Of Civil War Arkansas\", (Pelican Publishing Co., 2009). {{ISBN|978-1-58980-190-5}}.

He was the son of [[Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk]] and Lady Anne Somerset, daughter of [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester]] and Elizabeth Dormer. He was summoned to the House of Lords in his own right as Baron Mowbray in 1678. His unhappy marriage was a subject of much gossip, and ended in divorce. \n\n==Marriage, separation and divorce==\n\nHe married [[Mary Howard, Duchess of Norfolk (d. 1705)|Mary Mordaunt]], the only  surviving daughter and heiress of the [[Henry Mordaunt, 2nd Earl of Peterborough|2nd Earl of Peterborough]] and Penelope O'Brien. They  separated in 1685. He  divorced  her for her  [[adultery]]  with Sir John Germain in  1700, after  a previous attempt at [[divorce]]  in 1692 had failed when the  House of Lords threw out his private  Divorce Bill. Although he succeeded in obtaining damages in an action for [[criminal conversation]], the details were so sordid that he may well have regretted the step, especially since the jury reduced his claim for \u00a3100,000 damages to \u00a366,  for which they were severely reprimanded by the judge. The Duke was evidently in no position to condemn his wife's conduct: even his own counsel called it frankly a case of [[the pot calling the kettle black]].\n\nHe died without children, and  was succeeded by his nephew, [[Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk]]. His former wife married secondly [[Sir John Germain, 1st Baronet]], who had been her lover for many years. She  died in 1705.\n\nHe was rarely on good terms with his father, particularly after 1677 when his father married [[Jane Bickerton]], his mistress of many years standing,  an act which caused a violent family quarrel.<ref>Kenyon, J.P.

The ploy  seems to have succeeded; although his father was charged with [[recusancy]] in 1680, the charge was quickly dropped. While the senior Howard line survived unscathed, their cousin [[William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford]], was executed for his supposed part in the Plot in December 1680.<ref>Kenyon p.232</ref> Henry as a peer in his own right, [[Baron Mowbray]], sat as one of the peers who tried him. It is a sign of his moral courage and independent judgment, given the anti-Catholic feeling in the country, that he voted Not Guilty. This was the more notable since according to [[John Evelyn]], of Stafford's extended family in the [[House of Lords]], (eight of them in all),  he was the only one to do so, Stafford being a man \"not beloved by his family\".<ref>Evelyn  ''Diary''  7 December 1680</ref>\n\nHe became a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1672. His father was already a fellow  and  was a generous benefactor of the Society.\n\nOn 20 June 1685, he was appointed Colonel of the [[Suffolk Regiment]], which at the time was called the Duke of Norfolk's Regiment of Foot.

''The Stuart Constitution''  2nd Edition Cambridge University Press p.447</ref> he used his influence in the 1685 General Election to return members entirely loyal to the Crown (as his father had in 1673 when he found a safe seat at [[Castle Rising (UK Parliament constituency)|Castle Rising]]  for [[Samuel Pepys]]).  By 1688, however, he was on bad terms with [[James II]], openly disapproving of the King's aggressive policy of  Catholic championship. When asked to question his constituents on whether they favoured repeal of the [[Test Act]], he replied bluntly that he knew that all those in favour of repeal would fit comfortably in one coach.<ref>Kenyon, J.P.

{"title_page": "Tagged union", "text_new": "In [[computer science]], a '''tagged union''', also called a '''[[variant type|variant]]''', '''variant record''', '''choice type''', '''discriminated union''', '''[[disjoint union]]''', '''sum type''' or '''[[coproduct]]''', is a [[data structure]] used to hold a value that could take on several different, but fixed, types. Only one of the types can be in use at any one time, and a '''tag''' field explicitly indicates which one is in use. It can be thought of as a type that has several \"cases\", each of which should be handled correctly when that type is manipulated. Like ordinary [[Union (computer science)|unions]], tagged unions can save storage by overlapping storage areas for each type, since only one is in use at a time.\n\n==Description==\nTagged unions are most important in [[functional language]]s such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], where they are called '''datatypes''' (see [[algebraic data type]]) and the compiler is able to verify that all cases of a tagged union are always handled, avoiding many types of errors. They can, however, be constructed in nearly any [[Programming language|language]], and are much safer than untagged unions, often simply called unions, which are similar but do not explicitly keep track of which member of the union is currently in use.\n\nTagged unions are often accompanied by the concept of a [[type constructor]], which is similar but not the same as a [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]] for a class. Type constructors produce a tagged union type, given the initial tag type and the corresponding type.\n\nMathematically, tagged unions correspond to ''[[disjoint union|disjoint]]'' or ''discriminated unions'', usually written using +. Given an element of a disjoint union ''A'' + ''B'',  it is possible to determine whether it came from ''A'' or ''B''. If an element lies in both, there will be two effectively distinct copies of the value in ''A'' + ''B'', one from ''A'' and one from ''B''.\n\nIn [[type theory]], a tagged union is called a '''sum type'''.  Sum types are the [[dual (mathematics)|dual]] of [[product type]]s.  Notations vary, but usually the sum type <math>A+B</math> comes with two introduction forms ([[injection (mathematics)|injection]]s) <math>\\text{inj}_1\\colon A \\to A+B</math> and <math>\\text{inj}_2\\colon B \\to A+B</math>.  The elimination form is case analysis, known as [[pattern matching]] in [[ML (programming language)|ML-style]] programming languages: if <math>e</math> has type <math>A+B</math> and <math>e_1</math> and <math>e_2</math> have type <math>\\tau</math> under the assumptions <math>x\\colon A</math> and <math>y\\colon B</math> respectively, then the term \n<math>\\mathsf{case}\\ e\\ \\mathsf{of}\\ x \\Rightarrow e_1 \\mid y \\Rightarrow e_2</math> has type <math>\\tau</math>.  The sum type corresponds to [[Intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] logical [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] under the [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]].\n\nAn [[enumerated type]] can be seen as a degenerate case: a tagged union of [[unit type]]s.  It corresponds to a set of nullary constructors and may be implemented as a simple tag variable, since it holds no additional data besides the value of the tag.\n\nMany programming techniques and data structures, including [[rope (data structure)|rope]], [[lazy evaluation]], [[class hierarchy]] (see below), [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], [[CDR coding]], the [[indirection bit]] and other kinds of [[tagged pointer]]s, etc. \nare usually implemented using some sort of tagged union.\n\nA tagged union can be seen as the simplest kind of [[self-describing]] [[comparison of data serialization formats|data format]].\nThe tag of the tagged union can be seen as the simplest kind of [[metadata]].\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\nThe primary advantage of a tagged union over an untagged union is that all accesses are safe, and the compiler can even check that all cases are handled. Untagged unions depend on program logic to correctly identify the currently active field, which may result in strange behavior and hard-to-find bugs if that logic fails.\n\nThe primary advantage of a tagged union over a simple [[record (computer science)|record]] containing a field for each type is that it saves storage by overlapping storage for all the types. Some implementations reserve enough storage for the largest type, while others dynamically adjust the size of a tagged union value as needed. When the value is [[Immutable object|immutable]], it is simple to allocate just as much storage as is needed.\n\nThe main disadvantage of tagged unions is that the tag occupies space. Since there are usually a small number of alternatives, the tag can often be squeezed into 2 or 3 bits wherever space can be found, but sometimes even these bits are not available. In this case, a helpful alternative may be '''folded''', '''computed''' or '''encoded tags''', where the tag value is dynamically computed from the contents of the union field. Common examples of this are the use of ''reserved values'', where, for example, a function returning a positive number may return -1 to indicate failure, and [[sentinel value]]s, most often used in [[tagged pointer]]s.\n\nSometimes, untagged unions are used to perform bit-level conversions between types, called reinterpret casts in C++. Tagged unions are not intended for this purpose; typically a new value is assigned whenever the tag is changed.\n\nMany languages support, to some extent, a [[Top type|universal data type]], which is a type that includes every value of every other type, and often a way is provided to test the actual type of a value of the universal type. These are sometimes referred to as ''variants''. While universal data types are comparable to tagged unions in their formal definition, typical tagged unions include a relatively small number of cases, and these cases form different ways of expressing a single coherent concept, such as a data structure node or instruction. Also, there is an expectation that every possible case of a tagged union will be dealt with when it is used. The values of a universal data type are not related and there is no feasible way to deal with them all.\n\nLike [[option type]]s and [[exception handling]], tagged unions are sometimes used to handle the occurrence of exceptional results.  Often these tags are folded into the type as \"reserved values\", and their occurrence is not consistently checked: this is a fairly common source of programming errors.  This use of tagged unions can be formalized as a [[monads in functional programming|monad]] with the following functions:\n\n:<math>\\text{return}\\colon A \\to \\left( A + E \\right) = a \\mapsto \\text{value} \\, a</math>\n:<math>\\text{bind}\\colon \\left( A + E \\right) \\to \\left(A \\to \\left(B + E \\right) \\right) \\to \\left( B + E \\right) = a \\mapsto f \\mapsto \\begin{cases} \\text{err} \\, e & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{err} \\, e\\\\ f \\, a' & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{value} \\, a' \\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhere \"value\" and \"err\" are the constructors of the union type, ''A'' and ''B'' are valid result types and ''E'' is the type of error conditions.  Alternately, the same monad may be described by ''return'' and two additional functions, ''fmap'' and ''join'':\n\n:<math>\\text{fmap} \\colon (A \\to B) \\to \\left( \\left( A + E \\right) \\to \\left( B + E \\right) \\right) = f \\mapsto a \\mapsto \\begin{cases} \\text{err} \\, e & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{err} \\, e \\\\ \\text{value} \\, \\text{(} \\, f \\, a' \\, \\text{)} & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{value} \\, a' \\end{cases}</math>\n:<math>\\text{join} \\colon ((A + E ) + E) \\to (A + E) = a \\mapsto \\begin{cases} \\text{err} \\, e & \\mbox{if} \\ a = \\text{err} \\, e\\\\ \\text{err} \\, e & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{value} \\, \\text{(err} \\, e \\, \\text{)} \\\\ \\text{value} \\, a' & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{value} \\, \\text{(value} \\, a' \\, \\text{)} \\end{cases}</math>\n\n==Examples==\nSay we wanted to build a [[binary tree]] of integers. In ML, we would do this by creating a datatype like this:\n\n<source lang=\"sml\">\ndatatype tree = Leaf\n              | Node of (int * tree * tree)\n</source>\n\nThis is a tagged union with two cases: one, the leaf, is used to terminate a path of the tree, and functions much like a null value would in imperative languages. The other branch holds a node, which contains an integer and a left and right subtree. Leaf and Node are the constructors, which enable us to actually produce a particular tree, such as:\n\n<source lang=\"sml\">\nNode(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))\n</source>\n\nwhich corresponds to this tree:\n\n[[Image:tagged_union_tree.svg|The tree produced by the above constructors|center]]\n\nNow we can easily write a typesafe function that, say, counts the number of nodes in the tree:\n\n<source lang=\"sml\">\nfun countNodes(Leaf) = 0\n  | countNodes(Node(int, left, right)) =\n      1 + countNodes(left) + countNodes(right)\n</source>\n\n==Timeline of language support==\n\n===1960s===\nIn [[ALGOL 68]], tagged unions are called ''united modes'', the tag is implicit, and the <code>'''case'''</code> construct is used to determine which field is tagged:\n\n<code>'''mode''' '''node''' = '''union''' ('''real''', '''int''', '''compl''', '''string''');</code>\n\nUsage example for <code>'''union'''</code> <code>'''case'''</code> of <code>'''node'''</code>:\n\n '''node''' n := \"1234\";\n &nbsp;\n '''case''' n '''in'''\n   ('''real''' r):   print((\"real:\", r)),\n   ('''int''' i):    print((\"int:\", i)),\n   ('''compl''' c):  print((\"compl:\", c)),\n   ('''string''' s): print((\"string:\", s))\n   '''out'''         print((\"?:\", n))\n '''esac'''\n\n===1970s & 1980s===\nAlthough primarily only [[functional programming language|functional languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (from 1990s) give a central role to tagged unions and have the power to check that all cases are handled, other languages have support for tagged unions as well. However, in practice they can be less efficient in non-functional languages due to optimizations enabled by functional language compilers that can eliminate explicit tag checks and [[Type erasure|avoid explicit storage of tags]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[Ada programming language|Ada]], and [[Modula-2]] call them '''variant records''' (formally '''discriminated type''' in Ada), and require the tag field to be manually created and the tag values specified, as in this Pascal example:\n\n<source lang=\"pascal\">\ntype shapeKind = (square, rectangle, circle);\n     shape = record\n                centerx : integer;\n                centery : integer;\n                case kind : shapeKind of\n                   square : (side : integer);\n                   rectangle : (length, height : integer);\n                   circle : (radius : integer);\n\t      end;\n</source>\n\nand this Ada equivalent:\n<source lang=\"ada\">\ntype Shape_Kind is (Square, Rectangle, Circle);\ntype Shape (Kind : Shape_Kind) is record\n   Center_X : Integer;\n   Center_Y : Integer;\n   case Kind is\n      when Square =>\n         Side : Integer;\n      when Rectangle =>\n         Length, Height : Integer;\n      when Circle =>\n         Radius : Integer;\n   end case;\nend record;\n\n-- Any attempt to access a member whose existence depends\n-- on a particular value of the discriminant, while the\n-- discriminant is not the expected one, raises an error.\n</source>\n\nIn [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], a tagged union can be created from untagged unions using a strict access discipline where the tag is always checked:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nenum ShapeKind { Square, Rectangle, Circle };\n\nstruct Shape {\n    int centerx;\n    int centery;\n    enum ShapeKind kind;\n    union {\n        struct { int side; };           /* Square */\n        struct { int length, height; }; /* Rectangle */\n        struct { int radius; };         /* Circle */\n    };\n};\n\nint getSquareSide(struct Shape* s) {\n    assert(s->kind == Square);\n    return s->side;\n}\n\nvoid setSquareSide(struct Shape* s, int side) {\n    s->kind = Square;\n    s->side = side;\n}\n\n/* and so on */\n</source>\n\nAs long as the union fields are only accessed through the functions, the accesses will be safe and correct. The same approach can be used for encoded tags; we simply decode the tag and then check it on each access. If the inefficiency of these tag checks is a concern, they may be automatically removed in the final version.\n\nC and C++ also have language support for one particular tagged union: the possibly-null [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]. This may be compared to the <code>option</code> type in ML or the <code>Maybe</code> type in Haskell, and can be seen as a [[tagged pointer]]: a tagged union (with an encoded tag) of two types:\n* Valid pointers,\n* A [[null pointer]] type with only one value, <code>null</code>, indicating an exceptional condition.\nUnfortunately, C compilers do not verify that the null case is always handled, and this is a particularly prevalent source of errors in C code, since there is a tendency to ignore exceptional cases.\n\n===2000s===\nOne advanced dialect of C called [[Cyclone programming language|Cyclone]] has extensive built-in support for tagged unions.<ref>http://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Tagged%20Unions</ref>\n\nThe enum types in the [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Haxe (programming language)|Haxe]] and [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] languages also work as tagged unions.\n\nThe variant library from [[Boost C++ Libraries|Boost]] has demonstrated it was possible to implement a safe tagged union as a library in C++, visitable using function objects.\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\nstruct display : boost::static_visitor<void>\n{\n    void operator()(int i)\n    {\n        std::cout << \"It's an int, with value \" << i << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    void operator()(const std::string& s)\n    {\n        std::cout << \"It's a string, with value \" << s << std::endl;\n    }\n};\n\nboost::variant<int, std::string> v = 42;\nboost::apply_visitor(display(), v);\n\nboost::variant<int, std::string> v = \"hello world\";\nboost::apply_visitor(display(), v);\n</source>\n\n[[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] has case classes:\n<source lang=\"scala\">\nsealed abstract class Tree\ncase object Leaf extends Tree\ncase class Node(value: Int, left: Tree, right: Tree) extends Tree\n\nval tree = Node(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))\n</source>\n\nBecause the class hierarchy is sealed, the compiler can check that all cases are handled in a pattern match:\n<source lang=\"scala\">\ntree match {\n  case Node(x, _, _) => println(\"top level node value: \" + x)\n  case Leaf          => println(\"top level node is a leaf\")\n}\n</source>\n\nScala's case classes also permit reuse through subtyping:\n\n<source lang=\"scala\">\nsealed abstract class Shape(centerX: Int, centerY: Int)\ncase class Square(side: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)\ncase class Rectangle(length: Int, height: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)\ncase class Circle(radius: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)\n</source>\n\n[[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]] has discriminated unions:\n\n<source lang=\"fsharp\">\ntype Tree =\n  | Leaf\n  | Node of value: int * left: Tree * right: Tree\n\nlet tree = Node(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))\n</source>\n\nBecause the defined cases are exhaustive, the compiler can check that all cases are handled in a pattern match:\n<source lang=\"fsharp\">\nmatch tree with\n| Node (x, _, _) -> printfn \"top level node value: %i\" x\n| Leaf           -> printfn \"top level node is a leaf\"\n</source>\n\n[[Haxe]]'s enums also work as tagged unions<ref>{{cite web|title=Using Enums -

For example:\n<source lang=\"typescript\">\n\ntype Tree = {\n    type:\n    | [\"node\", {\n        left: Tree,\n        right: Tree\n    }]\n    | [\"leaf\", {\n        value: string\n    }]\n}\n\nfunction visit(t: Tree) {\n    switch (t.type[0]) {\n        case \"leaf\": {\n            const s = t.type[1]\n            console.log(s.value)\n            break\n        }\n        case \"node\": {\n            const s = t.type[1]\n            visit(s.left)\n            visit(s.right)\n            break\n        }\n        default:\n            assertUnreachable(t.type[0])\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n== Class hierarchies as tagged unions ==\nIn a typical [[class hierarchy]] in [[object-oriented programming]], each subclass can encapsulate data unique to that class. The metadata used to perform [[virtual method]] lookup (for example, the object's [[virtual method table|vtable]] pointer in most C++ implementations) identifies the subclass and so effectively acts as a tag identifying the particular data stored by the instance (see [[RTTI]]).\nAn object's [[Constructor (computer science)|constructor]] sets this tag, and it remains constant throughout the object's lifetime.\n\nNevertheless, a class hierarchy involves true [[subtype polymorphism]]; it can be extended by creating further subclasses of the same base type, which could not be handled correctly under a tag/dispatch model.  Hence, it is usually not possible to do case analysis or dispatch on a subobject's 'tag' as one would for tagged unions.  Some languages such as [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] allow base classes to be \"sealed\", and unify tagged unions with sealed base classes.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Discriminator]], the type tag for discriminated unions in [[CORBA]]\n* [[Variant type]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.boost.org/libs/variant/index.html boost::variant] is a C++ typesafe discriminated union\n*[http://www.digitalmars.com/d/phobos/std_variant.html std.variant] is an implementation of variant type in [[D (programming language)|D]] 2.0\n\n{{data types}}\n\n[[Category:Data types]]\n[[Category:Type theory]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Pascal code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example ALGOL 68 code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example C code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example C++ code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Ada code]]\n", "text_old": "In [[computer science]], a '''tagged union''', also called a '''[[variant type|variant]]''', '''variant record''', '''choice type''', '''discriminated union''', '''[[disjoint union]]''', '''sum type''' or '''[[coproduct]]''', is a [[data structure]] used to hold a value that could take on several different, but fixed, types. Only one of the types can be in use at any one time, and a '''tag''' field explicitly indicates which one is in use. It can be thought of as a type that has several \"cases\", each of which should be handled correctly when that type is manipulated. Like ordinary [[Union (computer science)|unions]], tagged unions can save storage by overlapping storage areas for each type, since only one is in use at a time.\n\n==Description==\nTagged unions are most important in [[functional language]]s such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], where they are called '''datatypes''' (see [[algebraic data type]]) and the compiler is able to verify that all cases of a tagged union are always handled, avoiding many types of errors. They can, however, be constructed in nearly any [[Programming language|language]], and are much safer than untagged unions, often simply called unions, which are similar but do not explicitly keep track of which member of the union is currently in use.\n\nTagged unions are often accompanied by the concept of a [[type constructor]], which is similar but not the same as a [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]] for a class. Type constructors produce a tagged union type, given the initial tag type and the corresponding type.\n\nMathematically, tagged unions correspond to ''[[disjoint union|disjoint]]'' or ''discriminated unions'', usually written using +. Given an element of a disjoint union ''A'' + ''B'',  it is possible to determine whether it came from ''A'' or ''B''. If an element lies in both, there will be two effectively distinct copies of the value in ''A'' + ''B'', one from ''A'' and one from ''B''.\n\nIn [[type theory]], a tagged union is called a '''sum type'''.  Sum types are the [[dual (mathematics)|dual]] of [[product type]]s.  Notations vary, but usually the sum type <math>A+B</math> comes with two introduction forms ([[injection (mathematics)|injection]]s) <math>\\text{inj}_1\\colon A \\to A+B</math> and <math>\\text{inj}_2\\colon B \\to A+B</math>.  The elimination form is case analysis, known as [[pattern matching]] in [[ML (programming language)|ML-style]] programming languages: if <math>e</math> has type <math>A+B</math> and <math>e_1</math> and <math>e_2</math> have type <math>\\tau</math> under the assumptions <math>x\\colon A</math> and <math>y\\colon B</math> respectively, then the term \n<math>\\mathsf{case}\\ e\\ \\mathsf{of}\\ x \\Rightarrow e_1 \\mid y \\Rightarrow e_2</math> has type <math>\\tau</math>.  The sum type corresponds to [[Intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] logical [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] under the [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]].\n\nAn [[enumerated type]] can be seen as a degenerate case: a tagged union of [[unit type]]s.  It corresponds to a set of nullary constructors and may be implemented as a simple tag variable, since it holds no additional data besides the value of the tag.\n\nMany programming techniques and data structures, including [[rope (data structure)|rope]], [[lazy evaluation]], [[class hierarchy]] (see below), [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], [[CDR coding]], the [[indirection bit]] and other kinds of [[tagged pointer]]s, etc. \nare usually implemented using some sort of tagged union.\n\nA tagged union can be seen as the simplest kind of [[self-describing]] [[comparison of data serialization formats|data format]].\nThe tag of the tagged union can be seen as the simplest kind of [[metadata]].\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\nThe primary advantage of a tagged union over an untagged union is that all accesses are safe, and the compiler can even check that all cases are handled. Untagged unions depend on program logic to correctly identify the currently active field, which may result in strange behavior and hard-to-find bugs if that logic fails.\n\nThe primary advantage of a tagged union over a simple [[record (computer science)|record]] containing a field for each type is that it saves storage by overlapping storage for all the types. Some implementations reserve enough storage for the largest type, while others dynamically adjust the size of a tagged union value as needed. When the value is [[Immutable object|immutable]], it is simple to allocate just as much storage as is needed.\n\nThe main disadvantage of tagged unions is that the tag occupies space. Since there are usually a small number of alternatives, the tag can often be squeezed into 2 or 3 bits wherever space can be found, but sometimes even these bits are not available. In this case, a helpful alternative may be '''folded''', '''computed''' or '''encoded tags''', where the tag value is dynamically computed from the contents of the union field. Common examples of this are the use of ''reserved values'', where, for example, a function returning a positive number may return -1 to indicate failure, and [[sentinel value]]s, most often used in [[tagged pointer]]s.\n\nSometimes, untagged unions are used to perform bit-level conversions between types, called reinterpret casts in C++. Tagged unions are not intended for this purpose; typically a new value is assigned whenever the tag is changed.\n\nMany languages support, to some extent, a [[Top type|universal data type]], which is a type that includes every value of every other type, and often a way is provided to test the actual type of a value of the universal type. These are sometimes referred to as ''variants''. While universal data types are comparable to tagged unions in their formal definition, typical tagged unions include a relatively small number of cases, and these cases form different ways of expressing a single coherent concept, such as a data structure node or instruction. Also, there is an expectation that every possible case of a tagged union will be dealt with when it is used. The values of a universal data type are not related and there is no feasible way to deal with them all.\n\nLike [[option type]]s and [[exception handling]], tagged unions are sometimes used to handle the occurrence of exceptional results.  Often these tags are folded into the type as \"reserved values\", and their occurrence is not consistently checked: this is a fairly common source of programming errors.  This use of tagged unions can be formalized as a [[monads in functional programming|monad]] with the following functions:\n\n:<math>\\text{return}\\colon A \\to \\left( A + E \\right) = a \\mapsto \\text{value} \\, a</math>\n:<math>\\text{bind}\\colon \\left( A + E \\right) \\to \\left(A \\to \\left(B + E \\right) \\right) \\to \\left( B + E \\right) = a \\mapsto f \\mapsto \\begin{cases} \\text{err} \\, e & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{err} \\, e\\\\ f \\, a' & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{value} \\, a' \\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhere \"value\" and \"err\" are the constructors of the union type, ''A'' and ''B'' are valid result types and ''E'' is the type of error conditions.  Alternately, the same monad may be described by ''return'' and two additional functions, ''fmap'' and ''join'':\n\n:<math>\\text{fmap} \\colon (A \\to B) \\to \\left( \\left( A + E \\right) \\to \\left( B + E \\right) \\right) = f \\mapsto a \\mapsto \\begin{cases} \\text{err} \\, e & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{err} \\, e \\\\ \\text{value} \\, \\text{(} \\, f \\, a' \\, \\text{)} & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{value} \\, a' \\end{cases}</math>\n:<math>\\text{join} \\colon ((A + E ) + E) \\to (A + E) = a \\mapsto \\begin{cases} \\text{err} \\, e & \\mbox{if} \\ a = \\text{err} \\, e\\\\ \\text{err} \\, e & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{value} \\, \\text{(err} \\, e \\, \\text{)} \\\\ \\text{value} \\, a' & \\text{if} \\ a = \\text{value} \\, \\text{(value} \\, a' \\, \\text{)} \\end{cases}</math>\n\n==Examples==\nSay we wanted to build a [[binary tree]] of integers. In ML, we would do this by creating a datatype like this:\n\n<source lang=\"sml\">\ndatatype tree = Leaf\n              | Node of (int * tree * tree)\n</source>\n\nThis is a tagged union with two cases: one, the leaf, is used to terminate a path of the tree, and functions much like a null value would in imperative languages. The other branch holds a node, which contains an integer and a left and right subtree. Leaf and Node are the constructors, which enable us to actually produce a particular tree, such as:\n\n<source lang=\"sml\">\nNode(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))\n</source>\n\nwhich corresponds to this tree:\n\n[[Image:tagged_union_tree.svg|The tree produced by the above constructors|center]]\n\nNow we can easily write a typesafe function that, say, counts the number of nodes in the tree:\n\n<source lang=\"sml\">\nfun countNodes(Leaf) = 0\n  | countNodes(Node(int, left, right)) =\n      1 + countNodes(left) + countNodes(right)\n</source>\n\n==Timeline of language support==\n\n===1960s===\nIn [[ALGOL 68]], tagged unions are called ''united modes'', the tag is implicit, and the <code>'''case'''</code> construct is used to determine which field is tagged:\n\n<code>'''mode''' '''node''' = '''union''' ('''real''', '''int''', '''compl''', '''string''');</code>\n\nUsage example for <code>'''union'''</code> <code>'''case'''</code> of <code>'''node'''</code>:\n\n '''node''' n := \"1234\";\n &nbsp;\n '''case''' n '''in'''\n   ('''real''' r):   print((\"real:\", r)),\n   ('''int''' i):    print((\"int:\", i)),\n   ('''compl''' c):  print((\"compl:\", c)),\n   ('''string''' s): print((\"string:\", s))\n   '''out'''         print((\"?:\", n))\n '''esac'''\n\n===1970s & 1980s===\nAlthough primarily only [[functional programming language|functional languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (from 1990s) give a central role to tagged unions and have the power to check that all cases are handled, other languages have support for tagged unions as well. However, in practice they can be less efficient in non-functional languages due to optimizations enabled by functional language compilers that can eliminate explicit tag checks and [[Type erasure|avoid explicit storage of tags]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[Ada programming language|Ada]], and [[Modula-2]] call them '''variant records''' (formally '''discriminated type''' in Ada), and require the tag field to be manually created and the tag values specified, as in this Pascal example:\n\n<source lang=\"pascal\">\ntype shapeKind = (square, rectangle, circle);\n     shape = record\n                centerx : integer;\n                centery : integer;\n                case kind : shapeKind of\n                   square : (side : integer);\n                   rectangle : (length, height : integer);\n                   circle : (radius : integer);\n\t      end;\n</source>\n\nand this Ada equivalent:\n<source lang=\"ada\">\ntype Shape_Kind is (Square, Rectangle, Circle);\ntype Shape (Kind : Shape_Kind) is record\n   Center_X : Integer;\n   Center_Y : Integer;\n   case Kind is\n      when Square =>\n         Side : Integer;\n      when Rectangle =>\n         Length, Height : Integer;\n      when Circle =>\n         Radius : Integer;\n   end case;\nend record;\n\n-- Any attempt to access a member whose existence depends\n-- on a particular value of the discriminant, while the\n-- discriminant is not the expected one, raises an error.\n</source>\n\nIn [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], a tagged union can be created from untagged unions using a strict access discipline where the tag is always checked:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nenum ShapeKind { Square, Rectangle, Circle };\n\nstruct Shape {\n    int centerx;\n    int centery;\n    enum ShapeKind kind;\n    union {\n        struct { int side; };           /* Square */\n        struct { int length, height; }; /* Rectangle */\n        struct { int radius; };         /* Circle */\n    };\n};\n\nint getSquareSide(struct Shape* s) {\n    assert(s->kind == Square);\n    return s->side;\n}\n\nvoid setSquareSide(struct Shape* s, int side) {\n    s->kind = Square;\n    s->side = side;\n}\n\n/* and so on */\n</source>\n\nAs long as the union fields are only accessed through the functions, the accesses will be safe and correct. The same approach can be used for encoded tags; we simply decode the tag and then check it on each access. If the inefficiency of these tag checks is a concern, they may be automatically removed in the final version.\n\nC and C++ also have language support for one particular tagged union: the possibly-null [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]. This may be compared to the <code>option</code> type in ML or the <code>Maybe</code> type in Haskell, and can be seen as a [[tagged pointer]]: a tagged union (with an encoded tag) of two types:\n* Valid pointers,\n* A [[null pointer]] type with only one value, <code>null</code>, indicating an exceptional condition.\nUnfortunately, C compilers do not verify that the null case is always handled, and this is a particularly prevalent source of errors in C code, since there is a tendency to ignore exceptional cases.\n\n===2000s===\nOne advanced dialect of C called [[Cyclone programming language|Cyclone]] has extensive built-in support for tagged unions.<ref>http://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Tagged%20Unions</ref>\n\nThe enum types in the [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Haxe (programming language)|Haxe]] and [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] languages also work as tagged unions.\n\nThe variant library from [[Boost C++ Libraries|Boost]] has demonstrated it was possible to implement a safe tagged union as a library in C++, visitable using function objects.\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\nstruct display : boost::static_visitor<void>\n{\n    void operator()(int i)\n    {\n        std::cout << \"It's an int, with value \" << i << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    void operator()(const std::string& s)\n    {\n        std::cout << \"It's a string, with value \" << s << std::endl;\n    }\n};\n\nboost::variant<int, std::string> v = 42;\nboost::apply_visitor(display(), v);\n\nboost::variant<int, std::string> v = \"hello world\";\nboost::apply_visitor(display(), v);\n</source>\n\n[[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] has case classes:\n<source lang=\"scala\">\nsealed abstract class Tree\ncase object Leaf extends Tree\ncase class Node(value: Int, left: Tree, right: Tree) extends Tree\n\nval tree = Node(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))\n</source>\n\nBecause the class hierarchy is sealed, the compiler can check that all cases are handled in a pattern match:\n<source lang=\"scala\">\ntree match {\n  case Node(x, _, _) => println(\"top level node value: \" + x)\n  case Leaf          => println(\"top level node is a leaf\")\n}\n</source>\n\nScala's case classes also permit reuse through subtyping:\n\n<source lang=\"scala\">\nsealed abstract class Shape(centerX: Int, centerY: Int)\ncase class Square(side: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)\ncase class Rectangle(length: Int, height: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)\ncase class Circle(radius: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)\n</source>\n\n[[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]] has discriminated unions:\n\n<source lang=\"fsharp\">\ntype Tree =\n  | Leaf\n  | Node of value: int * left: Tree * right: Tree\n\nlet tree = Node(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))\n</source>\n\nBecause the defined cases are exhaustive, the compiler can check that all cases are handled in a pattern match:\n<source lang=\"fsharp\">\nmatch tree with\n| Node (x, _, _) -> printfn \"top level node value: %i\" x\n| Leaf           -> printfn \"top level node is a leaf\"\n</source>\n\n[[Haxe]]'s enums also work as tagged unions<ref>{{cite web|title=Using Enums -
