Others, known as ''tunnelers'', bury the dung wherever they find it. A third group, the ''dwellers'', neither roll nor burrow: they simply live in manure. They are often attracted by the dung collected by [[burrowing owl]]s. There are dung beetle species of different colours and sizes, and some functional traits such as body mass (or biomass) and leg length can have high levels of variability.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=Hannah M.|last2=Louzada|first2=Julio|last3=Bardgett|first3=Richard D.|last4=Barlow|first4=Jos|date=2016-03-03|title=Assessing the Importance of Intraspecific Variability in Dung Beetle Functional Traits|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e0145598|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0145598|pmid=26939121|pmc=4777568|issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1145598G}}</ref>\n\nAll the [[species]] belong to the superfamily [[Scarabaeoidea]], most of them to the subfamilies [[Scarabaeinae]] and [[Aphodiinae]] of the family [[Scarabaeidae]] (scarab beetles).

Some smaller species simply attach themselves to the dung-providers to wait for the dung. After capturing the dung, a dung beetle rolls it, following a straight line despite all obstacles. Sometimes, dung beetles try to steal the dung ball from another beetle, so the dung beetles have to move rapidly away from a dung pile once they have rolled their ball to prevent it from being stolen. Dung beetles can roll up to 10 times their weight. Male ''Onthophagus taurus'' beetles can pull 1,141 times their own body weight: the equivalent of an average person pulling six double-decker buses full of people.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/24/dung-beetles | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Homa | last=Khaleeli | title=Just how strong is a dung beetle? | date=24 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Scarabaeus laticollis 2.jpg|thumb|left|Two dung beetles fighting over a ball of dung]]\n\nA species of dung beetle (the African ''Scarabaeus zambesianus'') [[animal navigation|navigates]] by [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] patterns in [[moonlight]],{{Sfn|Tills|2013|p=123}}  the first animal known to do so.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/424033a| pmid = 12840748| title = Animal behaviour: Insect orientation to polarized moonlight| journal = Nature| volume = 424| issue = 6944| page = 33| year = 2003| last1 = Dacke | first1 = M. | last2 = Nilsson | first2 = D.

The \"rollers\" roll and bury a dung ball either for food storage or for making a brooding ball. In the latter case, two beetles, one male and one female, stay around the dung ball during the rolling process. Usually it is the male that rolls the ball, while the female hitch-hikes or simply follows behind. In some cases, the male and the female roll together. When a spot with soft soil is found, they stop and bury the  ball, then [[mating|mate]] underground. After the mating, one or both of them prepares the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of [[mass provisioning]].\n\nSome species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring. The dung beetle goes through a complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The larvae live in brood balls made with dung prepared by their parents. During the larval stage, the beetle feeds on the dung surrounding it.\n\nThe behavior of the beetles was poorly understood until the studies of [[Jean Henri Fabre]] in the late 19th century. For example, Fabre corrected the myth that a dung beetle would seek aid from other dung beetles when confronted by obstacles. By observation and experiment, he found the seeming helpers were in fact awaiting an opportunity to steal the roller's food source.<ref>{{cite book |author=Fabre, J.

The derivative term ''xprw'' or ''\u1e2bpr(w)'' is variously translated as \"form\", \"transformation\", \"happening\", \"mode of being\" or \"what has come into being\", depending on the context. It may have existential, fictional, or ontologic significance.\n\nThe scarab was linked to [[Khepri]] (\"he who has come into being\"), the god of the rising [[sun]]. The ancients believed that the dung beetle was only male in gender, and reproduced by depositing [[semen]] into a dung ball. The supposed self-creation of the beetle resembles that of Khepri, who creates himself out of nothing. Moreover, the dung ball rolled by a dung beetle resembles the sun. [[Plutarch]] wrote: {{quote|The race of beetles has no female, but all the males eject their sperm into a round pellet of material which they roll up by pushing it from the opposite side, just as the sun seems to turn the heavens in the direction opposite to its own course, which is from west to east.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/E.html#ref373 \"Isis and Osiris\"], ''Moralia'', in volume V of the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition, 1936, now in the public domain. Retrieved on 2007-08-02.</ref>}}\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. Some [[New Kingdom]] royal tombs exhibit a threefold image of the sun god, with the beetle as symbol of the morning sun. The astronomical ceiling in the tomb of [[Ramses VI]] portrays the nightly \"death\" and \"rebirth\" of the sun as being swallowed by [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], goddess of the sky, and re-emerging from her womb as Khepri.\n\nThe image of the scarab, conveying ideas of transformation, renewal, and resurrection, is ubiquitous in ancient Egyptian religious and [[funerary art]].\n\nExcavations of ancient Egyptian sites have yielded images of the scarab in bone, [[ivory]], stone, [[Egyptian faience]], and precious metals, dating from the Sixth Dynasty and up to the period of Roman rule. They are generally small, bored to allow stringing on a necklace, and the base bears a brief inscription or [[cartouche]]. Some have been used as [[Impression seal|seals]]. [[Pharaoh]]s sometimes commissioned the manufacture of larger images with lengthy inscriptions, such as the [[The lion hunts of Amenhotep III during the first ten years of his reign|commemorative scarab]] of Queen [[Tiye]]. Massive sculptures of scarabs can be seen at [[Luxor Temple]], at the Serapeum in Alexandria (see [[Serapis]]) and elsewhere in Egypt.\n\n[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|left|A scarab, depicted on the walls of [[KV6|Tomb KV6]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]]]]\n\nThe scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. Scarabs, generally, though not always, were cut from green stone, and placed on the chest of the deceased. Perhaps the most famous example of such \"heart scarabs\" is the yellow-green [[pectoral (Ancient Egypt)|pectoral]] scarab found among the entombed provisions of [[Tutankhamen]]. It was carved from a large piece of [[Libyan desert glass]]. The purpose of the \"heart scarab\" was to ensure that the heart would not bear witness against the deceased at judgement in the Afterlife. Other possibilities are suggested by the \"transformation spells\" of the ''Coffin Texts'', which affirm that the soul of the deceased may transform (''xpr'') into a human being, a god, or a bird and reappear in the world of the living.\n\nOne scholar comments on other traits of the scarab connected with the theme of death and rebirth:\n{{quote|It may not have gone unnoticed that the pupa, whose wings and legs are encased at this stage of development, is very mummy-like. It has even been pointed out that the egg-bearing ball of dung is created in an underground chamber which is reached by a vertical shaft and horizontal passage curiously reminiscent of Old Kingdom mastaba tombs.\"<ref>Andrews, Carol (1994). ''Amulets of Ancient Egypt''. Texas: University of Texas Press. {{ISBN|0-292-70464-X}}. p. 51.</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast to funerary contexts, some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for [[scaraboid seal|seals]] of varying types. The best-known of these being Judean [[LMLK seal]]s (8 of 21 designs contained scarab beetles), which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of [[Hezekiah]].\n\nThe scarab remains an item of popular interest thanks to modern fascination with the art and beliefs of ancient Egypt. Scarab beads in semiprecious stones or glazed ceramics can be purchased at most bead shops, while at Luxor Temple a massive ancient scarab has been roped off to discourage visitors from rubbing the base of the statue \"for luck\".\n\n==In culture==\nSome dung beetles are used as food in South East Asia and a variety of dung beetle species have been used [[therapeutically]] (and are still being used in traditionally living societies) in potions and folk medicines to treat a number of illnesses and disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meyer-Rochow | first=V.B. |title=Therapeutic arthropods and other, largely terrestrial, folk-medicinally important invertebrates: a comparative survey and review. |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine| date=January 2017| volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=9| doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0136-0| pmid=28173820 | pmc=5296966 }}</ref>\n\n===In literature===\nIn [[Aesop's fable]] \"[[The Eagle and the Beetle]]\", the eagle kills a hare that has asked for sanctuary with a beetle. The beetle then takes revenge by twice destroying the eagle's eggs. The eagle, in despair, flies up to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] and places her latest eggs in [[Zeus]]'s lap, beseeching the god to protect them. When the beetle finds out what the eagle has done, it stuffs itself with dung, goes straight up to Zeus and flies right into his face. Zeus is startled at the sight of the unpleasant creature, jumping to his feet so that the eggs are broken. Learning of the origin of their feud, Zeus attempts to mediate and, when his efforts to mediate fail, he changes the breeding season of the eagle to a time when the beetles are not above ground.\n\n[[Aristophanes]] alluded to Aesop's fable several times in his plays. In ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'', the hero rides up to Olympus to free the goddess Peace from her prison. His steed is an enormous dung beetle which has been fed so much dung that it has grown to monstrous size.\n\n[[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s \"The Dung Beetle\" tells the story of a dung beetle who lives in the stable of the king's horses in an imaginary kingdom. When he demands golden shoes like those the king's horse wears and is refused, he flies away and has a series of adventures, which are often precipitated by his [[Superiority complex|feeling of superiority]] to other animals.

The \"rollers\" roll and bury a dung ball either for food storage or for making a brooding ball. In the latter case, two beetles, one male and one female, stay around the dung ball during the rolling process. Usually it is the male that rolls the ball, while the female hitch-hikes or simply follows behind. In some cases, the male and the female roll together. When a spot with soft soil is found, they stop and bury the  ball, then [[mating|mate]] underground. After the mating, one or both of them prepares the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of [[mass provisioning]].\n\nSome species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring. The dung beetle goes through a complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The larvae live in brood balls made with dung prepared by their parents. During the larval stage, the beetle feeds on the dung surrounding it.\n\nThe behavior of the beetles was poorly understood until the studies of [[Jean Henri Fabre]] in the late 19th century. For example, Fabre corrected the myth that a dung beetle would seek aid from other dung beetles when confronted by obstacles. By observation and experiment, he found the seeming helpers were in fact awaiting an opportunity to steal the roller's food source.<ref>{{cite book |author=Fabre, J.

The derivative term ''xprw'' or ''\u1e2bpr(w)'' is variously translated as \"form\", \"transformation\", \"happening\", \"mode of being\" or \"what has come into being\", depending on the context. It may have existential, fictional, or ontologic significance.\n\nThe scarab was linked to [[Khepri]] (\"he who has come into being\"), the god of the rising [[sun]]. The ancients believed that the dung beetle was only male in gender, and reproduced by depositing [[semen]] into a dung ball. The supposed self-creation of the beetle resembles that of Khepri, who creates himself out of nothing. Moreover, the dung ball rolled by a dung beetle resembles the sun. [[Plutarch]] wrote: {{quote|The race of beetles has no female, but all the males eject their sperm into a round pellet of material which they roll up by pushing it from the opposite side, just as the sun seems to turn the heavens in the direction opposite to its own course, which is from west to east.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/E.html#ref373 \"Isis and Osiris\"], ''Moralia'', in volume V of the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition, 1936, now in the public domain. Retrieved on 2007-08-02.</ref>}}\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. Some [[New Kingdom]] royal tombs exhibit a threefold image of the sun god, with the beetle as symbol of the morning sun. The astronomical ceiling in the tomb of [[Ramses VI]] portrays the nightly \"death\" and \"rebirth\" of the sun as being swallowed by [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], goddess of the sky, and re-emerging from her womb as Khepri.\n\nThe image of the scarab, conveying ideas of transformation, renewal, and resurrection, is ubiquitous in ancient Egyptian religious and [[funerary art]].\n\nExcavations of ancient Egyptian sites have yielded images of the scarab in bone, [[ivory]], stone, [[Egyptian faience]], and precious metals, dating from the Sixth Dynasty and up to the period of Roman rule. They are generally small, bored to allow stringing on a necklace, and the base bears a brief inscription or [[cartouche]]. Some have been used as [[Impression seal|seals]]. [[Pharaoh]]s sometimes commissioned the manufacture of larger images with lengthy inscriptions, such as the [[The lion hunts of Amenhotep III during the first ten years of his reign|commemorative scarab]] of Queen [[Tiye]]. Massive sculptures of scarabs can be seen at [[Luxor Temple]], at the Serapeum in Alexandria (see [[Serapis]]) and elsewhere in Egypt.\n\n[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|left|A scarab, depicted on the walls of [[KV6|Tomb KV6]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]]]]\n\nThe scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. Scarabs, generally, though not always, were cut from green stone, and placed on the chest of the deceased. Perhaps the most famous example of such \"heart scarabs\" is the yellow-green [[pectoral (Ancient Egypt)|pectoral]] scarab found among the entombed provisions of [[Tutankhamen]]. It was carved from a large piece of [[Libyan desert glass]]. The purpose of the \"heart scarab\" was to ensure that the heart would not bear witness against the deceased at judgement in the Afterlife. Other possibilities are suggested by the \"transformation spells\" of the ''Coffin Texts'', which affirm that the soul of the deceased may transform (''xpr'') into a human being, a god, or a bird and reappear in the world of the living.\n\nOne scholar comments on other traits of the scarab connected with the theme of death and rebirth:\n{{quote|It may not have gone unnoticed that the pupa, whose wings and legs are encased at this stage of development, is very mummy-like. It has even been pointed out that the egg-bearing ball of dung is created in an underground chamber which is reached by a vertical shaft and horizontal passage curiously reminiscent of Old Kingdom mastaba tombs.\"<ref>Andrews, Carol (1994). ''Amulets of Ancient Egypt''. Texas: University of Texas Press. {{ISBN|0-292-70464-X}}. p. 51.</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast to funerary contexts, some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for [[scaraboid seal|seals]] of varying types. The best-known of these being Judean [[LMLK seal]]s (8 of 21 designs contained scarab beetles), which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of [[Hezekiah]].\n\nThe scarab remains an item of popular interest thanks to modern fascination with the art and beliefs of ancient Egypt. Scarab beads in semiprecious stones or glazed ceramics can be purchased at most bead shops, while at Luxor Temple a massive ancient scarab has been roped off to discourage visitors from rubbing the base of the statue \"for luck\".\n\n==In culture==\nSome dung beetles are used as food in South East Asia and a variety of dung beetle species have been used [[therapeutically]] (and are still being used in traditionally living societies) in potions and folk medicines to treat a number of illnesses and disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meyer-Rochow | first=V.B. |title=Therapeutic arthropods and other, largely terrestrial, folk-medicinally important invertebrates: a comparative survey and review. |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine| date=January 2017| volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=9| doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0136-0| pmid=28173820 | pmc=5296966 }}</ref>\n\n===In literature===\nIn [[Aesop's fable]] \"[[The Eagle and the Beetle]]\", the eagle kills a hare that has asked for sanctuary with a beetle. The beetle then takes revenge by twice destroying the eagle's eggs. The eagle, in despair, flies up to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] and places her latest eggs in [[Zeus]]'s lap, beseeching the god to protect them. When the beetle finds out what the eagle has done, it stuffs itself with dung, goes straight up to Zeus and flies right into his face. Zeus is startled at the sight of the unpleasant creature, jumping to his feet so that the eggs are broken. Learning of the origin of their feud, Zeus attempts to mediate and, when his efforts to mediate fail, he changes the breeding season of the eagle to a time when the beetles are not above ground.\n\n[[Aristophanes]] alluded to Aesop's fable several times in his plays. In ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'', the hero rides up to Olympus to free the goddess Peace from her prison. His steed is an enormous dung beetle which has been fed so much dung that it has grown to monstrous size.\n\n[[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s \"The Dung Beetle\" tells the story of a dung beetle who lives in the stable of the king's horses in an imaginary kingdom. When he demands golden shoes like those the king's horse wears and is refused, he flies away and has a series of adventures, which are often precipitated by his [[Superiority complex|feeling of superiority]] to other animals. He finally returns to the stable having decided (against all logic) that it is for him that the king's horse wears golden shoes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andersen|first1=Hans Christian|last2=James|first2=M.

Based in [[Clearfield, Utah|Clearfield]], [[Utah]], the company was the successor to [[Arrow Development]] (1946\u20131981) and Arrow Huss (1981\u20131986), which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries. Among the most significant was tubular steel track, which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on [[wooden roller coaster]]s. The [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]] at [[Disneyland]], built in 1959, was Arrow's first roller coaster project.\n\nIn 1975, Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track [[Corkscrew (Silverwood)|Corkscrew]], at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] that sent riders through a series of corkscrews. Arrow created several other \"firsts\" over the years, introducing the first [[suspended roller coaster]] in almost a century, [[The Bat (Kings Island; opened 1981)|The Bat]], in 1981, and the world's first \"[[hypercoaster]]\", [[Magnum XL-200]], which opened in 1989. They built the first [[4th Dimension roller coaster]], [[X2 (roller coaster)|X2]], which was designed by [[Alan Schilke]] in 2002.\n\nArrow Development's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s. Arrow Dynamics would eventually survive two bankruptcies and spin off a sister company, Fabriweld, primarily to build track,<ref>19 December 1988 Kokomo Tribune, pg. 11; \"Coaster Rolling Toward Finish\"</ref> by 1988. Arrow Dynamics eventually closed on December 3, 2001. [[S&S Worldwide]] purchased part of Arrow's remaining assets on October 28, 2002, and the remainder of the company was dissolved. In 2012, [[Sansei Yusoki Co.|Sansei Yusoki Co]]. of Osaka, Japan, acquired a 77.3% interest in S&S - Arrow.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Beginnings===\nArrow Dynamic's forerunner, [[Arrow Development]], was founded in 1946 when Ed Morgan, Karl Bacon, Bill Hardiman, and Angus \"Andy\" Anderson, started a machine shop in [[Mountain View, California]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Perry|first=Nick|title=Arrow Development- A forgotten piece of Mountain View's past|url=http://www.mv-voice.com/morgue/2002/2002_07_26.history726.html|accessdate=January 9, 2014|newspaper=Mountain View Voice|date=July 26, 2002}}</ref> They started out selling used machine tools, building truck parts and repairing cars until about 1950 when they built their first [[carousel|merry-go-rounds]] for San Jose's Alum Rock Park.<ref name=\"Pioneers share Living Legend Award\"/>\n\nIn 1953, they contacted [[Walt Disney]], who was just beginning to plan a new type of amusement park in California.<ref name=Gurr/> Disney hired the company to help design and build the vehicles for [[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride]]. They would eventually design and build the ride systems for many of [[Disneyland]]'s original and early rides, including [[Mad Tea Party]], [[King Arthur Carrousel]], [[Casey Jr. Circus Train]], and [[Snow White's Scary Adventures]].<ref name=\"Pioneers share Living Legend Award\"/> Disney continued to use Arrow as Disneyland expanded. Arrow designed and built [[Dumbo the Flying Elephant (ride)|Dumbo the Flying Elephant]], [[Autopia]], and [[Alice in Wonderland (Disneyland attraction)|Alice in Wonderland]] in coming years as well as upgrading and renovating the [[King Arthur Carrousel]].<ref name=Gurr />\n\n===Roller coaster manufacturing===\n[[Image:MatterhornBobsled77 crwb.jpg|thumb|right|Matterhorn Bobsleds, the first Arrow Development roller coaster.]]\nIn 1959, Arrow Development designed what was to be their first of many roller coasters, the [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]] at [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[California]]. Built in conjunction with [[Walt Disney Imagineering|WED Imagineering]],<ref name=arrowdyn/> the ride was the first modern [[steel roller coaster|tubular steel tracked roller coaster]].\n\nAfter construction of the Matterhorn, Disney bought a third of Arrow Development in an effort to keep them viable and at least partially in-house. Arrow had already developed rides for other customers, and had orders for more, so they moved into a larger plant in Mountain View. At the new location, Arrow developed vehicles, flumes and tracks for [[It's a Small World]], [[Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]], [[Adventure Thru Inner Space]], and the [[Haunted Mansion]].\n\nArrow developed the modern [[Log flume (attraction)|log flume ride]], eventually installing over 50 around the world, beginning with [[El Aserradero]] at [[Six Flags Over Texas]] in 1963. In the 1970s, the company perfected and brought back the looping roller coaster.\n\nIn 1975, Arrow installed one of the most important rides of its time, [[Corkscrew (Silverwood)|Corkscrew]], which made its debut at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] as the world's first modern inverting coaster. Arrow made hundreds of coasters throughout the decades, including 17 Corkscrew-style coasters, 16 \"runaway mine train\" coasters like [[Cedar Creek Mine Ride]] and [[Adventure Express]], custom-designed coasters like [[Loch Ness Monster (roller coaster)|Loch Ness Monster]], and [[Carolina Cyclone]].\n\nSome of Arrow Development's later projects included what were at the time the world's tallest roller coasters, such as [[Magnum XL-200]] at [[Cedar Point]] in 1989, and [[Pepsi Max Big One]] at [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach]] in 1994.\n\n===Reorganizations and bankruptcy===\n[[Image:Arrow Huss Logo.jpg|frame|right|Arrow Huss logo (1981\u20131985)]]\nIn 1971, Karl Bacon, Ed Morgan and Walter Schulze sold Arrow Development to [[Rio Grande Industries]]. At the time, [[Penn Central]] owned [[Six Flags]] and Rio Grande had plans to build theme parks of their own, purchasing [[Frontier Village]] in 1973.<ref name=OBrien2006/>{{rp|224}} In the late 1970s, Arrow began teaching [[Vekoma]] how to build tubular track in their native Holland, and in return Vekoma became Arrow's European distributor. Rio Grande sold Arrow to the German manufacturing firm [[Huss Maschinenfabrik]] in 1981. The merger formed Arrow Huss. Dana Morgan, the son of Ed Morgan, was appointed the company's president, and [[Ron Toomer]] was made vice president and manager of engineering. Dana would leave the company and form [[Morgan Manufacturing]] in 1983. Although Arrow's coasters continued to sell well, Arrow Huss struggled financially, partially due to heavily investing in the [[Darien Lake]] theme park in New York, and the [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition]] in New Orleans.<ref name=OBrien2006/>{{rp|225}} Arrow Huss filed for bankruptcy in 1985, and 13 of the company's American officers negotiated a buyout. In 1986, the takeover was approved by the courts and the company re-emerged as Arrow Dynamics. Toomer served as president until 1993, Chairman of the Board until 1995, and as a consulting director until his retirement in 1998.<ref name=ToomerObit/>\n\nIn the late 1990s, Arrow Dynamic's bookings steadily decreased, with few installations toward the end of the decade. Despite attempts to keep up by implementing more updated design techniques, Arrow still found itself struggling to compete. Other manufacturers such as [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] and [[Intamin]] began to dominate the industry.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Seifert | first1 = Jeffrey | year = 2006 | title = Arrow | journal = RollerCoaster!

Bankruptcy loomed once again just as Arrow introduced the [[X2 (roller coaster)|X]] (subsequently known as X<sup>2</sup>) at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]], a [[4th dimension roller coaster]] designed by [[Alan Schilke]]. X opened to massive media attention and received an initially positive reception;{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} however, several mechanical problems caused the ride to be closed for repairs during much of its first year of operation.\n\nThe company filed for bankruptcy again on December 3, 2001. At the end of October 2002, the remaining assets were sold to  [[S&S Worldwide]], a [[limited liability company]] related to amusement ride manufacturer, forming [[S&S Arrow]].<ref name=\"S&S moves to

Dynamics logo (1986\u20132000)]]\n\n'''Arrow Dynamics''' was an American manufacturing and engineering company that specialized in designing and building amusement park rides, especially [[roller coaster]]<nowiki/>s. Based in [[Clearfield, Utah|Clearfield]], [[Utah]], the company was the successor to [[Arrow Development]] (1946\u20131981) and Arrow Huss (1981\u20131986), which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries. Among the most significant was tubular steel track, which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on [[wooden roller coaster]]s. The [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]] at [[Disneyland]], built in 1959, was Arrow's first roller coaster project.\n\nIn 1975, Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track [[Corkscrew (Silverwood)|Corkscrew]], at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] that sent riders through a series of corkscrews. Arrow created several other \"firsts\" over the years, introducing the first [[suspended roller coaster]] in almost a century, [[The Bat (Kings Island; opened 1981)|The Bat]], in 1981, and the world's first \"[[hypercoaster]]\", [[Magnum XL-200]], which opened in 1989. They built the first [[4th Dimension roller coaster]], [[X2 (roller coaster)|X2]], which was designed by [[Alan Schilke]] in 2002.\n\nArrow Development's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s. Arrow Dynamics would eventually survive two bankruptcies and spin off a sister company, Fabriweld, primarily to build track,<ref>19 December 1988 Kokomo Tribune, pg. 11; \"Coaster Rolling Toward Finish\"</ref> by 1988. Arrow Dynamics eventually closed on December 3, 2001. [[S&S Worldwide]] purchased part of Arrow's remaining assets on October 28, 2002, and the remainder of the company was dissolved. In 2012, [[Sansei Yusoki Co.|Sansei Yusoki Co]]. of Osaka, Japan, acquired a 77.3% interest in S&S - Arrow.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Beginnings===\nArrow Dynamic's forerunner, [[Arrow Development]], was founded in 1946 when Ed Morgan, Karl Bacon, Bill Hardiman, and Angus \"Andy\" Anderson, started a machine shop in [[Mountain View, California]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Perry|first=Nick|title=Arrow Development- A forgotten piece of Mountain View's past|url=http://www.mv-voice.com/morgue/2002/2002_07_26.history726.html|accessdate=January 9, 2014|newspaper=Mountain View Voice|date=July 26, 2002}}</ref> They started out selling used machine tools, building truck parts and repairing cars until about 1950 when they built their first [[carousel|merry-go-rounds]] for San Jose's Alum Rock Park.<ref name=\"Pioneers share Living Legend Award\"/>\n\nIn 1953, they contacted [[Walt Disney]], who was just beginning to plan a new type of amusement park in California.<ref name=Gurr/> Disney hired the company to help design and build the vehicles for [[Mr. Toad's Wild Ride]]. They would eventually design and build the ride systems for many of [[Disneyland]]'s original and early rides, including [[Mad Tea Party]], [[King Arthur Carrousel]], [[Casey Jr. Circus Train]], and [[Snow White's Scary Adventures]].<ref name=\"Pioneers share Living Legend Award\"/> Disney continued to use Arrow as Disneyland expanded. Arrow designed and built [[Dumbo the Flying Elephant (ride)|Dumbo the Flying Elephant]], [[Autopia]], and [[Alice in Wonderland (Disneyland attraction)|Alice in Wonderland]] in coming years as well as upgrading and renovating the [[King Arthur Carrousel]].<ref name=Gurr />\n\n===Roller coaster manufacturing===\n[[Image:MatterhornBobsled77 crwb.jpg|thumb|right|Matterhorn Bobsleds, the first Arrow Development roller coaster.]]\nIn 1959, Arrow Development designed what was to be their first of many roller coasters, the [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]] at [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[California]]. Built in conjunction with [[Walt Disney Imagineering|WED Imagineering]],<ref name=arrowdyn/> the ride was the first modern [[steel roller coaster|tubular steel tracked roller coaster]].\n\nAfter construction of the Matterhorn, Disney bought a third of Arrow Development in an effort to keep them viable and at least partially in-house. Arrow had already developed rides for other customers, and had orders for more, so they moved into a larger plant in Mountain View. At the new location, Arrow developed vehicles, flumes and tracks for [[It's a Small World]], [[Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]], [[Adventure Thru Inner Space]], and the [[Haunted Mansion]].\n\nArrow developed the modern [[Log flume (attraction)|log flume ride]], eventually installing over 50 around the world, beginning with [[El Aserradero]] at [[Six Flags Over Texas]] in 1963. In the 1970s, the company perfected and brought back the looping roller coaster.\n\nIn 1975, Arrow installed one of the most important rides of its time, [[Corkscrew (Silverwood)|Corkscrew]], which made its debut at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] as the world's first modern inverting coaster. Arrow made hundreds of coasters throughout the decades, including 17 Corkscrew-style coasters, 16 \"runaway mine train\" coasters like [[Cedar Creek Mine Ride]] and [[Adventure Express]], custom-designed coasters like [[Loch Ness Monster (roller coaster)|Loch Ness Monster]], and [[Carolina Cyclone]].\n\nSome of Arrow Development's later projects included what were at the time the world's tallest roller coasters, such as [[Magnum XL-200]] at [[Cedar Point]] in 1989, and [[Pepsi Max Big One]] at [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach]] in 1994.\n\n===Reorganizations and bankruptcy===\n[[Image:Arrow Huss Logo.jpg|frame|right|Arrow Huss logo (1981\u20131985)]]\nIn 1971, Karl Bacon, Ed Morgan and Walter Schulze sold Arrow Development to [[Rio Grande Industries]]. At the time, [[Penn Central]] owned [[Six Flags]] and Rio Grande had plans to build theme parks of their own, purchasing [[Frontier Village]] in 1973.<ref name=OBrien2006/>{{rp|224}} In the late 1970s, Arrow began teaching [[Vekoma]] how to build tubular track in their native Holland, and in return Vekoma became Arrow's European distributor. Rio Grande sold Arrow to the German manufacturing firm [[Huss Maschinenfabrik]] in 1981. The merger formed Arrow Huss. Dana Morgan, the son of Ed Morgan, was appointed the company's president, and [[Ron Toomer]] was made vice president and manager of engineering. Dana would leave the company and form [[Morgan Manufacturing]] in 1983. Although Arrow's coasters continued to sell well, Arrow Huss struggled financially, partially due to heavily investing in the [[Darien Lake]] theme park in New York, and the [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition]] in New Orleans.<ref name=OBrien2006/>{{rp|225}} Arrow Huss filed for bankruptcy in 1985, and 13 of the company's American officers negotiated a buyout. In 1986, the takeover was approved by the courts and the company re-emerged as Arrow Dynamics. Toomer served as president until 1993, Chairman of the Board until 1995, and as a consulting director until his retirement in 1998.<ref name=ToomerObit/>\n\nIn the late 1990s, Arrow Dynamic's bookings steadily decreased, with few installations toward the end of the decade. Despite attempts to keep up by implementing more updated design techniques, Arrow still found itself struggling to compete. Other manufacturers such as [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] and [[Intamin]] began to dominate the industry.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Seifert | first1 = Jeffrey | year = 2006 | title = Arrow | journal = RollerCoaster! Magazine | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 11\u201314 | issn = 0896-7261}}</ref>\n\nDesign and manufacturing costs for new, larger ride systems were increasing and competition grew. Bankruptcy loomed once again just as Arrow introduced the [[X2 (roller coaster)|X]] (subsequently known as X<sup>2</sup>) at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]], a [[4th dimension roller coaster]] designed by [[Alan Schilke]]. X opened to massive media attention and received an initially positive reception;{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} however, several mechanical problems caused the ride to be closed for repairs during much of its first year of operation.\n\nThe company filed for bankruptcy again on December 3, 2001. At the end of October 2002, the remaining assets were sold to  [[S&S Worldwide]], a [[limited liability company]] related to amusement ride manufacturer, forming [[S&S Arrow]].<ref name=\"S&S moves to

That has led to some debate over how real and how universal phonemes really are (see [[phoneme]] for details). Only some of the variation is significant, by being detectable or perceivable, to speakers.\n\nThere are two types of allophones, based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation or whether the speaker has the unconscious freedom to choose the allophone that is used.\n\nIf a specific allophone from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme must be selected in a given context, and using a different allophone for a phoneme would cause confusion or make the speaker sound non-native, the allophones are said to be ''complementary''. The allophones then complement each other, and one of them is not used in a situation in which the usage of another is standard. For complementary allophones, each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a [[phonology|phonological]] process.<ref name=\"ref47qoref\">{{Citation | title=English L2 reading: getting to the bottom | author=Barbara M. Birch | publisher=Psychology Press, 2002 | isbn=978-0-8058-3899-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kiHSOxn0zX4C | quote=''...When the occurrence of one allophone is predictable when compared to the other, as in this case, we call this complementary distribution. Complementary distribution means that the allophones are 'distributed' as complements....''}}</ref>\n\nIn other cases, the speaker can freely select from ''[[free variation|free variant]]'' allophones on personal habit or preference, but free variant allophones are still selected in the specific context, not the other way around.\n\nAnother example of an allophone is [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]], in which a phoneme is to sound more like another phoneme. One example of assimilation is [[consonant voicing and devoicing]], in which voiceless consonants are voiced before and after voiced consonants, and voiced consonants are devoiced before and after voiceless consonants.\n\n==Allotone==\nAn '''allotone''' is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonic]] allophone, such as the [[neutral tone]] in [[Standard Mandarin]].\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== English ===\n{{main|English phonology#Allophones of consonants|English phonology#Allophones of vowels}}\n \nThere are many allophonic processes in English: lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.\n\n* [[Aspirated consonant|Aspiration]]: In English, a voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} is aspirated (has a strong explosion of breath) if it is at the beginning of the first or a stressed syllable in a word. For example, {{IPA|[p\u02b0]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''spin'' are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} because they cannot distinguish words (in fact, they occur in [[complementary distribution]]). English-speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are different: the first is aspirated and the second is [[unaspirated]] (plain). Many languages [[Aspirated consonant#Usage patterns|treat the two phones differently]].\n* Nasal plosion \u2013 In English, a plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, \u0261/}}) has nasal plosion if it is followed by a nasal, whether within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Partial devoicing of [[sonorant]]s: In English, sonorants ({{IPA|/j, w, l, r, m, n, \u014b/}}) are partially devoiced after a voiceless sound in the same syllable.\n* Complete devoicing of sonorants: In English, a sonorant is completely devoiced after an aspirated plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k/}}).\n* Partial devoicing of [[obstruent]]s: In English, a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Retraction: In English, {{IPA|/t, d, n, l/}} are [[Retracted (phonetics)|retracted]] before {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\nBecause the choice among allophones is seldom under conscious control, few people realize their existence. English-speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}: unreleased {{IPA|[ t\u031a]}} as in ''cat'', aspirated {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} as in ''top'', glottalized {{IPA|[\u0294]}} as in ''button'', flapped {{IPA|[\u027e]}} as in [[American English]] ''water'', nasalized flapped {{IPA|[\u027e&#771;]}} as in ''winter'', and none of the above {{IPA|[t]}} as in ''stop''. However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:\n\n*''Night rate'': unreleased {{IPA|[\u02c8n\u028c\u026at\u031a.\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}} (without a [[word space]] between {{IPA|[ . ]}} and {{IPA|[\u0279]}})\n*''Nitrate'': aspirated {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u02b0\u0279\u0325e\u026at\u031a]}} or retracted {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u0320\u0279\u0320\u030a\u02d4\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}}\n\nA flame that is held before the lips while those words are spoken flickers more for the aspirated ''nitrate'' than for the unaspirated ''night rate.'' The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than for an English-speaker, who has learned since childhood to ignore the distinction.\n\nAllophones of English {{IPA|/l/}} may be noticed if the 'light' {{IPA|[l]}} of ''leaf'' {{IPA|[\u02c8li\u02d0f]}} is contrasted with the 'dark' {{IPA|[\u026b]}} of ''feel'' {{IPA|[\u02c8fi\u02d0\u026b]}}. Again, the difference is much more obvious to a [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/\u026b/}} are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.\n\nThese descriptions are more sequentially broken down in the next section.\n\n=== Rules for English Consonant Allophones ===\n\n[[Peter Ladefoged]], a renowned [[phonetics|phonetician]], clearly explains the [[consonant]] [[allophones]] of [[language|English]] in a precise list of statements to illustrate the language behavior. Some of these rules apply to all the consonants of English; the first item on the list deals with consonant length, items 2 through 18 apply to only selected groups of consonants, and the last item deals with the quality of a consonant. \nThese descriptive rules are as follows<ref>Ladefoged, Peter (2001). A Course in Phonetics (4th ed.). Orlando: Harcourt. {{ISBN|0-15-507319-2}}. p. 56-60.</ref>:\n# Consonants are longer when at the end of a phrase. This can be easily tested by recording a speaker saying a sound like \u201cbib\u201d, then comparing the forward and backward playback of the recording. One will find that the backward playback does not sound like the forward playback because the production of what is expected to be the same sound is not identical.\n# [[Voicelessness|Voiceless]] [[stop consonant|stops]] {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] when they come at the beginning of a syllable, such as in words like \"pip, test, kick\" {{IPA|[p<sup>h</sup>\u026ap, t<sup>h</sup>\u025bst, k<sup>h</sup>\u026ak]}}. You can compare this with voiceless stops that are not [[syllable]] initial like \"stop\" [st\u0251p]. The {{IPA|/t/}} voiceless stop follows the {{IPA|/s/}} (fricative) here.\n# [[voice (phonetics)|Voiced]] [[obstruents]], which include stops and [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], such as {{IPA|/b,d,g,v,\u00f0,z,\u0292/}}, that come at the end of an utterance like {{IPA|/v/}} in \"improve\" or before a voiceless sound like {{IPA|/d/}} in \"add two\") are only briefly voiced during the articulation.\n# Voiced stops and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} in fact occur as voiceless at the beginning of a syllable unless immediately preceded by a voiced sound, in which the voiced sound carries over.\n# [[Approximant consonant|Approximants]] (in English, these include {{IPA|/w,r,j,l/}}) are partially voiceless when they occur after syllable-initial {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} like in \"play, twin, cue\" {{IPA|[pl\u0325e\u026a, tw\u0325\u026an, kj\u0325u]}}.\n# Voiceless stops {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are not aspirated when following after a syllable initial fricative, such as in the words \"spew, stew, skew.\"\n# Voiceless stops and affricates {{IPA|/p,t,k,t\u0283/}} are longer than their voiced counterparts {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} when situated at the end of a syllable. Try comparing \"cap\" to \"cab\" or \"back\" to \"bag\".\n# When a stop comes before another stop, the explosion of air only follows after the second stop, illustrated in words like \"apt\" {{IPA|[\u00e6p\u031at]}} and \"rubbed\" {{IPA|[r\u028cb\u031ad]}}.\n# Many English accents produce a [[glottal stop]] in syllables that end with voiceless stops. Some examples include pronunciations of \"tip, pit, kick\" {{IPA|[t\u026a\u0294p, p\u026a\u0294t, k\u026a\u0294k]}}.\n# Some accents of English use a glottal stop in place of a {{IPA|/t/}} when it comes before an alveolar nasal in the same word (as opposed to in the next word), such as in the word \"beaten\" {{IPA|[\u02c8bi\u02d0\u0294n\u0329]}}.\n# Nasals become syllabic, or their own syllable, only when immediately following an obstruent (as opposed to just any consonant), such as in the words \"leaden, chasm\" {{IPA|[\u02c8l\u025bdn\u0329, \u02c8k\u00e6zm\u0329]}}. Take in comparison \"kiln, film\"; in most accents of English, the nasals are not syllabic.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}}, however, is syllabic at the end of the word when immediately following any consonant, like in \"paddle, whistle\" {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u00e6dl\u0329, \u02c8w\u026asl\u0329]}}. \n## When considering {{IPA|/r,l/}} as [[Liquid consonant|liquids]], {{IPA|/r/}} is included in this rule as well as present in the words \"sabre, razor, hammer, tailor\" {{IPA|[\u02c8se\u026ab\u0279\u0329, \u02c8re\u026az\u0279\u0329, \u02c8h\u00e6m\u0279\u0329, \u02c8te\u026al\u0279\u0329]}}.\n# [[voiceless dental and alveolar stops|Alveolar stops]] become [[Dental and alveolar taps and flaps|voiced taps]] when they occur between two vowels, as long as the second vowel is [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]]. Take for instance mainly American English pronunciations like \"fatty, data, daddy, many\" {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027e\u0259, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8m\u025b\u027e\u0303i]}}.\n## When an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar nasals|alveolar nasal]] is followed by a stop, the {{IPA|/t/}} is lost and a nasal tap occurs, causing \"winter\" to sound just like \"winner\" or \"panting\" to sound just like \"panning\". In this case, both alveolar stops and alveolar nasal plus stop sequences become voiced taps after two vowels when the second vowel is unstressed. This can vary among speakers, where the rule does not apply to certain words or when speaking at a slower pace.\n# All alveolar consonants assimilate to [[Dental consonant|dentals]] when occurring before a dental. Take the words \"eighth, tenth, wealth\". This also applies across word boundaries, for example \"at this\" {{IPA|[\u02c8\u00e6t\u032a \u00f0\u026as]]}}.\n# Alveolar stops are reduced or omitted when between two consonants. Some examples include \"most people\" (can be written either as {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028as \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028ast \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} with the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], where the {{IPA|[t]}} is inaudible, and \"sand paper, grand master\", where the {{IPA|[d]}} is inaudible.\n# A consonant is shortened when it is before an identical consonant, such as in \"big game\" or \"top post\".\n# A [[Homorganic consonant|homorganic]] voiceless stop may be inserted after a [[Nasal consonant|nasal]] before a voiceless fricative followed by an unstressed vowel in the same word. For example, a [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]] voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p/}} can be detected in the word \"something\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u028cmp\u03b8\u026a\u014b]}} even though it is orthographically not indicated. This is known as [[epenthesis]]. However, the following vowel must be unstressed.\n# Velar stops {{IPA|/k,g/}} become more [[Front and back|front]] when the following vowel sound in the same syllable becomes more front. Compare for instance \"cap\" {{IPA|[k\u00e6p]}} vs. \"key\" {{IPA|[k\u02b2i]}} and \"gap\" {{IPA|[g\u00e6p]}} vs. \"geese\" {{IPA|[g\u02b2i\u02d0s]}}.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}} is [[Velarization|velarized]] at the end of a word when it comes after a vowel as well as before a consonant.

Also the following has relevance here: [[Free variation]]. -->\n\n== Representing a phoneme with an allophone ==\nSince phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds, not the sounds themselves, they have no direct [[phonetic transcription]]. When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple [[broad transcription]] is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, the allophony becomes significant and things then become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, that representation is chosen for the phoneme.\n\nHowever, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than that allows. In such cases, a common convention is to use the \"elsewhere condition\" to decide the allophone that stands for the phoneme. The \"elsewhere\" allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules.\n\nFor example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only before a nasal consonant in the same syllable; elsewhere, they are oral. Therefore, by the \"elsewhere\" convention, the oral allophones are considered basic, and nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.\n\nIn other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the languages of the world than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory.\n\nAn alternative, which is commonly used for [[archiphoneme]]s, is to use a capital letter, such as /N/ for [m], [n], [\u014b].\n\nIn rare cases, a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as [[dingbat]]s, to avoid privileging any particular allophone.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hale |first1=Mark |title=Marshallese phonology, the phonetics-phonology interface and historical linguistics |journal=The Linguistic Review |date=2000 |volume=17 |issue=2-4 |page=241-258}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Allo-]]\n*[[Allophonic rule]]\n*[[Allomorph]]\n*[[Alternation (linguistics)]]\n*[[Diaphoneme]]\n*[[List of phonetics topics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110212012436/http://www.elloandfriends.uni-osnabrueck.de/wikis/1/show?n=PhoneticsandPhonology.PhonemesAndAllophones Phonemes and allophones]\n\n[[Category:Phonetics]]\n[[Category:Phonology]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Sounds considered the same in a language}}\n{{Use American English|date=February 2019}}\n{{for|the term for someone whose native language is not French or English, typically used in Canada|Allophone (Canada)}}\n[[File:Phoneme-allophone-determination-chart.svg|thumb|A simplified procedure to determine whether two sounds represent the same or different phonemes.

That has led to some debate over how real and how universal phonemes really are (see [[phoneme]] for details). Only some of the variation is significant, by being detectable or perceivable, to speakers.\n\nThere are two types of allophones, based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation or whether the speaker has the unconscious freedom to choose the allophone that is used.\n\nIf a specific allophone from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme must be selected in a given context, and using a different allophone for a phoneme would cause confusion or make the speaker sound non-native, the allophones are said to be ''complementary''. The allophones then complement each other, and one of them is not used in a situation in which the usage of another is standard. For complementary allophones, each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a [[phonology|phonological]] process.<ref name=\"ref47qoref\">{{Citation | title=English L2 reading: getting to the bottom | author=Barbara M.

Complementary distribution means that the allophones are 'distributed' as complements....''}}</ref>\n\nIn other cases, the speaker can freely select from ''[[free variation|free variant]]'' allophones on personal habit or preference, but free variant allophones are still selected in the specific context, not the other way around.\n\nAnother example of an allophone is [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]], in which a phoneme is to sound more like another phoneme. One example of assimilation is [[consonant voicing and devoicing]], in which voiceless consonants are voiced before and after voiced consonants, and voiced consonants are devoiced before and after voiceless consonants.\n\n==Allotone==\nAn '''allotone''' is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonic]] allophone, such as the [[neutral tone]] in [[Standard Mandarin]].\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== English ===\n{{main|English phonology#Allophones of consonants|English phonology#Allophones of vowels}}\n \nThere are many allophonic processes in English: lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.\n\n* [[Aspirated consonant|Aspiration]]: In English, a voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} is aspirated (has a strong explosion of breath) if it is at the beginning of the first or a stressed syllable in a word. For example, {{IPA|[p\u02b0]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''spin'' are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} because they cannot distinguish words (in fact, they occur in [[complementary distribution]]). English-speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are different: the first is aspirated and the second is [[unaspirated]] (plain). Many languages [[Aspirated consonant#Usage patterns|treat the two phones differently]].\n* Nasal plosion \u2013 In English, a plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, \u0261/}}) has nasal plosion if it is followed by a nasal, whether within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Partial devoicing of [[sonorant]]s: In English, sonorants ({{IPA|/j, w, l, r, m, n, \u014b/}}) are partially devoiced after a voiceless sound in the same syllable.\n* Complete devoicing of sonorants: In English, a sonorant is completely devoiced after an aspirated plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k/}}).\n* Partial devoicing of [[obstruent]]s: In English, a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Retraction: In English, {{IPA|/t, d, n, l/}} are [[Retracted (phonetics)|retracted]] before {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\nBecause the choice among allophones is seldom under conscious control, few people realize their existence. English-speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}: unreleased {{IPA|[ t\u031a]}} as in ''cat'', aspirated {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} as in ''top'', glottalized {{IPA|[\u0294]}} as in ''button'', flapped {{IPA|[\u027e]}} as in [[American English]] ''water'', nasalized flapped {{IPA|[\u027e&#771;]}} as in ''winter'', and none of the above {{IPA|[t]}} as in ''stop''. However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:\n\n*''Night rate'': unreleased {{IPA|[\u02c8n\u028c\u026at\u031a.\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}} (without a [[word space]] between {{IPA|[ . ]}} and {{IPA|[\u0279]}})\n*''Nitrate'': aspirated {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u02b0\u0279\u0325e\u026at\u031a]}} or retracted {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u0320\u0279\u0320\u030a\u02d4\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}}\n\nA flame that is held before the lips while those words are spoken flickers more for the aspirated ''nitrate'' than for the unaspirated ''night rate.'' The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than for an English-speaker, who has learned since childhood to ignore the distinction.\n\nAllophones of English {{IPA|/l/}} may be noticed if the 'light' {{IPA|[l]}} of ''leaf'' {{IPA|[\u02c8li\u02d0f]}} is contrasted with the 'dark' {{IPA|[\u026b]}} of ''feel'' {{IPA|[\u02c8fi\u02d0\u026b]}}. Again, the difference is much more obvious to a [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/\u026b/}} are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.\n\nThese descriptions are more sequentially broken down in the next section.\n\n=== Rules for English Consonant Allophones ===\n\n[[Peter Ladefoged]], a renowned [[phonetics|phonetician]], clearly explains the [[consonant]] [[allophones]] of [[language|English]] in a precise list of statements to illustrate the language behavior. Some of these rules apply to all the consonants of English; the first item on the list deals with consonant length, items 2 through 18 apply to only selected groups of consonants, and the last item deals with the quality of a consonant. \nThese descriptive rules are as follows<ref>Ladefoged, Peter (2001). A Course in Phonetics (4th ed.). Orlando: Harcourt. {{ISBN|0-15-507319-2}}. p. 56-60.</ref>:\n# Consonants are longer when at the end of a phrase. This can be easily tested by recording a speaker saying a sound like \u201cbib\u201d, then comparing the forward and backward playback of the recording. One will find that the backward playback does not sound like the forward playback because the production of what is expected to be the same sound is not identical.\n# [[Voicelessness|Voiceless]] [[stop consonant|stops]] {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] when they come at the beginning of a syllable, such as in words like \"pip, test, kick\" {{IPA|[p<sup>h</sup>\u026ap, t<sup>h</sup>\u025bst, k<sup>h</sup>\u026ak]}}. You can compare this with voiceless stops that are not [[syllable]] initial like \"stop\" [st\u0251p]. The {{IPA|/t/}} voiceless stop follows the {{IPA|/s/}} (fricative) here.\n# [[voice (phonetics)|Voiced]] [[obstruents]], which include stops and [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], such as {{IPA|/b,d,g,v,\u00f0,z,\u0292/}}, that come at the end of an utterance like {{IPA|/v/}} in \"improve\" or before a voiceless sound like {{IPA|/d/}} in \"add two\") are only briefly voiced during the articulation.\n# Voiced stops and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} in fact occur as voiceless at the beginning of a syllable unless immediately preceded by a voiced sound, in which the voiced sound carries over.\n# [[Approximant consonant|Approximants]] (in English, these include {{IPA|/w,r,j,l/}}) are partially voiceless when they occur after syllable-initial {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} like in \"play, twin, cue\" {{IPA|[pl\u0325e\u026a, tw\u0325\u026an, kj\u0325u]}}.\n# Voiceless stops {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are not aspirated when following after a syllable initial fricative, such as in the words \"spew, stew, skew.\"\n# Voiceless stops and affricates {{IPA|/p,t,k,t\u0283/}} are longer than their voiced counterparts {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} when situated at the end of a syllable. Try comparing \"cap\" to \"cab\" or \"back\" to \"bag\".\n# When a stop comes before another stop, the explosion of air only follows after the second stop, illustrated in words like \"apt\" {{IPA|[\u00e6p\u031at]}} and \"rubbed\" {{IPA|[r\u028cb\u031ad]}}.\n# Many English accents produce a [[glottal stop]] in syllables that end with voiceless stops. Some examples include pronunciations of \"tip, pit, kick\" {{IPA|[t\u026a\u0294p, p\u026a\u0294t, k\u026a\u0294k]}}.\n# Some accents of English use a glottal stop in place of a {{IPA|/t/}} when it comes before an alveolar nasal in the same word (as opposed to in the next word), such as in the word \"beaten\" {{IPA|[\u02c8bi\u02d0\u0294n\u0329]}}.\n# Nasals become syllabic, or their own syllable, only when immediately following an obstruent (as opposed to just any consonant), such as in the words \"leaden, chasm\" {{IPA|[\u02c8l\u025bdn\u0329, \u02c8k\u00e6zm\u0329]}}. Take in comparison \"kiln, film\"; in most accents of English, the nasals are not syllabic.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}}, however, is syllabic at the end of the word when immediately following any consonant, like in \"paddle, whistle\" {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u00e6dl\u0329, \u02c8w\u026asl\u0329]}}. \n## When considering {{IPA|/r,l/}} as [[Liquid consonant|liquids]], {{IPA|/r/}} is included in this rule as well as present in the words \"sabre, razor, hammer, tailor\" {{IPA|[\u02c8se\u026ab\u0279\u0329, \u02c8re\u026az\u0279\u0329, \u02c8h\u00e6m\u0279\u0329, \u02c8te\u026al\u0279\u0329]}}.\n# [[voiceless dental and alveolar stops|Alveolar stops]] become [[Dental and alveolar taps and flaps|voiced taps]] when they occur between two vowels, as long as the second vowel is [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]]. Take for instance mainly American English pronunciations like \"fatty, data, daddy, many\" {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027e\u0259, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8m\u025b\u027e\u0303i]}}.\n## When an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar nasals|alveolar nasal]] is followed by a stop, the {{IPA|/t/}} is lost and a nasal tap occurs, causing \"winter\" to sound just like \"winner\" or \"panting\" to sound just like \"panning\". In this case, both alveolar stops and alveolar nasal plus stop sequences become voiced taps after two vowels when the second vowel is unstressed. This can vary among speakers, where the rule does not apply to certain words or when speaking at a slower pace.\n# All alveolar consonants assimilate to [[Dental consonant|dentals]] when occurring before a dental. Take the words \"eighth, tenth, wealth\". This also applies across word boundaries, for example \"at this\" {{IPA|[\u02c8\u00e6t\u032a \u00f0\u026as]]}}.\n# Alveolar stops are reduced or omitted when between two consonants. Some examples include \"most people\" (can be written either as {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028as \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028ast \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} with the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], where the {{IPA|[t]}} is inaudible, and \"sand paper, grand master\", where the {{IPA|[d]}} is inaudible.\n# A consonant is shortened when it is before an identical consonant, such as in \"big game\" or \"top post\".\n# A [[Homorganic consonant|homorganic]] voiceless stop may be inserted after a [[Nasal consonant|nasal]] before a voiceless fricative followed by an unstressed vowel in the same word. For example, a [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]] voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p/}} can be detected in the word \"something\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u028cmp\u03b8\u026a\u014b]}} even though it is orthographically not indicated. This is known as [[epenthesis]]. However, the following vowel must be unstressed.\n# Velar stops {{IPA|/k,g/}} become more [[Front and back|front]] when the following vowel sound in the same syllable becomes more front. Compare for instance \"cap\" {{IPA|[k\u00e6p]}} vs. \"key\" {{IPA|[k\u02b2i]}} and \"gap\" {{IPA|[g\u00e6p]}} vs. \"geese\" {{IPA|[g\u02b2i\u02d0s]}}.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}} is [[Velarization|velarized]] at the end of a word when it comes after a vowel as well as before a consonant.

Not included yet: [[Quenya#Morphophonemics_and_allophony]], . Also the following has relevance here: [[Free variation]]. -->\n\n== Representing a phoneme with an allophone ==\nSince phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds, not the sounds themselves, they have no direct [[phonetic transcription]]. When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple [[broad transcription]] is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, the allophony becomes significant and things then become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, that representation is chosen for the phoneme.\n\nHowever, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than that allows. In such cases, a common convention is to use the \"elsewhere condition\" to decide the allophone that stands for the phoneme. The \"elsewhere\" allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules.\n\nFor example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only before a nasal consonant in the same syllable; elsewhere, they are oral. Therefore, by the \"elsewhere\" convention, the oral allophones are considered basic, and nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.\n\nIn other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the languages of the world than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory.\n\nAn alternative, which is commonly used for [[archiphoneme]]s, is to use a capital letter, such as /N/ for [m], [n], [\u014b].\n\nIn rare cases, a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as [[dingbat]]s, to avoid privileging any particular allophone.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hale |first1=Mark |title=Marshallese phonology, the phonetics-phonology interface and historical linguistics |journal=The Linguistic Review |date=2000 |volume=17 |issue=2-4 |page=241-258}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Allo-]]\n*[[Allophonic rule]]\n*[[Allomorph]]\n*[[Alternation (linguistics)]]\n*[[Diaphoneme]]\n*[[List of phonetics topics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110212012436/http://www.elloandfriends.uni-osnabrueck.de/wikis/1/show?n=PhoneticsandPhonology.PhonemesAndAllophones Phonemes and allophones]\n\n[[Category:Phonetics]]\n[[Category:Phonology]]\n", "name_user": "149.255.198.4", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone"}
