{"title_page": "History of Bucharest", "text_new": "[[Image:Historical Bucharest CoA 1868.jpg|thumb|200px|The 1868 [[coat of arms of Bucharest]] (logo reads 'The Homeland And My Right')]]\n\nThe '''history of Bucharest''' covers the time from the early settlements on the locality's territory (and that of the surrounding area in [[Ilfov County]]) until its modern existence as a city, capital of [[Wallachia]], and present-day capital of [[Romania]].\n\n==Ancient times==\n[[File:Sutu Museum Tei Culture.jpg|200px|thumb|Tei Culture artefacts]]\nIn [[ancient history|Antiquity]], much of the territory of [[Bucharest]] and Ilfov was covered by the thick forests of [[Codrii Vl\u0103siei]]. The forested area, especially the [[Colentina River|Colentina]] and [[D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a River|D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a]] valleys, were home to small, scattered settlements as early as the [[Paleolithic]]; during the [[Neolithic]], Bucharest saw the presence of the ''[[Glina culture]]'', and, before the 19th century BC, was included in areas of the ''[[Gumelni\u0163a culture]]''.<ref>Giurescu, p.25-26; Morintz and Rosetti, p.12-18</ref> During the [[Bronze Age]], a third phase of the ''Glina culture'' (centered on [[pastoralism]], partly superimposed on the ''Gumelni\u0163a culture'') and, later, on the ''[[Tei culture]]'', evolved on Bucharest soil.<ref>Giurescu, p.26; Morintz and Rosetti, p.18-27</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], the area was inhabited by a population identified with the ''[[Getae]]'' and the ''[[Dacians]]'', who spoke an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]]. The view that the two groups were the same is disputed,<ref>For the dispute's relevancy to Bucharest, see Giurescu, p.30</ref> while the culture's latter phase can be attributed to the Dacians; small Dacian settlements\u2014such as [[Her\u0103str\u0103u]], Radu Vod\u0103, [[D\u0103m\u0103roaia]], [[Lacul Tei]], [[Pantelimon, Ilfov|Pantelimon]], and [[Pope\u015fti-Leordeni]]\u2014were found around Bucharest.<ref>Giurescu, p.32-34; Morintz and Rosetti, p.28-31</ref> These populations had commercial links with the [[List of ancient Greek cities|Greek cities]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] \u2013 [[Ancient Greece|ancient-Greek]] coins were found at Lacul Tei and Her\u0103str\u0103u (together with a large amount of local [[counterfeit]] ones), and jewels and coins of Roman origin in [[Giule\u015fti]] and Lacul Tei.<ref>Giurescu, p.33; Morintz and Rosetti, p.28-29</ref>\n\nBucharest was never under [[Roman Dacia|Roman rule]], with an exception during [[Muntenia]]'s brief conquest by the troops of [[Constantine I]] in the 330s; coins from the times of Constantine, [[Valens]], and [[Valentinian I]] etc. were uncovered at various sites in and around Bucharest.<ref>Giurescu, p.37; Morintz and Rosetti, p.33</ref> It is assumed that the local population was [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanized]] after the initial retreat of Roman troops from the region, during the [[Age of Migrations]] (''see [[Origin of the Romanians]], [[Romania in the Early Middle Ages]]'').\n\n==Foundation==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:Curtea Veche 1.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Curtea Veche]]'', the old princely court]]\n[[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] founded several settlements in the Bucharest region, as pointed out by the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] names of [[Ilfov County|Ilfov]] (from ''elha'' \u2013 \"[[alder]]\"), [[Colentina, Bucharest|Colentina]], [[Snagov]], [[Glina, Ilfov|Glina]],  [[Chiajna]] etc.<ref>Giurescu, p.38</ref> According to some researches, the Slavic population was already [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] before the end of the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]].<ref>Giurescu, p.38-39</ref> According to some studies, the area was part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] between 681 and c.1000.<ref>\u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b \u041d. \u0417\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438, ''\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u044a\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0435'', \u0427\u0430\u0441\u0442 I, II \u0438\u0437\u0434., \u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f 1970, p.323</ref> While maintaining commercial links with the [[Byzantine Empire]] (as attested by the excavations of 9th\u201312th century Byzantine coins at various locations),<ref>Giurescu, p.39; Morintz and Rosetti, p.33</ref> the area was subject to the successive invasions of [[Pechenegs]] and [[Cumans]] and conquered by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] during the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]].<ref>Giurescu, p.39</ref> It was probably later disputed between the [[Magyars]] and [[Second Bulgarian Empire]].<ref>Giurescu, p.39; Morintz and Rosetti, p.34</ref>\n\nAccording to a legend first attested in the 19th century, the city was founded by a shepherd named [[Bucur (legendary shepherd)|Bucur]] (or, alternatively, a [[boyar]] of that same name).<ref>Giurescu, p.42; Iona\u015fcu and Zirra, p.56</ref> Like most of the older cities in [[Muntenia]], its foundation has also been ascribed to the legendary [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian prince]] [[Radu Negru]] (in stories first recorded in the 16th century).<ref>Giurescu, p.44</ref> The theory identifying Bucharest with a \"[[D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a River|D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a]] [[citadel]]\" and ''[[Burgrave|p\u00e2rc\u0103lab]]'' mentioned in connection with [[Vladislav I of Wallachia]] (in the 1370s)<ref>Giurescu, p.42, 47; Iona\u015fcu and Zirra, p.58</ref> is contradicted by [[archaeology]], which has shown that the area was virtually uninhabited during the 14th century.<ref>Iona\u015fcu and Zirra, p.58-59, 75</ref>\n\n===Early development===\n[[Image:Writ of the Wallachian voivode Radu cel Frumos from 14 October 1465.jpg|thumb|200px|Writ issued by the Wallachian Prince [[Radu cel Frumos]] from his residence in Bucharest]]\nBucharest was first mentioned on September 20, 1459, as one of the residences of Prince [[Vlad III Dracula]].<ref>Giurescu, p.50; Iona\u015fcu and Zirra, p.58</ref> It soon became the preferred summer residence of the princely court \u2013 together with [[T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte]], one of the two capitals of [[Wallachia]] \u2013 and was viewed by contemporaries as the strongest citadel in its country.<ref>Giurescu, p.52</ref> In 1476, it was sacked by the [[Moldavia]]n [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], but was nonetheless favoured as a residence by most rulers in the immediately following period<ref>Giurescu, p.53</ref> and was subject to important changes in landscape under [[Mircea Ciobanul]], who built the palace and church in [[Curtea Veche]] (the court's area), equipped the town with a [[stockade]], and took measures to provide Bucharest with fresh water and [[produce]] (early 1550s).<ref>Giurescu, p.53-55, 61; p.147, 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nWhen Mircea Ciobanul was deposed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] (Wallachia's overlord) in the spring of 1554, Bucharest was ravaged by [[Janissary]] troops; violence again occurred after Mircea returned to the throne and attacked those who had been loyal to [[P\u0103tra\u015fcu cel Bun]] (February 1558),<ref>Giurescu, p.57</ref> during the 1574 conflict between [[Vintil\u0103 of Wallachia|Vintil\u0103]] and [[Alexandru II Mircea]], and under the rule of [[Alexandru cel R\u0103u]] (early 1590s).<ref>Giurescu, p.60-61, 63</ref>\n\n==17th century==\n\n===Growth and decline===\nIn tune with the increasing demands of the Ottomans and the growing in importance of trade with the [[Balkans]], the political and commercial center of Wallachia began gravitating towards the south; before the end of the 17th century, Bucharest became Wallachia's most populous city, and one of the largest ones in the region, while its landscape became cosmopolitan.<ref>Giurescu, p.59, 77</ref> This was, however, accompanied by a drastic decrease in princely authority, and a decline of state resources.\n\nOn November 13, 1594, the city witnessed widespread violence, upon the start of [[Michael the Brave]]'s uprising against the Ottomans, and the massacre of Ottoman [[creditor]]s, who held control over Wallachia's resources, followed by a clash between Wallachians and the Ottoman troops stationed in Bucharest.<ref>Giurescu, p.63-64</ref> In retaliation, Bucharest was attacked and almost completely destroyed by [[Sinan Pasha]]'s forces.<ref>Giurescu, p.64-67; Iona\u015fcu and Zirra, p.65-67</ref> It was slowly rebuilt over the following two decades, and again surfaced as a successful competitor to [[T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte]] under [[Radu Mihnea]] (in the early 1620s).<ref>Giurescu, p.68-71</ref> [[Matei Basarab]], who divided his rule between T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte and Bucharest, restored the decaying court buildings (1640).<ref>Giurescu, p.71; Iona\u015fcu and Zirra, p.69; Rosetti, p.163</ref>\n\nBucharest was again ravaged, after only 15 years, by the 1655 rebellion of ''[[seimeni]]'' [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] against the rule of [[Constantin \u015eerban]] \u2013 the rebel troops arrested and executed a number of high-ranking [[boyars]], before being crushed by [[Transylvania]]n troops in June 1655.<ref>Giurescu, p.73</ref> Constantin \u015eerban added important buildings to the landscape, but he was also responsible for a destructive fire which was meant to prevent [[Mihnea III]] and his Ottoman allies from taking hold of an intact citadel.<ref>Giurescu, p.74</ref> According to the traveler [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]], the city was rebuilt as rapidly as it was destroyed: \"houses of stone or brick [...] are few and unfortunate, given that their ''[[Kafir|gavur]]'' masters rebel once every seven-eight years, and the Turks and [their allies] the [[Nogais|Tatars]] consequently set fire to the city; but the inhabitants, in the space of the same year, restore their small one-storeyed, but sturdy, houses\".<ref>\u00c7elebi, in Giurescu, p.75</ref> Bucharest was touched by [[famine]] and the [[bubonic plague]] in the early 1660s (the plague returned in 1675).<ref>Giurescu, p.74-75, 79</ref>\n\n===Late 1600s===\n{{main|Br\u00e2ncovenesc style}}\nBetween [[Gheorghe Ghica]]'s rule (1659\u20131660) and the end of [[\u015etefan Cantacuzino]]'s (1715/1716), Bucharest saw a period of relative peace and prosperity (despite the prolonged rivalry between the [[Cantacuzino family|Cantacuzino]] and the [[B\u0103leanu family|B\u0103leni]] families, followed by worsened relations between the former and the [[Craiove\u015fti]]).<ref>Cantea, p.99-100; Giurescu, p.77-79</ref>\n\nThe climactic moment was reached under [[\u015eerban Cantacuzino]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]], when the city embraced the [[Renaissance]] under the original form known as the ''[[Br\u00e2ncovenesc style]]'' and was expanded (growing to include the area of [[Cotroceni]]), furnished with [[Public house#Inns|inn]]s maintained by princes, and given its first educational facilities (the princely [[Saint Sava College]], 1694); Br\u00e2ncoveanu developed [[Curtea Veche]] (which probably accommodated the [[Sfatul boieresc|boyar council]] in its new version), and added two other [[palace]]s, including the [[Mogo\u015foaia Palace|one at Mogo\u015foaia]] (built in [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] style and noted for its ''[[loggia]]''); this was also the time when the future [[Calea Victoriei]] was carved out through [[Codrii Vl\u0103siei]].<ref>Djuvara, p.212; Giurescu, p.79-86</ref>\n\n==Phanariote era==\n\n===Early Phanariotes===\nIn 1716, following the anti-Ottoman rebellion of \u015etefan Cantacuzino in the context of the [[Great Turkish War]], Wallachia was placed under the more compliant rules of [[Phanariotes]], inaugurated by [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]] (who had previously reigned over [[Moldavia]]). These decisively marked Bucharest's development in several ways \u2013 the city was the unrivalled capital, being favoured by the decrease in importance of [[manorialism]] and rural centers, cumulated with the progress witnessed by the [[monetary economy]] (during the period, [[boyar]] status began revolving around appointment to administrative offices, and most of the latter were centered on the princely residence, including, after 1761, the [[Ban (title)|banat]] of [[Oltenia]]).<ref>Giurescu, p.93-94</ref>\n\nPrince Nicholas' rule coincided with a series of calamities \u2013 a major fire, the first [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] occupation during the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716-18]] (1716), and another plague epidemic -, but witnessed major cultural achievements inspired by [[The Enlightenment]], such as the creation of a short-lived princely [[library]] (maintained by [[Stephan Bergler]]).<ref>Djuvara, p.47-48, 92; Giurescu, p.94-96</ref> [[Grigore II Ghica]] and [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]] maintained the commercial infrastructure, and the city became the site of a large market (probably in the [[Lipscani]] area) and [[Customs (tax)|customs]].<ref>Giurescu, p.96</ref> In 1737, during the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1737-39]], the city was again attacked by Habsburg troops and ransacked by the [[Nogais]], before suffering another major plague outbreak (followed by new outbursts in the 1750s), accompanied by a relative economic decline brought about by the competition between [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Levant]]ine and locals for official appointments.<ref>Giurescu, p.96-98</ref>\n\n===Russo-Turkish Wars===\n{{main|History of the Russo-Turkish wars}}\n[[Image:Mavrogheni trasura cerbi.jpg|thumb|right| 200px|[[Nicholas Mavrogenes]], [[Phanariote]] [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] of [[Wallachia]], riding through [[Bucharest]] in a deer\u2212drawn carriage (late 1780s)]]\nBucharest was twice occupied by [[Imperial Russia]]n troops during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)|War of 1768\u201374]] (initially aided by [[P\u00e2rvu Cantacuzino]]'s anti-Ottoman boyar rebellion, and then stormed by the troops of [[Nicholas Repnin]]); the subsequent [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] was partly negotiated in the city.<ref>Djuvara, p.49, 285; Giurescu, p.98-99</ref>\n\nUnder [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1725\u20131805)|Alexander Ypsilantis]], large-scale works to provide the city with fresh water were carried out, and [[Curtea Veche]], destroyed by the previous conflicts, was replaced by a new residence in [[Dealul Spirii]] (''[[Curtea Nou\u0103]]'', 1776); his legacy was carried out by [[Nicholas Mavrogenes]].<ref>Djuvara, p.49, 207; Giurescu, p.103-105</ref> The [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u201392)|Russo-Turkish\u2013Austrian War]] erupted in 1787, and Mavrogenes retreated in front of a new Habsburg invasion, led by [[Prince Josias of Coburg]] (1789).<ref>Giurescu, p.105-106</ref> Despite other epidemics, coupled with the immense taxes imposed by [[Constantine Hangerli]], and the major earthquake of October 14, 1802 (followed by ones in 1804 and 1812), the city's population continued to increase.<ref>Djuvara, p.281-282; Giurescu, p.106-108</ref> During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u201312)|Russo-Turkish War of 1806\u201312]], Russian troops under [[Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich]] entered the city to reinstate [[Constantine Ypsilantis]] in late December 1806;<ref>Djuvara, p.287-288; Giurescu, p.107-109</ref> it was under the latter's rule that [[Manuc's Inn]] had been built by [[Manuc Bei|Emanuel M\u00e2rzaian]].\n\nAfter the peace signed in Bucharest, the rule of [[John Caradja]] brought a series of important cultural and social events (the reformist ''Caragea law'', the first [[hot air balloon]] ride in the country, the first theater play, the first cloth manufacture, and the first private [[printing press]], [[Gheorghe Laz\u0103r]]'s educational activities), but also witnessed the devastating ''[[Caragea's plague]]'' in 1813\u20131814 \u2013 which made between 25,000 and 40,000 casualties.<ref>Djuvara, p.215, 287\u2013288, 293\u2013295; Giurescu, p.110-111, 130</ref> Sources of the time indicate that the city alternated dense agglomerations with large privately owned gardens and [[orchard]]s, a pattern which made impossible the task of calculating its actual area.<ref>Djuvara, p.165, 168\u2013169; Giurescu, p.252</ref>\n\nThe [[Greek War of Independence]] and the contemporary [[Wallachian uprising (1821)|Wallachian uprising]] brought Bucharest under the brief rule of the [[Vladimirescu's Pandurs|pandur]] leader [[Tudor Vladimirescu]] (March 21, 1821), and was then occupied by the [[Filiki Eteria]] forces of Major General [[Alexander Ypsilantis]] \u2013 before seeing the violent Ottoman reprisals (ending in a massacre during August, one which made over 800 victims).<ref>Djuvara, p.298-304, 293\u2013295; Giurescu, p.114-119</ref>\n\n==Kiselyov and Alexandru II Ghica==\n{{main|Regulamentul Organic}}\n[[Image:Hanul lui Manuc, 1841.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Manuc's Inn]] in 1841]]\nThe following non-Phanariote reign of [[Grigore IV Ghica]], acclaimed by the Bucharesters upon its establishment, saw the building of a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] princely residence in [[Colentina, Bucharest|Colentina]], the expulsion of foreign [[clergy]]men who had competed with Wallachians for religious offices, and the restoration of bridges over the [[D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a River]], but also high taxes and a number of fires.<ref>Djuvara, p.147; Giurescu, p.119-120</ref>\n\nGhica was removed from his position by the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|new Russo-Turkish War]] and the Russian occupation of May 16, 1828; subsequently, the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|peace of Adrianople]] placed the whole of the [[Danubian Principalities]]' territory under military governorate (still under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), pending the payement of [[war reparations]] by the Ottomans.<ref>Djuvara, p.321;

One of the major landscape interventions by early Communist leaders was the addition of [[Socialist realism|Socialist realist]] buildings, including the large [[Casa Presei Libere|Casa Sc\u00eenteii]] (1956) and the [[Romanian National Opera, Bucharest|National Opera]]. As a tendency for the entire period of Communist rule, the city underwent massive geographical and populational expansion: it began extending, westwards, eastwards and southwards, with new, [[tower block]]-dominated districts such as [[Titan, Bucharest|Titan]], [[Militari]], [[Pantelimon, Bucharest|Pantelimon]], [[Dristor]], and [[Drumul Taberei]].\n\nDuring [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]]'s leadership, much of the historical part of the city, including old churches, was destroyed, to be replaced with the immense buildings of [[Centrul Civic]] \u2013 notably, the [[Palace of the Parliament]], which replaced about 1.8&nbsp;km\u00b2 of old buildings (''see [[Ceau\u015fima]]''). Alongside buildings characterised by a continuation of Socialist realism, Bucharest was home to several large-scale ones of a more generic [[Modern architecture|modernist]] style ([[Sala Palatului]], the [[Globus Circus]], and the [[InterContinental Hotel, Bucharest|Intercontinental Hotel]]).<ref>''Patrimoniul Arhitectural al Secolului XX'' (''Arhitectura dictaturii ceau\u015fiste'')</ref> By the time it was toppled, the regime had begun constructing a series of huge identical markets, commonly known as \"[[hunger circus]]es\", and started digging the never-finished [[Danube-Bucharest Canal]].

In 1992, the first connection to the [[Internet]] took place at the [[Polytechnic University of Bucharest]].\n\nThe [[Colectiv nightclub fire]] killed 64 individuals, in a fast-spreading fire and resulting stampede, in October 2015. It was the country's deadliest-ever nightclub fire, the city's (and one of Romania's) worst accidental losses of life since the end of the civil war in 1989, and one of the deadliest incidents of any kind since that time. Many victims who were not trampled to death were killed through smoke inhalation and/or extensive burns.

Although they lacked clear defense duties, given that Bucharest was not fortified, they became the basis for [[military recruitment]] in the small city [[garrison]]. Trading guilds became predominant over those of [[artisan]]s during the 19th century, and all autochthonous ones collapsed under competition from the ''[[sudi\u0163i]]'' [[wholesale]] traders (protected by foreign diplomats), and disappeared altogether after 1875, when mass-produced imports from [[Austria-Hungary]] flooded the market.<ref>Djuvara, 184\u2013187; Giurescu, 288\u2013289</ref>\n\n==Religious and communal history==\n[[Image:Church of the Patriarchy Bucharest.jpg|thumb|230px|left|The Church of the Patriarchy]]\nBucharest is home to the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] [[Patriarch of All Romania|Patriarchy]] and the [[Metropolitan of Hungro-Wallachia|Wallachian Metropolitan seat]], of the [[Romanian Roman-Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Archbishopric]] (established in 1883) and [[Apostolic Nunciature]], of the Archbishopric and [[Eparchy]] Council of the local [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], of the leadership of the [[Romanian ethnic minorities parties|Federation of the Jewish Communities of Romania]] as well as an important site for other religions and churches.\n\nIn [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]]'s times, a large number of religious locations were demolished to make room for tower blocks and other landmarks; the former included [[V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti Monastery]], which was torn down during works to enlarge the [[V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti Lake]].\n\n===Romanian Orthodoxy===\nFor much of Bucharest's history, its neighbourhoods were designated by the names of the more important Orthodox churches in the respective areas.

A certain number of local Jews were deported to [[Transnistria]] by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime, but most of them remained on the spot, being forcefully assigned to labor duties like cleaning out snow, sorting out the debris resulting from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings etc.<ref>Giurescu, p.208</ref> As a result of the WWII holocaust and emigration both to Israel and other countries the Jewish population was drastically reduced.\nNotable institutions of the community nowadays include the [[Bucharest Synagogue]] and the [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theater]].\n\n===Other communities===\n[[Image:Bucharest Catholic 2.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Saint Joseph Cathedral in Bucharest|Saint Joseph Cathedral]]]]\nMajority-[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] groups other than [[Romanians]] included sizeable communities of [[Greeks in Romania|Greeks]] (a highly influential and omnipresent one for much of the city's history, it was mentioned in Bucharest as early as 1561 and, after reaching its peak in the 18th century, entered a process of regression), [[Aromanians]] (first attested in 1623, but probably counted among the Greeks by previous testimonials), [[Serbs in Romania|Serbs]] and [[Bulgarians]], alongside other [[South Slavs]] (Bulgarians and Serbs were confounded in common reference until the 19th century; at the same time, sources more readily distinguished between groups of traders from [[Gabrovo]], [[Chiprovtsi]], or [[Razgrad]]; an important group of Bulgarians retreated with the Russians at the close of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|war of 1828\u20131829]], and settled in Bucharest as gardeners and milkmen), as well as [[Arabs|Arab]] parishioners of the [[Antiochian Orthodox Church]], [[Russians]] (''see also [[Bucharest Russian Church]]''), and most of the [[Albanians of Romania|Albanians]] present.<ref>Djuvara, p.183; Giurescu, p.124, 183, 267\u2013269, 272\u2013273</ref> Protected by the Church more than actually being considered its parishioners,<ref>Djuvara, p.270</ref> the [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] were, until 1855, [[Slavery|slaves]] of [[boyar]]s and of the Church itself; in 1860, 9,000 Bucharesters were thought to have been Roma.<ref>Giurescu, p.267, 274</ref>\n\n[[Image:Bucharest Lutheran.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Lutheran Church]]\nPresently, there are 18 [[Romanian Roman-Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] places of worship in Bucharest, including [[Bucharest B\u0103r\u0103\u0163ia|B\u0103r\u0103\u0163ia]] (built in 1741, rebuilt 1861), the [[:ro:Catedrala Sf\u00e2ntul Iosif|Saint Joseph Cathedral]] (1884) and the [[Italian Church (Bucharest)|Italian Church]] (1916).

The forested area, especially the [[Colentina River|Colentina]] and [[D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a River|D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a]] valleys, were home to small, scattered settlements as early as the [[Paleolithic]]; during the [[Neolithic]], Bucharest saw the presence of the ''[[Glina culture]]'', and, before the 19th century BC, was included in areas of the ''[[Gumelni\u0163a culture]]''.<ref>Giurescu, p.25-26; Morintz and Rosetti, p.12-18</ref> During the [[Bronze Age]], a third phase of the ''Glina culture'' (centered on [[pastoralism]], partly superimposed on the ''Gumelni\u0163a culture'') and, later, on the ''[[Tei culture]]'', evolved on Bucharest soil.<ref>Giurescu, p.26; Morintz and Rosetti, p.18-27</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], the area was inhabited by a population identified with the ''[[Getae]]'' and the ''[[Dacians]]'', who spoke an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]]. The view that the two groups were the same is disputed,<ref>For the dispute's relevancy to Bucharest, see Giurescu, p.30</ref> while the culture's latter phase can be attributed to the Dacians; small Dacian settlements\u2014such as [[Her\u0103str\u0103u]], Radu Vod\u0103, [[D\u0103m\u0103roaia]], [[Lacul Tei]], [[Pantelimon, Ilfov|Pantelimon]], and [[Pope\u015fti-Leordeni]]\u2014were found around Bucharest.<ref>Giurescu, p.32-34;

p.147, 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nWhen Mircea Ciobanul was deposed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] (Wallachia's overlord) in the spring of 1554, Bucharest was ravaged by [[Janissary]] troops; violence again occurred after Mircea returned to the throne and attacked those who had been loyal to [[P\u0103tra\u015fcu cel Bun]] (February 1558),<ref>Giurescu, p.57</ref> during the 1574 conflict between [[Vintil\u0103 of Wallachia|Vintil\u0103]] and [[Alexandru II Mircea]], and under the rule of [[Alexandru cel R\u0103u]] (early 1590s).<ref>Giurescu, p.60-61, 63</ref>\n\n==17th century==\n\n===Growth and decline===\nIn tune with the increasing demands of the Ottomans and the growing in importance of trade with the [[Balkans]], the political and commercial center of Wallachia began gravitating towards the south; before the end of the 17th century, Bucharest became Wallachia's most populous city, and one of the largest ones in the region, while its landscape became cosmopolitan.<ref>Giurescu, p.59, 77</ref> This was, however, accompanied by a drastic decrease in princely authority, and a decline of state resources.\n\nOn November 13, 1594, the city witnessed widespread violence, upon the start of [[Michael the Brave]]'s uprising against the Ottomans, and the massacre of Ottoman [[creditor]]s, who held control over Wallachia's resources, followed by a clash between Wallachians and the Ottoman troops stationed in Bucharest.<ref>Giurescu, p.63-64</ref> In retaliation, Bucharest was attacked and almost completely destroyed by [[Sinan Pasha]]'s forces.<ref>Giurescu, p.64-67; Iona\u015fcu and Zirra, p.65-67</ref> It was slowly rebuilt over the following two decades, and again surfaced as a successful competitor to [[T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte]] under [[Radu Mihnea]] (in the early 1620s).<ref>Giurescu, p.68-71</ref> [[Matei Basarab]], who divided his rule between T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte and Bucharest, restored the decaying court buildings (1640).<ref>Giurescu, p.71; Iona\u015fcu and Zirra, p.69; Rosetti, p.163</ref>\n\nBucharest was again ravaged, after only 15 years, by the 1655 rebellion of ''[[seimeni]]'' [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] against the rule of [[Constantin \u015eerban]] \u2013 the rebel troops arrested and executed a number of high-ranking [[boyars]], before being crushed by [[Transylvania]]n troops in June 1655.<ref>Giurescu, p.73</ref> Constantin \u015eerban added important buildings to the landscape, but he was also responsible for a destructive fire which was meant to prevent [[Mihnea III]] and his Ottoman allies from taking hold of an intact citadel.<ref>Giurescu, p.74</ref> According to the traveler [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]], the city was rebuilt as rapidly as it was destroyed: \"houses of stone or brick [...] are few and unfortunate, given that their ''[[Kafir|gavur]]'' masters rebel once every seven-eight years, and the Turks and [their allies] the [[Nogais|Tatars]] consequently set fire to the city; but the inhabitants, in the space of the same year, restore their small one-storeyed, but sturdy, houses\".<ref>\u00c7elebi, in Giurescu, p.75</ref> Bucharest was touched by [[famine]] and the [[bubonic plague]] in the early 1660s (the plague returned in 1675).<ref>Giurescu, p.74-75, 79</ref>\n\n===Late 1600s===\n{{main|Br\u00e2ncovenesc style}}\nBetween [[Gheorghe Ghica]]'s rule (1659\u20131660) and the end of [[\u015etefan Cantacuzino]]'s (1715/1716), Bucharest saw a period of relative peace and prosperity (despite the prolonged rivalry between the [[Cantacuzino family|Cantacuzino]] and the [[B\u0103leanu family|B\u0103leni]] families, followed by worsened relations between the former and the [[Craiove\u015fti]]).<ref>Cantea, p.99-100; Giurescu, p.77-79</ref>\n\nThe climactic moment was reached under [[\u015eerban Cantacuzino]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]], when the city embraced the [[Renaissance]] under the original form known as the ''[[Br\u00e2ncovenesc style]]'' and was expanded (growing to include the area of [[Cotroceni]]), furnished with [[Public house#Inns|inn]]s maintained by princes, and given its first educational facilities (the princely [[Saint Sava College]], 1694); Br\u00e2ncoveanu developed [[Curtea Veche]] (which probably accommodated the [[Sfatul boieresc|boyar council]] in its new version), and added two other [[palace]]s, including the [[Mogo\u015foaia Palace|one at Mogo\u015foaia]] (built in [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] style and noted for its ''[[loggia]]''); this was also the time when the future [[Calea Victoriei]] was carved out through [[Codrii Vl\u0103siei]].<ref>Djuvara, p.212; Giurescu, p.79-86</ref>\n\n==Phanariote era==\n\n===Early Phanariotes===\nIn 1716, following the anti-Ottoman rebellion of \u015etefan Cantacuzino in the context of the [[Great Turkish War]], Wallachia was placed under the more compliant rules of [[Phanariotes]], inaugurated by [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]] (who had previously reigned over [[Moldavia]]). These decisively marked Bucharest's development in several ways \u2013 the city was the unrivalled capital, being favoured by the decrease in importance of [[manorialism]] and rural centers, cumulated with the progress witnessed by the [[monetary economy]] (during the period, [[boyar]] status began revolving around appointment to administrative offices, and most of the latter were centered on the princely residence, including, after 1761, the [[Ban (title)|banat]] of [[Oltenia]]).<ref>Giurescu, p.93-94</ref>\n\nPrince Nicholas' rule coincided with a series of calamities \u2013 a major fire, the first [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] occupation during the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716-18]] (1716), and another plague epidemic -, but witnessed major cultural achievements inspired by [[The Enlightenment]], such as the creation of a short-lived princely [[library]] (maintained by [[Stephan Bergler]]).<ref>Djuvara, p.47-48, 92;

Many victims who were not trampled to death were killed through smoke inhalation and/or extensive burns. Three days of national mourning were observed, and blood drives were held.\n\n==Administrative history==\n{{See also|Sectors of Bucharest}}\nA local administration was first attested under [[Petru cel T\u00e2n\u0103r]] (in 1563), when a group of ''[[p\u00e2rgar]]i'' countersigned a property purchase; the city's borders, established by [[Mircea Ciobanul]], were confirmed by [[Matei Basarab]] in the 1640s, but the inner borders between properties remained rather chaotic, and were usually confirmed periodically by the ''[[Jude (title)|Jude]]'' and his ''p\u00e2rgari''.<ref>Giurescu, p.55, 60, 71, 333\u2013334</ref> Self-administration [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s were denied to Bucharesters and taken over by the [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Princes]] during the rule of [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]] and the ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]]'' period \u2013 in 1831, the population was allowed to elect a local council and was awarded a local [[budget]]; the council was expanded under [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], under whom the first [[Mayor of Bucharest]], [[Barbu Vl\u0103doianu]], was elected.<ref>Giurescu, p.338, 349</ref>\n\nThe [[guild]]s (''bresle'' or ''isnafuri''), covering a large range of employments and defined either by trade or ethnicity, formed self-administrating units from the 17th century until the late 19th century. Several ''isnafuri'' in the [[Lipscani]] area gave their names to streets which still exist. Although they lacked clear defense duties, given that Bucharest was not fortified, they became the basis for [[military recruitment]] in the small city [[garrison]]. Trading guilds became predominant over those of [[artisan]]s during the 19th century, and all autochthonous ones collapsed under competition from the ''[[sudi\u0163i]]'' [[wholesale]] traders (protected by foreign diplomats), and disappeared altogether after 1875, when mass-produced imports from [[Austria-Hungary]] flooded the market.<ref>Djuvara, 184\u2013187; Giurescu, 288\u2013289</ref>\n\n==Religious and communal history==\n[[Image:Church of the Patriarchy Bucharest.jpg|thumb|230px|left|The Church of the Patriarchy]]\nBucharest is home to the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] [[Patriarch of All Romania|Patriarchy]] and the [[Metropolitan of Hungro-Wallachia|Wallachian Metropolitan seat]], of the [[Romanian Roman-Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Archbishopric]] (established in 1883) and [[Apostolic Nunciature]], of the Archbishopric and [[Eparchy]] Council of the local [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], of the leadership of the [[Romanian ethnic minorities parties|Federation of the Jewish Communities of Romania]] as well as an important site for other religions and churches.\n\nIn [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]]'s times, a large number of religious locations were demolished to make room for tower blocks and other landmarks; the former included [[V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti Monastery]], which was torn down during works to enlarge the [[V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti Lake]].\n\n===Romanian Orthodoxy===\nFor much of Bucharest's history, its neighbourhoods were designated by the names of the more important Orthodox churches in the respective areas. The first major religious monument in the city was the [[Curtea Veche]] church, built by [[Mircea Ciobanul]] in the 1550s, followed by ''[[Plumbuita Monastery|Plumbuita]]'' (consecrated by [[Petru cel T\u00e2n\u0103r]]).\n\n[[Constantin \u015eerban]] erected the Metropolitan Church (today's [[Romanian Patriarchal Cathedral|Patriarchal Cathedral]]) in 1658, moving the bishopric from [[T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte]] in 1668.<ref>Giurescu, p.73-74</ref> In 1678, under [[\u015eerban Cantacuzino]], the Bishopric was equipped with a [[printing press]], which published the first [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] edition of the ''[[Bible]]'' (the ''[[Cantacuzino Bible]]'') during the following year.<ref>Giurescu, p.77</ref>\n\n[[Image:Stavopoleos exterior cristi.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Stavropoleos Monastery|StavropoleosChurch]]]]\nThe large-scale urban development under Prince \u015eerban and Prince [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]] saw the building of numerous religious facilities, including [[Anthim the Iberian]]'s [[Antim Monastery]]; in 1722, [[boyar]] [[Iordache Cre\u0163ulescu]] added [[Kretzulescu Church]] to the city's landscape,<ref>Giurescu, p.86-87; Rosetti, p. 163</ref> during a period when most new places of worship were being dedicated by trader [[guild]]s.<ref>Giurescu, p.89-90</ref>\n\n[[Phanariote]] rulers consecrated several major places of worship, including, among others, the  V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti Monastery (1720), a monumental [[Byzantine architecture|late-Byzantine]] site, the [[Stavropoleos Monastery|Stavropoleos Church]] (1724) \u2013 both built under [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]] -, [[Popa Nan Church|Popa Nan]] (1719), [[Domni\u0163a B\u0103la\u015fa Church|Domni\u0163a B\u0103la\u015fa]] (1751), the one in [[Pantelimon, Bucharest|Pantelimon]] (1752), [[Schitu M\u0103gureanu]] (1756), [[Icoanei Church|Icoanei]] (1786), and [[Amzei Church|Amzei]] (ca.1808).<ref>Djuvara, p.47; Iona\u015fcu and Zirra, p.75; Giurescu, p.94, 96, 100\u2013101</ref> Another period of growth in the building of Orthodox religious sites was the inter-war one: 23 new churches were added before 1944.<ref>Giurescu, p.194</ref>\n\n===Jewish history of Bucharest===\n[[Image:Templul Coral 01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Bucharest Choral Synagogue]]]]\n{{main|History of the Jews in Romania}}\nThe [[Jew]]ish community of Bucharest was, at least initially, overwhelmingly [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] (until [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] began arriving from [[Moldavia]] in the early 19th century). Jews were first attested as shop owners under [[Mircea Ciobanul]] (ca.1550), and despite frequent{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} persecutions and [[pogrom]]s, formed a large part of the professional elites for most of Bucharest's history, and the largest percentage of the total population after Romanians (around 11%). The main Jewish-inhabited areas were centered on the present-day [[Unirii Square]] and the [[V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti, Bucharest|V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti]] neighbourhood.<ref>Djuvara, p.179; Giurescu, p.271-272</ref>\n\nIn World War II, Jews were the target of widespread violence during the [[National Legionary State]] regime and, many were attacked and had their property looted, while others were eventually killed. During the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Iron Guard Rebellion]] in January 1941 some 130 Jews were brutally tortured and murdered. A certain number of local Jews were deported to [[Transnistria]] by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime, but most of them remained on the spot, being forcefully assigned to labor duties like cleaning out snow, sorting out the debris resulting from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings etc.<ref>Giurescu, p.208</ref> As a result of the WWII holocaust and emigration both to Israel and other countries the Jewish population was drastically reduced.\nNotable institutions of the community nowadays include the [[Bucharest Synagogue]] and the [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theater]].\n\n===Other communities===\n[[Image:Bucharest Catholic 2.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Saint Joseph Cathedral in Bucharest|Saint Joseph Cathedral]]]]\nMajority-[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] groups other than [[Romanians]] included sizeable communities of [[Greeks in Romania|Greeks]] (a highly influential and omnipresent one for much of the city's history, it was mentioned in Bucharest as early as 1561 and, after reaching its peak in the 18th century, entered a process of regression), [[Aromanians]] (first attested in 1623, but probably counted among the Greeks by previous testimonials), [[Serbs in Romania|Serbs]] and [[Bulgarians]], alongside other [[South Slavs]] (Bulgarians and Serbs were confounded in common reference until the 19th century; at the same time, sources more readily distinguished between groups of traders from [[Gabrovo]], [[Chiprovtsi]], or [[Razgrad]]; an important group of Bulgarians retreated with the Russians at the close of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|war of 1828\u20131829]], and settled in Bucharest as gardeners and milkmen), as well as [[Arabs|Arab]] parishioners of the [[Antiochian Orthodox Church]], [[Russians]] (''see also [[Bucharest Russian Church]]''), and most of the [[Albanians of Romania|Albanians]] present.<ref>Djuvara, p.183; Giurescu, p.124, 183, 267\u2013269, 272\u2013273</ref> Protected by the Church more than actually being considered its parishioners,<ref>Djuvara, p.270</ref> the [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] were, until 1855, [[Slavery|slaves]] of [[boyar]]s and of the Church itself; in 1860, 9,000 Bucharesters were thought to have been Roma.<ref>Giurescu, p.267, 274</ref>\n\n[[Image:Bucharest Lutheran.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Lutheran Church]]\nPresently, there are 18 [[Romanian Roman-Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] places of worship in Bucharest, including [[Bucharest B\u0103r\u0103\u0163ia|B\u0103r\u0103\u0163ia]] (built in 1741, rebuilt 1861), the [[:ro:Catedrala Sf\u00e2ntul Iosif|Saint Joseph Cathedral]] (1884) and the [[Italian Church (Bucharest)|Italian Church]] (1916). The Romanian Catholic community (which includes adherents to the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Eastern Rite Church]]) has traditionally been accompanied by the presence of majority-Catholic ethnic groups: [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] traders were first mentioned in the 16th century; [[Italians of Romania|Italians]], recorded ca.1630, were traditionally employed as [[stonemason]]s; a [[Polish minority in Romania|Polish]] minority became notable after the 1863 [[January Uprising]] forced many to take refuge in Romania; the French, highly influential during the late 18th century and early 19th century, grouped 700 ethnics by the 1890s; between the two World Wars, Bucharest became home to a large [[Sz\u00e9kely]] community (probably some tens of thousands).<ref>Giurescu, p.62, 269, 272\u2013274</ref>\n\nMostly [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Gregorian]] [[Armenians]], who originally came from [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]] and [[Rousse]], were first mentioned in the 17th century, and left their mark on the entire city with the activities of [[Manuc-bei]] and [[:ro:Krikor Zambaccian|Krikor Zambaccian]] (''see also: [[Armenians in Romania]]''). They built their first church ca.1638, and their first [[Armenian language|Armenian-language]] school in 1817; a new church, built on the model of the one in [[Echmiadzin]], was consecrated in 1911.<ref>Djuvara, p.178; Giurescu, p.270-271</ref>\n\nMost [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in Bucharest have traditionally been [[Reformed Church in Hungary|Calvinist]] [[Magyars]] and [[Regat Germans|German]] [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Romania|Lutherans]], who accounted for several thousands of the city's inhabitants;<ref>Djuvara, 179; Giurescu, p.272</ref> mentioned as early as 1574, Lutherans have a church just north of [[Sala Palatului]], on ''Strada Luteran\u0103'' (the Lutheran Street).\n\n[[Islam in Romania|Islam]] was initially present through the means of the relatively minor [[Turkish people|Turkish]] community and small groups of [[Islam|Muslim]] Romas and Muslim Arabs;<ref>Giurescu, p.273</ref> it is now represented by a  growing, largely Middle Eastern immigrant community.

It was formed in 1688 to control the powers of the Governor of Madras, [[Elihu Yale]].<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/02/stories/2003040200100300.htm The First Corporation - ''The Hindu'', 2 April 2003]</ref> The Corporation was created by a Royal Charter issued on 30 December 1687 by [[James II of England|King James II]] on the advice of the chairman of the [[East India Company]], [[Sir Josiah Child|Josiah Child]], on the model of Dutch Government in the East Indies.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/> The charter constituted the existing town of Fort St. George and all the territories belonging to the town, not exceeding a distance of ten miles from the Fort, into a Corporation. The Parliamentary Act of 1792 conferred the new Corporation power to levy municipal taxes in the city. The municipal administration also commenced from this act, making provision for the administration of the city. The Municipal Act continued to be amended, constantly introducing major changes in the constitution and powers of the Corporation from time to time.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/>\n\nPrior to the establishments of the corporation, the [[Governors of Madras|Governor of Madras]] or the Company's agent managed the affairs of the [[Fort St. George (India)|Fort St George]] and its residents with the assistance of a headman, an accountant, and the head of watch and ward. The Governor sat as Madras's [[Justice of the Peace]]. Taxes were introduced by Governor [[Streynsham Master]] (1678\u20131681). Complications arising out of these impositions and the growing expenses of an expanding town led to Sir Josiah drawing up plans for a more formal body of civic administration. The Corporation was inaugurated on 29 September 1688 with power to decide on petty cases, levy rates upon the inhabitants for building of schools, a town hall and a jail, when the new Mayor, 12 Aldermen and 60 Burgesses took their oaths.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/> The first members of the Corporation were representatives from diverse ethnicities. Nathaniel Higginson was the first Mayor, and he appointed representatives from the English, Scottish, French, Portuguese, and Indian mercantile communities as Aldermen. The post of the Mayor was held for one year at a time, the Mayor being elected by the Aldermen, whose term of office was for life.\n\nBy 1856, the duties of the Corporation became more clearly defined. In 1919, the Aldermen were re-styled as 'Councillors'. The title of 'Mayor' had been replaced by 'President', and P. Theagaraya Chetty was nominated as President, the first Indian to be so chosen. However, the office of Mayor was re-created in 1933, when Kumararajah [[M. A. Muthiah Chettiar]] made the transition from last President to first new Mayor. The mayoralty has remained thereafter.\n\nBy 1901, the Corporation had grown to encompass an area of 68&nbsp;sq&nbsp;km comprising 30 territorial divisions with a population of 540,000.<ref name=\"CC_HealthInfrastructure\">{{cite web\n | last =\n | first =\n | authorlink =\n | title = Bus Route Roads\n | work =\n | publisher = Corporation of Chennai\n | date =\n | url = http://www.chennaicorporation.gov.in/departments/roads/index.htm\n | doi =\n | accessdate = 16 Dec 2012}}</ref> In 1913, the Corporation moved to the newly constructed [[Ripon Building]], which was built on parts of the People's Park. The building was named after [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]] who, as [[Viceroy of India]] from 1880 to 1884, had introduced local government reforms. He is remembered in a statue in the Corporation precincts. The first native Indian to both govern the [[Madras Presidency]] and later serve as Mayor of erstwhile [[Madras]] was the Honourable [[K.

Yet the move will mean a lot of benefits for the people of the region. The authority had established its goals which included:\n\n{{quote|Dispersing the anticipated rise in population which is estimated to rise to about 12.5 million by 2026.

It was formed in 1688 to control the powers of the Governor of Madras, [[Elihu Yale]].<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/02/stories/2003040200100300.htm The First Corporation - ''The Hindu'', 2 April 2003]</ref> The Corporation was created by a Royal Charter issued on 30 December 1687 by [[James II of England|King James II]] on the advice of the chairman of the [[East India Company]], [[Sir Josiah Child|Josiah Child]], on the model of Dutch Government in the East Indies.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/> The charter constituted the existing town of Fort St. George and all the territories belonging to the town, not exceeding a distance of ten miles from the Fort, into a Corporation. The Parliamentary Act of 1792 conferred the new Corporation power to levy municipal taxes in the city. The municipal administration also commenced from this act, making provision for the administration of the city. The Municipal Act continued to be amended, constantly introducing major changes in the constitution and powers of the Corporation from time to time.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/>\n\nPrior to the establishments of the corporation, the [[Governors of Madras|Governor of Madras]] or the Company's agent managed the affairs of the [[Fort St. George (India)|Fort St George]] and its residents with the assistance of a headman, an accountant, and the head of watch and ward. The Governor sat as Madras's [[Justice of the Peace]]. Taxes were introduced by Governor [[Streynsham Master]] (1678\u20131681). Complications arising out of these impositions and the growing expenses of an expanding town led to Sir Josiah drawing up plans for a more formal body of civic administration. The Corporation was inaugurated on 29 September 1688 with power to decide on petty cases, levy rates upon the inhabitants for building of schools, a town hall and a jail, when the new Mayor, 12 Aldermen and 60 Burgesses took their oaths.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/> The first members of the Corporation were representatives from diverse ethnicities. Nathaniel Higginson was the first Mayor, and he appointed representatives from the English, Scottish, French, Portuguese, and Indian mercantile communities as Aldermen. The post of the Mayor was held for one year at a time, the Mayor being elected by the Aldermen, whose term of office was for life.\n\nBy 1856, the duties of the Corporation became more clearly defined. In 1919, the Aldermen were re-styled as 'Councillors'. The title of 'Mayor' had been replaced by 'President', and P. Theagaraya Chetty was nominated as President, the first Indian to be so chosen. However, the office of Mayor was re-created in 1933, when Kumararajah [[M. A. Muthiah Chettiar]] made the transition from last President to first new Mayor. The mayoralty has remained thereafter.\n\nBy 1901, the Corporation had grown to encompass an area of 68&nbsp;sq&nbsp;km comprising 30 territorial divisions with a population of 540,000.<ref name=\"CC_HealthInfrastructure\">{{cite web\n | last =\n | first =\n | authorlink =\n | title = Bus Route Roads\n | work =\n | publisher = Corporation of Chennai\n | date =\n | url = http://www.chennaicorporation.gov.in/departments/roads/index.htm\n | doi =\n | accessdate = 16 Dec 2012}}</ref> In 1913, the Corporation moved to the newly constructed [[Ripon Building]], which was built on parts of the People's Park.

It was written by consulting producer [[Jane Espenson]], and was directed by [[Michael Waxman]]. Espenson wrote it to give viewers some \"crucial facts\" about Rumpelstiltskin's origins. Guest stars included [[Brad Dourif]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], Beverley Elliott, [[Ty Olsson]], [[Meghan Ory]], and Dylan Schmid.\n\nThe series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \"real world\" town by a powerful curse. In this episode, [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) runs for Sheriff against Regina's ([[Lana Parrilla]]) candidate, Sidney Glass (Esposito). Meanwhile, in the episode's flashbacks, Rumpelstiltskin's ([[Robert Carlyle]]) backstory is revealed.\n\n\"Desperate Souls\" first aired in the United States on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on January 8, 2012.  Its broadcast was watched by an estimated 10.35 million viewers, a 29 percent increase from the [[The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (Once Upon a Time)|previous episode]]. Television critics gave mostly positive reviews to the episode; most praised Carlyle's performance, but one noted that the storytelling was beginning to \"feel stale.\"\n\n==Plot==\n===Opening sequence===\nZoso is shown in the forest.\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nIt has been two weeks since Sheriff Graham's ([[Jamie Dornan]]) death, and the citizens of Storybrooke continue to mourn. Mr. Gold ([[Robert Carlyle]]) convinces [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) she ought to be sheriff, but Regina ([[Lana Parrilla]]) has already appointed Sidney Glass ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) for the job. Henry ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]) suspects Regina is responsible for Graham's death and starts to believe good cannot defeat evil because good plays by the rules. Gold offers Emma his support and reveals to her the town charter which states the Mayor can only choose a candidate for Sheriff and therefore an election must be held. Emma decides to run, so Regina declares Sidney Glass will as well. Henry becomes worried when he finds out Gold is Emma's benefactor, considering how dangerous it is to owe him one favor, let alone two. Regina is furious that Gold would work against her.\n\nGold's plan was to set a fire at the Mayor's office with Emma there, knowing her conscience would force her to save Regina and look like a hero. This goes off perfectly, making Emma the town favorite going into the debate. When she finds out that Gold did this, Emma realizes Henry might be right about evil not playing by the rules. At the debate, Sidney explains what would make him the best sheriff following Regina's script to the letter. Emma reveals to the public that Gold set the fire, demonstrating her own honesty and integrity as well as Gold's ruthlessness. Later that evening at Granny's Cafe, Emma consoles herself with liquor when Henry walks in with the walkie talkies, saying that he was proud of her and they might continue \"Operation Cobra.\" Regina, Archie ([[Raphael Sbarge]]), Mary Margaret ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) and Sidney arrive to tell Emma she was elected Sheriff. Regina gives her the badge and admits they have one thing in common: their distrust of Gold. Emma receives a visit from her new ally who reveals the rest of his plan. Gold knew Emma would do the right thing and tell everyone what he did, winning her the election. He also tells her that while the town feared Regina, they feared him more. In standing up to him, Emma became even more compelling to the townsfolk than when she rescued Regina. Now that Emma is Sheriff, Gold expects to be paid back for his favors.\n\n===In the characters' past===\nIn the Enchanted Forest, Rumpelstiltskin's (Carlyle) backstory is revealed. During the ogre wars, the children that live in the Frontlands are conscripted to military service at age 14. The Duke's men gather young soldiers with the help of \"The Dark One\" who possesses great magical power. Rumpelstiltskin's son, Baelfire (Dylan Schmid), will turn 14 in three days and he is desperate to keep his child out of battle. As father and son flee from the village, they are confronted by the Duke's men. They mock Rumpelstiltskin for running away when he was supposed to serve, and reveal that his cowardice caused his wife to leave him. Rumpelstiltskin begs for his son's life but he has nothing to offer but fealty. The Duke's chief soldier commands Rumpelstiltskin to kiss his boot, but when the desperate man bends down the soldier kicks him to the ground. The old beggar ([[Brad Dourif]]) by the side of the road sees this and offers the pair assistance since they spared him a coin. The beggar tells Rumpelstiltskin a secret, the Duke possesses a dagger that allows him to command The Dark One and all his power. If Rumpelstiltskin steals the dagger, he will control The Dark One himself. If he kills The Dark One with the dagger, he will possess his magic. Rumpelstiltskin sets fire to the Duke's castle (in a parallel with Mr. Gold's actions) and steals the dagger which reads the name of The Dark One, \"Zoso\".\n\nBaelfire is worried about his father's plan to wield the dagger's power but Rumpelstiltskin just sends him home. Rumpelstiltskin summons Zoso and declares he is The Dark One's master. Zoso is not impressed and wonders aloud what the timid little man would have him do. Rumpelstiltskin's answer is \"Die!\" He kills The Dark One who reveals himself to be the beggar from before. Zoso laughs and tells Rumpelstiltskin that \"All magic comes with a price.\" Rumpelstiltskin becomes the new Dark One and his name is now inscribed on the dagger. He returns home and uses his power to save his son from the Duke's men. Baelfire is terrified of this man who no longer seems like his father at all.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Portrait of Jane Espenson.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Consulting producer [[Jane Espenson]] wrote \"Desperate Souls,\" her second such credit for the series.]]\n\"Desperate Souls\" was written by consulting producer [[Jane Espenson]], while ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]'' veteran [[Michael Waxman]] served as director.<ref name=ignreview/> The episode was Espenson's second writing credit for the series at that point.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/jane-espenson/credits/298994 |title=Jane Espenson: Credits |work=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}</ref><ref name=futoncritic>{{Cite press release |url=http://www.abcmedianet.com/assets/pr%5Chtml/121911_15.html |title=Regina and Mr. Gold Take Opposite Sides When Emma Runs for Public Office, and Rumplestiltskin Tries to Track Down a Powerful Source to Keep His Son from Fighting in a Meaningless War, on ABC's \"Once Upon a Time\" |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |date=December 19, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> She intended the episode to reveal \"some crucial facts about where Rumpel comes from,\" believing him to be \"a wild card\" whose \"ulterior motives are still always very complicated.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/watch_with_kristin/spoiler_chat_glee_supernatural_once/277159#ixzz1si7SVGkn |title=Spoiler Chat: Glee, Supernatural, Once Upon a Time, Revenge and More! |publisher=[[E!|E!

It was written by consulting producer [[Jane Espenson]], and was directed by [[Michael Waxman]]. Espenson wrote it to give viewers some \"crucial facts\" about Rumpelstiltskin's origins. Guest stars included [[Brad Dourif]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], Beverley Elliott, [[Ty Olsson]], [[Meghan Ory]], and Dylan Schmid.\n\nThe series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \"real world\" town by a powerful curse. In this episode, [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) runs for Sheriff against Regina's ([[Lana Parrilla]]) candidate, Sidney Glass (Esposito). Meanwhile, in the episode's flashbacks, Rumpelstiltskin's ([[Robert Carlyle]]) backstory is revealed.\n\n\"Desperate Souls\" first aired in the United States on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on January 8, 2012.  Its broadcast was watched by an estimated 10.35 million viewers, a 29 percent increase from the [[The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (Once Upon a Time)|previous episode]]. Television critics gave mostly positive reviews to the episode; most praised Carlyle's performance, but one noted that the storytelling was beginning to \"feel stale.\"\n\n==Plot==\n===Opening sequence===\nZoso is shown in the forest.\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nIt has been two weeks since Sheriff Graham's ([[Jamie Dornan]]) death, and the citizens of Storybrooke continue to mourn. Mr. Gold ([[Robert Carlyle]]) convinces [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) she ought to be sheriff, but Regina ([[Lana Parrilla]]) has already appointed Sidney Glass ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) for the job. Henry ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]) suspects Regina is responsible for Graham's death and starts to believe good cannot defeat evil because good plays by the rules. Gold offers Emma his support and reveals to her the town charter which states the Mayor can only choose a candidate for Sheriff and therefore an election must be held. Emma decides to run, so Regina declares Sidney Glass will as well. Henry becomes worried when he finds out Gold is Emma's benefactor, considering how dangerous it is to owe him one favor, let alone two. Regina is furious that Gold would work against her.\n\nGold's plan was to set a fire at the Mayor's office with Emma there, knowing her conscience would force her to save Regina and look like a hero. This goes off perfectly, making Emma the town favorite going into the debate. When she finds out that Gold did this, Emma realizes Henry might be right about evil not playing by the rules. At the debate, Sidney explains what would make him the best sheriff following Regina's script to the letter. Emma reveals to the public that Gold set the fire, demonstrating her own honesty and integrity as well as Gold's ruthlessness. Later that evening at Granny's Cafe, Emma consoles herself with liquor when Henry walks in with the walkie talkies, saying that he was proud of her and they might continue \"Operation Cobra.\" Regina, Archie ([[Raphael Sbarge]]), Mary Margaret ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) and Sidney arrive to tell Emma she was elected Sheriff. Regina gives her the badge and admits they have one thing in common: their distrust of Gold. Emma receives a visit from her new ally who reveals the rest of his plan. Gold knew Emma would do the right thing and tell everyone what he did, winning her the election. He also tells her that while the town feared Regina, they feared him more. In standing up to him, Emma became even more compelling to the townsfolk than when she rescued Regina. Now that Emma is Sheriff, Gold expects to be paid back for his favors.\n\n===In the characters' past===\nIn the Enchanted Forest, Rumpelstiltskin's (Carlyle) backstory is revealed. During the ogre wars, the children that live in the Frontlands are conscripted to military service at age 14. The Duke's men gather young soldiers with the help of \"The Dark One\" who possesses great magical power. Rumpelstiltskin's son, Baelfire (Dylan Schmid), will turn 14 in three days and he is desperate to keep his child out of battle. As father and son flee from the village, they are confronted by the Duke's men. They mock Rumpelstiltskin for running away when he was supposed to serve, and reveal that his cowardice caused his wife to leave him. Rumpelstiltskin begs for his son's life but he has nothing to offer but fealty. The Duke's chief soldier commands Rumpelstiltskin to kiss his boot, but when the desperate man bends down the soldier kicks him to the ground. The old beggar ([[Brad Dourif]]) by the side of the road sees this and offers the pair assistance since they spared him a coin. The beggar tells Rumpelstiltskin a secret, the Duke possesses a dagger that allows him to command The Dark One and all his power. If Rumpelstiltskin steals the dagger, he will control The Dark One himself. If he kills The Dark One with the dagger, he will possess his magic. Rumpelstiltskin sets fire to the Duke's castle (in a parallel with Mr. Gold's actions) and steals the dagger which reads the name of The Dark One, \"Zoso\".\n\nBaelfire is worried about his father's plan to wield the dagger's power but Rumpelstiltskin just sends him home. Rumpelstiltskin summons Zoso and declares he is The Dark One's master. Zoso is not impressed and wonders aloud what the timid little man would have him do. Rumpelstiltskin's answer is \"Die!\" He kills The Dark One who reveals himself to be the beggar from before. Zoso laughs and tells Rumpelstiltskin that \"All magic comes with a price.\" Rumpelstiltskin becomes the new Dark One and his name is now inscribed on the dagger. He returns home and uses his power to save his son from the Duke's men. Baelfire is terrified of this man who no longer seems like his father at all.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Portrait of Jane Espenson.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Consulting producer [[Jane Espenson]] wrote \"Desperate Souls,\" her second such credit for the series.]]\n\"Desperate Souls\" was written by consulting producer [[Jane Espenson]], while ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]'' veteran [[Michael Waxman]] served as director.<ref name=ignreview/> The episode was Espenson's second writing credit for the series at that point.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/jane-espenson/credits/298994 |title=Jane Espenson: Credits |work=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}</ref><ref name=futoncritic>{{Cite press release |url=http://www.abcmedianet.com/assets/pr%5Chtml/121911_15.html |title=Regina and Mr. Gold Take Opposite Sides When Emma Runs for Public Office, and Rumplestiltskin Tries to Track Down a Powerful Source to Keep His Son from Fighting in a Meaningless War, on ABC's \"Once Upon a Time\" |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |date=December 19, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> She intended the episode to reveal \"some crucial facts about where Rumpel comes from,\" believing him to be \"a wild card\" whose \"ulterior motives are still always very complicated.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/watch_with_kristin/spoiler_chat_glee_supernatural_once/277159#ixzz1si7SVGkn |title=Spoiler Chat: Glee, Supernatural, Once Upon a Time, Revenge and More! |publisher=[[E!|E!

Between 100 and 150 million years ago, during the Lower [[Cretaceous]] Period, the [[Bay of Biscay]] [[Seafloor spreading|fanned out]], pushing present-day Spain against France and applying intense [[Compression (geology)|compressional pressure]] to large layers of [[sedimentary rock]]. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth's crust first affected the eastern part and moved progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the [[Eocene]] Epoch.\n\nThe eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of [[granite]] and [[gneiss]]ose rocks, while in the western part the granite peaks are flanked by layers of [[limestone]]. The massive and unworn character of the chain comes from its abundance of [[granite]], which is particularly resistant to [[erosion]], as well as weak [[glacier|glacial]] development.\n\nThe upper parts of the Pyrenees contain low-relief surfaces forming a [[peneplain]]. This peneplain originated no earlier than in [[Miocene|Late Miocene]] times. Presumably it formed at height as extensive sedimentation raised the local [[base level]] considerably.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Babault |first1=Julien |last2=Van Den Driessche |first2=Jean|last3=Bonnet |first3=Stephanie|last4=Castelltort |first4=S\u00e9bastien|last5=Crave |first5=Alain |date=2005 |title=Origin of the highly elevated Pyrenean peneplain |url= https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:20401/ATTACHMENT01|journal=Tectonics |volume=24 |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1029/2004TC001697 |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n== Landscape ==\nConspicuous features of Pyrenean scenery are:\n* the absence of great lakes, such as those that fill the lateral valleys of the Alps<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the rarity and relative high elevation of usable [[Mountain pass|passes]]<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the large number of the mountain torrents locally called ''[[Gave (stem)|gaves]]'', which often form lofty [[waterfall]]s, surpassed in Europe only by those of [[Scandinavia]]<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the frequency with which the upper end of a valley assumes the form of a semicircle of precipitous cliffs, called a [[cirque]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe highest [[waterfall]] is [[Gavarnie Falls|Gavarnie]] (462&nbsp;m or 1,515&nbsp;ft), at the head of the [[Gave de Pau]]; the [[Cirque de Gavarnie]], in the same valley,<ref name=EB1911/> together with the nearby Cirque de Troumouse and [[Cirque d'Estaub\u00e9]], are notable examples of the [[cirque]] formation. \n\nLow passes are lacking, and the principal roads and the railroads between France and Spain run only in the lowlands at the western and eastern ends of the Pyrenees, near sea level. The main passes of note are:\n* the [[Col de la Perche]] ({{convert|1581|m|abbr=on}}), towards the east, between the valley of the [[T\u00eat River|T\u00eat]] and the valley of the [[river Segre|Segre]], \n* the [[Pas de la Casa|Pas de la Casa or Port d'Envalira]], the highest road pass in the Pyrenees at {{convert|2408|m|abbr=on}}, and one of the highest points of the European road network, which provides the route from France to Andorra,\n* the nearby [[Col de Puymorens]] ({{convert|1920|m|abbr=on}}), on [[European route E09]] between France and Spain.\n* the [[Port de la Bonaigua]] ({{convert|2070|m|abbr=on}}), in the middle of the range at the head of the Aran Valley, although the nearly col at Plan de Beret ({{convert|1870|m|abbr=on}}) is the lowest point in the main ridge between the Col de la Perche, almost {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the east and the [[Col du Pourtalet]] ({{convert|1794|m|abbr=on}}), over {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the west.\n* the Col de [[Somport]] or Port de Canfranc ({{convert|1632|m|abbr=on}}), where there were old [[Roman road]]s. \n* the [[Roncevaux Pass]] ({{convert|1057|m|abbr=on}}), entirely in [[Navarre]] (Spain) is an important point on the [[Santiago de Compostela]] pilgrimage route\nBecause of the lack of low passes a number of tunnels have been created, beneath the passes at Somport, Envalira, and Puymorens and new routes in the center of the range at [[Bielsa]] and [[Vielha Tunnel|Vielha]].\n\nA notable visual feature of this [[mountain range]] is [[La Br\u00e8che de Roland]], a gap in the ridge line, which{{spaced ndash}}according to legend{{spaced ndash}}was created by [[Roland]].\n\n[[File:Ib\u00f3n.JPG|thumb|Ib\u00f3n (glacial lake) Basa Mora, in Gistain valley, [[Aragon]]. ]]\n\n== Natural resources ==\nThe metallic [[ore]]s of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance now, though there were [[iron]] mines at several locations in [[Geography of Andorra#Natural resources|Andorra]], as well as at [[Vicdessos]] in Ari\u00e8ge, and the foot of [[Canigou]] in [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] long ago.

The hot springs, among which those of [[Les Escaldes]] in Andorra, [[Panticosa]] and [[Lles]] in Spain, [[Ax-les-Thermes]], [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon]] and [[Eaux-Chaudes]] in France may be mentioned, are [[sulfur]]ous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre]] ([[Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]), [[Rennes-les-Bains]] ([[Aude]]), and [[Campagne-sur-Aude]] (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not hot.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Climate ==\nThe amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] the range receives, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees<ref name=EB1911/> because of the moist air that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean over the [[Bay of Biscay]]. After dropping its moisture over the western and central Pyrenees, the air is left dry over the eastern Pyrenees. The winter average temperature is {{cvt|-2|\u00b0C}}.\n\nSections of the mountain range vary in more than one respect. There are some [[glacier]]s in the western and snowy central Pyrenees, but there are no glaciers in the eastern Pyrenees because there is insufficient snowfall to cause their development. Glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down into the valleys but rather have their greatest lengths along the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, in a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there is substantial evidence of a much wider expanse of glaciation during the [[glacial period]]s. The best evidence of this is in the valley of Argeles Gazost, between Lourdes and Gavarnie, in the ''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'' of Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe annual snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from about {{convert|2700|to|2800|m}} above sea level.<ref name=EB1911/> In average the seasonal snow is observed at least 50% of the time above {{convert|1600|m}} between December and April.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gascoin|first1=S.|last2=Hagolle|first2=O.|last3=Huc|first3=M.|last4=Jarlan|first4=L.|last5=Dejoux|first5=J.F.|last6=Szczypta|first6=C.|last7=Marti|first7=R.|last8=S\u00e1nchez|first8=R.|title=A snow cover climatology for the Pyrenees from MODIS snow products|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|date=2015|issue=19|pages=2337\u20132351|doi=10.5194/hess-19-2337-2015|url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|access-date=2015-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529112043/http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|archive-date=2015-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n[[File:Cascada aigualluts.jpg|thumb|Aigualluts cascade in Benasque Valley, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]]\n{{See also|Forests of the Iberian Peninsula#The Eurosiberian region|l1=Forests of the Iberian Peninsula - Eurosiberian region}}\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{Main category|Flora of the Pyrenees}}\nA still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are wooded, but the extent of forest declines as one moves eastwards. The eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. Also moving from west to east, there is a change in the composition of the flora, with the change becoming most evident as one passes the centre of the mountain chain from which point the [[Corbi\u00e8res (region)|Corbi\u00e8res]] stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. Though the difference in latitude is only about 1\u00b0, in the west the flora resembles that of central Europe while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character. The Pyrenees are nearly as rich in [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that [[endemism]] is the occurrence of the monotypic genus ''Xatardia'' (family [[Apiaceae]]), which grows only on a high alpine pass between the Val d'Eynes and [[Catalonia]]. Other examples include ''[[Arenaria montana]]'', ''[[Bulbocodium vernum]]'', and ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]''. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the [[saxifrage]]s, several species of which are endemic here.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Fauna ===\nIn their [[fauna]] the Pyrenees present some striking instances of [[endemism]]. The [[Pyrenean desman]] is found only in some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains; the only other [[desman]]s are confined to the rivers of the [[Caucasus]] in southern Russia. The Pyrenean euprocte (''Euproctus pyrenaicus''), an endemic relative of the [[salamander]], also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among other peculiarities of Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the [[cave]]rns of Ari\u00e8ge, the principal genera of which are ''[[Anophthalmus]]'' and ''Adelops''.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pyrenees|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pyrenean ibex]] mysteriously became extinct in January 2000; the native Pyrenean [[brown bear]] was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s, but it was re-introduced in 1996 when three bears were brought from [[Slovenia]].

Between 100 and 150 million years ago, during the Lower [[Cretaceous]] Period, the [[Bay of Biscay]] [[Seafloor spreading|fanned out]], pushing present-day Spain against France and applying intense [[Compression (geology)|compressional pressure]] to large layers of [[sedimentary rock]]. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth's crust first affected the eastern part and moved progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the [[Eocene]] Epoch.\n\nThe eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of [[granite]] and [[gneiss]]ose rocks, while in the western part the granite peaks are flanked by layers of [[limestone]]. The massive and unworn character of the chain comes from its abundance of [[granite]], which is particularly resistant to [[erosion]], as well as weak [[glacier|glacial]] development.\n\nThe upper parts of the Pyrenees contain low-relief surfaces forming a [[peneplain]]. This peneplain originated no earlier than in [[Miocene|Late Miocene]] times. Presumably it formed at height as extensive sedimentation raised the local [[base level]] considerably.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Babault |first1=Julien |last2=Van Den Driessche |first2=Jean|last3=Bonnet |first3=Stephanie|last4=Castelltort |first4=S\u00e9bastien|last5=Crave |first5=Alain |date=2005 |title=Origin of the highly elevated Pyrenean peneplain |url= https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:20401/ATTACHMENT01|journal=Tectonics |volume=24 |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1029/2004TC001697 |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n== Landscape ==\nConspicuous features of Pyrenean scenery are:\n* the absence of great lakes, such as those that fill the lateral valleys of the Alps<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the rarity and relative high elevation of usable [[Mountain pass|passes]]<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the large number of the mountain torrents locally called ''[[Gave (stem)|gaves]]'', which often form lofty [[waterfall]]s, surpassed in Europe only by those of [[Scandinavia]]<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the frequency with which the upper end of a valley assumes the form of a semicircle of precipitous cliffs, called a [[cirque]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe highest [[waterfall]] is [[Gavarnie Falls|Gavarnie]] (462&nbsp;m or 1,515&nbsp;ft), at the head of the [[Gave de Pau]]; the [[Cirque de Gavarnie]], in the same valley,<ref name=EB1911/> together with the nearby Cirque de Troumouse and [[Cirque d'Estaub\u00e9]], are notable examples of the [[cirque]] formation. \n\nLow passes are lacking, and the principal roads and the railroads between France and Spain run only in the lowlands at the western and eastern ends of the Pyrenees, near sea level. The main passes of note are:\n* the [[Col de la Perche]] ({{convert|1581|m|abbr=on}}), towards the east, between the valley of the [[T\u00eat River|T\u00eat]] and the valley of the [[river Segre|Segre]], \n* the [[Pas de la Casa|Pas de la Casa or Port d'Envalira]], the highest road pass in the Pyrenees at {{convert|2408|m|abbr=on}}, and one of the highest points of the European road network, which provides the route from France to Andorra,\n* the nearby [[Col de Puymorens]] ({{convert|1920|m|abbr=on}}), on [[European route E09]] between France and Spain.\n* the [[Port de la Bonaigua]] ({{convert|2070|m|abbr=on}}), in the middle of the range at the head of the Aran Valley, although the nearly col at Plan de Beret ({{convert|1870|m|abbr=on}}) is the lowest point in the main ridge between the Col de la Perche, almost {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the east and the [[Col du Pourtalet]] ({{convert|1794|m|abbr=on}}), over {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the west.\n* the Col de [[Somport]] or Port de Canfranc ({{convert|1632|m|abbr=on}}), where there were old [[Roman road]]s. \n* the [[Roncevaux Pass]] ({{convert|1057|m|abbr=on}}), entirely in [[Navarre]] (Spain) is an important point on the [[Santiago de Compostela]] pilgrimage route\nBecause of the lack of low passes a number of tunnels have been created, beneath the passes at Somport, Envalira, and Puymorens and new routes in the center of the range at [[Bielsa]] and [[Vielha Tunnel|Vielha]].\n\nA notable visual feature of this [[mountain range]] is [[La Br\u00e8che de Roland]], a gap in the ridge line, which{{spaced ndash}}according to legend{{spaced ndash}}was created by [[Roland]].\n\n[[File:Ib\u00f3n.JPG|thumb|Ib\u00f3n (glacial lake) Basa Mora, in Gistain valley, [[Aragon]]. ]]\n\n== Natural resources ==\nThe metallic [[ore]]s of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance now, though there were [[iron]] mines at several locations in [[Geography of Andorra#Natural resources|Andorra]], as well as at [[Vicdessos]] in Ari\u00e8ge, and the foot of [[Canigou]] in [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] long ago. [[Coal]] deposits capable of being profitably worked are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes, but the French side has beds of [[lignite]].<ref name=EB1911/> The open pit of Trimoun near the commune of [[Luzenac]] (Ari\u00e8ge) is one of the greatest sources of [[talc]] in Europe.\n\n[[Mineral spring]]s are abundant and remarkable, and especially noteworthy are the [[hot spring]]s. The hot springs, among which those of [[Les Escaldes]] in Andorra, [[Panticosa]] and [[Lles]] in Spain, [[Ax-les-Thermes]], [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon]] and [[Eaux-Chaudes]] in France may be mentioned, are [[sulfur]]ous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre]] ([[Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]), [[Rennes-les-Bains]] ([[Aude]]), and [[Campagne-sur-Aude]] (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not hot.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Climate ==\nThe amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] the range receives, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees<ref name=EB1911/> because of the moist air that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean over the [[Bay of Biscay]]. After dropping its moisture over the western and central Pyrenees, the air is left dry over the eastern Pyrenees. The winter average temperature is {{cvt|-2|\u00b0C}}.\n\nSections of the mountain range vary in more than one respect. There are some [[glacier]]s in the western and snowy central Pyrenees, but there are no glaciers in the eastern Pyrenees because there is insufficient snowfall to cause their development. Glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down into the valleys but rather have their greatest lengths along the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, in a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there is substantial evidence of a much wider expanse of glaciation during the [[glacial period]]s. The best evidence of this is in the valley of Argeles Gazost, between Lourdes and Gavarnie, in the ''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'' of Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe annual snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from about {{convert|2700|to|2800|m}} above sea level.<ref name=EB1911/> In average the seasonal snow is observed at least 50% of the time above {{convert|1600|m}} between December and April.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gascoin|first1=S.|last2=Hagolle|first2=O.|last3=Huc|first3=M.|last4=Jarlan|first4=L.|last5=Dejoux|first5=J.F.|last6=Szczypta|first6=C.|last7=Marti|first7=R.|last8=S\u00e1nchez|first8=R.|title=A snow cover climatology for the Pyrenees from MODIS snow products|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|date=2015|issue=19|pages=2337\u20132351|doi=10.5194/hess-19-2337-2015|url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|access-date=2015-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529112043/http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|archive-date=2015-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n[[File:Cascada aigualluts.jpg|thumb|Aigualluts cascade in Benasque Valley, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]]\n{{See also|Forests of the Iberian Peninsula#The Eurosiberian region|l1=Forests of the Iberian Peninsula - Eurosiberian region}}\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{Main category|Flora of the Pyrenees}}\nA still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are wooded, but the extent of forest declines as one moves eastwards. The eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. Also moving from west to east, there is a change in the composition of the flora, with the change becoming most evident as one passes the centre of the mountain chain from which point the [[Corbi\u00e8res (region)|Corbi\u00e8res]] stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. Though the difference in latitude is only about 1\u00b0, in the west the flora resembles that of central Europe while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character. The Pyrenees are nearly as rich in [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that [[endemism]] is the occurrence of the monotypic genus ''Xatardia'' (family [[Apiaceae]]), which grows only on a high alpine pass between the Val d'Eynes and [[Catalonia]]. Other examples include ''[[Arenaria montana]]'', ''[[Bulbocodium vernum]]'', and ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]''. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the [[saxifrage]]s, several species of which are endemic here.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Fauna ===\nIn their [[fauna]] the Pyrenees present some striking instances of [[endemism]]. The [[Pyrenean desman]] is found only in some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains; the only other [[desman]]s are confined to the rivers of the [[Caucasus]] in southern Russia. The Pyrenean euprocte (''Euproctus pyrenaicus''), an endemic relative of the [[salamander]], also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among other peculiarities of Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the [[cave]]rns of Ari\u00e8ge, the principal genera of which are ''[[Anophthalmus]]'' and ''Adelops''.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pyrenees|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pyrenean ibex]] mysteriously became extinct in January 2000; the native Pyrenean [[brown bear]] was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s, but it was re-introduced in 1996 when three bears were brought from [[Slovenia]]. The bear population has bred successfully, and there are now believed to be about 15 brown bears in the central region around [[Fos, Haute-Garonne|Fos]], but only four native ones are still living in the [[Aspe Valley]].\n\n== Protected areas ==\n[[File:20080824-Ib\u00f3n de Barrancs.jpg|thumb|Ib\u00f3n de Barrancs ([[glacial lake]]) in Posets-Maladeta Natural Park, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]]\nPrincipal nature reserves and national parks:\n*[[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park]] (Spain)\n*[[Pyrenees National Park|Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es National Park]] (France)\n*[[Aig\u00fcestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park]] (Spain)\n*[[Natural Park of Posets-Maladeta|Posets-Maladeta Natural Park]] (Spain)\n\n== Demographics and culture ==\n[[File:Bovins estive Pic du Midi Ossau.jpg|thumb|Some [[Blonde d'Aquitaine]] on summer pasture near the [[Pic du Midi d'Ossau]]]]\nThe Pyrenean region possesses a varied ethnology, [[folklore]] and history: see [[Andorra]]; [[Aragon]]; [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]]; [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]; [[B\u00e9arn]]; [[Catalonia]]; [[Navarre]]; [[Roussillon]].

The Pyrenees are also a good place for athletes to do high-altitude training in the summertime, such as by bicycling and cross-country running.\n\nIn the [[summer]] and the [[autumn]], the Pyrenees are usually featured in two of cycling's grand tours, the [[Tour de France]] held annually in July and the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] held in September. The stages held in the Pyrenees are often crucial legs of both tours, drawing hundreds of thousands of spectators to the region.\n\nThree main [[long-distance footpath]]s run the length of the mountain range: the [[GR 10 (France)|GR 10]] across the northern slopes, the [[GR 11 (Spain)|GR 11]] across the southern slopes, and the [[Haute Randonn\u00e9e Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9enne|HRP]] which traverses peaks and ridges along a high altitude route. In addition, there are numerous marked and unmarked trails throughout the region.\n\n''[[Pirena (race)|Pirena]]'' is a dog-[[mushing]] competition held in the Pyrenees.\n\n=== Ski resorts ===\n[[File:Ski Center.jpg|thumb|Ski Center, Cerler (Spain)]]\n\n[[Skiing|Ski]] resorts in the Pyrenees include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alp 2500]] (Spain)\n* [[Arette]] (France)\n* [[Ast\u00fan]] (Spain)\n* [[Artouste]] (France)\n* [[Ax-les-Thermes]] (France)\n* [[Baqueira-Beret]] (Spain)\n* [[Bo\u00ed Ta\u00fcll Resort]] (Spain)\n* [[La Mongie|Bareges-La Mongie (Tourmalet)]] (France)\n* [[Luz Ardiden]] (France)\n* [[Bourg-d'Oueil]] (France)\n* [[Cauterets]] (France)\n* [[Candanch\u00fa]] (Spain)\n* [[Cerler]] (Spain)\n* [[Espot Esqu\u00ed]] (Spain)\n* [[Font-Romeu]] (France)\n* [[Formigal]] (Spain)\n* [[Gavarnie G\u00e8dre]]<ref>[http://pistehors.com/backcountry/wiki/Ski-Areas/Pays-Toy Pays Toy Ski Resort] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329082309/http://pistehors.com/backcountry/wiki/Ski-Areas/Pays-Toy |date=2009-03-29 }} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130731201355/http://pistehors.com/backcountry/wiki/Ski-Areas/Pays-Toy; archive])</ref> (France)\n* [[Gourette]] (France)\n* [[Guzet-Neige]] (France)\n* [[Hautacam]] (France)\n* [[La Molina (ski resort)|La Molina]] (Spain)\n* [[La Pierre Saint Martin]]\n* [[Le Mourtis]] (France)\n* [[Les Angles, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Les Angles]] (France)\n* [[Luchon-Superbagn\u00e8res]] (France)\n* [[Luz-Ardiden]] (France)\n* [[Nistos cap nestes]] (France)\n* [[Panticosa-Los Lagos]] (Spain)\n* [[Pas de la Casa]] (Andorra)\n* [[Peyragudes]] (France)\n* [[Piau-Engaly]] (France)\n* [[Port Ain\u00e9]] (Spain)\n* [[Port del Comte (ski resort)|Port del Comte]] (Spain)\n* [[Somport]] (France-Spain)\n* [[Saint Lary]] (France)\n* [[Soldeu|Soldeu / El Tarter]] (Andorra)\n* [[Superbagn\u00e8res]] (France)\n* [[Tavascan]] (Spain)\n* [[Vall de N\u00faria]] (Spain)\n* [[Vallnord]] (Andorra)\n* [[Vallter 2000]] (Spain)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Montcalm Massif]]\n* [[:Category:Mountain passes of the Pyrenees|Mountain passes of the Pyrenees]]\n* [[Pre-Pyrenees]]\n* [[Sub-Pyrenees]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|first=Hilaire|last=Belloc|title=The Pyrenees|year=1909|publisher=Methuen & Co., London}}\n* {{cite book|first= Friedrich |last= Edelmayer |title= The Pyrenees Region |year=2012|publisher=[[Institute of European History]]|language=German, English|url= http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0159-2012053102}}\n* {{cite book|first=Claus|last=Paegelow|title=Pyren\u00e4en Bibliografie.

Ratings rose in the ninth episode \"[[Something's Coming (Desperate Housewives)|Something's Coming]]\", where 20.6 million viewers tuned in to see the heavily marketed tornado episode. The show once again moved back into the top five highest-rated programs in the 2007\u20132008 season, being the number-one ABC drama and beating popular medical drama ''Grey's Anatomy'' after falling behind it for the first time in the third season. It also became for the first time the number-one scripted series, beating ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]''.\n\nAlthough ratings were down for the fifth season, along with every scripted series on television, ''Desperate Housewives'' was still the most-watched scripted series on ABC, consistently beating the other ABC flagship shows, ''Lost'' and ''Grey's Anatomy,'' although the latter is still number one in the 18\u201349 demographic, followed by ''Desperate Housewives''.\n\nSimilar to the fifth season, ratings were down for the sixth season because of heavy competition in many airings, but the show still managed to remain the second most watched scripted show on ABC and the eleventh most watched scripted show of all broadcast television. The series continued to hit lower ratings, because of competition like the [[67th Golden Globe Awards]], [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]], [[2010 Winter Olympics]], and the new [[CBS]] [[reality television]] series ''[[Undercover Boss]]''. Nevertheless, the sixth season managed to finish in the top twenty overall, both in total viewers and 18\u201349 demographic audiences.

However, after the mid-season finale the ratings returned lower, hitting the seven million viewer mark and a 2.2\u20132.5 in the demo.

The nominations of all of the leading actresses except [[Eva Longoria]] for both the Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award received some media interest. While Longoria seemingly wasn't bothered, stating for the press that \"I'm new. I just arrived. I didn't expect at all to be in the minds of the Academy\", Marc Cherry regarded them being left out as a \"horrendous error\".<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/longoria%20i%20never%20expected%20an%20emmy Longoria: \"I Never Expected an Emmy\"], ''ContactMusic.com'', July 24, 2005</ref> In the end, the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] went to [[Felicity Huffman]], while [[Teri Hatcher]] won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy Series|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Actress \u2013 Comedy Series.\n\nThe show's second Golden Globe Award for its first year was for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Series - Musical or Comedy|Best Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] at the [[62nd Golden Globe Awards]], while the other Primetime Emmy Awards went to [[Kathryn Joosten]], for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series]], for her guest role as Karen McCluskey (beating, among others, fellow cast member [[Lupe Ontiveros]]); to [[Charles McDougall]], for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]], for his direction of \"Pilot\"; to [[Danny Elfman]], for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music|Outstanding Main Title Theme Music]], for his theme music; for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series]] of \"Pilot\"; and for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series]] at the [[57th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards]].

The show was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards at the [[60th Primetime Emmy Awards]], including acting nods towards [[Polly Bergen]] and [[Kathryn Joosten]] for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Joosten won the show's seventh Primetime Emmy Award and first since its debut year.\n\nNominations continued to decline in later years. Notable nominations included nods towards [[Beau Bridges]] and [[Kathryn Joosten]] in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Additionally, [[Brenda Strong]] received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] at the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2011, a notable feat for a category usually dominated by animated series.

Ratings rose in the ninth episode \"[[Something's Coming (Desperate Housewives)|Something's Coming]]\", where 20.6 million viewers tuned in to see the heavily marketed tornado episode. The show once again moved back into the top five highest-rated programs in the 2007\u20132008 season, being the number-one ABC drama and beating popular medical drama ''Grey's Anatomy'' after falling behind it for the first time in the third season. It also became for the first time the number-one scripted series, beating ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]''.\n\nAlthough ratings were down for the fifth season, along with every scripted series on television, ''Desperate Housewives'' was still the most-watched scripted series on ABC, consistently beating the other ABC flagship shows, ''Lost'' and ''Grey's Anatomy,'' although the latter is still number one in the 18\u201349 demographic, followed by ''Desperate Housewives''.\n\nSimilar to the fifth season, ratings were down for the sixth season because of heavy competition in many airings, but the show still managed to remain the second most watched scripted show on ABC and the eleventh most watched scripted show of all broadcast television. The series continued to hit lower ratings, because of competition like the [[67th Golden Globe Awards]], [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]], [[2010 Winter Olympics]], and the new [[CBS]] [[reality television]] series ''[[Undercover Boss]]''. Nevertheless, the sixth season managed to finish in the top twenty overall, both in total viewers and 18\u201349 demographic audiences.

However, after the mid-season finale the ratings returned lower, hitting the seven million viewer mark and a 2.2\u20132.5 in the demo.

The nominations of all of the leading actresses except [[Eva Longoria]] for both the Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award received some media interest. While Longoria seemingly wasn't bothered, stating for the press that \"I'm new. I just arrived. I didn't expect at all to be in the minds of the Academy\", Marc Cherry regarded them being left out as a \"horrendous error\".<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/longoria%20i%20never%20expected%20an%20emmy Longoria: \"I Never Expected an Emmy\"], ''ContactMusic.com'', July 24, 2005</ref> In the end, the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] went to [[Felicity Huffman]], while [[Teri Hatcher]] won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy Series|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Actress \u2013 Comedy Series.\n\nThe show's second Golden Globe Award for its first year was for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Series - Musical or Comedy|Best Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] at the [[62nd Golden Globe Awards]], while the other Primetime Emmy Awards went to [[Kathryn Joosten]], for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series]], for her guest role as Karen McCluskey (beating, among others, fellow cast member [[Lupe Ontiveros]]); to [[Charles McDougall]], for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]], for his direction of \"Pilot\"; to [[Danny Elfman]], for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music|Outstanding Main Title Theme Music]], for his theme music; for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series]] of \"Pilot\"; and for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series]] at the [[57th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards]].

The show was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards at the [[60th Primetime Emmy Awards]], including acting nods towards [[Polly Bergen]] and [[Kathryn Joosten]] for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Joosten won the show's seventh Primetime Emmy Award and first since its debut year.\n\nNominations continued to decline in later years. Notable nominations included nods towards [[Beau Bridges]] and [[Kathryn Joosten]] in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Additionally, [[Brenda Strong]] received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] at the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2011, a notable feat for a category usually dominated by animated series.

As a part of the overall Anglo-Irish settlement, all other [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] personnel and equipment were to evacuate the Free State.\n\nAs part of the settlement of the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War]] in the 1930s, the ports were transferred to [[Ireland (state)|Ireland]] (the Free State's successor) in 1938 following agreements reached between the British and Irish Governments.\n\n== Terms of the treaty==\nIn 1921, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] originally offered \u2013 in an early version of the Anglo-Irish Treaty \u2013 to allow the British to continue to use the ports for a further period of five years.

In 1938 he addressed the UK's [[House of Commons]] calling it a \"folly\":\n\n{{quotation|\n:When I read this Agreement in the newspapers a week ago I was filled with surprise. On the face of it, we seem to give everything away and receive nothing in return...But then I supposed there was another side to the Agreement, and that we were to be granted some facilities and rights in Southern Ireland in time of war. That, I notice, was the view taken by a part of the Press, but soon Mr. de Valera in the D\u00e1il made it clear that he was under no obligations of any kind and, as the Prime Minister confirmed ...On the contrary, Mr. de Valera has not even abandoned his claim for the incorporation of Ulster...\n\n:We are told that we have ended the age-long quarrel between England and Ireland, but that is clearly not true, because Mr. de Valera has said that he will never rest until Partition is swept away. Therefore, the real conflict has yet to come...[The Anglo-Irish] Treaty has been kept in the letter and the spirit by Great Britain, but the Treaty has been violated and repudiated in every detail by Mr. de Valera....The ports in question, Queenstown, Berehaven and Lough Swilly, are to be handed over unconditionally, with no guarantees of any kind, as a gesture of our trust and goodwill, as the Prime Minister said, to the Government of the Irish Republic.\n\n:When the Irish Treaty was being shaped in 1922 I was instructed by the Cabinet to prepare that part of the Agreement which dealt with strategic reservations. I negotiated with Mr. Michael Collins, and I was advised by Admiral Beatty...The Admiralty of those days assured me that without the use of these ports it would be very difficult, perhaps almost impossible, to feed this Island in time of war. Queenstown and Berehaven shelter the flotillas which keep clear the approaches to the [[Bristol Channel|Bristol]] and [[English Channel]]s, and Lough Swilly is the base from which the access to the [[River Mersey|Mersey]] and the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] is covered...If we are denied the use of Lough Swilly and have to work from Lamlash, we should strike 200 miles from the effective radius of our flotillas, out and home; and if we are denied Berehaven and Queenstown, and have to work from [[Pembroke Dock]], we should strike 400 miles from their effective radius out and home. These ports are, in fact, the sentinel towers of the western approaches, by which the 45,000,000 people in this Island so enormously depend on foreign food for their daily bread, and by which they can carry on their trade, which is equally important to their existence.\n\n:In 1922 the Irish delegates made no difficulty about this. They saw that it was vital to our safety that we should be able to use these ports and, therefore, the matter passed into the structure of the Treaty without any serious controversy. Now we are to give them up, unconditionally, to an Irish Government led by men I do not want to use hard words whose rise to power has been proportionate to the animosity with which they have acted against this country, no doubt in pursuance of their own patriotic impulses, and whose present position in power is based upon the violation of solemn Treaty engagements.\n\n:But what guarantee have you that Southern Ireland, or the Irish Republic, as they claim to be and you do not contradict them will not declare neutrality if we are engaged in war with some powerful nation? Under this Agreement, it seems to me...that Mr. de Valera\u2019s Government will at some supreme moment of emergency demand the surrender of Ulster as an alternative to declaring neutrality.\n\n:Mr. de Valera has given no undertaking, except to fight against Partition as the main object of his life. It would be a serious step for a Dublin Government to attack these forts while they are in our possession and while we have the right to occupy them. It would be an easy step for a Dublin Government to deny their use to us once we have gone...You are casting away real and important means of security and survival for vain shadows and for ease.}}\n\nChurchill also remarked that the concessions under the Agreements of 1938 were \"astonishing triumphs\" for Irish leader, \u00c9amon de Valera. Churchill also asked would it not be \"far better to give up the \u00a310,000,000 [a one-off Irish payment under the Agreement], and acquire the legal right, be it only on a lease granted by treaty, to use these harbours when necessary?\" Mr Churchill also made a remark concerning the name by which the Irish state would henceforth be described in the UK (Eire) \u2013 \"I have not been able to form a clear opinion on the exact juridical position of the Government of that portion of Ireland called Southern Ireland, which is now called Eire. That is a word which really has no application at the present time, and I must say, even from the point of view of the ordinary uses of English, that it is not customary to quote a term in a foreign language, a capital town, a geographical place, when there exists a perfectly well-known English equivalent [Ireland]. It is usual to say ''Paris'' not ''Paree''.\"\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939, Churchill's concerns proved justified. The [[escort Group]]s refuelling facilities at Berehaven and Queenstown were {{convert|200|mi}} further west than the nearest ones in Northern Ireland and [[Great Britain]]. To compensate for the distance, allied convoys from North America had to be routed via [[Iceland]] to the ports in Northern Ireland in the early months of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. However, this decision arguably proved more practical because the shorter sea lanes around Ireland's southern coast soon became vulnerable to German anti-shipping air attacks following the [[fall of France]] in June 1940. The Iceland route also provided adequate air cover and escort refuelling for allied convoys. Nevertheless, many in the [[Royal Navy]] felt resentment towards the handover of the Irish Treaty Ports because they would have provided cover to convoys heading south to [[Gibraltar]] and [[North Africa]].<ref>See [[Nicholas Monsarrat]]'s ''[[The Cruel Sea (novel)|The Cruel Sea]]''.</ref>\n\nFormerly, when the country was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the Royal Navy had designated its ''Ireland Station'' as a long-standing separate command.<ref>Archives on the \"Ireland Station\" are held at the [[Public Record Office]] in [[Kew]]; [see http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=251&CATLN=3&accessmethod=5]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Statement relating to Defence]] (UK White Paper, 1935, initiating rearmament).\n* [[Irish neutrality during World War II]]\n**[[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]\n** [[Donegal Corridor]]\n* [[Irish Naval Service]]\n* [[Plan W]]\n* [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.difp.ie/docs/1938/British-Irish-tripartite-agreement-on-trade-finance-and-defence/2321.htm British-Irish tripartite agreement on Trade, Finance and Defence, 1938]\n* [http://treaty.nationalarchives.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Anglo-Irish-Treaty.pdf Anglo-Irish Treaty, 1921]\n\n[[Category:Irish Free State]]\n[[Category:Ireland and the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n[[Category:Former exclaves]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Irish English|date=March 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n\nFollowing the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]], three deep water '''Treaty Ports''' ({{Lang-ga|Calafoirt an Chonartha}}<ref>https://www.examinations.ie/tmp/1544124572_6866105.pdf</ref>) at [[Castletownbere|Berehaven]], Queenstown (modern [[C\u00f3bh]]) and [[Lough Swilly]] were retained by the [[United Kingdom]] in accordance with the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 6 December 1921.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/anglo_irish/dfaexhib2.html Text of Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921]</ref> \n[[File:Treaty Ports (Ireland).png|thumb|right|250px|Location of the Treaty Ports in the Irish Free State, renamed Ireland in 1937 (1922\u20131938)]]\n\nThe main reason for the retention of the ports was the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-boat Campaign]] around Irish coasts during [[World War I]] and the concern of the British government that it might recur.

The troops were formed up around the flagstaff and Mr. de Valera ran up the tricolour national flag of Eire over Westmoreland Fort to the accompaniment of a salute of 21 guns. As the flag was broken there were cheers, re-echoed by the thousands gathered on the mainland. Simultaneously the flag was saluted at barracks in Dublin, the [[Curragh]], [[Athlone]], and other military centres. The warship H.M.S. [[HMS Acasta (H09)|Acasta]], which has been in the port on duty, left about the time the Innisfallen sailed, and both were well out to sea by the time the Irish flag was hoisted on the island.<ref>''The Times'', 12 July 1938</ref>}}\n\nThe invitations to the Irish handover celebration read as follows:<ref>Source: Photographic exhibition on Spike Island itself (2011)</ref>\n\n{{quotation|The Minister for Defence on behalf of the Government of Ireland requests the honour of the company of XXX on the occasion of the handing over of the Cobh Harbour Defences and the raising of the National Flag at Spike Island, Cobh, Co.

The ceremony at Dunree was witnessed by only a dozen spectators. The [[Union Jack]], was hauled down by two Royal Artillery N.C.O.s and the Eire green, white, and orange flag was run up by two N.C.O.s of the Coastal Artillery Defence Force. The ceremony was brought forward from October 26, the date originally fixed under the Anglo-Irish Pact, on account of the international situation. When the British troops left last evening en route for Shoeburyness, their new headquarters, they were given a cordial send off. By a coincidence Sergeant O'Flynn, of the Royal Artillery, who hauled down the Union Jack, and Sergeant McLaughlin, of the Eire force, who hoisted the tricolour, are brothers-in-law.<ref>''The Times'', 4 October 1938</ref>}}\n\n==British dissent ==\nFollowing the agreement to handover the Treaty Ports to the Irish Free State, [[Winston Churchill]] was one of only a few MPs who were critical of the decision. In 1938 he addressed the UK's [[House of Commons]] calling it a \"folly\":\n\n{{quotation|\n:When I read this Agreement in the newspapers a week ago I was filled with surprise. On the face of it, we seem to give everything away and receive nothing in return...But then I supposed there was another side to the Agreement, and that we were to be granted some facilities and rights in Southern Ireland in time of war. That, I notice, was the view taken by a part of the Press, but soon Mr. de Valera in the D\u00e1il made it clear that he was under no obligations of any kind and, as the Prime Minister confirmed ...On the contrary, Mr. de Valera has not even abandoned his claim for the incorporation of Ulster...\n\n:We are told that we have ended the age-long quarrel between England and Ireland, but that is clearly not true, because Mr. de Valera has said that he will never rest until Partition is swept away. Therefore, the real conflict has yet to come...[The Anglo-Irish] Treaty has been kept in the letter and the spirit by Great Britain, but the Treaty has been violated and repudiated in every detail by Mr. de Valera....The ports in question, Queenstown, Berehaven and Lough Swilly, are to be handed over unconditionally, with no guarantees of any kind, as a gesture of our trust and goodwill, as the Prime Minister said, to the Government of the Irish Republic.\n\n:When the Irish Treaty was being shaped in 1922 I was instructed by the Cabinet to prepare that part of the Agreement which dealt with strategic reservations. I negotiated with Mr. Michael Collins, and I was advised by Admiral Beatty...The Admiralty of those days assured me that without the use of these ports it would be very difficult, perhaps almost impossible, to feed this Island in time of war. Queenstown and Berehaven shelter the flotillas which keep clear the approaches to the [[Bristol Channel|Bristol]] and [[English Channel]]s, and Lough Swilly is the base from which the access to the [[River Mersey|Mersey]] and the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] is covered...If we are denied the use of Lough Swilly and have to work from Lamlash, we should strike 200 miles from the effective radius of our flotillas, out and home; and if we are denied Berehaven and Queenstown, and have to work from [[Pembroke Dock]], we should strike 400 miles from their effective radius out and home. These ports are, in fact, the sentinel towers of the western approaches, by which the 45,000,000 people in this Island so enormously depend on foreign food for their daily bread, and by which they can carry on their trade, which is equally important to their existence.\n\n:In 1922 the Irish delegates made no difficulty about this. They saw that it was vital to our safety that we should be able to use these ports and, therefore, the matter passed into the structure of the Treaty without any serious controversy. Now we are to give them up, unconditionally, to an Irish Government led by men I do not want to use hard words whose rise to power has been proportionate to the animosity with which they have acted against this country, no doubt in pursuance of their own patriotic impulses, and whose present position in power is based upon the violation of solemn Treaty engagements.\n\n:But what guarantee have you that Southern Ireland, or the Irish Republic, as they claim to be and you do not contradict them will not declare neutrality if we are engaged in war with some powerful nation? Under this Agreement, it seems to me...that Mr. de Valera\u2019s Government will at some supreme moment of emergency demand the surrender of Ulster as an alternative to declaring neutrality.\n\n:Mr. de Valera has given no undertaking, except to fight against Partition as the main object of his life. It would be a serious step for a Dublin Government to attack these forts while they are in our possession and while we have the right to occupy them. It would be an easy step for a Dublin Government to deny their use to us once we have gone...You are casting away real and important means of security and survival for vain shadows and for ease.}}\n\nChurchill also remarked that the concessions under the Agreements of 1938 were \"astonishing triumphs\" for Irish leader, \u00c9amon de Valera. Churchill also asked would it not be \"far better to give up the \u00a310,000,000 [a one-off Irish payment under the Agreement], and acquire the legal right, be it only on a lease granted by treaty, to use these harbours when necessary?\" Mr Churchill also made a remark concerning the name by which the Irish state would henceforth be described in the UK (Eire) \u2013 \"I have not been able to form a clear opinion on the exact juridical position of the Government of that portion of Ireland called Southern Ireland, which is now called Eire. That is a word which really has no application at the present time, and I must say, even from the point of view of the ordinary uses of English, that it is not customary to quote a term in a foreign language, a capital town, a geographical place, when there exists a perfectly well-known English equivalent [Ireland]. It is usual to say ''Paris'' not ''Paree''.\"\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939, Churchill's concerns proved justified. The [[escort Group]]s refuelling facilities at Berehaven and Queenstown were {{convert|200|mi}} further west than the nearest ones in Northern Ireland and [[Great Britain]]. To compensate for the distance, allied convoys from North America had to be routed via [[Iceland]] to the ports in Northern Ireland in the early months of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. However, this decision arguably proved more practical because the shorter sea lanes around Ireland's southern coast soon became vulnerable to German anti-shipping air attacks following the [[fall of France]] in June 1940. The Iceland route also provided adequate air cover and escort refuelling for allied convoys. Nevertheless, many in the [[Royal Navy]] felt resentment towards the handover of the Irish Treaty Ports because they would have provided cover to convoys heading south to [[Gibraltar]] and [[North Africa]].<ref>See [[Nicholas Monsarrat]]'s ''[[The Cruel Sea (novel)|The Cruel Sea]]''.</ref>\n\nFormerly, when the country was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the Royal Navy had designated its ''Ireland Station'' as a long-standing separate command.<ref>Archives on the \"Ireland Station\" are held at the [[Public Record Office]] in [[Kew]]; [see http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=251&CATLN=3&accessmethod=5]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Statement relating to Defence]] (UK White Paper, 1935, initiating rearmament).\n* [[Irish neutrality during World War II]]\n**[[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]\n** [[Donegal Corridor]]\n* [[Irish Naval Service]]\n* [[Plan W]]\n* [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.difp.ie/docs/1938/British-Irish-tripartite-agreement-on-trade-finance-and-defence/2321.htm British-Irish tripartite agreement on Trade, Finance and Defence, 1938]\n* [http://treaty.nationalarchives.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Anglo-Irish-Treaty.pdf Anglo-Irish Treaty, 1921]\n\n[[Category:Irish Free State]]\n[[Category:Ireland and the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n[[Category:Former exclaves]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Ports_(Ireland)"}

A multi-instrumentalist,<ref name=\"carl\"/> he has stated he didn't write much music when he was younger, becoming a singer-songwriter only later in his life.<ref name=\"carl\"/> He began attending the College of Fine Arts at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1994, where he majored in music performance.<ref name=\"ut\"/>\n\nAfter graduating in 1998 he moved from [[Austin, Texas]] to [[Brooklyn, New York]]. He began working at [[EMI Music Publishing]] after winning the first internship with the Joni Abbott Foundation. People involved in the internship included executives Rick Krim and Evan Lamberg at EMI, Don Henley, [[Tom Freston]] of [[MTV]], and John Sykes of [[VH1]], who started the Save The Music Foundation.<ref name=\"voicee\"/>\n\nHe met his wife, Jaime Herbeck, in April 2006.

He created his own 9x9 foot studio in his apartment, and used<ref name=\"ecr\"/> a homebuilt computer, two cheap monitors, a [[condensor microphone]], an electric and acoustic guitar, a bass guitar, a keyboard, two amplifiers, and a [[drum machine]] to begin creating an album.<ref name=\"carl\"/> He borrowed an amp from friend and neighbor [[Shara Worden]], who had previously given him vocal lessons. They had also shared band members in earlier groups, including Konrad Meissner, who now plays with [[Matt Nathanson]].\n\nCloyd's homemade recordings were discovered by [[Blake Morgan]] of [[ECR Music Group]] (Engine Company Records).<ref name=\"ecr\"/> Morgan began helping set deadlines for Cloyd to finish tracks in his home studio, and began mixing the recordings.

''Unhand Me, You Fiend!'' jumps between folky, [[Jeff Buckley]]-esque ballads, minor-key raucous indie-guitar workouts and, errr, a Radiohead cover (that's actually quite great!). It seems the work of a single, quirky mind with a lot of time on its hands \u2014 and it's a joy to listen to.\"<ref name=\"emusic\"/>\n\n[[Melodic.net]] gave it 4/4 stars and wrote \"New talent David Cloyd...offers a stylish and at times complex pop journey. With floating melodies built with acoustic elements and technical details... if you like cool pop in a slightly odd and very personal style, this is a must album.\"<ref name=\"melodic\"/>\n\n===''I Could Disappear'' (2010)===\nOn June 29, 2010,<ref name=\"allicou\"/> Cloyd released his second album, ''[[I Could Disappear]].'' The nine studio tracks are all solo reworkings of the original pop and rock songs from his debut album.<ref name=\"carl\"/> According to Cloyd, \"With each song boiled down to its essence I discovered something exciting\u2014working with less demands more from you as an artist.\"<ref name=\"ecr\"/> He performed vocals, alternating with piano and electric guitar. He also engineered the album and created the album cover.<ref name=\"allicou\"/>\n\n===''Dear Boy'' (2011)===\nCloyd released a cover of [[Paul McCartney]]'s 1971 song \"[[Dear Boy (song)|Dear Boy]]\" on September 13, 2011.

''Unhand Me, You Fiend!'' jumps between folky, [[Jeff Buckley]]-esque ballads, minor-key raucous indie-guitar workouts and, errr, a Radiohead cover (that's actually quite great!). It seems the work of a single, quirky mind with a lot of time on its hands \u2014 and it's a joy to listen to.\"<ref name=\"emusic\"/>\n\n[[Melodic.net]] gave it 4/4 stars and wrote \"New talent David Cloyd...offers a stylish and at times complex pop journey. With floating melodies built with acoustic elements and technical details... if you like cool pop in a slightly odd and very personal style, this is a must album.\"<ref name=\"melodic\"/>\n\n===''I Could Disappear'' (2010)===\nOn June 29, 2010,<ref name=\"allicou\"/> Cloyd released his second album, ''[[I Could Disappear]].''

He also engineered the album and created the album cover.<ref name=\"allicou\"/>\n\n===''Dear Boy'' (2011)===\nCloyd released a cover of [[Paul McCartney]]'s 1971 song \"[[Dear Boy (song)|Dear Boy]]\" on September 13, 2011.

Lee explains that she gave the egg to Dr. Noah Blackwood, a conservationist who is known for his animal theme parks and appearances on television shows.<ref name=\"powells\"/> Although Blackwood appears to be sweet and caring, he is later revealed to be a ruthless collector and harvester of rare animals,<ref name=\"powells\"/> so Lee has stolen the egg back, but has left her field notes in Blackwood\u2019s lab. Wolfe assembles a team to head to the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]]<ref name=\"literatemother\"/> to contact his local friend Masalito and to find the Mok\u00e9l\u00e9-mbemb\u00e9 before Blackwood gets there. They plan to send Marty and Grace back to boarding school on the same flight.\n\nDuring the flight, Marty frees Bo, a chimpanzee, from his cage, and they have to find him. Marty and Grace follow Bo down a supply chute in the cargo bay, and discover that both Bo and PD, a [[Teacup Poodle|teacup poodle]], are down there.  The chute opens, and they are [[air drop]]ped into the Congo jungle.<ref name=\"kirkus\"/> Marty uses a device called a Gizmo to find Grace and their animal companions. Wolfe contacts Marty and directs them to a [[tree house|sky house]] by [[Lake Tele|Lake T\u00e9l\u00e9]], but Wolfe's group will not be able to reach there for a week. He explains that they need to avoid Butch McCall, Blackwood's top henchman,<ref name=\"literatemother\"/> and instructs them on how to contact Masalito by using a [[Baka music|molimo]]. Butch spots the children, and reports back to Blackwood, who tells him to find the girl. Butch steals the Gizmo and impersonates Marty in his communications with Wolfe. Grace and Marty eventually reach the sky house, but when Marty leaves briefly to fetch a pack, Grace faints and knocks herself unconscious; Butch and his men abduct her.\n\nMarty calls Masalito with the molimo, and they manage to communicate. Marty realizes Butch has kidnapped Grace. The twins discover that Grace is actually Wolfe's daughter, and Blackwood's granddaughter (Wolfe married Blackwood's daughter and had Marty's parents take care of Grace).<ref name=\"powells\"/> Grace, who has had nightmares of various events throughout the story, realizes some of her dreams are actually memories. Wolfe tells Lee that Mok\u00e9l\u00e9-mbemb\u00e9 had killed Grace's mother and tore his leg. Wolfe also becomes suspicious of Marty's communications.\n\nAs Marty and Masalito search for Grace, Wolfe and Lee spot a note through Bo's video camera feed. They realize that Butch is hunting them, so they ditch their possible tracking devices. Meanwhile, Grace gives first aid to one of Butch's men who was injured by a silverback gorilla. She later drugs their food and tries to escape while the men are sleeping. One of the men stays awake long enough to alert the others to follow her.\n\nMarty finds Butch and attacks him. He takes back the Gizmo, and throws Butch's boots into the swamp. He catches up to Grace, and they rush into a tunnel of trees. They find the body of Mok\u00e9l\u00e9-mbemb\u00e9, which Wolfe directs them to burn. They recover its eggs from a nest, and return to the sky house, however, Blackwood and Butch lie in wait. Marty rushes upstairs; Grace follows but is stopped by Butch, who ties her up and is about to put her into Blackwood's helicopter. Marty has Butch and Blackwood hand over Grace by tossing one of the eggs (actually a fake, a ball with motor oil). Lee and Wolfe arrive at the clearing. With Blackwood's helicopter, they fly home to Cryptos.\n\n==Reception==\nA [[Kirkus Reviews|''Kirkus'' magazine review]] described the story as \"a B-movie with email\".  The \"enjoyably rollicking adventures are appropriately cheesy; the stereotypes, though equally fitting, are a bit much.\"<ref name=\"kirkus\"/> Author Wendy Sparrow wrote that \"the book was like the [[Magic Tree House series|''Magic Treehouse'']] kids all grown up and taking on [[Jurassic Park (franchise)|''Jurassic Park'']] or ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]''.\" She enjoyed Grace and Marty's \"fun and real\" personalities.

Lee explains that she gave the egg to Dr. Noah Blackwood, a conservationist who is known for his animal theme parks and appearances on television shows.<ref name=\"powells\"/> Although Blackwood appears to be sweet and caring, he is later revealed to be a ruthless collector and harvester of rare animals,<ref name=\"powells\"/> so Lee has stolen the egg back, but has left her field notes in Blackwood\u2019s lab. Wolfe assembles a team to head to the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]]<ref name=\"literatemother\"/> to contact his local friend Masalito and to find the Mok\u00e9l\u00e9-mbemb\u00e9 before Blackwood gets there. They plan to send Marty and Grace back to boarding school on the same flight.\n\nDuring the flight, Marty frees Bo, a chimpanzee, from his cage, and they have to find him. Marty and Grace follow Bo down a supply chute in the cargo bay, and discover that both Bo and PD, a [[Teacup Poodle|teacup poodle]], are down there.  The chute opens, and they are [[air drop]]ped into the Congo jungle.<ref name=\"kirkus\"/> Marty uses a device called a Gizmo to find Grace and their animal companions. Wolfe contacts Marty and directs them to a [[tree house|sky house]] by [[Lake Tele|Lake T\u00e9l\u00e9]], but Wolfe's group will not be able to reach there for a week. He explains that they need to avoid Butch McCall, Blackwood's top henchman,<ref name=\"literatemother\"/> and instructs them on how to contact Masalito by using a [[Baka music|molimo]]. Butch spots the children, and reports back to Blackwood, who tells him to find the girl. Butch steals the Gizmo and impersonates Marty in his communications with Wolfe. Grace and Marty eventually reach the sky house, but when Marty leaves briefly to fetch a pack, Grace faints and knocks herself unconscious; Butch and his men abduct her.\n\nMarty calls Masalito with the molimo, and they manage to communicate. Marty realizes Butch has kidnapped Grace. The twins discover that Grace is actually Wolfe's daughter, and Blackwood's granddaughter (Wolfe married Blackwood's daughter and had Marty's parents take care of Grace).<ref name=\"powells\"/> Grace, who has had nightmares of various events throughout the story, realizes some of her dreams are actually memories. Wolfe tells Lee that Mok\u00e9l\u00e9-mbemb\u00e9 had killed Grace's mother and tore his leg. Wolfe also becomes suspicious of Marty's communications.\n\nAs Marty and Masalito search for Grace, Wolfe and Lee spot a note through Bo's video camera feed. They realize that Butch is hunting them, so they ditch their possible tracking devices. Meanwhile, Grace gives first aid to one of Butch's men who was injured by a silverback gorilla. She later drugs their food and tries to escape while the men are sleeping. One of the men stays awake long enough to alert the others to follow her.\n\nMarty finds Butch and attacks him. He takes back the Gizmo, and throws Butch's boots into the swamp. He catches up to Grace, and they rush into a tunnel of trees. They find the body of Mok\u00e9l\u00e9-mbemb\u00e9, which Wolfe directs them to burn. They recover its eggs from a nest, and return to the sky house, however, Blackwood and Butch lie in wait. Marty rushes upstairs; Grace follows but is stopped by Butch, who ties her up and is about to put her into Blackwood's helicopter. Marty has Butch and Blackwood hand over Grace by tossing one of the eggs (actually a fake, a ball with motor oil). Lee and Wolfe arrive at the clearing. With Blackwood's helicopter, they fly home to Cryptos.\n\n==Reception==\nA [[Kirkus Reviews|''Kirkus'' magazine review]] described the story as \"a B-movie with email\".  The \"enjoyably rollicking adventures are appropriately cheesy; the stereotypes, though equally fitting, are a bit much.\"<ref name=\"kirkus\"/> Author Wendy Sparrow wrote that \"the book was like the [[Magic Tree House series|''Magic Treehouse'']] kids all grown up and taking on [[Jurassic Park (franchise)|''Jurassic Park'']] or ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]''.\" She enjoyed Grace and Marty's \"fun and real\" personalities.

Debuting with the eponymous title ''Clementine'' in 2006, the seven books in the series follow the eccentric and lovable, yet unintentionally devious, eight-year-old Clementine through third grade.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gross|first1=Claire|title=Sara Pennypacker on Completely Clementine|url=http://www.hbook.com/2015/03/authors-illustrators/sara-pennypacker-on-completely-clementine/|website=The Horn Book|accessdate=16 June 2017|quote=Clementine made it through third grade, she\u2019s going to be just fine, but she doesn\u2019t need me to tell her story anymore\u2026}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nThe books are focused on an eight-year-old, artistic, but impulsive girl named Clementine, characterized by her flaming red curls. In spite of her good but misunderstood intentions, she frequently finds herself being sent to the principal's office for her lack of cooperation and characteristic imperfections. Other characters include Clementine's loving, understanding parents, her unnamed younger brother (labelled with a vast assortment of nicknames relating to vegetables by his elder sister), her sister Summer, her pet kitten Moisturizer, and Margaret, Clementine's strict, partially stuck-up, but kindhearted best friend. The books are set in [[Boston]].\n\n==Characters==\n\n'''Clementine,''' The main protagonist of the series; a kind, gifted, artistic, but impulsive and unpredictable little girl characterized by her multiple personality quirks. Albeit her intentions are good, she is commonly misunderstood by many authority figures around her and often finds herself being sent to the principal's office. Unintentionally troublemaking, but childishly innocent, Clementine frequently brings up her love of [[gorilla]]s and her desire to own one someday as a pet. She possesses artistic talent and loves to draw, and her drawings are frequently shown throughout the course of the series.\n\n'''Margaret,''' Clementine's closest friend, who is depicted as being a year older than she is. She often shows little tolerance for Clementine's eccentricities and enjoys domineering other people, particularly those younger than she (who she perceives as being of lesser authority than she is), and shows a few uptight and snobbish personality traits (she enjoys showing off). However, she is overall a good friend and has performed great acts of kindness on Clementine's behalf before in the past. She has a baseball-loving teenage brother named Mitchell, who makes frequent appearances throughout the course of the series. In the first title, Clementine cuts off a majority of Margaret's hair, resulting in a rather disastrous week at school for her.\n\n'''Mitchell,''' Mitchell is the name of Margaret's adolescent older brother; an enthusiast of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Depicted with a comical sense of humor, he enjoys teasing Margaret frequently and irritating her, and gets along well with Clementine (who believes that he is \"trying to be her boyfriend\"), and he apparently enjoys her company. His sister appears to be easily annoyed with him.\n\n'''Bill,''' Clementine's father, who works as the manager of the apartment building in which a majority of the series's main characters reside. Fun-loving and understanding with his daughter, he enlists Clementine's assistance in fighting off the \"Great Pigeon War\" (finding a method of repelling the pigeons attracted to the stone statues molded into the building), which Clementine successfully resolves, and a celebration is held in her honor at the book's conclusion. Although there have been many occasions where he finds himself being agitated by Clementine's antics, he is quite forgiving. Albeit his wife and little son remain unnamed, Bill's name has been revealed on several occasions.\n\n'''Clementine's Mother,''' Clementine's unnamed mother, an artist. Portrayed as being understanding and kind with her daughter, albeit she, too, has found herself exasperated with examples of poor cooperation on her daughter's part (such as in the debut book of the series, where Clementine somehow finds herself in trouble constantly throughout the course of a single week at school) albeit she's understanding nonetheless. In ''Clementine and the Family Meeting,'' she becomes pregnant, much to Clementine's chagrin.\n\n'''Clementine's Younger Brother,''' Clementine's unnamed younger brother, a toddler. Due to the perceived unfairness of Clementine's \"fruit name\", she labels him with a vast array of nicknames related to vegetables, so because of this his name has never been given. He apparently suffers from a severe peanut allergy and enjoys playing with his own feet.\n\n==Titles==\n# ''Clementine'' (2006), After cutting off most of Margaret's hair, Clementine inadvertently winds up landing herself in multiple punishments at school.\n# ''The Talented Clementine'' (2007), Clementine fears for the upcoming talent competition taking place at her school, as she is unsure of what skill to demonstrate.\n# ''Clementine's Letter'' (2008), When Clementine's teacher is nominated for the reward of an Egyptian archaeology expedition lasting for the remainder of the year if his students write letters explaining why he deserves to be selected, Clementine worries that her teacher will be picked and writes a negative letter.\n# ''Clementine: Friend of the Week'' (2010), Clementine is chosen for the position of \"Friend of the Week\" in her classroom, where her classmates create a book of her positive personality aspects. Her beloved kitten Moisturizer suddenly vanishes, and after seeing Margaret's phenomenal album crafted by her schoolmates, she fears that hers will not be quite as positive.\n# ''Clementine and The Family Meeting'' (2011), Clementine's mother reveals herself to be pregnant, much to her daughter's dismay. Clementine fears for the changes that potentially might be made to her home life as a result to the birth of a new younger sibling.\n# ''Clementine and the Spring Trip'' (2013), Clementine is ready for the school trip to [[Plimoth Plantation]], but is worried about having lunch there, learning Olive-language, and surviving The Cloud on Bus 7. \n# ''Completely Clementine'' (2015), Clementine is not ready for summer, to start speaking to her father again after being mad at him for eating meat, the new baby on the way, or saying good-bye to her third grade teacher.\n\n==Awards==\n*2007: ''Clementine'', [[Boston Globe\u2013Horn Book Award|Boston Globe\u2013Horn Book Honor]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Past Boston Globe\u2013Horn Book Award Winners|url=http://www.hbook.com/2011/05/news/boston-globe-horn-book-awards/past-boston-globe-horn-book-award-winners/|website=The Horn Book|accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n*2007: ''Clementine'', Sid Fleischman Award, SCWBI<ref>{{cite web|title=Sid Fleischman Award Winners|url=http://www.scbwi.org/sid-fleischman-award-winners/|publisher=Society of Children\u2019s Book Writers and Illustrators|accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n*2007: ''Clementine'', [[Josette Frank Award]]\n*2008: ''Clementine'', Rhode Island Children's Book Award<ref>{{cite web|title=Rhode Island Children's Book Award Winners and Nominees 1991-2009|url=http://www.olis.ri.gov/services/children/ricba/ricbawinnersandnomineees.php|website=Office of Library and Information Services|accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n*2009: ''Clementine'', [[William Allen White Children's Book Award]] (Grades 3-5)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n[[Category:Series of children's books]]\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Boston]]\n[[Category:Novels set in schools]]\n[[Category:2006 children's books]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2017}}\n\n{{Infobox book series\n| name             = Clementine\n| image            = <!-- Example.jpg -->\n| image_caption    = \n| books            = \n| author           = [[Sara Pennypacker]]\n| illustrator      = [[Marla Frazee]]\n| cover_artist     = \n| country          = {{USA}}\n| language         = English\n| genre            = [[Realistic fiction]]\n| publisher        = Disney/[[Hyperion Books|Hyperion]]\n| pub_date         = \n| english_pub_date = \n| media_type       = \n| number_of_books  = 7\n| oclc             = \n| preceded by      = \n| followed by      = \n| website          = [http://www.sarapennypacker.com/pennypacker-clementine.htm The Clementine series]\n}}\n\n'''Clementine''' is a series of children's chapter books written by [[Sara Pennypacker]] and illustrated by Marla Frazee.

Unintentionally troublemaking, but childishly innocent, Clementine frequently brings up her love of [[gorilla]]s and her desire to own one someday as a pet. She possesses artistic talent and loves to draw, and her drawings are frequently shown throughout the course of the series.\n\n'''Margaret,''' Clementine's closest friend, who is depicted as being a year older than she is. She often shows little tolerance for Clementine's eccentricities and enjoys domineering other people, particularly those younger than she (who she perceives as being of lesser authority than she is), and shows a few uptight and snobbish personality traits (she enjoys showing off). However, she is overall a good friend and has performed great acts of kindness on Clementine's behalf before in the past. She has a baseball-loving teenage brother named Mitchell, who makes frequent appearances throughout the course of the series. In the first title, Clementine cuts off a majority of Margaret's hair, resulting in a rather disastrous week at school for her.\n\n'''Mitchell,''' Mitchell is the name of Margaret's adolescent older brother; an enthusiast of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Depicted with a comical sense of humor, he enjoys teasing Margaret frequently and irritating her, and gets along well with Clementine (who believes that he is \"trying to be her boyfriend\"), and he apparently enjoys her company. His sister appears to be easily annoyed with him.\n\n'''Bill,''' Clementine's father, who works as the manager of the apartment building in which a majority of the series's main characters reside. Fun-loving and understanding with his daughter, he enlists Clementine's assistance in fighting off the \"Great Pigeon War\" (finding a method of repelling the pigeons attracted to the stone statues molded into the building), which Clementine successfully resolves, and a celebration is held in her honor at the book's conclusion. Although there have been many occasions where he finds himself being agitated by Clementine's antics, he is quite forgiving. Albeit his wife and little son remain unnamed, Bill's name has been revealed on several occasions.\n\n'''Clementine's Mother,''' Clementine's unnamed mother, an artist. Portrayed as being understanding and kind with her daughter, albeit she, too, has found herself exasperated with examples of poor cooperation on her daughter's part (such as in the debut book of the series, where Clementine somehow finds herself in trouble constantly throughout the course of a single week at school) albeit she's understanding nonetheless. In ''Clementine and the Family Meeting,'' she becomes pregnant, much to Clementine's chagrin.\n\n'''Clementine's Younger Brother,''' Clementine's unnamed younger brother, a toddler. Due to the perceived unfairness of Clementine's \"fruit name\", she labels him with a vast array of nicknames related to vegetables, so because of this his name has never been given. He apparently suffers from a severe peanut allergy and enjoys playing with his own feet.\n\n==Titles==\n# ''Clementine'' (2006), After cutting off most of Margaret's hair, Clementine inadvertently winds up landing herself in multiple punishments at school.\n# ''The Talented Clementine'' (2007), Clementine fears for the upcoming talent competition taking place at her school, as she is unsure of what skill to demonstrate.\n# ''Clementine's Letter'' (2008), When Clementine's teacher is nominated for the reward of an Egyptian archaeology expedition lasting for the remainder of the year if his students write letters explaining why he deserves to be selected, Clementine worries that her teacher will be picked and writes a negative letter.\n# ''Clementine: Friend of the Week'' (2010), Clementine is chosen for the position of \"Friend of the Week\" in her classroom, where her classmates create a book of her positive personality aspects.
