The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in Nashville ]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 reaches an elevation of over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} for the first time in Tennessee, before crossing into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]] about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}}.\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. Beyond this point, the Interstate descends into a short depression before crossing into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] and mile 340, entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. Shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit drops to 60&nbsp;mph in the eastbound lanes. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\n[[File:TN I40 East-I75 North West Knoxville.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 concurrent with I-75 in Knoxville]]\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in Nashville ]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 reaches an elevation of over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} for the first time in Tennessee, before crossing into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]] about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}}.\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. Beyond this point, the Interstate descends into a short depression before crossing into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] and mile 340, entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. Shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit drops to 60&nbsp;mph in the eastbound lanes. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\n[[File:TN I40 East-I75 North West Knoxville.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 concurrent with I-75 in Knoxville]]\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

For the first time this series, Return performances were absent for the entire season.\n\nThe season premiered on February 7, 2020 after facing two postponements, one from January 10 due to some episodes clashing with [[Chinese New Year]], and one on January 31 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.sina.com.cn/tv/zy/2020-01-29/doc-iimxxste7519666.shtml|title=\u6e56\u5357\u536b\u89c6\u300a\u6b4c\u624b\u300b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u81f32\u67087\u65e5\u64ad\u51fa|website=Sina|date=2019-01-29|accessdate=2020-01-31}}</ref>. The series will end on the live finale airing April 24, 2020.\n\n==Competition rules==\nLike the previous seasons of ''I Am a Singer'' and ''Singer'', it features five rounds of two stages, Qualifier and Knockout, with seven singers performing for a 500-member audience each week. The [[electronic voting]], first appeared as a pre-voting twist in [[Singer 2018|season six]] and introduced permanently on [[Singer 2019|season seven]], where voting (up to three votes) was conducted throughout the performance and accounted for 50% of the final score. As such for past seasons, the scores from both weeks are combined to decide the eliminated singer who received the fewest votes. Unlike the last season, separate scores for paper and electronic votes are not revealed.\n\nThe competition revert to the pre-[[I Am a Singer (Chinese season 3)|season three]] format with Challenge rounds (a round which featured a new singer requiring to rank in the top four to avoid elimination) removed, but instead replaced with a variant round known as Surprise, which in-turn functions similarities to the Substituted singers as well. Three new singers were introduced at the start of the Qualifier round and along with the managers; while on backstage, the singers watched their performance while seated with a microphone stand lever. During the performance, a contestant may pull the lever to issue a challenge to the current contestant, but any current contestants are not aware from their existence until the performance ended. After the challenger performed, an electronic vote will immediately conduct with the results being revealed afterwards (previously after the episode prior to the first round). All three Surprise challenges do not need to be performed on a single episode, but challengers must challenge to a singer within the current elimination round. If at least one challenger succeed in the Surprise round, one contestant from the current lineup will be eliminated at the end of the current Knockout round; if multiple challengers succeed, a re-vote will conduct between the successful singers and the singer with a higher vote advance will replace the eliminated singer, but all successful singers, regardless if they lose the revote will be guaranteed a place in the Breakout round. If all three challengers were unsuccessful, all seven contestants are safe from elimination itself. The final round features a small change in which the Challengers were reduced to two, and no re-vote was conducted for multiple successful singers, meaning that the singers are immediately advanced to the competition and eliminations are conducted as usual.\n\nAs the season is subtitled ''Year of the Hits'', the contest is suggested for a pool of younger singing talents with an age range of 18 and 35. Contestants are no longer restricted to the songs selection, and may freely choose a song they composed on their own or on someone else. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epaper.bbtnews.com.cn/site1/bjsb/html/2020-01/06/content_442354.htm|title=\u9996\u53d1\u9635\u5bb9\u5f15\u4e89\u8bae \u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9760\u4ec0\u4e48\u201c\u5f53\u6253\u201d |publisher=\u5317\u4eac\u5546\u62a5|author1=\u5362\u626c|author2=\u4f0d\u78a7\u6021|date=2020-01-06|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following ''Singer 2020'' contestants are listed in alphabetical order.

For the first time this series, Return performances were absent for the entire season.\n\nThe season premiered on February 7, 2020 after facing two postponements, one from January 10 due to some episodes clashing with [[Chinese New Year]], and one on January 31 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.sina.com.cn/tv/zy/2020-01-29/doc-iimxxste7519666.shtml|title=\u6e56\u5357\u536b\u89c6\u300a\u6b4c\u624b\u300b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u81f32\u67087\u65e5\u64ad\u51fa|website=Sina|date=2019-01-29|accessdate=2020-01-31}}</ref>. The series will end on the live finale airing April 24, 2020.\n\n==Competition rules==\nLike the previous seasons of ''I Am a Singer'' and ''Singer'', it features five rounds of two stages, Qualifier and Knockout, with seven singers performing for a 500-member audience each week. The [[electronic voting]], first appeared as a pre-voting twist in [[Singer 2018|season six]] and introduced permanently on [[Singer 2019|season seven]], where voting (up to three votes) was conducted throughout the performance and accounted for 50% of the final score. As such for past seasons, the scores from both weeks are combined to decide the eliminated singer who received the fewest votes. Unlike the last season, separate scores for paper and electronic votes are not revealed.\n\nThe competition revert to the pre-[[I Am a Singer (Chinese season 3)|season three]] format with Challenge rounds (a round which featured a new singer requiring to rank in the top four to avoid elimination) removed, but instead replaced with a variant round known as Surprise, which in-turn functions similarities to the Substituted singers as well. Three new singers were introduced at the start of the Qualifier round and along with the managers; while on backstage, the singers watched their performance while seated with a microphone stand lever. During the performance, a contestant may pull the lever to issue a challenge to the current contestant, but any current contestants are not aware from their existence until the performance ended. After the challenger performed, an electronic vote will immediately conduct with the results being revealed afterwards (previously after the episode prior to the first round). All three Surprise challenges do not need to be performed on a single episode, but challengers must challenge to a singer within the current elimination round. If at least one challenger succeed in the Surprise round, one contestant from the current lineup will be eliminated at the end of the current Knockout round; if multiple challengers succeed, a re-vote will conduct between the successful singers and the singer with a higher vote advance will replace the eliminated singer, but all successful singers, regardless if they lose the revote will be guaranteed a place in the Breakout round. If all three challengers were unsuccessful, all seven contestants are safe from elimination itself. The final round features a small change in which the Challengers were reduced to two, and no re-vote was conducted for multiple successful singers, meaning that the singers are immediately advanced to the competition and eliminations are conducted as usual.\n\nAs the season is subtitled ''Year of the Hits'', the contest is suggested for a pool of younger singing talents with an age range of 18 and 35. Contestants are no longer restricted to the songs selection, and may freely choose a song they composed on their own or on someone else. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epaper.bbtnews.com.cn/site1/bjsb/html/2020-01/06/content_442354.htm|title=\u9996\u53d1\u9635\u5bb9\u5f15\u4e89\u8bae \u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9760\u4ec0\u4e48\u201c\u5f53\u6253\u201d |publisher=\u5317\u4eac\u5546\u62a5|author1=\u5362\u626c|author2=\u4f0d\u78a7\u6021|date=2020-01-06|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following ''Singer 2020'' contestants are listed in alphabetical order.

At the top of the photo, the word 'Fulham' is spelt out in white lettering on the black seats.]]\nThis article shows the record of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham Football Club]] against each of the Football League clubs they have played against in all four divisions since 1907.\nFulham's first competitive match was against Maidenhead United on September 10th 1898 in the Southern League but by September 3rd 1907 they had been promoted to the Football League Division Two. Their first match was a home defeat by Hull City. Apart from a brief spell of four seasons in Division 3 (S) they stayed in League Division 2 until promoted to the (old) Division One for the first time in 1949. A memorable F.A.Cup run in 1975 saw them play West Ham United in the final at Wembley, losing 0-2. Tough times were ahead in the late '80s/early '90s when they slipped to next to bottom of the old Third Division at one time. But by 2001 Fulham were promoted to the Top Division, The Premiership.\n\nThen followed a decade of top flight football at Craven Cottage in the Premiership, once finishing in 7th place. But it wasn't going to last forever as they were relegated to the new Championship in 2014 for a few seasons, but after being promoted to the Premiership (again) via the play-offs in May 2018, Fulham had a tough time throughout the 2018-2019 season and after two managerial changes, were relegated after that one season in May 2019. The popular ex midfield player Scott Parker was appointed manager in May and the club looks forward to a return to the Premiership, in due course. However, it is still uncertain what will happen with the aborted season's results for 2019-2020.\n\n==Key==\n*The records include the results of matches played in [[The Football League]] only (1907-2019). Wartime matches are regarded as unofficial and are excluded, as are matches from the abandoned 1939\u201340 season. F.A.Cup games, Championship Play-Off matches and Test Matches are not included, and matches in the [[Southern Football League]] (1899 to 1907) are not included because records are hard to locate.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pre-League |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/history/pre-league |publisher=Fulham Football Club |accessdate=13 November 2012}}</ref>\n*For the sake of simplicity, present-day names are used throughout: for example, results against Ardwick, Small Heath and Woolwich Arsenal are integrated into the records against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], respectively.\n*P = matches played; W = matches won; D = matches drawn; L = matches lost; F = Goals scored; A = Goals conceded; % Performance = percentage of total points won.\n'''Information up to date at the close of the 2018-2019 season and to be updated at end of the following season'''. \n\nFULHAM'S RECORD AGAINST OTHER FOOTBALL LEAGUE CLUBS <ref>Fulham - A Complete Record Dennis Turner & Alex White (updated by David Shrimpton May 2019)</ref>\n\nAlthough formed in 1879, Fulham were not elected to the Football League until 1907. \nThey have played 106 clubs in the Football League since 1907-1908.

At the top of the photo, the word 'Fulham' is spelt out in white lettering on the black seats.]]\nThis article shows the record of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham Football Club]] against each of the Football League clubs they have played against in all four divisions since 1907.\nFulham's first competitive match was against Maidenhead United on September 10th 1898 in the Southern League but by September 3rd 1907 they had been promoted to the Football League Division Two. Their first match was a home defeat by Hull City. Apart from a brief spell of four seasons in Division 3 (S) they stayed in League Division 2 until promoted to the (old) Division One for the first time in 1949. A memorable F.A.Cup run in 1975 saw them play West Ham United in the final at Wembley, losing 0-2. Tough times were ahead in the late '80s/early '90s when they slipped to next to bottom of the old Third Division at one time. But by 2001 Fulham were promoted to the Top Division, The Premiership.\n\nThen followed a decade of top flight football at Craven Cottage in the Premiership, once finishing in 7th place. But it wasn't going to last forever as they were relegated to the new Championship in 2014 for a few seasons, but after being promoted to the Premiership (again) via the play-offs in May 2018, Fulham had a tough time throughout the 2018-2019 season and after two managerial changes, were relegated after that one season in May 2019. The popular ex midfield player Scott Parker was appointed manager in May and the club looks forward to a return to the Premiership, in due course. However, it is still uncertain what will happen with the aborted season's results for 2019-2020.\n\n==Key==\n*The records include the results of matches played in [[The Football League]] only (1907-2019).
