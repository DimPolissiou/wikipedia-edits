Such a disintegration may be relatively abrupt, as in the case of [[Classic Maya collapse|Maya civilization]], or gradual, as in the case of the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]].\n\nThe subject of societal collapse is of interest in such fields as [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], and, more recently, [[cliodynamics]]<ref>{{cite news | last = Pasha-Robinson | first = Lucy | title = 'Society could end in less than a decade,' predicts academic  | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | date = 7 January 2017 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/society-end-western-world-apocalypse-researcher-cliodynamics-political-turmoil-a7515156.html | accessdate = 21 May 2019 }}</ref> and [[complex systems|complex-systems]] science.\n\n== Causes of collapse ==\nCommon factors that may contribute to societal collapse are economical, environmental, social and cultural, and disruptions in one domain sometimes [[domino effect|cascade]] into another. In some cases a natural disaster (e.g. [[tsunami]], [[earthquake]], massive fire or climate change) may precipitate a collapse. Other factors such as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] or [[resource depletion]] might be the proximate cause of collapse. Significant inequity and exposed corruption may combine with lack of loyalty to established political institutions and result in an oppressed lower class rising up and seizing power from a smaller wealthy elite in a [[revolution]]. The diversity of forms that societies evolve corresponds to diversity in their failures. [[Jared Diamond]] suggests that societies have also collapsed through [[deforestation]], loss of soil fertility, [[protectionism|restrictions of trade]] and/or rising endemic violence.<ref>Diamond, Jared \"Collapse: Why some societies succeed and others fail\"</ref>\n\n===Black Swan event===\n\nIn many instances of rapid collapse, a major event will tend to precede its collapse. \n\nThis major event is called a [[black swan event]], because although initially overlooked, it becomes evident in hindsight once the collapse occurs.\n\nSuch a black swan event could be an unnecessary war that overburdens the society's treasury (as in the case of the [[Weimar Republic]] or [[French Revolution|Pre-revolution]] [[French Monarchy]]) or unsustainable [[resource depletion]].\n\n===Foreign invasions===\n[[File:Bronze-age-collapse.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A map of the [[Bronze Age collapse]]]]\n{{See also|Bond event}}\n\nThe decline of the [[Roman Empire]] is one of the events traditionally marking the end of [[Classical Antiquity]] and the beginning of the European [[Middle Ages]]. Throughout the 5th century, the Empire's territories in western Europe and northwestern Africa, including Italy, fell to various invading or indigenous peoples in what is sometimes called the [[Barbarian invasions]], although the eastern half still survived with borders essentially intact for another two centuries (until the [[Muslim conquests|Arab expansion]]). This view of the collapse of the Roman Empire is challenged, however, by modern historians who see Rome as merely transforming from the Western Empire into barbarian kingdoms as the Western Emperors delegated themselves out of existence, and the East transforming into the [[Byzantine Empire]], which only fell in 1453 AD.\n\n[[North Africa]]'s populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the [[Bedouin]] tribes of [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]].<ref>[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=461 The Great Mosque of Tlemcen], MuslimHeritage.com</ref> [[Ibn Khaldun]] noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.<ref>[http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm Populations Crises and Population Cycles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527170154/http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm |date=2013-05-27 }}, Claire Russell and W.M.S.

In cases of collapse, civilizations tend to revert to less complex, less centralized socio-political forms using simpler technology. These are characteristics of a [[Dark Ages in history|Dark Age]]. Examples of such societal collapse are: the [[Hittite Empire]], the [[Mycenaean civilization]], the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Mauryan]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] Empires in India, the [[Mayas]], the [[Angkor]] in Cambodia, the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties in China and the [[Mali Empire]].\n\n'''Incorporation/Absorption''': Alternately, a society may be gradually incorporated into a more dynamic, more complex inter-regional social structure. This happened in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and [[Levant|Levantine cultures]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Delhi Sultanate]]s in India, [[Song Dynasty|Song China]], the [[Aztec]] culture in Mesoamerica, the [[Inca]] culture in South America, and the modern civilizations of China, Japan, and India, as well as many modern states in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n'''Obliteration''': Vast numbers of people in the society die, or the birth rate plunges to a level that causes a dramatic depopulation.\n\nOther changes that may accompany a collapse:\n\n* '''Destratification''': Complex societies stratified on the basis of class, gender, race or some other salient factor become much more homogeneous or horizontally structured. In many cases past social stratification slowly becomes irrelevant following collapse and societies become more egalitarian.\n* '''Despecialization''': One of the most characteristic features of complex civilizations (and in many cases the yardstick to measure complexity) is a high level of [[division of labor|job specialization]]. The most complex societies are characterized by artisans and tradespeople who specialize intensely in a given task. Indeed, the rulers of many past societies were hyper-specialized priests or priestesses who were completely supported by the work of the lower classes. During societal collapse, the social institutions supporting such specialization are removed and people tend to become more generalized in their work and daily habits.\n* '''Decentralization''': As power becomes decentralized, people tend to be more self-regimented and have many more personal freedoms. In many instances of collapse, there is a slackening of social rules and etiquette. Geographically speaking, communities become more parochial or isolated. For example, following the [[Classic Maya collapse|collapse of the Maya civilization]], many Maya returned to their traditional hamlets, moving away from the large cities that had dominated the political landscape.\n* '''Destructuralization''': Institutions, processes, and artifacts are all manifest in the archaeological record in abundance in large civilizations. After collapse, evidence of epiphenomena, institutions, and types of artifacts change dramatically as people are forced to adopt more self-sufficient lifestyles.\n* '''Depopulation''': Societal collapse is almost always associated with a [[population decline]]. In extreme cases, the collapse in population is so severe that the society disappears entirely, such as happened with the [[History of Greenland|Greenland Vikings]], or a number of [[Polynesia]]n islands. In less extreme cases, populations are reduced until a [[demography|demographic balance]] is re-established between human societies and the depleted [[natural environment]]. A classic example is the city of [[History of Rome|Rome]], which had a population of about 1.5 million at the peak of the [[Roman Empire]] during the reign of [[Trajan]] in the early 2nd century AD, but in the [[Early Middle Ages]] the population had declined to only around 15,000 inhabitants by the 9th century.\n* '''Decadence''': [[John Bagot Glubb|Sir John Glubb Pasha]] (1897-1987), a British military officer and historian in his essay, 'Fate of Empires' said most empires will tend to experience an age of [[decadence]] before collapsing.<ref>http://www.rexresearch.com/glubb/glubb-empire.pdf</ref>\n\n[[File:Wars-Long-Run-military-civilian-fatalities.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Global deaths in conflicts since 1400.]]\n\n==Population dynamics==\nIn the general study of [[cultural change]] and [[population dynamics]], a whole system displays complex ecosystem changes. Organizational [[adaptability]] relates importantly to organizational diversity.\n\nSeveral key features of human societal collapse can be related to population dynamics.<ref>[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm Population crises and cycles in history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405081151/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm |date=2011-04-05 }}, A review of the book ''Population Crises and Population cycles'' by Claire Russell and W M S Russell.</ref> For example, the native population of Cusco, Peru at the time of the Spanish conquest was stressed by an imbalance in the [[Human sex ratio#Gender imbalance|sex ratio]] between men and women.<ref>[http://pages.wustl.edu/files/pages/imce/gchilds/covey.childs.kippen_inca_demography.pdf Dynamics of Indigenous Demographic Fluctuations: Lessons from Sixteenth-Century Cusco, Peru] R.

In his book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] proposes five interconnected causes of collapse that may reinforce each other: non-sustainable exploitation of resources, climate changes, diminishing support from friendly societies, hostile neighbors, and inappropriate attitudes for change.<ref name=Diamond>[[Jared Diamond]], ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2005 and 2011 ({{ISBN|9780241958681}}).</ref><ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/jared_diamond_on_why_societies_collapse.html Jared Diamond on why societies collapse] TED talk, Feb 2003</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Tainter]] theorizes that collapsed societies essentially exhausted their own designs, and were unable to adapt to natural diminishing returns for what they knew as their method of survival.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tainter|first1=Joseph A.|authorlink=Joseph Tainter|date=1990|title=The Collapse of Complex Societies|edition=1st paperback|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38673-9}}</ref>  It matches closely [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s idea that \"[[Wicked problem|they find problems they can't solve]]\".\n\n===Linking social and environmental dynamics===\n[[File:Temple of the Great Jaguar.jpg|thumb|During the 9th century AD, the central [[Maya civilization|Maya]] region suffered major [[Classic Maya collapse|political collapse]], marked by the abandonment of cities]]\nModern social critics commonly interpret things like sedentary social behavior as symptomatic of societal decay, and link what appears to be laziness with the depletion of important non-renewable resources. However, many primitive cultures also have high degrees of leisure, so if that is a cause in one place it may not be in another\u2014leisure or apparent laziness is then not a sufficient cause.\n\nWhat produces modern sedentary life, unlike [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, is extraordinary modern economic productivity. Tainter argues that exceptional productivity is actually more the sign of hidden weakness, both because of a society's dependence on it, and its potential to undermine its own basis for success by not being [[Self-limiting (biology)|self limiting]] as demonstrated in Western culture's ideal of perpetual growth.\n\nAs a population grows and technology makes it easier to exploit depleting resources, the environment's [[diminishing returns]] are hidden from view. Societal [[complexity]] is then potentially threatened if it develops beyond what is actually sustainable, and a disorderly reorganization were to follow. The scissors model of [[Malthusian]] collapse, where the population grows without limit and resources do not, is the idea of great opposing environmental forces cutting into each other.\n\nFor the modern world economy, for example, the growing conflict between food and fuel, depending on many of the same finite and diminishing resources, is visible in recent major [[commodity price shocks]]. It is one of the key relationships researchers, since the early studies of the [[Club of Rome]], have been most concerned with.\n\n[[Jared Diamond]] pursues these themes in his 2005 book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''.<ref name=Diamond/>\n\n===Population pressure and mineral resource exhaustion===\n[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]], has argued that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth\u2014that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels\u2014is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse, leading to the demise of human civilisation itself]].<ref name=ngr01/>\n\nGeorgescu-Roegen is basing his pessimistic prediction on the two following considerations:\n* According to his ecological view of [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']], matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in man's economy, only transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [[natural resource]]s) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]]). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary [[Heat death of the universe|'heat death']] of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment\u2014a state of maximum [[entropy]] on Earth.\n* According to his social theory of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Man's economic struggle and the social evolution of mankind (bioeconomics)|'bioeconomics']], humanity's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood is largely a continuation and extension of the biological struggle to sustain life and survive. This struggle manifests itself as a permanent social conflict that can be eliminated neither by man's decision to do so nor by the social evolution of mankind. Consequently, we are biologically unable to restrain ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the benefit of unknown future generations; the pressure of population on Earth's resources will nothing but increase.\nTaken together, the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain in the second half of the 18th century has unintentionally thrust man's economy into a long, never-to-return [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]] with regard to the [[Peak minerals|Earth's mineral stock]]. The [[world economy]] will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future. From that point on, Georgescu-Roegen conjectures, ever deepening scarcities will aggravate social conflict throughout the globe and ultimately spell the end of mankind itself.\n\nGeorgescu-Roegen was the paradigm founder of ecological economics and is also considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]]. Consequently, much work in these fields is devoted to discussing the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way\u2014or only little way\u2014of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the finite stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.<ref name=jr01/>{{rp|253\u2013256}}<ref name=kb01/>{{rp|165}}<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|168\u2013171}}<ref name=jg01/>{{rp|150\u2013153}}<ref name=js01/>{{rp|106\u2013109}}<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|546\u2013549}}<ref name=ap01/>{{rp|142\u2013145}}<ref name=hd01/>\n\n=== Theories of energy return on energy invested ===\nA related economic model is proposed by Thomas Homer-Dixon<ref>Homer-Dixon, Thomas (2007), \"The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization\" (Knopf, Canada)</ref> and by Charles Hall<ref>Hall, Charles 2009 \"What is the Minimum EROI that a Sustainable Society Must Have\" ENERGIES [http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/2/1/25]</ref> in relation to our declining productivity of energy extraction, or energy return on energy invested ([[EROEI]]). This measures the amount of surplus energy a society gets from using energy to obtain energy.\n\nThere would be no surplus if EROEI approaches 1:1. What Hall showed is that the real cutoff is well above that, estimated to be 3:1 to sustain the essential overhead energy costs of a modern society. Part of the mental equation is that the EROEI of our generally preferred energy source, [[petroleum]], has fallen in the past century from 100:1 to the range of 10:1 with clear evidence that the natural depletion curves all are downward decay curves. An EROEI of more than ~3, then, is what appears necessary to provide the energy for societally important tasks, such as maintaining government, legal and financial institutions, a transportation infrastructure, manufacturing, building construction and maintenance and the life styles of the rich and poor that a society depends on.\n\nThe EROEI figure also affects the number of people needed for [[sustainable food systems|sustainable food]] production. In the pre-modern world, it was often the case that 80% of the population was employed in agriculture to feed a population of 100%, with a low energy budget.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a compelling fact that would do well to have a reference|date=January 2019}} In modern times, the use of cheap fossil fuels with an exceedingly high EROEI enabled 100% of the population to be fed with only 4% of the population employed in agriculture.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a compelling fact that would do well to have a reference|date=January 2019}} Diminishing EROEI making fuel more expensive relative to other things may require food to be produced using less energy, and so increases the number of people employed in food production again.\n\n==== Energy scenarios of Bryn Davidson ====\n\nHere are the four \"energy scenarios\" described by Bryn Davidson (of the Dynamic Cities Project in [[Vancouver]]):<ref name=Hopkins>[[Rob Hopkins]], ''The Transition Handbook: From Oil Dependency to Local Resilience'', [[Chelsea Green Publishing]], 2008 ({{ISBN|978-1603583923}}).

They will favor intensification and commit an increasing number of resources to their present plans, projects, and social institutions.\n# The '''Runaway Train''', a society whose continuing function depends on constant growth (''cf.'' [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]'s [[Frontier Thesis]]): This type of society, based almost exclusively on acquisition (''e.g.'', pillage or exploitation), cannot be sustained indefinitely. The [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] Empires, for example, both fractured and collapsed when no new conquests could be achieved.\n#:Tainter argues that [[capitalism]] can be seen as an example of the Runaway Train model, in that [[generally accepted accounting principles|generally accepted accounting practices]] require publicly traded companies, along with many privately held ones, to exhibit growth as measured at some fixed interval (often [[Fiscal year#United States|three months]]). Moreover, the ethos of [[consumerism]] on the demand side and the practice of [[planned obsolescence]] on the supply side encourage the purchase of an ever-increasing number of goods and services even when resource extraction and food production are unsustainable if continued at current levels.\n# The '''House of Cards''', a society that has grown to be so large and include so many complex social institutions that it is inherently unstable and prone to collapse. This type of society has been seen with particular frequency among [[Eastern bloc]] and other [[Communism|communist]] nations, in which all social organizations are arms of the government or ruling party, such that the government must either stifle association wholesale (encouraging dissent and [[Subversive|subversion]]) or exercise less authority than it asserts (undermining its legitimacy in the public eye).\n#:By contrast, as [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] [[Democracy in America|observed]], when voluntary and private associations are allowed to flourish and gain legitimacy at an institutional level, they complement and often even supplant governmental functions: They provide a \"safety valve\" for dissent, assist with resource allocation, provide for social experimentation without the need for governmental coercion, and enable the public to maintain confidence in society as a whole, even during periods of governmental weakness.\n\n====Tainter's critique====\nTainter argues that these models, though superficially useful, cannot severally or jointly account for all instances of societal collapse. Often they are seen as interconnected occurrences that reinforce each other.\n\n[[File:AhuTongariki.JPG|thumb|[[Ahu Tongariki]] near [[Rano Raraku]], a 15-moai ahu excavated and restored in the 1990s]]\n\nFor example, the failure of [[Easter Island]]'s leaders to remedy rapid ecological deterioration cannot be understood without reference to the other models above. The islanders, who erected large statues called ''[[moai]]'' as a form of religious reverence to their ancestors, used felled trees as rollers to transport them. Because the islanders firmly believed that their displays of reverence would lead to increased future prosperity, they had a deeply entrenched incentive to intensify ''moai'' production. Because Easter Island's geographic isolation made its resources hard to replenish and made the balance of its overall ecosystem very delicate (\"House of Cards\"), deforestation led to soil erosion and insufficient resources to build boats for fishing or tools for hunting. Competition for dwindling resources resulted in warfare and many casualties (an additional \"Runaway Train\" iteration). Together these events led to the collapse of the civilization, but no single factor above provides an adequate account.\n\nMainstream interpretations of the history of Easter Island also include the slave raiders who abducted a large proportion of the population and epidemics that killed most of the survivors {{crossref|(see {{slink|Easter Island History|Destruction of society and population}})}}. Again, no single point explains the collapse; only a complex and integrated view can do so.\n\nTainter's position is that social complexity is a recent and comparatively anomalous occurrence requiring constant support. He asserts that collapse is best understood by grasping four axioms. In his own words (p.&nbsp;194):\n\n# human societies are problem-solving organizations;\n# sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance;\n# increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita; and\n# investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response reaches a point of declining marginal returns.\n\nWith these facts in mind, collapse can simply be understood as a loss of the energy needed to maintain social complexity. Collapse is thus the sudden loss of social complexity, stratification, internal and external communication and exchange, and productivity.\n\n===Toynbee\u2019s theory of decay===\nThe [[United Kingdom|British]] [[historian]] [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], in his 12-volume [[masterpiece]] ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1961), theorized that all [[civilization]]s pass through several distinct stages: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. ([[Carroll Quigley]] would expand on and refine this theory in his \"The Evolution of Civilizations\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/CarrollQuigley-TheEvolutionOfCivilizations-AnIntroductionTo The Evolution of Civilizations]</ref>)\n\nToynbee argues that the breakdown of civilizations is not caused by loss of control over the environment, over the human environment, or attacks from outside. Rather, societies that develop great expertise in problem solving become incapable of solving new problems by overdeveloping their structures for solving old ones.\n\nThe fixation on the old methods of the \"Creative Minority\" leads it to eventually cease to be creative and degenerates into merely a \"[[dominant minority]]\" (that forces the majority to obey without meriting obedience), failing to recognize new ways of thinking. He argues that creative minorities deteriorate due to a worship of their \"former self\", by which they become prideful, and fail to adequately address the next challenge they face.\n\nHe argues that the ultimate sign a civilization has broken down is when the dominant minority forms a [[A Study of History#Universal state|Universal State]], which stifles political creativity. He states:\n\n{{quote|First the Dominant Minority attempts to hold by force - against all right and reason - a position of inherited privilege which it has ceased to merit; and then the [[Proletariat]] repays injustice with resentment, fear with hate, and violence with violence when it executes its acts of secession. Yet the whole movement ends in positive acts of creation - and this on the part of all the actors in the tragedy of disintegration. The Dominant Minority creates a universal state, the Internal Proletariat a universal church, and the External Proletariat a bevy of barbarian war-bands.}}\n\nHe argues that, as civilizations decay, they form an \"Internal Proletariat\" and an \"External Proletariat.\" The Internal proletariat is held in subjugation by the dominant minority inside the civilization, and grows bitter; the external proletariat exists outside the civilization in poverty and chaos, and grows envious. He argues that as civilizations decay, there is a \"schism in the body social\", whereby ''abandon'' and ''self-control'' together replace [[creativity]], and ''truancy'' and ''martyrdom'' together replace [[Apprenticeship|disciple]]ship by the creative minority.\n\nHe argues that in this environment, people resort to [[archaism]] (idealization of the past), [[Futures studies|futurism]] (idealization of the future), [[escapism|detachment]] (removal of oneself from the realities of a decaying world), and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] (meeting the challenges of the decaying civilization with new insight, as a Prophet). He argues that those who transcend during a period of social decay give birth to a new Church with new and stronger spiritual insights, around which a subsequent civilization may begin to form after the old has died.\n\nToynbee's use of the word 'church' refers to the collective spiritual bond of a common worship, or the same unity found in some kind of [[social order]].\n\n===Systems science===\nResearchers, as yet, have very little ability to identify internal structures of large distributed systems like human societies, which is an important scientific problem. Genuine structural collapse seems, in many cases, the only plausible explanation supporting the idea that such structures exist. However, until they can be concretely identified, scientific inquiry appears limited to the construction of scientific narratives,<ref>T.F. Allen, J.A. Tainter et al. 2001 Dragnet Ecology: The Privilege of Science in a Postmodern World. BioScience</ref> using [[systems thinking]] for careful [[storytelling]] about systemic organization and change.\n\nHistory includes many examples of the appearance and disappearance of human societies with no obvious explanation. The abrupt [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the course of a few months, without any external attack, according to [[Johan Galtung]] was due to growing structural contradictions brought on by geopolitical overreach, which could not be resolved within the existing socio-political systems.\n\nAlthough a societal collapse is generally an endpoint for the administration of a culture's social and economic life, societal collapse can also be seen as simply a change of administration within the same culture. [[Russian culture]] would seem to have outlived both the society of [[Imperial Russia]] and the society of the [[Soviet Union]], for example. Frequently the societal collapse phenomenon is also a process of decentralization of authority after a 'classic' period of centralized social order, perhaps replaced by competing centers as the central authority weakens. Societal failure may also result in a degree of empowerment for the lower levels of a former climax society, who escape from the burden of onerous taxes and control by exploitative elites. For example, the [[Black Death|black plague]] contributed to breaking the hold of [[Europe]]an [[feudal society]] on its [[underclass]] in the 15th century.\n\n==Examples of civilizations and

In some cases a natural disaster (e.g. [[tsunami]], [[earthquake]], massive fire or climate change) may precipitate a collapse. Other factors such as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] or [[resource depletion]] might be the proximate cause of collapse. Significant inequity and exposed corruption may combine with lack of loyalty to established political institutions and result in an oppressed lower class rising up and seizing power from a smaller wealthy elite in a [[revolution]]. The diversity of forms that societies evolve corresponds to diversity in their failures. [[Jared Diamond]] suggests that societies have also collapsed through [[deforestation]], loss of soil fertility, [[protectionism|restrictions of trade]] and/or rising endemic violence.<ref>Diamond, Jared \"Collapse: Why some societies succeed and others fail\"</ref>\n\n===Black Swan event===\n\nIn many instances of rapid collapse, a major event will tend to precede its collapse. \n\nThis major event is called a [[black swan event]], because although initially overlooked, it becomes evident in hindsight once the collapse occurs.\n\nSuch a black swan event could be an unnecessary war that overburdens the society's treasury (as in the case of the [[Weimar Republic]] or [[French Revolution|Pre-revolution]] [[French Monarchy]]) or unsustainable [[resource depletion]].\n\n===Foreign invasions===\n[[File:Bronze-age-collapse.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A map of the [[Bronze Age collapse]]]]\n{{See also|Bond event}}\n\nThe decline of the [[Roman Empire]] is one of the events traditionally marking the end of [[Classical Antiquity]] and the beginning of the European [[Middle Ages]]. Throughout the 5th century, the Empire's territories in western Europe and northwestern Africa, including Italy, fell to various invading or indigenous peoples in what is sometimes called the [[Barbarian invasions]], although the eastern half still survived with borders essentially intact for another two centuries (until the [[Muslim conquests|Arab expansion]]). This view of the collapse of the Roman Empire is challenged, however, by modern historians who see Rome as merely transforming from the Western Empire into barbarian kingdoms as the Western Emperors delegated themselves out of existence, and the East transforming into the [[Byzantine Empire]], which only fell in 1453 AD.\n\n[[North Africa]]'s populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the [[Bedouin]] tribes of [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]].<ref>[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=461 The Great Mosque of Tlemcen], MuslimHeritage.com</ref> [[Ibn Khaldun]] noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.<ref>[http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm Populations Crises and Population Cycles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527170154/http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm |date=2013-05-27 }}, Claire Russell and W.M.S.

It is neither pleasing to Heaven nor creditable that our race should cease and the name of Romans meet extinguishment in us, and the city be given up to foreigners,\u2014Greek or even barbarians. We liberate slaves chiefly for the purpose of making out of them as many citizens as possible; we give our allies a share in the government that our numbers may increase: yet you, Romans of the original stock, including Quintii, Valerii, Iulli, are eager that your families and names at once shall perish with you.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dio |first=Cassius |authorlink=Cassius Dio |year=2004 |title=Dio's Rome|volume= 4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdGQNIxBMh0C |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |page=86 |isbn=978-1-4191-1611-7 |accessdate=3 November 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nUpon the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]], Augustus introduced [[Jus trium liberorum|legislation]] designed to increase the birth rate.<ref name=\"EBAugustus\">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Rome/The-Roman-Senate-and-the-urban-magistracies#ref26655|title=Administration of Rome and Italy|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Changes occurring with collapse==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nThere are three main types of collapse:\n\n'''Reversion/Simplification''': A society's [[adaptive capacity]] may be reduced by either a rapid change in population or societal complexity, destabilizing its institutions and causing massive shifts in population and other social dynamics. In cases of collapse, civilizations tend to revert to less complex, less centralized socio-political forms using simpler technology. These are characteristics of a [[Dark Ages in history|Dark Age]]. Examples of such societal collapse are: the [[Hittite Empire]], the [[Mycenaean civilization]], the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Mauryan]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] Empires in India, the [[Mayas]], the [[Angkor]] in Cambodia, the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties in China and the [[Mali Empire]].\n\n'''Incorporation/Absorption''': Alternately, a society may be gradually incorporated into a more dynamic, more complex inter-regional social structure. This happened in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and [[Levant|Levantine cultures]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Delhi Sultanate]]s in India, [[Song Dynasty|Song China]], the [[Aztec]] culture in Mesoamerica, the [[Inca]] culture in South America, and the modern civilizations of China, Japan, and India, as well as many modern states in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n'''Obliteration''': Vast numbers of people in the society die, or the birth rate plunges to a level that causes a dramatic depopulation.\n\nOther changes that may accompany a collapse:\n\n* '''Destratification''': Complex societies stratified on the basis of class, gender, race or some other salient factor become much more homogeneous or horizontally structured. In many cases past social stratification slowly becomes irrelevant following collapse and societies become more egalitarian.\n* '''Despecialization''': One of the most characteristic features of complex civilizations (and in many cases the yardstick to measure complexity) is a high level of [[division of labor|job specialization]]. The most complex societies are characterized by artisans and tradespeople who specialize intensely in a given task. Indeed, the rulers of many past societies were hyper-specialized priests or priestesses who were completely supported by the work of the lower classes. During societal collapse, the social institutions supporting such specialization are removed and people tend to become more generalized in their work and daily habits.\n* '''Decentralization''': As power becomes decentralized, people tend to be more self-regimented and have many more personal freedoms. In many instances of collapse, there is a slackening of social rules and etiquette. Geographically speaking, communities become more parochial or isolated. For example, following the [[Classic Maya collapse|collapse of the Maya civilization]], many Maya returned to their traditional hamlets, moving away from the large cities that had dominated the political landscape.\n* '''Destructuralization''': Institutions, processes, and artifacts are all manifest in the archaeological record in abundance in large civilizations. After collapse, evidence of epiphenomena, institutions, and types of artifacts change dramatically as people are forced to adopt more self-sufficient lifestyles.\n* '''Depopulation''': Societal collapse is almost always associated with a [[population decline]]. In extreme cases, the collapse in population is so severe that the society disappears entirely, such as happened with the [[History of Greenland|Greenland Vikings]], or a number of [[Polynesia]]n islands. In less extreme cases, populations are reduced until a [[demography|demographic balance]] is re-established between human societies and the depleted [[natural environment]]. A classic example is the city of [[History of Rome|Rome]], which had a population of about 1.5 million at the peak of the [[Roman Empire]] during the reign of [[Trajan]] in the early 2nd century AD, but in the [[Early Middle Ages]] the population had declined to only around 15,000 inhabitants by the 9th century.\n* '''Decadence''': [[John Bagot Glubb|Sir John Glubb Pasha]] (1897-1987), a British military officer and historian in his essay, 'Fate of Empires' said most empires will tend to experience an age of [[decadence]] before collapsing.<ref>http://www.rexresearch.com/glubb/glubb-empire.pdf</ref>\n\n[[File:Wars-Long-Run-military-civilian-fatalities.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Global deaths in conflicts since 1400.]]\n\n==Population dynamics==\nIn the general study of [[cultural change]] and [[population dynamics]], a whole system displays complex ecosystem changes. Organizational [[adaptability]] relates importantly to organizational diversity.\n\nSeveral key features of human societal collapse can be related to population dynamics.<ref>[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm Population crises and cycles in history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405081151/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm |date=2011-04-05 }}, A review of the book ''Population Crises and Population cycles'' by Claire Russell and W M S Russell.</ref> For example, the native population of Cusco, Peru at the time of the Spanish conquest was stressed by an imbalance in the [[Human sex ratio#Gender imbalance|sex ratio]] between men and women.<ref>[http://pages.wustl.edu/files/pages/imce/gchilds/covey.childs.kippen_inca_demography.pdf Dynamics of Indigenous Demographic Fluctuations: Lessons from Sixteenth-Century Cusco, Peru] R.

In his book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] proposes five interconnected causes of collapse that may reinforce each other: non-sustainable exploitation of resources, climate changes, diminishing support from friendly societies, hostile neighbors, and inappropriate attitudes for change.<ref name=Diamond>[[Jared Diamond]], ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2005 and 2011 ({{ISBN|9780241958681}}).</ref><ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/jared_diamond_on_why_societies_collapse.html Jared Diamond on why societies collapse] TED talk, Feb 2003</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Tainter]] theorizes that collapsed societies essentially exhausted their own designs, and were unable to adapt to natural diminishing returns for what they knew as their method of survival.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tainter|first1=Joseph A.|authorlink=Joseph Tainter|date=1990|title=The Collapse of Complex Societies|edition=1st paperback|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38673-9}}</ref>  It matches closely [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s idea that \"[[Wicked problem|they find problems they can't solve]]\".\n\n===Linking social and environmental dynamics===\n[[File:Temple of the Great Jaguar.jpg|thumb|During the 9th century AD, the central [[Maya civilization|Maya]] region suffered major [[Classic Maya collapse|political collapse]], marked by the abandonment of cities]]\nModern social critics commonly interpret things like sedentary social behavior as symptomatic of societal decay, and link what appears to be laziness with the depletion of important non-renewable resources. However, many primitive cultures also have high degrees of leisure, so if that is a cause in one place it may not be in another\u2014leisure or apparent laziness is then not a sufficient cause.\n\nWhat produces modern sedentary life, unlike [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, is extraordinary modern economic productivity. Tainter argues that exceptional productivity is actually more the sign of hidden weakness, both because of a society's dependence on it, and its potential to undermine its own basis for success by not being [[Self-limiting (biology)|self limiting]] as demonstrated in Western culture's ideal of perpetual growth.\n\nAs a population grows and technology makes it easier to exploit depleting resources, the environment's [[diminishing returns]] are hidden from view. Societal [[complexity]] is then potentially threatened if it develops beyond what is actually sustainable, and a disorderly reorganization were to follow. The scissors model of [[Malthusian]] collapse, where the population grows without limit and resources do not, is the idea of great opposing environmental forces cutting into each other.\n\nFor the modern world economy, for example, the growing conflict between food and fuel, depending on many of the same finite and diminishing resources, is visible in recent major [[commodity price shocks]]. It is one of the key relationships researchers, since the early studies of the [[Club of Rome]], have been most concerned with.\n\n[[Jared Diamond]] pursues these themes in his 2005 book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''.<ref name=Diamond/>\n\n===Population pressure and mineral resource exhaustion===\n[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]], has argued that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth\u2014that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels\u2014is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse, leading to the demise of human civilisation itself]].<ref name=ngr01/>\n\nGeorgescu-Roegen is basing his pessimistic prediction on the two following considerations:\n* According to his ecological view of [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']], matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in man's economy, only transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [[natural resource]]s) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]]). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary [[Heat death of the universe|'heat death']] of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment\u2014a state of maximum [[entropy]] on Earth.\n* According to his social theory of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Man's economic struggle and the social evolution of mankind (bioeconomics)|'bioeconomics']], humanity's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood is largely a continuation and extension of the biological struggle to sustain life and survive. This struggle manifests itself as a permanent social conflict that can be eliminated neither by man's decision to do so nor by the social evolution of mankind. Consequently, we are biologically unable to restrain ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the benefit of unknown future generations; the pressure of population on Earth's resources will nothing but increase.\nTaken together, the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain in the second half of the 18th century has unintentionally thrust man's economy into a long, never-to-return [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]] with regard to the [[Peak minerals|Earth's mineral stock]]. The [[world economy]] will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future. From that point on, Georgescu-Roegen conjectures, ever deepening scarcities will aggravate social conflict throughout the globe and ultimately spell the end of mankind itself.\n\nGeorgescu-Roegen was the paradigm founder of ecological economics and is also considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]]. Consequently, much work in these fields is devoted to discussing the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way\u2014or only little way\u2014of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the finite stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.<ref name=jr01/>{{rp|253\u2013256}}<ref name=kb01/>{{rp|165}}<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|168\u2013171}}<ref name=jg01/>{{rp|150\u2013153}}<ref name=js01/>{{rp|106\u2013109}}<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|546\u2013549}}<ref name=ap01/>{{rp|142\u2013145}}<ref name=hd01/>\n\n=== Theories of energy return on energy invested ===\nA related economic model is proposed by Thomas Homer-Dixon<ref>Homer-Dixon, Thomas (2007), \"The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization\" (Knopf, Canada)</ref> and by Charles Hall<ref>Hall, Charles 2009 \"What is the Minimum EROI that a Sustainable Society Must Have\" ENERGIES [http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/2/1/25]</ref> in relation to our declining productivity of energy extraction, or energy return on energy invested ([[EROEI]]). This measures the amount of surplus energy a society gets from using energy to obtain energy.\n\nThere would be no surplus if EROEI approaches 1:1. What Hall showed is that the real cutoff is well above that, estimated to be 3:1 to sustain the essential overhead energy costs of a modern society. Part of the mental equation is that the EROEI of our generally preferred energy source, [[petroleum]], has fallen in the past century from 100:1 to the range of 10:1 with clear evidence that the natural depletion curves all are downward decay curves. An EROEI of more than ~3, then, is what appears necessary to provide the energy for societally important tasks, such as maintaining government, legal and financial institutions, a transportation infrastructure, manufacturing, building construction and maintenance and the life styles of the rich and poor that a society depends on.\n\nThe EROEI figure also affects the number of people needed for [[sustainable food systems|sustainable food]] production. In the pre-modern world, it was often the case that 80% of the population was employed in agriculture to feed a population of 100%, with a low energy budget.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a compelling fact that would do well to have a reference|date=January 2019}} In modern times, the use of cheap fossil fuels with an exceedingly high EROEI enabled 100% of the population to be fed with only 4% of the population employed in agriculture.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a compelling fact that would do well to have a reference|date=January 2019}} Diminishing EROEI making fuel more expensive relative to other things may require food to be produced using less energy, and so increases the number of people employed in food production again.\n\n==== Energy scenarios of Bryn Davidson ====\n\nHere are the four \"energy scenarios\" described by Bryn Davidson (of the Dynamic Cities Project in [[Vancouver]]):<ref name=Hopkins>[[Rob Hopkins]], ''The Transition Handbook: From Oil Dependency to Local Resilience'', [[Chelsea Green Publishing]], 2008 ({{ISBN|978-1603583923}}).

They will favor intensification and commit an increasing number of resources to their present plans, projects, and social institutions.\n# The '''Runaway Train''', a society whose continuing function depends on constant growth (''cf.'' [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]'s [[Frontier Thesis]]): This type of society, based almost exclusively on acquisition (''e.g.'', pillage or exploitation), cannot be sustained indefinitely. The [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] Empires, for example, both fractured and collapsed when no new conquests could be achieved.\n#:Tainter argues that [[capitalism]] can be seen as an example of the Runaway Train model, in that [[generally accepted accounting principles|generally accepted accounting practices]] require publicly traded companies, along with many privately held ones, to exhibit growth as measured at some fixed interval (often [[Fiscal year#United States|three months]]). Moreover, the ethos of [[consumerism]] on the demand side and the practice of [[planned obsolescence]] on the supply side encourage the purchase of an ever-increasing number of goods and services even when resource extraction and food production are unsustainable if continued at current levels.\n# The '''House of Cards''', a society that has grown to be so large and include so many complex social institutions that it is inherently unstable and prone to collapse. This type of society has been seen with particular frequency among [[Eastern bloc]] and other [[Communism|communist]] nations, in which all social organizations are arms of the government or ruling party, such that the government must either stifle association wholesale (encouraging dissent and [[Subversive|subversion]]) or exercise less authority than it asserts (undermining its legitimacy in the public eye).\n#:By contrast, as [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] [[Democracy in America|observed]], when voluntary and private associations are allowed to flourish and gain legitimacy at an institutional level, they complement and often even supplant governmental functions: They provide a \"safety valve\" for dissent, assist with resource allocation, provide for social experimentation without the need for governmental coercion, and enable the public to maintain confidence in society as a whole, even during periods of governmental weakness.\n\n====Tainter's critique====\nTainter argues that these models, though superficially useful, cannot severally or jointly account for all instances of societal collapse. Often they are seen as interconnected occurrences that reinforce each other.\n\n[[File:AhuTongariki.JPG|thumb|[[Ahu Tongariki]] near [[Rano Raraku]], a 15-moai ahu excavated and restored in the 1990s]]\n\nFor example, the failure of [[Easter Island]]'s leaders to remedy rapid ecological deterioration cannot be understood without reference to the other models above. The islanders, who erected large statues called ''[[moai]]'' as a form of religious reverence to their ancestors, used felled trees as rollers to transport them. Because the islanders firmly believed that their displays of reverence would lead to increased future prosperity, they had a deeply entrenched incentive to intensify ''moai'' production. Because Easter Island's geographic isolation made its resources hard to replenish and made the balance of its overall ecosystem very delicate (\"House of Cards\"), deforestation led to soil erosion and insufficient resources to build boats for fishing or tools for hunting. Competition for dwindling resources resulted in warfare and many casualties (an additional \"Runaway Train\" iteration). Together these events led to the collapse of the civilization, but no single factor above provides an adequate account.\n\nMainstream interpretations of the history of Easter Island also include the slave raiders who abducted a large proportion of the population and epidemics that killed most of the survivors {{crossref|(see {{slink|Easter Island History|Destruction of society and population}})}}. Again, no single point explains the collapse; only a complex and integrated view can do so.\n\nTainter's position is that social complexity is a recent and comparatively anomalous occurrence requiring constant support. He asserts that collapse is best understood by grasping four axioms. In his own words (p.&nbsp;194):\n\n# human societies are problem-solving organizations;\n# sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance;\n# increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita; and\n# investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response reaches a point of declining marginal returns.\n\nWith these facts in mind, collapse can simply be understood as a loss of the energy needed to maintain social complexity. Collapse is thus the sudden loss of social complexity, stratification, internal and external communication and exchange, and productivity.\n\n===Toynbee\u2019s theory of decay===\nThe [[United Kingdom|British]] [[historian]] [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], in his 12-volume [[masterpiece]] ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1961), theorized that all [[civilization]]s pass through several distinct stages: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. ([[Carroll Quigley]] would expand on and refine this theory in his \"The Evolution of Civilizations\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/CarrollQuigley-TheEvolutionOfCivilizations-AnIntroductionTo The Evolution of Civilizations]</ref>)\n\nToynbee argues that the breakdown of civilizations is not caused by loss of control over the environment, over the human environment, or attacks from outside. Rather, societies that develop great expertise in problem solving become incapable of solving new problems by overdeveloping their structures for solving old ones.\n\nThe fixation on the old methods of the \"Creative Minority\" leads it to eventually cease to be creative and degenerates into merely a \"[[dominant minority]]\" (that forces the majority to obey without meriting obedience), failing to recognize new ways of thinking. He argues that creative minorities deteriorate due to a worship of their \"former self\", by which they become prideful, and fail to adequately address the next challenge they face.\n\nHe argues that the ultimate sign a civilization has broken down is when the dominant minority forms a [[A Study of History#Universal state|Universal State]], which stifles political creativity. He states:\n\n{{quote|First the Dominant Minority attempts to hold by force - against all right and reason - a position of inherited privilege which it has ceased to merit; and then the [[Proletariat]] repays injustice with resentment, fear with hate, and violence with violence when it executes its acts of secession. Yet the whole movement ends in positive acts of creation - and this on the part of all the actors in the tragedy of disintegration. The Dominant Minority creates a universal state, the Internal Proletariat a universal church, and the External Proletariat a bevy of barbarian war-bands.}}\n\nHe argues that, as civilizations decay, they form an \"Internal Proletariat\" and an \"External Proletariat.\" The Internal proletariat is held in subjugation by the dominant minority inside the civilization, and grows bitter; the external proletariat exists outside the civilization in poverty and chaos, and grows envious. He argues that as civilizations decay, there is a \"schism in the body social\", whereby ''abandon'' and ''self-control'' together replace [[creativity]], and ''truancy'' and ''martyrdom'' together replace [[Apprenticeship|disciple]]ship by the creative minority.\n\nHe argues that in this environment, people resort to [[archaism]] (idealization of the past), [[Futures studies|futurism]] (idealization of the future), [[escapism|detachment]] (removal of oneself from the realities of a decaying world), and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] (meeting the challenges of the decaying civilization with new insight, as a Prophet). He argues that those who transcend during a period of social decay give birth to a new Church with new and stronger spiritual insights, around which a subsequent civilization may begin to form after the old has died.\n\nToynbee's use of the word 'church' refers to the collective spiritual bond of a common worship, or the same unity found in some kind of [[social order]].\n\n===Systems science===\nResearchers, as yet, have very little ability to identify internal structures of large distributed systems like human societies, which is an important scientific problem. Genuine structural collapse seems, in many cases, the only plausible explanation supporting the idea that such structures exist. However, until they can be concretely identified, scientific inquiry appears limited to the construction of scientific narratives,<ref>T.F. Allen, J.A. Tainter et al. 2001 Dragnet Ecology: The Privilege of Science in a Postmodern World. BioScience</ref> using [[systems thinking]] for careful [[storytelling]] about systemic organization and change.\n\nHistory includes many examples of the appearance and disappearance of human societies with no obvious explanation. The abrupt [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the course of a few months, without any external attack, according to [[Johan Galtung]] was due to growing structural contradictions brought on by geopolitical overreach, which could not be resolved within the existing socio-political systems.\n\nAlthough a societal collapse is generally an endpoint for the administration of a culture's social and economic life, societal collapse can also be seen as simply a change of administration within the same culture. [[Russian culture]] would seem to have outlived both the society of [[Imperial Russia]] and the society of the [[Soviet Union]], for example. Frequently the societal collapse phenomenon is also a process of decentralization of authority after a 'classic' period of centralized social order, perhaps replaced by competing centers as the central authority weakens. Societal failure may also result in a degree of empowerment for the lower levels of a former climax society, who escape from the burden of onerous taxes and control by exploitative elites. For example, the [[Black Death|black plague]] contributed to breaking the hold of [[Europe]]an [[feudal society]] on its [[underclass]] in the 15th century.\n\n==Examples of civilizations and

Retrieved on February 26, 2008.</ref>\n\nRoosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (''hackles'') and backs (''saddle''), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the [[Sebright chicken]], the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]], or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]]. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called [[Caruncle (bird anatomy)|caruncles]].  Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.\nA ''muff'' or ''beard'' is a [[mutation]] found in several chicken breeds which causes extra [[feather]]ing under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a [[beard]].\nDomestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.\n\n=== Behavior ===\n==== Social behaviour ====\n[[File:Hen with chicks, Raisen district, MP, India.jpg|thumb|x200px|Hen with chicks, India.]]\n[[File:Cascais Costa do Esteril 52 (36583204550).jpg|thumb|200px|Hen with chicks, [[Portugal]].]]\nChickens are [[gregarious]] birds and live together in [[herd|flocks]]. They have a communal approach to the [[avian incubation|incubation]] of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a \"[[pecking order]]\", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.<ref>{{cite web |author=Stonehead |url=http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |title=Introducing new hens to a flock \" Musings from a Stonehead |website=Stonehead.wordpress.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813113406/http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nWhen a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first.

The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.  Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other.  There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sherwin |first1=C.M. |last2=Nicol |first2=C.J. |year=1993 |title=Factors influencing floor-laying by hens in modified cages |url= |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=36 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=211\u2013222 |doi=10.1016/0168-1591(93)90011-d}}</ref>\n[[File:\u0c15\u0c4b\u0c21\u0c3f \u0c2a\u0c3f\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32IMG20191207080730-01.jpg|thumb |right]]\n\n==== Broodiness ====\nUnder natural conditions, most birds lay only until a [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to \"go [[Broodiness|broody]]\".  The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12&nbsp;eggs). She will \"sit\" or \"set\" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe. While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest. To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.\n[[File:1911 EB Chicken skull.png|thumb|left|200px|Skull of a three-week-old chicken.

However, other breeds, such as the [[Cochin (chicken)|Cochin]], [[Cornish (chicken)|Cornish]] and [[Silkie (chicken)|Silkie]], do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species \u2014 even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as [[quail]], [[pheasant]]s, [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]], or [[Goose|geese]].\n\n{{clear}}\n==== Hatching and early life ====\nFertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.<ref name=\"grandin69\"/> Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so.  Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by \"pipping\"; pecking a breathing hole with its [[egg tooth]] towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side.  The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell).  The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid.  The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet [[Down feather|down]] dries out in the warmth of the nest.\n\nHens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal [[yolk sac]]. Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ali |first1=A. |last2=Cheng |first2=K.M. |year=1985 |title=Early egg production in genetically blind (rc/rc) chickens in comparison with sighted (Rc+/rc) controls |journal=Poultry Science |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=789\u2013794 |doi=10.3382/ps.0640789 |pmid=4001066}}</ref> Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night.

Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gongora |first1=Jaime |last2=Rawlence |first2=Nicolas J. |last3=Mobegi |first3=Victor A. |last4=Jianlin |first4=Han |last5=Alcalde |first5=Jose A. |last6=Matus |first6=Jose T. |last7=Hanotte |first7=Olivier |last8=Moran |first8=Chris |last9=Austin |first9=J. | last10 = Ulm | first10 = Sean |last11=Anderson |first11=Atholl J. |last12=Larson |first12=Greger |last13=Cooper |first13=Alan |year=2008 |title=Indo-European and Asian origins for Chilean and Pacific chickens revealed by mtDNA |url= |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=30 |pages=10308\u201310313 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0801991105 |pmid=18663216 |pmc=2492461 |bibcode=2008PNAS..10510308G}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe debate for and against a Polynesian origin for South American chickens continued with this 2014 paper and subsequent responses in ''PNAS''.<ref name=\"ThomsonLebrasseur2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=Vicki A.|last2=Lebrasseur|first2=Oph\u00e9lie|last3=Austin|first3=Jeremy J.|last4=Hunt|first4=Terry L.|last5=Burney|first5=David A.|last6=Denham|first6=Tim|last7=Rawlence|first7=Nicolas J.|last8=Wood|first8=Jamie R.|last9=Gongora|first9=Jaime|last10=Girdland Flink|first10=Linus|last11=Linderholm|first11=Anna|last12=Dobney|first12=Keith|last13=Larson|first13=Greger|last14=Cooper|first14=Alan|title=Using ancient DNA to study the origins and dispersal of ancestral Polynesian chickens across the Pacific|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=13|year=2014|pages=4826\u20134831|issn=0027-8424|doi=10.1073/pnas.1320412111|pmid=24639505|pmc=3977275|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.4826T}}</ref>\n\n== Use by humans ==\n\n=== Farming ===\n{{Main|Poultry farming|Chicken as food}}\n[[File:BatteryChicken5DaysOutOfCage.jpg|thumb|upright|A former [[Battery cage|battery]] hen, five days after release.

Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1&nbsp;\u00b0C (1.8&nbsp;\u00b0F) from the optimum temperature of {{convert|37.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. [[Relative humidity]] should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren't turned, the [[embryo]] inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the [[embryo]] with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation.\n\nMany commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process. Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp.\n\n== Diseases and ailments ==\nChickens are susceptible to several [[parasite]]s, including [[lice]], [[mite]]s, [[tick]]s, [[flea]]s, and [[Roundworm|intestinal worms]], as well as other diseases.

A chicken is considered a channel for [[evil spirit]]s which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life.\n\nIn [[ancient Greece]], chickens were not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because they were still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of [[Ares]], [[Heracles]], and [[Athena]]. The alleged last words of [[Socrates]] as he died from [[conium|hemlock]] poisoning, as recounted by [[Plato]], were \"[[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], I owe a cock to [[Asclepius]]; will you remember to pay the debt?\", signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life.\n\nThe Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters. Several of [[Aesop's Fables]] reference this belief.\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], Jesus prophesied the betrayal by [[Saint Peter|Peter]]: \"Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.'\"<ref>[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:34</ref> It happened,<ref>[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:61</ref> and Peter cried bitterly. This made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal.\n\nEarlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about [[Jerusalem]]: \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.\"<ref>[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:37; also Luke 13:34.

A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person's sins in kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God's hands.\n\nThe [[Talmud]] speaks of learning \"courtesy toward one's mate\" from the rooster.<ref>Eruvin 100b.</ref> This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first.  A rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked. The [[Talmud]] likewise provides us with the statement \"Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks\",<ref>A Treasury of [[Jew]]ish Quotations By Joseph L. Baron \u2013 1985</ref><ref>Jonathan ben Nappaha. [[Talmud]]: Erubin 100b</ref> which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of \"a girt one of the loins\" ([[Young's Literal Translation]]) that which is \"stately in his stride\" and \"move with stately bearing\" in the [[Book of Proverbs]] 30:29-31 as referenced by [[Michael V. Fox]] in his ''Proverbs'' 10-31 where Sa\u02bbadiah ben Yosef Gaon ([[Saadia Gaon]]) identifies the definitive trait of \"A cock girded about the loins\" in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:31 ([[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible]]) as \"the honesty of their behavior and their success\",<ref>PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18, Michael V. Fox, Yale University Press 2009, 704 pages</ref> identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use.\n\nThe chicken is one of the symbols of the [[Chinese Zodiac]]. In [[Chinese folk religion]], a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian deities such as the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] are not recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with \"serious\" prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In [[Confucian]] Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g., sudden death) to attend the ceremony. A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken's head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed. However, this practice is rare today.\n\nA [[cockatrice]] was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster, as well as killed by a rooster's call.\n\n== In history ==\n[[File:Red junglefowl hm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[red junglefowl]]]]\nAn early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (''*manuk'') is part of the reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian language]] {{crossref|(see [[Austronesian languages]])}}.

It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet [[Apicius]] offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the recipes include the [[stomach]], liver, [[testicle]]s and even the [[pygostyle]] (the fatty \"tail\" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach).\n\nThe Roman author [[Columella]] gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise, ''De Re Rustica'' (On Agriculture). He identified Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for [[cockfighting]] by the Greeks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.4). For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.13). Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages.\n\nAccording to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.7), the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by [[eagles]] or [[goshawks]]. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male hatchlings, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings (''De Re Rustica'' 8.5.11).\n\nColumella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals and \"poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke\" (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.1).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uCVOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=Per+Columella,+chicken+coops#v=onepage&q=Per+Columella,+chicken+coops&f=false|title=The New England Farmer|date=March 13, 2019|page=69|publisher=Thomas W.

Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths.\n\nAccording to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.4.1), chickens should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (''Lolium'' sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (''Medicago sativa'' L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the [[winter solstice]], in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.\n\nColumella<ref>{{Cite book |title=On agriculture, volume II: books 5\u20139 |last=ES Forster, EH Heffner |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1954 |isbn=978-0674994485 |location=The Loeb Classical Library |pages=355}}</ref> advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years, those that aren't productive or are poor care-takers of their eggs, and particularly those that eat their own and other hens' eggs.\n\nAccording to Aldrovandi, capons were produced by burning \"the hind part of the bowels, or loins or spurs\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3fMkPVL1KF4C&pg=PA278&lpg=PA278&dq=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron#v=onepage&q=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron&f=false|title=The Wisdom of Birds: An Illustrated History of Ornithology|first=Tim|last=Birkhead|page=278|date=March 13, 2019|publisher=Bloomsbury|accessdate=March 13, 2019|via=Google Books|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913140939/https://books.google.com/books?id=3fMkPVL1KF4C&pg=PA278&lpg=PA278&dq=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron&source=bl&ots=ulBRruboVR&sig=UgJy-zQT0EAjOEaguDrqH9jYzCQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1n1LUN6FK-G8yAGMi4DYAQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron&f=false|archive-date=September 13, 2016|url-status=live|isbn=9780747598220}}</ref> with a hot iron.

However, in some breeds, such as the [[Sebright chicken]], the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]], or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]]. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called [[Caruncle (bird anatomy)|caruncles]].  Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.\nA ''muff'' or ''beard'' is a [[mutation]] found in several chicken breeds which causes extra [[feather]]ing under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a [[beard]].\nDomestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.\n\n=== Behavior ===\n==== Social behaviour ====\n[[File:Hen with chicks, Raisen district, MP, India.jpg|thumb|x200px|Hen with chicks, India.]]\n[[File:Cascais Costa do Esteril 52 (36583204550).jpg|thumb|200px|Hen with chicks, [[Portugal]].]]\nChickens are [[gregarious]] birds and live together in [[herd|flocks]]. They have a communal approach to the [[avian incubation|incubation]] of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a \"[[pecking order]]\", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.<ref>{{cite web |author=Stonehead |url=http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |title=Introducing new hens to a flock \" Musings from a Stonehead |website=Stonehead.wordpress.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813113406/http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nWhen a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.\n\nA rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-07-cock-roosters-crow.html |title=Top cock: Roosters crow in pecking order |access-date=2018-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115124738/https://phys.org/news/2015-07-cock-roosters-crow.html |archive-date=January 15, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.

The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.  Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other.  There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sherwin |first1=C.M. |last2=Nicol |first2=C.J. |year=1993 |title=Factors influencing floor-laying by hens in modified cages |url= |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=36 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=211\u2013222 |doi=10.1016/0168-1591(93)90011-d}}</ref>\n[[File:\u0c15\u0c4b\u0c21\u0c3f \u0c2a\u0c3f\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32IMG20191207080730-01.jpg|thumb |right]]\n\n==== Broodiness ====\nUnder natural conditions, most birds lay only until a [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to \"go [[Broodiness|broody]]\".  The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12&nbsp;eggs). She will \"sit\" or \"set\" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe. While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest. To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.\n[[File:1911 EB Chicken skull.png|thumb|left|200px|Skull of a three-week-old chicken.

However, other breeds, such as the [[Cochin (chicken)|Cochin]], [[Cornish (chicken)|Cornish]] and [[Silkie (chicken)|Silkie]], do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species \u2014 even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as [[quail]], [[pheasant]]s, [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]], or [[Goose|geese]].\n\n{{clear}}\n==== Hatching and early life ====\nFertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.<ref name=\"grandin69\"/> Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so.  Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by \"pipping\"; pecking a breathing hole with its [[egg tooth]] towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side.  The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell).  The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid.  The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet [[Down feather|down]] dries out in the warmth of the nest.\n\nHens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal [[yolk sac]]. Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ali |first1=A. |last2=Cheng |first2=K.M. |year=1985 |title=Early egg production in genetically blind (rc/rc) chickens in comparison with sighted (Rc+/rc) controls |journal=Poultry Science |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=789\u2013794 |doi=10.3382/ps.0640789 |pmid=4001066}}</ref> Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night.

In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the [[Arauco Peninsula]] in [[Zona Sur|south-central Chile]]. Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070604/full/447620b.html DNA reveals how the chicken crossed the sea] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011153623/http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070604/full/447620b.html |date=October 11, 2007 }} Brendan Borrell, ''Nature'', June 5, 2007.

In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal.

Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1&nbsp;\u00b0C (1.8&nbsp;\u00b0F) from the optimum temperature of {{convert|37.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. [[Relative humidity]] should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren't turned, the [[embryo]] inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the [[embryo]] with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation.\n\nMany commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process. Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp.\n\n== Diseases and ailments ==\nChickens are susceptible to several [[parasite]]s, including [[lice]], [[mite]]s, [[tick]]s, [[flea]]s, and [[Roundworm|intestinal worms]], as well as other diseases.  Despite the name, they are not affected by [[chickenpox]], which is generally restricted to humans.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1750-3639.2001.tb00416.x |last1=White |first1=T.

A chicken is considered a channel for [[evil spirit]]s which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life.\n\nIn [[ancient Greece]], chickens were not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because they were still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of [[Ares]], [[Heracles]], and [[Athena]]. The alleged last words of [[Socrates]] as he died from [[conium|hemlock]] poisoning, as recounted by [[Plato]], were \"[[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], I owe a cock to [[Asclepius]]; will you remember to pay the debt?\", signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life.\n\nThe Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters. Several of [[Aesop's Fables]] reference this belief.\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], Jesus prophesied the betrayal by [[Saint Peter|Peter]]: \"Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.'\"<ref>[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:34</ref> It happened,<ref>[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:61</ref> and Peter cried bitterly. This made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal.\n\nEarlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about [[Jerusalem]]: \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.\"<ref>[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:37; also Luke 13:34.

Tilton \"[http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/12933/ Chickens and the Cultural Context of the Gospels] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808033636/http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/12933/ |date=August 8, 2014 }}\" [http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/ www.jerusalemperspective.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802235120/http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/ |date=August 2, 2014 }}.</ref>\n\nIn the sixth century, [[Pope Gregory I]] declared the rooster the emblem of Christianity<ref>The Antiquary: a magazine devoted to the study of the past, Volume 17 edited by [[Edward Walford]], [[John Charles Cox]], George Latimer Apperson \u2013 page 202</ref> and another Papal enactment of the ninth century by [[Pope Nicholas I]]<ref name=\"smithsonianmag.com\" /> ordered the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church steeple.<ref>''The Philadelphia Museum bulletin'', Volumes 1-5, Pennsylvania Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, p 14, 1906</ref>\n\nIn many Central European [[Folklore|folk tales]], the [[devil]] is believed to flee at the first crowing of a rooster.\n\nIn traditional [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish]] practice, a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called [[kapparos]]; it is now common practice to cradle the bird and move him or her around the head. A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person's sins in kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God's hands.\n\nThe [[Talmud]] speaks of learning \"courtesy toward one's mate\" from the rooster.<ref>Eruvin 100b.</ref> This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first.  A rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked. The [[Talmud]] likewise provides us with the statement \"Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks\",<ref>A Treasury of [[Jew]]ish Quotations By Joseph L. Baron \u2013 1985</ref><ref>Jonathan ben Nappaha. [[Talmud]]: Erubin 100b</ref> which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of \"a girt one of the loins\" ([[Young's Literal Translation]]) that which is \"stately in his stride\" and \"move with stately bearing\" in the [[Book of Proverbs]] 30:29-31 as referenced by [[Michael V. Fox]] in his ''Proverbs'' 10-31 where Sa\u02bbadiah ben Yosef Gaon ([[Saadia Gaon]]) identifies the definitive trait of \"A cock girded about the loins\" in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:31 ([[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible]]) as \"the honesty of their behavior and their success\",<ref>PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18, Michael V. Fox, Yale University Press 2009, 704 pages</ref> identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use.\n\nThe chicken is one of the symbols of the [[Chinese Zodiac]]. In [[Chinese folk religion]], a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian deities such as the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] are not recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with \"serious\" prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In [[Confucian]] Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g., sudden death) to attend the ceremony.

It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet [[Apicius]] offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the recipes include the [[stomach]], liver, [[testicle]]s and even the [[pygostyle]] (the fatty \"tail\" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach).\n\nThe Roman author [[Columella]] gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise, ''De Re Rustica'' (On Agriculture). He identified Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for [[cockfighting]] by the Greeks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.4). For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.13). Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages.\n\nAccording to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.7), the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by [[eagles]] or [[goshawks]]. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male hatchlings, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings (''De Re Rustica'' 8.5.11).\n\nColumella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals and \"poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke\" (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.1).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uCVOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=Per+Columella,+chicken+coops#v=onepage&q=Per+Columella,+chicken+coops&f=false|title=The New England Farmer|date=March 13, 2019|page=69|publisher=Thomas W.

Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths.\n\nAccording to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.4.1), chickens should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (''Lolium'' sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (''Medicago sativa'' L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the [[winter solstice]], in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.\n\nColumella<ref>{{Cite book |title=On agriculture, volume II: books 5\u20139 |last=ES Forster, EH Heffner |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1954 |isbn=978-0674994485 |location=The Loeb Classical Library |pages=355}}</ref> advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years, those that aren't productive or are poor care-takers of their eggs, and particularly those that eat their own and other hens' eggs.\n\nAccording to Aldrovandi, capons were produced by burning \"the hind part of the bowels, or loins or spurs\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3fMkPVL1KF4C&pg=PA278&lpg=PA278&dq=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron#v=onepage&q=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron&f=false|title=The Wisdom of Birds: An Illustrated History of Ornithology|first=Tim|last=Birkhead|page=278|date=March 13, 2019|publisher=Bloomsbury|accessdate=March 13, 2019|via=Google Books|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913140939/https://books.google.com/books?id=3fMkPVL1KF4C&pg=PA278&lpg=PA278&dq=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron&source=bl&ots=ulBRruboVR&sig=UgJy-zQT0EAjOEaguDrqH9jYzCQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1n1LUN6FK-G8yAGMi4DYAQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Capons+were+produced+by+burning+out+their+spurs+with+a+hot+iron&f=false|archive-date=September 13, 2016|url-status=live|isbn=9780747598220}}</ref> with a hot iron.
