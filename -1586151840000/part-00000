When Vivian was nine years old, her parents and two siblings are murdered by two hunters who then burn down their family house.\n\nOrphaned, Vivian moves back to Bucharest to live with her aunt, Astrid who also owns a chocolate store in Bucharest, Romania ([[Katja Riemann]]). Astrid is the former mate of the werewolf pack's leader, Gabriel ([[Olivier Martinez]]). To Astrid's distress, Gabriel leaves her after seven years to choose a new mate, in accordance with pack law but once in a while Gabriel returns to sleep with Astrid. Resulting with Astrid remaining painfully in love with Gabriel. Vivian is disgusted by his actions stating to Gabriel \"you come for one day and she cries for a month\". Gabriel reveals that he wants the reluctant Vivian as his mate. This is due to a prophecy foretold of a women who will bring about a \"new age of hope\" for the wolf pack. Gabriel believes Vivian is that woman.\n\nDuring one of her many late night strolls through the city Vivian breaks into a secured church where she encounters graphic novelist Aiden, who also broke into the church to draw figure studies for the covers of his novels. Aiden is also researching Vivian's kind, the Loups-Garoux (werewolves) for his latest novel. Although Aiden is human Vivian begins a romantic relationship with him. Aiden reveals to Vivian that he can never go home to America because he his wanted for assaulting, in self-defense, his military father. To escape being prosecuted he fled to Europe and began writing novels to which he does not put his name on. Vivian tells Aiden that her family died in America, but does not reveal why and what she is.\n\nTheir romance is closely monitored by Vivian's cousin Rafe ([[Bryan Dick]]) and his friends Ulf ([[Chris Geere]]), Gregor ([[Tom Harper (actor)|Tom Harper]]), Finn ([[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]]), and Willem (Jack Wilson), together known as \"The Five.\" Due to being Gabriel's son Rafe along with The Five often breaks the pack rules but Gabriel discreetly overlooks Rafe's behavior though occasionally threatens to punish him. Rafe displays micro-aggression towards Vivian due to Gabriel's intentions for her. Rafe is still angry with Gabriel for leaving his mother, Astrid, for another mate. During a visit to the chocolatier shop where Vivian works Rafe sees a drawing that Aiden has made of Vivian, in which she is referred to as \"The Wolf Girl.\" Believing that she is telling Aiden all of their pack's secrets and that she may become a danger to the pack, Rafe tells Gabriel about Aiden. Gabriel then tells Rafe to use any means, bribery or threatening, to make Aiden leave the city or he will die.\n\nRafe lures Aiden to an abandoned church with the ruse that Vivian wants to reconnect and attempts to scare him away. When this doesn't work, Rafe attacks Aiden, but Aiden defends himself and forces Rafe to back onto a table where he hits his head. Rafe angrily yells and leaps at Aiden while displaying his piercing two colored eyes. After fighting, Aiden attempts to run away but Rafe blocks his path and changes into a wolf. Attempting to bite Aiden, Rafe instead bites into a silver pendant around Aiden's neck. Resulting with Rafe backing off while sneezing. Aiden realizes the myths of the Loup-Garoux are real. Aiden grabs the silver pendant and charges at Rafe, both falling off a balcony railing onto the church floor. Aiden regains consciousness and sees Rafe dying, from the silver pendant on top his neck, in human form. Aiden grabs his silver pendant off of Rafe's body and leaves the church.\n\nAfterwards, Aiden confronts Vivian about her true identity and tempts her to hold the silver pendant. Aiden tells Vivian that he killed Rafe. Aiden yells at Vivian for not telling him the truth and exposing him to danger.\nVivian does not immediately tell Astrid about Rafe's death. Meanwhile, The Five, who had been searching for the missing Rafe, discovers his body at the abandon church. They take Rafe's body to Gabriel. A saddened Gabriel reveals the news to Astrid while Vivian watches. Aiden is eventually captured, while trying to leave the city by train, by two Loups-Garoux posing as police officers.\n\nThe pack gathers in the forest where Gabriel presents Aiden as Rafe's killer and their intended prey. Vivian immediately accuses Gabriel of knowingly sending Rafe to his death over her. Gabriel retorts that Vivian has betrayed the pack and their secrets. Gabriel forces Vivian to wish Aiden well by kiss and has Vivian placed in the back of a car to be dealt with later. Gabriel cuts Aiden's wrist and snatches off his silver pendant. Gabriel tells Aiden that if he makes it to the river at the edge of the forest he will be safe and then forces him to run. Aiden sees the Loups-Garoux pack's eyes glow yellow as he runs into the forest. Vivian escapes from the car and runs into the forest as a wolf to save Aiden. Aiden makes it to the river by confusing the pack, using his blood to spread his scent and making it harder for them to track him. Gabriel, angry that Aiden has escaped, attempts to follow him to kill him anyway. Vivian protects Aiden by fighting Gabriel but almost loses until Gabriel falls off bank of the river. Not recognizing Vivian in wolf form, Aiden strikes her with a silver knife. Vivian, slowly morphing back to human form, starts to bleed, quickly requiring an antidote to silver poisoning or else she will die.\n\nVivian takes Aiden to an abandoned film company building, she tells Aiden that the film is made of silver and once it absorbs into the bloodstream it stays there. Which guarantees no one will look for them there. Vivian tells Aiden that her family was killed because two hunters followed her wolf tracks back to their cabin. Vivian has felt guilty ever since then, and fears what Aiden would think of her. Aiden tempts Vivian with his blood telling her that she can control the wolf. Later Astrid arrives at the building with a gun to kill Aiden. Vivian pleads with Astrid not kill Aiden, telling her that Aiden is her first love and she should understand what it's like to lose a soulmate. Astrid relents and gives Vivian her gun for protection. Vivian tells Astrid that they are going to the pharmacist for an antidote and then leave the city.\n\nThe pharmacist provides Vivian with the antidote but also alerts Gabriel. After being chased, Vivian tells Aiden to save himself and then is captured by the pack herself. She is held in a cage and taunted by the rest of The Five while Gabriel attempts to manipulate her to his way of thinking. Meanwhile, Aiden forces the pharmacist at gun point to give him all of his antidotes, silver dust and bullets. Aiden comes to Vivian's rescue and, in the end, Vivian kills Gabriel and helps the remaining members of the The Five to escape the building fire while telling them \"may you know the new age of hope when you see it\".\n\nTo prevent themselves from being captured again Vivian suggest they take Gabriel's car. Aiden and Vivian drive out the city towards Paris, passing other Loups-Garoux, who bare their necks in respect, believing that it is Gabriel in the car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Agnes Bruckner]] as Vivian Gandillon\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as Aiden\n* [[Olivier Martinez]] as Gabriel\n* [[Katja Riemann]] as Astrid\n* [[Bryan Dick]] as Rafe\n* [[Chris Geere]] as Ulf\n* [[Tom Harper (actor)|Tom Harper]] as Gregor\n* [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] as Finn\n* Jack Wilson as Willem\n* Vitalie Ursu as Constani\n* Bogdan Voda as Albu\n* [[Kata Dob\u00f3]] as Beatrice\n* [[Maria Dinulescu]] as Girl in Red\n* Mihai Gruia Sandu as Pharmacist\n}}\n\n==Production==\nBeginning in 1997, a series of five directors entered into talks to direct ''Blood & Chocolate'' before Katja von Garnier finally decided to work on the film in January 2005. Larry Williams and his wife, [[Leslie Libman]], [[Po-Chih Leong]], [[Sanji Senaka]], and [[Rupert Wainwright]] were all considered. Throughout these talks, ''Blood and Chocolate'' author, [[Annette Curtis Klause]], was not kept up-to-date by the film's producers. Rather, she obtained information about film's progression from online sources.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cynthialeitichsmith.blogspot.com/2006/01/author-update-annette-curtis-klause.html | title = Interview with author Annette Curtis Klause }}</ref>\n\nThe book was originally adapted into a script by [[Christopher B. Landon|Christopher Landon]], whose father, [[Michael Landon]], had a leading role in the film ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'' (1957).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://katja-von-garnier.de/deutsch/film_blood_and_chocolate.htm | title = ''Blood and Chocolate'' at director's site (de icon) }}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] was set in the historic section of Bucharest and at [[MediaPro Studios]] in [[Buftea]]. However, the film failed to accurately represent the city of Bucharest. For example, the film's [[Piata Romana]] (Romana Square) is actually the [[Curtea Veche]] yard (Old Court), and the film's Biserica Silvestru (Silvestru Church, located in downtown Bucharest) is actually a church in Stirbey Palace, Buftea, which is located tens of kilometers west of Bucharest.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Blood & Chocolate: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}\nThe [[Film score|film's score]] was composed by [[Reinhold Heil]] and [[Johnny Klimek]]. The soundtrack consists of 15 songs, none of which are featured in the film.\n;Songs featured in the film\n# \"Garab\" - [[Rachid Taha]]\n# \"Let Yourself Go Wild\" - [[Jasmin Tabatabai]]\n# \"Velvet Hills\" - [[Katja Riemann]]\n# \"You Know the Truth\" - Aurah\n# \"Cash Machine\" - [[Hard-Fi]]\n# \"Amor Fati\" - Aurah\n# \"Silence Summons You\" - The Sofa Club\n# \"Eu Te Iubesc Prea Mult\" - [[Nicolae Guta]]\n# \"[[Stand My Ground]]\" - [[Within Temptation]]\n\n==Variation from novel==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}The film has significant differences from the plot and characters presented in [[Annette Curtis Klause]]'s 1997 [[young adult fiction|young adult]] [[Blood and Chocolate (novel)|novel of the same name]].\n\nIn the film, Vivian and Aiden are portrayed older than their characters in the novel, and meet under different circumstances. In the novel, they both attend the same high school, and Vivian seeks Aiden out after reading a poem he wrote about werewolves.\n\nIn the film, Gabriel is portrayed as an aggressive antagonist, ruling by force and fear. In the novel, he is a new addition to the pack, and wins his mantle of leadership in the Ordeal according to the Old Way.\n\nAdditionally, the relationship between Gabriel and Vivian in the novel is vastly different from how it is depicted in the film, and the nature of the Loups-Garoux is more bloodthirsty and vengeful towards humans in the film.\n\nSeveral other details are distinctly different in the film adaptation. Vivian's background story is changed, as well as the fate of her family.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Blood & Chocolate'' opened on January 26, 2007 in 1,200 theaters.

When Vivian was nine years old, her parents and two siblings are murdered by two hunters who then burn down their family house.\n\nOrphaned, Vivian moves back to Bucharest to live with her aunt, Astrid who also owns a chocolate store in Bucharest, Romania ([[Katja Riemann]]). Astrid is the former mate of the werewolf pack's leader, Gabriel ([[Olivier Martinez]]). To Astrid's distress, Gabriel leaves her after seven years to choose a new mate, in accordance with pack law but once in a while Gabriel returns to sleep with Astrid. Resulting with Astrid remaining painfully in love with Gabriel. Vivian is disgusted by his actions stating to Gabriel \"you come for one day and she cries for a month\". Gabriel reveals that he wants the reluctant Vivian as his mate. This is due to a prophecy foretold of a women who will bring about a \"new age of hope\" for the wolf pack. Gabriel believes Vivian is that woman.\n\nDuring one of her many late night strolls through the city Vivian breaks into a secured church where she encounters graphic novelist Aiden, who also broke into the church to draw figure studies for the covers of his novels. Aiden is also researching Vivian's kind, the Loups-Garoux (werewolves) for his latest novel. Although Aiden is human Vivian begins a romantic relationship with him. Aiden reveals to Vivian that he can never go home to America because he his wanted for assaulting, in self-defense, his military father. To escape being prosecuted he fled to Europe and began writing novels to which he does not put his name on. Vivian tells Aiden that her family died in America, but does not reveal why and what she is.\n\nTheir romance is closely monitored by Vivian's cousin Rafe ([[Bryan Dick]]) and his friends Ulf ([[Chris Geere]]), Gregor ([[Tom Harper (actor)|Tom Harper]]), Finn ([[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]]), and Willem (Jack Wilson), together known as \"The Five.\" Due to being Gabriel's son Rafe along with The Five often breaks the pack rules but Gabriel discreetly overlooks Rafe's behavior though occasionally threatens to punish him. Rafe displays micro-aggression towards Vivian due to Gabriel's intentions for her. Rafe is still angry with Gabriel for leaving his mother, Astrid, for another mate. During a visit to the chocolatier shop where Vivian works Rafe sees a drawing that Aiden has made of Vivian, in which she is referred to as \"The Wolf Girl.\" Believing that she is telling Aiden all of their pack's secrets and that she may become a danger to the pack, Rafe tells Gabriel about Aiden. Gabriel then tells Rafe to use any means, bribery or threatening, to make Aiden leave the city or he will die.\n\nRafe lures Aiden to an abandoned church with the ruse that Vivian wants to reconnect and attempts to scare him away. When this doesn't work, Rafe attacks Aiden, but Aiden defends himself and forces Rafe to back onto a table where he hits his head. Rafe angrily yells and leaps at Aiden while displaying his piercing two colored eyes. After fighting, Aiden attempts to run away but Rafe blocks his path and changes into a wolf. Attempting to bite Aiden, Rafe instead bites into a silver pendant around Aiden's neck. Resulting with Rafe backing off while sneezing. Aiden realizes the myths of the Loup-Garoux are real. Aiden grabs the silver pendant and charges at Rafe, both falling off a balcony railing onto the church floor. Aiden regains consciousness and sees Rafe dying, from the silver pendant on top his neck, in human form. Aiden grabs his silver pendant off of Rafe's body and leaves the church.\n\nAfterwards, Aiden confronts Vivian about her true identity and tempts her to hold the silver pendant. Aiden tells Vivian that he killed Rafe. Aiden yells at Vivian for not telling him the truth and exposing him to danger.\nVivian does not immediately tell Astrid about Rafe's death. Meanwhile, The Five, who had been searching for the missing Rafe, discovers his body at the abandon church. They take Rafe's body to Gabriel. A saddened Gabriel reveals the news to Astrid while Vivian watches. Aiden is eventually captured, while trying to leave the city by train, by two Loups-Garoux posing as police officers.\n\nThe pack gathers in the forest where Gabriel presents Aiden as Rafe's killer and their intended prey. Vivian immediately accuses Gabriel of knowingly sending Rafe to his death over her. Gabriel retorts that Vivian has betrayed the pack and their secrets. Gabriel forces Vivian to wish Aiden well by kiss and has Vivian placed in the back of a car to be dealt with later. Gabriel cuts Aiden's wrist and snatches off his silver pendant. Gabriel tells Aiden that if he makes it to the river at the edge of the forest he will be safe and then forces him to run. Aiden sees the Loups-Garoux pack's eyes glow yellow as he runs into the forest. Vivian escapes from the car and runs into the forest as a wolf to save Aiden. Aiden makes it to the river by confusing the pack, using his blood to spread his scent and making it harder for them to track him. Gabriel, angry that Aiden has escaped, attempts to follow him to kill him anyway. Vivian protects Aiden by fighting Gabriel but almost loses until Gabriel falls off bank of the river. Not recognizing Vivian in wolf form, Aiden strikes her with a silver knife. Vivian, slowly morphing back to human form, starts to bleed, quickly requiring an antidote to silver poisoning or else she will die.\n\nVivian takes Aiden to an abandoned film company building, she tells Aiden that the film is made of silver and once it absorbs into the bloodstream it stays there. Which guarantees no one will look for them there. Vivian tells Aiden that her family was killed because two hunters followed her wolf tracks back to their cabin. Vivian has felt guilty ever since then, and fears what Aiden would think of her. Aiden tempts Vivian with his blood telling her that she can control the wolf. Later Astrid arrives at the building with a gun to kill Aiden. Vivian pleads with Astrid not kill Aiden, telling her that Aiden is her first love and she should understand what it's like to lose a soulmate. Astrid relents and gives Vivian her gun for protection. Vivian tells Astrid that they are going to the pharmacist for an antidote and then leave the city.\n\nThe pharmacist provides Vivian with the antidote but also alerts Gabriel. After being chased, Vivian tells Aiden to save himself and then is captured by the pack herself. She is held in a cage and taunted by the rest of The Five while Gabriel attempts to manipulate her to his way of thinking. Meanwhile, Aiden forces the pharmacist at gun point to give him all of his antidotes, silver dust and bullets. Aiden comes to Vivian's rescue and, in the end, Vivian kills Gabriel and helps the remaining members of the The Five to escape the building fire while telling them \"may you know the new age of hope when you see it\".\n\nTo prevent themselves from being captured again Vivian suggest they take Gabriel's car. Aiden and Vivian drive out the city towards Paris, passing other Loups-Garoux, who bare their necks in respect, believing that it is Gabriel in the car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Agnes Bruckner]] as Vivian Gandillon\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as Aiden\n* [[Olivier Martinez]] as Gabriel\n* [[Katja Riemann]] as Astrid\n* [[Bryan Dick]] as Rafe\n* [[Chris Geere]] as Ulf\n* [[Tom Harper (actor)|Tom Harper]] as Gregor\n* [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] as Finn\n* Jack Wilson as Willem\n* Vitalie Ursu as Constani\n* Bogdan Voda as Albu\n* [[Kata Dob\u00f3]] as Beatrice\n* [[Maria Dinulescu]] as Girl in Red\n* Mihai Gruia Sandu as Pharmacist\n}}\n\n==Production==\nBeginning in 1997, a series of five directors entered into talks to direct ''Blood & Chocolate'' before Katja von Garnier finally decided to work on the film in January 2005. Larry Williams and his wife, [[Leslie Libman]], [[Po-Chih Leong]], [[Sanji Senaka]], and [[Rupert Wainwright]] were all considered. Throughout these talks, ''Blood and Chocolate'' author, [[Annette Curtis Klause]], was not kept up-to-date by the film's producers. Rather, she obtained information about film's progression from online sources.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cynthialeitichsmith.blogspot.com/2006/01/author-update-annette-curtis-klause.html | title = Interview with author Annette Curtis Klause }}</ref>\n\nThe book was originally adapted into a script by [[Christopher B. Landon|Christopher Landon]], whose father, [[Michael Landon]], had a leading role in the film ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'' (1957).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://katja-von-garnier.de/deutsch/film_blood_and_chocolate.htm | title = ''Blood and Chocolate'' at director's site (de icon) }}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] was set in the historic section of Bucharest and at [[MediaPro Studios]] in [[Buftea]]. However, the film failed to accurately represent the city of Bucharest. For example, the film's [[Piata Romana]] (Romana Square) is actually the [[Curtea Veche]] yard (Old Court), and the film's Biserica Silvestru (Silvestru Church, located in downtown Bucharest) is actually a church in Stirbey Palace, Buftea, which is located tens of kilometers west of Bucharest.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Blood & Chocolate: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}\nThe [[Film score|film's score]] was composed by [[Reinhold Heil]] and [[Johnny Klimek]].

In the novel, they both attend the same high school, and Vivian seeks Aiden out after reading a poem he wrote about werewolves.\n\nIn the film, Gabriel is portrayed as an aggressive antagonist, ruling by force and fear. In the novel, he is a new addition to the pack, and wins his mantle of leadership in the Ordeal according to the Old Way.\n\nAdditionally, the relationship between Gabriel and Vivian in the novel is vastly different from how it is depicted in the film, and the nature of the Loups-Garoux is more bloodthirsty and vengeful towards humans in the film.\n\nSeveral other details are distinctly different in the film adaptation. Vivian's background story is changed, as well as the fate of her family.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Blood & Chocolate'' opened on January 26, 2007 in 1,200 theaters.

It was necessary to provide some sort of editor, so IBM chose to adapt and substantially extend its OS/2 System Editor (1986),<ref>{{ cite web | title = Software Prototypes and Implementations | url = http://evolutionarymedia.com/davis/resume/software.htm#os2sysed | author = Davis Foulger | accessdate = 2007-01-12 }}</ref> a minimally functional member of the E family of Editors.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Software Prototypes and Implementations | url = http://evolutionarymedia.com/davis/resume/software.htm#efamily | author = Davis Foulger | accessdate = 2007-01-12 }}</ref> The [[DOS]] version is extended with a wide array of functions that are usually associated with more functional versions of the E editor family (see below).  In version 7, IBM added the [[REXX]] language to DOS, restoring programmability to the basic box.  [[IBM]] also provided E with [[OS/2]].\n\n==Features==\nThe features include (for PC DOS 7):\n\n*online help\n*edit large text files\n*draw boxes around text\n*mouse and menu support\n*record and play keystroke macros\n*change case within a marked area\n*access multiple files in multiple panes\n*syntax-directed editing of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[REXX]]\n*add and multiply numbers in a marked area\n*locate and make a change globally within a file\n*select text and move, copy, overlay, or delete it\n*copy and move text from one file into another file\n\nE for PC DOS consists of five files:\n\n* <code>E.EXE</code> -- the executable program itself, (v3.13 in PC DOS 7)\n* <code>E.EX</code> -- pre-compiled profile for E's behavior\n* <code>E.INI</code> -- text file allowing modification of a few <code>E.EX</code> defaults (Not in v 3.12 (dos 6))\n* <code>EHELP.HLP</code> -- text file used for E's '''F1''' key help in Browse (read-only) mode\n* <code>BROWSE.COM</code> -- loads a file into E in read-only mode.  (Not in v 3.12 (dos 6))\n\nSince no tool was provided for building other profiles besides the supplied <code>E.EX</code>, PC DOS users have limited access to the full extensibility offered by the version 3 of E (e3) available to IBM programmers themselves.  Still, it is a powerful implementation, with many features supporting the needs of general programmers.\n\nFor PC DOS owners who have moved on to other operating systems, E can be run with the use of a DOS emulator (e.g. [[DOSBox]]) or with  DOS [[Cross-platform virtualization|virtualization]] software (e.g. [[DOSEMU]] or [[NTVDM]]).  E runs quite successfully under the Windows NT 32-bit DOS prompt, for example.\n\n==E family==\nThe history of the PC DOS version of E begins with [[Personal Editor]], a key configurable editor that enabled limited programming using a [[IBM Generalized Markup Language|GML]]-like language.  Personal Editor was initially released in 1982 and became an IBM product not long after.\n\nLimitations in Personal Editor led to the development and release in 1984 of the E editor, a much faster editor that supported very long files and included a substantially enhanced user interface.  E2, released in 1985, provided enhanced programmability using a [[REXX]]-like language.  Its UI programmability was designed so flexibly that it was used to develop user interface prototypes for other kinds of software, including Word Processors and Survey software.  Subsequent versions, including E3, EOS2, and EPM, provided a wide range of other enhancements.  The OS/2 System Editor was developed by the E programming team at the request of the OS/2 Development team.  It was designed to be a fast and highly functional text editor with a minimal number of features and no configurability.  EPM was later released as the OS/2 Enhanced Editor.

It was necessary to provide some sort of editor, so IBM chose to adapt and substantially extend its OS/2 System Editor (1986),<ref>{{ cite web | title = Software Prototypes and Implementations | url = http://evolutionarymedia.com/davis/resume/software.htm#os2sysed | author = Davis Foulger | accessdate = 2007-01-12 }}</ref> a minimally functional member of the E family of Editors.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Software Prototypes and Implementations | url = http://evolutionarymedia.com/davis/resume/software.htm#efamily | author = Davis Foulger | accessdate = 2007-01-12 }}</ref> The [[DOS]] version is extended with a wide array of functions that are usually associated with more functional versions of the E editor family (see below).  In version 7, IBM added the [[REXX]] language to DOS, restoring programmability to the basic box.  [[IBM]] also provided E with [[OS/2]].\n\n==Features==\nThe features include (for PC DOS 7):\n\n*online help\n*edit large text files\n*draw boxes around text\n*mouse and menu support\n*record and play keystroke macros\n*change case within a marked area\n*access multiple files in multiple panes\n*syntax-directed editing of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[REXX]]\n*add and multiply numbers in a marked area\n*locate and make a change globally within a file\n*select text and move, copy, overlay, or delete it\n*copy and move text from one file into another file\n\nE for PC DOS consists of five files:\n\n* <code>E.EXE</code> -- the executable program itself, (v3.13 in PC DOS 7)\n* <code>E.EX</code> -- pre-compiled profile for E's behavior\n* <code>E.INI</code> -- text file allowing modification of a few <code>E.EX</code> defaults (Not in v 3.12 (dos 6))\n* <code>EHELP.HLP</code> -- text file used for E's '''F1''' key help in Browse (read-only) mode\n* <code>BROWSE.COM</code> -- loads a file into E in read-only mode.  (Not in v 3.12 (dos 6))\n\nSince no tool was provided for building other profiles besides the supplied <code>E.EX</code>, PC DOS users have limited access to the full extensibility offered by the version 3 of E (e3) available to IBM programmers themselves.  Still, it is a powerful implementation, with many features supporting the needs of general programmers.\n\nFor PC DOS owners who have moved on to other operating systems, E can be run with the use of a DOS emulator (e.g. [[DOSBox]]) or with  DOS [[Cross-platform virtualization|virtualization]] software (e.g. [[DOSEMU]] or [[NTVDM]]).  E runs quite successfully under the Windows NT 32-bit DOS prompt, for example.\n\n==E family==\nThe history of the PC DOS version of E begins with [[Personal Editor]], a key configurable editor that enabled limited programming using a [[IBM Generalized Markup Language|GML]]-like language.  Personal Editor was initially released in 1982 and became an IBM product not long after.\n\nLimitations in Personal Editor led to the development and release in 1984 of the E editor, a much faster editor that supported very long files and included a substantially enhanced user interface.  E2, released in 1985, provided enhanced programmability using a [[REXX]]-like language.  Its UI programmability was designed so flexibly that it was used to develop user interface prototypes for other kinds of software, including Word Processors and Survey software.  Subsequent versions, including E3, EOS2, and EPM, provided a wide range of other enhancements.  The OS/2 System Editor was developed by the E programming team at the request of the OS/2 Development team.  It was designed to be a fast and highly functional text editor with a minimal number of features and no configurability.  EPM was later released as the OS/2 Enhanced Editor.

The next step is the formation of a solid political base in order to generate effective legislative change, and thus the realization of animal law.  During the year 2013, events were organized, focusing on the need to mobilize the Brazilian legislature to attend to the issue of animals.  These meetings focused, both politically and legally, on the best means to support the animal law debate.  It is time to insert animal law into the curriculum of the Brazilian law schools. As a result, in 2014, Brasilia, the Brazilian political capital, will hold the fourth World Conference, with the theme Posthumanism: challenges and perspectives.

The next step is the formation of a solid political base in order to generate effective legislative change, and thus the realization of animal law.  During the year 2013, events were organized, focusing on the need to mobilize the Brazilian legislature to attend to the issue of animals.  These meetings focused, both politically and legally, on the best means to support the animal law debate.  It is time to insert animal law into the curriculum of the Brazilian law schools. As a result, in 2014, Brasilia, the Brazilian political capital, will hold the fourth World Conference, with the theme Posthumanism: challenges and perspectives.
