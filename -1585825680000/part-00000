The tributaries arising in these locations are generally known as the '''Willenhall arm''' and the '''Oldbury arm''' of the Tame. However, some of its tributary streams, including Waddens Brook, rise as far to the west and north as [[Bilston]] and [[Wednesfield]] in the city of [[Wolverhampton]]. Much of the course of the river has been modified over the centuries, and the urban sections now run mainly through culverts or canalised channels. Both arms of the Tame flow through the [[Black Country]] to their confluence at [[Bescot]], on the edge of Walsall.\n\n===The Willenhall or Wolverhampton arm===\nThe northern arm is easily traced from [[Bentley, West Midlands|Bentley]], near Willenhall. However, the SMURF project traces it back as far as Stow Heath, near [[Bilston]], where it is marked by a marshy patch at the northern end of the [[City of Wolverhampton College]]'s Wellington Road campus; hence, SMURF uses the term \"Wolverhampton arm\" for this section of the Tame. Victorian [[Ordnance Survey]] maps trace the sources of the Tame further back, to the site of the old Stow Heath colliery, which is now Wolverhampton's East Park.\n\nThe stream runs invisibly but generally north-eastward through Stowlawn, and then cuts across the southern edge of Willenhall, appearing briefly among the warehouses, and picking up reinforcement from the Waddens Brook, which originates in Wednesfield. It appears definitively at Watery Lane and Noose Lane, even more so at Bentley, where it runs southward through the industrial part of Bentley, before turning south-eastward, following a realigned course alongside and beneath the [[M6 motorway]], to Bescot.\n<gallery caption=\"The Willenhall or Woverhampton arm\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Tame at Willenhall.JPG|The Willenhall Arm, close to the source, among residential areas near Shepwell Green. The river is disclosed by the tiny area of reflection in the centre of the photograph - a small stream between overgrown banks, and almost inaccessible, although it forms the town's boundary.\nImage:Tame at Bentley Creen1.JPG|The Willenhall Arm at Bentley Green, Walsall, just after passing under the [[Black Country Route]].

It winds its way up through Langley and around the southern and eastern edges of Oldbury town centre, surfacing due south of [[Sandwell and Dudley railway station]], from which point it remains mainly on the surface and is easily traced. Bearing generally north-westward, it skirts [[Brades Village]] and flows into [[Tipton]]. Here it passes through [[Sheepwash Urban Park]] and [[Horseley Heath]] to the centre of [[Great Bridge, West Midlands|Great Bridge]]. Leaving Tipton, it then zig-zags across the southern and eastern parts of [[Wednesbury]], to meet the Willenhall or Wolverhampton arm at [[Bescot]].\n<gallery caption=\"The Oldbury arm\">\nFile:Tame entering Sheepwash.jpg|The Oldbury Arm of the Tame, close to where it enters [[Sheepwash Urban Park]], via a culvert under the [[West Coast Main Line]]. \nImage:Sheepwash Urban Park Tame bank.JPG|Oldbury Arm of the Tame close to its entrance to the Sheepwash Urban Park, between [[Great Bridge, West Midlands|Great Bridge]], [[Tipton]], and [[West Bromwich]].

It passes through [[Hamstead, West Midlands|Hamstead]] and [[Perry Hall Park]] to [[Perry Barr]], where it is crossed by the [[Perry Bridge]] of 1711, then through [[Witton, West Midlands|Witton]] and beneath both [[Gravelly Hill Interchange]] (where it is fed by the [[River Rea|Rea]]) and [[Bromford Viaduct]], to [[Washwood Heath]].\n{{Commons category|River Tame, West Midlands}}\n<gallery caption=\"Confluence to Sandwell Valley\" perrow=\"4\">\t\nImage:Tame Valley Aqueduct.JPG|Aqueduct carrying the [[Tame Valley Canal]] over the River Tame at Ray Hall.\nImage:Tame at Ray Hall.JPG|The Tame at Ray Hall sewage works, from the Tame Valley Canal aqueduct, with the Charlemont area of West Bromwich on the right.\nImage:Tame at M5 Interchange.JPG|The Tame flowing under the [[M5 motorway]] interchange with the [[M6 motorway]] northbound, after which it enters Sandwell Valley.\nImage:Tame banks upper Sandwell Valley.JPG|Steep, eroded banks of the Tame in upper part of [[Sandwell Valley]].\nImage:Tame Sandwell canalised.JPG|A canalised section of the Tame in Sandwell Valley, showing Forge Mill Lake to the right, separated from the river by a steep embankment.\nImage:Forge Mill sluices.JPG|Sluices controlling the flow of water into Forge Mill Lake, a storm water retention basin.\nImage:Tame Sandwell bridge.JPG|Bridge over the canalised section, linking the lake to Forge Mill Farm\nImage:Tame Sandwell riverbed.JPG|Bed and banks of the river, which is usually shallow and fast-flowing at this point.\nImage:Tame Sandwell Forge Mill.JPG|Forge Mill Lake.

At [[Hams Hall]], immediately after its confluence with the [[River Blythe]] and the little River Bourne, it turns sharply to take up a northward course, and soon feeds into the large complex of water purification lakes at [[Lea Marston]] that now make up [[Kingsbury Water Park]]. It then crosses into [[Staffordshire]], flowing through [[Middleton Lakes RSPB reserve]] in a wide valley between [[Drayton Bassett]] to the west and [[Dosthill]] to the east. It then flows under [[Watling Street]] to the east of [[Fazeley]], and under an [[Navigable aqueduct|aqueduct]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/703626|title=Canal aqueduct over River Tame (C) Rob Farrow|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}</ref> carrying the [[Coventry Canal]]. It continues northward to [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], which takes its name from the river, where it is joined by the [[River Anker]] immediately to the east of Lady Bridge beneath the strategically positioned [[Tamworth Castle]]. The river continues its generally northward route past [[Hopwas]], [[Comberford]] and [[Elford]] until it arrives at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]] where it forms the boundary between this and the [[Croxall Lakes]] Nature Reserve. After this, it flows under the railway at [[Wichnor Viaduct]] to its confluence with the [[River Trent|Trent]] near [[Alrewas]]. The eventual outflow is into the [[North Sea]], via the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. When the Tame and Trent meet, the Tame is the bigger river, the Trent effectively joining it as a tributary. However, the Trent being the ''longer'' river at that point is considered the more senior, and so the combined river bears its name.\n<gallery caption=\"The Lower Tame in Staffordshire\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:River Tame at Tamworth.jpg|The Tame at Tamworth, with Lady Bridge in the foreground and Tamworth Castle behind. \nImage:River Tame Hopwas.jpg|The Tame east of [[Hopwas]]\nImage:River Tame - geograph.org.uk - 122886.jpg|the Tame at [[Elford]], north of Tamworth.\nImage:Chetwynd Bridge.jpg|The Tame passing under Chetwynd Bridge near [[Alrewas]], designed by [[Joseph Potter (architect)|Joseph Potter]] in 1828.\nImage:Lower Tame pillbox.JPG|[[British hardened field defences of World War II|Pillbox]] on the west bank of the Tame, one of many defences constructed along the Midlands rivers during World War II.\nImage:Pillbox At NMA.jpg|Pillbox on the west bank of the River Tame\nImage:Tame Arboretum.JPG|The Tame at the edge of the [[National Memorial Arboretum]], with [[Croxall Lakes]] to the left.\nImage:Tame Trent confluence.JPG|Confluence of the Tame (right) with the [[River Trent]] (left), at the northern edge of the National Memorial Arboretum.\n</gallery>\n\nThe catchment of the Tame covers an area of nearly 1500&nbsp;km\u00b2 and contains a population of about 1.7 million people.

These result largely from the mainly urban character of the upper catchment. Rainfall runs off the roofs and hard surfaces, raising river levels very rapidly. Rapid house-building and commercial development may have exacerbated the problem in recent years. Another development contributing to worse flooding has been the general rise in groundwater levels in the upper catchment area. As traditional industries have declined and been replaced by light industries and services, far less water has been taken from the river and the underlying aquifer.<ref>[http://www.asiantaeth-yr-amgylchedd.cymru.gov.uk/yourenv/consultations/837013/?version=1&lang=_e.html Environment Agency, River Tame flood risk management scoping report] - 5: Key Issues, 2004, page 29,</ref>\n\nThe river is susceptible to spectacular flooding at the village of [[Hopwas]], between Tamworth and [[Lichfield]], during periods of heavy autumnal rain. The long-term persistence of the problem is attested by the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] meaning of the village's name:- ''hop'' - nook of land, ''was'' - watery. There is also a substantial bend in the course of the river between Hopwas and Elford, giving rise to the name ''Tamhorn'' for the area.\n\n=== Flood prevention ===\n[[File:Tame Sandwell Forge Mill.JPG|thumb|right|Forge Mill Lake]]\n\nFlood prevention work was carried out on [[Sandwell Valley]] in the 1980s. Forge Mill Lake was created as a stormwater retention basin by enlarging an existing depression. The river was dredged to deepen it and the gravel used to construct an island in the lake.<ref>C. Philip Wheater, Jo Wright: Urban Habitats, Routledge, London, 1999, p.125.</ref> This evolved into part of a nature reserve, at present leased to the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]]. At about the same time, a similar arrangement was constructed at [[Sheepwash Urban Park]], utilising old brickworks excavations as a storm water basin to relieve flooding by the Oldbury Arm.\n\nIn 2005, the river's alignment through [[Perry Hall Park]] in [[Perry Barr]], Birmingham, just downstream of Sandwell Valley, was remodelled to slow the flow, alleviate flooding and create improved [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s for [[wildlife]], as part of the [[Sustainable Management of Urban Rivers and Floodplains|SMURF]] (Sustainable Management of Urban Rivers and Floodplains) project.\n\nNonetheless, in June 2007, after heavy rain, the river burst its banks in the [[Witton, West Midlands|Witton]] area of Birmingham (just downstream of Perry Barr)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/6759603.stm |title=Trapped workers home after flood |date=16 June 2007 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=21 June 2008}}</ref> and at [[Kingsbury Water Park]].<ref name=flood>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/6227228.stm |title=UK &#124; England &#124; Coventry/Warwickshire &#124; Water park reopens after floods |work=BBC News |date=21 June 2007 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the [[Environment Agency]] held a public consultation on its proposed flood alleviation measures.<ref name=\"EA-2009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/library/consultations/107416.aspx |title=River Tame Flood Risk Management Strategy |work=Consultations |publisher=Environment Agency |accessdate=3 June 2009}}</ref> Subsequently, the Environment Agency undertook \u00a3380,000-worth of improvements, mainly involving dredging and clearing of obstacles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birminghamprepared.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/EA_River_Tame_Improvements_2010.pdf |title=Environment Agency: River Tame Improvement Works 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=29 June 2013}}</ref> 1000 tonnes of gravel were removed from around the Chester Road Bridge at Castle Vale and deposited further downstream to improve the fish spawning habitat.

The tributaries arising in these locations are generally known as the '''Willenhall arm''' and the '''Oldbury arm''' of the Tame. However, some of its tributary streams, including Waddens Brook, rise as far to the west and north as [[Bilston]] and [[Wednesfield]] in the city of [[Wolverhampton]]. Much of the course of the river has been modified over the centuries, and the urban sections now run mainly through culverts or canalised channels. Both arms of the Tame flow through the [[Black Country]] to their confluence at [[Bescot]], on the edge of Walsall.\n\n===The Willenhall or Wolverhampton arm===\nThe northern arm is easily traced from [[Bentley, West Midlands|Bentley]], near Willenhall. However, the SMURF project traces it back as far as Stow Heath, near [[Bilston]], where it is marked by a marshy patch at the northern end of the [[City of Wolverhampton College]]'s Wellington Road campus; hence, SMURF uses the term \"Wolverhampton arm\" for this section of the Tame. Victorian [[Ordnance Survey]] maps trace the sources of the Tame further back, to the site of the old Stow Heath colliery, which is now Wolverhampton's East Park.\n\nThe stream runs invisibly but generally north-eastward through Stowlawn, and then cuts across the southern edge of Willenhall, appearing briefly among the warehouses, and picking up reinforcement from the Waddens Brook, which originates in Wednesfield. It appears definitively at Watery Lane and Noose Lane, even more so at Bentley, where it runs southward through the industrial part of Bentley, before turning south-eastward, following a realigned course alongside and beneath the [[M6 motorway]], to Bescot.\n<gallery caption=\"The Willenhall or Woverhampton arm\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Tame at Willenhall.JPG|The Willenhall Arm, close to the source, among residential areas near Shepwell Green. The river is disclosed by the tiny area of reflection in the centre of the photograph - a small stream between overgrown banks, and almost inaccessible, although it forms the town's boundary.\nImage:Tame at Bentley Creen1.JPG|The Willenhall Arm at Bentley Green, Walsall, just after passing under the [[Black Country Route]].

It winds its way up through Langley and around the southern and eastern edges of Oldbury town centre, surfacing due south of [[Sandwell and Dudley railway station]], from which point it remains mainly on the surface and is easily traced. Bearing generally north-westward, it skirts [[Brades Village]] and flows into [[Tipton]]. Here it passes through [[Sheepwash Urban Park]] and [[Horseley Heath]] to the centre of [[Great Bridge, West Midlands|Great Bridge]]. Leaving Tipton, it then zig-zags across the southern and eastern parts of [[Wednesbury]], to meet the Willenhall or Wolverhampton arm at [[Bescot]].\n<gallery caption=\"The Oldbury arm\">\nFile:Tame entering Sheepwash.jpg|The Oldbury Arm of the Tame, close to where it enters [[Sheepwash Urban Park]], via a culvert under the [[West Coast Main Line]]. \nImage:Sheepwash Urban Park Tame bank.JPG|Oldbury Arm of the Tame close to its entrance to the Sheepwash Urban Park, between [[Great Bridge, West Midlands|Great Bridge]], [[Tipton]], and [[West Bromwich]].

It passes through [[Hamstead, West Midlands|Hamstead]] and [[Perry Hall Park]] to [[Perry Barr]], where it is crossed by the [[Perry Bridge]] of 1711, then through [[Witton, West Midlands|Witton]] and beneath both [[Gravelly Hill Interchange]] (where it is fed by the [[River Rea|Rea]]) and [[Bromford Viaduct]], to [[Washwood Heath]].\n{{Commons category|River Tame, West Midlands}}\n<gallery caption=\"Confluence to Sandwell Valley\" perrow=\"4\">\t\nImage:Tame Valley Aqueduct.JPG|Aqueduct carrying the [[Tame Valley Canal]] over the River Tame at Ray Hall.\nImage:Tame at Ray Hall.JPG|The Tame at Ray Hall sewage works, from the Tame Valley Canal aqueduct, with the Charlemont area of West Bromwich on the right.\nImage:Tame at M5 Interchange.JPG|The Tame flowing under the [[M5 motorway]] interchange with the [[M6 motorway]] northbound, after which it enters Sandwell Valley.\nImage:Tame banks upper Sandwell Valley.JPG|Steep, eroded banks of the Tame in upper part of [[Sandwell Valley]].\nImage:Tame Sandwell canalised.JPG|A canalised section of the Tame in Sandwell Valley, showing Forge Mill Lake to the right, separated from the river by a steep embankment.\nImage:Forge Mill sluices.JPG|Sluices controlling the flow of water into Forge Mill Lake, a storm water retention basin.\nImage:Tame Sandwell bridge.JPG|Bridge over the canalised section, linking the lake to Forge Mill Farm\nImage:Tame Sandwell riverbed.JPG|Bed and banks of the river, which is usually shallow and fast-flowing at this point.\nImage:Tame Sandwell Forge Mill.JPG|Forge Mill Lake.

At [[Hams Hall]], immediately after its confluence with the [[River Blythe]] and the little River Bourne, it turns sharply to take up a northward course, and soon feeds into the large complex of water purification lakes at [[Lea Marston]] that now make up [[Kingsbury Water Park]]. It then crosses into [[Staffordshire]], flowing through [[Middleton Lakes RSPB reserve]] in a wide valley between [[Drayton Bassett]] to the west and [[Dosthill]] to the east. It then flows under [[Watling Street]] to the east of [[Fazeley]], and under an [[Navigable aqueduct|aqueduct]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/703626|title=Canal aqueduct over River Tame (C) Rob Farrow|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}</ref> carrying the [[Coventry Canal]]. It continues northward to [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], which takes its name from the river, where it is joined by the [[River Anker]] immediately to the east of Lady Bridge beneath the strategically positioned [[Tamworth Castle]]. The river continues its generally northward route past [[Hopwas]], [[Comberford]] and [[Elford]] until it arrives at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]] where it forms the boundary between this and the [[Croxall Lakes]] Nature Reserve. After this, it flows under the railway at [[Wichnor Viaduct]] to its confluence with the [[River Trent|Trent]] near [[Alrewas]]. The eventual outflow is into the [[North Sea]], via the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. When the Tame and Trent meet, the Tame is the bigger river, the Trent effectively joining it as a tributary. However, the Trent being the ''longer'' river at that point is considered the more senior, and so the combined river bears its name.\n<gallery caption=\"The Lower Tame in Staffordshire\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:River Tame at Tamworth.jpg|The Tame at Tamworth, with Lady Bridge in the foreground and Tamworth Castle behind. \nImage:River Tame Hopwas.jpg|The Tame east of [[Hopwas]]\nImage:River Tame - geograph.org.uk - 122886.jpg|the Tame at [[Elford]], north of Tamworth.\nImage:Chetwynd Bridge.jpg|The Tame passing under Chetwynd Bridge near [[Alrewas]], designed by [[Joseph Potter (architect)|Joseph Potter]] in 1828.\nImage:Lower Tame pillbox.JPG|[[British hardened field defences of World War II|Pillbox]] on the west bank of the Tame, one of many defences constructed along the Midlands rivers during World War II.\nImage:Pillbox At NMA.jpg|Pillbox on the west bank of the River Tame\nImage:Tame Arboretum.JPG|The Tame at the edge of the [[National Memorial Arboretum]], with [[Croxall Lakes]] to the left.\nImage:Tame Trent confluence.JPG|Confluence of the Tame (right) with the [[River Trent]] (left), at the northern edge of the National Memorial Arboretum.\n</gallery>\n\nThe catchment of the Tame covers an area of nearly 1500&nbsp;km\u00b2 and contains a population of about 1.7 million people. Approximately 42% of the Tame basin is urbanised, making it the most heavily urbanised [[river basin]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sediment Dynamics and the Hydromorphology of Fluvial Systems |first=John S. |last=Rowan |first2=R.

These result largely from the mainly urban character of the upper catchment. Rainfall runs off the roofs and hard surfaces, raising river levels very rapidly. Rapid house-building and commercial development may have exacerbated the problem in recent years. Another development contributing to worse flooding has been the general rise in groundwater levels in the upper catchment area. As traditional industries have declined and been replaced by light industries and services, far less water has been taken from the river and the underlying aquifer.<ref>[http://www.asiantaeth-yr-amgylchedd.cymru.gov.uk/yourenv/consultations/837013/?version=1&lang=_e.html Environment Agency, River Tame flood risk management scoping report] - 5: Key Issues, 2004, page 29,</ref>\n\nThe river is susceptible to spectacular flooding at the village of [[Hopwas]], between Tamworth and [[Lichfield]], during periods of heavy autumnal rain. The long-term persistence of the problem is attested by the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] meaning of the village's name:- ''hop'' - nook of land, ''was'' - watery. There is also a substantial bend in the course of the river between Hopwas and Elford, giving rise to the name ''Tamhorn'' for the area.\n\n=== Flood prevention ===\n[[File:Tame Sandwell Forge Mill.JPG|thumb|right|Forge Mill Lake]]\n\nFlood prevention work was carried out on [[Sandwell Valley]] in the 1980s.

The top photo is of Ramendranarayan Roy Claimantand the bottom photo is of the Claimant as sanyasi.]]\n'''Ramendra Narayan Roy''' was one of the [[kumar]]s (\"prince\") of the [[Bhawal Estate]], a large [[zamindari]] in [[Bengal]] in modern-day [[Bangladesh]]. He was one of three brothers who had inherited the estate from their father. He was popularly known to people as \"mejokumar\". The Bhawal Estate spread over {{convert|579|sqmi|km2}} and included villages with a population of around 500,000, many of them tenant farmers.The second son Ramendranarayan Roy (b.28 July 1884) was yet to take up the zamindari management when the famous incident of the Bhawal Case took place.\n\nRamendra Narayan Roy, second kumar of Bhawal, spent most of his time hunting, in festivities, and with women, having several mistresses. By 1905 he was said to have contracted [[syphilis]]. In 1909 he went to [[Darjeeling]] to seek treatment, accompanied by his wife Bibhabati Devi, her brother Satyendranath Banerjee, and a large retinue, but was reported to have died there on 7 May at the age of 25.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bhawal_Case|title=Bhawal Case|last=Islam|first=Sirajul|date=|website=[[Banglapedia]]|publisher=Bangladesh Asiatic Society|access-date=}}</ref> The reported cause of death was biliary colic ([[gallstones]]).

Some witnesses testified that a sudden hailstorm had interrupted the cremation just before the pyre should have been lighted and the body might have disappeared when the mourners had sought shelter.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nHis young wife Bibhabati Devi moved to [[Dhaka]] to live with her brother Satyen Banerjee. Over the next ten years the other Bhawal Estate kumars also died and the colonial British [[Court of Wards (India)|Court of Wards]] took control of the estate on behalf of their widows.\n\n[ Regarding the family name, long before the beginning of British Raj in Bharotborsho (India) 'Baro Bhuiya' (\u09e7\u09e8) (\u09ac\u09be\u09b0\u09cb \u09ad\u09c1\u0981\u0987\u09af\u09bc\u09be) or (12 great land lords) ruled over the lands of what was then known as Bangladesh (including current day West Bengal, Bangla Desh, Assam, Tripura, parts of modern-day Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha). The Bhawals were descended from one of the Baro Bhuiyan families. There was a custom among the Zamindari families of those days of acquiring high sounding titles like Roy etc., and Ramendra Narayan Roy's surname of Roy was in fact a title. His original surname was Bhawal.]\n\n== Rumors and return ==\nIn 1920, a sanyasi appeared in [[Buckland Bund]] in Dhaka covered in ashes.<ref name=\":0\" /> He sat on the street for four months and attracted attention because he was of unusually good physical stature. There were rumours that the second kumar had returned, even when the man said that he had renounced his family. Buddhu, the son of an elder sister of the brothers, visited him but was not convinced. Some of the locals arranged for the man's visit to [[Joydebpur railway station|Joydebpur]] where he arrived on 12 April 1921 on an elephant. Under public pressure, the [[Sanyasa|sanyasi]] finally disclosed that he was Ramendranarayan Roy, the raja of Bhawal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe sanyasi claimed that while in Darjeeling he was poisoned and a cremation was attempted. But the people hired to cremate the raja left his body unattended and not cremated because a strong hailstorm had started raging at that time.<ref name=\":0\" /> A group of [[Sanyasa|naga sanyasis]] found him lying unconscious, took him to their abode and nursed him back to recovery. He recovered, but had suffered memory loss, and wandered India for the next 10 years. While returning from [[Chittagong]] to Dhaka in 1920, he recovered his memory, and was instructed by his [[guru]] to return home.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOver the following days, his sisters became convinced that this sanyasi was indeed the second kumar, but he returned to Dhaka by 25 April. Relatives invited him back to [[Joydebpur]] on 30 April when various relatives and tenants came to see him.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news|last1=Sen|first1=Ronojoy|title=Scholar delves into Bhawal mystery|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Scholar-delves-into-Bhawal-mystery/articleshow/5106564.cms|accessdate=23 January 2017|agency=[[Times of India]]|publisher=[[Times of India]]|date=30 March 2002}}</ref> When the crowd questioned him, he remembered the name of his [[wet nurse]], a fact that was not public,  and so they recognised him as the second kumar of Bhawal.\n\n== Popular acceptance ==\nThere was considerable rural acceptance that the man was the Second Kumar of Bhawal. Many of his former tenants and relatives began to support him. On 15 May a large crowd gathered before the Jaidebpur Rajbari in Dhaka and announced in public that they believed that he was the returned Kumar. But the Kumar's widow Bibhabati refused to meet the claimant and regarded him as an impostor.\n\nOn 29 May 1921 the claimant arrived in Dhaka in the Bhawal house with two lawyers to meet the district magistrate and collector J. H. Lindsay who recorded his claim.\n\nThe British colonial government and the Court of Wards were not enthusiastic. Managers of the Bhawal estate sent investigators to make inquiries about the identity of the claimant and find witnesses to support their side of the story. Two investigators went to Punjab to meet Dharamdas Naga, who identified the claimant as his pupil Mal Singh of Aujla, also known as Sundardas. On 3 June the [[Bengal Board of Revenue|Board of Revenue]] announced in public that they had proof that the kumar's body had been cremated in Darjeeling and therefore the claimant was an impostor.\n\nDespite this, the public and many tenants of the Bhawal estate continued to support the claimant. Many tenants paid their rents to the claimant, who used them to hire lawyers. Solicitor [[Ananda Chandra Nandi]] agreed to represent him in court. Claimant's principal supporter was Suren Mukherjee.\n\nBoth opponents and supporters of the claimant published their own articles and pamphlets propagating their cause. Some of them included alleged eyewitness reports of how a group of sannyasis had rescued the still-alive kumar from the funeral pyre, taken him away and healed him. Others compared the case with that of a historical impostor Pratapchand and even the [[Tichborne claimant|Tichborne case]]. Some writers wrote plays or stories to make their point about the case, some of them accusing Bibhabati and his brother of incestuous relations or conspiracy to poison the kumar.\n\nThe Board of Revenue claimed that the whole matter was a conspiracy organised by interested parties who wanted to use the estate for their own purposes. When they had found a suitable candidate, they had prepared him for the part of a returned kumar with the aid of kumar's sisters. Many Indian witnesses also stated that the claimant could not speak Bengali well and he was mainly ignorant about the events of the kumar's youth. One of them, [[Mukunda Guin]], was stabbed to death in September 1921.\n\nAfter the claimant moved to Calcutta in 1924, he also received recognition in local social circles. He joined the [[Bengal Landholders Association]] and became a director of [[Bengal Flotilla Service]]. He tried to use various official channels to argue his case until 1929, when he moved back to Dhaka and began to collect tenant's rents and tribute against his share of the 1/3 of the property.\n\n==  Criminal case: ''Srimati Bibhabati Devi  v/s Kumar Ramendra Narayan Roy and others (1936\u2013 42)''  ==\n\n=== First trial ===\nOn 24 April 1930, lawyers working for the claimant, supported by the sisters and elder sister-in-law of the kumar, filed a declaratory suit in Dhaka claiming the name and property of Ramendra Narayan Ray against Bibhabati Devi and other landholders who were represented by the [[Court of Wards (India)|Court of Wards]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Judgement was delivered in favour of the plaintiff in 1936. District judge Alan Henderson assigned judge [[Pannalal Bose]] to the case. Bejoy Chandra Chatterjee served as counsel for the claimant, now a [[plaintiff]]. Amiya Nath Chaudhuri counselled the defendants, those represented by the Court of wards. The trial began on 30 November 1933.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn court the sannaysi declared that he fell victim to a conspiracy hatched by his brother-in-law Satyendranath Banerjee, an unemployed graduate, who wanted to control his share of the estate through his childless sister. He further alleged that Satyendranath had bribed the family physician Ashutosh Dasgupta to state that the rajkumar was suffering from syphilis, and was persuaded by the conspirators to go for treatment to Darjeeling, where they all lodged at a house called \"Step Aside,\" close to the funeral ground.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLawyers working for the Court of Wards tried to prove that this barely literate man could not be of [[Brahmin|Brahmin caste]], but those on the claimant's side were able to prove that the kumar had actually been barely able to read and write (today, it is possible that such a condition would have been described as dyslexic). Defense also claimed that the allegation that Kumar had had a mistress named Elokeshi was total fiction. When Elokeshi was summoned, she said that police had offered her money for not testifying.\n\nDefense also argued that kumar's syphilis had advanced to the state of open sores when there were no sign of any syphilitic scars in the claimant's body. The claimant spoke mainly Urdu, claiming that he had forgotten most of his Bengali during his travels. There was also an argument about the exact colour of kumar's eyes. There were also claims that the body burned in the funeral pyre had been a substitute.\n\nBoth sides summoned hundreds of [[witness]]es and some of their statements were contradictory. Defense questioned kumar's sister Jyotirmayi Debi, who supported the claimant and stated that the claimant had various family characteristics and that the claimant did speak Bengali. The plaintiff's side, in turn, closely questioned Bibhabati Devi, who denied she saw any resemblance between her dead husband and the claimant. Ananda Kumari, widow of one of the other kumars, claimed that the kumar had been able to speak English and write in Bengali, neither of which the claimant could do. However, the letters that were presented as evidence of this were found to be forgeries.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn September 1935, the guru Dharamdas Naga arrived to testify in court through an interpreter and repeated that he recognised the claimant as his former disciple Sundardas, previously Mal Singh, who was a [[Punjab region|Punjab]]i [[Sikh]] from [[Lahore]]. The claimant's supporters insisted that this guru was a fraud.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chatterjee |first=Partha |author-link=Partha Chatterjee (scholar) |year=2002 |title=A Princely Impostor? : The Strange and Universal History of the Kumar of Bhawal |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/princelyimpostor00chat_1/page/227 227\u2013228] |isbn=978-0-691-09031-3 |quote=The third week of September 1935 ...

Afterwards he retired from the [[judiciary]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Appeal ===\nThe claimant moved to take up residence at the estate but the Board of Revenue did not release any funds to him. On 5 October 1936 the government filed an appeal against the judgment in the Calcutta High Court, again in the name of the wards of the Court of Wards. Chief justice of the High Court gave an order that all the evidence in the previous trial must be printed for the use of the appellate court. It amounted to 11,327 printed pages.\n\nThree judges, [[Leonard Costello|Sir Leonard Costello]], Charu Chandra Biswas and Ronald Francis Lodge formed a special bench for the case. Both sides retained their former lawyers. The hearing began on 14 November 1938.\n\nAppellants' side concentrated on what had really happened in Darjeeling, arguing that there should be proof that kumar was not dead and proof of who, if anybody, had been cremated. Respondents' side defended the judgment, stating the kumar's identity had been proved. Hearings concluded on 14 August 1939.\n\nJudge Costello left for a holiday in Britain, intending to return in November to finish the case. In the meantime, [[World War II]] erupted in Europe and he was unable to return due to [[war|state of war]]. On 20 August 1940, other judges decided that the judgment could not wait any longer and began to announce their judgment. Other judges had presented their view to Costello in writing, he had delivered his own judgment in writing from Britain and it remained sealed until it was read in court.\n\nJudge Biswas defended judge Basu's conclusions in his long verdict and stated that the defendants had failed to prove that the Second Kumar had died. He charged that the defendants had tutored witnesses and produced fraudulent letters. He therefore found the favour of the claimant. Justice Lodge disbelieved the story of the rescue, criticised the amount of witnesses both sides had summoned, dismissed many details of the plaintiff's evidence and accused the plaintiff's side of pressuring and insulting the witnesses for the defence. He therefore found in favour of the defendants.\n\nWhen judge Biswas read the judgment of Justice Costello's on 29 August 1940, it broke the tie. Costello criticised the Court of Wards for pressuring witnesses with irrelevant questions and withholding documents. He did not find sufficient reason to overturn the decision of the lower court. On 25 November, after two months of deliberation, the court announced that Costello's view was valid and therefore the appeal was dismissed.\n\n=== Privy Council ===\nThe claimant was allowed to withdraw money from his share of the estate. He still left this share in the care of the Court of Wards until further developments. He also got married.\n\nThe Board of Revenue did not answer right away and A.N. Chaudhuri withdrew from the case but Bibhabati Devi was not ready to give up. Developments of the war delayed further appeals until 1943, when lawyers for Bibhabati Devi filed for a leave to appeal against the judgment of the High Court in the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in London.<ref name=\":1\" /> Partially because of the bomb damage to the council chamber in the blitz, The Council moved to the House of Lords and the next hearing began there in 1945. D.N. Pritt worked for the claimant's side and king's counsel W.W. K.

The top photo is of Ramendranarayan Roy Claimantand the bottom photo is of the Claimant as sanyasi. ]]\n'''Ramendra Narayan Roy''' was one of the [[kumar]]s (\"prince\") of the [[Bhawal Estate]], a large [[zamindari]] in [[Bengal]] in modern-day [[Bangladesh]]. He was one of three brothers who had inherited the estate from their father. He was popularly known to people as \"mejokumar\". The Bhawal Estate spread over {{convert|579|sqmi|km2}} and included villages with a population of around 500,000, many of them tenant farmers.The second son Ramendranarayan Roy (b.28 July 1884) was yet to take up the zamindari management when the famous incident of the Bhawal Case took place.\n\nRamendra Narayan Roy, second kumar of Bhawal, spent most of his time hunting, in festivities, and with women, having several mistresses. By 1905 he was said to have contracted [[syphilis]]. In 1909 he went to [[Darjeeling]] to seek treatment, accompanied by his wife Bibhabati Devi, her brother Satyendranath Banerjee, and a large retinue, but was reported to have died there on 7 May at the age of 25.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bhawal_Case|title=Bhawal Case|last=Islam|first=Sirajul|date=|website=[[Banglapedia]]|publisher=Bangladesh Asiatic Society|access-date=}}</ref> The reported cause of death was biliary colic ([[gallstones]]).

Some witnesses testified that a sudden hailstorm had interrupted the cremation just before the pyre should have been lighted and the body might have disappeared when the mourners had sought shelter.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nHis young wife Bibhabati Devi moved to [[Dhaka]] to live with her brother Satyen Banerjee. Over the next ten years the other Bhawal Estate kumars also died and the colonial British [[Court of Wards (India)|Court of Wards]] took control of the estate on behalf of their widows.\n\n[ Regarding the family name, long before the beginning of British Raj in Bharotborsho (India) 'Baro Bhuiya' (\u09e7\u09e8) (\u09ac\u09be\u09b0\u09cb \u09ad\u09c1\u0981\u0987\u09af\u09bc\u09be) or (12 great land lords) ruled over the lands of what was then known as Bangladesh (including current day West Bengal, Bangla Desh, Assam, Tripura, parts of modern-day Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha). The Bhawals were descended from one of the Baro Bhuiyan families. There was a custom among the Zamindari families of those days of acquiring high sounding titles like Roy etc., and Ramendra Narayan Roy's surname of Roy was in fact a title. His original surname was Bhawal.]\n\n== Rumors and return ==\nIn 1920, a sanyasi appeared in [[Buckland Bund]] in Dhaka covered in ashes.<ref name=\":0\" /> He sat on the street for four months and attracted attention because he was of unusually good physical stature. There were rumours that the second kumar had returned, even when the man said that he had renounced his family. Buddhu, the son of an elder sister of the brothers, visited him but was not convinced. Some of the locals arranged for the man's visit to [[Joydebpur railway station|Joydebpur]] where he arrived on 12 April 1921 on an elephant. Under public pressure, the [[Sanyasa|sanyasi]] finally disclosed that he was Ramendranarayan Roy, the raja of Bhawal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe sanyasi claimed that while in Darjeeling he was poisoned and a cremation was attempted. But the people hired to cremate the raja left his body unattended and not cremated because a strong hailstorm had started raging at that time.<ref name=\":0\" /> A group of [[Sanyasa|naga sanyasis]] found him lying unconscious, took him to their abode and nursed him back to recovery. He recovered, but had suffered memory loss, and wandered India for the next 10 years. While returning from [[Chittagong]] to Dhaka in 1920, he recovered his memory, and was instructed by his [[guru]] to return home.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOver the following days, his sisters became convinced that this sanyasi was indeed the second kumar, but he returned to Dhaka by 25 April. Relatives invited him back to [[Joydebpur]] on 30 April when various relatives and tenants came to see him.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news|last1=Sen|first1=Ronojoy|title=Scholar delves into Bhawal mystery|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Scholar-delves-into-Bhawal-mystery/articleshow/5106564.cms|accessdate=23 January 2017|agency=[[Times of India]]|publisher=[[Times of India]]|date=30 March 2002}}</ref> When the crowd questioned him, he remembered the name of his [[wet nurse]], a fact that was not public,  and so they recognised him as the second kumar of Bhawal.\n\n== Popular acceptance ==\nThere was considerable rural acceptance that the man was the Second Kumar of Bhawal. Many of his former tenants and relatives began to support him. On 15 May a large crowd gathered before the Jaidebpur Rajbari in Dhaka and announced in public that they believed that he was the returned Kumar. But the Kumar's widow Bibhabati refused to meet the claimant and regarded him as an impostor.\n\nOn 29 May 1921 the claimant arrived in Dhaka in the Bhawal house with two lawyers to meet the district magistrate and collector J. H. Lindsay who recorded his claim.\n\nThe British colonial government and the Court of Wards were not enthusiastic. Managers of the Bhawal estate sent investigators to make inquiries about the identity of the claimant and find witnesses to support their side of the story. Two investigators went to Punjab to meet Dharamdas Naga, who identified the claimant as his pupil Mal Singh of Aujla, also known as Sundardas. On 3 June the [[Bengal Board of Revenue|Board of Revenue]] announced in public that they had proof that the kumar's body had been cremated in Darjeeling and therefore the claimant was an impostor.\n\nDespite this, the public and many tenants of the Bhawal estate continued to support the claimant. Many tenants paid their rents to the claimant, who used them to hire lawyers. Solicitor [[Ananda Chandra Nandi]] agreed to represent him in court. Claimant's principal supporter was Suren Mukherjee.\n\nBoth opponents and supporters of the claimant published their own articles and pamphlets propagating their cause. Some of them included alleged eyewitness reports of how a group of sannyasis had rescued the still-alive kumar from the funeral pyre, taken him away and healed him. Others compared the case with that of a historical impostor Pratapchand and even the [[Tichborne claimant|Tichborne case]]. Some writers wrote plays or stories to make their point about the case, some of them accusing Bibhabati and his brother of incestuous relations or conspiracy to poison the kumar.\n\nThe Board of Revenue claimed that the whole matter was a conspiracy organised by interested parties who wanted to use the estate for their own purposes. When they had found a suitable candidate, they had prepared him for the part of a returned kumar with the aid of kumar's sisters. Many Indian witnesses also stated that the claimant could not speak Bengali well and he was mainly ignorant about the events of the kumar's youth. One of them, [[Mukunda Guin]], was stabbed to death in September 1921.\n\nAfter the claimant moved to Calcutta in 1924, he also received recognition in local social circles. He joined the [[Bengal Landholders Association]] and became a director of [[Bengal Flotilla Service]]. He tried to use various official channels to argue his case until 1929, when he moved back to Dhaka and began to collect tenant's rents and tribute against his share of the 1/3 of the property.\n\n==  Criminal case: ''Srimati Bibhabati Devi  v/s Kumar Ramendra Narayan Roy and others (1936\u2013 42)''  ==\n\n=== First trial ===\nOn 24 April 1930, lawyers working for the claimant, supported by the sisters and elder sister-in-law of the kumar, filed a declaratory suit in Dhaka claiming the name and property of Ramendra Narayan Ray against Bibhabati Devi and other landholders who were represented by the [[Court of Wards (India)|Court of Wards]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Judgement was delivered in favour of the plaintiff in 1936. District judge Alan Henderson assigned judge [[Pannalal Bose]] to the case. Bejoy Chandra Chatterjee served as counsel for the claimant, now a [[plaintiff]]. Amiya Nath Chaudhuri counselled the defendants, those represented by the Court of wards. The trial began on 30 November 1933.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn court the sannaysi declared that he fell victim to a conspiracy hatched by his brother-in-law Satyendranath Banerjee, an unemployed graduate, who wanted to control his share of the estate through his childless sister. He further alleged that Satyendranath had bribed the family physician Ashutosh Dasgupta to state that the rajkumar was suffering from syphilis, and was persuaded by the conspirators to go for treatment to Darjeeling, where they all lodged at a house called \"Step Aside,\" close to the funeral ground.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLawyers working for the Court of Wards tried to prove that this barely literate man could not be of [[Brahmin|Brahmin caste]], but those on the claimant's side were able to prove that the kumar had actually been barely able to read and write (today, it is possible that such a condition would have been described as dyslexic). Defense also claimed that the allegation that Kumar had had a mistress named Elokeshi was total fiction. When Elokeshi was summoned, she said that police had offered her money for not testifying.\n\nDefense also argued that kumar's syphilis had advanced to the state of open sores when there were no sign of any syphilitic scars in the claimant's body. The claimant spoke mainly Urdu, claiming that he had forgotten most of his Bengali during his travels. There was also an argument about the exact colour of kumar's eyes. There were also claims that the body burned in the funeral pyre had been a substitute.\n\nBoth sides summoned hundreds of [[witness]]es and some of their statements were contradictory. Defense questioned kumar's sister Jyotirmayi Debi, who supported the claimant and stated that the claimant had various family characteristics and that the claimant did speak Bengali. The plaintiff's side, in turn, closely questioned Bibhabati Devi, who denied she saw any resemblance between her dead husband and the claimant. Ananda Kumari, widow of one of the other kumars, claimed that the kumar had been able to speak English and write in Bengali, neither of which the claimant could do. However, the letters that were presented as evidence of this were found to be forgeries.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn September 1935, the guru Dharamdas Naga arrived to testify in court through an interpreter and repeated that he recognised the claimant as his former disciple Sundardas, previously Mal Singh, who was a [[Punjab region|Punjab]]i [[Sikh]] from [[Lahore]]. The claimant's supporters insisted that this guru was a fraud.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chatterjee |first=Partha |author-link=Partha Chatterjee (scholar) |year=2002 |title=A Princely Impostor? : The Strange and Universal History of the Kumar of Bhawal |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/princelyimpostor00chat_1/page/227 227\u2013228] |isbn=978-0-691-09031-3 |quote=The third week of September 1935 ...

Afterwards he retired from the [[judiciary]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Appeal ===\nThe claimant moved to take up residence at the estate but the Board of Revenue did not release any funds to him. On 5 October 1936 the government filed an appeal against the judgment in the Calcutta High Court, again in the name of the wards of the Court of Wards. Chief justice of the High Court gave an order that all the evidence in the previous trial must be printed for the use of the appellate court. It amounted to 11,327 printed pages.\n\nThree judges, [[Leonard Costello|Sir Leonard Costello]], Charu Chandra Biswas and Ronald Francis Lodge formed a special bench for the case. Both sides retained their former lawyers. The hearing began on 14 November 1938.\n\nAppellants' side concentrated on what had really happened in Darjeeling, arguing that there should be proof that kumar was not dead and proof of who, if anybody, had been cremated. Respondents' side defended the judgment, stating the kumar's identity had been proved. Hearings concluded on 14 August 1939.\n\nJudge Costello left for a holiday in Britain, intending to return in November to finish the case. In the meantime, [[World War II]] erupted in Europe and he was unable to return due to [[war|state of war]]. On 20 August 1940, other judges decided that the judgment could not wait any longer and began to announce their judgment. Other judges had presented their view to Costello in writing, he had delivered his own judgment in writing from Britain and it remained sealed until it was read in court.\n\nJudge Biswas defended judge Basu's conclusions in his long verdict and stated that the defendants had failed to prove that the Second Kumar had died. He charged that the defendants had tutored witnesses and produced fraudulent letters. He therefore found the favour of the claimant. Justice Lodge disbelieved the story of the rescue, criticised the amount of witnesses both sides had summoned, dismissed many details of the plaintiff's evidence and accused the plaintiff's side of pressuring and insulting the witnesses for the defence. He therefore found in favour of the defendants.\n\nWhen judge Biswas read the judgment of Justice Costello's on 29 August 1940, it broke the tie. Costello criticised the Court of Wards for pressuring witnesses with irrelevant questions and withholding documents. He did not find sufficient reason to overturn the decision of the lower court. On 25 November, after two months of deliberation, the court announced that Costello's view was valid and therefore the appeal was dismissed.\n\n=== Privy Council ===\nThe claimant was allowed to withdraw money from his share of the estate. He still left this share in the care of the Court of Wards until further developments. He also got married.\n\nThe Board of Revenue did not answer right away and A.N. Chaudhuri withdrew from the case but Bibhabati Devi was not ready to give up. Developments of the war delayed further appeals until 1943, when lawyers for Bibhabati Devi filed for a leave to appeal against the judgment of the High Court in the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in London.<ref name=\":1\" /> Partially because of the bomb damage to the council chamber in the blitz, The Council moved to the House of Lords and the next hearing began there in 1945. D.N. Pritt worked for the claimant's side and king's counsel W.W. K.

As a single major rulebook \u2013 but one that required another World of Darkness rulebook to play \u2013 Kindred of the East could attract some of the same attention as a new core RPG but without the need to support a new line. This offered White Wolf an alternative to the yearly churn of new game lines \u2013 though a few new lines would still appear in the following years.\"<ref name=\"designers\">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|page=224}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nCharacters in Kindred of the East (or '''Kuei-jin''', as they call themselves) are [[vampire]]s as depicted in classical [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]], and [[India]]n [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Taoist]], [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhist]] [[mythology]]. Unlike the vampires traditionally associated with [[Dracula]] or Caine, Kuei-jin were once mortals who died with the burden of unfulfilled [[Dharma]] or duties. Tortured in [[Yomi]] for their inadequacies in life, their [[soul]]s successfully escaped and returned to their bodies. Now half-alive and half-dead, Kuei-jin must live by stealing [[Qi|chi]] from mortal victims to sustain themselves while trying to fulfill their Dharma. The most convenient form of chi that can be stolen is in blood, leading to their vampiric tendencies, but they cannot create new vampires. Practically all Kindred distrust the Kuei-jin. The Kuei-jin are also known to war with the other sects for territory.\n\n==Themes==\nKuei-jin are beings torn by inner conflict, and the themes of the game relate to this heavily.  Unlike Western vampires, Kuei-jin are [[ghost|revenant]]s and thus spiritual beings in nature.\n\n===Yin vs. Yang===\nThe classic opposition of [[Yin Yang|yin and yang]] are important to Kuei-jin not only for philosophical reasons, but because this dichotomy also delineates the two forms of chi they can potentially ingest. An imbalance of yin or yang chi in their system can lead to dire consequences.  Yin-imbalanced Kuei-jin become corpselike [[zombie]]s suffering from a lack of [[emotion]]. At its worst, yin-imbalance reduces a kuei-jin to a [[hopping corpse]]. Yang-imbalanced Kuei-jin suffer wild mood swings and impulsive lusts for food, sex, and other forms of stimulation. Possibly the strangest consequence of yang-imbalance is the ability to have or sire children. Such children are called [[Dhampir (World of Darkness)|dhampyr]]s, and are mortal half-vampires.\n\n===Hun vs. P'o===\nA Kuei-jin's stint in the hells of [[Yomi]] divides the mind into two [[Hun and po]] parts: The '''Hun''', or high mind, that is the seat of rational thought, and the '''P'o''', or demon mind, that exists to satisfy its own base urges (usually at the expense of the Hun). As former [[Wraith: The Oblivion|wraiths]], a Kuei-jin has a splinter of the forces of Oblivion in its soul. While many Kuei-jin see their P'o as a curse, it is important to note that without the P'o, they would never have escaped hell in the first place. Furthermore, Kuei-jin who stifle and contain their P'o utterly become cold, calculating individuals who lack any ideological spark; such stagnancy can be devastating when the weight of karma (spiritual consequences of actions) is on one's shoulders.\n\n===Mortal vs. Spirit===\nThe Kuei-jin stand between the mortal world (which they can never fully return to) and the spirit world (which they cannot fully embrace). Many Kuei-jin struggle to find a balance between these two worlds that suits the precise nature of their Dharma.\n\n==Dharmas==\nA Kuei-jin's existence is a quest for enlightenment. In their search for karmic resolution, different Kuei-jin follow different paths to ease their karmic discomfort. The '''Dharmas''', five philosophies accepted by the greater Kuei-jin community as potential paths, each emphasize a particular aspect of Kuei-jin existence:\n\n* '''The Howl of the Devil Tiger''': The Dharma embracing the P'o; these Kuei-Jin seek to metamorphose into demons (rather than to serve demons, as the hated Akuma do).\n* '''The Way of the Resplendent Crane''': The Dharma embracing the Hun; they seek to uphold the highest principles (in theory; they are nonetheless still monsters).\n* '''The Song of the Shadow''': The Dharma embracing Yin. Embrace their dead and passionless nature through the pursuit of knowledge and sorcerous power, seeking mastery over the forces of death.\n* '''The Path of a Thousand Whispers''': The Dharma embracing balance. Known also as \"Rootless Trees\", they adopt a series of different mortal identities in order to learn from a variety of experiences, while their true self remains detached and \"Zen\" about these lessons.\n* '''The Dance of the Thrashing Dragon''': The Dharma embracing Yang. Seek to defy their undead state through frenzied revelry and acts meant to celebrate life (in all its bloodcurdling savagery).\n\nIn addition to these primary dharmas, a number of '''Heretical Dharmas''' have also come into existence. Not accepted in Kuei-jin society, these paths nevertheless find some followers:\n\n* '''The Face of the Gods''': A Dharma embracing both Hun and P'o. As the name suggests, they intend to become literal gods on Earth, or at least claim the role and be worshipped.\n* '''The Flame of the Rising Phoenix''': A Dharma embracing both Hun and Yang, whose members seek to reclaim their original lives rather than to accept their new status as monsters.\n* '''The Spirit of the Living Earth''': A Dharma embracing both Yin and Yang. A shamanic path devoted to the Old Ways.\n* '''The Tempest of Inner Focus''': A Dharma embracing balance, in a more straightforward and moderate manner than the Thousand Whispers. Influenced by Taoism.\n* '''The Scorpion Eaters''': A Dharma embracing the P'o, who can consume only Tainted Chi and yet are not Akuma. \n\nFinally, some Kuei-jin turn their backs on enlightenment entirely, instead swearing fealty to the '''Yama Kings''' (the rulers of Yomi) to metamorphose into Akuma, the demon people. Bartering their souls, Akuma enter [[Faust]]ian deals with the Yama Kings and pursue only power.\n\n==The Middle Kingdom==\nKuei-jin are the most visible '''shen''' (supernatural creatures) of the '''Middle Kingdom''' (modern [[Asia]]), but are not alone. Unlike [[Vampire: The Masquerade|Western Kindred]], they have close ties with the spirit world. They must also compete with the '''hengeyokai''' ([[Changing Breed|Shapeshifters]] of the East, as it were), [[Mage: The Ascension|mages]], and [[Preta|gaki]].\n\nThere are several offshoots of the Kuei-Jin who share a measure of their condition but are different in certain particulars.\n\u00a7 '''Dhampyrs''' are the half-dead mortal children sired (or, more unusually, borne) by Kuei-Jin in the throes of Yang imbalance, which enables them to breed as if living. Capable of controlling Chi and manifesting Disciplines, the dhampyrs have many of the vampires' strengths and few of their weaknesses, both to a milder extent.\n\u00a7 '''Yulan-Jin''' are a subset of Kuei-Jin whose souls are not able to reform their original bodies after escaping from Hell; instead, they possess the bodies of the recently dead, and when \"killed\", they must find a new corpse to inhabit, forcing them to switch identities. Are generally scorned by the Kuei-Jin for their perceived spiritual weakness.\n\n==Books==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Title !! Product No. !!ISBN !!

As a single major rulebook \u2013 but one that required another World of Darkness rulebook to play \u2013 Kindred of the East could attract some of the same attention as a new core RPG but without the need to support a new line. This offered White Wolf an alternative to the yearly churn of new game lines \u2013 though a few new lines would still appear in the following years.\"<ref name=\"designers\">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|page=224}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nCharacters in Kindred of the East (or '''Kuei-jin''', as they call themselves) are [[vampire]]s as depicted in classical [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]], and [[India]]n [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Taoist]], [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhist]] [[mythology]]. Unlike the vampires traditionally associated with [[Dracula]] or Caine, Kuei-jin were once mortals who died with the burden of unfulfilled [[Dharma]] or duties. Tortured in [[Yomi]] for their inadequacies in life, their [[soul]]s successfully escaped and returned to their bodies. Now half-alive and half-dead, Kuei-jin must live by stealing [[Qi|chi]] from mortal victims to sustain themselves while trying to fulfill their Dharma. The most convenient form of chi that can be stolen is in blood, leading to their vampiric tendencies, but they cannot create new vampires. Practically all Kindred distrust the Kuei-jin. The Kuei-jin are also known to war with the other sects for territory.\n\n==Themes==\nKuei-jin are beings torn by inner conflict, and the themes of the game relate to this heavily.  Unlike Western vampires, Kuei-jin are [[ghost|revenant]]s and thus spiritual beings in nature.\n\n===Yin vs. Yang===\nThe classic opposition of [[Yin Yang|yin and yang]] are important to Kuei-jin not only for philosophical reasons, but because this dichotomy also delineates the two forms of chi they can potentially ingest. An imbalance of yin or yang chi in their system can lead to dire consequences.  Yin-imbalanced Kuei-jin become corpselike [[zombie]]s suffering from a lack of [[emotion]]. At its worst, yin-imbalance reduces a kuei-jin to a [[hopping corpse]]. Yang-imbalanced Kuei-jin suffer wild mood swings and impulsive lusts for food, sex, and other forms of stimulation. Possibly the strangest consequence of yang-imbalance is the ability to have or sire children. Such children are called [[Dhampir (World of Darkness)|dhampyr]]s, and are mortal half-vampires.\n\n===Hun vs. P'o===\nA Kuei-jin's stint in the hells of [[Yomi]] divides the mind into two [[Hun and po]] parts: The '''Hun''', or high mind, that is the seat of rational thought, and the '''P'o''', or demon mind, that exists to satisfy its own base urges (usually at the expense of the Hun). As former [[Wraith: The Oblivion|wraiths]], a Kuei-jin has a splinter of the forces of Oblivion in its soul. While many Kuei-jin see their P'o as a curse, it is important to note that without the P'o, they would never have escaped hell in the first place. Furthermore, Kuei-jin who stifle and contain their P'o utterly become cold, calculating individuals who lack any ideological spark; such stagnancy can be devastating when the weight of karma (spiritual consequences of actions) is on one's shoulders.\n\n===Mortal vs. Spirit===\nThe Kuei-jin stand between the mortal world (which they can never fully return to) and the spirit world (which they cannot fully embrace). Many Kuei-jin struggle to find a balance between these two worlds that suits the precise nature of their Dharma.\n\n==Dharmas==\nA Kuei-jin's existence is a quest for enlightenment. In their search for karmic resolution, different Kuei-jin follow different paths to ease their karmic discomfort. The '''Dharmas''', five philosophies accepted by the greater Kuei-jin community as potential paths, each emphasize a particular aspect of Kuei-jin existence:\n\n* '''The Howl of the Devil Tiger''': The Dharma embracing the P'o; these Kuei-Jin seek to metamorphose into demons (rather than to serve demons, as the hated Akuma do).\n* '''The Way of the Resplendent Crane''': The Dharma embracing the Hun; they seek to uphold the highest principles (in theory; they are nonetheless still monsters).\n* '''The Song of the Shadow''': The Dharma embracing Yin. Embrace their dead and passionless nature through the pursuit of knowledge and sorcerous power, seeking mastery over the forces of death.\n* '''The Path of a Thousand Whispers''': The Dharma embracing balance. Known also as \"Rootless Trees\", they adopt a series of different mortal identities in order to learn from a variety of experiences, while their true self remains detached and \"Zen\" about these lessons.\n* '''The Dance of the Thrashing Dragon''': The Dharma embracing Yang. Seek to defy their undead state through frenzied revelry and acts meant to celebrate life (in all its bloodcurdling savagery).\n\nIn addition to these primary dharmas, a number of '''Heretical Dharmas''' have also come into existence. Not accepted in Kuei-jin society, these paths nevertheless find some followers:\n\n* '''The Face of the Gods''': A Dharma embracing both Hun and P'o. As the name suggests, they intend to become literal gods on Earth, or at least claim the role and be worshipped.\n* '''The Flame of the Rising Phoenix''': A Dharma embracing both Hun and Yang, whose members seek to reclaim their original lives rather than to accept their new status as monsters.\n* '''The Spirit of the Living Earth''': A Dharma embracing both Yin and Yang. A shamanic path devoted to the Old Ways.\n* '''The Tempest of Inner Focus''': A Dharma embracing balance, in a more straightforward and moderate manner than the Thousand Whispers. Influenced by Taoism.\n* '''The Scorpion Eaters''': A Dharma embracing the P'o, who can consume only Tainted Chi and yet are not Akuma. \n\nFinally, some Kuei-jin turn their backs on enlightenment entirely, instead swearing fealty to the '''Yama Kings''' (the rulers of Yomi) to metamorphose into Akuma, the demon people. Bartering their souls, Akuma enter [[Faust]]ian deals with the Yama Kings and pursue only power.\n\n==The Middle Kingdom==\nKuei-jin are the most visible '''shen''' (supernatural creatures) of the '''Middle Kingdom''' (modern [[Asia]]), but are not alone. Unlike [[Vampire: The Masquerade|Western Kindred]], they have close ties with the spirit world. They must also compete with the '''hengeyokai''' ([[Changing Breed|Shapeshifters]] of the East, as it were), [[Mage: The Ascension|mages]], and [[Preta|gaki]].\n\nThere are several offshoots of the Kuei-Jin who share a measure of their condition but are different in certain particulars.\n\u00a7 '''Dhampyrs''' are the half-dead mortal children sired (or, more unusually, borne) by Kuei-Jin in the throes of Yang imbalance, which enables them to breed as if living. Capable of controlling Chi and manifesting Disciplines, the dhampyrs have many of the vampires' strengths and few of their weaknesses, both to a milder extent.\n\u00a7 '''Yulan-Jin''' are a subset of Kuei-Jin whose souls are not able to reform their original bodies after escaping from Hell; instead, they possess the bodies of the recently dead, and when \"killed\", they must find a new corpse to inhabit, forcing them to switch identities. Are generally scorned by the Kuei-Jin for their perceived spiritual weakness.\n\n==Books==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Title !! Product No. !!ISBN !!
