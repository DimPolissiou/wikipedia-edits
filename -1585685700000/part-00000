In the context of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] low plasma sodium (hyponatremia), the brain compensates by decreasing the levels of these osmolytes within the cells, so that they can remain relatively isotonic with their surroundings and not absorb too much fluid. The reverse is true in hypernatremia, in which the cells increase their intracellular osmolytes so as not to lose too much fluid to the extracellular space.\n\nWith correction of the hyponatremia with [[intravenous fluids]], the extracellular tonicity increases, followed by an increase in intracellular tonicity. When the correction is too rapid, not enough time is allowed for the brain's cells to adjust to the new tonicity, namely by increasing the intracellular osmoles mentioned earlier.

In the context of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] low plasma sodium (hyponatremia), the brain compensates by decreasing the levels of these osmolytes within the cells, so that they can remain relatively isotonic with their surroundings and not absorb too much fluid. The reverse is true in hypernatremia, in which the cells increase their intracellular osmolytes so as not to lose too much fluid to the extracellular space.\n\nWith correction of the hyponatremia with [[intravenous fluids]], the extracellular tonicity increases, followed by an increase in intracellular tonicity. When the correction is too rapid, not enough time is allowed for the brain's cells to adjust to the new tonicity, namely by increasing the intracellular osmoles mentioned earlier. If the serum sodium levels rise too rapidly, the increased extracellular tonicity will continue to drive water out of the brain's cells. This can lead to cellular dysfunction and CPM.<ref name=\"pmid12566274\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Medana IM, Esiri MM |title=Axonal damage: a key predictor of outcome in human CNS diseases|journal=Brain|volume=126|issue=Pt 3|pages=515\u201330|date=March 2003|pmid=12566274|doi=10.1093/brain/awg061|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12566274}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid24569125\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Spasovski G, Vanholder R, Allolio B, Annane D, Ball S, Bichet D, Decaux G, Fenske W, Hoorn E, Ichai C, Joannidis M, Soupart A, Zietse R, Haller M, van der Veer S, Van Biesen W, Nagler E |title=Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia|journal=European Journal of Endocrinology|volume=170|issue=3|pages=G1\u2013G47|date=2014|doi=10.1530/eje-13-1020|pmid=24569125}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nIt can be diagnosed clinically in the appropriate context, but may be difficult to confirm radiologically using conventional imaging techniques.  Changes are more prominent on MRI than on CT, but often take days or weeks after acute symptom onset to develop. Imaging by [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] typically demonstrates areas of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images.\n\n==Treatment==\nTo minimise the risk of this condition developing from its most common cause, overly rapid reversal of hyponatremia, the hyponatremia should be corrected at a rate not exceeding 10&nbsp;mmol/L/24&nbsp;h or 0.5&nbsp;mEq/L/h; or 18 mEq/L/48hrs; thus avoiding demyelination.<ref name=\"pmid24569125\" /> No large clinical trials have been performed to examine the efficacy of therapeutic re-lowering of serum sodium, or other interventions sometimes advocated such as steroids or plasma exchange.<ref name=\"pmid24569125\" /> \nAlcoholic patients should receive vitamin supplementation and a formal evaluation of their nutritional status.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7466381 | volume=211 | issue=4486 | title=Rapid correction of hyponatremia causes demyelination: relation to central pontine myelinolysis |date=March 1981 |vauthors=Kleinschmidt-DeMasters BK, Norenberg MD | journal=Science | pages=1068\u201370 | doi=10.1126/science.7466381| bibcode=1981Sci...211.1068K }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7348981 | volume=105 | title=Experimental pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis | year=1980 | author=Laureno R | journal=Trans Am Neurol Assoc | pages=354\u20138}}</ref>\n\nOnce osmotic demyelination has begun, there is no cure or specific treatment.

As part of the compromise, the legislation prohibited slavery north of the [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 parallel]], excluding Missouri. The [[16th United States Congress]] passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President [[James Monroe]] signed it on March 6, 1820.<ref>Dangerfield, 1966. p. 125<br />Wilentz, 2004. p. 382</ref>\n\nEarlier, on February 1819, Representative [[James Tallmadge Jr.]], a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republican]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood, which included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery, believing that slavery was a state issue settled by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths rule]], which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a states' slave population. Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality\";<ref>Wilentz 2004. p. 387</ref> and \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\".<ref>Wilentz 2004 p. 389</ref>\n\nWhen free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator [[Jesse B. Thomas]] of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36\u00b0 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by those Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]], in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half the anti-restrictionist House Southerners to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso, while maneuvering a number of restrictionist House northerners to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 25: \"[Henry Clay], who managed to bring up the separate parts of the compromise separately in the House, enabling the Old Republicans [in the South] to provide him with a margin of victory on the closely contested Missouri [statehood] bill while saved their pride by voting against the Thomas Proviso.\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 381</ref> The Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, the House sustaining its northern antislavery position, and the Senate blocking a slavery restricted statehood.\n\nThe Missouri Compromise was controversial at the time, as many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectional lines. The [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857). This increased tensions over slavery and eventually led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==Era of Good Feelings and party \"amalgamation\"==\n[[File: James Monroe 02.jpg|thumb|President James Monroe: signer of the Missouri Compromise bills<ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 457-458</ref>]]\n\nThe [[Era of Good Feelings]], closely associated with the administration of President george washington (1817\u20131825), was characterized by the dissolution of national political identities.<ref>Ammon, 1958, p. 4: \"The phrase 'Era of Good Feelings', so inextricably associated with the administration of James Monroe ...</ref><ref>Brown, 1966. p. 23: \"So long as the Federalists remained an effective opposition, Jefferson's party worked as a party should. It maintained its identity in relation to the opposition by a moderate and pragmatic advocacy of strict construction of the Constitution. Because it had competition, it could maintain discipline. It responded to its constituent elements because it depended on them for support. But eventually, its very success was its undoing. After 1815, stirred by the nationalism of the postwar era, and with the Federals in decline, the Republicans took up Federalist positions on a number of the great public issues of the day, sweeping all before then as they did. The Federalists gave up the ghost. In the \"Era of Good Feelings\" that followed, everybody began to call himself a Republican, and a new theory of party amalgamation preached the doctrine that party division was bad and that a one-party system best served the national interest. Only gradually did it become apparent that in victory, the Republican's party had lost its identity, and it's usefulness. As the party of the whole nation, it ceased to be responsive to any particular elements in its constituency. It ceased to be responsive to the North ... When it did [become unresponsive], and because it did, it invited the Missouri crisis of 1819\u20131820 ...\"</ref> With the [[Hartford Convention|discredited]] Federalists in decline nationally, the \"amalgamated\" or hybridized Republicans adopted key Federalist economic programs and institutions, further erasing party identities and consolidating their victory.<ref>Ammon, 1958, p. 5: \"Most Republicans like former President [James] Madison readily acknowledged the shift that had taken place within the Republican party towards Federalist principles and viewed the process without qualms. And p. 4: \"... The Republicans had taken over (as they saw it) that which was of permanent value in the Federal program.\" And p. 10: \"... Federalists had vanished\" from national politics.</ref><ref>Brown, 1966, p. 23: \"... a new theory of party amalgamation preached the doctrine that party division was bad and that a one-party system best served the national interest\" and \"After 1815, stirred by the nationalism of the post-war era, and with the Federalists in decline, the Republicans took up the Federalist positions on a number of the great public issues of the day, sweeping all before them as they did. The Federalists gave up the ghost.\"</ref>\n  \nThe economic nationalism of the Era of Im big fat and not that like Good Feelings that would authorize the [[Tariff of 1816]] and incorporate the [[Second Bank of the United States]] portended an abandonment of the Jeffersonian political formula for [[Strict constructionism|strict construction]] of the constitution, a limited central government and commitments to the primacy of Southern agrarian interests.<ref>Brown, 1966, p. 22: \"The insistence(FILL) ... outside the South\" and p. 23: The amalgamated Republicans, \"as a party of the whole nation ... ceased to be responsive to any particular elements in its constituency. It ceased to be responsive to the South.\" And \"The insistence that slavery was uniquely a Southern concern, not to be touched by outsiders, had been from the outset a sine qua non for Southern participation in national politics. It underlay the Constitution and its creation of a government of limited powers ...\"<br />Brown, 1966, p. 24: \"Not only did the Missouri crisis make these matters clear [the need to revive strict constructionist principles and quiet anti-slavery agitation], but \"it gave marked impetus to a reaction against nationalism and amalgamation of postwar Republicanism\" and the rise of the Old Republicans.</ref><ref>Ammon, 1971 (James Monroe bio) p. 463: \"The problems presented by the [consequences of promoting Federalist economic nationalism] gave an opportunity to the older, more conservative [Old] Republicans to reassert themselves by attributing the economic dislocation to a departure from the principles of the Jeffersonian era.\"</ref> The end of opposition parties also meant the end of party discipline and the means to suppress internecine factional animosities. Rather than produce political harmony, as President James Monroe had hoped, amalgamation had led to intense rivalries among Jeffersonian Republicans.<ref>Parsons, 2009, p. 56: \"Animosity between Federalists and Republicans had been replaced by animosity between Republicans themselves, often over the same issues that had once separated them from the Federalists.\"</ref>\n \nIt was amid the \"good feelings\" of this period \u2013 during which Republican Party discipline was in abeyance \u2013 that the [[Tallmadge Amendment]] surfaced.<ref>Brown, 1966, p.28: \"... amalgamation had destroyed the levers which made party discipline possible.\"</ref>\n\n==Louisiana Purchase and Missouri Territory==\nThe immense [[Louisiana Purchase]] territories had been acquired through federal executive action, followed by Republican legislative authorization in 1803 during the [[Thomas Jefferson]] administration.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 36<br />Ammons, 1971. p. 206<br />Ellis, 1996. p. 266: \"Jefferson had in fact worried out loud that the constitutional precedent he was setting with the acquisition of Louisiana in 1803. In that sense his worries proved to be warranted. The entire congressional debate of 1819\u20131820 over the Missouri Question turned on the question of federal versus state sovereignty, essentially a constitutional conflict in which Jefferson's long-standing opposition to federal power was clear and unequivocal, the Louisiana Purchase being the one exception that was now coming back to haunt him. But just as the constitutional character of the congressional debate served only to mask the deeper moral and ideological issues at stake, Jefferson's own sense of regret at his complicity in providing the constitutional precedent for the Tallmadge amendment merely scratched that surface of his despair.\"</ref>\n\nPrior to its purchase in 1803, the governments of Spain and France had sanctioned slavery in the region. In 1812, the state of Louisiana, a major cotton producer and the first to be carved from the Louisiana Purchase, had entered the Union as a slave state. Predictably, Missourians were adamant that slave labor should not be molested by the federal government.<ref>Malone, 1960. p. 419: \"[S]everal thousand planters took their slaves into the area believing that Congress would do nothing to disturb the institution, which had enjoyed legal protection in the territory of the Louisiana Purchase under its former French and Spanish rulers.\"</ref> In the years following the War of 1812, the region, now known as [[Missouri Territory]], experienced rapid settlement, led by slaveholding planters.<ref>Malone, 1969. p.419: \"After 1815, settlers had poured across the Mississippi ... Several thousand planters took their slaves in the area ...\"</ref>\n\nAgriculturally, the land comprising the lower reaches of the Missouri River, from which that new state would be formed, had no prospects as a major cotton producer. Suited for diversified farming, the only crop regarded as promising for slave labor was hemp culture. On that basis, southern planters immigrated with their chattel to Missouri, the slave population rising from 3,100 in 1810 to 10,000 in 1820. In a total population 67,000, slaves represented about 15 percent.<ref>Dangerfield, 1966. p. 109<br />Wilentz, 2004. P. 379: \"Missouri, unlike Louisiana, was not suited to cotton, but slavery had been established in the western portions, which were especially promising for growing hemp, a crop so taxing to cultivate that it was deemed fit only for slave labor. Southerners worried that a ban on slavery in Missouri, already home to 10,000 slaves \u2013 roughly fifteen percent of its total population [85% whites] \u2013 would create a precedent for doing so in all the entering states from the trans-Mississippi West, thereby establishing congressional powers that slaveholders denied existed</ref>\n\nBy 1818, the population of Missouri territory was approaching the threshold that would qualify it for statehood. An enabling act was provided to Congress empowering territorial residents to select convention delegates and draft a state constitution.<ref>Howe, 2004, p. 147: \"By 1819, enough settlers had crossed the Mississippi River that Missouri Territory could meet the usual population criterion for admission to the Union.\" And \"an 'enabling act' was presented to Congress [for Missouri statehood].\"<br />Malone, 1960. p. 419: \"[S]ettlement had reached the point where Missouri, the next state [after Louisiana state] to be carved out of the Louisiana Purchase, straddled the line between the free and slave states.\"</ref> The admission of Missouri territory as a slave state was expected to be more or less routine.<ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 449: \"Certainly no one guessed in February 1819 the extent to which passions would be stirred by the introduction of a bill to permit Missouri to organize a state government.\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 379: \"When the territorial residents of Missouri applied for admission to the Union, most Southerners\u2014and, probably, at first, most Northerners\u2014assumed slavery would be allowed. All were in for a shock.\"<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 107: Prior to the Tallmadge debates, the 15th Congress there had been \"certain arguments or warnings concerning congressional powers in the territories; none the less ... [Tallmadge's amendment] caught the House off its guard.\"</ref>\n\n==Congress Debates: 1819==\n[[File: James Tallmadge portrait.jpg|thumb|Representative [[James Tallmadge Jr.]], author of the antislavery amendment to Missouri statehood]]\n\nWhen the Missouri statehood bill was opened for debate in the House of Representative on February 13, 1819, early exchanges on the floor proceeded without serious incident.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 106-107</ref> In the course of these proceedings, however, Representative [[James Tallmadge Jr.]] of New York \"tossed a bombshell into the Era of Good Feelings\" with the following amendments:<ref>Howe, 2004. p. 147</ref>\n\n{{quote|Provided, that the further introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude be prohibited, except for the punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been fully convicted; and that all children born within the said State will be executed after the admission thereof into the Union, shall be free at the age of twenty-five years.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 107</ref>}}\n\nA political outsider, the 41-year old Tallmadge conceived his amendment based on a personal aversion to slavery. He had played a leading role in accelerating emancipation of the remaining slaves in New York in 1817. Moreover, he had campaigned against Illinois' Black Codes: though ostensibly free-soil, the new Illinois state constitution permitted indentured servitude and a limited form of slavery.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965, p. 110: \"When Tallmadge, in 1818, attacked the indentured service and limited slavery provisions in the Illinois constitution, only thirty-four representatives voted with him against admission. The Tallmadge amendment of 1819, therefore, must also be considered the first serious challenge to the extension of slavery.</ref><ref>Howe, 2004. p. 147: \"Tallmadge was an independent-minded Republican, allied at the time with Dewitt Clinton's faction in New York state politics. The year before, he had objected to the admission of Illinois on the (well-founded) grounds that its constitution did not provide enough assurance that the Northwest Ordinance prohibition on slavery would be perpetuated.\"<br />Wilentz, 2004. p. 379: \"In 1818, when Illinois gained admission to the Union, antislavery forces won a state constitution that formally barred slavery but included a fierce legal code that regulated free blacks and permitted the election of two Southern-born senators.\"</ref> As a New York Republican, Tallmadge maintained an uneasy association with Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]], a former Republican who depended on support from ex-Federalists. Clinton's faction was hostile to Tallmadge for his spirited defense of General [[Andrew Jackson]] over his contentious [[Seminole Wars#Jackson invades Florida|invasion]] of [[Florida]].<ref>Howe 2010</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 378: \"A Poughkeepsie lawyer and former secretary to Governor George Clinton, Tallmadge had served in Congress for just over two years when he made his brief but momentous appearance in national politics. He was known as a political odd duck. Nominally an ally and kin, by marriage, of De Witt Clinton, who nonetheless distrusted him, Tallmadge was disliked by the surviving New York Federalists, who detested his defense of General Andrew Jackson against attacks on Jackson's military command in East Florida.<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 107-108: \"James Tallmadge, Jr. a representative [of New York state] ... was supposed to be a member of the [DeWitt Clinton] faction in New York politics ... may have offered his amendment because his conscience was affronted, and for no other reason.</ref>\n \nAfter proposing the amendment, Tallmadge fell ill, Congressman [[John W. Taylor (politician)|John W. Taylor]], a fellow New York Republican, stepped in to fill the void. Taylor also had antislavery credentials, in February 1819, he had proposed a similar slave restriction for [[Arkansas Territory]] in the House (which was defeated 89\u201387).<ref>Dangerfield, 1965: p. 107, footnote 28: In February 1819,[Taylor, attempted] to insert into a bill establishing a Territory of Arkansas an antislavery clause similar to [the one Tallmadge would shortly present] ... and it \"was defeated in the House 89-87.\"<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 122</ref> In a speech before the House during the debate on the Tallmadge Amendment, Taylor was highly critical of Southern lawmakers who frequently voiced their dismay that slavery was entrenched and necessary to their existence, and warned that Missouri's fate would \"decide the destiny of millions\" in future states in the [[Western United States|American West]].<ref name=AA1232019>{{cite web| last=Gooley| first=Lawrence P.| url=https://www.adirondackalmanack.com/2019/01/john-w-taylor-new-yorks-almost-only-speaker-of-the-house.html| title=John W.

Southern Jeffersonian united in almost unanimous opposition. The ensuing debates pitted the northern \"restrictionists\" (antislavery legislators who wished to bar slavery from the Louisiana territories) and southern \"anti-restrictionists\" (proslavery legislators who rejected any interference by Congress inhibiting slavery expansion).<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p.380,386</ref> The sectional \"rupture\" over slavery among Jeffersonian Republicans, first exposed in the Missouri crisis, had its roots in the Revolutionary generation.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 376: \"Jeffersonian rupture over slavery drew upon ideas from the Revolutionary era. It began with congressional conflicts over slavery and related matter in the 1790s.

This acknowledgment of state sovereignty provided for the participation of those states most committed to slave labor. With this understanding, slaveholders had cooperated in authorizing the [[Northwest Ordinance]] in 1787, and to outlawing the trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1808.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 22: \"The insistence that slavery was uniquely a Southern concern, not to be touched by outsiders, had been from the outset a sine qua non for Southern participation in national politics.

This was manifest in the shift towards diversified farming in the Upper South, and in the gradual emancipation of slaves in New England, and more significantly, in the mid-Atlantic states. Beginning in the 1790s, with the introduction of the cotton gin, and by 1815, with the vast increase in demand for cotton internationally, slave-based agriculture underwent an immense revival, spreading the institution westward to the Mississippi River. Slavery opponents in the South vacillated, as did their hopes for the imminent demise of human bondage.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 383: \"Not since the framing and ratification of the Constitution in 1787\u201388 had slavery caused such a tempest in national politics. In part, the breakthrough of emancipation in the Middle States after 1789\u2014especially in New York, where James Tallmadge played a direct role\u2014emboldened Northern antislavery opinion. Southern slavery had spread since 1815. After the end of the War of 1812, and thanks to new demand from the Lancashire mills, the effects of Eli Whitney's cotton gin, and the new profitability of upland cotton, slavery expanded into Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Between 1815 and 1820, U.S. cotton production doubled, and, between 1820 and 1825, it doubled again. Slavery's revival weakened what had been, during the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary era, a widespread assumption in the South, although not in South Carolina and Georgia, that slavery was doomed. By the early 1820s, Southern liberal blandishments of the post-Revolutionary years had either fallen on the defensive or disappeared entirely</ref>\n \nHowever rancorous the disputes among Southerners themselves over the virtues of a slave-based society, they united as a section when confronted by external challenges to their institution. The free states were not to meddle in the affairs of the slaveholders.

Known as the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths clause]] or the \"federal ratio\", three-fifths (60%) of the slave population was numerically added to the free population. This sum was used to calculate Congressional districts per state and the number of delegates to the Electoral College. The federal ratio produced a significant number of legislative victories for the South in the years preceding the Missouri crisis, as well as augmenting its influence in party caucuses, the appointment of judges and the distribution of patronage. It is unlikely that the three-fifths clause, prior to 1820, was decisive in affecting legislation on slavery. Indeed, with the rising northern representation in the House, the South's share of the membership had declined since the 1790s.<ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 101: \"The three-fifths clause certainly inflated Southerner's power in the House, not simply in affecting numerous roll-call votes \u2013 roughly one in three overall of those recorded between 1795 to 1821 \u2013 but in shaping the politics of party caucuses ... patronage and judicial appointments. Yet even with the extra seats, the share held by major slaveholding states actually declined between 1790 to 1820, from 45% to 42% ... [and] none of the bills listed in the study concerned slavery, whereas in 1819, antislavery Northerners, most of them Jeffersonian Republicans, rallied a clear House majority to halt slavery's expansion.\"</ref><ref>Varon, 2008. p. 40: \"The three-fifths clause inflated the South's representation in the House. Because the number of presidential electors assigned to each state was equal to the size of its congressional delegation ... the South had power over the election of presidents that was disproportionate to the size of the region's free population ... since Jefferson's accession in 1801, a \"Virginia Dynasty\" had ruled the White House.\"<br />Malone, 1960. p. ?: \"The constitutional provision relating to slavery that bore most directly on the [Missouri controversy] was the three-fifths ratio of representation, sometimes called the federal ratio. The representation of any state in the lower house of Congress was based on the number of its free inhabitants, push three-fifths of its slaves. The free states were now [1820] forging ahead in total population, were now had a definite majority. On the other hand, the delegation from the South was disproportionate to its free population, and the region actually had representation for its slave property. This situation vexed the Northerners, especially the New Englanders, who had suffered from political frustration since the Louisiana Purchase, and who especially resented the rule of the Virginia Dynasty.\"<br />Wilentz, 2016. p. 47: \"[Federalists] objected above all to the increasingly notorious three-fifths clause [which] inflated representation of the Southern states in Congress and the Electoral College\"</ref>\n\nHostility to the federal ratio had historically been the object of the now nationally ineffectual Federalists; they blamed their collective decline on the \"[[Virginia dynasty|Virginia Dynasty]]\", expressed in partisan terms rather than in moral condemnation of slavery. The pro-De Witt Clinton-Federalist faction carried on the tradition, posing as antirestrictionists, for the purpose of advancing their fortunes in New York politics.<ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 99: \"[Federalist hostility to Jefferson and the Virginia Dynasty] nothing about slavery or its cruelties showed up \u2013 except (in what had become a familiar sour-grapes excuse among Federalists for their national political failures) how the three-fifths clause aided the wretched ...

In the 1819 15th Congress debates, he revived his critique as a complaint that New England and the Mid-Atlantic States suffered unduly from the federal ratio, declaring himself \"degraded\" (politically inferior) to the slaveholders. Federalists, North and South, preferred to mute antislavery rhetoric, but during the 1820 debates in the 16th Congress, King and other old Federalists would expand their critique to include moral considerations of slavery.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 385: \"More than thirty years after fighting the three-fifths clause at the Federal Convention, King warmly supported banning slavery in Missouri, restating the Yankee Federalist fear of Southern political dominance that had surfaced at the disgraced Hartford Convention in 1814. The issue, for King, at least in his early speeches on Missouri, was not chiefly moral. King explicitly abjured wanting to benefit either slaves or free blacks. His goal, rather, was to ward off the political subjugation of the older northeastern states\u2014and to protect what he called 'the common defense, the general welfare, and [the] wise administration of government.' Only later did King and other Federalists begin pursuing broader moral and constitutional indictments of slavery.</ref><ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 121, footnote 64</ref>\n\nRepublican James Tallmadge, Jr. and the Missouri restrictionists deplored the three-fifths clause because it had translated into political supremacy for the South. They had no agenda to remove it from the founding document, only to prevent its further application west of the Mississippi River.<ref>Varon, 2008. p. 39: \"... they were openly resentful of the fact that the three-fifths clause had translated into political supremacy for the South.<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 109: \"[The federal ratio] hardly agreed with [the restrictionists] various interests for this apportionment to move across the Mississippi River. Tallmadge [remarked the trans-Mississippi region] 'had no claim to such unequal representation, unjust upon the other States.\"</ref><ref>Howe, 2004. p. 150: \"The Missouri Compromise also concerned political power ... many [Northerners] were increasingly alarmed at the disproportionate political influence of the southern slaveholders ... [resenting the three-fifths clause].\"</ref>\n\nAs determined as Southern Republicans were to secure Missouri statehood with slavery, the three-fifths clause failed to provide the margin of victory in the 15th Congress. Blocked by Northern Republicans \u2013 largely on egalitarian grounds \u2013 with sectional support from Federalists, the bill would die in the upper house, where the federal ratio had no relevance. The \"balance of power\" between the sections, and the maintenance of Southern preeminence on matters related to slavery resided in the Senate.<ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 102-103: \"The three-fifths clause guaranteed the South a voting majority on some, but hardly all [critical matters] ... Indeed, the congressional bulwark of what became known, rightly, as the Slave Power proved not to be the House, but the Senate, where the three-fifths rule made no difference.\" And \"The three-fifths clause certainly did not prevent the House from voting to exclude slavery from the new state of Missouri in 1819. The House twice passed [in the 15th Congress] by substantial margins, antislavery resolutions proposed by [Tallmadge] with the largely Northern Republican majority founding its case on Jefferson's Declaration [of Independence] ... The antislavery effort would die in the Senate, where, again, the three-fifths clause made no difference.\"</ref><ref>Howe, 2004. p. 150: \"...but if slavery were on the road to ultimate extinction in Missouri, the state might not vote with the proslavery bloc. In such power calculations, the composition of the Senate was of even greater moment than that of the House ... So the South looked to preserve its sectional equality in the Senate.\"</ref>\n\n===\"Balance of Power\" in the Senate===\nNorthern voting majorities in the lower house did not translate into political dominance. The fulcrum for proslavery forces resided in the upper house of Congress. There, constitutional compromise in 1787 had provided for exactly two senators per state, regardless of its population: the South, with its small white demographic relative to the North, benefited from this arrangement. Since 1815, sectional parity in the Senate had been achieved through paired admissions, leaving the North and South, at the time of Missouri territory application for statehood, at eleven states each.<ref>Varon, 2008. p. 40: \"[T]he North's demographic edge [in the House] did not translate into control over the federal government, for that edge was blunted by constitutional compromises. The fact that the Founders had decided that each state, however large or small, would elect two senators meant the South's power in the Senate was disproportionate to its population, and that maintaining a senatorial parity between North and South depended on bringing in equal numbers of free and slave states.<br />Ammons, 1971. p. 450: \"The central concern in the debates ... had been over the [senatorial] balance of power, for the Southern congressmen had concentrated their objections upon the fact that the admission of Missouri would forever destroy the equal balance then existing between [the number of] free and slave states.\"</ref>\n\nThe South, voting as a bloc on measures that challenged slaveholding interests and augmented by defections from Free State Senators with Southern sympathies, was able to tally majorities. The Senate stood as the bulwark and source of the [[Slave Power]] \u2013 a power that required admission of slave states to the Union to preserve its national primacy.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 379: \"At stake were the terms of admission to the Union of the newest state, Missouri. The main issue seemed simple enough, but the ramifications were not. Since 1815, in a flurry of state admissions, the numbers of new slave and free states had been equal, leaving the balance of slave and free states nationwide and in the Senate equal. The balance was deceptive. In 1818, when Illinois gained admission to the Union, antislavery forces won a state constitution that formally barred slavery but included a fierce legal code that regulated free blacks and permitted the election of two Southern-born senators. In practical terms, were Missouri admitted as a slave state, the Southern bloc in the Senate might enjoy a four-vote, not a two-vote majority.<br />Howe, 2004. p. 150</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 102: \"The congressional bulwark of what came to be known, rightly, as the [[Slave Power]] proved not to be the House but the Senate ...\"</ref>\n\nMissouri statehood, with the Tallmadge amendment approved, would set a trajectory towards a Free State trans-Mississippi and a decline in Southern political authority. The question as to whether the Congress could lawfully restrain the growth of slavery in Missouri took on great importance among the slave states. The moral dimensions of the expansion of human bondage would be raised by Northern Republicans on constitutional grounds.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 114-115: \"The political and sectional problem originally raised by the Tallmadge amendment, the problem of the control of the Mississippi Valley, quite failed to conceal [the] profound renumciation of human rights.\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 387: \"According to the Republicans, preservation of individual rights and strict construction of the Constitution demanded the limitation of slavery and the recognition ...

The free inhabitants of Missouri, either in the territorial phase or during statehood, had the right to establish slavery \u2013 or disestablish it \u2013 exclusive of central government interference.

In doing so, he set a Constitutional precedent that would serve to rationalize Tallmadge's federally imposed slavery restrictions.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p, 379: footnote (8)<br />Ellis, 1995. p.266</ref>\n\nThe 15th Congress debates, focusing as it did on constitutional questions, largely avoided the moral dimensions raised by the topic of slavery.

This would require halting the spread of slavery westward, and confine the institution to where it already existed. Faced with a population of 1.5 million slaves, and the lucrative production of cotton, the South would abandon hopes for containment. Slaveholders in the 16th Congress, in an effort to come to grips with this paradox, would resort to a theory that called for extending slavery geographically so as to encourage its decline: \"diffusion\".<ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 268: \"Only a gradual policy of emancipation was feasible, but the mounting size of the slave population made any gradual policy unfeasible ... and made any southern-sponsored solution extremely unlikely ... the enlightened southern branch of the revolutionary generation ... had not kept its promise to [relinquish slavery].\" and p. 270: \"All [of the Revolutionary generation at the time] agreed that ending slavery depended on confining it to the South ... isolating it in the South.\"</ref><ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 450: \"...if slavery were confined to the states where it existed, the whites would eventually desert these regions ... would the [abandoned area] be accepted as black republics with representation in Congress? ... a common southern view [held] that the best way to ameliorate the lot of the slave and [achieving] emancipation, was by distributing slavery throughout the Union.\"</ref>\n\n==Stalemate==\nOn February 16, 1819, the House [[Committee of the Whole]] voted to link Tallmadge's provisions with the Missouri enabling legislation, approving the move 79-67.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 110</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 379-380</ref> Following the committee vote, debates resumed over the merits of each of Tallmadge's provisions in the enabling act.

He drew his conclusion from several circumstances ... [Rufus King had emerged] as the outstanding congressional spokesman of the restrictionists ... [and that he] was in league with De Witt Clinton [who was pursuing his own presidential ambitions outside the Republican Party] ... to [Monroe's] way of thinking, the real objective of these leaders was power ... that they were willing to accept disunion if their plans could not be achieved in any other fashion ... [and that] Tallmadge was one of Clinton's close associates [added weight to his suspicions] ... [ The union could not] survive  the formation of parties based on a North-South sectional alignment.\"<br />Ellis, 1995. p. 270: \"The more [Thomas Jefferson] though about the debate over Missouri, the more he convinced himself that the real agenda had little to do with slavery at all\"</ref><ref>Howe, 2004. p. 151: \"Republicans [in Congress] accused [King] of fanning flames of northern sectionalism is revitalize the Federalist Party.\"<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 119: \"An insinuation, made very early in the House [by Mr. Holmes, who wish to detach the Maine statehood from that of Missouri] was the first to suggest that the purpose behind the movement to restrict [slavery in] Missouri was a new alignment of parties. New York, he hinted, was the center of this conspiracy; and he barely concealed his belief that Rufus King and [Governor] De Witt Clinton \u2013 a Federalist and (many believed) a crypto-Federalist \u2013 were its leaders.\" And \"In 1819 [King had expressed himself] with ... too great a warmth in favor of the Tallmadge amendment, and in January 1820, he was re-elected to the by a legislative composed [of both New York factions] ... From then onward, the notion that a Federalist-Clintonian alliance was 'plotting' to build a new northern party out of the ruins of the Republican Ascendency was never absent from the Missouri debates.\"</ref> Southern Jeffersonian Republican leadership, including President Monroe and former President Thomas Jefferson, considered it as an article of faith that Federalists, given the chance, would destabilize the Union so as to re-impose monarchal rule in North America, and \"consolidate\" political control over the people by expanding the functions of the central government. Jefferson, at first unperturbed by the Missouri question, soon became convinced that a northern conspiracy was afoot, with Federalists and crypto-Federalists posing as Republicans, using Missouri statehood as a pretext.<ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 270-271</ref>\n\nDue to the disarray of the Republican Ascendency brought about by amalgamation, fears abounded among Southerners that a Free State party might take shape in the event that Congress failed to reach an understanding over Missouri and slavery: Such a party would threaten Southern preeminence. Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] of Massachusetts surmised that the political configuration for just such a sectional party already existed.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 23</ref><ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 217: \"'Consolidation' was the new term that Jefferson embraced \u2013 other Virginians were using it too \u2013 to label the covert goals of these alleged conspirators. In one sense the consolidations were simply the old monarchists in slightly different guise ... [a] flawed explanation of ... the political forces that had mobilized around the Missouri Question [suspected of being organized] to maximize its coercive influence over popular opinion.\"</ref>\nThat the Federalists were anxious to regain a measure of political participation in national politics is indisputable. There was no basis, however, for the charge that Federalists had directed Tallmadge in his antislavery measures, nor was there anything to indicate that a New York-based King-Clinton alliance sought to erect an antislavery party on the ruins of the Republican Party. The allegations by Southern proslavery interests of a \"plot\" or that of \"consolidation\" as a threat to the Union misapprehended the forces at work in the Missouri crisis: the core of the opposition to slavery in the Louisiana Purchase were informed by Jeffersonian egalitarian principles, not a Federalist resurgence.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 3885-386: \"No evidence exists to show that Clinton or any New England Federalist helped to instigate the Tallmadge amendments. Although most Northern Federalists backed restriction, they were hardly monolithic on the issue; indeed, in the first key vote on Tallmadge's amendments over Missouri, the proportion of Northern Republicans who backed restriction surpassed that of Northern Federalists. \"It is well known\", the New Hampshire Republican William Plumer, Jr. observed of the restrictionist effort, \"that it originated with Republicans, that it is supported by Republicans throughout the free states; and that the Federalists of the South are its warm opponents.\"<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 122: \"There is no trace of a Federalist 'plot', at least as regards the origins of the Tallmadge amendment; there was never a Federalist-Clinton 'conspiracy' ...\"<br />Howe, 2004. p. 151</ref><ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 454-455: \"Although there is nothing to suggest that the political aspirations of the Federalists were responsible for the move to restrict slavery in Missouri, once the controversy erupted for Federalists were not unwilling to consider the possibility of a new political alignment. They did not think in terms of a revival of Federalism, but rather of establishing a liaison with discontented Republicans which would offer them an opportunity to re-engage in political activity in some other form than a permanent minority.\" And p. 458: \"In placing this emphasis upon political implications of the conflict over Missouri [e.g. Federalist 'plots' and 'consolidation'], Monroe and other Southerners obscured the very real weight of antislavery sentiment involved in the restrictionist movement.\"</ref>\n\n==Development in Congress==\n[[File: Missouri Compromise Line.svg|thumb|400px|Extension of the [[Missouri Compromise Line]] westward was discussed by Congress during the [[Texas Annexation]] in 1845, during the [[Compromise of 1850]], and as part of the proposed [[Crittenden Compromise]] in 1860, but the line never reached the Pacific.]]\n\nTo balance the number of \"slave states\" and \"free states\", the northern region of what was then [[Massachusetts]], the [[District of Maine]], ultimately gained [[admission to the Union|admission into the United States]] as a free state to become [[Maine]]. This only occurred as a result of a compromise involving slavery in Missouri, and in the federal territories of the American West.<ref>[[#Dixon|Dixon, 1899]] p. 184</ref>\nThe admission of another slave state would increase the South's power at a time when northern politicians had already begun to regret the Constitution's [[Three-Fifths Compromise]]. Although more than 60 percent of [[White Americans|whites]] in the United States lived in the North, by 1818 northern representatives held only a slim majority of congressional seats. The additional political representation allotted to the South as a result of the Three-Fifths Compromise gave southerners more seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] than they would have had if the number was based on just free population. Moreover, since each state had two Senate seats, Missouri's admission as a slave state would result in more southern than northern senators.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom On My Mind: A History of African Americans|last = White|first = Deborah Gray|publisher = Bedford/St. Martin's|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Boston|pages = 215}}</ref> A bill to enable the people of the [[Missouri Territory]] to draft a constitution and form a government preliminary to admission into the Union came before the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in [[Committee of the Whole]], on February 13, 1819. [[James Tallmadge]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] offered an amendment, named the [[Tallmadge Amendment]], that forbade further introduction of slaves into Missouri, and mandated that all children of slave parents born in the state after its admission should be free at the age of 25. The committee adopted the measure and incorporated it into the bill as finally passed on February 17, 1819, by the house. The [[United States Senate]] refused to concur with the amendment, and the whole measure was lost.<ref>[[#Dixon|Dixon, 1899]] pp. 49\u201351</ref><ref>[[#Forbes|Forbes, 1899]] pp. 36\u201338</ref>\n\nDuring the following session (1819\u20131820), the House passed a similar bill with an amendment, introduced on January 26, 1820, by [[John W. Taylor (politician)|John W. Taylor]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], allowing Missouri into the union as a slave state. The question had been complicated by the admission in December of [[Alabama]], a [[slave state]], making the number of slave and free states equal.  In addition, there was a bill in passage through the House (January 3, 1820) to admit [[Maine]] as a [[free state (United States)|free state]].<ref>[[#Dixon|Dixon, 1899]] pp. 58\u201359</ref>\n\nThe Senate decided to connect the two measures.  It passed a bill for the admission of Maine with an amendment enabling the people of Missouri to form a state constitution. Before the bill was returned to the House, a second amendment was adopted on the motion of [[Jesse B. Thomas]] of [[Illinois]], excluding slavery from the [[Louisiana Territory]] north of the [[parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north]] (the southern boundary of Missouri), except within the limits of the proposed state of Missouri.<ref name=Greeley>Greeley, Horace.

The amendment and the bill passed in the Senate on February 17 and February 18, 1820.  The House then approved the Senate compromise amendment,  on a vote of 90 to 87, with those 87 votes coming from free state representatives opposed to slavery in the new state of Missouri.<ref name=Greeley />  The House then approved the whole bill, 134 to 42, with opposition from the southern states.<ref name=Greeley/>\n\n===Second Missouri Compromise===\nThe two houses were at odds not only on the issue of the legality of slavery but also on the [[Parliamentary procedure|parliamentary question]] of the inclusion of Maine and Missouri within the same bill. The committee recommended the enactment of two laws, one for the admission of Maine, the other an [[enabling act]] for Missouri. They recommended against having restrictions on slavery but for including the Thomas amendment. Both houses agreed, and the measures were passed on March 5, 1820, and were signed by President [[James Monroe]] on March 6.\n\nThe question of the final admission of Missouri came up during the session of 1820\u20131821.  The struggle was revived over a clause in Missouri's new constitution (written in 1820) requiring the exclusion of \"free negroes and mulattoes\" from the state. Through the influence of [[Kentucky]] Senator [[Henry Clay]] \"The Great Compromiser\", an act of admission was finally passed, upon the condition that the exclusionary clause of the Missouri constitution should \"never be construed to authorize the passage of any law\" impairing the privileges and immunities of any U.S. citizen. This deliberately ambiguous provision is sometimes known as the Second Missouri Compromise.<ref>[[#Dixon|Dixon, 1899]] pp. 116\u2013117</ref>\n\n==Impact on political discourse==\nDuring the decades following 1820, Americans hailed the 1820 agreement as an essential compromise almost on the sacred level of the Constitution itself.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=Millard Fillmore: The 13th President, 1850\u20131853|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ueWiEBrTq4C&pg=PA39|year=2011|publisher=Henry Holt |page=39}}</ref> Although the Civil War broke out in 1861, historians often say the Compromise helped postpone the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Alexander|title=Encyclopedia of African American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&pg=PA340|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=340}}</ref>\n\n[[File: US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|thumb|300px|Animation showing the free/slave status of U.S. states and territories, 1789\u20131861, including the Missouri Compromise]]\n\nThese disputes involved the competition between the southern and northern states for power in Congress and for control over future territories.  There were also the same factions emerging as the [[Democratic-Republican party]] began to lose its coherence. In an April 22 letter to [[John Holmes (U.S. politician)|John Holmes]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote that the division of the country created by the [[Missouri Compromise Line|Compromise Line]] would eventually lead to the destruction of the Union:<ref>[[#Brown|Brown, 1964]] p.69</ref>\n\n{{quote|... but this momentous question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror.

To admit Missouri as a slave state would tip the balance in the Senate (made up of two senators per state) in favor of the slave states. For this reason, northern states wanted Maine admitted as a free state. Maine was admitted in 1820<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/today/mar15.html | publisher=Library of Congress  | title=Maine Becomes a State | date=March 15, 1820 | accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref> and Missouri in 1821,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/today/aug10.html | publisher=Library of Congress  | title=Missouri Becomes a State |date=August 10, 1821 | accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref> but no further states were added until 1836, when Arkansas was admitted.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/today/jun15.html | publisher=Library of Congress | title=Arkansas Becomes a State | accessdate=2012-11-18}}\n</ref>\n\nFrom the [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] standpoint, the Compromise of 1820 was important as the example of Congressional exclusion of slavery from U.S. territory acquired since the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. Nevertheless, the Compromise was deeply disappointing to African-Americans in both the North and South, as it stopped the southern progression of gradual emancipation at Missouri's southern border and legitimized slavery as a southern institution.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom On My Mind: A History of African Americans|last = White|first = Deborah Gray|publisher = Bedford/St. Martin's|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Boston|pages = 215\u2013216}}</ref>\n\n==Repeal==\nThe provisions of the Missouri Compromise forbidding slavery in the former [[Louisiana Territory]] north of the [[parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north]] were effectively repealed by [[Stephen A.

As part of the compromise, the legislation prohibited slavery north of the [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 parallel]], excluding Missouri. The [[16th United States Congress]] passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President [[James Monroe]] signed it on March 6, 1820.<ref>Dangerfield, 1966. p. 125<br />Wilentz, 2004. p. 382</ref>\n\nEarlier, on February 1819, Representative [[James Tallmadge Jr.]], a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republican]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood, which included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery, believing that slavery was a state issue settled by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths rule]], which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a states' slave population. Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality\";<ref>Wilentz 2004. p. 387</ref> and \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\".<ref>Wilentz 2004 p. 389</ref>\n\nWhen free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator [[Jesse B. Thomas]] of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36\u00b0 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by those Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]], in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half the anti-restrictionist House Southerners to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso, while maneuvering a number of restrictionist House northerners to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 25: \"[Henry Clay], who managed to bring up the separate parts of the compromise separately in the House, enabling the Old Republicans [in the South] to provide him with a margin of victory on the closely contested Missouri [statehood] bill while saved their pride by voting against the Thomas Proviso.\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 381</ref> The Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, the House sustaining its northern antislavery position, and the Senate blocking a slavery restricted statehood.\n\nThe Missouri Compromise was controversial at the time, as many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectional lines. The [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857).

After 1815, stirred by the nationalism of the postwar era, and with the Federals in decline, the Republicans took up Federalist positions on a number of the great public issues of the day, sweeping all before then as they did. The Federalists gave up the ghost. In the \"Era of Good Feelings\" that followed, everybody began to call himself a Republican, and a new theory of party amalgamation preached the doctrine that party division was bad and that a one-party system best served the national interest.

In that sense his worries proved to be warranted. The entire congressional debate of 1819\u20131820 over the Missouri Question turned on the question of federal versus state sovereignty, essentially a constitutional conflict in which Jefferson's long-standing opposition to federal power was clear and unequivocal, the Louisiana Purchase being the one exception that was now coming back to haunt him. But just as the constitutional character of the congressional debate served only to mask the deeper moral and ideological issues at stake, Jefferson's own sense of regret at his complicity in providing the constitutional precedent for the Tallmadge amendment merely scratched that surface of his despair.\"</ref>\n\nPrior to its purchase in 1803, the governments of Spain and France had sanctioned slavery in the region. In 1812, the state of Louisiana, a major cotton producer and the first to be carved from the Louisiana Purchase, had entered the Union as a slave state. Predictably, Missourians were adamant that slave labor should not be molested by the federal government.<ref>Malone, 1960. p. 419: \"[S]everal thousand planters took their slaves into the area believing that Congress would do nothing to disturb the institution, which had enjoyed legal protection in the territory of the Louisiana Purchase under its former French and Spanish rulers.\"</ref> In the years following the War of 1812, the region, now known as [[Missouri Territory]], experienced rapid settlement, led by slaveholding planters.<ref>Malone, 1969. p.419: \"After 1815, settlers had poured across the Mississippi ... Several thousand planters took their slaves in the area ...\"</ref>\n\nAgriculturally, the land comprising the lower reaches of the Missouri River, from which that new state would be formed, had no prospects as a major cotton producer. Suited for diversified farming, the only crop regarded as promising for slave labor was hemp culture. On that basis, southern planters immigrated with their chattel to Missouri, the slave population rising from 3,100 in 1810 to 10,000 in 1820. In a total population 67,000, slaves represented about 15 percent.<ref>Dangerfield, 1966. p. 109<br />Wilentz, 2004. P. 379: \"Missouri, unlike Louisiana, was not suited to cotton, but slavery had been established in the western portions, which were especially promising for growing hemp, a crop so taxing to cultivate that it was deemed fit only for slave labor. Southerners worried that a ban on slavery in Missouri, already home to 10,000 slaves \u2013 roughly fifteen percent of its total population [85% whites] \u2013 would create a precedent for doing so in all the entering states from the trans-Mississippi West, thereby establishing congressional powers that slaveholders denied existed</ref>\n\nBy 1818, the population of Missouri territory was approaching the threshold that would qualify it for statehood.

This acknowledgment of state sovereignty provided for the participation of those states most committed to slave labor.

This was manifest in the shift towards diversified farming in the Upper South, and in the gradual emancipation of slaves in New England, and more significantly, in the mid-Atlantic states. Beginning in the 1790s, with the introduction of the cotton gin, and by 1815, with the vast increase in demand for cotton internationally, slave-based agriculture underwent an immense revival, spreading the institution westward to the Mississippi River. Slavery opponents in the South vacillated, as did their hopes for the imminent demise of human bondage.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 383: \"Not since the framing and ratification of the Constitution in 1787\u201388 had slavery caused such a tempest in national politics. In part, the breakthrough of emancipation in the Middle States after 1789\u2014especially in New York, where James Tallmadge played a direct role\u2014emboldened Northern antislavery opinion. Southern slavery had spread since 1815. After the end of the War of 1812, and thanks to new demand from the Lancashire mills, the effects of Eli Whitney's cotton gin, and the new profitability of upland cotton, slavery expanded into Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Between 1815 and 1820, U.S. cotton production doubled, and, between 1820 and 1825, it doubled again. Slavery's revival weakened what had been, during the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary era, a widespread assumption in the South, although not in South Carolina and Georgia, that slavery was doomed. By the early 1820s, Southern liberal blandishments of the post-Revolutionary years had either fallen on the defensive or disappeared entirely</ref>\n \nHowever rancorous the disputes among Southerners themselves over the virtues of a slave-based society, they united as a section when confronted by external challenges to their institution. The free states were not to meddle in the affairs of the slaveholders. Southern leaders \u2013 of whom virtually all identified as Jeffersonian Republicans \u2013 denied that Northerners had any business encroaching on matters related to slavery. Northern attacks on the institution were condemned as incitements to riot among the slave populations \u2013 deemed a dire threat to white southern security.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 22: \"... there ran one compelling idea that virtually united all Southerners, and which governed their participation in national politics.

Known as the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths clause]] or the \"federal ratio\", three-fifths (60%) of the slave population was numerically added to the free population. This sum was used to calculate Congressional districts per state and the number of delegates to the Electoral College. The federal ratio produced a significant number of legislative victories for the South in the years preceding the Missouri crisis, as well as augmenting its influence in party caucuses, the appointment of judges and the distribution of patronage. It is unlikely that the three-fifths clause, prior to 1820, was decisive in affecting legislation on slavery. Indeed, with the rising northern representation in the House, the South's share of the membership had declined since the 1790s.<ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 101: \"The three-fifths clause certainly inflated Southerner's power in the House, not simply in affecting numerous roll-call votes \u2013 roughly one in three overall of those recorded between 1795 to 1821 \u2013 but in shaping the politics of party caucuses ... patronage and judicial appointments.

On the other hand, the delegation from the South was disproportionate to its free population, and the region actually had representation for its slave property.

Blocked by Northern Republicans \u2013 largely on egalitarian grounds \u2013 with sectional support from Federalists, the bill would die in the upper house, where the federal ratio had no relevance. The \"balance of power\" between the sections, and the maintenance of Southern preeminence on matters related to slavery resided in the Senate.<ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 102-103: \"The three-fifths clause guaranteed the South a voting majority on some, but hardly all [critical matters] ... Indeed, the congressional bulwark of what became known, rightly, as the Slave Power proved not to be the House, but the Senate, where the three-fifths rule made no difference.\" And \"The three-fifths clause certainly did not prevent the House from voting to exclude slavery from the new state of Missouri in 1819. The House twice passed [in the 15th Congress] by substantial margins, antislavery resolutions proposed by [Tallmadge] with the largely Northern Republican majority founding its case on Jefferson's Declaration [of Independence] ...

So the South looked to preserve its sectional equality in the Senate.\"</ref>\n\n===\"Balance of Power\" in the Senate===\nNorthern voting majorities in the lower house did not translate into political dominance. The fulcrum for proslavery forces resided in the upper house of Congress. There, constitutional compromise in 1787 had provided for exactly two senators per state, regardless of its population: the South, with its small white demographic relative to the North, benefited from this arrangement. Since 1815, sectional parity in the Senate had been achieved through paired admissions, leaving the North and South, at the time of Missouri territory application for statehood, at eleven states each.<ref>Varon, 2008. p. 40: \"[T]he North's demographic edge [in the House] did not translate into control over the federal government, for that edge was blunted by constitutional compromises. The fact that the Founders had decided that each state, however large or small, would elect two senators meant the South's power in the Senate was disproportionate to its population, and that maintaining a senatorial parity between North and South depended on bringing in equal numbers of free and slave states.<br />Ammons, 1971. p. 450: \"The central concern in the debates ... had been over the [senatorial] balance of power, for the Southern congressmen had concentrated their objections upon the fact that the admission of Missouri would forever destroy the equal balance then existing between [the number of] free and slave states.\"</ref>\n\nThe South, voting as a bloc on measures that challenged slaveholding interests and augmented by defections from Free State Senators with Southern sympathies, was able to tally majorities. The Senate stood as the bulwark and source of the [[Slave Power]] \u2013 a power that required admission of slave states to the Union to preserve its national primacy.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 379: \"At stake were the terms of admission to the Union of the newest state, Missouri. The main issue seemed simple enough, but the ramifications were not. Since 1815, in a flurry of state admissions, the numbers of new slave and free states had been equal, leaving the balance of slave and free states nationwide and in the Senate equal. The balance was deceptive. In 1818, when Illinois gained admission to the Union, antislavery forces won a state constitution that formally barred slavery but included a fierce legal code that regulated free blacks and permitted the election of two Southern-born senators. In practical terms, were Missouri admitted as a slave state, the Southern bloc in the Senate might enjoy a four-vote, not a two-vote majority.<br />Howe, 2004. p. 150</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 102: \"The congressional bulwark of what came to be known, rightly, as the [[Slave Power]] proved not to be the House but the Senate ...\"</ref>\n\nMissouri statehood, with the Tallmadge amendment approved, would set a trajectory towards a Free State trans-Mississippi and a decline in Southern political authority. The question as to whether the Congress could lawfully restrain the growth of slavery in Missouri took on great importance among the slave states. The moral dimensions of the expansion of human bondage would be raised by Northern Republicans on constitutional grounds.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 114-115: \"The political and sectional problem originally raised by the Tallmadge amendment, the problem of the control of the Mississippi Valley, quite failed to conceal [the] profound renumciation of human rights.\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 387: \"According to the Republicans, preservation of individual rights and strict construction of the Constitution demanded the limitation of slavery and the recognition ...

The free inhabitants of Missouri, either in the territorial phase or during statehood, had the right to establish slavery \u2013 or disestablish it \u2013 exclusive of central government interference. As to the Northwest Ordinance, Southerners denied that this could serve as a lawful antecedent for the territories of the Louisiana Purchase, as the ordinance had been issued originally under the [[Articles of Confederation]], not under the US Constitution.<ref name=\"Varon, 2008. p. 40\">Varon, 2008. p. 40</ref>\n\nAs a legal precedent, they offered the treaty acquiring the Louisiana lands in 1803: the document included a provision (Article 3) that extended the rights of US citizens to all inhabitants of the new territory, including the protection of property in slaves.<ref name=\"Varon, 2008. p. 40\"/> When slaveholders embraced Jeffersonian constitutional strictures on a limited central government they were reminded that Jefferson, as US President in 1803, had deviated from these precepts when he wielded federal executive power to double the size the United States (including the lands under consideration for Missouri statehood). In doing so, he set a Constitutional precedent that would serve to rationalize Tallmadge's federally imposed slavery restrictions.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p, 379: footnote (8)<br />Ellis, 1995. p.266</ref>\n\nThe 15th Congress debates, focusing as it did on constitutional questions, largely avoided the moral dimensions raised by the topic of slavery. That the unmentionable subject had been raised publicly was deeply offensive to Southern Congressmen, and violated the long-held sectional understanding between free and slave state legislators.<ref>Ellis, 1995. p.266-267: \"[W]hat most rankled Jefferson [and southern Republicans] about the debate over the Missouri Question was that it was happening at all.

This would require halting the spread of slavery westward, and confine the institution to where it already existed. Faced with a population of 1.5 million slaves, and the lucrative production of cotton, the South would abandon hopes for containment. Slaveholders in the 16th Congress, in an effort to come to grips with this paradox, would resort to a theory that called for extending slavery geographically so as to encourage its decline: \"diffusion\".<ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 268: \"Only a gradual policy of emancipation was feasible, but the mounting size of the slave population made any gradual policy unfeasible ... and made any southern-sponsored solution extremely unlikely ... the enlightened southern branch of the revolutionary generation ... had not kept its promise to [relinquish slavery].\" and p. 270: \"All [of the Revolutionary generation at the time] agreed that ending slavery depended on confining it to the South ... isolating it in the South.\"</ref><ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 450: \"...if slavery were confined to the states where it existed, the whites would eventually desert these regions ... would the [abandoned area] be accepted as black republics with representation in Congress? ... a common southern view [held] that the best way to ameliorate the lot of the slave and [achieving] emancipation, was by distributing slavery throughout the Union.\"</ref>\n\n==Stalemate==\nOn February 16, 1819, the House [[Committee of the Whole]] voted to link Tallmadge's provisions with the Missouri enabling legislation, approving the move 79-67.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 110</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 379-380</ref> Following the committee vote, debates resumed over the merits of each of Tallmadge's provisions in the enabling act.

He suggested that Senator Rufus King's \"warm\" support for the Tallmadge amendment concealed a conspiracy to organize a new antislavery party in the North \u2013 a party composed of old Federalists in combination with disaffected antislavery Republicans. The fact that King, in the Senate, and Tallmadge and Tyler, in the House \u2013 all New Yorkers \u2013 were among the vanguard for slavery restriction in Missouri lent credibility to these charges. When King was re-elected to the US Senate in January 1820, during the 16th Congress debates, and with bipartisan support, suspicions deepened and would persist throughout the crisis.<ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 454: \"[President Monroe] and other Republicans were convinced that behind the attempt to exclude slavery from Missouri was a carefully concealed plot to revive the party divisions of the past either openly as Federalism or some new disguise.

[and that he] was in league with De Witt Clinton [who was pursuing his own presidential ambitions outside the Republican Party] ... to [Monroe's] way of thinking, the real objective of these leaders was power ... that they were willing to accept disunion if their plans could not be achieved in any other fashion ... [and that] Tallmadge was one of Clinton's close associates [added weight to his suspicions] ...

From then onward, the notion that a Federalist-Clintonian alliance was 'plotting' to build a new northern party out of the ruins of the Republican Ascendency was never absent from the Missouri debates.\"</ref> Southern Jeffersonian Republican leadership, including President Monroe and former President Thomas Jefferson, considered it as an article of faith that Federalists, given the chance, would destabilize the Union so as to re-impose monarchal rule in North America, and \"consolidate\" political control over the people by expanding the functions of the central government. Jefferson, at first unperturbed by the Missouri question, soon became convinced that a northern conspiracy was afoot, with Federalists and crypto-Federalists posing as Republicans, using Missouri statehood as a pretext.<ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 270-271</ref>\n\nDue to the disarray of the Republican Ascendency brought about by amalgamation, fears abounded among Southerners that a Free State party might take shape in the event that Congress failed to reach an understanding over Missouri and slavery: Such a party would threaten Southern preeminence. Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] of Massachusetts surmised that the political configuration for just such a sectional party already existed.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 23</ref><ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 217: \"'Consolidation' was the new term that Jefferson embraced \u2013 other Virginians were using it too \u2013 to label the covert goals of these alleged conspirators.

[a] flawed explanation of ... the political forces that had mobilized around the Missouri Question [suspected of being organized] to maximize its coercive influence over popular opinion.\"</ref>\nThat the Federalists were anxious to regain a measure of political participation in national politics is indisputable. There was no basis, however, for the charge that Federalists had directed Tallmadge in his antislavery measures, nor was there anything to indicate that a New York-based King-Clinton alliance sought to erect an antislavery party on the ruins of the Republican Party. The allegations by Southern proslavery interests of a \"plot\" or that of \"consolidation\" as a threat to the Union misapprehended the forces at work in the Missouri crisis: the core of the opposition to slavery in the Louisiana Purchase were informed by Jeffersonian egalitarian principles, not a Federalist resurgence.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 3885-386: \"No evidence exists to show that Clinton or any New England Federalist helped to instigate the Tallmadge amendments. Although most Northern Federalists backed restriction, they were hardly monolithic on the issue; indeed, in the first key vote on Tallmadge's amendments over Missouri, the proportion of Northern Republicans who backed restriction surpassed that of Northern Federalists. \"It is well known\", the New Hampshire Republican William Plumer, Jr. observed of the restrictionist effort, \"that it originated with Republicans, that it is supported by Republicans throughout the free states; and that the Federalists of the South are its warm opponents.\"<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 122: \"There is no trace of a Federalist 'plot', at least as regards the origins of the Tallmadge amendment; there was never a Federalist-Clinton 'conspiracy' ...\"<br />Howe, 2004. p. 151</ref><ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 454-455: \"Although there is nothing to suggest that the political aspirations of the Federalists were responsible for the move to restrict slavery in Missouri, once the controversy erupted for Federalists were not unwilling to consider the possibility of a new political alignment.

The struggle was revived over a clause in Missouri's new constitution (written in 1820) requiring the exclusion of \"free negroes and mulattoes\" from the state. Through the influence of [[Kentucky]] Senator [[Henry Clay]] \"The Great Compromiser\", an act of admission was finally passed, upon the condition that the exclusionary clause of the Missouri constitution should \"never be construed to authorize the passage of any law\" impairing the privileges and immunities of any U.S. citizen.

A geographical line, coinciding with a marked principle, moral and political, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated; and every new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper.<ref>[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]] p.189</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/159.html | title=Thomas Jefferson  to John Holmes | date=April 22, 1820 | accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>}}\n\nThe debate over admission of Missouri also raised the issue of sectional balance, for the country was equally divided between slave and free states with eleven each. To admit Missouri as a slave state would tip the balance in the Senate (made up of two senators per state) in favor of the slave states. For this reason, northern states wanted Maine admitted as a free state. Maine was admitted in 1820<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/today/mar15.html | publisher=Library of Congress  | title=Maine Becomes a State | date=March 15, 1820 | accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref> and Missouri in 1821,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/today/aug10.html | publisher=Library of Congress  | title=Missouri Becomes a State |date=August 10, 1821 | accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref> but no further states were added until 1836, when Arkansas was admitted.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/today/jun15.html | publisher=Library of Congress | title=Arkansas Becomes a State | accessdate=2012-11-18}}\n</ref>\n\nFrom the [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] standpoint, the Compromise of 1820 was important as the example of Congressional exclusion of slavery from U.S. territory acquired since the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. Nevertheless, the Compromise was deeply disappointing to African-Americans in both the North and South, as it stopped the southern progression of gradual emancipation at Missouri's southern border and legitimized slavery as a southern institution.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom On My Mind: A History of African Americans|last = White|first = Deborah Gray|publisher = Bedford/St. Martin's|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Boston|pages = 215\u2013216}}</ref>\n\n==Repeal==\nThe provisions of the Missouri Compromise forbidding slavery in the former [[Louisiana Territory]] north of the [[parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north]] were effectively repealed by [[Stephen A.
