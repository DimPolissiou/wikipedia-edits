The road was engineered by [[Thomas Telford]] and opened in 1821. The pass carries the [[A57 road]] between [[Manchester]] and [[Sheffield]], but it is no longer the main signposted route between those two cities.\n\nLike several other roads that cross the Pennines, Snake Pass has a poor [[Traffic collision|accident]] record compared with roads in the UK generally, although more favourable compared with other roads in the area. It is regularly closed in winter because of snow, and has seen several longer-term closures owing to [[subsidence]] following heavy rain. The road remains a popular route for tourists and motorcycles, however, and sections have been used for semi-professional cycling races such as the [[Tour of Britain]].\n\n==Route and location==\n[[File:Pennine Way at A57 Snake Pass summit - geograph.org.uk - 22692.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pennine Way]] crosses Snake Pass at its summit.]]\nSnake Pass runs through the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]'s [[High Peak Estate]], and lies within the [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]] borough of [[Derbyshire]]; much of it falls within the [[Hope Woodlands]] parish, the remainder being within the [[Charlesworth, Derbyshire|Charlesworth]] parish.<ref name=map/><ref name=cox>{{cite book|title=English inn and tavern names|first=Barrie|last=Cox|publisher=English Place Name Society|year=1994|p=36|isbn=978-0-904889-42-0}}</ref> It is part of the shortest route by road from [[Manchester]] to [[Sheffield]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Failures in earthworks: proceedings of the Symposium on Failures in Earthworks|editor=Institution of Civil Engineers|publisher=Thomas Telford|p=29|year=1985|isbn=978-0-7277-0243-2}}</ref>\n\nThe pass starts east of [[Glossop]] and climbs to the [[Pennines]] [[drainage divide|watershed]] between the moorland plateaux of [[Kinder Scout]] and [[Bleaklow]] to a high point of {{convert|1680|ft|m}} above sea level, where it crosses the [[Pennine Way]].

The road was engineered by [[Thomas Telford]] and opened in 1821. The pass carries the [[A57 road]] between [[Manchester]] and [[Sheffield]], but it is no longer the main signposted route between those two cities.\n\nLike several other roads that cross the Pennines, Snake Pass has a poor [[Traffic collision|accident]] record compared with roads in the UK generally, although more favourable compared with other roads in the area. It is regularly closed in winter because of snow, and has seen several longer-term closures owing to [[subsidence]] following heavy rain. The road remains a popular route for tourists and motorcycles, however, and sections have been used for semi-professional cycling races such as the [[Tour of Britain]].\n\n==Route and location==\n[[File:Pennine Way at A57 Snake Pass summit - geograph.org.uk - 22692.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pennine Way]] crosses Snake Pass at its summit.]]\nSnake Pass runs through the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]'s [[High Peak Estate]], and lies within the [[High Peak (England)|High Peak]] borough of [[Derbyshire]]; much of it falls within the [[Hope Woodlands]] parish, the remainder being within the [[Charlesworth, Derbyshire|Charlesworth]] parish.<ref name=map/><ref name=cox>{{cite book|title=English inn and tavern names|first=Barrie|last=Cox|publisher=English Place Name Society|year=1994|p=36|isbn=978-0-904889-42-0}}</ref> It is part of the shortest route by road from [[Manchester]] to [[Sheffield]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Failures in earthworks: proceedings of the Symposium on Failures in Earthworks|editor=Institution of Civil Engineers|publisher=Thomas Telford|p=29|year=1985|isbn=978-0-7277-0243-2}}</ref>\n\nThe pass starts east of [[Glossop]] and climbs to the [[Pennines]] [[drainage divide|watershed]] between the moorland plateaux of [[Kinder Scout]] and [[Bleaklow]] to a high point of {{convert|1680|ft|m}} above sea level, where it crosses the [[Pennine Way]].

In turn, the pub's name and sign were derived from the serpent on the Cavendish arms of [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]].<ref name=dillon/> In the early 21st century, the inn was renamed the Snake Pass Inn, such that the inn now refers to the road that referred to itself.<ref name=dillon>{{cite book|title=The Pennine Way|first=Paddy|last=Dillon|p=40|publisher=Cicerone Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84965-359-6|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EEbEmUkVf8wC&pg=PA40}}</ref><ref name=turner/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Snake Pass Inn - geograph.org.uk - 5577.jpg|thumb|The Snake Pass Inn was originally called the Snake Inn, but is now named after the pass itself, which in turn was named after the pub.]]\nThe first road between Glossop and Ashopton was the Doctor's Gate, a [[Roman Road]] that follows the Shelf Brook between Shelf Moor and Coldharbour Moor, a route popular today with walkers and [[mountain bike racing|mountain bikers]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Hidden Places of England|publisher=Travel|p=478|year=2000|isbn=978-1-902007-43-4}}</ref> In 1932, an [[Iron Age]] axe thought to be more than 2,000 years old was found near the site of this road.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000541/19321105/225/0010|title=Perfectly Shaped Axe Found near Shopton|newspaper=Derbyshire Times and Chesterfield Herald|date=5 November 1932|accessdate=27 March 2015|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nThe current road further south was designed as a [[toll roads in Great Britain|toll road]] by [[Thomas Telford]] to improve communications east of Glossop, which was expanding as an industrial town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/6497500e-f647-4d1c-8811-03689b770720|title=John Overend Todd Archive: Howard of Glossop Estate|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=26 March 2015}}</ref> It was originally called the Sheffield to Glossop Turnpike and run by a [[turnpike trust]], the Sheffield and Glossop Trust.

The [[London and North Western Railway]] had meanwhile constructed their own line to Buxton from [[Whaley Bridge]] (with a station at [[New Mills Newtown railway station|Newtown]]) which effectively blocked the other two.\n\nAn agreement was reached whereby  the MS&LR would build their proposed \"Marple, New Mills and Hayfield Junction Railway\", while the Midland would extend  its line to New Mills from [[Millers Dale railway station|Millers Dale]] via [[Chinley railway station|Chinley]].  Passenger services began to [[Hayfield, Derbyshire|Hayfield]] in 1868 and the line came under joint control as the [[Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee]] in 1870, while the Midland's line opened in 1867.\n\nAlthough the [[Hayfield branch]] is now closed, as is the tunnel (though a stub of the old branch line through the tunnel was used for some years afterwards as a turnback siding for trains terminating here), users can still travel most of its route on foot, bicycle or horse, along what is now known as the [[Sett Valley Trail]].\n\n==Station==\n[[File:New Mills Central station, May 1980.jpg|thumb|left|New Mills Central station, May 1980]]\nThe [[railway station|station]] lies at the junction of what was the Hayfield branch and the Midland line, the two appearing through tunnels, on a ledge blasted out of the cliff face, some forty feet above the [[River Goyt]].\n\nThe buildings on the down side still exist, as does the stationmaster's house built in 1864. The London line from [[Millers Dale railway station|Millers Dale]] closed in 1967 and the Hayfield branch closed in January 1970, but the station still supports the [[Hope Valley Line]] local service from Sheffield to Manchester.  Stopping trains from Sheffield formerly terminated here and those passengers wishing to travel onwards to Manchester had to change trains (most express services from Sheffield to Manchester ran through without stopping).  This practice ceased, however, when through trains were diverted via Hazel Grove and [[Stockport railway station|Stockport]] in 1986.\n\nThe station does, however, remain a terminus for many services from the Manchester direction \u2014 these can now return directly from the eastbound platform following signalling alterations in 2007 that also saw the remaining semaphore signals at the station replaced by colour lights.  A siding remains at the Marple end of the station to enable empty DMUs to be stabled clear of the main line.\n\nThe booking office on platform 1 is staffed six days per week, from early morning until early afternoon; outside these times, tickets must be bought on the train or in advance of travel.{{update inline|reason=Station now has a ticket machine; ticket office hours are probably less than stated|date=January 2020}}  Train running details are offered via automated announcements, digital display screens and timetable posters.

A self-service ticket machine is also available for use outside these times and for collecting pre-paid tickets.

Step-free access is available to both platforms from the main entrance.<ref>[http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/bux/details.html Buxton station facilities] ''National Rail Enquiries''; Retrieved 17 May 2017</ref>\n\n== Services ==\nUntil May 2018, there was an hourly service daily (including Sundays) between Buxton and Manchester Piccadilly, taking about one hour. The service frequency was enhanced to about half-hourly in the morning and evening peaks. A limited number of trains worked through beyond Manchester, with trains to/from {{stnlnk|Blackpool North}}, [[Clitheroe railway station|Clitheroe]], {{stnlnk|Barrow-in-Furness}}, {{stnlnk|Wigan North Western}}, {{rws|Preston}} and {{stnlnk|Kirkby}}.<ref>{{NRtimes|May 2017|86}}</ref>\n\nFrom 21 May 2018, two trains per hour started running between Manchester and Buxton all day, one of which omits certain stations en route. The evening and Sunday service remains hourly and there are no longer any through trains to/from destinations north of Manchester.<ref>{{NRtimes|May 2018|86}}</ref>\n\nPlatform 2 is the main platform for arrivals and departures. Platform 1 is a departure platform by shunt move, which is usually used in early mornings by the first trains of the day which have been stabled overnight or when attachment/detachment of a unit to/from a formation is required.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n== Future ==\n\nNetwork Rail has proposed, in their North West RUS, installing a facing cross-over which will allow platform 1 to become fully operational as an arrival and departure platform. Doing this will reduce the number of shunt moves.\n\n== History ==\nTwo railways arrived in Buxton almost simultaneously in 1863. The [[Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway]], heavily promoted by the [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]], built its line from [[Manchester]] to [[Whaley Bridge railway station|Whaley Bridge]] and extended it to Buxton. Meanwhile, the [[Midland Railway]] extended the [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]] from [[Rowsley]]. When the Midland extended its main line to [[New Mills]] in 1867, to bypass the LNWR, Buxton became a branch line from [[Millers Dale railway station|Millers Dale]]. The stations were side by side, with identical frontages designed by J. Smith with guidance from [[Joseph Paxton]], each having a [[wrought iron]] glazed [[train shed]].\n\nThe Midland station closed in 1967, along with the line to Rowsley, and the site is now a roadway. However, the line through [[Dove Holes Tunnel]] from Chinley is still used for freight, such as [[limestone]] from [[Tunstead, Derbyshire|Tunstead]], along with the old Midland branch into Buxton and part of the old [[Ashbourne Line]] (closed to passengers in October 1954), which remains in use to serve a lime works at Dowlow and the quarry at Hindlow.  These both join the main line just outside the station, where there also a number of sidings to allow trains to reverse.  The bay platform formerly used by Ashbourne line trains and the connecting curve from it towards Dowlow have been removed, though it is still possible to trace its route.  The LNWR station now handles local trains into Manchester, using its line through [[Dove Holes railway station|Dove Holes]] and [[Chapel-en-le-Frith railway station|Chapel-en-le-Frith]]. The surviving LNWR fan window has been restored and the external stonework cleaned.\n\n=== Accidents ===\n* A runaway limestone train demolished the boiler room and gents toilet and damaged the porters' room in 1897, killing a passenger and injuring a porter.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk//html5/reader/production/default.aspx?&edid=7b86f0f7-498d-4a9a-aa51-b450bfa24a8f|title=What the railways are doing|last=|first=|date=September 1897|website=|publisher=Railway Magazine|pages=282|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> \n* A [[LNWR Class B]] [[Boiler explosion#Locomotive boiler explosions in the UK|boiler blew up]] in the station yard in 1921, killing the driver and fireman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/eventsummary.php?eventID=397|title=Accident at Buxton on 11th November 1921 :: The Railways Archive|website=www.railwaysarchive.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Buxton Railway Station LNWR Fan Window 17.09.2016R.jpg|London & North Western Railway Co fan window after restoration\nFile:Buxton railway station (Derbyshire) in 1978.jpg|[[British Rail Class 104|BR Class 104]] [[Diesel Multiple Unit|DMU]] in the snow, 24 December 1978\nFile:Buxton railway station 1958012 9600359f.jpg|Station exterior in 1965.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of Maitreya{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historical validity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism. This further amplified the idea of him being the primary heir and eldest son of the Buddha, which came to be symbolized by the robe Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had received.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in a next age. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha with the next Buddha Maitreya, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a separate section. In the P\u0101li tradition, this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

Scholar of religion Ellison Banks Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}} Minayev thought the charges were an ancient tradition, because they are not usually the material of legends, because the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] (602\u2013664) reported about a ''[[stupa|st\u016bpa]]'' ({{lang-pi|th\u016bpa|italic=yes}}; a memorial mound or monument) that was erected in memory of the event,<!--31--> and because the ambiguity about what constitutes major and minor rules would have been typical for that period.<!--32-->{{sfn |Minayev |1894 |pp=31\u201332}}\n\nExpanding on the theory of the two factions, Przyluski noted that the figure of \u0100nanda represents Buddhism in an early form, whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents a Buddhism that had undergone reform. \u0100nanda represents a \"religion of love\", whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents \"a rough ascetic spirit\".{{sfn |Analayo |2016 |p=172, note 75}} Migot interpreted \u0100nanda's figure as a devotionalist form of Buddhism focused on the guru, replaced by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's established monasticism with less focus on devotion.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=147 note 57}}\n\nAlthough the Buddha did not appoint a formal successor, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's leading role and seniority effectively made him the head of the ''sa\u1e43gha'' during the first twenty years after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a''.{{sfn |Heim |2004 |p=468}} After the passing away of the Buddha and his close disciples \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, he had become the most influential figure in the Buddhist order.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1990 |pp=84\u201385}} In the Early Buddhist Texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's death is not discussed.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of Maitreya{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historical validity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism. This further amplified the idea of him being the primary heir and eldest son of the Buddha, which came to be symbolized by the robe Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had received.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in a next age. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha with the next Buddha Maitreya, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a separate section. In the P\u0101li tradition, this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

It was incorporated as a meditative topic in the 1228 Chan text ''[[The Gateless Barrier]]'' ({{zh|p=Wumen Guan}}), in which the Buddha confirmed that the mind-to-mind transmission was complete.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2014 |loc=nianhua weixiao}} and {{harvtxt |Harvey |2013 |p=222}}. Harvey states that the story originated among the \"Chan literati\".}} Although the Flower Sermon's main point is to depict a wordless special transmission \"outside the teaching\", the tradition was defended and authorized through Buddhist scripture.{{sfn |Welter |2000 |p=97}}\n\nThe Flower Sermon event is regarded by modern scholars as an invention, but does provide insight into the philosophical concerns and identity of Chan Buddhism.<ref name=\"Herschock\" /> Since Chan Buddhism values the direct transmission from the teacher's mind to that of the student, more so than scriptures, the unbroken lineage of patriarchs is an important part of the tradition.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=fozu}} Moreover, whereas in many Buddhist traditions it was recounted that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa would pass on Gautama Buddha's robe to Maitreya Buddha, in Chan a different tradition developed, in which Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa passed on the robe to the next patriarch \u0100nanda, and so on through a list of Indian and Chinese patriarchs.<!--339--> Some Chan masters, such as [[D\u014dgen]] (1200\u20131253), did believe that this robe would eventually be passed forward to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and eventually Maitreya.<!--340-->{{sfn |Faure |1995 |pp=339\u2013340}}\n\nAs Japanese Buddhist texts saw the transmission of Gautama Buddha's robe as a symbol of birth and gestation, similarly, the flower in the Flower Sermon was seen as a symbol of death and cremation.{{sfn |Faure |1995 |p=361, note 119}} Besides the Flower Sermon, the appearance of the Buddha's feet when Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa pays his final respects, as well as the Buddha sharing his seat with Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa are also considered mind-to-mind transmissions.{{sfn |Do-Ryun |1964 |p=41}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Values ===\n[[File:Mahakasyapa, Kizil, Cave above the Largest Cave, c. 422-529 AD, wall painting - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC01724.JPG|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa depicted with hair and beard.

Monastic vocations and monastic orders tend to be along these two ends of the spectrum,<!--177-178--> with compassionate engagement on the one hand, and dispassionate detachment on the other hand.<!--187--> This can be traced back to these two disciples.<!--178-->{{sfn |Tilakaratne |2003 |pp=177\u2013178, 187}} Specifically, the Therav\u0101da tradition has been influenced much by the model of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=17}} In some early Therav\u0101da texts about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, the values of forest renunciation are contrasted with that of settled monasticism.

Indeed, later Buddhist texts depict Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as the eldest son of the Buddha, who leads both the funerals of his father and, as his heir, presides over the First Council.<!--20-21--> Eventually, he came to be seen as the first teacher after the Buddha and as the beginning of a lineage of teachers. This conceptualization is found within several Buddhist schools, including the Therav\u0101dins and the [[Mahasanghika|Mah\u0101sa\u1e45ghikas]].<!--21-22 n 78-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=17\u201318, note 62, 20\u201322, note 78}} Indeed, Therav\u0101da sees him as a sort of \"Father of the Church\".{{sfn |Lagirarde |2006}}\n\n=== Historical lineages ===\nFurthermore, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is described in the P\u0101li commentary to the ''D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya'' as the person responsible for the preservation of collection that was the precursor to the ''Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya'' and the ''Sa\u1e43yuktaka \u0100gama''. In both the Nik\u0101ya and \u0100gama version of this same collection, therefore, a great deal of attention is given to him, and Tournier thinks it possible that the lineage of teachers preserving this collection, probably originating from the Sth\u0101viras, also conceived themselves as preservers of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's legacy.<!--26--> This is also reflected in the language used in inscriptions from the Sinhalese monk Mah\u0101n\u0101man (5th\u20136th century CE) and in later texts used in the Sinhalese tradition, which both connect Mah\u0101n\u0101man's lineage with that of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, and also that of the future Buddha Maitreya.<!--26-29-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=26\u201329}} However, some P\u0101li sources indicate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was part of the lineage of the ''A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya'' [[Bh\u0101\u1e47aka|reciters]], which is another collection than the ''Sa\u1e43yutta''.{{sfn |Gethin |2008 |p=18}}\n\nOne of the early Buddhist schools, the [[K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya]]s ({{lang-pi|Kassap\u012bya}}), was founded by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, according to scholars [[Paramartha|Param\u0101rtha]] (499\u2013569) and [[Kuiji]] (632\u2013682).

Playable bosses include Andy from [[Combichrist]], Steve from [[And One]], Chris from [[Blutengel]], Graves from [[Aesthetic Perfection]] and Brian from [[The Gothsicles]]. Another new mode was also added, called Tournament Mode, which allows two to four players to compete against each other in a versus/fighting style of gameplay using all the playable characters from the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://facebook.com/FaderheadGame |title=Faderhead 2.0 |publisher=facebook.com/FaderheadGame |date= |accessdate=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n* 2006: ''[[FH1]]'' (Accession Records)\n* 2007: ''[[FH2]]'' (Accession Records)\n* 2008: ''[[FH3]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2010: ''[[Black Friday (Faderhead album)|Black Friday]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2012: ''[[The World of Faderhead]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2013: ''FH4'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2014: ''Atoms & Emptiness'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2016: ''FH-X'' (Not A Robot Records)\n* 2017: ''Night Physics''\n* 2019: ''Asteria''\n\n===Compilation albums===\n* 2010: ''[[Faderhead Trilogy|Trilogy]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2012: ''Two Sides To Every Story'' (2CD) (L-Tracks Recordings)\n\n===EPs===\n* 2009: ''[[Horizon Born]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2011: ''The Way to Fuck Clubs'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2013: ''Empires of the Northern Lights v2.42'' (Bandcamp)\n* 2015: ''The Tokyo Tapes'' (Bandcamp)\n* 2016: ''Anima In Machina'' (Not A Robot Records)\n* 2017: ''No Signal'' (Bandcamp)\n* 2019: ''Starchaser''\n\n===Singles===\n* 2004: \"The Protagonist\"\n* 2006: \"OH Scavenger vs. the Protagonist\"\n* 2006: \"Bassgod\"\n* 2008: \"Exit Ghost\"\n* 2010: \"69 Freaks Per Minute\"\n* 2013: \"Artificial Bullshit (Demo)\"\n* 2017: \"Know Your Darkness\"\n\n===Music videos===\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNNLzpCaymI/ Girly Show]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4GIZGoUyx4/ Exit Ghost]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLptcBLy6Qw/ Tanz Zwo Drei Vier]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG7P6NX8yyE/ Dirtygrrrls/Dirtybois (ft.

The station is {{convert|17+1/2|mi|km}} south east of [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]], on the [[Hope Valley Line]] from [[Sheffield]] to Manchester.  It is unstaffed, and is managed by [[Northern Trains]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe original [[railway station|station]] was built in 1867 by the [[Midland Railway]] on the extension of its [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]] which became its main line to [[London]] from [[Manchester]]. Originally, the Midland had planned to extend through [[Buxton railway station|Buxton]], but the [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]] already had a line there, so the Midland built a line through Chinley and [[Buxworth]] to join the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] at [[New Mills Central railway station|New Mills]], in an association which became known as the [[Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee]].\n\nFrom [[Millers Dale railway station|Millers Dale]] the line crossed the Black Brook valley at [[Chapel Milton]]. This became a double viaduct when the [[Hope Valley line#Dore and Chinley|Dore and Chinley line]] was built in 1894, with a north curve forming a triangular junction just over a mile to the east.  Congestion soon became a problem on the section west of Chinley and so the Midland quickly sought parliamentary approval to add additional capacity, with the enabling act passed in 1900 and the contract for a replacement station let shortly afterwards.\n\nThe new station was opened on 1 June 1902 when the line through Disley Tunnel to [[Heaton Mersey railway station|Heaton Mersey]] (and thence on to {{rws|Manchester Central}}) was opened and the extra tracks between Chinley North Junction & New Mills South Junction commissioned.<ref name=DSCH /> It also became the terminus of the Dore and Chinley line instead of [[Buxton railway station|Buxton]]. The old station buildings were dismantled and re-erected on Maynestone Road as a private house. By 1904 Chinley had become an important junction, between Manchester, [[London St Pancras]] and {{rws|Sheffield}}, with five through platforms & one east-facing bay and four main tracks passing through it.<ref>[http://www.nrm.org.uk/ourcollection/photo?group=Derby&objid=1997-7397_DY_2470 Chinley station - 1903]  ''National Railway Museum'' online photo archive; Retrieved 15 May 2017</ref> Many expresses from the Midlands & London would call there to attach or detach coaches for destinations in the North West (including {{rws|Blackburn}} and {{rws|Liverpool Central}} High Level) as well as the main Midland terminus at Manchester Central.  This practice became somewhat less prevalent after the [[1923 Grouping]] when the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] took over, but in the 1930s some 40 eastbound and 38 westbound trains either called or started/terminated at the station each weekday.<ref name=DSCH />\n\n[[File:1964 Chinley turntable and station.jpg|thumb|1964 view from east]]\n\n===Decline===\n\nAfter World War II and the [[nationalisation]] of the railways in January 1948, passenger traffic from the station declined and the number of station calls with it, though four southbound London expresses and five from the capital still featured in the station's 1965 timetable.  But the 1963 [[Beeching Axe|Beeching Report]] recommended that the Peak District main line to {{rws|Matlock}} and {{rws|Derby}} be closed, as it duplicated the [[West Coast Main Line]] between Manchester Piccadilly and [[London Euston]] (which had recently been electrified).  The Hope Valley route was not included in the report due to the number of isolated communities it served along its route, but the 1902 line through Heaton Mersey to Manchester Central and the link via {{rws|Romiley}} to {{rws|Stockport Tiviot Dale}} would also go, all trains henceforth running to Piccadilly via New Mills & {{rws|Marple}}.\n\nWith the closure of the line to the south in 1967/8 - local passenger services to Buxton (Midland), {{rws|Rowsley}} and Matlock were withdrawn from 6 March 1967<ref name=DSCH /> and the route closed to passengers the following year (along with the line to Manchester Central west of {{rws|Cheadle Heath}}) - Chinley lost its importance. The few surviving London trains via Sheffield ceased to call in 1972 and had disappeared altogether by 1979. Two of the four lines through the station were subsequently removed in 1981/2 as part of a track rationalisation & re-signalling scheme and the platforms they served were closed (along with the station signal box). The remaining two were then realigned to serve the middle [[island platform|'island' platform]] and the remaining buildings were demolished.<ref name=DSCH>{{cite web| url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/c/chinley/| title=Chinley| website=Disused Stations| accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref> The site of the southern island platform has been redeveloped and is now occupied by houses.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3125621 Chinley Station (2012)] Hogg, Graham ''Geograph.org.uk''; Retrieved 30 June 2017</ref><ref name=DSCH />\n\nSince then it has served as a local commuter station on the Hope Valley route, though the line itself still carries significant quantities of freight traffic (mainly [[limestone]] aggregates and cement) in addition to a frequent passenger service.  Many goods trains that pass through still use part of the old route to Buxton to access the quarries at [[Peak Forest]], whilst the line through [[Disley Tunnel]] was reopened to passenger trains in 1986, when a new chord was opened to link it to the {{rws|Stockport}} to Buxton line at {{rws|Hazel Grove}}.  Since the summer 2017 timetable, all fast Sheffield to Manchester services use this route in order to call at Stockport, whilst the Marple route is used by the local stopping services that call here.<ref name = NRT>GB eNRT, December 2016-May 2017 Edition, Table 78</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nThere is a waiting shelter on the platform, along with timetable information posters, [[Passenger information system|CIS displays]], ticket vending machine, bench seating and a customer help point.  Train running details can also be obtained using the telephone at the station entrance.  No level access is available, as the only route from the entrance to the platform is via the stepped footbridge.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/cly/details.html| title=Chinley station facilities| website=National Rail Enquiries| accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref>  Local rail users have been campaigning for the station to be made accessible for wheelchair users and parents with pushchairs since 2008, but the necessary funding under the \"Access for All\" scheme has not yet been allocated.<ref>[http://www.buxtonadvertiser.co.uk/news/fighting-to-get-improved-access-at-chinley-station-1-7730443 \"Fighting to get improved access at Chinley station\"] Grosvenor, Lucy ''Buxton Advertiser'' news article 13 February 2016; Retrieved 30 June 2017</ref>\n\n==Services==\n\nThe typical service is one train every hour to [[Sheffield railway station|Sheffield]] and [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]]. Additionally, a limited number of express trains between Sheffield and Manchester Piccadilly, operated by [[East Midlands Railway]], stop at Chinley in the morning & early evening, giving the station through links to and from [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street]] and {{rws|Nottingham}}.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last=Radford |first=Brian |title= Midland Though The Peak: A Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Routes Between Derby and Manchester |publisher= Unicorn Books |year= 1988 |isbn= 978-1-85241-001-8}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chinley railway station}}\n{{stn art lnk|CLY}}\n\n{{s-rail-start|noclear=yes}}\n{{s-rail|title=National Rail}}\n{{s-rail-national|system=National Rail|toc=Northern Trains|route=[[Hope Valley Line]]|previous=Edale|next=New Mills Central|rowsmid=2}}\n{{s-rail-national|system=National Rail|toc=Northern Trains|route=[[Hope Valley Line]]|next=Hazel Grove|hidemid=yes|note2=Limited service}}\n{{s-rail-national|system=National Rail|toc=East Midlands Railway|route=Liverpool-Norwich|notemid=Limited service|previous=Edale|next=Hazel Grove|rowsmid=2}}\n{{s-rail-national|system=National Rail|next=Stockport|previous=Dore & Totley|hidemid=yes}}\n\n{{Disused Rail Insert}}\n{{rail line two to one |previous1={{stnlnk|Edale}}<br /><small>Line and station open</small> |previous2={{stnlnk|Chapel-en-le-Frith Central}}<br /><small>Line and station closed</small> |next={{stnlnk|Buxworth}}<br /><small>Line open, station closed</small> |route=[[Midland Railway]] |col={{MR colour}} }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Derbyshire stations}}\n\n{{coord|53.340|N|1.944|W|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Railway stations in Derbyshire]]\n[[Category:Former Midland Railway stations]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1867]]\n[[Category:Railway stations served by East Midlands Railway]]\n[[Category:Northern franchise railway stations]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Railway station in Derbyshire, England}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2015}}\n{{Infobox GB station\n| name         = Chinley\n| symbol       = rail\n| code         = CLY\n| image_name   = ChinleyRailwayStation.JPG\n| caption      = Chinley Railway Station\n| manager      = [[Northern Trains]]\n| locale       = [[Chinley]]\n| borough      = [[High Peak (England)|High Peak]]\n<!-- | lowusage0405 = {{pad|1em}}68,169\n| lowusage0506 = {{decrease}} 67,213\n| lowusage0607 = {{increase}} 75,127\n| lowusage0708 = {{increase}} 75,885\n| lowusage0809 = {{increase}} 86,694\n| lowusage0910 = {{increase}} 94,074\n| usage1011    = {{increase}} 0.100\n| lowint1011   = {{pad|1em}}{{increase}} 2,841 \n| usage1112    = {{increase}} 0.103\n| lowint1112   = {{pad|1em}}{{decrease}} 1,565 \n| usage1213    = {{increase}} 0.105\n| lowint1213   = {{pad|1em}}{{decrease}} 1,316\n| usage1314    = {{increase}} 0.108\n| lowint1314   = {{pad|1em}}{{decrease}} 892 --->\n| usage1415    = {{increase}} 0.109\n| lowint1415   = {{pad|1em}}{{increase}} 1,527\n| usage1516    = {{increase}} 0.112\n| lowint1516   = {{pad|1em}}{{increase}} 1,815\n| usage1617    = {{increase}} 0.120\n| lowint1617   = {{pad|1em}}{{decrease}} 1,800\n| usage1718    = {{increase}} 0.121\n| lowint1718   = {{pad|1em}}{{decrease}} 1,442\n| usage1819    = {{increase}} 0.129\n| lowint1819   = {{pad|1em}}{{increase}} 1,654\n| platforms    = 2\n| years1      = 1 July 1902\n| events1      = Moved to current location\n| start        = 1867\n| gridref      = SK038826\n| dft_category = F2\n}}\n'''Chinley railway station''' serves the village of [[Chinley]] in [[Derbyshire]], England.

This practice became somewhat less prevalent after the [[1923 Grouping]] when the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] took over, but in the 1930s some 40 eastbound and 38 westbound trains either called or started/terminated at the station each weekday.<ref name=DSCH />\n\n[[File:1964 Chinley turntable and station.jpg|thumb|1964 view from east]]\n\n===Decline===\n\nAfter World War II and the [[nationalisation]] of the railways in January 1948, passenger traffic from the station declined and the number of station calls with it, though four southbound London expresses and five from the capital still featured in the station's 1965 timetable.  But the 1963 [[Beeching Axe|Beeching Report]] recommended that the Peak District main line to {{rws|Matlock}} and {{rws|Derby}} be closed, as it duplicated the [[West Coast Main Line]] between Manchester Piccadilly and [[London Euston]] (which had recently been electrified).  The Hope Valley route was not included in the report due to the number of isolated communities it served along its route, but the 1902 line through Heaton Mersey to Manchester Central and the link via {{rws|Romiley}} to {{rws|Stockport Tiviot Dale}} would also go, all trains henceforth running to Piccadilly via New Mills & {{rws|Marple}}.\n\nWith the closure of the line to the south in 1967/8 - local passenger services to Buxton (Midland), {{rws|Rowsley}} and Matlock were withdrawn from 6 March 1967<ref name=DSCH /> and the route closed to passengers the following year (along with the line to Manchester Central west of {{rws|Cheadle Heath}}) - Chinley lost its importance. The few surviving London trains via Sheffield ceased to call in 1972 and had disappeared altogether by 1979. Two of the four lines through the station were subsequently removed in 1981/2 as part of a track rationalisation & re-signalling scheme and the platforms they served were closed (along with the station signal box). The remaining two were then realigned to serve the middle [[island platform|'island' platform]] and the remaining buildings were demolished.<ref name=DSCH>{{cite web| url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/c/chinley/| title=Chinley| website=Disused Stations| accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref> The site of the southern island platform has been redeveloped and is now occupied by houses.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3125621 Chinley Station (2012)] Hogg, Graham ''Geograph.org.uk''; Retrieved 30 June 2017</ref><ref name=DSCH />\n\nSince then it has served as a local commuter station on the Hope Valley route, though the line itself still carries significant quantities of freight traffic (mainly [[limestone]] aggregates and cement) in addition to a frequent passenger service.

His disappearance caused some Anti-masons to claim that he had been kidnapped and murdered by Masons. Morgan's disappearance sparked a series of protests against Freemasonry, which eventually spread to the political realm. Under the leadership of anti-Masonic [[Thurlow Weed]], an Anti-Jacksonist movement became (since [[Andrew Jackson|Jackson]] was a Mason) the [[Anti-Masonic Party]].
