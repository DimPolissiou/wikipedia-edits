During the [[American Revolution]], a group of Rebels, hiding beneath the future Keyhouse, discover a portal to another dimension, the [[Leng (plateau)|plains of Leng]] filled with demons who can mesmerize anyone that sees them and possess them through touch. However, when the demons attempt to enter the real world, they transformed into \"whispering\" iron which young smith Benjamin Locke forged into a variety of magical keys, including the Omega Key, which seals the entrance to the dimension. The magic of the Keyhouse gradually evolves over the years, including a spell which causes occupants to forget about the keys and the magic of the house when they pass their 18th birthday. In 1988, a group of teenagers, having used the keys extensively in their high school years to their great delight, decide to open the black door with the Omega Key, hoping to trick a demon into entering the real world in order to provide more metal with which to make more keys. Rendell Locke's younger brother follows the group and is mesmerized by the door and when attempting to walk through it, he is stopped by Dodge who accidentally puts his hand through the door, becoming possessed. After plotting and attempting to kill his friends and enslave the others at the behest of the Child of Leng possessing him, Dodge is killed by Rendell.\n\nMany years later, Dodge's spirit re-enters the physical world through the well at Keyhouse, due to actions taken by Dodge prior to his death. Trapped in the well, Dodge's spirit reaches out to a young abused prodigy, Sam Lesser, and convinces him to attack the Lockes and kill Rendell, looking for the Omega Key, as well as the Anywhere Key, which is capable of freeing Dodge from the well. After the gruesome murder of their father, the Locke kids, Tyler, Kinsey, and Bode move with their mother Nina across the country to Keyhouse and begin discovering its secrets. Sam escapes prison and follows the Lockes to Massachusetts. He attacks the family again at Keyhouse, at which time Dodge tricks Bode into bringing him the Anywhere Key. Dodge escapes from the well, kills Sam and returns to Lovecraft in the same body as he had thirty years before.\n\nDodge re-enters high school under the guise of a new student, intimidating his way into the home of one of Kinsey's teachers and Dodge's former friends. Over the next year, Dodge secretly tries to recover the various keys - in particular the Omega Key - from the children, collecting many, though hindered by Tyler and Kinsey. Dodge is eventually discovered but manages to switch bodies and possess Bode before they can kill him. Now free to explore the house as Bode, Dodge finally finds the Omega Key and plans his takeover after-prom party in the caves. He releases several demons and many of the students are killed. Dodge is ultimately undone by Tyler and Dodge's spirit is forced back into the well, though Bode's empty body is cremated before Bode's soul has a chance to return to it. In the epilogue, Tyler returns to the well to finally free Dodge's spirit from the demon, having used a sliver of whispering iron inherited from his father to forge an \"Alpha Key\" capable of undoing possession. Tyler is able to speak with his father one last time, and he restores Bode's physical form.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe narrative of ''Locke & Key'' has a three-act structure, with each act covering two story arcs.

Some of them are extensively featured in the series, while others are featured very briefly. The known keys are:\n\n* '''Age Key''': Can turn the bearer into an older version of themself, possibly other ages.\n* '''Alpha Key''': Removes demons from possessed people's souls when inserted into their chests. It instantly turns a demon to whispering iron, so if it is still inside the host, it is fatal.\n* '''Angel Key''': Inserted into a harness with large feathered wings, it grants a person the power of winged flight.\n* '''Animal Key''': Used on the right door in Keyhouse, it allows the user to travel through the door and transform into an animal. (It is unclear whether they have choice in the matter. It appears that the key assigns the animal, according to some spiritual affinity.) Returning back through the door transforms a person back into a human. This works for human ghosts that have possessed animal bodies. Animals may also transform into humans if they enter through the opposite side of the door.\n* '''Anywhere Key''': Opens a door to anywhere the bearer can visualize in their mind.\n* '''Chain Key''': Controls the Great Lock, which guards the catacombs with entangling chains.\n* '''Echo Key''': Allows entry to the Keyhouse well house and, with the Echo Key in hand, allows a person to return a spirit from the dead to the world of the living. Leaving through the well house door, however, banishes the spirit back to wherever it came from.\n* '''Gender Key''': Unlocks a half-sized door between rooms which changes the sex of a person who enters it.\n* '''Ghost Key''': When used in the right door in Keyhouse, it separates the soul from the body of whoever travels through the door. The body falls dead while their ghost is free to roam the Keyhouse grounds. Ghost souls can inhabit any other bodies nearby, and clash with other ghosts.\n* '''Giant Key''': This physically large key, once inserted into a keyhole-shaped window in Keyhouse, transforms the bearer into a massive giant.\n* '''Grindhouse Key''': Transforms whatever door it opens into a giant mouth that consumes whatever enters it.\n* '''Harlequin Key''': Unlocks the Harlequin Wardrobe and allows objects not normally inside to be seen.\n* '''Head Key''': Inserted into the base of someone's head, it allows one to peer inside the mind of a person, where memories and mental concepts (including \"sanity\" itself) are represented as tiny beings. The memories can be removed, and swapped between people. Books inserted into a head with the Head Key transfer their contents to the bearer of the key, though in such a situation the knowledge of the text is accurate but superficial.\n* '''Hell Key''': The bearer is automatically the Lord of Hell and has absolute control over Hell.\n* '''Hercules Key''': Embedded in a necklace, it grants the bearer considerable strength and bulk.\n* '''Identity Key''': Upon inserting into the base of one's chin, the bearer can change any aspect of their appearance, including clothes, body, or even gender. Also allows a bearer to forcibly change the appearance of others.\n* '''Jester Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse that contains a number of artifacts and keys.\n* '''Keyhouse Key''': A large key which fits into a stone slab and regenerates the Keyhouse after it is destroyed.\n* '''Matchstick Key''': Creates fires when inserted into a door or touched to an object. Can also cause self-immolation/combustion by inserting into a body.\n* '''Mending Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse into which a broken object can be placed (the cabinet can resize itself to the size of the object). Once the object is locked inside the cabinet, it is repaired. While it can heal severely wounded people, it cannot apparently resurrect the dead.\n* '''Moon Key''': Allows the user to reach and open the Moon like a door, which allows the user to pass on to the afterlife peacefully. Inhabitants who cross the door see the living world like a stage they can observe and afterlife like the backstage of a theater.\n* '''Music Box Key''': Inserted into a magical music box, it will cause the box to play a song that compels whomever is listening to obey its lyrics. Whoever turns the key can supply the commands. Commands are carried out so long as the music is playing and the listener can hear it.\n* ''' Omega Key''': Opens the lock on the demonic door. The first key created.\n* '''Owl Key''': Gives the user control of a mechanical owl.\n* '''Philosophoscope Key''': Gives access to a device that allows viewing of various people and places.\n* '''Reali Key''': Allows passage to alternate dimensions.\n* '''Shadow Key''': Allows its wearer to control shadow creatures, and even the shadows of other people. Shadows are capable of interacting with the material world (often violently) but can be rendered immaterial by bright light. Embedded in a crown, the key is a tremendous source of power for the wearer. \n* '''Skin Key''': A key with a gazing mirror on its handle, it can change the race of whoever is using it.\n* '''Small World Key''': Unlocks a dollhouse replica of Keyhouse, allowing the user to see anything in Keyhouse in realtime. Any interaction with the unlocked dollhouse also occurs within the actual house, such as a house spider entering the dollhouse magically emerging as a giant spider within the real house.\n* '''Splody Key''': Causes explosions in any building it is used within.\n* '''Squirrel/Undertree Key''': Controls squirrels.\n* '''Timeshift Key''': Operates a grandfather clock that allows a user to observe (but not interact with) past events. The clock is limited to a specific time period: the earliest date one can visit is January 13, 1775, and the latest is December 31, 1999.\n* '''Teddy Bear Key''': Animates and controls stuffed teddy bears.\n* '''Thorn Key''': Controls plants, including for offensive purposes.\n* '''Unnamed Riffel Key''': A key created by Hans Riffel, the last person to use whispering iron before Tyler. The key is to the front door of Keyhouse Manor and implements the Riffel Rule, where no one who enters the front door of the house as an adult can directly see the power of the keys. People who age into adulthood will also begin to lose their conscious memories of the keys and their magic.\n\n==Story arcs==\n\n===''Welcome to Lovecraft''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Issue''' !!

During the [[American Revolution]], a group of Rebels, hiding beneath the future Keyhouse, discover a portal to another dimension, the [[Leng (plateau)|plains of Leng]] filled with demons who can mesmerize anyone that sees them and possess them through touch. However, when the demons attempt to enter the real world, they transformed into \"whispering\" iron which young smith Benjamin Locke forged into a variety of magical keys, including the Omega Key, which seals the entrance to the dimension. The magic of the Keyhouse gradually evolves over the years, including a spell which causes occupants to forget about the keys and the magic of the house when they pass their 18th birthday. In 1988, a group of teenagers, having used the keys extensively in their high school years to their great delight, decide to open the black door with the Omega Key, hoping to trick a demon into entering the real world in order to provide more metal with which to make more keys. Rendell Locke's younger brother follows the group and is mesmerized by the door and when attempting to walk through it, he is stopped by Dodge who accidentally puts his hand through the door, becoming possessed. After plotting and attempting to kill his friends and enslave the others at the behest of the Child of Leng possessing him, Dodge is killed by Rendell.\n\nMany years later, Dodge's spirit re-enters the physical world through the well at Keyhouse, due to actions taken by Dodge prior to his death. Trapped in the well, Dodge's spirit reaches out to a young abused prodigy, Sam Lesser, and convinces him to attack the Lockes and kill Rendell, looking for the Omega Key, as well as the Anywhere Key, which is capable of freeing Dodge from the well. After the gruesome murder of their father, the Locke kids, Tyler, Kinsey, and Bode move with their mother Nina across the country to Keyhouse and begin discovering its secrets. Sam escapes prison and follows the Lockes to Massachusetts. He attacks the family again at Keyhouse, at which time Dodge tricks Bode into bringing him the Anywhere Key. Dodge escapes from the well, kills Sam and returns to Lovecraft in the same body as he had thirty years before.\n\nDodge re-enters high school under the guise of a new student, intimidating his way into the home of one of Kinsey's teachers and Dodge's former friends. Over the next year, Dodge secretly tries to recover the various keys - in particular the Omega Key - from the children, collecting many, though hindered by Tyler and Kinsey. Dodge is eventually discovered but manages to switch bodies and possess Bode before they can kill him. Now free to explore the house as Bode, Dodge finally finds the Omega Key and plans his takeover after-prom party in the caves. He releases several demons and many of the students are killed. Dodge is ultimately undone by Tyler and Dodge's spirit is forced back into the well, though Bode's empty body is cremated before Bode's soul has a chance to return to it. In the epilogue, Tyler returns to the well to finally free Dodge's spirit from the demon, having used a sliver of whispering iron inherited from his father to forge an \"Alpha Key\" capable of undoing possession. Tyler is able to speak with his father one last time, and he restores Bode's physical form.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe narrative of ''Locke & Key'' has a three-act structure, with each act covering two story arcs.

Some of them are extensively featured in the series, while others are featured very briefly. The known keys are:\n\n* '''Age Key''': Can turn the bearer into an older version of themself, possibly other ages.\n* '''Alpha Key''': Removes demons from possessed people's souls when inserted into their chests. It instantly turns a demon to whispering iron, so if it is still inside the host, it is fatal.\n* '''Angel Key''': Inserted into a harness with large feathered wings, it grants a person the power of winged flight.\n* '''Animal Key''': Used on the right door in Keyhouse, it allows the user to travel through the door and transform into an animal. (It is unclear whether they have choice in the matter. It appears that the key assigns the animal, according to some spiritual affinity.) Returning back through the door transforms a person back into a human. This works for human ghosts that have possessed animal bodies. Animals may also transform into humans if they enter through the opposite side of the door.\n* '''Anywhere Key''': Opens a door to anywhere the bearer can visualize in their mind.\n* '''Chain Key''': Controls the Great Lock, which guards the catacombs with entangling chains.\n* '''Echo Key''': Allows entry to the Keyhouse well house and, with the Echo Key in hand, allows a person to return a spirit from the dead to the world of the living. Leaving through the well house door, however, banishes the spirit back to wherever it came from.\n* '''Gender Key''': Unlocks a half-sized door between rooms which changes the sex of a person who enters it.\n* '''Ghost Key''': When used in the right door in Keyhouse, it separates the soul from the body of whoever travels through the door. The body falls dead while their ghost is free to roam the Keyhouse grounds. Ghost souls can inhabit any other bodies nearby, and clash with other ghosts.\n* '''Giant Key''': This physically large key, once inserted into a keyhole-shaped window in Keyhouse, transforms the bearer into a massive giant.\n* '''Grindhouse Key''': Transforms whatever door it opens into a giant mouth that consumes whatever enters it.\n* '''Harlequin Key''': Unlocks the Harlequin Wardrobe and allows objects not normally inside to be seen.\n* '''Head Key''': Inserted into the base of someone's head, it allows one to peer inside the mind of a person, where memories and mental concepts (including \"sanity\" itself) are represented as tiny beings. The memories can be removed, and swapped between people. Books inserted into a head with the Head Key transfer their contents to the bearer of the key, though in such a situation the knowledge of the text is accurate but superficial.\n* '''Hell Key''': The bearer is automatically the Lord of Hell and has absolute control over Hell.\n* '''Hercules Key''': Embedded in a necklace, it grants the bearer considerable strength and bulk.\n* '''Identity Key''': Upon inserting into the base of one's chin, the bearer can change any aspect of their appearance, including clothes, body, or even gender. Also allows a bearer to forcibly change the appearance of others.\n* '''Jester Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse that contains a number of artifacts and keys.\n* '''Keyhouse Key''': A large key which fits into a stone slab and regenerates the Keyhouse after it is destroyed.\n* '''Matchstick Key''': Creates fires when inserted into a door or touched to an object. Can also cause self-immolation/combustion by inserting into a body.\n* '''Mending Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse into which a broken object can be placed (the cabinet can resize itself to the size of the object). Once the object is locked inside the cabinet, it is repaired. While it can heal severely wounded people, it cannot apparently resurrect the dead.\n* '''Moon Key''': Allows the user to reach and open the Moon like a door, which allows the user to pass on to the afterlife peacefully. Inhabitants who cross the door see the living world like a stage they can observe and afterlife like the backstage of a theater.\n* '''Music Box Key''': Inserted into a magical music box, it will cause the box to play a song that compels whomever is listening to obey its lyrics. Whoever turns the key can supply the commands. Commands are carried out so long as the music is playing and the listener can hear it.\n* ''' Omega Key''': Opens the lock on the demonic door. The first key created.\n* '''Owl Key''': Gives the user control of a mechanical owl.\n* '''Philosophoscope Key''': Gives access to a device that allows viewing of various people and places.\n* '''Reali Key''': Allows passage to alternate dimensions.\n* '''Shadow Key''': Allows its wearer to control shadow creatures, and even the shadows of other people. Shadows are capable of interacting with the material world (often violently) but can be rendered immaterial by bright light. Embedded in a crown, the key is a tremendous source of power for the wearer. \n* '''Skin Key''': A key with a gazing mirror on its handle, it can change the race of whoever is using it.\n* '''Small World Key''': Unlocks a dollhouse replica of Keyhouse, allowing the user to see anything in Keyhouse in realtime. Any interaction with the unlocked dollhouse also occurs within the actual house, such as a house spider entering the dollhouse magically emerging as a giant spider within the real house.\n* '''Splody Key''': Causes explosions in any building it is used within.\n* '''Squirrel/Undertree Key''': Controls squirrels.\n* '''Timeshift Key''': Operates a grandfather clock that allows a user to observe (but not interact with) past events. The clock is limited to a specific time period: the earliest date one can visit is January 13, 1775, and the latest is December 31, 1999.\n* '''Teddy Bear Key''': Animates and controls stuffed teddy bears.\n* '''Thorn Key''': Controls plants, including for offensive purposes.\n* '''Unnamed Riffel Key''': A key created by Hans Riffel, the last person to use whispering iron before Tyler. The key is to the front door of Keyhouse Manor and implements the Riffel Rule, where no one who enters the front door of the house as an adult can directly see the power of the keys. People who age into adulthood will also begin to lose their conscious memories of the keys and their magic.\n\n==Story arcs==\n\n===''Welcome to Lovecraft''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Issue''' !!

His father, a showband musician who toured the US casino circuit, was absent for most of his life. Through his mother, he first came in contact with music: \u201cIt was cherry pop tarts, Cheetos and a whole lotta AC/DC in my world.\u201c<ref name=\":0\" /> After witnessing what he perceived to be the decline of the golden era of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, Diva first decided to become a musician.\n\nDuring his high school years in San Diego, Diva met guitarist J.J. Love. Having just immigrated to the [[United States|US]] from [[Mexico]], Love introduced Diva to the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], prompting the latter to retain a [[German accent]] to spite his father after an argument. While in school, the two toyed with the idea of forming a band, ultimately not following through. However, Diva first started writing songs during this period.\n\nAfter finishing school, Diva worked odd jobs, finally finding employment as a songwriter for bands such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, [[Guns N' Roses|Guns\u2019N\u2019Roses]], Bon Jovi, and [[Aerosmith]] in 1986. Enjoying his new-found wealth and surrounded by drugs and groupies, he cultivated a hard-partying lifestyle and started collecting cars. Similar themes permeate his music to this day.\n\nThe early nineties\u2019 shift in popular culture towards [[Grunge]] and overall darker motifs saw a decrease in demand for Diva\u2019s music. Financial troubles and alcohol abuse made him overthink his approach to music, with him eventually deciding on forming a band with longtime companion Love.\n\nLooking for more musicians to join them, Diva asked Snake Rocket to play [[guitar]] alongside Love, with former [[NASCAR]] driver Lee Stingray handling the drums and [[Frenchman]] Remmie Martin taking over on [[Bass guitar|bass]] guitar. First playing under the moniker Rockets Of Love in 2009, the five-piece saw little to no opportunities in the US and began focussing on the [[Europe|European]] market.\n\n== Since 2013 ==\nIn Europe, the band first popped up in 2013, bringing a full catalog of [[Classic rock music|classic rock]] songs to stages across the continent.
