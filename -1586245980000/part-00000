One day, he encounters a series of mysterious flyers on his route to work. Intrigued, he decides to take a tag and calls the number, after which he's invited to the Jejune Institute for an induction ceremony. After arriving, Peter receives a warning about Jejune's insidious motives and flees the building. Following instructions from the so-named Commander 14 of the Elsewhere Society, Peter escapes the Institute and is sent an address. The information leads Peter to a shop in an alley where he meets Simone, and the two work together to find clues and solve the Society's puzzles. The experience improves Peter's outlook on life, but the feeling quickly fades away, only returning after receiving another Elsewhere Society mission.\n\nPeter's next task leads him to a gathering of other participants in the Society's games. Those present are assigned groups of four, where Peter is reunited with Simone and meets Fredwynn and Janice. The group is told to find Clara, Keeper of \"Divine Nonchalance\". They go to a diner to discuss the nature of the game, with Janice believing the game is a prank, Simone guessing it's a marketing stunt, and Fredwynn insisting that the whole thing is a high-level conspiracy. When pressed, Peter suggests that the game is real. Noticing the time, Simone leaves the diner but is accosted by two men outside.

The two take the fish, which introduces itself as Clara, to [[Fishtown, Philadelphia|Fishtown]]. They follow the clues and eventually are lead up to a roof, where \"Clara\" encourages them to reveal something scary to each other. Peter admits to Simone that he likes her, but Simone is unable to reciprocate, leaving Peter devastated. Simone meets Fredwynn and Janice at the diner, where they discover that each partnership was presented with contradictory information. They are given the choice of going to the Elsewhere Society's protest or the Jejune Institute's shareholders' meeting. Deciding to attend both, Simone sees Peter at the protest and apologizes, while Fredwynn sneaks into Octavio's limo as it leaves for the shareholders' meeting.\n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = Janice\n |DirectedBy = [[Michael Trim (television producer)|Michael Trim]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Jordan Harrison]] & Jason Segel\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|9}}\n |Viewers = 0.240<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-9-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.9.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 10, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = The story carries on from the perspective of Janice as she, Peter, and Simone chase down Octavio's limo. They follow the car to a theater, but Fredwynn is nowhere to be seen. Octavio finds them and takes them to the stage, where Janice is persuaded to join the audience of the shareholders' meeting. Janice volunteers to demonstrate \"The I.D.E.A\", an invention apparently created by Clara before her disappearance. The device takes Janice back to the day of her wedding, showing her a version of her younger self expressing disdain for Janice's lack of independence. Suddenly, Commander 14 and the Elsewhere Society protesters crash the meeting and scuffle with the audience. Janice leaves with Simone and Peter and find Fredwynn outside the theater, who insists that Jejune and the Elsewhere Society are the same and that the whole game is scripted, though the other three are unconvinced.

The next day, Janice, Simone, Fredwynn, and Peter meet in the diner. Fredwynn proposes that the game is a distraction run by powerful data moguls, and takes the other three to find out more. The others quickly get irritated by his suspicions and tell him to go home and wait for the next clue. Unable to sleep, he re-thinks his steps from the previous day and goes to ask Janice for help retrieving a clue from the wedding video. They enter her \"memory palace\" and decipher a hidden address.

The writing recounts Clara's life in Fishtown and the early days of the Elsewhere Society, originally made up of Clara and three friends. The Society worked to improve Fishtown and make it beautiful, garnering the attention of the Jejune Institute. The next day, Janice finds out Fredwynn hid urgent messages from her husband's nurse. Peter quits his job after being inspired by Clara's passion. Back at the house, the group resumes the story of Clara as she's being recruited by Octavio Coleman, Esq., who promised her vast resources and the power to change the world. She rejected Jejune's offer but disappeared soon after. After finishing the story, Simone shows Peter a 20 year-old photo of Clara's first mural, evidence that Clara and the events described in the game are real.\n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = Everyone\n |DirectedBy = [[Ariel Kleiman]]\n |WrittenBy = Eva Anderson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|30}}\n |Viewers = 0.228<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-30-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.30.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 31, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = At the diner, the group receives messages informing them \"the truth\" will be revealed that night.

Peter volunteers to help Fredwynn uncover his conspiracy, leaving Janice and Simone to look for clues about Clara on his behalf. Peter realizes his former employer's parent company is involved in the game. He and Fredwynn infiltrate his old office and identify an IP address through a playlist containing the songs they've heard on their missions. Meanwhile, Janice and Simone find an apartment with one of Clara's paintings and discover her full name on a lease from 1999, Clara Torres. Through newspaper records, they trace Clara's steps back to a former psychiatric hospital Janice had been admitted to in her past, now an apartment complex. Fredwynn and Peter meet them there, revealing the IP address location as the penthouse, and the four of them head up in the elevator. Inside the penthouse they find what looks to be a crime scene and a TV repeating messages from Octavio Coleman, esq. and Commander 14 both claiming the other has Clara.\n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Cave of Kelpius\n |DirectedBy = Marta Cunningham\n |WrittenBy = Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|6}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = A man drinking chocolate milk arrives at the penthouse, but flees after seeing the group. They chase him to the street and follow him into an underground tunnel. They discover a gathering of other players from both the Elsewhere Society and Jejune Institute factions. Each group starts demanding the other side hand over Clara, when suddenly, Octavio Coleman, Esq. and Commander 14 both appear. Commander 14 shows his real face, identical in appearance to Octavio, and they give everyone a new task: to work together. The group watches a video montage of their sleuthing from earlier that day, and realize that it was still just part of the game. Clara, Octavio, and Commander 14 reveal themselves as actors, devastating Peter. All the participants head over to the game's afterparty. Fredwynn searches for the architect of the game, while Simone and Peter agree to start a relationship. Feeling left out, Janice leaves the party and recognizes a woman as the architect. She asks the architect about the real Clara Torres. The architect tells her the real Clara is dead, and that it's all their fault. \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = Lee\n |RTitle = <ref>{{cite web |url=http://showcase.onthedemo.com/newyorkcity/en/program/17815571/1/EP034155480008 |title=Lee |website=[[Gracenote]] |accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy = \n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson & Bianca Ursillo|t=Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|13}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |Title = The Creator\n |RTitle = <ref>{{cite web |url=http://showcase.onthedemo.com/newyorkcity/en/program/17815571/1/EP034155480009 |title=The Creator |website=[[Gracenote]] |accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy = \n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Mark Friedman|t=Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n |Title = The Boy\n |RTitle = <ref>{{cite web |url=http://showcase.onthedemo.com/newyorkcity/en/program/17815571/1/EP034155480010 |title=The Boy |website=[[Gracenote]] |accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy = \n |WrittenBy = Jason Segel\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|27}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series has an 83% rating with an average score of 7.15 out of 10 based on 30 reviews.

One day, he encounters a series of mysterious flyers on his route to work. Intrigued, he decides to take a tag and calls the number, after which he's invited to the Jejune Institute for an induction ceremony. After arriving, Peter receives a warning about Jejune's insidious motives and flees the building. Following instructions from the so-named Commander 14 of the Elsewhere Society, Peter escapes the Institute and is sent an address. The information leads Peter to a shop in an alley where he meets Simone, and the two work together to find clues and solve the Society's puzzles. The experience improves Peter's outlook on life, but the feeling quickly fades away, only returning after receiving another Elsewhere Society mission.\n\nPeter's next task leads him to a gathering of other participants in the Society's games. Those present are assigned groups of four, where Peter is reunited with Simone and meets Fredwynn and Janice. The group is told to find Clara, Keeper of \"Divine Nonchalance\". They go to a diner to discuss the nature of the game, with Janice believing the game is a prank, Simone guessing it's a marketing stunt, and Fredwynn insisting that the whole thing is a high-level conspiracy. When pressed, Peter suggests that the game is real. Noticing the time, Simone leaves the diner but is accosted by two men outside.

The two take the fish, which introduces itself as Clara, to [[Fishtown, Philadelphia|Fishtown]]. They follow the clues and eventually are lead up to a roof, where \"Clara\" encourages them to reveal something scary to each other. Peter admits to Simone that he likes her, but Simone is unable to reciprocate, leaving Peter devastated. Simone meets Fredwynn and Janice at the diner, where they discover that each partnership was presented with contradictory information. They are given the choice of going to the Elsewhere Society's protest or the Jejune Institute's shareholders' meeting.

Janice volunteers to demonstrate \"The I.D.E.A\", an invention apparently created by Clara before her disappearance. The device takes Janice back to the day of her wedding, showing her a version of her younger self expressing disdain for Janice's lack of independence. Suddenly, Commander 14 and the Elsewhere Society protesters crash the meeting and scuffle with the audience. Janice leaves with Simone and Peter and find Fredwynn outside the theater, who insists that Jejune and the Elsewhere Society are the same and that the whole game is scripted, though the other three are unconvinced.

The next day, Janice, Simone, Fredwynn, and Peter meet in the diner. Fredwynn proposes that the game is a distraction run by powerful data moguls, and takes the other three to find out more. The others quickly get irritated by his suspicions and tell him to go home and wait for the next clue. Unable to sleep, he re-thinks his steps from the previous day and goes to ask Janice for help retrieving a clue from the wedding video. They enter her \"memory palace\" and decipher a hidden address.

The writing recounts Clara's life in Fishtown and the early days of the Elsewhere Society, originally made up of Clara and three friends. The Society worked to improve Fishtown and make it beautiful, garnering the attention of the Jejune Institute. The next day, Janice finds out Fredwynn hid urgent messages from her husband's nurse. Peter quits his job after being inspired by Clara's passion. Back at the house, the group resumes the story of Clara as she's being recruited by Octavio Coleman, Esq., who promised her vast resources and the power to change the world. She rejected Jejune's offer but disappeared soon after.

Peter volunteers to help Fredwynn uncover his conspiracy, leaving Janice and Simone to look for clues about Clara on his behalf. Peter realizes his former employer's parent company is involved in the game. He and Fredwynn infiltrate his old office and identify an IP address through a playlist containing the songs they've heard on their missions. Meanwhile, Janice and Simone find an apartment with one of Clara's paintings and discover her full name on a lease from 1999, Clara Torres. Through newspaper records, they trace Clara's steps back to a former psychiatric hospital Janice had been admitted to in her past, now an apartment complex. Fredwynn and Peter meet them there, revealing the IP address location as the penthouse, and the four of them head up in the elevator. Inside the penthouse they find what looks to be a crime scene and a TV repeating messages from Octavio Coleman, esq. and Commander 14 both claiming the other has Clara.\n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Cave of Kelpius\n |DirectedBy = Marta Cunningham\n |WrittenBy = Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|6}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = A man drinking chocolate milk arrives at the penthouse, but flees after seeing the group. They chase him to the street and follow him into an underground tunnel. They discover a gathering of other players from both the Elsewhere Society and Jejune Institute factions. Each group starts demanding the other side hand over Clara, when suddenly, Octavio Coleman, esq. and Commander 14 both appear. Commander 14 shows his real face, identical in appearance to Octavio, and they give everyone a new task: to work together. The group watches a video montage of their sleuthing from earlier that day, and realize that it was still just part of the game. Clara, Octavio, and Commander 14 reveal themselves as actors, devastating Peter. All the participants head over to the game's afterparty. Fredwynn searches for the architect of the game, while Simone and Peter agree to start a relationship. Feeling left out, Janice leaves the party and recognizes a woman as the architect. She asks the architect about the real Clara Torres. The architect tells her the real Clara is dead, and that it's all their fault. \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = Lee\n |RTitle = <ref>{{cite web |url=http://showcase.onthedemo.com/newyorkcity/en/program/17815571/1/EP034155480008 |title=Lee |website=[[Gracenote]] |accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy = \n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson & Bianca Ursillo|t=Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|13}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |Title = The Creator\n |RTitle = <ref>{{cite web |url=http://showcase.onthedemo.com/newyorkcity/en/program/17815571/1/EP034155480009 |title=The Creator |website=[[Gracenote]] |accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy = \n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Mark Friedman|t=Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n |Title = The Boy\n |RTitle = <ref>{{cite web |url=http://showcase.onthedemo.com/newyorkcity/en/program/17815571/1/EP034155480010 |title=The Boy |website=[[Gracenote]] |accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy = \n |WrittenBy = Jason Segel\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|27}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series has an 83% rating with an average score of 7.15 out of 10 based on 30 reviews.

Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally had only two powerhouses. The third powerhouse, completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the [[United States]] by [[Nameplate capacity|nameplate-capacity]] at 6,809 MW.<ref>{{cite web | title = Renewable Energy Sources: A Consumer's Guide | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy: Energy Information Administration | url = http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/brochure/renew05/renewable.html#tab2 | accessdate = January 28, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100526125352/http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/brochure/renew05/renewable.html#tab2 | archive-date = May 26, 2010 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe proposal to build the dam was the focus of a bitter debate during the 1920s between two groups. One group wanted to irrigate the ancient [[Grand Coulee]] with a gravity canal while the other pursued a high dam and pumping scheme. The dam supporters won in 1933, but for fiscal reasons the initial design was for a \"low dam\" {{Convert|290|ft|m|0}} tall which would generate electricity without supporting irrigation. That year, the [[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]] and a consortium of three companies called MWAK (Mason-Walsh-Atkinson Kier Company) began construction. After visiting the construction site in August 1934, President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] endorsed the \"high dam\" design which, at {{cvt|550|ft|m|0}} high, would provide enough electricity to pump water into the Columbia basin for irrigation. [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] approved the high dam in 1935 and it was completed in 1942. The first waters overtopped Grand Coulee's spillway on {{nobr|June 1}} of that year.\n\nPower from the dam fueled the growing industries of the Northwest United States during [[World War&nbsp;II]]. Between 1967 and 1974, the third powerplant was constructed. The decision to construct the additional facility was influenced by growing energy demand, regulated river flows stipulated in the [[Columbia River Treaty]] with Canada, and competition with the [[Soviet Union]]. Through a series of upgrades and the installation of [[pumped-storage|pump-generators]], the dam now supplies four power stations with an installed capacity of 6,809&nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]]. As the centerpiece of the [[Columbia Basin Project]], the dam's reservoir supplies water for the irrigation of {{cvt|671,000|acre|km2|-2}}.\n\nThe [[reservoir]] is called [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake|Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake]], named after the United States President who presided over the dam's authorization and completion. Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3,000 people, including [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s whose ancestral lands were partially flooded. While the dam does not contain fish passage, neither does the next downstream dam, [[Chief Joseph Dam]]. This means no salmon reach the Grand Coulee Dam. The third large dam downstream, [[Wells Dam]], has an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning and migration.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Grand Coulee]] is an ancient river bed on the [[Columbia Plateau]] created during the [[Pliocene]] Epoch (Calabrian) by retreating glaciers and floods. Originally, geologists believed a glacier that diverted the Columbia River formed the Grand Coulee, but it was revealed in the mid-late 20th century that massive floods from [[Lake Missoula]] carved most of the gorge.<ref name=\"Pitzer2\">{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|pp=2\u20135.}}</ref> The earliest known proposal to irrigate the Grand Coulee with the Columbia River dates to 1892, when the ''Coulee City News'' and ''The Spokesman Review'' reported on a scheme by a man named Laughlin McLean to construct a {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} dam across the Columbia River, high enough that water would back up into the Grand Coulee. A dam that size would have its reservoir encroach into Canada, which would violate treaties.<ref name=\"coulee pic7\">{{harvnb|Bottenberg|2008|p=7.}}</ref>  Soon after the Bureau of Reclamation was founded, it investigated a scheme for pumping water from the Columbia River to irrigate parts of central Washington. An attempt to raise funds for irrigation failed in 1914, as Washington voters rejected a bond measure.<ref name=\"bil192\">{{harvnb|Bilington|Jackson|Melosi|2005|p=192.}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|quote = Such a power if developed would operate railroads, factories, mines, irrigation pumps, furnish heat and light in such measure that all in all it would be the most unique, the most interesting, and the most remarkable development of both irrigation and power in this age of industrial and scientific miracles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Coulee: Harnessing a Dream (book excerpt)|url=http://content.lib.washington.edu/grandcouleeweb/book-excerpt.html#7|publisher=University of Washington Libraries|accessdate=11 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117061631/http://content.lib.washington.edu/grandcouleeweb/book-excerpt.html#7|archive-date=17 January 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|source = \u2013 Rufus Woods\n|qalign = left |align = left |width = 24em |salign = right\n}}\n\nIn 1917, William M. Clapp, a lawyer from [[Ephrata, Washington]], proposed the Columbia be dammed immediately below the Grand Coulee.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|p=10.}}</ref> He suggested a concrete dam could flood the plateau, just as nature blocked it with ice centuries ago. Clapp was joined by James O'Sullivan, another lawyer, and by Rufus Woods, publisher of ''[[The Wenatchee World]]'' newspaper in the nearby agricultural centre of [[Wenatchee, Washington|Wenatchee]]. Together, they became known as the \"Dam College\".<ref name=\"OrtCusha6\">{{harvnb|Ortolano|Cushing|2000|p=A6.}}</ref> Woods began promoting the Grand Coulee Dam in his newspaper, often with articles written by O'Sullivan.\n\nThe dam idea gained popularity with the public in 1918. Backers of reclamation in Central Washington split into two camps. The \"pumpers\" favored a dam with pumps to elevate water from the river into the Grand Coulee from which canals and pipes could irrigate farmland. The \"ditchers\" favored diverting water from northeast Washington's [[Pend Oreille River]] via a gravity canal to irrigate farmland in Central and Eastern Washington. Many locals such as Woods, O'Sullivan and Clapp were pumpers, while many influential businessmen in Spokane associated with the [[Washington Water and Power Company]] (WWPC) were staunch ditchers. The pumpers argued that hydroelectricity from the dam could cover costs and claimed the ditchers sought to maintain a monopoly on electric power.<ref name=\"coulee pic7\" />\n\nThe ditchers took several steps to ensure support for their proposals. In 1921, WWPC secured a preliminary permit to build a dam at [[Kettle Falls]], about {{convert|110|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} upstream from the Grand Coulee. If built, the Kettle Falls Dam would have lain in the path of the Grand Coulee Dam's reservoir, essentially blocking its construction.<ref name=\"pitzer2933\">{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|pp=29\u201333.}}</ref>  WWPC planted rumors in the newspapers, stating exploratory drilling at the Grand Coulee site found no granite on which a dam's foundations could rest, only clay and fragmented rock. This was later disproved with Reclamation-ordered drilling. Ditchers hired General [[George W. Goethals]], engineer of the [[Panama Canal]], to prepare a report. Goethals visited the state and produced a report backing the ditchers. The Bureau of Reclamation was unimpressed by Goethals' report, believing it filled with errors.<ref name=\"pitzer2933\" />  In {{Nowrap|July 1923}}, President [[Warren G. Harding]] visited Washington state and expressed support for irrigation work there, but died a month later. His successor, [[Calvin Coolidge]], had little interest in irrigation projects. The Bureau of Reclamation, desirous of a major project that would bolster its reputation, was focusing on the [[Boulder Canyon Project]] that resulted in the [[Hoover Dam]]. Reclamation was authorized to conduct a study in 1923, but the project's cost made federal officials reluctant. The Washington state proposals received little support from those further east, who feared the irrigation would result in more crops, depressing prices.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|pp=41\u201342.}}</ref> With President Coolidge opposed to the project, bills to appropriate money for surveys of the Grand Coulee site failed.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|p=45.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FutureGrandCouleeDamSite.jpg|thumb|The dam site before construction, looking south]]\nIn 1925, Congress authorized a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] study of the Columbia River.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|p=43.}}</ref> This study was included in the Rivers and Harbors Act of {{Nowrap|March 1925}}, which provided for studies on the navigation, power, flood control and irrigation potential of rivers.

In {{Nowrap|February 1936}}, MWAK had begun constructing cofferdams above and below the channel between the east and west cofferdams. By December, the entire Columbia River was diverted over the foundations constructed within the east and west cofferdams. On {{Nowrap|December 15}}, 1936, the ''Wenatchee Daily World'' announced the river was diverted and by early the next year, people were arriving in large numbers to see the riverbed.<ref>{{harvnb|Bilington|Jackson|Melosi|2005|p=218.}}</ref>\n\n===Design change===\n[[File:Grand Coulee Dam construction.jpg|left|thumb|Base of the dam in 1938]]\nOn August 4, 1934, President [[Franklin D.

In 1943, Congress authorized the [[Columbia Basin Project]] and the Bureau of Reclamation began construction of irrigation facilities in 1948. Directly to the west and above the Grand Coulee Dam, the [[North Dam]] was constructed. This dam, along with the [[Dry Falls Dam]] to the south, enclosed and created [[Banks Lake]], which covered the northern {{convert|27|mi|km|abbr=on}} of the [[Grand Coulee]]. Additional dams, such as the Pinto and [[O'Sullivan Dam]]s, were constructed alongside siphons and canals, creating a vast irrigation supply network called the Columbia Basin Project.

Dam''' is a concrete [[gravity dam]] on the [[Columbia River]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], built to produce [[hydroelectric]] power and provide irrigation water. Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally had only two powerhouses. The third powerhouse, completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the [[United States]] by [[Nameplate capacity|nameplate-capacity]] at 6,809 MW.<ref>{{cite web | title = Renewable Energy Sources: A Consumer's Guide | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy: Energy Information Administration | url = http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/brochure/renew05/renewable.html#tab2 | accessdate = January 28, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100526125352/http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/brochure/renew05/renewable.html#tab2 | archive-date = May 26, 2010 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe proposal to build the dam was the focus of a bitter debate during the 1920s between two groups. One group wanted to irrigate the ancient [[Grand Coulee]] with a gravity canal while the other pursued a high dam and pumping scheme. The dam supporters won in 1933, but for fiscal reasons the initial design was for a \"low dam\" {{Convert|290|ft|m|0}} tall which would generate electricity without supporting irrigation. That year, the [[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]] and a consortium of three companies called MWAK (Mason-Walsh-Atkinson Kier Company) began construction. After visiting the construction site in August 1934, President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] endorsed the \"high dam\" design which, at {{cvt|550|ft|m|0}} high, would provide enough electricity to pump water into the Columbia basin for irrigation. [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] approved the high dam in 1935 and it was completed in 1942. The first waters overtopped Grand Coulee's spillway on {{nobr|June 1}} of that year.\n\nPower from the dam fueled the growing industries of the Northwest United States during [[World War&nbsp;II]]. Between 1967 and 1974, the third powerplant was constructed. The decision to construct the additional facility was influenced by growing energy demand, regulated river flows stipulated in the [[Columbia River Treaty]] with Canada, and competition with the [[Soviet Union]]. Through a series of upgrades and the installation of [[pumped-storage|pump-generators]], the dam now supplies four power stations with an installed capacity of 6,809&nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]]. As the centerpiece of the [[Columbia Basin Project]], the dam's reservoir supplies water for the irrigation of {{cvt|671,000|acre|km2|-2}}.\n\nThe [[reservoir]] is called [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake|Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake]], named after the United States President who presided over the dam's authorization and completion. Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3,000 people, including [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s whose ancestral lands were partially flooded. While the dam does not contain fish passage, neither does the next downstream dam, [[Chief Joseph Dam]]. This means no salmon reach the Grand Coulee Dam. The third large dam downstream, [[Wells Dam]], has an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning and migration.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Grand Coulee]] is an ancient river bed on the [[Columbia Plateau]] created during the [[Pliocene]] Epoch (Calabrian) by retreating glaciers and floods. Originally, geologists believed a glacier that diverted the Columbia River formed the Grand Coulee, but it was revealed in the mid-late 20th century that massive floods from [[Lake Missoula]] carved most of the gorge.<ref name=\"Pitzer2\">{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|pp=2\u20135.}}</ref> The earliest known proposal to irrigate the Grand Coulee with the Columbia River dates to 1892, when the ''Coulee City News'' and ''The Spokesman Review'' reported on a scheme by a man named Laughlin McLean to construct a {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} dam across the Columbia River, high enough that water would back up into the Grand Coulee. A dam that size would have its reservoir encroach into Canada, which would violate treaties.<ref name=\"coulee pic7\">{{harvnb|Bottenberg|2008|p=7.}}</ref>  Soon after the Bureau of Reclamation was founded, it investigated a scheme for pumping water from the Columbia River to irrigate parts of central Washington. An attempt to raise funds for irrigation failed in 1914, as Washington voters rejected a bond measure.<ref name=\"bil192\">{{harvnb|Bilington|Jackson|Melosi|2005|p=192.}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|quote = Such a power if developed would operate railroads, factories, mines, irrigation pumps, furnish heat and light in such measure that all in all it would be the most unique, the most interesting, and the most remarkable development of both irrigation and power in this age of industrial and scientific miracles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Coulee: Harnessing a Dream (book excerpt)|url=http://content.lib.washington.edu/grandcouleeweb/book-excerpt.html#7|publisher=University of Washington Libraries|accessdate=11 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117061631/http://content.lib.washington.edu/grandcouleeweb/book-excerpt.html#7|archive-date=17 January 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|source = \u2013 Rufus Woods\n|qalign = left |align = left |width = 24em |salign = right\n}}\n\nIn 1917, William M. Clapp, a lawyer from [[Ephrata, Washington]], proposed the Columbia be dammed immediately below the Grand Coulee.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|p=10.}}</ref> He suggested a concrete dam could flood the plateau, just as nature blocked it with ice centuries ago. Clapp was joined by James O'Sullivan, another lawyer, and by Rufus Woods, publisher of ''[[The Wenatchee World]]'' newspaper in the nearby agricultural centre of [[Wenatchee, Washington|Wenatchee]]. Together, they became known as the \"Dam College\".<ref name=\"OrtCusha6\">{{harvnb|Ortolano|Cushing|2000|p=A6.}}</ref> Woods began promoting the Grand Coulee Dam in his newspaper, often with articles written by O'Sullivan.\n\nThe dam idea gained popularity with the public in 1918. Backers of reclamation in Central Washington split into two camps. The \"pumpers\" favored a dam with pumps to elevate water from the river into the Grand Coulee from which canals and pipes could irrigate farmland. The \"ditchers\" favored diverting water from northeast Washington's [[Pend Oreille River]] via a gravity canal to irrigate farmland in Central and Eastern Washington. Many locals such as Woods, O'Sullivan and Clapp were pumpers, while many influential businessmen in Spokane associated with the [[Washington Water and Power Company]] (WWPC) were staunch ditchers. The pumpers argued that hydroelectricity from the dam could cover costs and claimed the ditchers sought to maintain a monopoly on electric power.<ref name=\"coulee pic7\" />\n\nThe ditchers took several steps to ensure support for their proposals. In 1921, WWPC secured a preliminary permit to build a dam at [[Kettle Falls]], about {{convert|110|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} upstream from the Grand Coulee. If built, the Kettle Falls Dam would have lain in the path of the Grand Coulee Dam's reservoir, essentially blocking its construction.<ref name=\"pitzer2933\">{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|pp=29\u201333.}}</ref>  WWPC planted rumors in the newspapers, stating exploratory drilling at the Grand Coulee site found no granite on which a dam's foundations could rest, only clay and fragmented rock. This was later disproved with Reclamation-ordered drilling. Ditchers hired General [[George W. Goethals]], engineer of the [[Panama Canal]], to prepare a report. Goethals visited the state and produced a report backing the ditchers. The Bureau of Reclamation was unimpressed by Goethals' report, believing it filled with errors.<ref name=\"pitzer2933\" />  In {{Nowrap|July 1923}}, President [[Warren G. Harding]] visited Washington state and expressed support for irrigation work there, but died a month later. His successor, [[Calvin Coolidge]], had little interest in irrigation projects. The Bureau of Reclamation, desirous of a major project that would bolster its reputation, was focusing on the [[Boulder Canyon Project]] that resulted in the [[Hoover Dam]]. Reclamation was authorized to conduct a study in 1923, but the project's cost made federal officials reluctant. The Washington state proposals received little support from those further east, who feared the irrigation would result in more crops, depressing prices.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|pp=41\u201342.}}</ref> With President Coolidge opposed to the project, bills to appropriate money for surveys of the Grand Coulee site failed.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|p=45.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FutureGrandCouleeDamSite.jpg|thumb|The dam site before construction, looking south]]\nIn 1925, Congress authorized a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] study of the Columbia River.<ref>{{harvnb|Pitzer|1994|p=43.}}</ref> This study was included in the Rivers and Harbors Act of {{Nowrap|March 1925}}, which provided for studies on the navigation, power, flood control and irrigation potential of rivers.

Contracts for companies to construct the various parts of the dam were difficult to award as few companies were sizable enough to fill them. This forced companies to consolidate. In addition, Native American graves had to be relocated and temporary [[fish ladder]]s had to be constructed. During construction additional problems included landslides and the need to protect newly poured concrete from freezing.<ref name=\"coulee pic8\"/> Construction on the downstream [[Grand Coulee Bridge]] began in {{Nowrap|May 1934}} and more considerable earth-moving began in August.

The west cofferdam was {{Convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, {{Convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick and was constructed {{Convert|110|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the bedrock.<ref>{{harvnb|Downs|1993|p=177.}}</ref> The cofferdams allowed workers to dry portions of the riverbed and begin constructing the dam, while water continued to flow down the center of the riverbed.<ref name=\"washing11\">{{harvnb|State of Washington|1947|p=11.}}</ref> In {{Nowrap|August 1936}}, once the west foundation was complete, portions of the west cofferdam were dismantled, allowing water to flow through part of the dam's new foundation. In {{Nowrap|February 1936}}, MWAK had begun constructing cofferdams above and below the channel between the east and west cofferdams. By December, the entire Columbia River was diverted over the foundations constructed within the east and west cofferdams. On {{Nowrap|December 15}}, 1936, the ''Wenatchee Daily World'' announced the river was diverted and by early the next year, people were arriving in large numbers to see the riverbed.<ref>{{harvnb|Bilington|Jackson|Melosi|2005|p=218.}}</ref>\n\n===Design change===\n[[File:Grand Coulee Dam construction.jpg|left|thumb|Base of the dam in 1938]]\nOn August 4, 1934, President [[Franklin D.

This dam, along with the [[Dry Falls Dam]] to the south, enclosed and created [[Banks Lake]], which covered the northern {{convert|27|mi|km|abbr=on}} of the [[Grand Coulee]]. Additional dams, such as the Pinto and [[O'Sullivan Dam]]s, were constructed alongside siphons and canals, creating a vast irrigation supply network called the Columbia Basin Project.
