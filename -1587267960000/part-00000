The city was frequented by many traders from the [[Middle East|Middle-East]], the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian Subcountinent]] and [[China]]. At the height of its power, the territory of the Srivijaya Empire reached modern-day [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Malaysia]]. After Srivijaya collapsed in the 14th century, small kingdoms began to establish itself in the province. Beginning in the 16th century, [[Islam]] began to [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|spread]] in the region, effectively replacing [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] as the dominant religion in the region. In the 17th century, the Islamic [[Palembang Sultanate]] was established with Palembang as its capital. At that time, however, Europeans began arriving in the region, first the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and then the [[Dutch people|Dutch]]. The Dutch became the dominant power in the region. Through the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), the Dutch exerted influence on the Palembang Sultanate. In 1811, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the last Sultan of Palembang, Sultan [[Mahmud Badaruddin II]] attacked the Dutch in Palembang, but he refused to cooperate with the British, so [[Stamford Raffles|Thomas Stamford Raffles]] sent troops to attack Palembang and Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II was forced to flee the royal palace, then Raffles appointed the Sultan Ahmad Najamuddin II, brother of Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II as king. In 1813 Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II again took over the kingdom, but one month later he was brought down again by Raffles and reappointed Sultan Ahmad Najamuddin II, causing a split in the Sultanate of Palembang.<ref name=\"Ricklefs140\">{{cite book|title=A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|page=140|authorlink=Merle Calvin Ricklefs}}</ref> After the Dutch returned to the region, the Dutch attacked and annexed the sultanate to the [[Dutch East Indies]], and exiled the sultan and his family to [[Ternate]]. The Dutch controlled the region for the next century, but during [[World War II]], the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Battle of Palembang|attacked Palembang]] and expelled the Dutch. The Japanese occupied the region until August 1945, when they surrendered to the Allied forces. The Dutch attempted to return to the region, but this was opposed by the newly-declared [[Republic Of Indonesia]], resulting in a [[Indonesian National Revolution|War of Independence]].

The Sundanese manuscript of [[Carita Parahyangan]] composed around the late 16th-century in West Java, mentioned vaguely about a princely hero that rose to be a king named [[Sanjaya of Mataram|Sanjaya]] that after secured his rule in Java \u2014 involved in battle with the Malayu and Keling, against their king named \"Sang Sri Wijaya\". The term [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] is a [[Javanese language|Javanese]]-[[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] term to refer [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]] of Sumatra, while [[Keling]] \u2014 derived from historical [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga kingdom]] of [[South India|Southern India,]] refer to people of Indian descent that inhabit the archipelago. Fascinatingly, the name Srivijaya still being found in this local manuscript, although was mistakenly refer to a king. Subsequently, after studying both local stone inscriptions, manuscripts and Chinese historical accounts, historians concluded that the term \"Srivijaya\" refer to a polity or a kingdom.\n\nSrivijaya is called by various names. The [[Chinese people|Chinese]] call it Shih-li-fo-shih or San-fo-ts'i or San Fo Qi. In [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali|Pali languages]], the Srivijaya kingdom was called ''Yavadesh'' and ''Javadeh,'' while the [[Arabs]] call it ''Zabaj,'' and the [[Khmer people]] called it ''Malayu''.{{sfn|Sucipto|2009|p=30}} The number of names is another reason why Srivijaya is very difficult to find.

Abu Zaid wrote that the kingdom of ''Zabaj'' (another Arabic name for Srivijaya) had fertile land and extensive power to the other side of the sea.{{Sfn|Sucipto|2009|p=30}}\n\nSrivijaya controlled the maritime trade route in Southeast Asia throughout the 10th century, but at the end of the century the [[Medang Kingdom|Kingdom of Medang]] in [[East Java]] grew into a new maritime force and began to challenge the dominance of Srivijaya. The Chinese news from the [[Song dynasty|Song Dynasty]] called the Srivijaya Kingdom in Sumatra the name ''San-fo-tsi'', while the Kingdom of Medang in Java by the name ''She-po''. It is said that ''San-fo-tsi'' and ''She-po'' were involved in competition for control of Southeast Asia. Both countries sent ambassadors to each other to China. The ''San-fo-tsi'' ambassador who departed in 988 was held in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] when he was about to go home, because his country was attacked by Javanese troops. This attack from Java allegedly took place around the 990s, namely between 988 and 992 during the reign of Sri [[Cudamani Warmadewa]].{{sfn|Munoz|2006|p=150}}\n[[File:Talang Tuo Inscription.jpg|thumb|The [[Talang Tuo inscription|''Talang Tuo'' inscription]] dating from the 7th century AD]]\nThe kingdom of Medang succeeded in capturing [[Palembang]] in 992 for a while, but later the Medang forces were successfully repelled by Sriwijaya forces. The ''Hujung Langit'' inscription of 997 again mentions a Javanese attack on Sumatra. This series of attacks from Java ultimately failed because Java failed to establish a foothold in Sumatra. Capturing the capital city in Palembang is not enough because the Sriwijaya power are spread in several port cities in the [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] region. The Srivijaya emperor, Sri [[Cudamani Warmadewa]], escaped out of the capital and traveled around gathering strength and reinforcements from his allies and subordinate kings to repel the Javanese army. The empire managed to survived and succeeded in repelling the Javanese navy.\n\nIn 1025, the empire was defeated by the [[Chola dynasty|Chola Empire]] (during the period of Emperor [[Rajendra Chola]] I) of southern [[India]].<ref>Early kingdoms of the Indonesian archipelago and the Malay Peninsula by Paul Michel Munoz p.161</ref><ref>Cengage Advantage Books: The Earth and Its Peoples by Richard Bulliet, Pamela Crossley, Daniel Headrick, Steven Hirsch, Lyman Johnson p.182</ref> The Chola Empire had conquered the Sriwijaya colonies, such as the [[Nicobar Islands]] region and at the same time succeeded in capturing the ruling Srivijaya king at that time [[Sangrama Vijayatunggavarman]]. During the following decades, the entire Srivijaya empire was under the influence of the Chola dynasty. Nonetheless, Rajendra Chola I still gave the opportunity to the kings he conquered to remain in power while remaining submissive to him.<ref>Sastri K. A. N., (1935). ''The Cholas''. University of Madras.</ref> Srivijaya's capital eventually moved northward to Jambi. This can be attributed to the news of the ''San-fo-ts'i'' delegation to China in 1028. Another factor in Sriwijaya's decline was natural factors. Because of the sedimentation of mud on the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]] and several other tributaries, the merchant ships arriving in Palembang diminished.{{sfn|Sucipto|2009|p=29}} As a result, the city of Palembang is getting away from the sea and not being strategic.

It says that the people in Java followed two kinds of religions, namely [[Buddhism]] and the religion of [[Brahmins]] ([[Hinduism]]), while the people of Srivijaya followed [[Buddhism]]. The book describes the people of Java as being brave, short-tempered and willing to fight. It also notes that their favourite pastimes were [[cockfighting]] and pig fighting. The coin used as the currency then were made from a mixture of [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[tin]].\n\nSrivijaya remained a formidable sea power until the 13th century.<ref name=\"end\" /> According to C\u0153d\u00e8s, at the end of the 13th century, the empire \"had ceased to exist... caused by the simultaneous pressure on its two flanks of Siam and Java.\"<ref name=\"C\u0153d\u00e8s\">{{cite journal|last=C\u0153d\u00e8s |first=George |authorlink=George C\u0153d\u00e8s |year=1918 |title=Le Royaume de \u00c7riwijaya |journal=Bulletin de l'\u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1\u201336}}</ref>{{rp|204,243}} However, there was virtually a power vacuum in the region since there was no prominent power to hold the region except for the waning [[Majapahit Empire]], itself centered in [[Java]] island. The vacuum allowed pirates to flourish in the region.\n\nAfter being conquered by Majapahit in 1375 AD, the Palembang region was made as one of the vassal or occupied territories of the Majapahit Empire, under the leadership of [[Hayam Wuruk]]. The government in Palembang was handed over to a regent who was appointed directly by Majapahit. However, internal problems in the Majapahit Empire made their attention to the conquered territories not very good. Even the Palembang region was controlled by traders from China. Until finally Majapahit regained control of Palembang after sending a commander named Arya Damar.\n\n===Palembang Sultanate===\n{{Main|Palembang Sultanate}}\n[[File:Mahmud Badaruddin II.jpg|thumb|236x236px|Sultan [[Mahmud Badaruddin II]] of Palembang led a revolt against the Dutch in the 19th century. Ultimately, he was defeated and exiled to [[the Moluccas]]. Today he is commemorated as the [[National Hero of Indonesia|national hero of Indonesia]].]]\nBy the late 15th century, [[Islam]] has spread throughout the region, replacing [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] as the dominant religion. Around the early 16th century, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], an adventurer from [[Portugal]], said that Palembang had been led by an appointed ''[[Vicegerent|patih]]'' (regent) from Java who was later referred to the [[Demak Sultanate]] and participated in attacking [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], which at that time had been controlled by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]]. In 1659, Sri Susuhunan Abdurrahman proclaimed the establishment of the [[Palembang Sultanate]]. The Sultanate of Palembang stood for almost two centuries, namely from 1659 to 1825. Sultan Ratu Abdurrahman Kholifatul Mukminin Sayidul Iman, or Sunan Cinde Walang, was the first king in the Sultanate of Palembang.\n\nThe reign of Sultan Muhammad Bahauddin (1776\u20131803) was also known as the golden era of the Palembang Sultanate which was quite successful. In his time, the sultanate's economy increased sharply because the sultan had mastered the techniques of how to trade well, including trading with VOCs. In fact, the VOC was upset with Sultan Bahauddin's trade monopoly which caused his contracts to be rejected often. As it turned out, Sultan Bahauddin preferred to trade with [[British Empire|Britain]], [[Qing dynasty|China]] and [[Malay People|Malay people]] in [[Riau]]. The impact of such a policy actually generates enormous wealth for the empire's wealth. Thus, the prosperity of the Sultanate of Palembang sharply increased. The Palembang Sultanate was strategically located in conducting trade relations, especially the results of spices with outside parties. The Palembang Sultanate also ruled over the [[Bangka Belitung Islands|Bangka-Belitung islands]] which had a tin mine and had been traded since the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|page=139|authorlink=Merle Calvin Ricklefs}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[Dutch East India Company]] increased its influence in the region, the Sultanate started to decline and losing its power. During [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1812, the sultan at that time, [[Mahmud Badaruddin II]] repudiated British claims to suzerainty. The British, under [[Stamford Raffles]] responded by attacking Palembang, sacking the court, and installing sultan's more cooperative younger brother, Najamuddin to the throne. The Dutch attempted to recover their influence at the court in 1816, but Sultan Najamuddin was uncooperative with them. An expedition launched by the Dutch in 1818 and captured Sultan Najamudin and exiled him to Batavia. A Dutch garrison was established in 1821, but sultan attempted an attack and a mass poisoning to the garrison, which were intervened by Dutch. Mahmud Badaruddin II was exiled to [[Ternate]], and his palace was burned to the ground. The Sultanate was later abolished by Dutch and direct colonial rule was established.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul E.|location=New York|page=663|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert M.}}</ref>\n\n===Dutch colonial rule===\n{{expand section|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Japanese occupation and independence===\nSouthern Sumatra was occupied by the Japanese in January 15, 1942 after the [[Battle of Palembang]] in [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/palembang.html|title=The Battle for Palembang |website=dutcheastindies.webs.com |access-date=22 March 2019}}</ref> After the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]], South Sumatra became a part of Sumatra Province as a [[Residency (country subdivision)|residency]] with [[Adnan Kapau Gani]] as the resident. On January 1, 1947, the Dutch tried to gain its sovereignty over South Sumatra by invading Palembang. Since then, fighting ensued across South Sumatra until Indonesia's independence was recognized by the Dutch on December 27, 1949. The area occupied by the Netherlands in South Sumatra was incorporated into [[South Sumatra State]] under the [[United States of Indonesia]] until the disbandment of the union and the founding of the republic. On September 12, 1950, South Sumatra province was established with a territory much larger than it is today, as it encompassed several provinces that were eventually given autonomy: [[Lampung]] was carved from the southern part of the province in 1964, [[Bengkulu]] from the coastal western part of the province in 1967, and [[Bangka-Belitung Islands|Bangka Belitung]] from the titular islands on December 4, 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irsansingomataram.blogspot.com/2012/07/normal-0-false-false-false-en-us-x-none.html|title=Irsan Singo Mataram: Sejarah Sumatera Selatan|first=Bunga Mayang Tiuh|last=Kita|date=|website=irsansingomataram.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSouth Sumatra has an area of {{convert|99888.28|km2}} and is located on the island of [[Sumatra]], western [[Indonesia]] which lies south of the equator at 10\u201340 degrees south and 102\u2013108 degrees east. The province is bordered by [[Jambi]] to the north, [[Lampung]] to the south and [[Bengkulu]] to the west, while in the east the [[Bangka Strait]] separates the province and the island-province of [[Bangka Belitung Islands]].\n\nOn the east coast the land consists of swamps and brackets which are affected by tides. Its vegetation is in the form of palmate plants and [[mangrove]]. A little more western is a vast lowland. Far to the west near the border of [[Bengkulu]] and [[Jambi]] lies the [[Barisan Mountains|Bukit Barisan mountains]], which divides South Sumatra and is a mountainous area with an altitude of 900\u20131,200 meters above sea level. Barisan Hill consists of the summit of Mount Seminung (1,964 m asl), [[Mount Dempo]] (3,159 m asl), [[Mount Patah]] (1,107 m asl), and Mount Bungkuk (2,125 m asl). To the west of Bukit Barisan is a slope. In the Bukit Barisan valley there are areas of rubber, oil palm, and agriculture plantations, especially coffee, tea and vegetables. Mount Dempo is the highest point in the province.\n\nSouth Sumatra has large rivers that can be navigated, but currently, because of the silting process, it cannot be navigated by large ships. Most of the rivers have flows from the Bukit Barisan mountains, except the [[Mesuji River|Mesuji]], Lalan and [[Banyuasin River|Banyuasin]] River. Much of water from South Sumatra section of Bukit Barisan mountains flows eastwards into [[Bangka Strait]] as [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]], with [[Ogan River|Ogan]], Komering, Lematang, Kelingi, Lakitan, Rupit River and [[Rawas River|Rawas]] River are its major tributaries. A few rivers in South Sumatra flow westwards into [[Indian Ocean]], for example Manna River in Pagaralam and Tanjung Sakti.\n\nIn January 2020, two islands in South Sumatra, Betet Island and Gundul Island, were submerged as a result of [[Climate change in Indonesia|climate change]], and four other islands were close to being submerged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gili-lombok.com/sembilang-national-park.html|title=Sembilang National Park - South Sumatra Swamp Forest|last=|first=|date=2020|website=www.gili-lombok.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\nThis region has a [[Tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]] climate, similar to most other Indonesian provinces. Throughout the year the province is only affected by two seasons, namely the rainy season and the dry season. The air temperature varies from 24.7 to 32.9 degrees Celsius with air humidity levels ranging from 82% to 88%. The relative rainy season falls from October to April. Variation in rainfall ranges from 2,100&nbsp;mm to 3,264&nbsp;mm. December is the month with the most rainfall while the dry season usually starts in June to September.\n\nThe season in South Sumatra is similar to other regions in Indonesia, only known for two seasons, namely the dry season and the rainy season. From June to September wind flows from [[Australia]] and do not contain much water vapor, resulting in a dry season. Conversely in December to March many wind currents contain water vapor from [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] during the rainy season. Such conditions occur every half year after passing the transition period in between April - May and October - November.{{Weather box|location=Palembang|metric first=Yes|single line=yes\n<!-- -->|Jan high C=30.8|Feb high C=31.2|Mar high C=31.5|Apr high C=32.1|May high C=32.4|Jun high C=31.9|Jul high C=31.8|Aug high C=32.1|Sep high C=32.5|Oct high C=32.6|Nov high C=31.9|Dec high C=31.1\n<!-- -->|Jan mean C=26.8|Feb mean C=27.1|Mar mean C=27.2|Apr mean C=27.7|May mean C=28.0|Jun mean C=27.4|Jul mean C=27.0|Aug mean C=27.2|Sep mean C=27.5|Oct mean C=27.7|Nov mean C=27.4|Dec mean C=27.0\n<!-- -->|Jan low C=22.9|Feb low C=23.0|Mar low C=23.0|Apr low C=23.4|May low C=23.6|Jun low C=22.9|Jul low C=22.3|Aug low C=22.4|Sep low C=22.5|Oct low C=22.9|Nov low C=23.0|Dec low C=23.0\n<!-- -->|Jan precipitation mm=277|Feb precipitation mm=262|Mar precipitation mm=329|Apr precipitation mm=263|May precipitation mm=213|Jun precipitation mm=122|Jul precipitation mm=104|Aug precipitation mm=107|Sep precipitation mm=120|Oct precipitation mm=186|Nov precipitation mm=274|Dec precipitation mm=366\n<!-- -->|Jan sun=169|Feb sun=118|Mar sun=130|Apr sun=150|May sun=174|Jun sun=127|Jul sun=130|Aug sun=149|Sep sun=118|Oct sun=160|Nov sun=132|Dec sun=120\n<!-- -->|source 1=Climate-Data.org<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/764268/|title=Climate Palembang: Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table for Palembang - Climate-Data.org|author=|date=|work=climate-data.org}}</ref>|source 2=[[Deutscher Wetterdienst]]<ref>ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/multi_annual/sunshine_duration/1961_1990.txt</ref><ref>ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/help/stations_list_CLIMAT_data.txt</ref>|date=December 2010}}<br />\nAs in most other province of Indonesia, South Sumatra has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Af'') bordering on a tropical monsoon climate.

Forming the next largest group is the other [[Malayan languages|Malayan]]-speaking populations as well as the Komering, a distinct Malayo-Polynesian people related to the native Lampungese from neighboring [[Lampung]]. [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], and [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] also form minorities in the province.\n\n[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] are the majority in this province. They are also often called Palembang people. Palembang people are divided into two groups: ''Wong Jeroo'' is a descendant of nobility and is slightly lower than the courtiers from the past kingdom based in Palembang, and ''Wong Jabo'' is a commoner. An expert on the origin of Palembang people who are also descendants of the king, admitted that the Palembang people was the descendant of [[Arabs]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and other [[ethnic groups in Indonesia]]. Palembang people itself has two different languages, namely ''Baso Palembang Alus'' and ''Baso Palembang Sari-Sari''. The Palembang people still lives in a house built on water. The architectural model of the Palembang house which is most typical is the ''[[rumah limas]]'' which is mostly erected on stilts on the water to protect from flooding that continues to occur until now. In the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi river]] area, Palembang people often offer their wares on boats.\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Drie ongehuwde jonge vrouwen uit Komering TMnr 10005250.jpg|thumb|Three Komering girls in 1929]]\nKomering is one of the tribes or cultural regions in South Sumatra, which is along the [[Komering River]]. Like other ethnic groupsin South Sumatra, the characteristic of this tribe is explorers so that the spread of this tribe is quite extensive up to [[Lampung]]. The Komering people is divided into two major groups: ''Komering Ilir'' who lives around [[Kayu Agung]] and ''Komering Ulu'' who live around the city of [[Baturaja]]. The Komering peopleis divided into several clans, including the ''Paku Sengkunyit'' clan, ''Sosoh Buay Rayap'' clan, ''Peliyung Pemuka Buay'' clan, ''Bu Madang'' clan, and the ''Semendawai'' clan. The area of Komering culture is the most extensive area compared to the cultural areas of other tribes in South Sumatra. In addition, when viewed from the character of the people, the Komering people is known to have a high and hard temper. Based on folklore in the Komering community, the ancestor of the Komering people and the ancestor of the [[Batak|Batak people]] in [[North Sumatra]], are said to be still brothers. The brothers who came from across the country. After arriving in Sumatra, they separated. The older brother went south to become the ancestor of the Komering people, and the younger brother to the north became ancestor of the [[Batak people]].\n\nThe Semendo people live in the Semendo District, [[Muara Enim Regency]]. Historically, the Semendo people came from the descendants of the [[Bantenese people]] who, in the past few centuries, traveled from Java to the island of Sumatra, and later settled and gave birth to grandchildren in the Semendo area. Nearly 100% of Semendo's population depends on agricultural products, which are still processed in traditional ways. Agricultural land in this area is quite fertile, because it is approximately 900 meters above sea level. There are two main commodities from this area: [[Robusta coffee]] with a total production of 300 tons per year, and rice, where this area is one of the rice barns for the area of South Sumatra. Customs and culture of this region are strongly influenced by the strong Islamic breath. Starting from tambourine music, folk songs and dances are strongly influenced by the [[Malay culture]] and [[Islamic culture]]. The language used in everyday life is the [[Bengkulu language|Semendo language]].\n\n=== Language ===\nWhile [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is the official language in the province, most of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] speak a dialect of the [[Malay language]] called the [[Musi language|Palembang Malay]] or Musi. Currently, Palembang Malay has become the [[lingua franca]] in the region. Palembang Malay originated from the [[Old Malay language]] which blends with [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and is pronounced according to the accent of the Palembang people. Moreover, this language has absorbed words from [[Arabic]], [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], because Palembang was once a large trading city, attracting various kinds of merchants from various places. In the past, Palembang Malay was written with the [[Jawi script]], a modified version of the [[Arabic script]]. Nowadays, the user of the Jawi script is diminishing and being replaced by the [[Latin script]].\n\nPalembang Malay consists of two [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], first is the everyday language that is used almost by everyone in the city or also called the ''bahasa pasar'' (market language). Secondly is the polite and formal style (''Bebaso''), which is used by limited circles, such as sultans and nobility. Usually spoken by and for people who are respected or who are older. As used by children to parents, daughter-in-law to parents-in-law, students to teachers, or between speakers of the same age as the purpose of mutual respect, because ''Bebaso'' means to speak politely and subtly.\n\nHowever, migrants often use their local language as a daily language, such as [[Komering language|Komering]], [[Rawas language|Rawas]], [[Musi language|Musi]] and Lahat. Migrants from outside South Sumatra sometimes also use their local language as a daily language in their families or regional communities. However, to communicate with other Palembang residents, residents generally use the Palembang Malay as their daily language of instruction. In addition to the indigenous people, in Palembang there are also migrants and descendants, such as from Java, [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Madurese people|Madura]], [[Bugis]] and [[Banjar people|Banjar]]. Many descendants living in Palembang are [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], [[Arab Indonesians|Arabs]] and [[Indian Indonesians|Indian]].\n\n[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is generally used as a second language and also as the language of education and for official purposes.\n\n===Religion===\nThe people of the province, as with other parts of Sumatra with the exception of Bangka Belitung and [[North Sumatra]] provinces, overwhelmingly follow the [[Shafi'i]] school of law of [[Sunni Islam]]. The religion is mainly adopted by the ethnic Malays, Javanese, Minangkabau, and Sundanese. Other minority religions are also practiced; the Chinese primarily follow [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]].\n\n== Culture ==\nLike most other provincial cultures on the island of [[Sumatra]], the culture of the province of South Sumatra is largely influenced by [[Malay culture]]. In addition, there are some cultures that are influenced by [[Islam]], and some are influenced by the greatness of the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya kingdom]]. South Sumatra's cultural wealth includes traditional houses, traditional clothing, various types of dances, as well as typical food from the area. The cultural wealth of South Sumatra is not only popular within the South Sumatra region itself.\n\nIn all corners of Indonesia, various South Sumatran cultures are well-known, even popular with many people. An example is the ''[[rumah limas]]'' traditional house, this house has been adopted by many people in various regions because the construction is not complicated. In addition, [[songket]] weaving is also a distinctive fabric favored by many people. The South Sumatran signature food, [[Pempek]], can not only be found in the city of [[Palembang]] and the surrounding area, but also has spread throughout Indonesia as well as neighbouring countries such as [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]].\n\n=== Traditional house ===\n[[File:TMII South Sumatra Pavilion Limas House.jpg|thumb|''[[Rumah limas]]'', the traditional house of South Sumatra]]\n''[[Rumah limas]]'' is a traditional house in the province of South Sumatra. The architecture of this traditional house is influenced by [[Islamic culture]] and [[Malay culture]]. Although this traditional house originated from South Sumatra, it has influenced the construction of other traditional houses in the other places.\n\nThe ''rumah limas'' traditional house has an area of between 400 and 1000 square meters. The whole house, resting on wooden pillars that were slung on the ground. The ''rumah limas'' is divided into several parts, namely the main room ''pangkeng'' (bedroom), and ''pawon'' (kitchen). The main room is located at the top level and right under the limas roof. In this room there is an ''amben'' or a conference room. This room is located in the center of the ''rumah limas'', both for customary and decorative purposes. The ''pangkeng'' section is a bedroom. This section of space is on the right or left side. To enter the ''pangkeng'' room, it must be done by passing a box-shaped door cover. The box serves as a storage area for various tools.\n\nOn the back is the ''pawon''. ''pawon'' is part of the kitchen of this traditional house. The word ''pawon'' is actually not only known in South Sumatra. The [[Javanese people]], besides adapting the Limas house shape, also recognize the word ''pawon'' to mention the position of the kitchen in their home.\n\n=== Traditional clothes ===\nSouth Sumatra's traditional clothes are known by the name ''Aesan gede'', symbolizing greatness, and ''Aesan paksangko'' which that symbolizes the elegance of the people of South Sumatra. These traditional clothes are usually only used during traditional wedding ceremonies. With the understanding that this marriage ceremony is a big ceremony. By using ''Aesan Gede'' or ''Aesan Paksangko'' as a bridal costume it means something very elegant because the bride and groom are portrayed as kings and queens. The difference between ''Aesan Gede'' and ''Aesan Paksongko'' patterns, if detailed as follows; Pink Gede style combined with golden color. Both colors are believed to reflect the majesty of the [[Srivijaya|Sriwijaya]] nobles. Especially with the glittering of complementary jewelry and the crown of ''Aesan Gede,'' ''bungo cempako'', ''kembang goyang,'' and the standard kelapo. Then they are combined with dodot clothes and lepus songket cloth patterned in silver for the ''Aesan Paksangkong.'' For men using gold embroidered [[songket]] lepus, robes of gold flower motifs, songket sling, sleeves, and golden [[songkok]] worn on the head. And for women using lotus, red noble brackets studded with golden star flowers, lepus songket cloth embroidered with gold, and headdress in the form of ''Aesan Paksangkong'' crown. Also not to forget the clothes decorating clothes such as jewelry with golden images, stand-by dress, rocking flowers, and kenango flowers.\n[[File:Tari Kebagh, 2017.jpg|thumb|''Kebagh'' dance from [[Pagar Alam]], South Sumatra]]\n\n=== Traditional dance ===\n[[Gending Sriwijaya]] is a regional song and also a fairly popular dance from Palembang. This Gending Sriwijaya song was performed to accompany the ''tarian Gending Sriwijaya'' dance. Both songs and dances depict the nobility of culture, glory, and the majesty of the former [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Empire]] which once triumphed in uniting the western [[Nusantara]]. This Sriwijaya Gending dance from South Sumatra was performed to welcoming honored guests. Usually, this dance is performed by as many as thirteen dancers, consisting of nine core dancers and four companions and singers.\n\nTanggai dance or ''tari Tangga'' is a traditional dance from South Sumatra that is also dedicated to welcoming honored guests. In contrast to Gending Sriwijaya dance, Tanggai dance is performed by five people wearing local clothing such as [[songket]], ''dodot'', ''pending'', necklaces and other decorations. This dance is a combination of graceful motion with typical regional clothing. This dance describes the people of Palembang who are friendly and respectful, respecting and loving guests visiting their area.\n\nTenun songket dance or ''tarian tenun songket'' is a reflection of the daily lives of housewives and young women in South Sumatra. In their daily lives, housewives and young women do work in the form of songket weaving which is a special fabric of their region. Aside from being an effort to preserve traditional dances, this dance is at the same time as a promotion of their regional special fabrics, namely [[songket]].\n\n=== Traditional weapon ===\nThe first traditional South Sumatra weapon and often a cultural icon of the province is the [[trident]], or locally known as ''trisula''. This spear is shaped like a wooden spear with 3 sharp eyes at the end. The spear length is as high as an adult, which is around 180&nbsp;cm and used to be used by Srivijaya royal warriors as the main weapon. ''[[Kris]]'' is not only used by the people of Java. Some other sub-ethnic Malays also recognize this type of weapon in their culture, including the people of South Sumatra. Although it has the same shape, the South Sumatra ''kris'' has its own characteristics. The number of curves or curves is always an odd number between 7 and 13 with a wide angle. That is why the typical South Sumatra ''kris'' tends to be longer and taper. ''Skin'' is a traditional South Sumatra weapon which is thought to originate from acculturation of local culture to the culture of Chinese traders and [[East Asia]] in the past. This weapon looks like a typical [[West Sumatra]] ''[[Karambit|Kerambit]]'', but is smaller in size and has 2 sharp blades.\n\n== Transport ==\nMany forms of transportations are available in the province. As a province traversed by several large rivers, the people of South Sumara also recognize the importance water transport, which is called ''ketek''. This ''ketek'' serves river crossings through various piers along the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi]], [[Ogan River|Ogan]] and [[Komering River|Komering]] Rivers.\n\nThere are three public operational airports in the province, with the [[Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport]] in [[Palembang]] being the largest and the busiest in the province. This airport is located northwest of Palembang, serving both domestic and international flights. The airport is also a hajj embarkation for residents of South Sumatra. Domestic flights are served to and from [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Batam]], [[Pangkal Pinang]] and other cities, as well as international destinations such as [[Singapore]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] in [[Malaysia]]. The other two airports are th [[Silampari Airport]] in [[Lubuklinggau]] and the [[Atung Bungsu Airport]] in [[Pagar Alam]]. These two airports only serve regional flights.\n\nSouth Sumatra also has three main ports namely Boom Baru, Port 36 Ilir and Tanjung Api-Api Port. These three ports serve passenger transportation using ferries to Muntok ([[Bangka Island|Bangka]]) and Batam. Currently the Tanjung Api-Api Port is being built which serves the transportation of passengers and goods in and out of South Sumatra.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Transportation in South Sumatra\">\nFile:SMB2IA LRT arriving.jpg|The [[Palembang Light Rail Transit]] serving passengers from the [[Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport]] to the [[Palembang]] city center\nFile:Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin Airport Front.jpg|[[Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport]] is the busiest and largest airport of the province, and the main point of entry to the capital city of Palembang\nFile:Pahala kencana.jpg|A local bus in South Sumatra\nFile:KA Serelo 08-2015.JPG|An intercity train bound for Palembang ready for departure at Lubuklinggau railway station\n</gallery>In addition, there are several railway lines in the province. [[Kertapati railway station]] in [[Palembang]] is the largest station in the province. It serves trains to and from [[Lubuklinggau]] and [[Bandar Lampung]] in [[Lampung]] province, and also smaller towns such as [[Baturaja]], [[Lahat Regency|Lahat]] and [[Prabumulih]]. Currently, the railway only terminates in Lubuklinggau, but there is a plan to construct a railway to [[Bengkulu]], which would allow to boost passengers movement and economic growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.detik.com/infrastruktur/d-4429983/jokowi-janji-rampungkan-bandara-dan-jalur-kereta-di-bengkulu|title=Jokowi Janji Rampungkan Bandara dan Jalur Kereta di Bengkulu|last=Jordan|first=Ray|website=detikfinance|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> Moreover, a railway from Palembang to [[Betung]] in [[Jambi]] is also in the planning stage, which would be connected further to [[Riau]] and [[North Sumatra]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jambi.antaranews.com/berita/325945/pemprov-pembangunan-rel-ka-jambi-tetap-berjalan|title=Pemprov: pembangunan rel KA Jambi tetap berjalan - ANTARA News Jambi|last=Agency|first=ANTARA News|website=Antara News|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> Overall, these projects would form the backbone of the Trans-Sumatra Railway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.detik.com/infrastruktur/d-3679428/sumatera-punya-1276-km-rel-ka-tapi-putus-putus|title=Sumatera Punya 1.276 Km Rel KA, Tapi Putus-Putus|last=Idris|first=Muhammad|website=detikfinance|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Palembang Light Rail Transit]] started operating in August 2018.

The province also has 4.18 trillion standard cubic feet of natural gas and 757.4 standard cubic feet of natural oil.<ref>[http://waspada.co.id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=197222:indian-investor-to-build-railroad-track-in-s-sumatra&catid=30:english-news&Itemid=101 Indian investor to build railroad track in S Sumatra<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nHowever, the agricultural sector is still the cornerstone of employment in South Sumatra compared to other sectors with absorption reaching 1.9 million people. This figure is in accordance with the potential of the area which has an area of around 774 thousand hectares of agriculture. The potential of agricultural resources in South Sumatra is quite prominent with annual production of [[rice]] reaching 4.2 million tons, [[Maize|corn]] production reaching 289 thousand tons, [[soybean]]s production reaching 16 thousand tons, [[palm oil]] production reaching 2.718 million tons, [[coffee]] (dry beans) production reaching 135.2 thousand tons, [[coconut]] production reaching 65 thousand tons. In addition to the agricultural sector, the other two sectors also absorb labor, namely the large and retail trade sector, car and motorcycle repair and the processing industry. In the trade sector there are 688,000 workers, and the processing industry reaches 279,300 people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wartaekonomi.co.id/read181466/bps-mayoritas-warga-sumsel-bekerja-di-sektor-pertanian.html|title=BPS: Mayoritas Warga Sumsel Bekerja di Sektor Pertanian|date=2018-05-19|website=Warta Ekonomi|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De rivier de Musi bij Palembang TMnr 5426-8.jpg|thumb|A painting depicting fishing boats on the [[Musi River (Indonesia)]]]]\nThe economy of South Sumatra in the second quarter of 2017 continued to show improvement compared to previous quarters. The realization of economic growth in South Sumatra in the second quarter of 2017 was 5.24% (YoY), higher than the first quarter of 2017 of 5.13% (YoY). From the demand side, the component of foreign exports is still the main pillar of economic growth. This was mainly supported by improvements in the prices of superior commodities in South Sumatra, namely [[Natural rubber|rubber]] and [[coal]]. In addition, export performance was driven by improvements in the economic conditions of the main destination countries for South Sumatra's exports, including the [[United States]], [[China]] and [[Europe]]. On the other hand, an increase in export performance has no impact on increasing household consumption. The slowdown in household consumption is estimated to be caused by the consumption pattern of people experiencing a shift. The community began to reduce tertiary needs reflected in the decline in the consumption index of durable goods. Meanwhile, in the second quarter of 2017 government consumption declined due to some government projects still in the auction stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bi.go.id/id/publikasi/kajian-ekonomi-regional/sumsel/Pages/Kajian-Ekonomi-dan-Keuangan-Regional-Provinsi-Sumatera-Selatan-Agustus-2017.aspx |title=Kajian Ekonomi dan Keuangan Regional Provinsi Sumatera Selatan Agustus 2017 - Bank Sentral Republik Indonesia |website=www.bi.go.id|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\n== Cuisine ==\n{{main|Palembang cuisine}}\nThe South Sumatran cuisine or also known as the Palembang cuisine is the cuisine of the city of [[Palembang]] and the surrounding area in South Sumatra. It is the second most well-known cuisine from [[Sumatra]] after [[Padang cuisine|Padang]]. Palembang cuisine primarily uses [[freshwater fish]] and [[prawn]]s as key ingredients due to the paramount role of the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]] for the area. Popular freshwater fish includes ''patin'' (''[[Pangasius pangasius|Pangasius]]''), ''baung'' (''[[Hemibagrus]]''), ''lais'' (''[[Kryptopterus cryptopterus]]''), ''lele'' ([[catfish]]), ''gabus'' ([[Snakehead (fish)|snakehead]]), ''mas'' ([[carp]]) and ''gurame'' ([[gourami]]). Historically, Palembang waters were teeming with ''belido'' ([[giant featherback]]), and it has become the city's official animal mascot. It is valued for its succulent flavour and soft texture. However, due to [[overfishing]], today the ''belido'' fish are scarce and probably already extinct in Musi river area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.liputan6.com/regional/read/3067075/tugu-ikan-belido-di-palembang-bakal-saingi-merlion-singapura|title=Tugu Ikan Belido di Palembang Bakal Saingi Merlion Singapura|last=Liputan6.com|work=liputan6.com|access-date=2018-07-18|language=id}}</ref> Because of its location that is not far from the sea, seafood such as shrimp, ''tenggiri'' ([[wahoo]]), ''kakap merah'' ([[red snapper]]) and [[Spanish mackerel]] are also popular in Palembang.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.triposo.com/loc/Palembang/eatingout/background |title=Palembang Eat and drink |website=triposo.com |access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref> Besides freshwater fish dishes, there are many variations of dishes, snacks, drinks, and sweets in Palembang cuisine.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Cuisine of South Sumatra\">\nFile:Pempek Kuah Cuko.jpg|''[[Pempek]]'' (fish cake) Kapal Selam and Kriting, simmered with Kuah Cuko\nFile:Laksan Palembang 1.jpg|''[[Laksan]] Palembang'', fish cake similar to pempek served in rich coconut milk-based soup, and sprinkled with crispy fried shallot.\nFile:A bowl of Tekwan.jpg|A bowl of ''[[Tekwan]]''\nFile:Mie Celor Palembang.jpg|''[[Mie celor]] Palembang''\n</gallery>\n\nSpices are also generally included although not as liberally as its same-island counterpart.

Pempek, tekwan and mie celor are the example of Chinese cuisine influence on Palembang. Pempek is basically fishcake made from deboned fish flesh and tapioca flour, which was a local adaptation of East Asian [[surimi]] fishcake making. Like most of noodle dishes of Indonesia, mie celor can trace its origin back to Chinese influences. It was popularly believed that Palembang preference of sweet flavour was due to Javanese influences that favoured palm sugar. Indeed, Palembang absorbs many [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] elements, including language and cuisine. For example, both [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Palembang Malay]] dialects refer fish as ''iwak'', and [[Pepes|cooking method employing banana leaf package]] as ''brengkes'' or ''brengkesan''.<ref name=\"Detikfood Palembang\" /> Martabak Palembang and nasi minyak which uses ghee, on the other hand, demonstrate Indian cuisine influence in the city.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Jakabaring_Aquatic_Center,_SEA_Games_2011_Palembang_1.jpg|right|thumb|Jakabaring Aquatic Center in Jakabaring Sport City complex.]]\nSouth Sumatra, especially the city of Palembang is notable as the host city [[2018 Asian Games]] along with Jakarta, the first Asian Games hold officially by two cities and the fourth host city of Asian Games in Southeast Asia after Bangkok in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.beritasatu.com/olahraga/211563/jakarta-dan-palembang-resmi-menjadi-tuan-rumah-asian-games-2018|title=Jakarta dan Palembang Resmi Menjadi Tuan Rumah Asian Games 2018|last=BeritaSatu.com|website=beritasatu.com|language=id|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> Palembang is also the main host of [[2011 Southeast Asian Games]] and hosted two matches of [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antaranews.com/berita/147065/kota-palembang-menjadi-tuan-rumah-sea-games-2011|title=Kota Palembang Menjadi Tuan Rumah SEA Games 2011|last=antaranews.com|website=Antara News|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2009/10/21/21005749/palembang.siap.gelar.pembukaan.sea.games.2011 |title=Palembang Siap Gelar Pembukaan SEA Games 2011 |author=Kompas Cyber Media |website=KOMPAS.com |language=id |access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sport.detik.com/sepakbola/liga-indonesia/d-749234/final-3-4-piala-asia-di-palembang |title=Final 3-4 Piala Asia di Palembang |website=sepakbola |access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> Sport facilities have been build across the city since 1971 to host ''Pekan Olahraga Mahasiswa'' (POM) IX, although the city's main sport complex, [[Jakabaring Sport City]] started its construction in 1998 and expanded later in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palembangdalamsketsa.com/2012/07/pekan-olah-raga-mahasiswa-ix-palembang.html |title=Pekan Olah Raga Mahasiswa IX Palembang Tahun 1971 |last=Sketsa |first=Diposting oleh Palembang Dalam |access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sumber.com/component/k2/sumber/stadion-jakabaring.html |title=Stadion Jakabaring |last=Wahyudi |first=Rendra |date=2017-04-27 |website=sumber.com |language=id-ID |access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> In order to keep the sport complex in frequent use, several plans have been raised by the government to encourage more sporting events into the city, including the purchase of an association football club, Persijatim Solo F.C in 2004 which then renamed to [[Sriwijaya F.C.]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/id/features/mengapa-klub-klub-indonesia-mudah-pindah-dan-berganti-nama |title=Mengapa Klub-Klub Indonesia Mudah Pindah dan Berganti Nama? |date=2016-04-13 |work=FourFourTwo |access-date=2018-05-06 |language=id-ID}}</ref> Palembang also planned to build a [[race track]] inside the complex to host a [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] race in the city.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.liputan6.com/bola/read/3207966/palembang-optimistis-jadi-tuan-rumah-motogp-2019 |title=Palembang Optimistis Jadi Tuan Rumah MotoGP 2019 |author=Liputan6.com |access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Association football|Football]] is regarded as the most popular sport in South Sumatra.

The city was frequented by many traders from the [[Middle East|Middle-East]], the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian Subcountinent]] and [[China]]. At the height of its power, the territory of the Srivijaya Empire reached modern-day [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Malaysia]]. After Srivijaya collapsed in the 14th century, small kingdoms began to establish itself in the province. Beginning in the 16th century, [[Islam]] began to [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|spread]] in the region, effectively replacing [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] as the dominant religion in the region. In the 17th century, the Islamic [[Palembang Sultanate]] was established with Palembang as its capital. At that time, however, Europeans began arriving in the region, first the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and then the [[Dutch people|Dutch]]. The Dutch became the dominant power in the region. Through the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), the Dutch exerted influence on the Palembang Sultanate. In 1811, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the last Sultan of Palembang, Sultan [[Mahmud Badaruddin II]] attacked the Dutch in Palembang, but he refused to cooperate with the British, so [[Stamford Raffles|Thomas Stamford Raffles]] sent troops to attack Palembang and Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II was forced to flee the royal palace, then Raffles appointed the Sultan Ahmad Najamuddin II, brother of Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II as king. In 1813 Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II again took over the kingdom, but one month later he was brought down again by Raffles and reappointed Sultan Ahmad Najamuddin II, causing a split in the Sultanate of Palembang.<ref name=\"Ricklefs140\">{{cite book|title=A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|page=140|authorlink=Merle Calvin Ricklefs}}</ref> After the Dutch returned to the region, the Dutch attacked and annexed the sultanate to the [[Dutch East Indies]], and exiled the sultan and his family to [[Ternate]]. The Dutch controlled the region for the next century, but during [[World War II]], the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Battle of Palembang|attacked Palembang]] and expelled the Dutch. The Japanese occupied the region until August 1945, when they surrendered to the Allied forces. The Dutch attempted to return to the region, but this was opposed by the newly-declared [[Republic Of Indonesia]], resulting in a [[Indonesian National Revolution|War of Independence]].

The Sundanese manuscript of [[Carita Parahyangan]] composed around the late 16th-century in West Java, mentioned vaguely about a princely hero that rose to be a king named [[Sanjaya of Mataram|Sanjaya]] that after secured his rule in Java \u2014 involved in battle with the Malayu and Keling, against their king named \"Sang Sri Wijaya\". The term [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] is a [[Javanese language|Javanese]]-[[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] term to refer [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]] of Sumatra, while [[Keling]] \u2014 derived from historical [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga kingdom]] of [[South India|Southern India,]] refer to people of Indian descent that inhabit the archipelago. Fascinatingly, the name Srivijaya still being found in this local manuscript, although was mistakenly refer to a king. Subsequently, after studying both local stone inscriptions, manuscripts and Chinese historical accounts, historians concluded that the term \"Srivijaya\" refer to a polity or a kingdom.\n\nSrivijaya is called by various names. The [[Chinese people|Chinese]] call it Shih-li-fo-shih or San-fo-ts'i or San Fo Qi. In [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali|Pali languages]], the Srivijaya kingdom was called ''Yavadesh'' and ''Javadeh,'' while the [[Arabs]] call it ''Zabaj,'' and the [[Khmer people]] called it ''Malayu''.{{sfn|Sucipto|2009|p=30}} The number of names is another reason why Srivijaya is very difficult to find.

Archeologist have found the ruins of Srivijaya temples as far as [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]]. In the [[7th century CE|7th century,]] the port of [[Champa]] in eastern [[Indochina]] began to divert many traders from Srivijaya. To prevent this, Maharaja [[Dharmasetu]] launched several attacks on coastal cities in Indochina. The city of [[Indrapura (Champa)|Indrapura]] on the banks of the [[Mekong|Mekong river]] was captured by Srivijaya in the early 8th century. Srivijaya continued its domination of Cambodia, until the Khmer king [[Jayavarman II|Jayawarman II]], founder of the [[Khmer Empire]], severed ties with Srivijaya in the same century.<ref name=\"end\" /> At the end of the 8th century some kingdoms in Java, including Tarumanegara and Holing, were under the rule of Srivijaya.

In 955 CE, [[Al-Masudi|Al Masudi]], a traveler and classical Arab historian wrote notes about Sriwijaya. In that note, Srivijaya is described as a large kingdom that is rich, with very many soldiers.

The Chinese news from the [[Song dynasty|Song Dynasty]] called the Srivijaya Kingdom in Sumatra the name ''San-fo-tsi'', while the Kingdom of Medang in Java by the name ''She-po''. It is said that ''San-fo-tsi'' and ''She-po'' were involved in competition for control of Southeast Asia. Both countries sent ambassadors to each other to China. The ''San-fo-tsi'' ambassador who departed in 988 was held in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] when he was about to go home, because his country was attacked by Javanese troops. This attack from Java allegedly took place around the 990s, namely between 988 and 992 during the reign of Sri [[Cudamani Warmadewa]].{{sfn|Munoz|2006|p=150}}\n[[File:Talang Tuo Inscription.jpg|thumb|The [[Talang Tuo inscription|''Talang Tuo'' inscription]] dating from the 7th century AD]]\nThe kingdom of Medang succeeded in capturing [[Palembang]] in 992 for a while, but later the Medang forces were successfully repelled by Sriwijaya forces. The ''Hujung Langit'' inscription of 997 again mentions a Javanese attack on Sumatra. This series of attacks from Java ultimately failed because Java failed to establish a foothold in Sumatra. Capturing the capital city in Palembang is not enough because the Sriwijaya power are spread in several port cities in the [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] region. The Srivijaya emperor, Sri [[Cudamani Warmadewa]], escaped out of the capital and traveled around gathering strength and reinforcements from his allies and subordinate kings to repel the Javanese army. The empire managed to survived and succeeded in repelling the Javanese navy.\n\nIn 1025, the empire was defeated by the [[Chola dynasty|Chola Empire]] (during the period of Emperor [[Rajendra Chola]] I) of southern [[India]].<ref>Early kingdoms of the Indonesian archipelago and the Malay Peninsula by Paul Michel Munoz p.161</ref><ref>Cengage Advantage Books: The Earth and Its Peoples by Richard Bulliet, Pamela Crossley, Daniel Headrick, Steven Hirsch, Lyman Johnson p.182</ref> The Chola Empire had conquered the Sriwijaya colonies, such as the [[Nicobar Islands]] region and at the same time succeeded in capturing the ruling Srivijaya king at that time [[Sangrama Vijayatunggavarman]]. During the following decades, the entire Srivijaya empire was under the influence of the Chola dynasty. Nonetheless, Rajendra Chola I still gave the opportunity to the kings he conquered to remain in power while remaining submissive to him.<ref>Sastri K. A. N., (1935). ''The Cholas''. University of Madras.</ref> Srivijaya's capital eventually moved northward to Jambi. This can be attributed to the news of the ''San-fo-ts'i'' delegation to China in 1028. Another factor in Sriwijaya's decline was natural factors. Because of the sedimentation of mud on the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]] and several other tributaries, the merchant ships arriving in Palembang diminished.{{sfn|Sucipto|2009|p=29}} As a result, the city of Palembang is getting away from the sea and not being strategic.

Rockhill]] ''[http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CADAL/B31403797/ Chao Jukua, His Work on the Chinese and Arab Trade in the Twelfth and Thirteenth centuries, entitled Chu-fan-chi]'' St Petersburg, 1911.</ref> written around 1225 by [[Zhao Rugua]], the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the [[Southeast Asia]]n archipelago were Srivijaya and [[Java]] ([[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]), with the western part (Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java/[[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]]) under Srivijaya's rule and the eastern part was under Kediri's domination. It says that the people in Java followed two kinds of religions, namely [[Buddhism]] and the religion of [[Brahmins]] ([[Hinduism]]), while the people of Srivijaya followed [[Buddhism]]. The book describes the people of Java as being brave, short-tempered and willing to fight. It also notes that their favourite pastimes were [[cockfighting]] and pig fighting. The coin used as the currency then were made from a mixture of [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[tin]].\n\nSrivijaya remained a formidable sea power until the 13th century.<ref name=\"end\" /> According to C\u0153d\u00e8s, at the end of the 13th century, the empire \"had ceased to exist... caused by the simultaneous pressure on its two flanks of Siam and Java.\"<ref name=\"C\u0153d\u00e8s\">{{cite journal|last=C\u0153d\u00e8s |first=George |authorlink=George C\u0153d\u00e8s |year=1918 |title=Le Royaume de \u00c7riwijaya |journal=Bulletin de l'\u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1\u201336}}</ref>{{rp|204,243}} However, there was virtually a power vacuum in the region since there was no prominent power to hold the region except for the waning [[Majapahit Empire]], itself centered in [[Java]] island. The vacuum allowed pirates to flourish in the region.\n\nAfter being conquered by Majapahit in 1375 AD, the Palembang region was made as one of the vassal or occupied territories of the Majapahit Empire, under the leadership of [[Hayam Wuruk]]. The government in Palembang was handed over to a regent who was appointed directly by Majapahit. However, internal problems in the Majapahit Empire made their attention to the conquered territories not very good. Even the Palembang region was controlled by traders from China. Until finally Majapahit regained control of Palembang after sending a commander named Arya Damar.\n\n===Palembang Sultanate===\n{{Main|Palembang Sultanate}}\n[[File:Mahmud Badaruddin II.jpg|thumb|236x236px|Sultan [[Mahmud Badaruddin II]] of Palembang led a revolt against the Dutch in the 19th century. Ultimately, he was defeated and exiled to [[the Moluccas]]. Today he is commemorated as the [[National Hero of Indonesia|national hero of Indonesia]].]]\nBy the late 15th century, [[Islam]] has spread throughout the region, replacing [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] as the dominant religion. Around the early 16th century, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], an adventurer from [[Portugal]], said that Palembang had been led by an appointed ''[[Vicegerent|patih]]'' (regent) from Java who was later referred to the [[Demak Sultanate]] and participated in attacking [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], which at that time had been controlled by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]]. In 1659, Sri Susuhunan Abdurrahman proclaimed the establishment of the [[Palembang Sultanate]]. The Sultanate of Palembang stood for almost two centuries, namely from 1659 to 1825. Sultan Ratu Abdurrahman Kholifatul Mukminin Sayidul Iman, or Sunan Cinde Walang, was the first king in the Sultanate of Palembang.\n\nThe reign of Sultan Muhammad Bahauddin (1776\u20131803) was also known as the golden era of the Palembang Sultanate which was quite successful. In his time, the sultanate's economy increased sharply because the sultan had mastered the techniques of how to trade well, including trading with VOCs. In fact, the VOC was upset with Sultan Bahauddin's trade monopoly which caused his contracts to be rejected often. As it turned out, Sultan Bahauddin preferred to trade with [[British Empire|Britain]], [[Qing dynasty|China]] and [[Malay People|Malay people]] in [[Riau]]. The impact of such a policy actually generates enormous wealth for the empire's wealth. Thus, the prosperity of the Sultanate of Palembang sharply increased. The Palembang Sultanate was strategically located in conducting trade relations, especially the results of spices with outside parties. The Palembang Sultanate also ruled over the [[Bangka Belitung Islands|Bangka-Belitung islands]] which had a tin mine and had been traded since the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|page=139|authorlink=Merle Calvin Ricklefs}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[Dutch East India Company]] increased its influence in the region, the Sultanate started to decline and losing its power. During [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1812, the sultan at that time, [[Mahmud Badaruddin II]] repudiated British claims to suzerainty. The British, under [[Stamford Raffles]] responded by attacking Palembang, sacking the court, and installing sultan's more cooperative younger brother, Najamuddin to the throne. The Dutch attempted to recover their influence at the court in 1816, but Sultan Najamuddin was uncooperative with them. An expedition launched by the Dutch in 1818 and captured Sultan Najamudin and exiled him to Batavia. A Dutch garrison was established in 1821, but sultan attempted an attack and a mass poisoning to the garrison, which were intervened by Dutch. Mahmud Badaruddin II was exiled to [[Ternate]], and his palace was burned to the ground. The Sultanate was later abolished by Dutch and direct colonial rule was established.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul E.|location=New York|page=663|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert M.}}</ref>\n\n===Dutch colonial rule===\n{{expand section|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Japanese occupation and independence===\nSouthern Sumatra was occupied by the Japanese in January 15, 1942 after the [[Battle of Palembang]] in [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/palembang.html|title=The Battle for Palembang |website=dutcheastindies.webs.com |access-date=22 March 2019}}</ref> After the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]], South Sumatra became a part of Sumatra Province as a [[Residency (country subdivision)|residency]] with [[Adnan Kapau Gani]] as the resident. On January 1, 1947, the Dutch tried to gain its sovereignty over South Sumatra by invading Palembang. Since then, fighting ensued across South Sumatra until Indonesia's independence was recognized by the Dutch on December 27, 1949. The area occupied by the Netherlands in South Sumatra was incorporated into [[South Sumatra State]] under the [[United States of Indonesia]] until the disbandment of the union and the founding of the republic. On September 12, 1950, South Sumatra province was established with a territory much larger than it is today, as it encompassed several provinces that were eventually given autonomy: [[Lampung]] was carved from the southern part of the province in 1964, [[Bengkulu]] from the coastal western part of the province in 1967, and [[Bangka-Belitung Islands|Bangka Belitung]] from the titular islands on December 4, 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irsansingomataram.blogspot.com/2012/07/normal-0-false-false-false-en-us-x-none.html|title=Irsan Singo Mataram: Sejarah Sumatera Selatan|first=Bunga Mayang Tiuh|last=Kita|date=|website=irsansingomataram.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSouth Sumatra has an area of {{convert|99888.28|km2}} and is located on the island of [[Sumatra]], western [[Indonesia]] which lies south of the equator at 10\u201340 degrees south and 102\u2013108 degrees east. The province is bordered by [[Jambi]] to the north, [[Lampung]] to the south and [[Bengkulu]] to the west, while in the east the [[Bangka Strait]] separates the province and the island-province of [[Bangka Belitung Islands]].\n\nOn the east coast the land consists of swamps and brackets which are affected by tides. Its vegetation is in the form of palmate plants and [[mangrove]]. A little more western is a vast lowland. Far to the west near the border of [[Bengkulu]] and [[Jambi]] lies the [[Barisan Mountains|Bukit Barisan mountains]], which divides South Sumatra and is a mountainous area with an altitude of 900\u20131,200 meters above sea level. Barisan Hill consists of the summit of Mount Seminung (1,964 m asl), [[Mount Dempo]] (3,159 m asl), [[Mount Patah]] (1,107 m asl), and Mount Bungkuk (2,125 m asl). To the west of Bukit Barisan is a slope. In the Bukit Barisan valley there are areas of rubber, oil palm, and agriculture plantations, especially coffee, tea and vegetables. Mount Dempo is the highest point in the province.\n\nSouth Sumatra has large rivers that can be navigated, but currently, because of the silting process, it cannot be navigated by large ships. Most of the rivers have flows from the Bukit Barisan mountains, except the [[Mesuji River|Mesuji]], Lalan and [[Banyuasin River|Banyuasin]] River. Much of water from South Sumatra section of Bukit Barisan mountains flows eastwards into [[Bangka Strait]] as [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]], with [[Ogan River|Ogan]], Komering, Lematang, Kelingi, Lakitan, Rupit River and [[Rawas River|Rawas]] River are its major tributaries. A few rivers in South Sumatra flow westwards into [[Indian Ocean]], for example Manna River in Pagaralam and Tanjung Sakti.\n\nIn January 2020, two islands in South Sumatra, Betet Island and Gundul Island, were submerged as a result of [[Climate change in Indonesia|climate change]], and four other islands were close to being submerged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gili-lombok.com/sembilang-national-park.html|title=Sembilang National Park - South Sumatra Swamp Forest|last=|first=|date=2020|website=www.gili-lombok.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\nThis region has a [[Tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]] climate, similar to most other Indonesian provinces. Throughout the year the province is only affected by two seasons, namely the rainy season and the dry season. The air temperature varies from 24.7 to 32.9 degrees Celsius with air humidity levels ranging from 82% to 88%. The relative rainy season falls from October to April. Variation in rainfall ranges from 2,100&nbsp;mm to 3,264&nbsp;mm. December is the month with the most rainfall while the dry season usually starts in June to September.\n\nThe season in South Sumatra is similar to other regions in Indonesia, only known for two seasons, namely the dry season and the rainy season. From June to September wind flows from [[Australia]] and do not contain much water vapor, resulting in a dry season. Conversely in December to March many wind currents contain water vapor from [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] during the rainy season. Such conditions occur every half year after passing the transition period in between April - May and October - November.{{Weather box|location=Palembang|metric first=Yes|single line=yes\n<!-- -->|Jan high C=30.8|Feb high C=31.2|Mar high C=31.5|Apr high C=32.1|May high C=32.4|Jun high C=31.9|Jul high C=31.8|Aug high C=32.1|Sep high C=32.5|Oct high C=32.6|Nov high C=31.9|Dec high C=31.1\n<!-- -->|Jan mean C=26.8|Feb mean C=27.1|Mar mean C=27.2|Apr mean C=27.7|May mean C=28.0|Jun mean C=27.4|Jul mean C=27.0|Aug mean C=27.2|Sep mean C=27.5|Oct mean C=27.7|Nov mean C=27.4|Dec mean C=27.0\n<!-- -->|Jan low C=22.9|Feb low C=23.0|Mar low C=23.0|Apr low C=23.4|May low C=23.6|Jun low C=22.9|Jul low C=22.3|Aug low C=22.4|Sep low C=22.5|Oct low C=22.9|Nov low C=23.0|Dec low C=23.0\n<!-- -->|Jan precipitation mm=277|Feb precipitation mm=262|Mar precipitation mm=329|Apr precipitation mm=263|May precipitation mm=213|Jun precipitation mm=122|Jul precipitation mm=104|Aug precipitation mm=107|Sep precipitation mm=120|Oct precipitation mm=186|Nov precipitation mm=274|Dec precipitation mm=366\n<!-- -->|Jan sun=169|Feb sun=118|Mar sun=130|Apr sun=150|May sun=174|Jun sun=127|Jul sun=130|Aug sun=149|Sep sun=118|Oct sun=160|Nov sun=132|Dec sun=120\n<!-- -->|source 1=Climate-Data.org<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/764268/|title=Climate Palembang: Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table for Palembang - Climate-Data.org|author=|date=|work=climate-data.org}}</ref>|source 2=[[Deutscher Wetterdienst]]<ref>ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/multi_annual/sunshine_duration/1961_1990.txt</ref><ref>ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/help/stations_list_CLIMAT_data.txt</ref>|date=December 2010}}<br />\nAs in most other province of Indonesia, South Sumatra has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Af'') bordering on a tropical monsoon climate.

Forming the next largest group is the other [[Malayan languages|Malayan]]-speaking populations as well as the Komering, a distinct Malayo-Polynesian people related to the native Lampungese from neighboring [[Lampung]]. [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], and [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] also form minorities in the province.\n\n[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] are the majority in this province. They are also often called Palembang people. Palembang people are divided into two groups: ''Wong Jeroo'' is a descendant of nobility and is slightly lower than the courtiers from the past kingdom based in Palembang, and ''Wong Jabo'' is a commoner. An expert on the origin of Palembang people who are also descendants of the king, admitted that the Palembang people was the descendant of [[Arabs]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and other [[ethnic groups in Indonesia]]. Palembang people itself has two different languages, namely ''Baso Palembang Alus'' and ''Baso Palembang Sari-Sari''. The Palembang people still lives in a house built on water. The architectural model of the Palembang house which is most typical is the ''[[rumah limas]]'' which is mostly erected on stilts on the water to protect from flooding that continues to occur until now. In the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi river]] area, Palembang people often offer their wares on boats.\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Drie ongehuwde jonge vrouwen uit Komering TMnr 10005250.jpg|thumb|Three Komering girls in 1929]]\nKomering is one of the tribes or cultural regions in South Sumatra, which is along the [[Komering River]]. Like other ethnic groupsin South Sumatra, the characteristic of this tribe is explorers so that the spread of this tribe is quite extensive up to [[Lampung]]. The Komering people is divided into two major groups: ''Komering Ilir'' who lives around [[Kayu Agung]] and ''Komering Ulu'' who live around the city of [[Baturaja]]. The Komering peopleis divided into several clans, including the ''Paku Sengkunyit'' clan, ''Sosoh Buay Rayap'' clan, ''Peliyung Pemuka Buay'' clan, ''Bu Madang'' clan, and the ''Semendawai'' clan. The area of Komering culture is the most extensive area compared to the cultural areas of other tribes in South Sumatra. In addition, when viewed from the character of the people, the Komering people is known to have a high and hard temper. Based on folklore in the Komering community, the ancestor of the Komering people and the ancestor of the [[Batak|Batak people]] in [[North Sumatra]], are said to be still brothers. The brothers who came from across the country. After arriving in Sumatra, they separated. The older brother went south to become the ancestor of the Komering people, and the younger brother to the north became ancestor of the [[Batak people]].\n\nThe Semendo people live in the Semendo District, [[Muara Enim Regency]]. Historically, the Semendo people came from the descendants of the [[Bantenese people]] who, in the past few centuries, traveled from Java to the island of Sumatra, and later settled and gave birth to grandchildren in the Semendo area. Nearly 100% of Semendo's population depends on agricultural products, which are still processed in traditional ways. Agricultural land in this area is quite fertile, because it is approximately 900 meters above sea level. There are two main commodities from this area: [[Robusta coffee]] with a total production of 300 tons per year, and rice, where this area is one of the rice barns for the area of South Sumatra. Customs and culture of this region are strongly influenced by the strong Islamic breath. Starting from tambourine music, folk songs and dances are strongly influenced by the [[Malay culture]] and [[Islamic culture]]. The language used in everyday life is the [[Bengkulu language|Semendo language]].\n\n=== Language ===\nWhile [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is the official language in the province, most of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] speak a dialect of the [[Malay language]] called the [[Musi language|Palembang Malay]] or Musi. Currently, Palembang Malay has become the [[lingua franca]] in the region. Palembang Malay originated from the [[Old Malay language]] which blends with [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and is pronounced according to the accent of the Palembang people. Moreover, this language has absorbed words from [[Arabic]], [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], because Palembang was once a large trading city, attracting various kinds of merchants from various places. In the past, Palembang Malay was written with the [[Jawi script]], a modified version of the [[Arabic script]]. Nowadays, the user of the Jawi script is diminishing and being replaced by the [[Latin script]].\n\nPalembang Malay consists of two [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], first is the everyday language that is used almost by everyone in the city or also called the ''bahasa pasar'' (market language). Secondly is the polite and formal style (''Bebaso''), which is used by limited circles, such as sultans and nobility. Usually spoken by and for people who are respected or who are older. As used by children to parents, daughter-in-law to parents-in-law, students to teachers, or between speakers of the same age as the purpose of mutual respect, because ''Bebaso'' means to speak politely and subtly.\n\nHowever, migrants often use their local language as a daily language, such as [[Komering language|Komering]], [[Rawas language|Rawas]], [[Musi language|Musi]] and Lahat. Migrants from outside South Sumatra sometimes also use their local language as a daily language in their families or regional communities. However, to communicate with other Palembang residents, residents generally use the Palembang Malay as their daily language of instruction. In addition to the indigenous people, in Palembang there are also migrants and descendants, such as from Java, [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Madurese people|Madura]], [[Bugis]] and [[Banjar people|Banjar]]. Many descendants living in Palembang are [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], [[Arab Indonesians|Arabs]] and [[Indian Indonesians|Indian]].\n\n[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is generally used as a second language and also as the language of education and for official purposes.\n\n===Religion===\nThe people of the province, as with other parts of Sumatra with the exception of Bangka Belitung and [[North Sumatra]] provinces, overwhelmingly follow the [[Shafi'i]] school of law of [[Sunni Islam]]. The religion is mainly adopted by the ethnic Malays, Javanese, Minangkabau, and Sundanese. Other minority religions are also practiced; the Chinese primarily follow [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]].\n\n== Culture ==\nLike most other provincial cultures on the island of [[Sumatra]], the culture of the province of South Sumatra is largely influenced by [[Malay culture]]. In addition, there are some cultures that are influenced by [[Islam]], and some are influenced by the greatness of the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya kingdom]]. South Sumatra's cultural wealth includes traditional houses, traditional clothing, various types of dances, as well as typical food from the area. The cultural wealth of South Sumatra is not only popular within the South Sumatra region itself.\n\nIn all corners of Indonesia, various South Sumatran cultures are well-known, even popular with many people. An example is the ''[[rumah limas]]'' traditional house, this house has been adopted by many people in various regions because the construction is not complicated. In addition, [[songket]] weaving is also a distinctive fabric favored by many people. The South Sumatran signature food, [[Pempek]], can not only be found in the city of [[Palembang]] and the surrounding area, but also has spread throughout Indonesia as well as neighbouring countries such as [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]].\n\n=== Traditional house ===\n[[File:TMII South Sumatra Pavilion Limas House.jpg|thumb|''[[Rumah limas]]'', the traditional house of South Sumatra]]\n''[[Rumah limas]]'' is a traditional house in the province of South Sumatra. The architecture of this traditional house is influenced by [[Islamic culture]] and [[Malay culture]]. Although this traditional house originated from South Sumatra, it has influenced the construction of other traditional houses in the other places.\n\nThe ''rumah limas'' traditional house has an area of between 400 and 1000 square meters. The whole house, resting on wooden pillars that were slung on the ground. The ''rumah limas'' is divided into several parts, namely the main room ''pangkeng'' (bedroom), and ''pawon'' (kitchen). The main room is located at the top level and right under the limas roof. In this room there is an ''amben'' or a conference room. This room is located in the center of the ''rumah limas'', both for customary and decorative purposes. The ''pangkeng'' section is a bedroom. This section of space is on the right or left side. To enter the ''pangkeng'' room, it must be done by passing a box-shaped door cover. The box serves as a storage area for various tools.\n\nOn the back is the ''pawon''. ''pawon'' is part of the kitchen of this traditional house. The word ''pawon'' is actually not only known in South Sumatra. The [[Javanese people]], besides adapting the Limas house shape, also recognize the word ''pawon'' to mention the position of the kitchen in their home.\n\n=== Traditional clothes ===\nSouth Sumatra's traditional clothes are known by the name ''Aesan gede'', symbolizing greatness, and ''Aesan paksangko'' which that symbolizes the elegance of the people of South Sumatra. These traditional clothes are usually only used during traditional wedding ceremonies. With the understanding that this marriage ceremony is a big ceremony. By using ''Aesan Gede'' or ''Aesan Paksangko'' as a bridal costume it means something very elegant because the bride and groom are portrayed as kings and queens. The difference between ''Aesan Gede'' and ''Aesan Paksongko'' patterns, if detailed as follows; Pink Gede style combined with golden color. Both colors are believed to reflect the majesty of the [[Srivijaya|Sriwijaya]] nobles. Especially with the glittering of complementary jewelry and the crown of ''Aesan Gede,'' ''bungo cempako'', ''kembang goyang,'' and the standard kelapo. Then they are combined with dodot clothes and lepus songket cloth patterned in silver for the ''Aesan Paksangkong.'' For men using gold embroidered [[songket]] lepus, robes of gold flower motifs, songket sling, sleeves, and golden [[songkok]] worn on the head. And for women using lotus, red noble brackets studded with golden star flowers, lepus songket cloth embroidered with gold, and headdress in the form of ''Aesan Paksangkong'' crown. Also not to forget the clothes decorating clothes such as jewelry with golden images, stand-by dress, rocking flowers, and kenango flowers.\n[[File:Tari Kebagh, 2017.jpg|thumb|''Kebagh'' dance from [[Pagar Alam]], South Sumatra]]\n\n=== Traditional dance ===\n[[Gending Sriwijaya]] is a regional song and also a fairly popular dance from Palembang. This Gending Sriwijaya song was performed to accompany the ''tarian Gending Sriwijaya'' dance. Both songs and dances depict the nobility of culture, glory, and the majesty of the former [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Empire]] which once triumphed in uniting the western [[Nusantara]]. This Sriwijaya Gending dance from South Sumatra was performed to welcoming honored guests. Usually, this dance is performed by as many as thirteen dancers, consisting of nine core dancers and four companions and singers.\n\nTanggai dance or ''tari Tangga'' is a traditional dance from South Sumatra that is also dedicated to welcoming honored guests. In contrast to Gending Sriwijaya dance, Tanggai dance is performed by five people wearing local clothing such as [[songket]], ''dodot'', ''pending'', necklaces and other decorations. This dance is a combination of graceful motion with typical regional clothing. This dance describes the people of Palembang who are friendly and respectful, respecting and loving guests visiting their area.\n\nTenun songket dance or ''tarian tenun songket'' is a reflection of the daily lives of housewives and young women in South Sumatra. In their daily lives, housewives and young women do work in the form of songket weaving which is a special fabric of their region. Aside from being an effort to preserve traditional dances, this dance is at the same time as a promotion of their regional special fabrics, namely [[songket]].\n\n=== Traditional weapon ===\nThe first traditional South Sumatra weapon and often a cultural icon of the province is the [[trident]], or locally known as ''trisula''. This spear is shaped like a wooden spear with 3 sharp eyes at the end. The spear length is as high as an adult, which is around 180&nbsp;cm and used to be used by Srivijaya royal warriors as the main weapon. ''[[Kris]]'' is not only used by the people of Java. Some other sub-ethnic Malays also recognize this type of weapon in their culture, including the people of South Sumatra. Although it has the same shape, the South Sumatra ''kris'' has its own characteristics. The number of curves or curves is always an odd number between 7 and 13 with a wide angle. That is why the typical South Sumatra ''kris'' tends to be longer and taper. ''Skin'' is a traditional South Sumatra weapon which is thought to originate from acculturation of local culture to the culture of Chinese traders and [[East Asia]] in the past. This weapon looks like a typical [[West Sumatra]] ''[[Karambit|Kerambit]]'', but is smaller in size and has 2 sharp blades.\n\n== Transport ==\nMany forms of transportations are available in the province. As a province traversed by several large rivers, the people of South Sumara also recognize the importance water transport, which is called ''ketek''. This ''ketek'' serves river crossings through various piers along the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi]], [[Ogan River|Ogan]] and [[Komering River|Komering]] Rivers.\n\nThere are three public operational airports in the province, with the [[Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport]] in [[Palembang]] being the largest and the busiest in the province. This airport is located northwest of Palembang, serving both domestic and international flights. The airport is also a hajj embarkation for residents of South Sumatra. Domestic flights are served to and from [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Batam]], [[Pangkal Pinang]] and other cities, as well as international destinations such as [[Singapore]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] in [[Malaysia]]. The other two airports are th [[Silampari Airport]] in [[Lubuklinggau]] and the [[Atung Bungsu Airport]] in [[Pagar Alam]]. These two airports only serve regional flights.\n\nSouth Sumatra also has three main ports namely Boom Baru, Port 36 Ilir and Tanjung Api-Api Port. These three ports serve passenger transportation using ferries to Muntok ([[Bangka Island|Bangka]]) and Batam. Currently the Tanjung Api-Api Port is being built which serves the transportation of passengers and goods in and out of South Sumatra.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Transportation in South Sumatra\">\nFile:SMB2IA LRT arriving.jpg|The [[Palembang Light Rail Transit]] serving passengers from the [[Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport]] to the [[Palembang]] city center\nFile:Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin Airport Front.jpg|[[Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport]] is the busiest and largest airport of the province, and the main point of entry to the capital city of Palembang\nFile:Pahala kencana.jpg|A local bus in South Sumatra\nFile:KA Serelo 08-2015.JPG|An intercity train bound for Palembang ready for departure at Lubuklinggau railway station\n</gallery>In addition, there are several railway lines in the province.

The province also has 4.18 trillion standard cubic feet of natural gas and 757.4 standard cubic feet of natural oil.<ref>[http://waspada.co.id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=197222:indian-investor-to-build-railroad-track-in-s-sumatra&catid=30:english-news&Itemid=101 Indian investor to build railroad track in S Sumatra<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nHowever, the agricultural sector is still the cornerstone of employment in South Sumatra compared to other sectors with absorption reaching 1.9 million people. This figure is in accordance with the potential of the area which has an area of around 774 thousand hectares of agriculture. The potential of agricultural resources in South Sumatra is quite prominent with annual production of [[rice]] reaching 4.2 million tons, [[Maize|corn]] production reaching 289 thousand tons, [[soybean]]s production reaching 16 thousand tons, [[palm oil]] production reaching 2.718 million tons, [[coffee]] (dry beans) production reaching 135.2 thousand tons, [[coconut]] production reaching 65 thousand tons. In addition to the agricultural sector, the other two sectors also absorb labor, namely the large and retail trade sector, car and motorcycle repair and the processing industry. In the trade sector there are 688,000 workers, and the processing industry reaches 279,300 people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wartaekonomi.co.id/read181466/bps-mayoritas-warga-sumsel-bekerja-di-sektor-pertanian.html|title=BPS: Mayoritas Warga Sumsel Bekerja di Sektor Pertanian|date=2018-05-19|website=Warta Ekonomi|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De rivier de Musi bij Palembang TMnr 5426-8.jpg|thumb|A painting depicting fishing boats on the [[Musi River (Indonesia)]]]]\nThe economy of South Sumatra in the second quarter of 2017 continued to show improvement compared to previous quarters. The realization of economic growth in South Sumatra in the second quarter of 2017 was 5.24% (YoY), higher than the first quarter of 2017 of 5.13% (YoY). From the demand side, the component of foreign exports is still the main pillar of economic growth. This was mainly supported by improvements in the prices of superior commodities in South Sumatra, namely [[Natural rubber|rubber]] and [[coal]]. In addition, export performance was driven by improvements in the economic conditions of the main destination countries for South Sumatra's exports, including the [[United States]], [[China]] and [[Europe]]. On the other hand, an increase in export performance has no impact on increasing household consumption. The slowdown in household consumption is estimated to be caused by the consumption pattern of people experiencing a shift. The community began to reduce tertiary needs reflected in the decline in the consumption index of durable goods. Meanwhile, in the second quarter of 2017 government consumption declined due to some government projects still in the auction stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bi.go.id/id/publikasi/kajian-ekonomi-regional/sumsel/Pages/Kajian-Ekonomi-dan-Keuangan-Regional-Provinsi-Sumatera-Selatan-Agustus-2017.aspx |title=Kajian Ekonomi dan Keuangan Regional Provinsi Sumatera Selatan Agustus 2017 - Bank Sentral Republik Indonesia |website=www.bi.go.id|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\n== Cuisine ==\n{{main|Palembang cuisine}}\nThe South Sumatran cuisine or also known as the Palembang cuisine is the cuisine of the city of [[Palembang]] and the surrounding area in South Sumatra. It is the second most well-known cuisine from [[Sumatra]] after [[Padang cuisine|Padang]]. Palembang cuisine primarily uses [[freshwater fish]] and [[prawn]]s as key ingredients due to the paramount role of the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]] for the area. Popular freshwater fish includes ''patin'' (''[[Pangasius pangasius|Pangasius]]''), ''baung'' (''[[Hemibagrus]]''), ''lais'' (''[[Kryptopterus cryptopterus]]''), ''lele'' ([[catfish]]), ''gabus'' ([[Snakehead (fish)|snakehead]]), ''mas'' ([[carp]]) and ''gurame'' ([[gourami]]). Historically, Palembang waters were teeming with ''belido'' ([[giant featherback]]), and it has become the city's official animal mascot. It is valued for its succulent flavour and soft texture. However, due to [[overfishing]], today the ''belido'' fish are scarce and probably already extinct in Musi river area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.liputan6.com/regional/read/3067075/tugu-ikan-belido-di-palembang-bakal-saingi-merlion-singapura|title=Tugu Ikan Belido di Palembang Bakal Saingi Merlion Singapura|last=Liputan6.com|work=liputan6.com|access-date=2018-07-18|language=id}}</ref> Because of its location that is not far from the sea, seafood such as shrimp, ''tenggiri'' ([[wahoo]]), ''kakap merah'' ([[red snapper]]) and [[Spanish mackerel]] are also popular in Palembang.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.triposo.com/loc/Palembang/eatingout/background |title=Palembang Eat and drink |website=triposo.com |access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref> Besides freshwater fish dishes, there are many variations of dishes, snacks, drinks, and sweets in Palembang cuisine.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Cuisine of South Sumatra\">\nFile:Pempek Kuah Cuko.jpg|''[[Pempek]]'' (fish cake) Kapal Selam and Kriting, simmered with Kuah Cuko\nFile:Laksan Palembang 1.jpg|''[[Laksa]] Palembang'', fish cake similar to pempek served in rich coconut milk-based soup, and sprinkled with crispy fried shallot.\nFile:A bowl of Tekwan.jpg|A bowl of ''[[Tekwan]]''\nFile:Mie Celor Palembang.jpg|''[[Mie celor]] Palembang''\n</gallery>\n\nSpices are also generally included although not as liberally as its same-island counterpart.

Pempek is basically fishcake made from deboned fish flesh and tapioca flour, which was a local adaptation of East Asian [[surimi]] fishcake making. Like most of noodle dishes of Indonesia, mie celor can trace its origin back to Chinese influences. It was popularly believed that Palembang preference of sweet flavour was due to Javanese influences that favoured palm sugar. Indeed, Palembang absorbs many [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] elements, including language and cuisine. For example, both [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Palembang Malay]] dialects refer fish as ''iwak'', and [[Pepes|cooking method employing banana leaf package]] as ''brengkes'' or ''brengkesan''.<ref name=\"Detikfood Palembang\" /> Martabak Palembang and nasi minyak which uses ghee, on the other hand, demonstrate Indian cuisine influence in the city.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Jakabaring_Aquatic_Center,_SEA_Games_2011_Palembang_1.jpg|right|thumb|Jakabaring Aquatic Center in Jakabaring Sport City complex.]]\nSouth Sumatra, especially the city of Palembang is notable as the host city [[2018 Asian Games]] along with Jakarta, the first Asian Games hold officially by two cities and the fourth host city of Asian Games in Southeast Asia after Bangkok in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.beritasatu.com/olahraga/211563/jakarta-dan-palembang-resmi-menjadi-tuan-rumah-asian-games-2018|title=Jakarta dan Palembang Resmi Menjadi Tuan Rumah Asian Games 2018|last=BeritaSatu.com|website=beritasatu.com|language=id|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> Palembang is also the main host of [[2011 Southeast Asian Games]] and hosted two matches of [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antaranews.com/berita/147065/kota-palembang-menjadi-tuan-rumah-sea-games-2011|title=Kota Palembang Menjadi Tuan Rumah SEA Games 2011|last=antaranews.com|website=Antara News|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2009/10/21/21005749/palembang.siap.gelar.pembukaan.sea.games.2011 |title=Palembang Siap Gelar Pembukaan SEA Games 2011 |author=Kompas Cyber Media |website=KOMPAS.com |language=id |access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sport.detik.com/sepakbola/liga-indonesia/d-749234/final-3-4-piala-asia-di-palembang |title=Final 3-4 Piala Asia di Palembang |website=sepakbola |access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> Sport facilities have been build across the city since 1971 to host ''Pekan Olahraga Mahasiswa'' (POM) IX, although the city's main sport complex, [[Jakabaring Sport City]] started its construction in 1998 and expanded later in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palembangdalamsketsa.com/2012/07/pekan-olah-raga-mahasiswa-ix-palembang.html |title=Pekan Olah Raga Mahasiswa IX Palembang Tahun 1971 |last=Sketsa |first=Diposting oleh Palembang Dalam |access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sumber.com/component/k2/sumber/stadion-jakabaring.html |title=Stadion Jakabaring |last=Wahyudi |first=Rendra |date=2017-04-27 |website=sumber.com |language=id-ID |access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> In order to keep the sport complex in frequent use, several plans have been raised by the government to encourage more sporting events into the city, including the purchase of an association football club, Persijatim Solo F.C in 2004 which then renamed to [[Sriwijaya F.C.]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/id/features/mengapa-klub-klub-indonesia-mudah-pindah-dan-berganti-nama |title=Mengapa Klub-Klub Indonesia Mudah Pindah dan Berganti Nama? |date=2016-04-13 |work=FourFourTwo |access-date=2018-05-06 |language=id-ID}}</ref> Palembang also planned to build a [[race track]] inside the complex to host a [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] race in the city.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.liputan6.com/bola/read/3207966/palembang-optimistis-jadi-tuan-rumah-motogp-2019 |title=Palembang Optimistis Jadi Tuan Rumah MotoGP 2019 |author=Liputan6.com |access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Association football|Football]] is regarded as the most popular sport in South Sumatra.

David Crosby appears on one track, and [[Jerry Garcia]] plays on three tracks, two of which also feature [[Mickey Hart]].\n\nThe album included a lavish 12-page full-color, full-size (12 sq.in.) booklet, containing photographs of the band throughout the period covered by the compilation. It also contained a detailed history of the band, written by Patrick Snyder of [[Rolling Stone]] magazine.\n\n''Flight Log'' was first reissued on CD by BMG Japan on October 22, 2008 as a part of the \"Paper Sleeve Collection\" reissue series (BVCM-35468-9). The release features an exact reproduction of the Grunt 1977 edition of the LP packaging including a reduced scale reproduction of the original booklet and inner sleeve jackets for the CDs.  Also included is a second booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The only omission by BMG Japan was not reproducing the original GRUNT label on the CDs. The audio quality is as good as the original master tapes available for the Japanese LP pressing and features JVC K2 24 Bit Remastering. However, it sounds as if the master tapes had been damaged on at least three songs, and significantly obvious on the introduction of \"Silver Spoon\". CD 1 contains Side A and B, and CD 2 contains Side C and D.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, BGO Records released a remastered edition of Flight Log in a standard jewel case with cardboard slip cover. The BGO version is said to be a sonic improvement on the BMG/Sony edition, nonetheless, certain tape defects such as on Silver Spoon still exist.\n\n==Track listing (with artist)==\n{{tracklist\n|

It remained an open-top furnace and did not have the ability to use the off-gases\u2014mainly carbon monoxide\u2014as a fuel for boilers or to heat the blast. It was thus more costly to operate than it should have been. The furnace only had one stove and so was not capable of applying the hot-blast continuously. It produced relatively expensive iron; in 1865 the landed cost of imported pig-iron was \u00a35 per ton, while that made at the works cost \u00a35 17s 6d.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nThere were problems with the operation of the blast furnace itself. Soon after operation commenced, deposits\u2014referred to as 'scaffolding'\u2014began to build up inside the furnace and these gradually increased in thickness, restricting the space inside the furnace.<ref name=\":26\" /> The rate of production declined accordingly, falling to just 26 tons per week at the end.<ref name=\":26\" />\n\nThe coal would not coke and so it was being charged directly into the blast furnace. The coal was referred to as 'anthracite', perhaps because it was hard to ignite and would not form coke, or perhaps because anthracite coal had been used in other hot-blast blast furnaces without coking.

He also had the lower part of the furnace\u2014cracked and damaged during the previous furnace campaign\u2014repaired, in late 1868.

There had been no significant amount of pig-iron smelted from ore in N.S.W. since 1882, and this tariff was an incentive to resume local production of pig-iron.

It remained an open-top furnace and did not have the ability to use the off-gases\u2014mainly carbon monoxide\u2014as a fuel for boilers or to heat the blast. It was thus more costly to operate than it should have been. The furnace only had one stove and so was not capable of applying the hot-blast continuously. It produced relatively expensive iron; in 1865 the landed cost of imported pig-iron was \u00a35 per ton, while that made at the works cost \u00a35 17s 6d.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nThere were problems with the operation of the blast furnace itself.

From 1 January 1893, the N.S.W. colonial government imposed a duty of 10 shillings per ton on imported pig-iron. There had been no significant amount of pig-iron smelted from ore in N.S.W. since 1882, and this tariff was an incentive to resume local production of pig-iron. The N.S.W. iron and steel industry benefitted from the influence of [[Protectionist Party|N.S.W politicians advocating protection]] \u2014such as [[George Dibbs]], [[William Lyne]] and [[John See]]\u2014over [[Free Trade Party|those advocating free-trade]] \u2014such as [[George Reid]]\u2014especially as the cost of locally rolled iron fell below the cost of imports for some types of wrought iron products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article156618090|title=ESKBANK IRONWORKS.|date=18 January 1894|work=National Advocate (Bathurst, NSW : 1889 - 1954)|access-date=1 June 2019|pages=2}}</ref><ref name=\":46\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13886459|title=THE IRON INDUSTRY.|date=1892-11-17|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=1 June 2019|pages=8}}</ref><ref name=\":47\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13910279|title=ESKBANK IRONWORKS.|date=16 January 1894|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=1 June 2019|pages=6}}</ref> N.S.W entered the new [[Commonwealth of Australia]] as the only state with a large scale iron and steel industry,<ref name=\":47\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14307744|title=PROTECTIONIST DELEGATES' VISIT TO LITHGOW.|date=25 April 1900|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=1 June 2019|pages=10}}</ref> and it remained so for the first four decades of the 20th-Century.\n\nThe change in government policy toward industry protection came far too late to assist the Fitzroy Iron Works, which had first proven that iron of a good quality could be made from local iron ore.<ref name=\":46\" /> The hard-won experience of Fitzroy Iron Works influenced later thinking on the siting of iron and steel works close to [[coking coal]] deposits and transport.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13256346|title=IRON; ITS MANUFACTURE; WHERE TO MAKE IT; AND HOW TO MAKE IT PAY.|date=24 April 1872|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=30 June 2019|pages=6}}</ref>\n\nThe Fitzroy Iron Works is commemorated by a memorial erected in 1948 at the site of the blast furnace<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22677975|title=Pioneers of Steel|date=23 October 1948|work=Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)|access-date=16 April 2019|pages=7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/technology/industry/display/22141-centenary-of-iron-smelting-works|title=Centenary of Iron Smelting Works|work=Monument Australia|access-date=3 May 2019}}</ref> and the remains of the iron works uncovered in 2004 with interpretive signage.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe only complete structure that is a remnant of the iron works is 'Ironstone Cottage', a sandstone cottage on the Old Hume Highway, which was once used by managers of the iron works.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Chalybeate Spring, Mittagong#Significance|The Chalybeate Spring and iron ore deposit at Mittagong]]\n* [[Lal Lal Iron Mine and Smelting Works]]\u2014 another 19th century iron mine and blast furnace, in Victoria.\n* [[Lithgow Blast Furnace#History|Lithgow Blast Furnace]]\u2014another 19th century blast furnace in New South Wales\n*[[Bogolong iron mine and blast furnace|Bogolong Iron Mine and Blast Furnace]] - another 19th century blast furnace in New South Wales\n*[[British and Tasmanian Charcoal Iron Company]]\u2014another 19th century iron mine and blast furnace, in Tasmania.\n*[[Tamar Hematite Iron Company]]\u2014another 19th century iron mine and blast furnace, in Tasmania.\n*[[Ilfracombe Iron Company]]\u2014another 19th century iron mine and blast furnace, in Tasmania.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Else-Mitchell|first=R.|title=Early Industries in the Mittagong District|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21523521|year=1981|publisher=Berrima District Historical Society|location=|isbn=0-9598208-7-6|pages=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=McKillop|first=R.
