Ice Cube wrote Dr. Dre's and Eazy-E's rhymes for the group's landmark album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. However, towards the end of 1989, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group's manager, [[Jerry Heller]], after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.<ref name=\"Ice Cube 2002\"/>\n\nIce Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both ''Straight Outta Compton'', and Eazy-E's solo album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'', but he was only paid $32,000 and his contract did not confirm that he was an official member of N.W.A.<ref name=\"Attitude70\">''Ice Cube: Attitude'', Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref>  This led Ice Cube to leave the group and bring a private lawsuit against Jerry Heller, which was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"Attitude70\"/> In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', and on their next and final album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]''.\n\n===1989\u2013present: Solo career===\nIn early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', in New York with [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team). It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in [[John Singleton]]'s violent crime drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nHis second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' (\"a vision of where we are today\") and the 'Life Side' (\"a vision of where we need to go\"). It features \"[[No Vaseline]]\", a scathing response to N.W.A<nowiki>'s ''100 Miles and Runnin''</nowiki> as well as \"Black Korea,\" a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska.]]\nIce Cube released his third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]], in the first single, \"[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]\", he rapped \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel\". ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included \"[[It Was a Good Day]]\" and \"[[Check Yo Self]]\", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including \"[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]\", \"[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]\", \"[[You Know How We Do It]]\" & \"What Can I Do?\". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, [[Mack 10]], [[Mr. Short Khop]], [[Kausion]], and [[Da Lench Mob]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Ice Cube had reunited with former N.W.A member [[Dr. Dre]], who was now part of [[Death Row Records]], in their duet \"Natural Born Killaz\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> In 1998, he released his long-awaited fifth solo album, ''[[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)]]''.

Some of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 1990s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before his death in March 1995.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of ''Bow Down''. \"Gangsta Nation\" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.\n\n===1992\u2013present: Collaborations===\nIn 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.\n\nIn 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track \"Last Wordz\" with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song \"Two To The Head\" from the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album \"Live And Let Die\". He also collaborated with [[David Bowie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]] for a remix of Bowie's \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Ice Cube appeared on the song \"[[Children of the Korn]]\" by the band [[Korn]], joining them on the [[Family Values Tour 1998]], and they also collaborated on 'Fuck Dying' from [[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)|Cube's fifth album]]. He also lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track \"Get Em Up\". Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC (rapper)|WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like \"Keep it 100\", \"80's babies\" and \"Jack and the bean stalk\". Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z. (album)|D.A.Z.]] in the song \"Iz You Ready to die\" and in [[DJ Quik]] in the song \"Boogie Till You Conk Out\" in 2011.\n\n===2004\u20132012===\n[[File:Ice cube c.jpg|thumb|right|Ice Cube performing live in Metro City Concert Club on October 29, 2010.]]\nIn 2004, he appeared in the [[Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz]] song, \"[[Real Nigga Roll Call]]\".\nIn late 2005, Ice Cube and [[R.

After launching that comeback album, Ice Cube toured across the world to promote it. The tour is known as \"Straight Outta Compton Tour\", and accompanying him is his friend and fellow rapper WC from the Westside Connection. Some places he has recently performed include the Paradiso in [[Amsterdam]] and various venues in England. After touring the U.S. and Europe, he performed all around Australia, from Sydney's [[Enmore Theatre]] to The Forum Arena in Melbourne, before heading to Japan.\n\nIce Cube collaborated with [[Tech N9ne]] on the song \"Blackboy\" that appears on Tech N9ne's July 2008 album ''[[Killer (Tech N9ne album)|Killer]]''.

Ice Cube has stated this album has a different direction than any one of his other albums. He received beats from West coast veteran producers such as [[DJ Quik]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[E-A-Ski]], and [[Sir Jinx]], not having worked on a solo album with the latter in nearly 20 years. The album was released independently under his label [[Lench Mob Records|Lench Mob]]. Ice Cube has stated that \"being independent is beautiful because we can do things 'out the box'.\" He also signed an upcoming recording artist named 7Tre The Ghost, that record companies would usually frown at. \"Instead of working from a ready-made cookie-cutter marketing plan, we can tailor make a marketing plan specifically for me.\"\n\nIn November 2011, Ice Cube stated via Twitter that he was seven songs into the current album he's recording. He also stated he \"always got an album coming out\" which suggests that he isn't thinking of rap retirement to focus on acting in the near future.\n\n===2012\u2013present: ''Everythang's Corrupt''===\nIn 2012, Ice Cube recorded a verse for a remix of the [[Insane Clown Posse]] song \"[[Chris Benoit (song)|Chris Benoit]]\", from ICP's ''[[The Mighty Death Pop!]]'' album, appearing on the album ''[[Mike E.

Ice Cube was the only member of N.W.A who is not from [[Compton, California]] (where it was formed).\n\nBy this point Ice Cube was a full-time member of N.W.A along with [[Dr. Dre]] and [[MC Ren]]. Ice Cube wrote Dr. Dre's and Eazy-E's rhymes for the group's landmark album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. However, towards the end of 1989, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group's manager, [[Jerry Heller]], after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.<ref name=\"Ice Cube 2002\"/>\n\nIce Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both ''Straight Outta Compton'', and Eazy-E's solo album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'', but he was only paid $32,000 and his contract did not confirm that he was an official member of N.W.A.<ref name=\"Attitude70\">''Ice Cube: Attitude'', Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref>  This led Ice Cube to leave the group and bring a private lawsuit against Jerry Heller, which was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"Attitude70\"/> In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', and on their next and final album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]''.\n\n===1989\u2013present: Solo career===\nIn early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', in New York with [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team). It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in [[John Singleton]]'s violent crime drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nHis second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' (\"a vision of where we are today\") and the 'Life Side' (\"a vision of where we need to go\"). It features \"[[No Vaseline]]\", a scathing response to N.W.A<nowiki>'s ''100 Miles and Runnin''</nowiki> as well as \"Black Korea,\" a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska.]]\nIce Cube released his third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]], in the first single, \"[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]\", he rapped \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel\". ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included \"[[It Was a Good Day]]\" and \"[[Check Yo Self]]\", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including \"[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]\", \"[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]\", \"[[You Know How We Do It]]\" & \"What Can I Do?\". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, [[Mack 10]], [[Mr. Short Khop]], [[Kausion]], and [[Da Lench Mob]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Ice Cube had reunited with former N.W.A member [[Dr. Dre]], who was now part of [[Death Row Records]], in their duet \"Natural Born Killaz\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> In 1998, he released his long-awaited fifth solo album, ''[[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)]]''.

Some of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 1990s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before his death in March 1995.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of ''Bow Down''. \"Gangsta Nation\" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.\n\n===1992\u2013present: Collaborations===\nIn 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.\n\nIn 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track \"Last Wordz\" with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song \"Two To The Head\" from the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album \"Live And Let Die\". He also collaborated with [[David Bowie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]] for a remix of Bowie's \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Ice Cube appeared on the song \"[[Children of the Korn]]\" by the band [[Korn]], joining them on the [[Family Values Tour 1998]], and they also collaborated on 'Fuck Dying' from [[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)|Cube's fifth album]]. He also lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track \"Get Em Up\". Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC (rapper)|WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like \"Keep it 100\", \"80's babies\" and \"Jack and the bean stalk\". Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z.

Also in the cast are [[Dabney Coleman]], [[Fred Willard]], [[Richard Benjamin]], [[Eddie Albert]], Scott Elliott, [[Cathryn Damon]], and a cameo by Jane Curtin's fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' co-star [[Garrett Morris]]. The film was released in summer of 1980, grossing approximately US$7.5 million.\n\nThis was the final [[American International Pictures]] production before its merger with [[Filmways]].\n\n==Plot==\nJane ([[Susan Saint James]]), Elaine ([[Jane Curtin]]), and Louise ([[Jessica Lange]]) are suburbanites in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. These three women, friends since high school, are currently all struggling with money.\n\nJane is divorced, trying to cope with the man she is dating, Robert ([[Fred Willard]]), her newly single father ([[Eddie Albert]]), who moves in with Jane after his wife leaves him for another woman, and her young children, who need dental work. Jane learns she is pregnant, which makes Robert unhappy since both he and Jane are nearly broke.\n\nElaine's husband, an architect, has left her for a younger woman. He has also left her with no money, no credit cards, and lots of bills, all of which are very overdue, leading to a scene with a man at the power company ([[Garrett Morris]]). Depressed, she gets drunk and her car is pulled over by police officer Jack ([[Dabney Coleman]]). Elaine makes a pass at him, trying to get out of the ticket. When he accepts, then reveals he is married, Elaine smacks him with her purse. She makes it clear that if she is arrested by Jack, her one phone call will be to his wife.\n\nLouise owns an antiques store. Unfortunately, it is not a very successful operation, so she is always accepting funds from her veterinarian husband ([[Richard Benjamin]]) to keep the store open. While they are in bed one evening, in the early process of making love, the doorbell rings. Louise is served a court order and learns her husband plans on suing her to force her into bankruptcy to wipe away the enormous debt she has incurred.\n\nThe women become desperate. Elaine even tries a yard sale to raise money, selling her husband's possessions, including his deodorant. With nowhere else to turn, Jane, Elaine and Louise notice a \"money ball\" at the mall, filled with cash, and hatch a scheme to pull off a daring robbery by land and by sea.\n\nAt the peak of their woes, Elaine visits the local mall, where an acquaintance ([[Cathryn Damon]]) has coaxed her into helping out with staging a community pageant. Elaine stares at a large, clear ball soon due to hold thousands of dollars in a giant cash \"give away\" and formulates the idea of stealing the money. She calls Jane and Louise to the mall, where they scheme to steal the money by drilling a hole beneath the ball and sucking out as much cash as possible with a high-powered vacuum, then escaping via the river behind the mall.\n\nDespite getting caught by officer Jack in the act of stealing items needed for the heist, Elaine again manages to sweet-talk her way out of being taken to jail. On the evening of the heist, each woman has an unexpected distraction, but finally find their way to the mall. Jane and Louise go to work beneath the cash ball while Elaine readies herself to throw the switch to the mall's lighting controls, aiding their escape. Unfortunately, a minor occurrence nearly causes mall security to notice the noise caused by Jane and Louise stealing the money. With no other way to distract the guards and shoppers, Elaine begins to rant about the high cost of living and how so many things cost \"the shirt off your back -- and even THAT'S not enough!\" She begins an impromptu striptease, exposing her bosom to the crowd.\n\nAn indoor light pole falls directly into the ball, sending cash flowing out into the mall, driving people into a frenzy to collect it. During the uproar above, Jane and Louise make their escape to the river with two large trash bags filled with cash, only to have their canoe tip over when Louise stands up. They both fall in, and Louise can't swim, leaving Jane to decide to save the cash or her friend. She saves Louise and the two bags float away.\n\nHours later, the sun is rising and both Jane and Louise are still on the bank of the river, crestfallen over the loss of the money, joined by Elaine, wrapped in a blanket. The three begin to argue, but Louise notices a bag floating by and all three of them dive in after it.\n\nAt the film's end, Jane has married Robert and gotten her father a condo in a senior's complex; Louise reopens her store and takes back her husband, whom she had left; and Elaine begins dating the officer, with enough secret money to bring her back to the lifestyle she had been accustomed to.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Susan Saint James]] as Jane\n* [[Jane Curtin]] as Elaine\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Louise\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Jack Heintzel\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Albert\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Robert\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Max\n* [[Cathryn Damon]] as Natalie\n}}\n\n==Production==\nRobert Kaufman had written the script in 1971\u20131972,<ref name=kramerL-1979-08-23>{{citation |author=Kramer, Linda |title=Another Big Scene In Eugene |publisher=Associated Press |journal=Eugene Register-Guard |date=August 23, 1979 }}</ref> and Kaufman (and then later with Jere Henshaw) had [[20th Century Fox]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[Universal Pictures]], all interested in the project if he could land major stars.

Unfortunately, it is not a very successful operation, so she is always accepting funds from her veterinarian husband ([[Richard Benjamin]]) to keep the store open. While they are in bed one evening, in the early process of making love, the doorbell rings. Louise is served a court order and learns her husband plans on suing her to force her into bankruptcy to wipe away the enormous debt she has incurred.\n\nThe women become desperate. Elaine even tries a yard sale to raise money, selling her husband's possessions, including his deodorant. With nowhere else to turn, Jane, Elaine and Louise notice a \"money ball\" at the mall, filled with cash, and hatch a scheme to pull off a daring robbery by land and by sea.\n\nAt the peak of their woes, Elaine visits the local mall, where an acquaintance ([[Cathryn Damon]]) has coaxed her into helping out with staging a community pageant. Elaine stares at a large, clear ball soon due to hold thousands of dollars in a giant cash \"give away\" and formulates the idea of stealing the money. She calls Jane and Louise to the mall, where they scheme to steal the money by drilling a hole beneath the ball and sucking out as much cash as possible with a high-powered vacuum, then escaping via the river behind the mall.\n\nDespite getting caught by officer Jack in the act of stealing items needed for the heist, Elaine again manages to sweet-talk her way out of being taken to jail. On the evening of the heist, each woman has an unexpected distraction, but finally find their way to the mall. Jane and Louise go to work beneath the cash ball while Elaine readies herself to throw the switch to the mall's lighting controls, aiding their escape. Unfortunately, a minor occurrence nearly causes mall security to notice the noise caused by Jane and Louise stealing the money. With no other way to distract the guards and shoppers, Elaine begins to rant about the high cost of living and how so many things cost \"the shirt off your back -- and even THAT'S not enough!\" She begins an impromptu striptease, exposing her bosom to the crowd.\n\nAn indoor light pole falls directly into the ball, sending cash flowing out into the mall, driving people into a frenzy to collect it. During the uproar above, Jane and Louise make their escape to the river with two large trash bags filled with cash, only to have their canoe tip over when Louise stands up. They both fall in, and Louise can't swim, leaving Jane to decide to save the cash or her friend. She saves Louise and the two bags float away.\n\nHours later, the sun is rising and both Jane and Louise are still on the bank of the river, crestfallen over the loss of the money, joined by Elaine, wrapped in a blanket. The three begin to argue, but Louise notices a bag floating by and all three of them dive in after it.\n\nAt the film's end, Jane has married Robert and gotten her father a condo in a senior's complex; Louise reopens her store and takes back her husband, whom she had left; and Elaine begins dating the officer, with enough secret money to bring her back to the lifestyle she had been accustomed to.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Susan Saint James]] as Jane\n* [[Jane Curtin]] as Elaine\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Louise\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Jack Heintzel\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Albert\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Robert\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Max\n* [[Cathryn Damon]] as Natalie\n}}\n\n==Production==\nRobert Kaufman had written the script in 1971\u20131972,<ref name=kramerL-1979-08-23>{{citation |author=Kramer, Linda |title=Another Big Scene In Eugene |publisher=Associated Press |journal=Eugene Register-Guard |date=August 23, 1979 }}</ref> and Kaufman (and then later with Jere Henshaw) had [[20th Century Fox]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[Universal Pictures]], all interested in the project if he could land major stars.

The hat-check girl, Mildred Atkinson ([[Martha Stewart (actor)|Martha Stewart]]), is engrossed in reading the copy meant for Dix; since she only has a few pages left to go, she asks to finish before passing it on to Dix.  Dix has a second violent outburst when a young director bad-mouths Dix's friend Charlie ([[Robert Warwick]]), a washed-up actor.\n\nDix claims to be too tired to read the novel, so he asks Mildred to go home with him, ostensibly to explain the plot. As they enter the courtyard of his apartment, they pass a new tenant, Laurel Gray ([[Gloria Grahame]]); Dix and Laurel are clearly intrigued by each other.  As soon as Mildred is convinced that Dix is not trying to seduce her, she describes the story, in the process confirming what he had suspected\u2014the book is trash. He gives her cab fare to get home.\n\nThe next morning, he is awakened by an old army buddy who is now a police detective, Brub Nicolai ([[Frank Lovejoy]]), who takes him downtown to be questioned by Captain Lochner ([[Carl Benton Reid]]). The coat check girl Mildred was murdered during the night and Dix is a suspect. Laurel is brought to the police station, she confirms seeing the girl leave Dix's apartment alone and unharmed but Lochner is still deeply suspicious. Although Dix shows no overt sympathy for the dead victim, on the way home from the police station, he anonymously sends her two dozen white roses.\n\n[[File:LonelyPlaceTrailer.jpg|thumb|250px|Laurel takes a frightening ride with Dix]]\nWhen he gets home, Dix checks up on Laurel. He finds she is an aspiring actress with only a few low-budget films to her credit. They begin to fall in love and, with Laurel assisting him, Dix finds new energy and goes back to work with enthusiasm, much to his agent's delight. \n\nDix remains notoriously erratic, however; sometimes he  behaves strangely. He says things that make his agent Mel and Brub's wife Sylvia ([[Jeff Donnell]]<!--per billing-->) wonder if he did kill the girl. Lochner sows seeds of doubt in Laurel's mind, pointing out Dix's long record of violent behavior. When he learns about this, and that Laurel has not told him of her meeting with Lochner, Dix becomes furious and irrational. With her a terrified passenger, he drives at high speed until they sideswipe another car. Nobody is hurt in the collision, but when the other driver accosts him, Dix beats him unconscious and is about to strike him with a large rock when Laurel stops him.\n\nLaurel gets to the point where she cannot sleep without taking pills. Her distrust and fear of Dix are becoming too much for her. When he asks her to marry him, she accepts, but only because she is too scared of what he might do if she'd refused. She secretly makes a plane reservation and tells Mel she is leaving because she cannot take it anymore. Dix finds out and becomes violent, almost strangling her before he regains control of himself. Just then the phone rings. It is Brub with good news: Mildred's boyfriend (named Henry Kesler, the same as the film's [[associate producer]]) has confessed to her murder. It is too late, however, to salvage Dix and Laurel's relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Dixon Steele\n* [[Gloria Grahame]] as Laurel Gray\n* [[Frank Lovejoy]] as Det.

North]] adapted the story, he stuck close to the original source and [[John Derek]] was considered for the role of Dix because in the novel the character was much younger. North's treatment was not used. Andrew Solt developed the screenplay with regular input from producer Robert Lord and director [[Nicholas Ray]], and the end result is far different from the source novel. Solt claimed that Bogart loved the script so much that he wanted to make it without revisions&nbsp;\u2013 Solt maintains that the final cut is very close to his script&nbsp;\u2013 but further research shows that Ray made regular rewrites, some added on the day of shooting. In fact, only four pages of the 140-page script had no revisions. The film was produced by Bogart's [[Santana Productions]] company, whose first film was ''[[Knock on Any Door]]'' (1949), which was directed by Ray and starred Bogart and Derek in the leading roles.\n\n[[Louise Brooks]] wrote in her essay \"Humphrey and Bogey\" that she felt it was the role of Dixon Steele in this movie that came closest to the real Bogart she knew. \"Before inertia set in, he played one fascinatingly complex character, craftily directed by Nicholas Ray, in a film whose title perfectly defined Humphrey's own isolation among people. ''In a Lonely Place'' gave him a role that he could play with complexity because the character's pride in his art, his selfishness, his drunkenness, his lack of energy stabbed with lightning strokes of violence, were shared equally by the real Bogart.\"<ref>[http://www.psykickgirl.com/lulu/bogey.html Brooks, Louise].  ''Sight and Sound,'' Winter 1966/67, Volume 36 Number 1, \"Humphrey and Bogey.\" Last accessed: January 20, 2008.</ref> Apparently, on one voyage in their yacht Santana, Bogart showed an inexplicable burst of rage that frightened his wife [[Lauren Bacall]].\n\nThe original ending had Dix strangling Laurel to death in the heat of their argument. Sgt. Nicolai comes to tell Dix that he has been cleared of Mildred's murder but arrests him for killing Laurel. Dix tells Brub that he is finally finished with his screenplay; the final shot was to be of a page in the typewriter which has the significant lines Dix said to Laurel in the car (which he admitted to not knowing where to put) \"I was born when she kissed me, I died when she left me, I lived a few weeks while she loved me\". This scene was filmed halfway through the shooting schedule, but Ray hated the ending he had helped write. Ray later said, \"I just couldn't believe the ending that Bundy (screenwriter Andrew Solt) and I had written. I shot it because it was my obligation to do it. Then I kicked everybody off stage except Bogart, Art Smith and Gloria. And we improvised the ending as it is now. In the original ending we had ribbons so it was all tied up into a very neat package, with Lovejoy coming in and arresting him as he was writing the last lines, having killed Gloria. Huh! And I thought, shit, I can't do it, I just can't do it! Romances don't have to end that way. Marriages don't have to end that way, they don't have to end in violence. Let the audience make up its own mind what's going to happen to Bogie when he goes outside the apartment.\"<ref>Eisenschitz, Bernard. \"Nicholas Ray: An American Journey\" (Great Britain: Faber and Faber Limited, 1993) page 144.</ref>\n\nBacall and [[Ginger Rogers]] were considered for the role of Laurel Gray. Bacall was a natural choice given her off-screen marriage to Bogart and their box-office appeal, but Warner Bros. refused to loan her out, a move often thought to be in reaction to Bogart having set up his own independent production company, the type of which Warner Bros. were afraid would jeopardize the future of the major studios. Rogers was the producers' first choice but Ray believed that his wife Gloria Grahame was right for the part. Even though their marriage was troubled, he insisted that she be cast. Her performance today is unanimously considered to be among her finest.\n\nGrahame and Ray's marriage was starting to come apart during filming. Grahame was forced to sign a contract stipulating that \"my husband [Ray] shall be entitled to direct, control, advise, instruct and even command my actions during the hours from 9 AM to 6 PM, every day except Sunday ... I acknowledge that in every conceivable situation his will and judgment shall be considered superior to mine and shall prevail.\" Grahame was also forbidden to \"nag, cajole, tease or in any other feminine fashion seek to distract or influence him.\" The two did separate during filming. Afraid that one of them would be replaced, Ray took to sleeping in a dressing room, lying and saying that he needed to work on the script. Grahame played along with the charade and nobody knew that they had separated. Though there was a brief reconciliation, the couple divorced in 1952.<ref>Lentz, Robert J. (2011).

The production began on October 25, 1949 and ended on December 1, 1949.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nAt the time of its original release, the reviews were generally positive (in particular many critics praised Bogart and Grahame's performances), but many questioned the marketability given the bleak ending.\nThe staff at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine in May 1950 gave the film a good review and wrote, \"''In a Lonely Place'' Humphrey Bogart has a sympathetic role though cast as one always ready to mix it with his dukes. He favors the underdog; in one instance he virtually has a veteran, brandy-soaking character actor (out of work) on his very limited payroll ... Director Nicholas Ray maintains nice suspense. Bogart is excellent. Gloria Grahame, as his romance, also rates kudos\".<ref>[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117791920.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 ''Variety''] Film review, May 17, 1950.

Humphrey Bogart is in top form in his latest independently made production, ''In a Lonely Place,'' and the picture itself is a superior cut of melodrama. Playing a violent, quick-tempered Hollywood movie writer suspected of murder, Mr. Bogart looms large on the screen of the Paramount Theatre and he moves flawlessly through a script which is almost as flinty as the actor himself. Andrew Solt, who fashioned the screenplay from a story by Dorothy B. Hughes and an adaptation by Edmund H. North, has had the good sense to resolve the story logically. Thus Dixon Steele remains as much of an enigma, an explosive, contradictory force at loose ends when the film ends as when it starts.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F07E3DB1539E13BBC4052DFB366838B649EDE Crowther, Bosley].

When I first saw ''In a Lonely Place'' as a teenager, it frightened me and yet attracted me with an almost hypnotic power. Later, I came to understand why. Occasionally, very rarely, a movie feels so heartfelt, so emotional, so revealing that it seems as though both the actor and the director are standing naked before the audience. When that kind of marriage happens between actor and director, it's breathtaking.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E5DD1F3FF936A25751C1A9669C8B63 Lyman, Rick].

Last accessed: July 6, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Comparisons to novel==\n''In a Lonely Place'' was based on the 1947 novel of the same name by [[Dorothy B. Hughes]]. Some controversy exists between admirers of the film and admirers of the novel (who view the film as a watered down adaptation), as Edmund H. North's script takes some elements of the novel but is ultimately a different story. Hughes was not bothered by the changes made by North and praised Grahame's performance as Laurel.\n\nThe strongest difference between the two works lies in the protagonist; the film's Dixon Steele is a screenwriter with an unconventional life and a decent person with fatally poor impulse control, prone to wild overreaction when enraged. The novel's Steele is a limited third-person view from Dix's perspective, reminiscent of the first-person in noir, \u00e0 la ''[[The Killer Inside Me]]''.  Steele is a charlatan who pretends to be a novelist while sponging money from his overbearing uncle. When this well dries up, he murders a wealthy young man and assumes his identity, in a manner similar to [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s [[Tom Ripley]]. (Hughes' character pre-dates Ripley and may have influenced him.) The film follows the question of whether Dix finally went too far in his anger and committed the murder to a tragic end: even though he is proved innocent, his rage at the cloud of suspicion has driven the woman he loves away for good. No question of Dix's innocence exists in the novel, which follows the investigation of a murder Dix plainly committed and his interference in the investigation for his own ends.\n\nCurtis Hanson, in the DVD featurette 'In A Lonely Place Revisited', further analyses the parallels and differences between the novel and the film. He notes that there is a parallel in the film between Dix's adaptation of a novel for film and the adaptation of ''In a Lonely Place'' for film he also notes that a difference between Dix in the film and Dix in the novel is their respective treatment of women. In the novel Dix pursues women and the first chapter details his pursuit of a woman.

The hat-check girl, Mildred Atkinson ([[Martha Stewart (actor)|Martha Stewart]]), is engrossed in reading the copy meant for Dix; since she only has a few pages left to go, she asks to finish before passing it on to Dix.  Dix has a second violent outburst when a young director bad-mouths Dix's friend Charlie ([[Robert Warwick]]), a washed-up actor.\n\nDix claims to be too tired to read the novel, so he asks Mildred to go home with him, ostensibly to explain the plot. As they enter the courtyard of his apartment, they pass a new tenant, Laurel Gray ([[Gloria Grahame]]); Dix and Laurel are clearly intrigued by each other.  As soon as Mildred is convinced that Dix is not trying to seduce her, she describes the story, in the process confirming what he had suspected\u2014the book is trash. He gives her cab fare to get home.\n\nThe next morning, he is awakened by an old army buddy who is now a police detective, Brub Nicolai ([[Frank Lovejoy]]), who takes him downtown to be questioned by Captain Lochner ([[Carl Benton Reid]]). The coat check girl Mildred was murdered during the night and Dix is a suspect. Laurel is brought to the police station, she confirms seeing the girl leave Dix's apartment alone and unharmed but Lochner is still deeply suspicious. Although Dix shows no overt sympathy for the dead victim, on the way home from the police station, he anonymously sends her two dozen white roses.\n\n[[File:LonelyPlaceTrailer.jpg|thumb|250px|Laurel takes a frightening ride with Dix]]\nWhen he gets home, Dix checks up on Laurel. He finds she is an aspiring actress with only a few low-budget films to her credit. They begin to fall in love and, with Laurel assisting him, Dix finds new energy and goes back to work with enthusiasm, much to his agent's delight. \n\nDix remains notoriously erratic, however; sometimes he  behaves strangely. He says things that make his agent Mel and Brub's wife Sylvia ([[Jeff Donnell]]<!--per billing-->) wonder if he did kill the girl. Lochner sows seeds of doubt in Laurel's mind, pointing out Dix's long record of violent behavior. When he learns about this, and that Laurel has not told him of her meeting with Lochner, Dix becomes furious and irrational. With her a terrified passenger, he drives at high speed until they sideswipe another car. Nobody is hurt in the collision, but when the other driver accosts him, Dix beats him unconscious and is about to strike him with a large rock when Laurel stops him.\n\nLaurel gets to the point where she cannot sleep without taking pills. Her distrust and fear of Dix are becoming too much for her. When he asks her to marry him, she accepts, but only because she is too scared of what he might do if she'd refused. She secretly makes a plane reservation and tells Mel she is leaving because she cannot take it anymore. Dix finds out and becomes violent, almost strangling her before he regains control of himself. Just then the phone rings. It is Brub with good news: Mildred's boyfriend (named Henry Kesler, the same as the film's [[associate producer]]) has confessed to her murder. Tragically, it is too late to salvage Dix and Laurel's relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Dixon Steele\n* [[Gloria Grahame]] as Laurel Gray\n* [[Frank Lovejoy]] as Det.

North]] adapted the story, he stuck close to the original source and [[John Derek]] was considered for the role of Dix because in the novel the character was much younger. North's treatment was not used. Andrew Solt developed the screenplay with regular input from producer Robert Lord and director [[Nicholas Ray]], and the end result is far different from the source novel. Solt claimed that Bogart loved the script so much that he wanted to make it without revisions&nbsp;\u2013 Solt maintains that the final cut is very close to his script&nbsp;\u2013 but further research shows that Ray made regular rewrites, some added on the day of shooting. In fact, only four pages of the 140-page script had no revisions. The film was produced by Bogart's [[Santana Productions]] company, whose first film was ''[[Knock on Any Door]]'' (1949), which was directed by Ray and starred Bogart and Derek in the leading roles.\n\n[[Louise Brooks]] wrote in her essay \"Humphrey and Bogey\" that she felt it was the role of Dixon Steele in this movie that came closest to the real Bogart she knew. \"Before inertia set in, he played one fascinatingly complex character, craftily directed by Nicholas Ray, in a film whose title perfectly defined Humphrey's own isolation among people. ''In a Lonely Place'' gave him a role that he could play with complexity because the character's pride in his art, his selfishness, his drunkenness, his lack of energy stabbed with lightning strokes of violence, were shared equally by the real Bogart.\"<ref>[http://www.psykickgirl.com/lulu/bogey.html Brooks, Louise].  ''Sight and Sound,'' Winter 1966/67, Volume 36 Number 1, \"Humphrey and Bogey.\" Last accessed: January 20, 2008.</ref> Apparently, on one voyage in their yacht Santana, Bogart showed an inexplicable burst of rage that frightened his wife [[Lauren Bacall]].\n\nThe original ending had Dix strangling Laurel to death in the heat of their argument. Sgt. Nicolai comes to tell Dix that he has been cleared of Mildred's murder but arrests him for killing Laurel. Dix tells Brub that he is finally finished with his screenplay; the final shot was to be of a page in the typewriter which has the significant lines Dix said to Laurel in the car (which he admitted to not knowing where to put) \"I was born when she kissed me, I died when she left me, I lived a few weeks while she loved me\". This scene was filmed halfway through the shooting schedule, but Ray hated the ending he had helped write. Ray later said, \"I just couldn't believe the ending that Bundy (screenwriter Andrew Solt) and I had written. I shot it because it was my obligation to do it. Then I kicked everybody off stage except Bogart, Art Smith and Gloria. And we improvised the ending as it is now. In the original ending we had ribbons so it was all tied up into a very neat package, with Lovejoy coming in and arresting him as he was writing the last lines, having killed Gloria. Huh! And I thought, shit, I can't do it, I just can't do it! Romances don't have to end that way. Marriages don't have to end that way, they don't have to end in violence. Let the audience make up its own mind what's going to happen to Bogie when he goes outside the apartment.\"<ref>Eisenschitz, Bernard. \"Nicholas Ray: An American Journey\" (Great Britain: Faber and Faber Limited, 1993) page 144.</ref>\n\nBacall and [[Ginger Rogers]] were considered for the role of Laurel Gray. Bacall was a natural choice given her off-screen marriage to Bogart and their box-office appeal, but Warner Bros. refused to loan her out, a move often thought to be in reaction to Bogart having set up his own independent production company, the type of which Warner Bros. were afraid would jeopardize the future of the major studios. Rogers was the producers' first choice but Ray believed that his wife Gloria Grahame was right for the part. Even though their marriage was troubled, he insisted that she be cast. Her performance today is unanimously considered to be among her finest.\n\nGrahame and Ray's marriage was starting to come apart during filming. Grahame was forced to sign a contract stipulating that \"my husband [Ray] shall be entitled to direct, control, advise, instruct and even command my actions during the hours from 9 AM to 6 PM, every day except Sunday ... I acknowledge that in every conceivable situation his will and judgment shall be considered superior to mine and shall prevail.\" Grahame was also forbidden to \"nag, cajole, tease or in any other feminine fashion seek to distract or influence him.\" The two did separate during filming. Afraid that one of them would be replaced, Ray took to sleeping in a dressing room, lying and saying that he needed to work on the script. Grahame played along with the charade and nobody knew that they had separated. Though there was a brief reconciliation, the couple divorced in 1952.<ref>Lentz, Robert J. (2011).

The production began on October 25, 1949 and ended on December 1, 1949.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nAt the time of its original release, the reviews were generally positive (in particular many critics praised Bogart and Grahame's performances), but many questioned the marketability given the bleak ending.\nThe staff at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine in May 1950 gave the film a good review and wrote, \"''In a Lonely Place'' Humphrey Bogart has a sympathetic role though cast as one always ready to mix it with his dukes. He favors the underdog; in one instance he virtually has a veteran, brandy-soaking character actor (out of work) on his very limited payroll ... Director Nicholas Ray maintains nice suspense. Bogart is excellent. Gloria Grahame, as his romance, also rates kudos\".<ref>[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117791920.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 ''Variety''] Film review, May 17, 1950.

Humphrey Bogart is in top form in his latest independently made production, ''In a Lonely Place,'' and the picture itself is a superior cut of melodrama. Playing a violent, quick-tempered Hollywood movie writer suspected of murder, Mr. Bogart looms large on the screen of the Paramount Theatre and he moves flawlessly through a script which is almost as flinty as the actor himself. Andrew Solt, who fashioned the screenplay from a story by Dorothy B. Hughes and an adaptation by Edmund H. North, has had the good sense to resolve the story logically. Thus Dixon Steele remains as much of an enigma, an explosive, contradictory force at loose ends when the film ends as when it starts.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F07E3DB1539E13BBC4052DFB366838B649EDE Crowther, Bosley].

Ray's films had a brief revival in the 1970s and Bogart's anti-hero stance gained a following in the 1960s, and the French ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'' critics during the 1950s praised Ray's unique film making.

He said, \"I wanted them to see the reality of that period and to see that emotion. This movie, and I'm not saying it's the greatest movie ever made, but it represents many things that I think are worth aspiring to, such as having character and emotion be the driving force, rather than the plot. ... When I first saw ''In a Lonely Place'' as a teenager, it frightened me and yet attracted me with an almost hypnotic power. Later, I came to understand why. Occasionally, very rarely, a movie feels so heartfelt, so emotional, so revealing that it seems as though both the actor and the director are standing naked before the audience. When that kind of marriage happens between actor and director, it's breathtaking.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E5DD1F3FF936A25751C1A9669C8B63 Lyman, Rick].

Last accessed: July 6, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Comparisons to novel==\n''In a Lonely Place'' was based on the 1947 novel of the same name by [[Dorothy B. Hughes]]. Some controversy exists between admirers of the film and admirers of the novel (who view the film as a watered down adaptation), as Edmund H. North's script takes some elements of the novel but is ultimately a different story. Hughes was not bothered by the changes made by North and praised Grahame's performance as Laurel.\n\nThe strongest difference between the two works lies in the protagonist; the film's Dixon Steele is a screenwriter with an unconventional life and a decent person with fatally poor impulse control, prone to wild overreaction when enraged. The novel's Steele is a limited third-person view from Dix's perspective, reminiscent of the first-person in noir, \u00e0 la ''[[The Killer Inside Me]]''.  Steele is a charlatan who pretends to be a novelist while sponging money from his overbearing uncle. When this well dries up, he murders a wealthy young man and assumes his identity, in a manner similar to [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s [[Tom Ripley]]. (Hughes' character pre-dates Ripley and may have influenced him.) The film follows the question of whether Dix finally went too far in his anger and committed the murder to a tragic end: even though he is proved innocent, his rage at the cloud of suspicion has driven the woman he loves away for good. No question of Dix's innocence exists in the novel, which follows the investigation of a murder Dix plainly committed and his interference in the investigation for his own ends.\n\nCurtis Hanson, in the DVD featurette 'In A Lonely Place Revisited', further analyses the parallels and differences between the novel and the film. He notes that there is a parallel in the film between Dix's adaptation of a novel for film and the adaptation of ''In a Lonely Place'' for film he also notes that a difference between Dix in the film and Dix in the novel is their respective treatment of women. In the novel Dix pursues women and the first chapter details his pursuit of a woman. In the film, Dix is pursued by women.\n\nHughes' novel was out of print for decades, until re-released by The Feminist Press at CUNY in 2003, which edition was still in print in 2010. [[Penguin Books]] also published a paperback edition in the UK in 2010 as part of their Modern Classics imprint, and the Library of America included it in the first volume of their \"Women Crime Writers\" collection.

It's all about old world school of Dracula in the Bela Lugosi 1940s up against the Twilight felons with humor, It's hard to do but it's great fun. I think 'Twilight' is a wonderful series of books. It's so important for these young girls with hormonal changes and this love that's worth giving your life for. But now I have to find a way to bring my 'Love At First Bite' character into that kind of story and make it funny and not be at all like 'Twilight' and I think I found a way to do that.</blockquote>\n\nHe later elaborated about the plot:\n\n<blockquote>His [my character's] son is a sort of perennial student in California and he doesn't want to acknowledge his father, Dracula, at all and he's getting married into a family of televangelists. {Laughs} He met this girl that he's in love with who's a zoologist in a cave somewhere; he was a bat in this cave in South America.  So now, Dracula's forced himself to come to Hollywood for this big wedding and bring all of his relatives who are pretty ridiculous people.  There's a wonderful scene at the bachelor party in a strip club, it's great stuff.<ref>[http://www.thedivareview.com/My_One_and_Only_Interview.htm Interview with George Hamilton] accessed 23 December 2014</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo date, a sequel has yet to go into production.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vampire film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0079489}}\n* {{tcmdb title|22749|Love at First Bite}}\n* {{Allmovie title|30333}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=love_at_first_bite}}\n* [http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=30333 New York Times listing]\n\n{{Dracula}}\n{{Stan Dragoti}}\n\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1970s comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:1970s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American International Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American parody films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Dracula films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stan Dragoti]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Charles Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Parodies of horror]]\n[[Category:Vampire comedy films]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the Three Stooges film|Love at First Bite (1950 film)}}\n{{distinguish|Love at First Byte (disambiguation) {{!}} Love at First Byte}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Love at First Bite\n| image = love_at_first_bite.jpg\n| caption = [[Film poster|Theatrical release poster]]\n| director = [[Stan Dragoti]]\n| producer = Joel Freeman\n| writer = [[Robert Kaufman]]\n| starring = {{Plainlist|\n* [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]]\n* [[Susan Saint James]]\n* [[Richard Benjamin]]\n* [[Arte Johnson]]\n* [[Dick Shawn]]\n}}\n| music = [[Charles Bernstein (composer)|Charles Bernstein]]\n| cinematography = Edward Rosson\n| editing = Mort Fallick<br/>Allan Jacobs\n| studio  = [[Melvin Simon|Melvin Simon Productions]]\n| distributor = [[American International Pictures]]\n| released = {{Film date|1979|4|13}}\n| runtime = 94 minutes\n| country = United States\n| language = English\n| budget = $3 million<ref name=\"people\">[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20074820,00.html ''B'' is for Low Budget and Big Box Office Bucks, So Sam Arkoff is Proud to Be Called Hollywood's ''King of the B Pictures''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523225548/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20074820,00.html |date=2014-05-23 }} ''[[People (magazine)|People]] Magazine''.

In 2009, he stated:<ref>[http://www.moviehole.net/200920490-second-bite-for-hamilton Moviehole.net]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It's terrific. It's all about old world school of Dracula in the Bela Lugosi 1940s up against the Twilight felons with humor, It's hard to do but it's great fun. I think 'Twilight' is a wonderful series of books. It's so important for these young girls with hormonal changes and this love that's worth giving your life for. But now I have to find a way to bring my 'Love At First Bite' character into that kind of story and make it funny and not be at all like 'Twilight' and I think I found a way to do that.</blockquote>\n\nHe later elaborated about the plot:\n\n<blockquote>His [my character's] son is a sort of perennial student in California and he doesn't want to acknowledge his father, Dracula, at all and he's getting married into a family of televangelists. {Laughs} He met this girl that he's in love with who's a zoologist in a cave somewhere; he was a bat in this cave in South America.  So now, Dracula's forced himself to come to Hollywood for this big wedding and bring all of his relatives who are pretty ridiculous people.  There's a wonderful scene at the bachelor party in a strip club, it's great stuff.<ref>[http://www.thedivareview.com/My_One_and_Only_Interview.htm Interview with George Hamilton] accessed 23 December 2014</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo date, a sequel has yet to go into production.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vampire film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0079489}}\n* {{tcmdb title|22749|Love at First Bite}}\n* {{Allmovie title|30333}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=love_at_first_bite}}\n* [http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=30333 New York Times listing]\n\n{{Dracula}}\n{{Stan Dragoti}}\n\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1970s comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:1970s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American International Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American parody films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Dracula films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stan Dragoti]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Charles Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Parodies of horror]]\n[[Category:Vampire comedy films]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_at_First_Bite"}
