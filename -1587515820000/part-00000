From a small circle of three to four families, Cedros grew to about thirty neighbors by about 1715, so said Father [[Ant\u00f3nio Cordeiro]]. The same author, referred to the existence of the hamlet of Ponta Ruiva with a few residents and a small port, which were integrated into the parish of S\u00e3o Pedro (in [[Ponta Delgada, Santa Cruz das Flores]]) at the time.\n\nAlthough Cedros was considered a \"breadbasket\" of the region, it had an important place in the economy of the island for the abundance of the Azorean cedar (cedros-do-mato) because its lumber was used in the construction of ships for fishing, for the early homes and the implements used in agriculture. The fibers of the cedars were usually dried in the sun, and used to produce twine or ropes.\n\nBut, Ilh\u00e9u Furado and the anchorage of Alagoa was, during many decades, the natural access to the island of Flores when winds from the southeast were strong. Alagoa was the heart of Cedros, due to its access to the sea, and connection to the interior pasturelands and orchards.\n\nThe distance between Cedros and Ponta Ruivo from their respective parishes, at  the time, the mountainous cliffs and valleys and climate, made the residents petition the Bishop of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]], at the time Friar Clement Vieira, to de-annex their localities from their respective parishes. By doing so, the residents would constitute their own parish and construct a church, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora do Pilar, at their own cost. The Captain-major at the time, D. Martinho de Mascarenhas (sixth Count of Santa Cruz) also supported the claims of the citizens, and offered to build a chapel and to donate a statue of Senhora do Pilar. After bishop Ant\u00f3nio \u00c1lvares Pereira de Sousa visited the community in 1690, and after having agreed to elevate the community to parish he died, and the decision was delayed. Finally, Cedros, Ponta Ruiva and possibly Alagoa, were elevated to parish on July 9, 1693, a community of 176 inhabitants in 50 homes. Father Domingos Furtado de Mendon\u00e7a was its first parish priest, he had an annual pay of about 24$000 r\u00e9is, two parts in wheat and one in cash, of which he paid a portion to the Count of Sant Cruz. Faithful to their promise the residents constructed a new church, that was completed in 1693, and which the Count complied in donating the new chapel, whose addition was completed in 1719. Inscriptions on two rocks found during demolition on the church in September 1945 confirm these facts, as well as a shield of D. Martinho de Mascarenhas and cross etched with 1693 and 1719, respectively. The church was reconstructed in 1822, but by 1868 a report by the Civil Governor of the District of Horta, at that time Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Vieira Santa Rita, considered the building to be in a bad state of conservation.\n\nUntil the 20th century it was common for many Cedrenses, much like most poor in the Azores, to travel shoeless, and brought their shoes, ties and some clothing in a satchel when traveling to the \"cosmopolitan\"  community of Santa Cruz. Ironically, the community had a distinction for being the population with the lowest level of illiteracy on the island of Flores:  a fact that was attributed to professor Fraga (their local school teacher), who died in 1929.\n\nAfter the demolition of the insecure old church in September 1945, the cornerstone of the new church was planted on January 22, 1950, thanks to the efforts of its parish priest, Father Jos\u00e9 Maria \u00c1lvares, receiving its consecration on June 18, 1953.\n\nUntil 1966, when the French military base was constructed, there was no formal road connecting Cedros with Ponta Delgada. At that time, Cedros became the terminus of the road network from the south (ending at Ponta Ruiva), and Ponta Delgada was only accessible by trail or by sea (as the weather permitted).\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\nThe parish is delimited by the deep river-valley of Alagoa in the south, and Ribeira dos Cedros to the north (which separates Cedros from the parish of Ponta Delgada). Much like the parish [[Cedros (Horta)|of the same name]] on Faial, the settlement was given its name for the abundance of cedar trees (cedros-do-mato, or in Latin, [[Juniperus brevifolia]]), which its woods were used by the colonists for buildings during settlement in the 16th century. In fact, the availability of this wood allowed the growth of the community, which was located in a relatively isolated promontory along the coast. Gaspar Frutuoso, noted:  \"...there is a high cliff, projecting into the ocean, dressed in trees of cedar, laurel and white wood, it's [an area] populated by many of the Captain's wild goats [and whom]...living above are three or four neighbors...this is the area we call Cedros, for there are many there\".\n\nTwo sheltered bays also guard the coast of Cedros:  along the coast of the valley of Alagoa (where there are several islets), and in front of Ponta Ruiva, where a small port was located. The small rocky islets (of which Fragata, Garajau, Carneiros and the islet of \u00c1lvaro Rodrigues) are all rocky, shallow features; apart from the islet of \u00c1lvaro Rodrigues, which was cultivated until about the middle of the 20th century, the islets are uninhabitable and lack sources of water.\n\n===Ecoregions/Protected areas===\n* Park of Alagoa ({{lang-pt|Parque de Alagoa}}) - located near an uninhabited settlement, it is a natural extension of the Ribeira da Alagoa, the ravine and valley that divides the coast;\n* Nature Reserve of Alagoa Bay Islets and Baixa do Moinho ({{lang-pt|Reserva Natural dos Ilh\u00e9us da Ba\u00eda da Alagoa e Baixa do Moinho}}), a site of communitarian interest, that includes an area of {{convert|100|m2|ft2}} around the islets of Alagoa, for the protection of marine flora and fauna, and especially for population of [[roseate tern|roseate]] and [[common tern]]s. It is part of the larger ''S\u00edtio de Import\u00e2ncia Comunit\u00e1ria (SIC) Costa Nordeste'' (''Northern Coastal Site of Communitarian Interest'') management plan, that includes an area with specific restrictions on what uses (including fishing and tourism) and environmental restrictions;<ref>UA\u00e7/DOP (2004)</ref>\n* There are several lookouts/belvederes within the limits of Cedros that add to scenic nature of the community: ''Miradouro dos Caimbros'', ''Miradouro do Po\u00e7o Comprido'', ''Miradouro da Rocha da Gata'' and the ''Miradouro da Tapada Nova''.\n\n===Human geography===\nThe development of this area is unique in the Azores (owing to the higher altitudes and the prominence of strong winds) resulting in very isolated communities, that now have become linked by the roadways. Consequently, the parish has developed into three localities:\n\n* Cedros, the center of the parish, location of the parochial church, its small school (now closed as children are bused to the vila of Ponta Delgada);\n* Ponta Ruiva, a small hamlet situated five kilometers northeast of Cedros on a high promontory by the sea;\n* Alagoa, a site along the deep valley of ''Ribeira da Alagoa'', about {{convert|1|km|mi}} south of Cedros, with few permanent residents, that was once the location of a small fort used for the defense of the coast from attacks by pirates or privateers.\n\n==Economy==\nThe parish maintains its traditional rural character; the majority of its inhabitants are involved in agriculture, principally the raising of cattle, although some carpentry and commercial activities occur in this zone. Milling was also important, resulting in the construction of several mills along the Ribeira das Barrosas and Ribeira da Alagoa.\n\nAlso, due to a micro-climate in the area of Alagoa, the parish enjoyed a period of fruit cultivation (something rare to the rest of the island), where oblong ''apples'' (similar to pears in shape) were grown. The small port of Alagoa, for many decades, was the point of embarkation for orange exports from the valley; an example of a successes in a peripheral economy, orange exports were sent directly to England, by English and Portuguese ships.\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Civic===\n* Alagoa, the uninhabited community, but not in a state of ruins, notable for several architectural important buildings used during the early history of the community, including mills and a main bridge constructed in the 15th century;\n* Decorated Stone ''Rua da Igreja'' ({{lang-pt|Pedra Decorada na Rua da Igreja}});\n* Haylofts of Faj\u00e3 dos Cedros ({{lang-pt|Palheiros \u00e0 Faj\u00e3 dos Cedros}});\n* Haylofts of ''Rua da Esperan\u00e7a'' ({{lang-pt|Palheiros Rua da Esperan\u00e7a}});\n* Kiln of Cedros ({{lang-pt|Forno aos Cedros}});\n* Kiln of Faj\u00e3 dos Cedros ({{lang-pt|Furnas \u00e0 Faj\u00e3 dos Cedros}})\n* Ponta Ruiva, a small hamlet, architecturally similar to homes built in [[Vila do Corvo]];\n* Residence ''Rua Manuel Maria de Freitas'' ({{lang-pt|Casa de Habita\u00e7\u00e3o Rua Manuel Maria de Freitas}})\n* Watermills of Ribeira dos Moinhos ({{lang-pt|Moinhos de \u00c1gua e Caminho \u00e0 Ribeira dos Moinhos}})\n\n===Military===\n* Artillery Battery of Alagoa ({{lang-pt|Bateria da Alagoa}}), located in a dominant position overlooking the Bay of Alagoa, it was constructed during a period of Cedros' history when raids by pirates occurred frequently\n\n===Religious===\n* [[Church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar (Cedros)|Church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar]] ({{lang-pt|Igreja Paroquial de Cedros/Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Pilar}})\n* Imp\u00e9rio of the Divine Holy Spirit de Cima ({{lang-pt|Imp\u00e9rio do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo das Casas de Cima}}), constructed in 1856, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts\n* Imp\u00e9rio of the Divine Holy Spirit de Baixo ({{lang-pt|Imp\u00e9rio do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo das Casas de Baixo}}), constructed in 1861, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts\n* * Imp\u00e9rio of the Divine Holy Spirit of Ponta Ruiva ({{lang-pt|Imp\u00e9rio do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo de Ponta Ruiva }}), constructed in 1861, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Festivities===\nThe parish realizes its principal festival in honor of Nossa Senhora do Pilar and [[Saint Roch|S\u00e3o Roque]] on the third Sunday of August. It also follows the tradition of the festivals of the Holy Spirit which are common in the islands of the Azores, here celebrated on the Sunday of Pentecosts.\n\n===Tradition===\nFaithful to tradition, there are still some who are involved in the handicraft industry reproducing in miniature implements used in the agriculture, for sale to tourists.\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation |last=Cordeiro |first=Ant\u00f3nio |title=Hist\u00f3ria Insulana das Ilhas a Portugal Sujeitas no Oceano Ocidental |publisher=Imprensa de Ant\u00f3nio Pedroso Galv\u00e3o, Lisboa Ocidental |year=1717}}\n* {{citation |last=Frutuoso |first=Gaspar |title=Saudades da Terra (Vol.VI) |publisher=Ponta Delgada (A\u00e7ores): Instituto Cultural de Ponta Delgada |year=2005 |isbn=972-9216-70-3}}\n* {{citation |last=Neves |first=Carlos |author2=Carvalho, Filipe |author3=Artur Teodoro Mato |title=Documenta\u00e7\u00e3o sobre as Fortifica\u00e7\u00f5es dos A\u00e7ores existentes nos Arquivos de Lisboa \u2013 Cat\u00e1logo |publisher=Boletim do Instituto Hist\u00f3rico da Ilha Terceira, Vol.1 |year=1992}}\n* {{citation |first=Rog\u00e9rio R. |last=Ferraz |first2=Pedro |last2=Frade |first3=Samanta |last3=Vizinho |first4=Frederico |last4=Cardigos |first5=Fernando |last5=Tempera |first6=Vanessa |last6=Santos |first7=Vera |last7=Guerreiro |first8=Ricardo Serr\u00e3o |last8=Santos |title=Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o Ecol\u00f3gica e S\u00f3cio-Econ\u00f3mica do S\u00edtio de Import\u00e2ncia Comunit\u00e1ria Costa Nordeste das Flores (PTFLO0003) e Medidas de Gest\u00e3o Propostas |trans-title=Ecological Characterization and Communitarian Socio-Economic Importance of the Northeast Coast of Flores (PTFLO0003) and Methods for Management: Proposal |publisher=Universidade dos A\u00e7ores/Departamento de Oceanografia e Pescas |year=2004 |location=Ponta Delgada, Azores |url=http://www.horta.uac.pt/projectos/macmar/ogamp/PlanosGestao/PG_SIC/PG_OGAMP_Costa_NE_Flores.pdf}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cedros (Santa Cruz Das Flores)}}\n[[Category:Parishes of Santa Cruz das Flores]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Portuguese subdivision\n| type                    = parish\n| name                    = Cedros\n| image_skyline           = Baia da Alagoa Cedros Flores Azores.jpg\n| image_caption           = Alagoa Bay and islets seen from the air (the village over the cliff at the center is Cedros; to the far right is Ponta Ruiva)\n| image_flag              = \n| image_shield            = \n| region                  = Azores\n| island                  = [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]]\n| municipality            = [[Santa Cruz das Flores]]\n| coordinates             = {{coord|39|28|50|N|31|9|12|W|display=inline,title}}\n| established_date        = Parish: 29 July 1693\n| area_total_km2          = 10.30\n| elevation_m             = 299\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_total        = 128\n| postal_code             = 9970-031\n| area_code               = 292 \n| patron                  = [[Our Lady of the Pillar|Nossa Senhora do Pilar]]\n| website                 = {{url|http://www.cmscflores.pt/freguesias/cedros.php|cmscflores.pt}}\n}}\n'''Cedros''' is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Santa Cruz das Flores]], on the island of [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] in the Azores.

Much like the parish [[Cedros (Horta)|of the same name]] on Faial, the settlement was given its name for the abundance of cedar trees (cedros-do-mato, or in Latin, [[Juniperus brevifolia]]), which its woods were used by the colonists for buildings during settlement in the 16th century. In fact, the availability of this wood allowed the growth of the community, which was located in a relatively isolated promontory along the coast. Gaspar Frutuoso, noted:  \"...there is a high cliff, projecting into the ocean, dressed in trees of cedar, laurel and white wood, it's [an area] populated by many of the Captain's wild goats [and whom]...living above are three or four neighbors...this is the area we call Cedros, for there are many there\".\n\nTwo sheltered bays also guard the coast of Cedros:  along the coast of the valley of Alagoa (where there are several islets), and in front of Ponta Ruiva, where a small port was located. The small rocky islets (of which Fragata, Garajau, Carneiros and the islet of \u00c1lvaro Rodrigues) are all rocky, shallow features; apart from the islet of \u00c1lvaro Rodrigues, which was cultivated until about the middle of the 20th century, the islets are uninhabitable and lack sources of water.\n\n===Ecoregions/Protected areas===\n* Park of Alagoa ({{lang-pt|Parque de Alagoa}}) - located near an uninhabited settlement, it is a natural extension of the Ribeira da Alagoa, the ravine and valley that divides the coast;\n* Nature Reserve of Alagoa Bay Islets and Baixa do Moinho ({{lang-pt|Reserva Natural dos Ilh\u00e9us da Ba\u00eda da Alagoa e Baixa do Moinho}}), a site of communitarian interest, that includes an area of {{convert|100|m2|ft2}} around the islets of Alagoa, for the protection of marine flora and fauna, and especially for population of [[roseate tern|roseate]] and [[common tern]]s. It is part of the larger ''S\u00edtio de Import\u00e2ncia Comunit\u00e1ria (SIC) Costa Nordeste'' (''Northern Coastal Site of Communitarian Interest'') management plan, that includes an area with specific restrictions on what uses (including fishing and tourism) and environmental restrictions;<ref>UA\u00e7/DOP (2004)</ref>\n* There are several lookouts/belvederes within the limits of Cedros that add to scenic nature of the community: ''Miradouro dos Caimbros'', ''Miradouro do Po\u00e7o Comprido'', ''Miradouro da Rocha da Gata'' and the ''Miradouro da Tapada Nova''.\n\n===Human geography===\nThe development of this area is unique in the Azores (owing to the higher altitudes and the prominence of strong winds) resulting in very isolated communities, that now have become linked by the roadways. Consequently, the parish has developed into three localities:\n\n* Cedros, the center of the parish, location of the parochial church, its small school (now closed as children are bused to the vila of Ponta Delgada);\n* Ponta Ruiva, a small hamlet situated five kilometers northeast of Cedros on a high promontory by the sea;\n* Alagoa, a site along the deep valley of ''Ribeira da Alagoa'', about {{convert|1|km|mi}} south of Cedros, with few permanent residents, that was once the location of a small fort used for the defense of the coast from attacks by pirates or privateers.\n\n==Economy==\nThe parish maintains its traditional rural character; the majority of its inhabitants are involved in agriculture, principally the raising of cattle, although some carpentry and commercial activities occur in this zone. Milling was also important, resulting in the construction of several mills along the Ribeira das Barrosas and Ribeira da Alagoa.\n\nAlso, due to a micro-climate in the area of Alagoa, the parish enjoyed a period of fruit cultivation (something rare to the rest of the island), where oblong ''apples'' (similar to pears in shape) were grown. The small port of Alagoa, for many decades, was the point of embarkation for orange exports from the valley; an example of a successes in a peripheral economy, orange exports were sent directly to England, by English and Portuguese ships.\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Civic===\n* Alagoa, the uninhabited community, but not in a state of ruins, notable for several architectural important buildings used during the early history of the community, including mills and a main bridge constructed in the 15th century;\n* Decorated Stone ''Rua da Igreja'' ({{lang-pt|Pedra Decorada na Rua da Igreja}});\n* Haylofts of Faj\u00e3 dos Cedros ({{lang-pt|Palheiros \u00e0 Faj\u00e3 dos Cedros}});\n* Haylofts of ''Rua da Esperan\u00e7a'' ({{lang-pt|Palheiros Rua da Esperan\u00e7a}});\n* Kiln of Cedros ({{lang-pt|Forno aos Cedros}});\n* Kiln of Faj\u00e3 dos Cedros ({{lang-pt|Furnas \u00e0 Faj\u00e3 dos Cedros}})\n* Ponta Ruiva, a small hamlet, architecturally similar to homes built in [[Vila do Corvo]];\n* Residence ''Rua Manuel Maria de Freitas'' ({{lang-pt|Casa de Habita\u00e7\u00e3o Rua Manuel Maria de Freitas}})\n* Watermills of Ribeira dos Moinhos ({{lang-pt|Moinhos de \u00c1gua e Caminho \u00e0 Ribeira dos Moinhos}})\n\n===Military===\n* Artillery Battery of Alagoa ({{lang-pt|Bateria da Alagoa}}), located in a dominant position overlooking the Bay of Alagoa, it was constructed during a period of Cedros' history when raids by pirates occurred frequently\n\n===Religious===\n* [[Church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar (Cedros)|Church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar]] ({{lang-pt|Igreja Paroquial de Cedros/Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Pilar}})\n* Imp\u00e9rio of the Divine Holy Spirit de Cima ({{lang-pt|Imp\u00e9rio do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo das Casas de Cima}}), constructed in 1856, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts\n* Imp\u00e9rio of the Divine Holy Spirit de Baixo ({{lang-pt|Imp\u00e9rio do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo das Casas de Baixo}}), constructed in 1861, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts\n* * Imp\u00e9rio of the Divine Holy Spirit of Ponta Ruiva ({{lang-pt|Imp\u00e9rio do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo de Ponta Ruiva }}), constructed in 1861, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Festivities===\nThe parish realizes its principal festival in honor of Nossa Senhora do Pilar and [[Saint Roch|S\u00e3o Roque]] on the third Sunday of August. It also follows the tradition of the festivals of the Holy Spirit which are common in the islands of the Azores, here celebrated on the Sunday of Pentecosts.\n\n===Tradition===\nFaithful to tradition, there are still some who are involved in the handicraft industry reproducing in miniature implements used in the agriculture, for sale to tourists.\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation |last=Cordeiro |first=Ant\u00f3nio |title=Hist\u00f3ria Insulana das Ilhas a Portugal Sujeitas no Oceano Ocidental |publisher=Imprensa de Ant\u00f3nio Pedroso Galv\u00e3o, Lisboa Ocidental |year=1717}}\n* {{citation |last=Frutuoso |first=Gaspar |title=Saudades da Terra (Vol.VI) |publisher=Ponta Delgada (A\u00e7ores): Instituto Cultural de Ponta Delgada |year=2005 |isbn=972-9216-70-3}}\n* {{citation |last=Neves |first=Carlos |author2=Carvalho, Filipe |author3=Artur Teodoro Mato |title=Documenta\u00e7\u00e3o sobre as Fortifica\u00e7\u00f5es dos A\u00e7ores existentes nos Arquivos de Lisboa \u2013 Cat\u00e1logo |publisher=Boletim do Instituto Hist\u00f3rico da Ilha Terceira, Vol.1 |year=1992}}\n* {{citation |first=Rog\u00e9rio R. |last=Ferraz |first2=Pedro |last2=Frade |first3=Samanta |last3=Vizinho |first4=Frederico |last4=Cardigos |first5=Fernando |last5=Tempera |first6=Vanessa |last6=Santos |first7=Vera |last7=Guerreiro |first8=Ricardo Serr\u00e3o |last8=Santos |title=Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o Ecol\u00f3gica e S\u00f3cio-Econ\u00f3mica do S\u00edtio de Import\u00e2ncia Comunit\u00e1ria Costa Nordeste das Flores (PTFLO0003) e Medidas de Gest\u00e3o Propostas |trans-title=Ecological Characterization and Communitarian Socio-Economic Importance of the Northeast Coast of Flores (PTFLO0003) and Methods for Management: Proposal |publisher=Universidade dos A\u00e7ores/Departamento de Oceanografia e Pescas |year=2004 |location=Ponta Delgada, Azores |url=http://www.horta.uac.pt/projectos/macmar/ogamp/PlanosGestao/PG_SIC/PG_OGAMP_Costa_NE_Flores.pdf}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cedros (Santa Cruz Das Flores)}}\n[[Category:Parishes of Santa Cruz das Flores]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSources:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedros_(Santa_Cruz_das_Flores)"}

The population in 2011 was 907,<ref>[http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xlang=en&xpid=INE&xpgid=ine_indicadores&indOcorrCod=0005889&contexto=pi&selTab=tab0 Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]</ref> in an area of {{convert|24.5|km2|ft2}}.<ref>[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/nuts_nomenclature/documents/PT-LAU.xls Eurostat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007042623/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/nuts_nomenclature/documents/PT-LAU.xls |date=October 7, 2012 }}</ref> The northernmost parish on the island, it is located {{convert|19|km|mi}} northwest of Horta and is linked via the ''Estrada Regional E.R. 1-1\u00aa'' roadway to the rest of the island. The tree-covered hills and pasture-lands cover the interior, and hedged farmlands extend to the Atlantic coastline cliffs, a natural plateau above the sea, that was settled by early Flemish and Spanish colonists in the late part of the 15th century.  Primarily an agricultural community, the population is comparable in size to other parishes on the island, though this has decreased by half since the 1950s (when there were approximately 2000 inhabitants). Today, it remains an agricultural centre of the island of Faial, anchored by the ''Cooperativa Agr\u00edcola dos Lact\u00edcinios do Faial'', one of the primary rural industries on the island, responsible for sales of milk, cheese and butter.\n\n==History==\n[[File:FreguesiaCedros Santa Barabara.jpg|left|235px|thumb|The parochial Church of Santa B\u00e1rbara, as it currently appears in Pra\u00e7a (the village square) after extensive renovation following the 1971 fire.]]\nThe history of the settlement of Cedros was tied to the failure of the [[Flemish]] nobleman [[Josse van Huerter]]'s first expedition in 1466 to the island. Abandoned by Huerter, some members of his failed expedition were joined by settlers from Terceira and Spain whom explored and settled along the northern coast of Faial.\n\nThe origin of the name '''Cedros''' comes from the local cedars (the '''Cedros-das-Ilhas''' or '''Cedros-do-Mato''') found in the pasture-lands and forests of the area ({{lang-lat|[[Juniperus brevifolia]]}}).  In addition to the cedars, along the numerous river-valleys (especially Ribeira Funda, Ribeira Pinheiro and Ribeira Sousa) they encountered species of [[Pine]], [[Juniper]], flowering plants (such as the family ''[[Adoxaceae]]''), laurel ({{lang-lat|[[Laurus azorica]]}}), [[Buckthorn]] ({{lang-lat|[[Rhamnus (plant)|Rhamnus]]}}), and [[Hedychium|Ginger Lily]] ({{lang-lat|[[Hedychium gardnerianum]]}}), as well as other broad-leaf plants.  Close access to potable water allowed the settlers to develop small tracts of land, build homes of ubiquitous volcanic rock and cultivate a subsistence lifestyle:  a few animals (cows, lambs or goats) and a small vegetable garden. The introduction of wheat allowed the development of a small local export industry.\n\nBetween 1466-67, [[Josse van Huerter]] returned to the island, through the patronage from the Duke of Burgundy.  After a failed settlement on the Lomba dos Frades, he established the nucleus of what would become [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] and beginning the first [[Captaincy]] of the island.  Some of the more adventurous settlers, primarily from the island of [[Terceira]],<ref name=\"Daniel&Soares\">Luis Daniel & Natacha Soares (ed.), 2003, p.136</ref> followed the trails north to the area now known as Santa B\u00e1rbara (Pra\u00e7a). These new settlers were more affluent then the original settlers (some even noblemen), who constructed larger, more ornate homes:  such as the '''''Castelo da Rocha Negra''''' (or ''Casa dos Lacerdas dos Cedros''), a three-floor house with molded cornices, verandas, and corbels in black volcanic rock.\n\nFather [[Gaspar Frutuoso]], the celebrated Portuguese historian, priest and humanist, best known for his six-part tome '''''Saudades da Terra''''' that documented the genealogy and history of the Azores archipelago, recounted the conflicts, histories and personalities of the region.  While, the development of the stain/[[woad]] industry and conflict between impresarios Van Huerter and Wilhelm van der Hagen were  important events on the island, it was the [[Flemish people|Fleming]] Hern Jannequim that created controversies in Cedros. Also known as Arnequim, he caused his own problems by confronting and expelling the Magistrate-of-Justice and then threatening the Captain-General with death, when they prepared to capture him. The conflict was eventually resolved by the King who was bemused by his audacity. Regardless, Flemish influence and importance had slowly begun to decline on the island, and Spanish settlers began to venture to this region.\n\nThe village was formally founded in 1594: this date is conjecture, based on evidence found during the reconstruction of the parochial [[Church of Santa B\u00e1rbara (Horta)|Church of Santa B\u00e1rbara]] following a fire that occurred in November 1971.<ref name=\"Daniel&Soares\"/>  The church was originally constructed during the [[Iberian Union]], in grand dimensions and in a style different from other churches on Faial (including four bells in the tower). The northern bell was large, and many locals reflected that it could be heard from as far as the base of the island's caldera.  A current myth, perpetuated by older residents, involves the disappearance of the bells which, some say, were mysteriously removed and installed at the [[S\u00e9 Cathedral of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]], [[Terceira]].  An anonymous letter was also sent at one time stating that the bells were buried beside the church, although the bells were never found. Another interesting holdover of the Iberian Union was the enormous silver-plated oil lamp that hung within the church (the only other lamp of similar dimensions was hung in Spain).\n\nBy 1643, [[Friar]] [[Diogo das Chagas]] claimed the parish was inhabited by 2126 people. In 1672, a violent eruption caused an important exodus to Brasil. Also, the end of the Iberian Union, resulted in the expulsion of most of the Spanish living in the parish (which included [[Sal\u00e3o]] at the time). Similarly, an epidemic between 1717 and 1718 caused the deaths of many. Yet, the growth of the [[Carmelite]], [[Jesuit]] and [[Franciscan]] religious orders at about the same time resulted in the growth of the faith community on Faial.\n\n===Legend of the Moorish Crown of Cedros===\nA legend that dates back to the [[Philippine Dynasty]], recalls the time after the fall of [[Terceira]], when the islands of the Azores were occupied by forces of [[Philip II of Spain]]. Even before this time the Azores had always been cursed by pirates and privateers, who would attack by surprise during foggy days, under the cover of night or the light of day. They assaulted, robbed and sacked many of the communities along the coast, sometimes conscripting men to work as slaves. As legend tells, a pirate [[galleon]], commanded by a [[Moors|Moorish]] King attacked the island of Faial, but since the ship was spotted in time, the local population was given time to prepare. The pirates encountered stiff resistance and were forced to retreat without pillaging the homes along the northern coast.\n\nDuring the course of the retreat, the Moorish King lost his crown (made of silver and adorned with leaf in sparkling metal), after leaving it along a hedge-row while battling the defenders. Along the coast, the King remembered he had left his crown behind, and not wanting to lose his symbol of power, he resolved to return to the island. But, not wanting to be recognized as pirates they returned as local mariners. Not discovering the lost crown where he had left it, the group began to ask around but found no clues to its location. The local people began to get suspicious, and they were obliged to abandon their search and returned to their lands in [[North Africa]], from which they did not return.\n\nMeanwhile, the crown was discovered by a woman from Cedros, who, when she heard that they were searching for it, was suspicious that they were pirates and attempted to hide the crown. She wisely raised her skirt, and placed her leg through the ring-like crown, and passed unbeknownst to the pirates. Realizing the value of the object, and not wanting her contemporaries to know what she had hidden, she continued to wear the crown around her leg until it began to swell and hurt. In the end she informed the towns-people, who attempted to extricate the woman from the crown, washing her leg in water and ash soap to loosen it, but without success. In the end, the residents had no alternative but to cut the crown and later re-solder it cautiously. In the end the crown remained in the parish of Cedros and over time it was used in the feasts to the [[Cult of the Holy Spirit|Divine Holy Spirit]]. With the passing of time and fearful of damaging such a symbolic and rich object, a copy of the crown was created, and the original was hidden away and guarded. As the legend ends, the crown continues to be guarded every year at the home of the ''mordomo'' of the Holy Spirit feasts, and that the cuts are still visible around the crown. It is unknown whether any part of the above story is more than legend.<ref>\u00c2ngela Furtado-Brum, 1999, p. 255-256</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:FreguesiasCedros.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The northern coast of Cedros showing many of the communities and principal agglomerations]]\nCedros is one of the largest parishes on the island of Faial.  It is bordered on the east by [[Sal\u00e3o]] and west by [[Praia do Norte]] and extends from the coast to the center of the island (and the [[Cabe\u00e7o Gordo]] volcano).  Apart from the rich pasture-lands and hedged-fields in Alto do Inverno, Alto do Rigo or Cabe\u00e7a da Vaca, the coastal cliffs are approximately {{convert|75|to|271|m|ft}} above sea level (the highest coastal altitude in this parish being near Ribeira Funda).  The region is intersected by several rivers and valley creeks including ''Ribeira Funda'' (''the Deep Ravine''), ''Ribeira Pinheiro'' (''Pine Ravine'') and ''Ribeira Sousa'' (''Sousa Ravine'', named after one of the original settlers), which are usually dry throughout most of the year.\n\nThe population is concentrated along the Regional E.R. 1-1a Roadway that circles the island.  Pra\u00e7a (''village square'') is the more urbanized centre of parish, although most places are identified by the smaller neighbourhoods, or ''localities'' ({{lang-pt|lugares}}), where settlements developed, including Porto de Eira, Cabe\u00e7o, Cascalho, Cov\u00f5es and Ribeira Funda.  Uphill, a secondary road (linked to the E.R. 1-1\u00aa by the ''Canada da Sousa'', ''Rua de Igreja'' and ''Canada do Vale'') connects the ''localities'' of Canto, Janalves and Miragaia (colloquially known as the ''Rua de Cima'').  Each of these places have their own distinctions, and some include their own local pubs, community markets ({{lang-pt|mercearias}}) or religious sanctuaries (there are four ''imperios'' (temples to the Holy Spirit) in Cedros.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:FreguesiaCedros CALF.jpg|left|235px|thumb|CALF (''Cooperativa Agr\u00edcola dos Lact\u00edcinios do Faial'') expanded milk processing facilities, as seen along the E.R. Regional Road]]\nThe main economy in this area is agriculture.  The soil of the parish is fertile allowing the cultivation of various legumes and grains. Wheat, corn, beans, potatoes and sweet potatoes have been agricultural staples in the region over the decades.\n\nDairy production has also had an important role in the economy since this  northern coast was populated, but it only became an organized industry in the early 1920s. About this time an enterprising couple (Professor Constantino Magno do Amaral and D. Teresa) began a small factory in the area of ''Rua da Igreja'', eventually occupying the building currently \"occupied\" by Ethnographic Museum ('''Nulceu Etnogr\u00e1fico dos Cedros''') across from the main church. Later, a second firm, '''Castro, Merrinho & Xavier''' began operating in Cascalho, along ''Canada do In\u00eas''. Jos\u00e9 Freitas also developed a small business in ''Canto da Gatinha'', a group of investors started the '''Uni\u00e3o dos Lavradores''' that operated along the regional road, and the '''Uni\u00e3o Industrial Cedrenses''' (locally referred to as \"f\u00e1brica do Marujo\") was also formed in Pra\u00e7a (long after Professor Amaral's operation had ceased). By 1941 many of these operations had been bought or failed and the remaining businesses, Castro, Merrinho & Xavier and Uni\u00e3o Industrial, were being squeezed by low milk prices. It was then that a group of enterprising farmers, under the counsel of Professor Jos\u00e9 da Rosa Aica, banded together to form what would eventually be known as the cooperative '''CALF: the Cooperativa Agr\u00edcola dos Lact\u00edcinios do Faial'''. The idea of a cooperative spread quickly in the north of the island through the parishes, and it quickly became the largest enterprise on the island. Castro, Merrinho & Xavier was later purchased by a group from Lisbon to form '''Lacto A\u00e7oreana''', it lasted briefly, eventually coming under the control of a Horta businessman and failing. The Uni\u00e3o Industrial Cedrense was purchased by '''Martins & Rebello''', then the largest milk processor in Portugal, and moved to Cascalho (not too far from the Cooperativo) to occupy the old Castro, Merrinho & Xavier buildings. By 2004, the Cooperative had survived the competition, and restructured its operations to compete in the European market, expanding physically to handle the production.

The tree-covered hills and pasture-lands cover the interior, and hedged farmlands extend to the Atlantic coastline cliffs, a natural plateau above the sea, that was settled by early Flemish and Spanish colonists in the late part of the 15th century.  Primarily an agricultural community, the population is comparable in size to other parishes on the island, though this has decreased by half since the 1950s (when there were approximately 2000 inhabitants). Today, it remains an agricultural centre of the island of Faial, anchored by the ''Cooperativa Agr\u00edcola dos Lact\u00edcinios do Faial'', one of the primary rural industries on the island, responsible for sales of milk, cheese and butter.\n\n==History==\n[[File:FreguesiaCedros Santa Barabara.jpg|left|235px|thumb|The parochial Church of Santa B\u00e1rbara, as it currently appears in Pra\u00e7a (the village square) after extensive renovation following the 1971 fire.]]\nThe history of the settlement of Cedros was tied to the failure of the [[Flemish]] nobleman [[Josse van Huerter]]'s first expedition in 1466 to the island. Abandoned by Huerter, some members of his failed expedition were joined by settlers from Terceira and Spain whom explored and settled along the northern coast of Faial.\n\nThe origin of the name '''Cedros''' comes from the local cedars (the '''Cedros-das-Ilhas''' or '''Cedros-do-Mato''') found in the pasture-lands and forests of the area ({{lang-lat|[[Juniperus brevifolia]]}}).  In addition to the cedars, along the numerous river-valleys (especially Ribeira Funda, Ribeira Pinheiro and Ribeira Sousa) they encountered species of [[Pine]], [[Juniper]], flowering plants (such as the family ''[[Adoxaceae]]''), laurel ({{lang-lat|[[Laurus azorica]]}}), [[Buckthorn]] ({{lang-lat|[[Rhamnus (plant)|Rhamnus]]}}), and [[Hedychium|Ginger Lily]] ({{lang-lat|[[Hedychium gardnerianum]]}}), as well as other broad-leaf plants.  Close access to potable water allowed the settlers to develop small tracts of land, build homes of ubiquitous volcanic rock and cultivate a subsistence lifestyle:  a few animals (cows, lambs or goats) and a small vegetable garden. The introduction of wheat allowed the development of a small local export industry.\n\nBetween 1466-67, [[Josse van Huerter]] returned to the island, through the patronage from the Duke of Burgundy.  After a failed settlement on the Lomba dos Frades, he established the nucleus of what would become [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] and beginning the first [[Captaincy]] of the island.  Some of the more adventurous settlers, primarily from the island of [[Terceira]],<ref name=\"Daniel&Soares\">Luis Daniel & Natacha Soares (ed.), 2003, p.136</ref> followed the trails north to the area now known as Santa B\u00e1rbara (Pra\u00e7a). These new settlers were more affluent then the original settlers (some even noblemen), who constructed larger, more ornate homes:  such as the '''''Castelo da Rocha Negra''''' (or ''Casa dos Lacerdas dos Cedros''), a three-floor house with molded cornices, verandas, and corbels in black volcanic rock. \n\nFather [[Gaspar Frutuoso]], the celebrated Portuguese historian, priest and humanist, best known for his six-part tome '''''Saudades da Terra''''' that documented the genealogy and history of the Azores archipelago, recounted the conflicts, histories and personalities of the region.  While, the development of the stain/[[woad]] industry and conflict between impresarios Van Huerter and Wilhelm van der Hagen were  important events on the island, it was the [[Flemish people|Fleming]] Hern Jannequim that created controversies in Cedros. Also known as Arnequim, he caused his own problems by confronting and expelling the Magistrate-of-Justice and then threatening the Captain-General with death, when they prepared to capture him. The conflict was eventually resolved by the King who was bemused by his audacity. Regardless, Flemish influence and importance had slowly begun to decline on the island, and Spanish settlers began to venture to this region.\n\nThe village was formally founded in 1594: this date is conjecture, based on evidence found during the reconstruction of the parochial [[Church of Santa B\u00e1rbara (Horta)|Church of Santa B\u00e1rbara]] following a fire that occurred in November 1971.<ref name=\"Daniel&Soares\"/>  The church was originally constructed during the [[Iberian Union]], in grand dimensions and in a style different from other churches on Faial (including four bells in the tower). The northern bell was large, and many locals reflected that it could be heard from as far as the base of the island's caldera.  A current myth, perpetuated by older residents, involves the disappearance of the bells which, some say, were mysteriously removed and installed at the [[S\u00e9 Cathedral of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]], [[Terceira]].  An anonymous letter was also sent at one time stating that the bells were buried beside the church, although the bells were never found. Another interesting holdover of the Iberian Union was the enormous silver-plated oil lamp that hung within the church (the only other lamp of similar dimensions was hung in Spain).\n\nBy 1643, [[Friar]] [[Diogo das Chagas]] claimed the parish was inhabited by 2126 people. In 1672, a violent eruption caused an important exodus to Brasil. Also, the end of the Iberian Union, resulted in the expulsion of most of the Spanish living in the parish (which included [[Sal\u00e3o]] at the time). Similarly, an epidemic between 1717 and 1718 caused the deaths of many. Yet, the growth of the [[Carmelite]], [[Jesuit]] and [[Franciscan]] religious orders at about the same time resulted in the growth of the faith community on Faial.\n\n===Legend of the Moorish Crown of Cedros===\nA legend that dates back to the [[Philippine Dynasty]], recalls the time after the fall of [[Terceira]], when the islands of the Azores were occupied by forces of [[Philip II of Spain]]. Even before this time the Azores had always been cursed by pirates and privateers, who would attack by surprise during foggy days, under the cover of night or the light of day. They assaulted, robbed and sacked many of the communities along the coast, sometimes conscripting men to work as slaves. As legend tells, a pirate [[galleon]], commanded by a [[Moors|Moorish]] King attacked the island of Faial, but since the ship was spotted in time, the local population was given time to prepare. The pirates encountered stiff resistance and were forced to retreat without pillaging the homes along the northern coast.\n\nDuring the course of the retreat, the Moorish King lost his crown (made of silver and adorned with leaf in sparkling metal), after leaving it along a hedge-row while battling the defenders. Along the coast, the King remembered he had left his crown behind, and not wanting to lose his symbol of power, he resolved to return to the island. But, not wanting to be recognized as pirates they returned as local mariners. Not discovering the lost crown where he had left it, the group began to ask around but found no clues to its location. The local people began to get suspicious, and they were obliged to abandon their search and returned to their lands in [[North Africa]], from which they did not return.\n\nMeanwhile, the crown was discovered by a woman from Cedros, who, when she heard that they were searching for it, was suspicious that they were pirates and attempted to hide the crown. She wisely raised her skirt, and placed her leg through the ring-like crown, and passed unbeknownst to the pirates. Realizing the value of the object, and not wanting her contemporaries to know what she had hidden, she continued to wear the crown around her leg until it began to swell and hurt. In the end she informed the towns-people, who attempted to extricate the woman from the crown, washing her leg in water and ash soap to loosen it, but without success. In the end, the residents had no alternative but to cut the crown and later re-solder it cautiously. In the end the crown remained in the parish of Cedros and over time it was used in the feasts to the [[Cult of the Holy Spirit|Divine Holy Spirit]]. With the passing of time and fearful of damaging such a symbolic and rich object, a copy of the crown was created, and the original was hidden away and guarded. As the legend ends, the crown continues to be guarded every year at the home of the ''mordomo'' of the Holy Spirit feasts, and that the cuts are still visible around the crown. It is unknown whether any part of the above story is more than legend.<ref>\u00c2ngela Furtado-Brum, 1999, p. 255-256</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:FreguesiasCedros.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The northern coast of Cedros showing many of the communities and principal agglomerations]]\nCedros is one of the largest parishes on the island of Faial.  It is bordered on the east by [[Sal\u00e3o]] and west by [[Praia do Norte]] and extends from the coast to the center of the island (and the [[Cabe\u00e7o Gordo]] volcano).  Apart from the rich pasture-lands and hedged-fields in Alto do Inverno, Alto do Rigo or Cabe\u00e7a da Vaca, the coastal cliffs are approximately {{convert|75|to|271|m|ft}} above sea level (the highest coastal altitude in this parish being near Ribeira Funda).  The region is intersected by several rivers and valley creeks including ''Ribeira Funda'' (''the Deep Ravine''), ''Ribeira Pinheiro'' (''Pine Ravine'') and ''Ribeira Sousa'' (''Sousa Ravine'', named after one of the original settlers), which are usually dry throughout most of the year.\n\nThe population is concentrated along the Regional E.R. 1-1a Roadway that circles the island.  Pra\u00e7a (''village square'') is the more urbanized centre of parish, although most places are identified by the smaller neighbourhoods, or ''localities'' ({{lang-pt|lugares}}), where settlements developed, including Porto de Eira, Cabe\u00e7o, Cascalho, Cov\u00f5es and Ribeira Funda.  Uphill, a secondary road (linked to the E.R. 1-1\u00aa by the ''Canada da Sousa'', ''Rua de Igreja'' and ''Canada do Vale'') connects the ''localities'' of Canto, Janalves and Miragaia (colloquially known as the ''Rua de Cima'').  Each of these places have their own distinctions, and some include their own local pubs, community markets ({{lang-pt|mercearias}}) or religious sanctuaries (there are four ''imperios'' (temples to the Holy Spirit) in Cedros.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:FreguesiaCedros CALF.jpg|left|235px|thumb|CALF (''Cooperativa Agr\u00edcola dos Lact\u00edcinios do Faial'') expanded milk processing facilities, as seen along the E.R. Regional Road]]\nThe main economy in this area is agriculture.  The soil of the parish is fertile allowing the cultivation of various legumes and grains. Wheat, corn, beans, potatoes and sweet potatoes have been agricultural staples in the region over the decades. \n\nDairy production has also had an important role in the economy since this  northern coast was populated, but it only became an organized industry in the early 1920s. About this time an enterprising couple (Professor Constantino Magno do Amaral and D. Teresa) began a small factory in the area of ''Rua da Igreja'', eventually occupying the building currently \"occupied\" by Ethnographic Museum ('''Nulceu Etnogr\u00e1fico dos Cedros''') across from the main church. Later, a second firm, '''Castro, Merrinho & Xavier''' began operating in Cascalho, along ''Canada do In\u00eas''. Jos\u00e9 Freitas also developed a small business in ''Canto da Gatinha'', a group of investors started the '''Uni\u00e3o dos Lavradores''' that operated along the regional road, and the '''Uni\u00e3o Industrial Cedrenses''' (locally referred to as \"f\u00e1brica do Marujo\") was also formed in Pra\u00e7a (long after Professor Amaral's operation had ceased). By 1941 many of these operations had been bought or failed and the remaining businesses, Castro, Merrinho & Xavier and Uni\u00e3o Industrial, were being squeezed by low milk prices. It was then that a group of enterprising farmers, under the counsel of Professor Jos\u00e9 da Rosa Aica, banded together to form what would eventually be known as the cooperative '''CALF: the Cooperativa Agr\u00edcola dos Lact\u00edcinios do Faial'''. The idea of a cooperative spread quickly in the north of the island through the parishes, and it quickly became the largest enterprise on the island. Castro, Merrinho & Xavier was later purchased by a group from Lisbon to form '''Lacto A\u00e7oreana''', it lasted briefly, eventually coming under the control of a Horta businessman and failing. The Uni\u00e3o Industrial Cedrense was purchased by '''Martins & Rebello''', then the largest milk processor in Portugal, and moved to Cascalho (not too far from the Cooperativo) to occupy the old Castro, Merrinho & Xavier buildings. By 2004, the Cooperative had survived the competition, and restructured its operations to compete in the European market, expanding physically to handle the production. It is the principal business located in Cascalho, and responsible for the production and packaging of cheese and butter under the '''''Ilha Azul''''' label. In Cedros, Martins & Rebello did not survive the century. As part of its customer-driven re-inorientation, the factory once-again reintroduced its store-front cheese shop (abandoned during the late 20th century), and experimented with new variants for restaurants, such as their '''''Moledo''''' table cheese.<ref>{{citation |first=Maria Jos\u00e9 |last=Silva |title=CALF abre nova loja de vendas |publisher=Tribuna das Ilhas |location=Horta (Azores), Portugal |language=Portuguese |date=30 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nTourism has become the second local industry in the region.  \"Rural Tourism\", highlighted by the Nucleo Etnogr\u00e1fico dos Cedros and several renovated \"bed and breakfast\"-like cottages, attract visitors to this northern coast village.  The museum once included several examples of antique farm implements, equipment and tools used in daily life, as well as some pictures associated with the village and life in 19th-20th centuries. Currently, the Museum is in disuse, and most of the exhibits have been placed \"in storage\".\n\nThe area is served by several small shops, including bakery and pastry shop, hair-dressers, mechanical shops, car dealerships, restaurants (such as the ''Esconderijo''), and a supermarket (''Aldina Supermercado/Restaurante'') open in 2012, that serves both the local market of Cascalho and nuclear settlements of Cedros, as well as other parishes surrounding the civil parish.<ref>{{citation |title=Supermercado Aldina abre nos Cedros |first=Maria Jos\u00e9 |last=Silva |language=Portuguese |publisher=Tribuna das Ilhas |date=27 March 2012 |location=Horta (Azores), Portugal}}</ref>.

{"title_page": "4 Maccabees", "text_new": "{{Tanakh OT |deutero}}\nThe '''Fourth Book of Maccabees''', also called '''4 Maccabees''' is a [[homily]] or [[philosophy|philosophic]] discourse praising the supremacy of pious reason over passion. It was written in [[Koine Greek]] in the first or second century CE.\n\nIt is not in the Bible for most churches, but is an appendix to the Greek Bible, and in the [[biblical canon|canon]] of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Orthodox]] Bible.  It was included in the 1688 [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] and the 18th-century [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Catholic]] Bibles where it was called \"Iosip\" (''Joseph''). It is no longer printed in [[Bible translations into Romanian|Romanian Bibles]] today.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:De in de tempel opgesloten Joodse priesters trachten zich voor het paasfeest van offerdieren te voorzien, RP-P-OB-44.715.jpg|thumb|The Jewish priests trapped in the temple seek out animals for the Passover sacrifice]]\nThe work consists of a prologue and two main sections; the first advances the philosophical thesis while the second illustrates the points made using examples drawn from [[2 Maccabees]] (principally, the [[martyr]]dom of Eleazer and the Maccabean youths) under [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]]. The last chapters concern the author's impressions drawn from these martyrdoms. The work thus appears to be an independent composition to [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]], merely drawing on their descriptions to support its thesis.  It was composed originally in the [[Koine Greek|Greek language]], in what Stephen Westerholm of the [[Eastern / Greek Orthodox Bible]] calls \"very fluently... and in a highly rhetorical and affected Greek style.\"\n\n==Authorship and criticism==\nAccording to some scholars, the last chapter shows signs of later addition to the work, though this was disputed by the 19th century authors of the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]. The dispute is based on the weak ending the book would have without the \"added\" chapter, as well as arguments based on style. The change of direction with chapter 17 supports the view of the work as a homily held before a Greek-speaking audience on the feast of [[Hanukkah]], as advanced by Ewald and Freudenthal, where this would be a rhetorical element to draw the listeners into the discourse. Others hold that a homily would have to be based on scriptural texts, which this work is only loosely.\n\nIn style, the book is [[Public speaking|oratorical]], but not so much as [[3 Maccabees]]. What can be interpreted as [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] is cited by the author, though there is little original philosophical insight in the text. Although its Hellenistic Jewish nature assumes an origin in [[Alexandria]], its interest in martyrs in Antioch and its similarity to writings in modern Turkey point to an origin in the northeast Mediterranean. Regarded as Jewish literature, it is cited{{by whom|date=February 2016}} as the best example of [[syncretism]] between Jewish and Hellenistic thought.\n\nThe book is ascribed to [[Josephus]] by [[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]],<ref>\"The Books of the Maccabees\" by John R Bartlett, ''The Oxford Companion to the Bible'', ed. by [[Bruce M. Metzger]] and [[Michael D. Coogan]], ([[Oxford University Press]], 1993, {{ISBN|0-19-504645-5}}) p.482</ref> and this opinion was accepted for many years, leading to its inclusion in many editions of Josephus' works. Scholars have however  pointed to perceived differences of language and style. The book is generally dated between 20 and 130 CE, likely in the later half of that range.\n\n==Doctrinal content==\nThe writer believes in the [[immortality]] of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], but never mentions the resurrection of the dead.<ref>The Access Bible (Oxford University Press, 1999), Apocrypha 330.</ref> Good souls are said to live forever in happiness with the [[patriarchs]] and [[God]], but even the evil souls are held to be immortal.
