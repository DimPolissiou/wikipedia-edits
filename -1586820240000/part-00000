{"title_page": "Sabbath in Christianity", "text_new": "'''Sabbath in Christianity''' is the inclusion in Christianity of Sabbath in the sense of a day set aside for rest and worship by God for all humanity on the 7th Creation day according to Genesis 2:2,3. This practice was established at Creation, and reemphasized in  the commandment to \"[[remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy]]\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Exodus|20:8}}</ref> and God's blessing of the seventh day ([[Saturday]]) making it holy, \"because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]]\".<ref>{{bibleref2|Genesis|2:3}}</ref> The practice is associated with the assembly of the people to worship and is a sign between God and His people according to Exodus 31:12-18.\n\nThe position now dominant in [[Christianity]] is that inaccurate observance of [[Sunday]], has supplanted or [[supersessionism|superseded]] the Lord\u2019s seventh-day sabbath instituted at Creation for all men, and noted in the 10 commandments.\n\n==History==\n\n===Sabbath timing===\n{{See also|Shabbat}}\n\nThe Hebrew Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, is often spoken of loosely as \"Saturday\" but in the [[Hebrew calendar]] a day begins at sunset and not at midnight. The Sabbath therefore coincides with what is now commonly identified as Friday sunset to Saturday night when three stars are visible in the night sky. Similarly, the Hebrew first day of the week (\"Sunday\") extends from sunset on (in common parlance) Saturday evening to sunset on what is generally called Sunday evening. The Sabbath continued to be observed on the seventh day in the early Christian church.{{NoteTag|The civil calendar of the ancient Roman Empire, the [[Julian calendar]] (founded in 45 BC), marked days loosely in general practice, since the timing of midnight was difficult to determine widely at that time. Thus, the early church easily adopted for its own use the Hebrew calendar's sunset-to-sunset formula for marking the days, even after it began to calculate Easter according to the Julian calendar. Its daily cycle of church services began with Vespers, which was often celebrated just after sunset, in the early evening. This pattern made its way into both Roman and Eastern liturgical practice, and continues in use in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] to this day.}} To this day, the liturgical day continues to be observed in line with the Hebrew reckoning in the church calendars in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]].<ref>Canon of Holy Saturday (Orthodox), Kontakion: \"Exceeding blessed is this Sabbath, on which Christ has slumbered, to rise on the third day.\"</ref> In the [[Latin Church]], \"the liturgical day runs from midnight to midnight.

Such writing, however, did serve to deepen the idea of Christian rest on Sunday, and its practice increased in prominence throughout the early [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=Bauckham3/>\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]] is an expression of natural law which binds all men, and therefore the Sabbath commandment is a moral requirement along with the other nine. Thus in the West, Sunday rest became more closely associated with a Christian application of the Sabbath, a development towards the idea of a \"Christian Sabbath\" rather than a Hebrew one.<ref name=Bauckham3>{{cite book|chapter=Sabbath and Sunday in the Medieval Church in the West|first=R.J.|last=Bauckham|title=From Sabbath to Lord's Day|editor1-first=Don A|editor1-last=Carson|year=1982|pages=299\u2013310|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers/Zondervan|editor-link=Don Carson|isbn=978-1-57910-307-1}}</ref> While Sunday worship and Sunday rest combined powerfully to relate to Sabbath commandment precepts, the application of the commandment to Christian life was nevertheless a response within the law of liberty, not restricted to a single day but continuous, and not a displacement of the Sabbath in time.\n\n====Continuations of Hebrew practices====\n{{primary sources|section|date=September 2018}}\nSeventh-day Sabbath was observed at least sporadically by a minority of groups during the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the early church in Ireland, there is evidence that a sabbath-rest on Saturday may have been kept along with mass on Sunday as the 'Lord's day'. It appears that many of the canon laws in Ireland from that period were derived from parts of the laws of Moses. In Adomnan of Iona's biography of [[St Columba]] it describes Columba's death by having Columba say on a Saturday 'Today is truly my sabbath, for it is my last day in this wearisome life, when I shall keep the Sabbath after my troublesome labours. At midnight this Sunday, as Scripture saith, \"I shall go the way of my fathers\"' and he then dies that night. The identification of this sabbath day as a Saturday in the narrative is clear in the context, because Columba is recorded as seeing an angel at the mass on the previous Sunday and the narrative claims he dies in the same week, on the sabbath day at the end of the week, during the 'Lord's night' (referring to Saturday night-Sunday morning).<ref>Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995</ref>\n\nAn Eastern body of Christian Sabbath-keepers mentioned from the 8th century to the 12th is called Athenians (\"touch-not\") because they abstained from uncleanness and intoxicating drinks, called Athinginians in Neander: \"This sect, which had its principal seat in the city of Armorion, in upper Phrygia, where many Jews resided, sprung out of a mixture of Judaism and Christianity. They united baptism with the observance of all the rites of Judaism, circumcision excepted. We may perhaps recognize a branch of the older Judaizing sects.<ref>Neander, fourth period, 6, 428.</ref>\n\nCardinal Hergenrother says that they stood in intimate relation with Emperor Michael II (AD 821-829), and testifies that they observed Sabbath.<ref>Kirchengeschichte, I, 527</ref> As late as the 11th century Cardinal Humbert still referred to the Nazarenes as a Sabbath-keeping Christian body existing at that time. But in the 10th and 11th centuries, there was a great extension of sects from the East to the West. Neander states that the corruption of the clergy furnished a most important vantage-ground on which to attack the dominant church. The abstemious life of these Christians, the simplicity and earnestness of their preaching and teaching, had their effect. \"Thus we find them emerging at once in the 11th century, in countries the most diverse, and the most remote from each other, in Italy, France, and even in the Harz districts in Germany.\" Likewise, also, \"traces of Sabbath-keepers are found in the times of Gregory I, Gregory VII, and in the 12th century in Lombardy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dedication.www3.50megs.com/historyofsabbath/hos_twentyone_b.html#027|title=SABBATH DURING THE DARK AGES|website=dedication.www3.50megs.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===\nThe [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] churches celebrate the Sabbath, a practice proselytised in the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] church in Ethiopia in the 1300s by [[Ewostatewos]] ({{lang-gez|\u12ee\u1235\u1323\u1274\u12ce\u1235}}, {{lang-grc|\u0395\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}}<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Marcus|first=Harold G.|title=A History of Ethiopia|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofethiopi00marc|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofethiopi00marc/page/24 24]|year=1994|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08121-5}}</ref>).

The [[Puritans]] of England and Scotland brought a new rigorism into the observance of the Christian Lord's Day in reaction to the customary Sunday observance of the time, which they regarded as lax. They appealed to Sabbath ordinances with the idea that only the Bible can bind men's consciences on whether or how they will take a break from work, or to impose an obligation to meet at a particular time. Their influential reasoning spread to other denominations also, and it is primarily through their influence that \"Sabbath\" has become the colloquial equivalent of \"Lord's Day\" or \"Sunday\". Sunday Sabbatarianism is enshrined in its most mature expression, the ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'' (1646), in the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theological tradition. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of Chapter 21 (''Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath Day'') read:<blockquote>7. As it is the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for the worship of God; so, in his Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him: which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week; and, from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week, which, in Scripture, is called the Lord's day, and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath.<br /><br />8. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe a holy rest, all the day, from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations, but also are taken up, the whole time, in the public and private exercises of his worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Confession_of_Faith_of_the_Assembly_of_Divines_at_Westminster#Chapter_21|title=The Confession of Faith of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster|last=Assembly|first=Westminster}}</ref></blockquote>The confession holds that not only is work forbidden on Sunday, but also \"works, words, and thoughts\" about \"worldly employments and recreations.\" Instead, the whole day should be taken up with \"public and private exercises of [one's] worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Confession_of_Faith_of_the_Assembly_of_Divines_at_Westminster#Chapter_21|title=The Confession of Faith of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster|last=Assembly|first=Westminster}}</ref>\n\nStrict Sunday Sabbatarianism is sometimes called \"Puritan Sabbath\", which may be contrasted with \"Continental Sabbath\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Marsden|first=George|author-link=George Marsden|title=Understanding Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism|year=1991|publisher=[[William B.

This non-Sabbatarian interpretation usually states that Jesus's obedience and the [[New Covenant]] fulfilled the laws of Sabbath, the [[Ten Commandments]], and the [[Law of Moses]], which are thus considered not to be binding moral laws, and sometimes considered abolished or [[abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogated]]. While Sunday is often observed as the day of Christian assembly and worship, in accordance with church tradition, Sabbath commandments are dissociated from this practice.\n\nNon-Sabbatarian Christians also cite {{Bibleverse|2|Cor.|3:2-3}}, in which believers are compared to \"a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written ... not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts\"; this interpretation states that Christians accordingly no longer follow the Ten Commandments with dead orthodoxy (\"tablets of stone\"), but follow a new law written upon \"tablets of human hearts\". {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Cor.|3:7-11}} adds that \"if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory ..., will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? .... And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!\" This is interpreted as teaching that [[New Covenant]] Christians are not bound by the Mosaic Law, and that Sabbath-keeping is not required. Further, because \"love is the fulfillment of the law\" ({{Bibleverse||Rom.|13:10}}), the new-covenant \"law\" is considered to be based entirely upon love and to rescind Sabbath requirements.\n\n===Spiritual rest===\nNon-Sabbatarians who affirm that Sabbath-keeping remains for God's people (as in {{Bibleverse||Heb.|3:7-4:11}}) frequently regard this as present weeklong spiritual rest or future heavenly rest rather than as physical weekly rest. For instance, [[Irenaeus]] saw Sabbath rest from secular affairs for one day each week as a sign of the way that Christians were called to permanently devote themselves to God<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Against Heresies|volume=3.16.1|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vi.xvii.html}}</ref> and an eschatological symbol.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Against Heresies|volume=4.33.2|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.xxxiv.html}}</ref> One such interpretation of Hebrews states that seventh-day Sabbath is no longer relevant as a regular, literal day of rest, but instead is a [[typology (theology)|symbolic metaphor]] for the eternal salvation \"rest\" that Christians enjoy in Christ, which was in turn prefigured by the promised land of Canaan. {{quote|\"The NT indicates that the sabbath followed its own channel and found its goal in Christ's redemptive work [John 5:17, cf. 7:23, Colossians 2:16, Matthew 11:28\u201312:14, Hebrews 3:7\u20134:11]. It is true to the NT to say that the Mosaic sabbath as a legal and weekly matter was a temporary symbol of a more fundamental and comprehensive salvation, epitomized by and grounded in God's own creation sabbath, and brought to fulfillment (in already\u2013not yet fashion) in Christ's redemptive work. Believers are indeed to 'keep sabbath,' no longer by observance of a day of the week but now by the upholding of that to which it pointed: the gospel of the [Kingdom of God].\"<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Martin, R.

While first-day Sabbatarian practice declined during the 18th century, leaving few modern followers, its concern for stricter Sunday observances did have influence in the west, shaping the origin of the Christian Sabbath. The term no longer applies to a specific set of practices, but tends to be used to describe the general establishment of Sunday worship and rest observances within Christianity. It does not necessarily imply the displacement of the Sabbath itself, which is often recognized as remaining on Saturday. As such, the Christian Sabbath generally represents a reinterpretation of the meaning of the Sabbath in the light of Christian law, emphases of practice, and values.\n\n===Roman Catholicism===\nIn 1998 [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote an [[apostolic letter]] ''Dies Domini'',<ref>https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_05071998_dies-domini_en.html</ref> \"on keeping the Lord's day holy\".

But you may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify.|''Faith of Our Fathers'', Cardinal Gibbons, p. 72 <ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.cathcorn.org/foof/8.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829064557/http://www.cathcorn.org/foof/8.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-08-29|author=Gibbons, James|title=Faith of Our Fathers|chapter=VIII. The Church and the Bible|page=72|date=1917}}. First published in 1876.</ref>|}}\n\n===Eastern Orthodoxy===\nOrthodox Sunday worship is not a direct Sabbath observance. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] observes the first day (liturgical Sunday, beginning Saturday evening) as a weekly feast, the remembrance of Christ's resurrection, and a mini-[[Easter|Pascha]]. As such, it tends to hold the first place within a week's observances, sharing that place only with other major feasts which occur from time to time. The Divine Liturgy is always celebrated, joining the participants on earth with those who offer the worship in God's kingdom, and hence joining the first day to the [[The eighth day (Christian)|eighth day]], wherein the communion of the whole Church with Christ is fully realized. As such, it is never surpassed as a time for the Orthodox to assemble in worship.\n\nThe Church affirms its authority to appoint the time of this feast (and all observances) as deriving from the authority given to the apostles and passed to the bishops through the [[laying-on of hands]], for the sake of the governance of the Church on earth, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit ({{bibleref2|John|20:22|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|John|14:26|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|Rom.|6:14-18|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|Rom.|7:6|NKJV}}). It does not treat Sunday worship as a transference of Sabbath worship, but identifies the Sabbath, still on Saturday, as a Biblical \"type\", a precursor, realized fully only after Christ's fulfillment of the Mosaic Law ({{bibleref2|Mat.|5:17-18|NKJV}}). Thus, the Sabbath and the Mosaic Law both remain as a teacher, reminding Christians to worship in holiness, but now according to grace, in Christian observations and Sunday worship.\n\nThe grace received in baptism binds the Church to Christ, Who has given his people the freedom to seek him directly in relationship, not to pursue whatever suits one's fancy. The goal of that freedom is always union with Christ in [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]], and the maintenance of that union all the time, throughout this life and into the next, which is sometimes described as the \"sanctification of time\". Grace therefore never permits of whatever is sinful or unhelpful to salvation, such as laziness or hedonistic revelry. Rather, it becomes a stricter guide for behavior than any legal code, even the Mosaic, and disciplines the believer in some degree of ascetic endeavor ({{bibleref2|Rom.|6:14-18|NKJV}}).<ref>{{citation |title=Orthodox Study Bible |publisher=St. Athanasius Academy of Orthodox Theology |year=2008 |page=1533 |ref=none}}</ref>\n\nOrthodoxy recognizes no mandated time for rest, a day or any other span, but the Church leads the individual to holiness in different ways, and recognizes the need for [[Economy (religion)|economy]] and for rest. Activities such as sleep, relaxation, and recreation become a matter of balance and proper handling, and acceptance of God's mercy. [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil the Great]] expresses thanks for this in a prayer often said by Orthodox Christians in the morning, after rising: \"You do we bless, O Most High God and Lord of mercy, ... Who has given unto us sleep for rest from our infirmity, and for repose of our much-toiling flesh.\"<ref>{{citation |title=A Prayer Book for Orthodox Christians |publisher=Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Boston, MA |year=1987 |p=7 |ref=none }}</ref> In recognition of God's gifts, therefore, the Church welcomes and supports civil laws that provide a day away from labor, which then become opportunities for Christians to pray, rest, and engage in acts of mercy. In grace do Christians respond, remembering both the example of the Sabbath rest, and Christ's lordship ({{bibleref2|Mk.|2:21-28}}).\n\n====Eastern Christianity and Saturday vs. Sunday observances====\nEastern Orthodox and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] distinguish between the \"Sabbath\" (Saturday) and the \"Lord's Day\" (Sunday), and both continue to play a special role for the faithful. Many parishes and monasteries will serve the [[Divine Liturgy]] on both Saturday morning and Sunday morning. The church never allows strict fasting on any Saturday (except [[Holy Saturday]]) or Sunday, and the fasting rules on those Saturdays and Sundays which fall during one of the fasting seasons (such as [[Great Lent]], [[Apostles' Fast]], etc.) are always relaxed to some degree. During Great Lent, when the celebration of the Liturgy is forbidden on weekdays, there is always Liturgy on Saturday as well as Sunday. The church also has a special cycle of Bible readings ([[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]]) for Saturdays and Sundays which is different from the cycle of readings allotted to weekdays. However, the Lord's Day, being a celebration of the Resurrection, is clearly given more emphasis. For instance, in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] Sunday is always observed with an [[all-night vigil]] on Saturday night, and in all of the Eastern Churches it is amplified with special hymns which are chanted only on Sunday. If a [[feast day]] falls on a Sunday it is always combined with the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|hymns for Sunday]] (unless it is a [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Lord's Great Feast]]). Saturday is celebrated as a sort of [[afterfeast]] for the previous Sunday, on which several of the hymns from the previous Sunday are repeated.\n\nIn part, Eastern Christians continue to celebrate Saturday as Sabbath because of its role in the history of salvation: it was on a Saturday that Jesus \"rested\" in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|cave tomb]] after the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. For this reason also, Saturday is a day for general [[prayer for the dead|commemoration of the departed]], and special [[Memorial service (Orthodox)|requiem hymns]] are often chanted on this day. Orthodox Christians make time to help the poor and needy as well on this day.\n\n===Lutheranism===\n[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] founder [[Martin Luther]] stated \"I wonder exceedingly how it came to be imputed to me that I should reject the law of Ten Commandments...Whosoever abrogates the law must of necessity abrogate sin also.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Martin Luther, Spiritual Antichrist|pages=71\u20132}}</ref> The Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]], speaking of changes made by Roman Catholic pontiffs, states: \"They refer to the Sabbath-day as having been changed into the Lord's Day, contrary to the Decalog, as it seems.

Latter Day Saints believe this means performing no labor that would keep them from giving their full attention to spiritual matters (Ex. 20:10). LDS prophets have described this as meaning they should not shop, hunt, fish, attend sports events, or participate in similar activities on that day. Elder [[Spencer W.

Mostly [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Seventh-day Sabbatarians]], they broke away from their former churches to form communities that followed Seventh-day Sabbath-based practices that differed from the rest of Christianity, often also adopting a more literal interpretation of law, either Christian or Mosaic.\n\n==History==\n\n===Sabbath timing===\n{{See also|Shabbat}}\n\nThe Hebrew Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, is often spoken of loosely as \"Saturday\" but in the [[Hebrew calendar]] a day begins at sunset and not at midnight. The Sabbath therefore coincides with what is now commonly identified as Friday sunset to Saturday night when three stars are visible in the night sky. Similarly, the Hebrew first day of the week (\"Sunday\") extends from sunset on (in common parlance) Saturday evening to sunset on what is generally called Sunday evening. The Sabbath continued to be observed on the seventh day in the early Christian church.{{NoteTag|The civil calendar of the ancient Roman Empire, the [[Julian calendar]] (founded in 45 BC), marked days loosely in general practice, since the timing of midnight was difficult to determine widely at that time. Thus, the early church easily adopted for its own use the Hebrew calendar's sunset-to-sunset formula for marking the days, even after it began to calculate Easter according to the Julian calendar. Its daily cycle of church services began with Vespers, which was often celebrated just after sunset, in the early evening. This pattern made its way into both Roman and Eastern liturgical practice, and continues in use in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] to this day.}} To this day, the liturgical day continues to be observed in line with the Hebrew reckoning in the church calendars in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]].<ref>Canon of Holy Saturday (Orthodox), Kontakion: \"Exceeding blessed is this Sabbath, on which Christ has slumbered, to rise on the third day.\"</ref> In the [[Latin Church]], \"the liturgical day runs from midnight to midnight.

On March 7, 321, however, [[Constantine the Great|Roman Emperor Constantine I]] issued a civil decree making Sunday a day of rest from labor, stating:<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph Cullen|last=Ayer|title=A Source Book for Ancient Church History|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1913|volume=2.1.1.59g|pages=284\u20135}}</ref> {{quote|All judges and city people and the craftsmen shall rest upon the venerable day of the sun.

At Laodicea also, the Church encouraged Christians to make use of the day for Christian rest where possible,<ref name=Laodicea29/> without ascribing to it any of the regulation of Mosaic Law, and indeed, anathematizing Hebrew observance on the Sabbath. The civil law and its effects made possible a pattern in Church life that has been imitated throughout the centuries in many places and cultures, wherever possible.\n\n===From ancient times to Middle Ages===\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] followed the early patristic writers in spiritualizing the meaning of the Sabbath commandment, referring it to eschatological rest rather than observance of a literal day. Such writing, however, did serve to deepen the idea of Christian rest on Sunday, and its practice increased in prominence throughout the early [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=Bauckham3/>\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]] is an expression of natural law which binds all men, and therefore the Sabbath commandment is a moral requirement along with the other nine. Thus in the West, Sunday rest became more closely associated with a Christian application of the Sabbath, a development towards the idea of a \"Christian Sabbath\" rather than a Hebrew one.<ref name=Bauckham3>{{cite book|chapter=Sabbath and Sunday in the Medieval Church in the West|first=R.J.|last=Bauckham|title=From Sabbath to Lord's Day|editor1-first=Don A|editor1-last=Carson|year=1982|pages=299\u2013310|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers/Zondervan|editor-link=Don Carson|isbn=978-1-57910-307-1}}</ref> While Sunday worship and Sunday rest combined powerfully to relate to Sabbath commandment precepts, the application of the commandment to Christian life was nevertheless a response within the law of liberty, not restricted to a single day but continuous, and not a displacement of the Sabbath in time.\n\n====Continuations of Hebrew practices====\n{{primary sources|section|date=September 2018}}\nSeventh-day Sabbath was observed at least sporadically by a minority of groups during the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the early church in Ireland, there is evidence that a sabbath-rest on Saturday may have been kept along with mass on Sunday as the 'Lord's day'. It appears that many of the canon laws in Ireland from that period were derived from parts of the laws of Moses. In Adomnan of Iona's biography of [[St Columba]] it describes Columba's death by having Columba say on a Saturday 'Today is truly my sabbath, for it is my last day in this wearisome life, when I shall keep the Sabbath after my troublesome labours. At midnight this Sunday, as Scripture saith, \"I shall go the way of my fathers\"' and he then dies that night. The identification of this sabbath day as a Saturday in the narrative is clear in the context, because Columba is recorded as seeing an angel at the mass on the previous Sunday and the narrative claims he dies in the same week, on the sabbath day at the end of the week, during the 'Lord's night' (referring to Saturday night-Sunday morning).<ref>Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995</ref>\n\nAn Eastern body of Christian Sabbath-keepers mentioned from the 8th century to the 12th is called Athenians (\"touch-not\") because they abstained from uncleanness and intoxicating drinks, called Athinginians in Neander: \"This sect, which had its principal seat in the city of Armorion, in upper Phrygia, where many Jews resided, sprung out of a mixture of Judaism and Christianity. They united baptism with the observance of all the rites of Judaism, circumcision excepted. We may perhaps recognize a branch of the older Judaizing sects.<ref>Neander, fourth period, 6, 428.</ref>\n\nCardinal Hergenrother says that they stood in intimate relation with Emperor Michael II (AD 821-829), and testifies that they observed Sabbath.<ref>Kirchengeschichte, I, 527</ref> As late as the 11th century Cardinal Humbert still referred to the Nazarenes as a Sabbath-keeping Christian body existing at that time. But in the 10th and 11th centuries, there was a great extension of sects from the East to the West. Neander states that the corruption of the clergy furnished a most important vantage-ground on which to attack the dominant church.

The [[Puritans]] of England and Scotland brought a new rigorism into the observance of the Christian Lord's Day in reaction to the customary Sunday observance of the time, which they regarded as lax. They appealed to Sabbath ordinances with the idea that only the Bible can bind men's consciences on whether or how they will take a break from work, or to impose an obligation to meet at a particular time. Their influential reasoning spread to other denominations also, and it is primarily through their influence that \"Sabbath\" has become the colloquial equivalent of \"Lord's Day\" or \"Sunday\". Sunday Sabbatarianism is enshrined in its most mature expression, the ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'' (1646), in the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theological tradition. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of Chapter 21 (''Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath Day'') read:<blockquote>7. As it is the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for the worship of God; so, in his Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him: which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week; and, from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week, which, in Scripture, is called the Lord's day, and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath.<br /><br />8. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe a holy rest, all the day, from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations, but also are taken up, the whole time, in the public and private exercises of his worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Confession_of_Faith_of_the_Assembly_of_Divines_at_Westminster#Chapter_21|title=The Confession of Faith of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster|last=Assembly|first=Westminster}}</ref></blockquote>The confession holds that not only is work forbidden on Sunday, but also \"works, words, and thoughts\" about \"worldly employments and recreations.\" Instead, the whole day should be taken up with \"public and private exercises of [one's] worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Confession_of_Faith_of_the_Assembly_of_Divines_at_Westminster#Chapter_21|title=The Confession of Faith of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster|last=Assembly|first=Westminster}}</ref>\n\nStrict Sunday Sabbatarianism is sometimes called \"Puritan Sabbath\", which may be contrasted with \"Continental Sabbath\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Marsden|first=George|author-link=George Marsden|title=Understanding Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism|year=1991|publisher=[[William B.

This non-Sabbatarian interpretation usually states that Jesus's obedience and the [[New Covenant]] fulfilled the laws of Sabbath, the [[Ten Commandments]], and the [[Law of Moses]], which are thus considered not to be binding moral laws, and sometimes considered abolished or [[abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogated]]. While Sunday is often observed as the day of Christian assembly and worship, in accordance with church tradition, Sabbath commandments are dissociated from this practice.\n\nNon-Sabbatarian Christians also cite {{Bibleverse|2|Cor.|3:2-3}}, in which believers are compared to \"a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written ... not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts\"; this interpretation states that Christians accordingly no longer follow the Ten Commandments with dead orthodoxy (\"tablets of stone\"), but follow a new law written upon \"tablets of human hearts\". {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Cor.|3:7-11}} adds that \"if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory ..., will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? .... And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!\" This is interpreted as teaching that [[New Covenant]] Christians are not bound by the Mosaic Law, and that Sabbath-keeping is not required. Further, because \"love is the fulfillment of the law\" ({{Bibleverse||Rom.|13:10}}), the new-covenant \"law\" is considered to be based entirely upon love and to rescind Sabbath requirements.\n\n===Spiritual rest===\nNon-Sabbatarians who affirm that Sabbath-keeping remains for God's people (as in {{Bibleverse||Heb.|3:7-4:11}}) frequently regard this as present weeklong spiritual rest or future heavenly rest rather than as physical weekly rest. For instance, [[Irenaeus]] saw Sabbath rest from secular affairs for one day each week as a sign of the way that Christians were called to permanently devote themselves to God<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Against Heresies|volume=3.16.1|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vi.xvii.html}}</ref> and an eschatological symbol.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Against Heresies|volume=4.33.2|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.xxxiv.html}}</ref> One such interpretation of Hebrews states that seventh-day Sabbath is no longer relevant as a regular, literal day of rest, but instead is a [[typology (theology)|symbolic metaphor]] for the eternal salvation \"rest\" that Christians enjoy in Christ, which was in turn prefigured by the promised land of Canaan. {{quote|\"The NT indicates that the sabbath followed its own channel and found its goal in Christ's redemptive work [John 5:17, cf. 7:23, Colossians 2:16, Matthew 11:28\u201312:14, Hebrews 3:7\u20134:11]. It is true to the NT to say that the Mosaic sabbath as a legal and weekly matter was a temporary symbol of a more fundamental and comprehensive salvation, epitomized by and grounded in God's own creation sabbath, and brought to fulfillment (in already\u2013not yet fashion) in Christ's redemptive work. Believers are indeed to 'keep sabbath,' no longer by observance of a day of the week but now by the upholding of that to which it pointed: the gospel of the [Kingdom of God].\"<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Martin, R.

While first-day Sabbatarian practice declined during the 18th century, leaving few modern followers, its concern for stricter Sunday observances did have influence in the west, shaping the origin of the Christian Sabbath. The term no longer applies to a specific set of practices, but tends to be used to describe the general establishment of Sunday worship and rest observances within Christianity. It does not necessarily imply the displacement of the Sabbath itself, which is often recognized as remaining on Saturday. As such, the Christian Sabbath generally represents a reinterpretation of the meaning of the Sabbath in the light of Christian law, emphases of practice, and values.\n\n===Roman Catholicism===\nIn 1998 [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote an [[apostolic letter]] ''Dies Domini'',<ref>https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_05071998_dies-domini_en.html</ref> \"on keeping the Lord's day holy\". He encourages Catholics to remember the importance of keeping Sunday holy, urging that it not lose its meaning by being blended with a frivolous \"[[Workweek and weekend|weekend]]\" mentality.\n\nGoing beyond the traditional Catholic position and seeing to uphold the [[Lord's Day Act]] in [[French Quebec]], the Catholic Sunday League was formed in 1923 to promote first-day sabbatarian restrictions in the province, especially against movie theaters.<ref name=\"Roy2005\">{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Christian|title=Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia|url=https://archive.org/details/traditionalfesti0000royc/page/457|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|language=English|isbn=9781576070895|page=[https://archive.org/details/traditionalfesti0000royc/page/457 457]|quote=However, an amendment was made that left is enforcement to the discretion of the provinces, so that it remained a dead letter in mostly French Quebec.

The Church and the Bible|page=72|date=1917}}. First published in 1876.</ref>|}}\n\n===Eastern Orthodoxy===\nOrthodox Sunday worship is not a direct Sabbath observance. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] observes the first day (liturgical Sunday, beginning Saturday evening) as a weekly feast, the remembrance of Christ's resurrection, and a mini-[[Easter|Pascha]]. As such, it tends to hold the first place within a week's observances, sharing that place only with other major feasts which occur from time to time. The Divine Liturgy is always celebrated, joining the participants on earth with those who offer the worship in God's kingdom, and hence joining the first day to the [[The eighth day (Christian)|eighth day]], wherein the communion of the whole Church with Christ is fully realized. As such, it is never surpassed as a time for the Orthodox to assemble in worship.\n\nThe Church affirms its authority to appoint the time of this feast (and all observances) as deriving from the authority given to the apostles and passed to the bishops through the [[laying-on of hands]], for the sake of the governance of the Church on earth, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit ({{bibleref2|John|20:22|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|John|14:26|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|Rom.|6:14-18|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|Rom.|7:6|NKJV}}). It does not treat Sunday worship as a transference of Sabbath worship, but identifies the Sabbath, still on Saturday, as a Biblical \"type\", a precursor, realized fully only after Christ's fulfillment of the Mosaic Law ({{bibleref2|Mat.|5:17-18|NKJV}}). Thus, the Sabbath and the Mosaic Law both remain as a teacher, reminding Christians to worship in holiness, but now according to grace, in Christian observations and Sunday worship.\n\nThe grace received in baptism binds the Church to Christ, Who has given his people the freedom to seek him directly in relationship, not to pursue whatever suits one's fancy. The goal of that freedom is always union with Christ in [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]], and the maintenance of that union all the time, throughout this life and into the next, which is sometimes described as the \"sanctification of time\". Grace therefore never permits of whatever is sinful or unhelpful to salvation, such as laziness or hedonistic revelry. Rather, it becomes a stricter guide for behavior than any legal code, even the Mosaic, and disciplines the believer in some degree of ascetic endeavor ({{bibleref2|Rom.|6:14-18|NKJV}}).<ref>{{citation |title=Orthodox Study Bible |publisher=St. Athanasius Academy of Orthodox Theology |year=2008 |page=1533 |ref=none}}</ref>\n\nOrthodoxy recognizes no mandated time for rest, a day or any other span, but the Church leads the individual to holiness in different ways, and recognizes the need for [[Economy (religion)|economy]] and for rest. Activities such as sleep, relaxation, and recreation become a matter of balance and proper handling, and acceptance of God's mercy. [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil the Great]] expresses thanks for this in a prayer often said by Orthodox Christians in the morning, after rising: \"You do we bless, O Most High God and Lord of mercy, ... Who has given unto us sleep for rest from our infirmity, and for repose of our much-toiling flesh.\"<ref>{{citation |title=A Prayer Book for Orthodox Christians |publisher=Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Boston, MA |year=1987 |p=7 |ref=none }}</ref> In recognition of God's gifts, therefore, the Church welcomes and supports civil laws that provide a day away from labor, which then become opportunities for Christians to pray, rest, and engage in acts of mercy. In grace do Christians respond, remembering both the example of the Sabbath rest, and Christ's lordship ({{bibleref2|Mk.|2:21-28}}).\n\n====Eastern Christianity and Saturday vs. Sunday observances====\nEastern Orthodox and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] distinguish between the \"Sabbath\" (Saturday) and the \"Lord's Day\" (Sunday), and both continue to play a special role for the faithful. Many parishes and monasteries will serve the [[Divine Liturgy]] on both Saturday morning and Sunday morning. The church never allows strict fasting on any Saturday (except [[Holy Saturday]]) or Sunday, and the fasting rules on those Saturdays and Sundays which fall during one of the fasting seasons (such as [[Great Lent]], [[Apostles' Fast]], etc.) are always relaxed to some degree. During Great Lent, when the celebration of the Liturgy is forbidden on weekdays, there is always Liturgy on Saturday as well as Sunday. The church also has a special cycle of Bible readings ([[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]]) for Saturdays and Sundays which is different from the cycle of readings allotted to weekdays. However, the Lord's Day, being a celebration of the Resurrection, is clearly given more emphasis. For instance, in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] Sunday is always observed with an [[all-night vigil]] on Saturday night, and in all of the Eastern Churches it is amplified with special hymns which are chanted only on Sunday. If a [[feast day]] falls on a Sunday it is always combined with the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|hymns for Sunday]] (unless it is a [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Lord's Great Feast]]). Saturday is celebrated as a sort of [[afterfeast]] for the previous Sunday, on which several of the hymns from the previous Sunday are repeated.\n\nIn part, Eastern Christians continue to celebrate Saturday as Sabbath because of its role in the history of salvation: it was on a Saturday that Jesus \"rested\" in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|cave tomb]] after the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. For this reason also, Saturday is a day for general [[prayer for the dead|commemoration of the departed]], and special [[Memorial service (Orthodox)|requiem hymns]] are often chanted on this day. Orthodox Christians make time to help the poor and needy as well on this day.\n\n===Lutheranism===\n[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] founder [[Martin Luther]] stated \"I wonder exceedingly how it came to be imputed to me that I should reject the law of Ten Commandments...Whosoever abrogates the law must of necessity abrogate sin also.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Martin Luther, Spiritual Antichrist|pages=71\u20132}}</ref> The Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]], speaking of changes made by Roman Catholic pontiffs, states: \"They refer to the Sabbath-day as having been changed into the Lord's Day, contrary to the Decalog, as it seems.

Latter Day Saints believe this means performing no labor that would keep them from giving their full attention to spiritual matters (Ex. 20:10). LDS prophets have described this as meaning they should not shop, hunt, fish, attend sports events, or participate in similar activities on that day. Elder [[Spencer W.

[[Jesus]]'s parable of the [[Pharisee and the Publican]] describes the [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] as fasting \"twice a week\" (Greek ''dis tou sabbatou'', literally, \"twice of the Sabbath\").\n\nSeven annual Biblical festivals, called by the name ''[[miqra]]'' (\"called assembly\") in Hebrew and \"[[High Sabbaths|High Sabbath]]\" in English, serve as supplemental testimonies to Sabbath. These are recorded in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] and do not necessarily occur on the Sabbath. They are observed by Jews and a minority of Christians. Three of them occur in spring: the first and seventh days of [[Passover (Christian holiday)|Passover]], and [[Pentecost]]. Four occur in fall, in the seventh month, and are also called ''Shabbaton'': the [[Christian observances of Jewish holidays#Feast of Trumpets|Feast of Trumpets]]; [[Christian observances of Yom Kippur|Yom Kippur]], \"Sabbath of Sabbaths\"; and the first and eighth days of [[Christian observances of Jewish holidays#Feast of Tabernacles|Tabernacles]].\n\nThe year of ''[[Shmita]]'' (Hebrew \u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4, literally, \"release\"), also called Sabbatical Year, is the seventh year of the seven-year agricultural cycle mandated by the [[Torah]] for the [[Land of Israel]]. During ''Shmita'', the land is to be left to lie fallow. A second aspect of ''Shmita'' concerns debts and loans: when the year ends, personal debts are considered nullified and forgiven.\n\nJewish ''[[Shabbat]]'' is a weekly day of rest cognate to Christian Sabbath, observed from sundown on Friday until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night; it is also observed by a minority of Christians. Customarily, ''Shabbat'' is ushered in by lighting [[candle]]s shortly before sunset, at [[halakha|halakhicallly]] calculated times that change from week to week and from place to place.\n\nThe [[new moon]], occurring every 29 or 30 days, is an important separately sanctioned occasion in Judaism and some other faiths. It is not widely regarded as Sabbath, but some [[Hebrew Roots]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal churches]], such as the native New Israelites of Peru and the [[Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church]], do keep the day of the new moon as Sabbath or rest day, from evening to evening. New-moon services can last all day.\n\nIn [[South Africa]], Christian [[Boer]]s have celebrated December 16, the [[Day of the Vow]] (now called the [[Day of Reconciliation]], as annual Sabbath (holy day of thanksgiving) since 1838, commemorating a famous Boer victory over the [[Zulu Kingdom]].\n\nMany early Christian writers from the 2nd century, such as [[Epistle of Barnabas|pseudo-Barnabas]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome]] followed [[rabbinic Judaism]] (the ''Mishna'') in interpreting Sabbath not as a literal day of rest, but as a [[Millennialism|thousand-year reign]] of Jesus Christ, which would follow six millennia of world history.<ref name=Bauckham/>\n\nSecular use of \"Sabbath\" for \"rest day\", while it usually refers to Sunday, is often stated in [[North America]] to refer to different purposes for the rest day than those of [[Christendom]]. In ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]'' (1961), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that contemporary [[Maryland]] [[blue law]]s (typically, Sunday rest laws) were intended to promote the secular values of \"health, safety, recreation, and general well-being\" through a common day of rest, and that this day coinciding with majority Christian Sabbath neither reduces its effectiveness for secular purposes nor prevents adherents of other religions from observing their own holy days.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gregorian calendar]]\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{refbegin}}\n; First-day\n*{{cite book|last=Dawn|first=Marva J.|authorlink=Marva Dawn|title=Keeping the Sabbath Wholly: Ceasing, Resting, Embracing, Feasting|location=[[Grand Rapids]]|year=1989}}\n*{{cite book|last=Dawn|first=Marva J.|authorlink=Marva Dawn|title=The Sense of the Call: A Sabbath Way of Life for Those Who Serve God, the Church, and the World|year=2006}}\n*{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|edition=2d|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1997|author=United States Catholic Conference, Inc.|chapter=You Shall Love the Lord Your God with All Your Heart, and with All Your Soul, and with All Your Mind, Article 3, The Third Commandment|at=2168\u20132195}}\n\n; Seventh-day\n*{{cite book|last=Bacchiocchi|first=Samuele|authorlink=Samuele Bacchiocchi|title=From Sabbath to Sunday|publisher=Pontifical Gregorian University Press; Biblical Perspectives|year=1977|url=http://www.biblicalperspectives.com/books/sabbath_to_sunday/}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bacchiocchi|first=Samuele|authorlink=Samuele Bacchiocchi|title=Divine Rest for Human Restlessness|publisher=Biblical Perspectives|date=June 1980|url=http://www.biblicalperspectives.com/books/rest_restlessness/|isbn=978-99946-1-024-2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bacchiocchi|first=Samuele|authorlink=Samuele Bacchiocchi|title=The Sabbath Under Crossfire: A Biblical Analysis Of Recent Sabbath/Sunday Developments|publisher=Biblical Perspectives|url=http://sdanet.org/atissue/sabbath/bacchiocchi.htm|year=1998}}\n*{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Desmond|authorlink=Desmond Ford|title=The Forgotten Day|year=1981}}\n*{{cite book|last=Strand|first=Kenneth A., ed.|title=The Sabbath in Scripture and History|date=July 1982|isbn=978-0-8280-0037-6|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|publisher=Review and Herald Publishing Association}}\n*{{cite book|last=Tonstad|first=Sigve K.|title=The Lost Meaning of the Seventh Day|date=November 2009|isbn=978-1-883925-65-9|location=[[Berrien Springs, Michigan]]|publisher=Andrews University Press|url=http://universitypress.andrews.edu/catalog.php?key=199}}\n\n; Non-Sabbatarian\n*{{cite book|title=Sabbatarianism Re-examined|authorlink=Robert Brinsmead|last=Brinsmead|first=Robert|publisher=Verdict Publishing 4:4|date=June 1981|url=http://www.exadventist.com/Home/Articles/sabbatarian/tabid/452/Default.aspx}}\n*{{cite book|last=Ratzlaff|first=Dale|authorlink=|first2=Don|last2=Muth|first3=Richard|last3=Tinker|first4=Richard|last4=Fredericks|title=Sabbath in Christ|year=2003|origyear=1990}}\n\n; Varying\n*{{cite book|title=From Sabbath to Lord's Day|editor1-first=Don A.|editor1-last=Carson|year=1982|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers/Zondervan|editor-link=Don Carson|isbn=978-1-57910-307-1}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cotton, John Paul.

The Tibetan Lamas had revolted against Qing rule, killing Chinese government officials, western Catholic Christian missionaries and native Christian converts, since the Tibetan Buddhist [[Gelug]] Yellow Hat sect was suspicious of the Christian missionary success.\n\nZhao Erfeng extended Chinese rule into [[Kham]], and was appointed [[Amban]] in 1908. Initially he worked with the 13th [[Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], who had returned after fleeing from the [[British expedition to Tibet|British invasion of 1903-1904]].<ref name=Thomson70>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_OPUTAAAAIAAJ|quote=chao ehr feng tibet drove dalai lama out india campaign.|title=China revolutionized |first=John Stuart |last=Thomson|authorlink=John Stuart Thomson |year=1913 |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill |location=Indianapolis |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_OPUTAAAAIAAJ/page/n89 70] |oclc=411755 |accessdate=2010-10-11 }}</ref> But in 1909, they disagreed with each other strongly and Zhao Erfeng drove the Dalai Lama into exile. The Dalai Lama was installed at the palace and monastery of [[Potala]] amid popular demonstrations.  The ruler, who was again given civil power at the head of their hierarchy, pardoned all the Tibetans who had given the oath to [[Francis Younghusband|Colonel Younghusband]]. Things went well for a month until the lama protested to the Chinese in charge of military affairs because of the excesses of the Chinese troops on the [[Sichuan]] frontier, where they were sacking the monasteries and killing the monks.  This protest served to stir up the whole question of the status of Tibet.  The Amban declared that it was a Chinese province, and said he would deal with the rebels as it pleased him to do.\n\nOther questions of authority arose, and finally the Amban sent orders to 500 Chinese troops who were encamped on the outskirts of the capital, [[Lhasa]]. \n{{quote|In 1910, China's 'foreign' Manchu Ch'ing dynasty, in a decaying spasm of aggression, had sent two thousand troops under General Chao Er-feng across the border into Tibet.

He retained in office the high officials then appointed, and pardoned all Tibetans who had assisted the mission. But in 1909 Chinese troops were sent to operate on the Sichuan frontier against certain insurgent lamas, whom they handled severely. When the Dalai Lama attempted to give orders that they should cease, the Chinese amban in Lhasa disputed his authority, and [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1910)|summoned the Chinese troops to enter the city]].

The Dalai Lama was installed at the palace and monastery of [[Potala]] amid popular demonstrations.  The ruler, who was again given civil power at the head of their hierarchy, pardoned all the Tibetans who had given the oath to [[Francis Younghusband|Colonel Younghusband]]. Things went well for a month until the lama protested to the Chinese in charge of military affairs because of the excesses of the Chinese troops on the [[Sichuan]] frontier, where they were sacking the monasteries and killing the monks.  This protest served to stir up the whole question of the status of Tibet.  The Amban declared that it was a Chinese province, and said he would deal with the rebels as it pleased him to do.\n\nOther questions of authority arose, and finally the Amban sent orders to 500 Chinese troops who were encamped on the outskirts of the capital, [[Lhasa]]. \n{{quote|In 1910, China's 'foreign' Manchu Ch'ing dynasty, in a decaying spasm of aggression, had sent two thousand troops under General Chao Er-feng across the border into Tibet.

He retained in office the high officials then appointed, and pardoned all Tibetans who had assisted the mission. But in 1909 Chinese troops were sent to operate on the Sichuan frontier against certain insurgent lamas, whom they handled severely. When the Dalai Lama attempted to give orders that they should cease, the Chinese amban in Lhasa disputed his authority, and [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1910)|summoned the Chinese troops to enter the city]].

For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.\n\nAirway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.\n\n===CPR===\nThe basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].\n\nIn this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.\n\nIn the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.\n\nPreviously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.  However, some trainers now use the C to mean Compressions in their basic first aid training.\n\n== Airway ==\n{{main article|airway management}}\n\n=== Unconscious patients ===\nIn the unconscious patient, the priority is [[airway management]], to avoid a preventable cause of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].

For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.\n\nAirway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.\n\n===CPR===\nThe basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].\n\nIn this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.\n\nIn the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.\n\nPreviously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.
