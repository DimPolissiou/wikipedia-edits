He appears sporadically in all seven seasons of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and is a main cast member of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. O'Brien was originally the [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] chief of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]]. He was later promoted to Chief of Operations of [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]]. O'Brien is the only major [[Star Trek]] character described as both ethnically [[Irish People|Irish]] and born in Ireland. O'Brien is portrayed by actor [[Colm Meaney]].\n\n==Casting==\nAccording to Colm Meaney, at first O'Brien \"was just there, not really established as a character, and that went on for a bit.\"<ref>\"Because there was not much for him to do, with the computer and all\", Hal Schuster, ''The Trekker's Guide to Deep Space Nine: Complete, Unauthorized and Uncensored''. Roseville, California: Prima Publishing (1997): 52</ref> He has a few lines in the pilot ''TNG'' episode, \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\". Appearing on and off in subsequent episodes, mainly operating the ship's transporters, it wasn't until the second season episode \"[[Unnatural Selection (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unnatural Selection]]\" that Meaney's character was named, and the second episode of season 4, \"[[Family (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Family]],\" before the character was given a first name, and his personal life began to be developed. However, Meaney came to like the arrangement of being hired on an episode-by-episode basis, and was hesitant to sign on as a regular on ''DS9''.<ref>Schuster (1997): 53</ref> Along with [[Worf]], Miles O'Brien is one of the two characters that moved from ''TNG'' to be a main character on ''DS9''.\n\n==Character postings==\n*USS Rutledge\n**Junior tactical Officer\n*Setlik III - Skirmish with Cardassian forces during the Cardassian/Federation war\n*USS Enterprise-D\n**Transporter chief\n**Operations and engineering\n*Deep Space Nine (Federation administered Bajoran station)\n**Chief of Operations\n**Chief Engineer USS Defiant (Support starship assigned to Deep Space Nine)\n*Starfleet Academy - San Francisco, California, Earth\n**Professor of Engineering\n\n==Character story==\n===Backstory===\nThe backstory of the character states that Miles O'Brien was born in [[Killarney]], a town in [[County Kerry]] in Ireland, [[Earth]], in September 2328.<ref>Okuda, Michael & Denise, ''Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future'' New York: Bantam Books (1996): Appendix B</ref> He claims descent from [[Brian Boru]], the famous ''Ard R\u00ed'', or [[High King of Ireland]] (and founder of the [[O'Brien Clan]]). His father, Michael O'Brien, wanted him to play the cello, so he pursued this and was eventually accepted into the ''Aldebaran Music Academy'' (revealed in ''DS9'' episode \"[[Shadowplay (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Shadowplay]]\"). However, a few days before he was scheduled to start classes there, he enlisted in [[Starfleet]]. O'Brien can also be seen playing the cello as part of Data's string quartet early in the TNG episode \"[[The Ensigns of Command]]\". In the ''DS9'' episode \"[[Invasive Procedures (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Invasive Procedures]]\", it is revealed he has two brothers.\n\nThe TNG episode \"[[The Wounded (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Wounded]]\" establishes that O'Brien served as tactical officer aboard the USS ''Rutledge'' during the Cardassian War and that he was emotionally scarred by the [[Cardassian]]s' massacre of hundreds of civilians on Setlik III. O'Brien does not remember how many Cardassians he killed, because he killed so many (''Star Trek DS9'': \"The Inquisition\"). In that episode, it is clear that the classic Irish tune ''\"[[The Minstrel Boy]]\"'' plays a major part of his journey as a character: an innocent man thrown into the destructive nature of war. He sings the song in this episode, and much later, in the final episode of ''DS9'' \"[[What You Leave Behind]]\". ''\"The Minstrel Boy\"'' is the first musical theme to be heard in the flashback sequence.\n\nIn the ''DS9'' episode \"[[Bar Association (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Bar Association]]\", O'Brien jokingly claims to be a direct descendant of real-life Irish High King [[Brian Boru]] (according to Irish tradition, all people with the surname \"[[O'Brien dynasty|O'Brien]]\" are Boru's descendants). Later, he speaks more seriously of fictional ancestor Sean Aloysius O'Brien, a major player in one of the first United States workers' unions, who participated in the [[Coal Strike of 1902]] in [[Pennsylvania]] and was shot, then dumped into the [[Allegheny River]]. In the episode \"[[Rules of Engagement (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rules of Engagement]]\", it is revealed that during O'Brien's 22 years in Starfleet, he had fought in 235 separate battles and had been decorated by Starfleet on 15 occasions, and was considered to be an expert in starship combat.\n\n===Depiction in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''===\nO'Brien's first appearance in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' as the battle bridge flight controller in ''The Next Generation'' premiere episode \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\", with his only other appearance in the first season being as a security guard in the episode \"[[Lonely Among Us]]\". Starting with the second season premiere, \"[[The Child (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Child]]\", O'Brien began his regular role as the ship's transporter operator, a position which had usually been filled by the since-departed [[Tasha Yar]] in the first season. In the following episode, \"[[Where Silence Has Lease]]\", when Riker and Worf prepare to beam to the USS ''Yamato'', Riker refers to him as a lieutenant and the character is wearing lieutenant collar pips. He still wears lieutenant pips in \"[[Sarek (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Sarek]]\", but in later episodes, the collar symbol has changed and O'Brien is referred to simply as Chief. (See \"Rank\" below).\n\nIn 2367, he confronted Capt. Benjamin Maxwell, his former commanding officer on the USS ''Rutledge'', when Maxwell attacked Cardassian ships and outposts without authorisation and threatened the peace between the Federation and the Cardassian Union (TNG: \"The Wounded\").\n\nDuring the Klingon Civil War, O'Brien is assigned to the bridge as tactical officer due to Worf's resignation from Starfleet and the temporary reassignment of officers to other ships in a fleet led by Capt. Picard (TNG: \"Redemption Part II\").\n\nO'Brien marries [[Keiko O'Brien|Keiko Ishikawa]] aboard the USS ''Enterprise''-D in the ''TNG'' episode \"[[Data's Day]]\".

Indeed, Miles has as much as, if not more, command experience than those officers he works with. For instance, during a formal extradition hearing regarding Lt. Commander Worf, O'Brien is declared an expert in starship combat owing to his experiences and is asked to critique Worf's actions. Also, Miles offered Worf some guidance about commanding and managing others during a crisis. Miles' style of command can be classified as generally hands-on with an emphasis on \"thinking on your feet\" when solving problems. However, Miles is not above asserting his authority when required. All that said, Miles uses a straightforward and common-sense approach toward the issues he faces.\n\n===Mirror Universe===\nMiles O'Brien of the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Mirror Universe]] was a Terran slave who worked for the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance aboard station Terok Nor. In 2370, O'Brien was working in the station's ore processing center. O'Brien was also occasionally recruited to repair Benjamin Sisko's raider when it was docked at the station. Sisko claimed he hated the name Miles, and instead nicknamed O'Brien \"Smiley\". Miles was known on the station for being an excellent \"tinkerer and putterer\".\n\nWhen Smiley met a Julian Bashir from another universe in the ore processing center, he initially thought that Bashir's \"wild\" tales of his counterpart being Chief of Operations was simply a ruse to get him to help Bashir. However, Bashir was able to persuade him to help after he realised that anything had to be better than being a slave. Smiley agreed to help Bashir try to escape from the station only if he could go back with him to the other universe. When Captain Sisko defied Intendant Kira Nerys who commanded the station, Smiley changed his mind and decided to join Sisko's crew, deciding that there was something worth staying for after all (Episode: \"[[Crossover (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Crossover]]\").\n\nWhen Mirror Sisko was killed by the Alliance in early 2371, Smiley took charge of the Terran Rebellion. To complete Sisko's last mission, he recruited Benjamin Sisko to take the place of his deceased counterpart long enough to convince Jennifer Sisko to leave the Alliance and start working for the Rebellion (Episode: \"[[Through the Looking Glass (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Through the Looking Glass]]\").\n\nWhile he was aboard Deep Space 9, Smiley took the opportunity to download a large portion of the station's database, including the schematics for the USS Defiant. Smiley used the stolen specifications to build a warship, which they named Defiant. After the rebels managed to capture Terok Nor from the Alliance, the Alliance prepared to recapture the station. Smiley once again recruited Sisko to help them finish construction of the Defiant in time. After successfully defending the station, Smiley sent Sisko back home (Episode: \"[[Shattered Mirror (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Shattered Mirror]]\").\n\nIn 2375, Smiley was in command of the Defiant when it pursued Brunt's ship as it stole a cloaking device from the station, and later negotiated Regent Worf's surrender and capture (Episode: \"[[The Emperor's New Cloak]]\").\n\n===Rank===\nDuring the story progression of ''TNG'' and ''DS9'', O'Brien wears black silver-rimmed insignia, or lieutenant junior grade (''TNG'': \"Encounter at Farpoint\"), [[lieutenant (Star Trek)|lieutenant]] insignia (\"Redemption, Part II\", \"Data's Day\", etc.), and then black gold-rimmed insignia (''DS9'': \"Emissary\"). [[Sergey and Helena Rozhenko|Sergey Rozhenko]] calls him a Chief Petty Officer in \"[[Family (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Family]]\" (''TNG'') but he had been referred to in previous episodes as Lieutenant. Eventually, O'Brien receives a distinct [[Starfleet enlisted ranks and insignia|senior chief petty officer]]'s insignia and his rank is emphatically identified in \"[[Hippocratic Oath (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Hippocratic Oath]]\" (''DS9'').\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2009, [[IGN]] rated Miles the 17th best character of all  ''Star Trek'' up to that time.\n\nIn 2016, the Miles O'Brien was ranked as the 17th most important character of [[Starfleet]] within the ''Star Trek'' science fiction universe by [[Wired magazine]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/09/star-treks-100-crew-members-ranked/|title=Star Trek's 100 Most Important Crew Members, Ranked|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|date=2016-09-05|work=Wired|access-date=2019-03-20|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> In 2018, [[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] ranked Miles O'Brien the 15th best [[Starfleet]] character of ''Star Trek''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/star-trek-starfleet-members-ranked/|title=Star Trek: The 25 Best Members Of Starfleet, Ranked|date=2018-10-27|website=CBR|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> (Starfleet is a fictional organization within the Star Trek science fiction universe.)\n\nIn 2016, [[Screen Rant|ScreenRant]] rated Miles O'Brien as the 20th best character in ''Star Trek'' overall as presented in television and film up to that time, highlighting the character's role in episodes such as  \"[[Hard Time (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Hard Time]]\", \"[[Tribunal (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Tribunal]]\", \"[[The Wounded (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Wounded]]\", and \"[[Time's Orphan|Time\u2019s Orphan]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/best-star-trek-characters-ever/|title=The 20 Best Characters In Star Trek History|date=2016-11-19|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/08/top-25-star-trek-characters|title=Top 25 Star Trek Characters|last=Movies|first=I.

He appears sporadically in all seven seasons of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and is a main cast member of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. O'Brien was originally the [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] chief of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]]. He was later promoted to Chief of Operations of [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]]. O'Brien is the only major [[Star Trek]] character described as both ethnically [[Irish People|Irish]] and born in Ireland. O'Brien is portrayed by actor [[Colm Meaney]].\n\n==Casting==\nAccording to Colm Meaney, at first O'Brien \"was just there, not really established as a character, and that went on for a bit.\"<ref>\"Because there was not much for him to do, with the computer and all\", Hal Schuster, ''The Trekker's Guide to Deep Space Nine: Complete, Unauthorized and Uncensored''. Roseville, California: Prima Publishing (1997): 52</ref> He has a few lines in the pilot ''TNG'' episode, \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\". Appearing on and off in subsequent episodes, mainly operating the ship's transporters, it wasn't until the second season episode \"[[Unnatural Selection (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unnatural Selection]]\" that Meaney's character was named, and the second episode of season 4, \"[[Family (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Family]],\" before the character was given a first name, and his personal life began to be developed. However, Meaney came to like the arrangement of being hired on an episode-by-episode basis, and was hesitant to sign on as a regular on ''DS9''.<ref>Schuster (1997): 53</ref> Along with [[Worf]], Miles O'Brien is one of the two characters that moved from ''TNG'' to be a main character on ''DS9''.\n\n==Character postings==\n*USS Rutledge\n**Junior tactical Officer\n*Setlik III - Skirmish with Cardassian forces during the Cardassian/Federation war\n*USS Enterprise-D\n**Transporter chief\n**Operations and engineering\n*Deep Space Nine (Federation administered Bajoran station)\n**Chief of Operations\n**Chief Engineer USS Defiant (Support starship assigned to Deep Space Nine)\n*Starfleet Academy - San Francisco, California, Earth\n**Professor of Engineering\n\n==Character story==\n===Backstory===\nThe backstory of the character states that Miles O'Brien was born in [[Killarney]], a town in [[County Kerry]] in Ireland, [[Earth]], in September 2328.<ref>Okuda, Michael & Denise, ''Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future'' New York: Bantam Books (1996): Appendix B</ref> He claims descent from [[Brian Boru]], the famous ''Ard R\u00ed'', or [[High King of Ireland]] (and founder of the [[O'Brien Clan]]). His father, Michael O'Brien, wanted him to play the cello, so he pursued this and was eventually accepted into the ''Aldebaran Music Academy'' (revealed in ''DS9'' episode \"[[Shadowplay (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Shadowplay]]\"). However, a few days before he was scheduled to start classes there, he enlisted in [[Starfleet]]. O'Brien can also be seen playing the cello as part of Data's string quartet early in the TNG episode \"[[The Ensigns of Command]]\". In the ''DS9'' episode \"[[Invasive Procedures (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Invasive Procedures]]\", it is revealed he has two brothers.\n\nThe TNG episode \"[[The Wounded (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Wounded]]\" establishes that O'Brien served as tactical officer aboard the USS ''Rutledge'' during the Cardassian War and that he was emotionally scarred by the [[Cardassian]]s' massacre of hundreds of civilians on Setlik III. O'Brien does not remember how many Cardassians he killed, because he killed so many (''Star Trek DS9'': \"The Inquisition\"). In that episode, it is clear that the classic Irish tune ''\"[[The Minstrel Boy]]\"'' plays a major part of his journey as a character: an innocent man thrown into the destructive nature of war. He sings the song in this episode, and much later, in the final episode of ''DS9'' \"[[What You Leave Behind]]\". ''\"The Minstrel Boy\"'' is the first musical theme to be heard in the flashback sequence.\n\nIn the ''DS9'' episode \"[[Bar Association (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Bar Association]]\", O'Brien jokingly claims to be a direct descendant of real-life Irish High King [[Brian Boru]] (according to Irish tradition, all people with the surname \"[[O'Brien dynasty|O'Brien]]\" are Boru's descendants). Later, he speaks more seriously of fictional ancestor Sean Aloysius O'Brien, a major player in one of the first United States workers' unions, who participated in the [[Coal Strike of 1902]] in [[Pennsylvania]] and was shot, then dumped into the [[Allegheny River]]. In the episode \"[[Rules of Engagement (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rules of Engagement]]\", it is revealed that during O'Brien's 22 years in Starfleet, he had fought in 235 separate battles and had been decorated by Starfleet on 15 occasions, and was considered to be an expert in starship combat.\n\n===Depiction in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''===\nO'Brien's first appearance in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' as the battle bridge flight controller in ''The Next Generation'' premiere episode \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\", with his only other appearance in the first season being as a security guard in the episode \"[[Lonely Among Us]]\". Starting with the second season premiere, \"[[The Child (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Child]]\", O'Brien began his regular role as the ship's transporter operator, a position which had usually been filled by the since-departed [[Tasha Yar]] in the first season. In the following episode, \"[[Where Silence Has Lease]]\", when Riker and Worf prepare to beam to the USS ''Yamato'', Riker refers to him as a lieutenant and the character is wearing lieutenant collar pips. He still wears lieutenant pips in \"[[Sarek (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Sarek]]\", but in later episodes, the collar symbol has changed and O'Brien is referred to simply as Chief. (See \"Rank\" below).\n\nIn 2367, he confronted Capt. Benjamin Maxwell, his former commanding officer on the USS ''Rutledge'', when Maxwell attacked Cardassian ships and outposts without authorisation and threatened the peace between the Federation and the Cardassian Union (TNG: \"The Wounded\").\n\nDuring the Klingon Civil War, O'Brien is assigned to the bridge as tactical officer due to Worf's resignation from Starfleet and the temporary reassignment of officers to other ships in a fleet led by Capt. Picard (TNG: \"Redemption Part II\").\n\nO'Brien marries [[Keiko O'Brien|Keiko Ishikawa]] aboard the USS ''Enterprise''-D in the ''TNG'' episode \"[[Data's Day]]\". They have a daughter, [[Molly O'Brien|Molly]], who is delivered by Worf in \"[[Disaster (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Disaster]]\".\n\nO'Brien appears in over 50 episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*\"Encounter at Farpoint\" \n*\"Lonely Among Us\" \n*\"The Child\" \n*\"Where Silence Has Lease\" \n*\"Loud As A Whisper\" \n*\"Unnatural Selection\" \n*\"A Matter Of Honor\" \n*\"The Measure Of A Man\" \n*\"The Dauphin\" \n*\"Contagion\" \n*\"The Royale\" \n*\"Time Squared\" \n*\"The Icarus Factor\" \n*\"Pen Pals\" \n*\"Q Who\" \n*\"Up The Long Ladder\" \n*\"Manhunt\" \n*\"The Emissary\" \n*\"Shades of Gray\" \n*\"The Ensigns of Command\" \n*\"The Bonding\" \n*\"Booby Trap\" \n*\"The Enemy\" \n*\"The Hunted\" \n*\"A Matter of Perspective\" \n*\"Tin Man\" \n*\"Hollow Pursuits\" \n*\"The Most Toys\" \n*\"Sarek\" \n*\"Transfigurations\" \n*\"The Best of Both Worlds\" (Part I and Part II)\n*\"Family\" \n*\"Brothers\" \n*\"Remember Me\" \n*\"Legacy\" \n*\"Data's Day\" \n*\"The Wounded\" \n*\"Clues\" \n*\"Night Terrors\" \n*\"Half a Life\" \n*\"The Mind's Eye\" \n*\"In Theory\" \n*\"Redemption II\" \n*\"Darmok\" \n*\"Disaster\" \n*\"The Game\" \n*\"Power Play\" \n*\"Realm of Fear\" \n*\"Rascals\" \n*\"All Good Things...\"\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Depiction in ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine''===\n[[File:Alaimo, Shimerman and Meany.jpg|thumb|Colm Meaney ''(right)'' with ''Deep Space 9'' co-stars [[Marc Alaimo]] ''(left)'' and [[Armin Shimerman]] ''(center)'', who portrayed the characters of [[Dukat (Star Trek)|Gul Dukat]] and [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]], respectively.]]\nThe character of Miles O'Brien was transplanted from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|TNG]]'' to ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|DS9]]'' at the beginning of the latter show.

Smiley agreed to help Bashir try to escape from the station only if he could go back with him to the other universe. When Captain Sisko defied Intendant Kira Nerys who commanded the station, Smiley changed his mind and decided to join Sisko's crew, deciding that there was something worth staying for after all (Episode: \"[[Crossover (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Crossover]]\").\n\nWhen Mirror Sisko was killed by the Alliance in early 2371, Smiley took charge of the Terran Rebellion. To complete Sisko's last mission, he recruited Benjamin Sisko to take the place of his deceased counterpart long enough to convince Jennifer Sisko to leave the Alliance and start working for the Rebellion (Episode: \"[[Through the Looking Glass (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Through the Looking Glass]]\").\n\nWhile he was aboard Deep Space 9, Smiley took the opportunity to download a large portion of the station's database, including the schematics for the USS Defiant. Smiley used the stolen specifications to build a warship, which they named Defiant. After the rebels managed to capture Terok Nor from the Alliance, the Alliance prepared to recapture the station. Smiley once again recruited Sisko to help them finish construction of the Defiant in time. After successfully defending the station, Smiley sent Sisko back home (Episode: \"[[Shattered Mirror (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Shattered Mirror]]\").\n\nIn 2375, Smiley was in command of the Defiant when it pursued Brunt's ship as it stole a cloaking device from the station, and later negotiated Regent Worf's surrender and capture (Episode: \"[[The Emperor's New Cloak]]\").\n\n===Rank===\nDuring the story progression of ''TNG'' and ''DS9'', O'Brien wears black silver-rimmed insignia, or lieutenant junior grade (''TNG'': \"Encounter at Farpoint\"), [[lieutenant (Star Trek)|lieutenant]] insignia (\"Redemption, Part II\", \"Data's Day\", etc.), and then black gold-rimmed insignia (''DS9'': \"Emissary\"). [[Sergey and Helena Rozhenko|Sergey Rozhenko]] calls him a Chief Petty Officer in \"[[Family (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Family]]\" (''TNG'') but he had been referred to in previous episodes as Lieutenant.

In the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', he wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Yet there is one group of energy producers that are not being prosecuted for killing birds: wind-power companies. And wind-powered turbines are killing a vast number of birds every year. A July 2008 study of the wind farm at Altamont Pass California, estimated that its turbines kill an average of 80 golden eagles per year. The study, funded by the Alameda County Community Development Agency, also estimated that about 10,000 birds\u2014nearly all protected by the migratory bird act\u2014are being whacked every year at Altamont.</blockquote>\n\nHe also wrote about the health problems caused by low-frequency noise emitted from wind turbines.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal September 2009\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203706604574376543308399048|title=Windmills are killing our birds|last=Bryce|first=Robert|date=September 7, 2009|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=15 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2010, in an article for ''Slate'' he expressed dismay at the [[corn ethanol]] industry's attempts to use the blowout of the [[Macondo well]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as an basis to pursue more subsidies.<ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2256461/|title=The ethanol trap|last=Bryce|first=Robert|date=June 10, 2010|work=Slate|publisher=Slate|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nBryce is an advocate for increased [[shale gas]] consumption in the US.

When it comes to climate change, the key issues are no longer about forcings, albedo, or the ideal concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Instead, the key question is about policy, namely: if we are going to agree that carbon dioxide is bad, what are we supposed to do?

In the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', he wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Yet there is one group of energy producers that are not being prosecuted for killing birds: wind-power companies. And wind-powered turbines are killing a vast number of birds every year. A July 2008 study of the wind farm at Altamont Pass California, estimated that its turbines kill an average of 80 golden eagles per year. The study, funded by the Alameda County Community Development Agency, also estimated that about 10,000 birds\u2014nearly all protected by the migratory bird act\u2014are being whacked every year at Altamont.</blockquote>\n\nHe also wrote about the health problems caused by low-frequency noise emitted from wind turbines.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal September 2009\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203706604574376543308399048|title=Windmills are killing our birds|last=Bryce|first=Robert|date=September 7, 2009|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=15 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2010, in an article for ''Slate'' he expressed dismay at the [[corn ethanol]] industry's attempts to use the blowout of the [[Macondo well]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as an basis to pursue more subsidies.<ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2256461/|title=The ethanol trap|last=Bryce|first=Robert|date=June 10, 2010|work=Slate|publisher=Slate|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nBryce is an advocate for increased [[shale gas]] consumption in the US.

Just how significant, we don't know ... For me, in many ways, the science no longer matters because discussions about the science have become so vituperative and politicized.  Thus, my position about the science of global climate change is one of resolute agnosticism. When it comes to climate change, the key issues are no longer about forcings, albedo, or the ideal concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Instead, the key question is about policy, namely: if we are going to agree that carbon dioxide is bad, what are we supposed to do?
