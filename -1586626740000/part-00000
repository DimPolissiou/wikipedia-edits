These confederations were sometimes called \"''Drum Groups''\" after the Amenokal's symbol of authority, a drum. Clan (''Tewsit'') elders, called Imegharan (wisemen), were chosen to assist the chief of the confederation. Historically, there have been seven major confederations. <ref>https://www.temehu.com/tuareg-confederacies.htm</ref>\n\n* ''[[Kel Ajjer]]'' or Azjar: centre is the oasis of [[Ghat, Libya|Aghat]] (Ghat).\n* ''[[Kel Ahaggar]]'', in [[Ahaggar]] mountains.\n* ''[[Kel Adagh]]'', or ''Kel Assuk'': [[Kidal]], and [[Timbuktu|Tin Buktu]]\n* ''[[Aulliminden|Iwillimmidan]] [[Kel Ataram]]'', or ''Western Iwillimmidan'': [[M\u00e9naka]], and [[Azawagh]] region ([[Mali]])\n* ''[[Aulliminden|Iwillimmidan]] [[Kel Denneg]]'', or ''Eastern Iwillimmidan'': [[Tchin-Tabaraden]], Abalagh, Teliya [[Azawagh]] ([[Niger]]).\n* ''[[Kel Ayr]]'': [[Assod\u00e9]], [[Agadez]], [[In-Gall|In Gal]], [[Timia]] and Ifrwan.\n* ''[[Kel Gres]]'': [[Zinder]] and Tanut ([[Tanout]]) and south into northern Nigeria.\n* ''[[Kel Owey]]'': [[A\u00efr Massif]], seasonally south to [[Tessaoua]] (Niger)\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Tuareg resisted the [[Second French colonial empire|French colonial invasion]] of their Central Saharan homelands and annihilated a French expedition led by [[Paul Flatters]] in 1881.

In southern Morocco and [[Algeria]], the French met some of the strongest resistance from the [[Ahaggar]] Tuareg. Their ''[[Amenokal]]'', traditional chief [[Moussa ag Amastan]], fought numerous battles in defence of the region. Finally, Tuareg territories were taken under French governance.\n\nFrench colonial administration of the Tuareg was largely based on supporting the existing social hierarchy. The French came to the conclusion that Tuareg rebellions were largely the result of the implementation of policies that undermined the authority of traditional chiefs. The French wished to create a protectorate operating, ideally, through single chieftains. It was proposed that French support for the chieftains  would result in them becoming loyal adherents of the colonial authority, and the authority would interact with the Tuareg only through the chieftains. One of the consequences of this policy was that the French authorities did little or nothing to improve the status of the servile portion of Tuareg society, believing that the noble caste, on whom their policy relied,  would not survive without slaves.<ref>Hall, B.S.

Competition for resources in the [[Sahel]] has since led to conflicts between the Tuareg and neighboring African groups, especially after political disruption following French colonization and independence. There have been tight restrictions placed on [[nomad]]ization because of high [[population growth]]. [[Desertification]] is exacerbated by human activity i.e.; exploitation of resources and the increased firewood needs of growing cities. Some Tuareg are therefore experimenting with farming; some have been forced to abandon herding and seek jobs in towns and cities.<ref name=peace>\"Does Supply-Induced Scarcity Drive Violent Conflicts in the African Sahel?

At this time, in the aftermath of a clash between government soldiers and Tuareg outside a prison in [[Tchin-Tabaraden]], Niger, Tuareg in both Mali and Niger claimed autonomy for their traditional homeland: ([[T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9]], capital [[Agadez]], in Niger and the [[Azawad]] and [[Kidal]] regions of Mali). Deadly clashes between Tuareg fighters (with leaders such as [[Mano Dayak]]) and the military of both countries followed, with deaths numbering well into the thousands. Negotiations initiated by France and [[Algeria]] led to peace agreements (11 January 1992 in Mali and 1995 in Niger). Both agreements called for decentralization of national power and guaranteed the integration of Tuareg resistance fighters into the countries' respective national armies.<ref>\"A Political Analysis of Decentralisation: Coopting the Tuareg Threat in Mali\" (Sep. 2001) ''The Journal of Modern African Studies'' Vol. 39, No. 3</ref>\n\nMajor fighting between the Tuareg resistance and government security forces ended after the 1995 and 1996 agreements.

The position of ''amghar'' is hereditary through a matrilineal principle, it is usual for the son of a sister of the incumbent chieftain to succeed to his position.

The linguist [[Karl-Gottfried Prasse]] (1995) indicates that the nobles constitute the highest caste.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16-17}} They are known in the Tuareg language as ''im\u00fa\u0161a\u0263'' (approximately pronounced 'imohar' - also known as ''Imajaghan'', \"the proud and free\").<ref name=\"Gates2010p499\"/> The nobles originally had a monopoly on carrying arms and owning camels, and were the warriors of the Tuareg regions.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=16}} They may have achieved their social status by subjugating other Tuareg castes, keeping arms to defend their properties and vassals. They have also collected tribute from their vassals. This warrior nobility has traditionally married within their caste, not to individuals in strata below their own.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=16}} A collection of tribes, each led by a noble, forms a confederation called ''amanokal'', whose chieftain is elected from among the nobles by the tribal chiefs.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16-17}}<ref name=\"Heath2005p7\"/> The chieftain is the overlord during times of war, and receives tribute and taxes from tribes as a sign of their submission to his authority.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=20}}\n\nThe vassal-herdsmen are the second free strata within Tuareg society, occupying a position just below that of the nobles.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=17}} They are known as ''\u00edm\u0263ad'' (''Imghad'', singular ''Amghid'') in the Tuareg language.<ref name=\"Heath2005p7\"/> Although the vassals were also free, they did not own camels but instead kept donkeys and herds of goats, sheep and oxen. They pastured and tended their own herds as well those owned by the nobles of the confederation.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=17}} The vassal strata have traditionally paid an annual ''tiwse'', or tribute to the nobles as a part of their status obligations, and also hosted any noble who was traveling through their territory.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} In the late Medieval era, states Prasse, the previously existing weapon monopoly of the nobility broke down after regional wars took a heavy toll on the noble warrior strata, and thereafter the vassals carried weapons as well and were recruited as warriors.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} After the start of the French colonial rule, which deprived the nobles of their powers over war and taxation, the Tuaregs belonging to the noble strata disdained tending cattle and tilling the land, seeking instead soldiering or intellectual work.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}}\n\nA semi-noble strata of the Tuareg people has been the endogamous religious clerics, the ''[[marabout]]s'' (Tuareg: ''Ineslemen'', a loan word that means Muslim in Arabic).{{Sfn|Karl G.

Prasse|1995|p=18}}\n\nAccording to Rasmussen, the Tuareg castes are not only hierarchical, as each caste differs in mutual perception, food and eating behaviors. For example, she relates an explanation by a smith on why there is [[endogamy]] among Tuareg castes in Niger. The smith explained, \"nobles are like rice, smiths are like millet, slaves are like corn\".<ref>Susan Rasmussen (1996), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3630236 Matters of Taste: Food, Eating, and Reflections on \"The Body Politic\" in Tuareg Society], Journal of Anthropological Research, University of Chicago Press, Volume 52, Number 1 (Spring, 1996), page 61, Quote: \"'Nobles are like rice, smiths are like millet, and slaves are like corn', said Hado, a smith from the Kel Ewey conferdation of Tuareg near Moun Bagzan in northeastern Niger.

Prasse|1995|pp=19-20}} Traditionally, these local peasants were subservient to the warrior nobles who owned the oasis and the land. The peasants tilled these fields, whose output they gave to the nobles after keeping a fifth part of the produce.{{Sfn|Karl G.

One theory postulates that they are descendants of ancient people who lived in the Sahara before they were dominated by invading groups. Some speak a Songhay dialect along with Tuareg and Arabic.

During the 9th and 10th centuries, Berbers and Arabs built upon these pre-existing trade routes and quickly developed trans-Saharan and sub-Saharan transport networks. The successive local Muslim kingdoms developed increasing sophistication as states, their martial capacity, slave raiding, holding and trading systems. Among these Islamic states were the [[Ghana Empire]] (11th century), the [[Mali Empire]] (13th and 14th centuries), and the [[Songhay Empire]] (16th century).<ref name=\"DeCorse2001p17\"/> Slavery created a template for servile relationships, which developed into more complex castes and social stratification.<ref name=\"DeCorse2001p19\">{{cite book|author=Susan McIntosh|editor=Christopher R.

Other distinctive aspects of Tuareg culture include clothing, food, language, religion, arts, astronomy, nomadic architecture, traditional weapons, music, films, games, and economic activities.\n\n===Clothing=== <!-- a redirect target for links from other articles -->\nIn Tuareg society women do not traditionally wear the [[veil]], whereas men do.<ref name=Haven07/><ref name=Review66/> The most famous Tuareg symbol is the ''[[tagelmust]]'' (also called \u00e9gh\u00e9wed and, in Arabic, ''[[litham]]''), sometimes referred to as a cheche (pronounced \"shesh\"), a combined turban and veil, often indigo-blue colored. The men's facial covering originates from the belief that such action wards off evil spirits. It may have related instrumentally from the need for protection from the harsh desert sands as well. It is a firmly established tradition, as is the wearing of [[amulet]]s containing sacred objects and, recently, verses from the ''[[Qur'an]]''. Taking on the veil is associated with the rite of passage to manhood; men begin wearing a veil when they reach maturity. The veil usually conceals their face, excluding their eyes and the top of the nose.\n[[File:Tuareg woman from Mali January 2007.jpg|thumb|Tuareg woman in traditional garb]]\n[[File:Tuareg woman from Mali, 2007.jpg|thumb|Tuareg woman with face veil]]\n* '''[[tagelmust]]''': turban \u2013 men\n* '''[[bukar]]''': black cotton turban \u2013 men\n* '''[[tasuwart]]''': women's veil\n* '''[[takatkat]]''': shirt \u2013 women and men\n* '''[[takarbast]]''': short shirt \u2013 women and men\n* '''[[akarbey]]''': pants worn by men\n* '''[[afetek]]''': loose shirt worn by women\n* '''afer''': women's [[pagne]]\n* '''tari''': large black pagne for winter season\n* '''[[Burnous|bernuz]]''': long woolen cloth for winter\n* '''[[akhebay]]''': loose bright green or blue cloth for women\n* '''[[ighateman]]''': shoes\n* '''[[iragazan]]''': red leather sandals\n* '''[[ibuzagan]]''': leather shoes\nThe Tuareg are sometimes called the \"Blue People\" because the [[indigo]] pigment in the cloth of their traditional robes and turbans stained their skin dark blue.<ref name=\"GearonEamonn\" /> The traditional indigo turban is still preferred for celebrations, and generally Tuareg wear clothing and turbans in a variety of colors.\n\n===Food===\n[[Taguella]] is a flatbread made from wheat flour and cooked on a [[charcoal]] fire; the flat disk-shaped bread is buried under the hot sand. The bread is broken into small pieces and eaten with a meat sauce. [[Millet]] [[porridge]] called '''a cink''' or '''a liwa''' is a staple much like [[ugali]] and [[fufu]]. Millet is boiled with water to make a pap and eaten with milk or a heavy sauce. Common [[dairy]] foods are goat's and [[Camel milk|camel's milk]] called '''akh''', as well as cheese '''ta komart''' and '''Tona''' a thick [[yogurt]] made from them. [[Eghajira]] is a beverage drunk with a [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]]. It is made by pounding millet, [[goat cheese]], [[date (fruit)|dates]], milk and sugar and is served on festivals.\n\nA popular tea called \"atai\" or \"ashahi\" is made from Gunpowder Green Tea mixed with sugar. After steeping, it is poured three times in and out of the teapot over the tea, mint and sugar and served by pouring from a height of over a foot into small tea glasses with a froth on top.\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Tuareg languages}}\nThe Tuareg natively speak the [[Tuareg languages]].

The ''Inadan'' community makes traditional handicrafts. Among their products are [[tanaghilt]] or [[zakkat]] (the '[[Agadez Cross]]' or 'Croix d'Agadez'); the Tuareg sword ([[Takoba]]), many gold and silver-made necklaces called 'Takaza'; and earrings called 'Tizabaten'. Pilgrimage boxes have intricate iron and brass decorations, and are used for carrying items.\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{no ref| section|date=March 2020}}\nThe clear desert skies allowed the Tuareg to be keen observers.

There are several documented styles, some covered with animal skin, some with mats. The style tends to vary by location or subgroup.<ref>Prussin, Labelle \"African Nomadic Architecture\" 1995.</ref> The tent is traditionally constructed for the first time during the marriage ceremony and is considered an extension of the union, to the extent that the phrase \"making a tent\" is a metaphor for becoming married.<ref name=\"academia.edu\">{{cite journal |last1=Scelta |first1=Gabe |year=2011 |title=Much to Learn About Living: Tuareg Architecture and Reflections of Knowledge |url=https://www.academia.edu/7963101 |journal= |volume= |issue= |page=}}</ref> Because the tent is considered to be under the ownership of a married woman, sedentary dwellings generally belong to men, reflecting a patriarchal shift in power dynamics.

It was curated by Tom Seligman, director of the center. He had first spent time with the Tuareg in 1971 when he traveled through the Sahara after serving in the [[Peace Corps]]. The exhibition included crafted and adorned functional objects such as camel saddles, tents, bags, swords, amulets, cushions, dresses, earrings, spoons and drums.<ref>[http://museum.stanford.edu/news_room/Tuareg.html \"First Exhibition of Tuareg Art and Culture in America Appears at Stanford Before Traveling to the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629051459/http://museum.stanford.edu/news_room/Tuareg.html |date=29 June 2007 }}, Cantor Arts Center</ref> The exhibition also was shown at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] Fowler Museum in Los Angeles and the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of African Art]] in Washington, D.C.\n\nThroughout history, the Tuareg were renowned and respected warriors. Their decline as a military might came with the introduction of firearms, weapons which the Tuareg did not possess. The Tuareg warrior equipment consisted of a ''[[takoba]]'' (sword), ''[[allagh]]'' (lance) and ''aghar'' (shield) made of antelope hide.\n\n===Music===\n{{further|Berber music}}\nTraditional Tuareg music has two major components: the monochord violin ''[[anzad]]'' played often during night parties and a small ''[[tanbur|tambour]]'' covered with goatskin called ''[[tende]]'', performed during camel and horse races, and other festivities. Traditional songs called ''[[Asak (Tuareg)|Asak]]'' and ''[[Tisiway]]'' (poems) are sung by women and men during feasts and social occasions. Another popular Tuareg musical genre is ''[[takamba]]'', characteristic for its Afro percussions.\n\n'''Vocal music'''\n* '''tisiway''': poems\n* '''tasikisikit''': songs performed by women, accompanied by tende (drum); the men, on camel-back, circle the women as they sing.\n* '''asak''': songs accompanied by anzad monocord violin.\n* '''tahengemmit''': slow songs sung by elder men\n[[File:Tinariwen.jpg|thumb|[[Tinariwen]] (Tuareg band) from [[Mali]], taken at the [[Nice Jazz Festival]] in France]]\nChildren and youth music\n[[File:Othmane Bali-Algiers.jpg|thumb|Tuareg singer Athmane Bali from [[Djanet|Djanet, Algeria]]]]\n* '''Bellulla''' songs made by children playing with the lips\n* '''Fadangama''' small monocord instrument for children\n* '''Odili''' flute made from trunk of sorghum\n* '''Gidga''' small wooden instrument with irons sticks to make strident sounds\n\n'''Dance'''\n* tagest: dance made while seated, moving the head, the hands and the shoulders.\n* ewegh: strong dance performed by men, in couples and groups.\n* agabas: dance for modern ishumar guitars: women and men in groups.\n\nIn the 1980s rebel fighters founded [[Tinariwen]], a Tuareg band that fuses electric guitars and indigenous musical styles. Tinariwen is one of the best known and authentic Tuareg bands. Especially in areas that were cut off during the [[Tuareg rebellion (1990\u20131995)|Tuareg rebellion]] (e.g., Adrar des Iforas), they were practically the only music available, which made them locally famous and their songs/lyrics (e.g. Abaraybone, ...) are well known by the locals. They released their first CD in 2000, and toured in Europe and the United States in 2004. Tuareg guitar groups that followed in their path include [[Group Inerane]] and [[Group Bombino]]. The Niger-based band ''[[Etran Finatawa]]'' combines Tuareg and ''[[Wodaabe]]'' members, playing a combination of traditional instruments and electric guitars.\n\nMany music groups emerged after the 1980s cultural revival. Among the Tartit, Imaran and known artists are: Abdallah Oumbadougou from Ayr, Baly Othmany of Djanet.\n\n====Music genres, groups and artists====\n'''Traditional music'''\n* '''Majila Ag Khamed Ahmad''', singer Asak (vocal music), of Aduk, Niger\n* '''Almuntaha''' female Anzad (Tuareg violin) player, of Aduk, Niger\n* '''Ajju''' female Anzad (Tuareg violin) player, of Agadez, Niger\n* '''Islaman''' singer, genre Asak (vocal music), of Abalagh, Niger\n* '''Tambatan''' singer, genre Asak (vocal music), Tchin-Tabaraden, Niger\n* '''Alghadawiat''' female Anzad (Tuareg violin) player, of Akoubounou, Niger\n* '''Taghdu''' female Anzad (Tuareg violin) player, of Aduk, Niger\n\n'''Ishumar music''' or '''Teshumara''' music style\n* '''In Tayaden''' singer and guitar player, Adagh\n* '''Abareybon''' singer and guitar player, Tinariwen group, Adagh\n* '''Kiddu Ag Hossad''' singer and guitar player, Adagh\n* '''Baly Othmani''' singer, luth player, Djanet, Azjar\n* '''Abdalla Ag Umbadugu''', singer, Takrist N'Akal group, Ayr\n* '''Hasso Ag Akotey''', singer, Ayr\n\n'''[[World Music]]''' \n* '''[[Tinariwen]]''' [[Grammy Award]]-winning group, exemplar of the [[tishoumaren]] genre\n* '''[[Imarhan]]'''\n\n====Music and culture festivals====\n[[File:Sebiba Touareg Exhibition, Djanet (Alg\u00e9rie).jpg|thumb|250px|''Sebiba''{{refn|group=nb|The 3000 year old ''Sebiba'' festival is celebrated each year in [[Djanet]] (Algeria) where inhabitants of [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] and Tuaregs from neighbouring countries meet to simulate through songs and dance the fights that once separated them.<ref name=\"Abada 2016\">{{cite web|last=Abada|first=Latifa|title=La f\u00eate Touareg \"Sebiba\" c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9e en octobre \u00e0 Djanet|website=Al Huffington Post|date=10 Sep 2016|url=http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2016/09/10/-fete-touaregue-sebiba_n_11947408.html|language=fr}}</ref>}} Tuareg festival in [[Djanet]], Algeria.

The central government in [[Niamey]] has shown itself unwilling to cede control of the highly profitable mining to indigenous clans.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The Tuareg are determined not to relinquish the prospect of substantial economic benefit. The French government has independently tried to defend a French firm, Areva, established in Niger for fifty years and now mining the massive Imouraren deposit.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAdditional complaints against Areva are that it is: \"...plundering...the natural resources and [draining] the fossil deposits.

(2011) {{ISBN|9780745647852}}</ref> These mines yield uranium ores, which are then processed to produce ''[[yellowcake]]'', crucial to the nuclear power industry (as well as aspirational nuclear powers). In 2007, some Tuareg people in Niger allied themselves with the [[Niger Movement for Justice]] (MNJ), a rebel group operating in the north of the country. During 2004\u20132007, U.S. Special Forces teams trained Tuareg units of the [[Nigerien Army]] in the Sahel region as part of the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership. Some of these trainees are reported to have fought in [[Second Tuareg Rebellion|the 2007 rebellion]] within the MNJ. The goal of these Tuareg appears to be economic and political control of ancestral lands, rather than operating from religious and political ideologies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nDespite the Sahara's erratic and unpredictable rainfall patterns, the Tuareg have managed to survive in the hostile desert environment for centuries. Over recent years however, depletion of water by the uranium exploitation process combined with the effects of climate change are threatening their ability to subsist. Uranium mining has diminished and degraded Tuareg grazing lands. Not only does the mining industry produce radioactive waste that can contaminate crucial sources of ground water resulting in cancer, stillbirths, and genetic defects but it also uses up huge quantities of water in a region where water is already scarce. This is exacerbated by the increased rate of desertification thought to be the result of global warming. Lack of water forces the Tuareg to compete with southern farming communities for scarce resources and this has led to tensions and clashes between these communities. The precise levels of environmental and social impact of the mining industry have proved difficult to monitor due to governmental obstruction.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{In popular culture|date=July 2017}}\n* The Tuareg are the antagonists of the [[French Foreign Legion]] in [[P. C. Wren]]'s 1924 adventure novel ''[[Beau Geste]]'' and the films that were based on it.\n*The Tuareg are allies of the European-American protagonists in the 1930 boys' novel ''Desert Wings'' by Covington Clarke (pen name of [[Homer Clarke Venable]]).\n* Spanish author [[Alberto V\u00e1zquez-Figueroa]]'s novel ''[[Tuareg (novel)|Tuareg]]'' (1980) was his most critically and commercially successful, and was adapted into a 1984 film starring [[Mark Harmon]], ''[[Tuareg \u2013 The Desert Warrior]]''.\n* The 2005 film ''[[Sahara (2005 film)|Sahara]]'' featured a fictionalised group of Tuareg as a faction in a civil war underway in Mali.\n* [[David W.

The Tuareg in the Gossi environs in Mali largely bear the H1 haplogroup (52%), with the M1 lineage (19%) and various Sub-Saharan [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2]] subclades (19%) next most common. Similarly, most of the Tuareg inhabiting Gorom-Gorom in Burkina Faso carry the H1 haplogroup (24%), followed by various L2 subclades (24%), the V lineage (21%), and haplogroup M1 (18%). The Tuareg in the vicinity of Tanout in Maradi Region and westward to villages of Loube and Djibale in Tahoua Region in Niger are different from the other Tuareg populations in that a majority carry Sub-Saharan mtDNA lineages.  In fact, the name for these mixed blood Tuareg-Haussa people is \"Djibalawaa\" named after the village of Djibale in Bouza Department, Tahoua Region of Niger.

These confederations were sometimes called \"''Drum Groups''\" after the Amenokal's symbol of authority, a drum. Clan (''Tewsit'') elders, called Imegharan (wisemen), were chosen to assist the chief of the confederation. Historically, there have been seven major confederations. <ref>https://www.temehu.com/tuareg-confederacies.htm</ref>\n\n* ''[[Kel Ajjer]]'' or Azjar: centre is the oasis of [[Ghat, Libya|Aghat]] (Ghat).\n* ''[[Kel Ahaggar]]'', in [[Ahaggar]] mountains.\n* ''[[Kel Adagh]]'', or ''Kel Assuk'': [[Kidal]], and [[Timbuktu|Tin Buktu]]\n* ''[[Aulliminden|Iwillimmidan]] [[Kel Ataram]]'', or ''Western Iwillimmidan'': [[M\u00e9naka]], and [[Azawagh]] region ([[Mali]])\n* ''[[Aulliminden|Iwillimmidan]] [[Kel Denneg]]'', or ''Eastern Iwillimmidan'': [[Tchin-Tabaraden]], Abalagh, Teliya [[Azawagh]] ([[Niger]]).\n* ''[[Kel Ayr]]'': [[Assod\u00e9]], [[Agadez]], [[In-Gall|In Gal]], [[Timia]] and Ifrwan.\n* ''[[Kel Gres]]'': [[Zinder]] and Tanut ([[Tanout]]) and south into northern Nigeria.\n* ''[[Kel Owey]]'': [[A\u00efr Massif]], seasonally south to [[Tessaoua]] (Niger)\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Tuareg resisted the [[Second French colonial empire|French colonial invasion]] of their Central Saharan homelands and annihilated a French expedition led by [[Paul Flatters]] in 1881.

In southern Morocco and [[Algeria]], the French met some of the strongest resistance from the [[Ahaggar]] Tuareg. Their ''[[Amenokal]]'', traditional chief [[Moussa ag Amastan]], fought numerous battles in defence of the region. Finally, Tuareg territories were taken under French governance.\n\nFrench colonial administration of the Tuareg was largely based on supporting the existing social hierarchy. The French came to the conclusion that Tuareg rebellions were largely the result of the implementation of policies that undermined the authority of traditional chiefs. The French wished to create a protectorate operating, ideally, through single chieftains. It was proposed that French support for the chieftains  would result in them becoming loyal adherents of the colonial authority, and the authority would interact with the Tuareg only through the chieftains. One of the consequences of this policy was that the French authorities did little or nothing to improve the status of the servile portion of Tuareg society, believing that the noble caste, on whom their policy relied,  would not survive without slaves.<ref>Hall, B.S.

Competition for resources in the [[Sahel]] has since led to conflicts between the Tuareg and neighboring African groups, especially after political disruption following French colonization and independence. There have been tight restrictions placed on [[nomad]]ization because of high [[population growth]]. [[Desertification]] is exacerbated by human activity i.e.; exploitation of resources and the increased firewood needs of growing cities. Some Tuareg are therefore experimenting with farming; some have been forced to abandon herding and seek jobs in towns and cities.<ref name=peace>\"Does Supply-Induced Scarcity Drive Violent Conflicts in the African Sahel?

Deadly clashes between Tuareg fighters (with leaders such as [[Mano Dayak]]) and the military of both countries followed, with deaths numbering well into the thousands. Negotiations initiated by France and [[Algeria]] led to peace agreements (11 January 1992 in Mali and 1995 in Niger).

The linguist [[Karl-Gottfried Prasse]] (1995) indicates that the nobles constitute the highest caste.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16-17}} They are known in the Tuareg language as ''im\u00fa\u0161a\u0263'' (approximately pronounced 'imohar' - also known as ''Imajaghan'', \"the proud and free\").<ref name=\"Gates2010p499\"/> The nobles originally had a monopoly on carrying arms and owning camels, and were the warriors of the Tuareg regions.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=16}} They may have achieved their social status by subjugating other Tuareg castes, keeping arms to defend their properties and vassals. They have also collected tribute from their vassals. This warrior nobility has traditionally married within their caste, not to individuals in strata below their own.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=16}} A collection of tribes, each led by a noble, forms a confederation called ''amanokal'', whose chieftain is elected from among the nobles by the tribal chiefs.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16-17}}<ref name=\"Heath2005p7\"/> The chieftain is the overlord during times of war, and receives tribute and taxes from tribes as a sign of their submission to his authority.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=20}}\n\nThe vassal-herdsmen are the second free strata within Tuareg society, occupying a position just below that of the nobles.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=17}} They are known as ''\u00edm\u0263ad'' (''Imghad'', singular ''Amghid'') in the Tuareg language.<ref name=\"Heath2005p7\"/> Although the vassals were also free, they did not own camels but instead kept donkeys and herds of goats, sheep and oxen. They pastured and tended their own herds as well those owned by the nobles of the confederation.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=17}} The vassal strata have traditionally paid an annual ''tiwse'', or tribute to the nobles as a part of their status obligations, and also hosted any noble who was traveling through their territory.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} In the late Medieval era, states Prasse, the previously existing weapon monopoly of the nobility broke down after regional wars took a heavy toll on the noble warrior strata, and thereafter the vassals carried weapons as well and were recruited as warriors.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} After the start of the French colonial rule, which deprived the nobles of their powers over war and taxation, the Tuaregs belonging to the noble strata disdained tending cattle and tilling the land, seeking instead soldiering or intellectual work.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}}\n\nA semi-noble strata of the Tuareg people has been the endogamous religious clerics, the ''[[marabout]]s'' (Tuareg: ''Ineslemen'', a loan word that means Muslim in Arabic).{{Sfn|Karl G.

Prasse|1995|p=18}}\n\nAccording to Rasmussen, the Tuareg castes are not only hierarchical, as each caste differs in mutual perception, food and eating behaviors. For example, she relates an explanation by a smith on why there is [[endogamy]] among Tuareg castes in Niger. The smith explained, \"nobles are like rice, smiths are like millet, slaves are like corn\".<ref>Susan Rasmussen (1996), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3630236 Matters of Taste: Food, Eating, and Reflections on \"The Body Politic\" in Tuareg Society], Journal of Anthropological Research, University of Chicago Press, Volume 52, Number 1 (Spring, 1996), page 61, Quote: \"'Nobles are like rice, smiths are like millet, and slaves are like corn', said Hado, a smith from the Kel Ewey conferdation of Tuareg near Moun Bagzan in northeastern Niger.

Prasse|1995|pp=19-20}} Traditionally, these local peasants were subservient to the warrior nobles who owned the oasis and the land. The peasants tilled these fields, whose output they gave to the nobles after keeping a fifth part of the produce.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=19-20}} Their Tuareg patrons were usually responsible for supplying agricultural tools, seed and clothing. The peasants' origins are also unclear. One theory postulates that they are descendants of ancient people who lived in the Sahara before they were dominated by invading groups. Some speak a Songhay dialect along with Tuareg and Arabic.

''\u00c9benher''), which alludes to slaves that only speak a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language.

The veil usually conceals their face, excluding their eyes and the top of the nose.\n[[File:Tuareg woman from Mali January 2007.jpg|thumb|Tuareg woman in traditional garb]]\n[[File:Tuareg woman from Mali, 2007.jpg|thumb|Tuareg woman with face veil]]\n* '''[[tagelmust]]''': turban \u2013 men\n* '''[[bukar]]''': black cotton turban \u2013 men\n* '''[[tasuwart]]''': women's veil\n* '''[[takatkat]]''': shirt \u2013 women and men\n* '''[[takarbast]]''': short shirt \u2013 women and men\n* '''[[akarbey]]''': pants worn by men\n* '''[[afetek]]''': loose shirt worn by women\n* '''afer''': women's [[pagne]]\n* '''tari''': large black pagne for winter season\n* '''[[Burnous|bernuz]]''': long woolen cloth for winter\n* '''[[akhebay]]''': loose bright green or blue cloth for women\n* '''[[ighateman]]''': shoes\n* '''[[iragazan]]''': red leather sandals\n* '''[[ibuzagan]]''': leather shoes\nThe Tuareg are sometimes called the \"Blue People\" because the [[indigo]] pigment in the cloth of their traditional robes and turbans stained their skin dark blue.<ref name=\"GearonEamonn\" /> The traditional indigo turban is still preferred for celebrations, and generally Tuareg wear clothing and turbans in a variety of colors.\n\n===Food===\n[[Taguella]] is a flatbread made from wheat flour and cooked on a [[charcoal]] fire; the flat disk-shaped bread is buried under the hot sand. The bread is broken into small pieces and eaten with a meat sauce. [[Millet]] [[porridge]] called '''a cink''' or '''a liwa''' is a staple much like [[ugali]] and [[fufu]]. Millet is boiled with water to make a pap and eaten with milk or a heavy sauce. Common [[dairy]] foods are goat's and [[Camel milk|camel's milk]] called '''akh''', as well as cheese '''ta komart''' and '''Tona''' a thick [[yogurt]] made from them. [[Eghajira]] is a beverage drunk with a [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]]. It is made by pounding millet, [[goat cheese]], [[date (fruit)|dates]], milk and sugar and is served on festivals.\n\nA popular tea called \"atai\" or \"ashahi\" is made from Gunpowder Green Tea mixed with sugar. After steeping, it is poured three times in and out of the teapot over the tea, mint and sugar and served by pouring from a height of over a foot into small tea glasses with a froth on top.\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Tuareg languages}}\nThe Tuareg natively speak the [[Tuareg languages]].

It was curated by Tom Seligman, director of the center. He had first spent time with the Tuareg in 1971 when he traveled through the Sahara after serving in the [[Peace Corps]]. The exhibition included crafted and adorned functional objects such as camel saddles, tents, bags, swords, amulets, cushions, dresses, earrings, spoons and drums.<ref>[http://museum.stanford.edu/news_room/Tuareg.html \"First Exhibition of Tuareg Art and Culture in America Appears at Stanford Before Traveling to the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629051459/http://museum.stanford.edu/news_room/Tuareg.html |date=29 June 2007 }}, Cantor Arts Center</ref> The exhibition also was shown at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] Fowler Museum in Los Angeles and the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of African Art]] in Washington, D.C.\n\nThroughout history, the Tuareg were renowned and respected warriors. Their decline as a military might came with the introduction of firearms, weapons which the Tuareg did not possess. The Tuareg warrior equipment consisted of a ''[[takoba]]'' (sword), ''[[allagh]]'' (lance) and ''aghar'' (shield) made of antelope hide.\n\n===Music===\n{{further|Berber music}}\nTraditional Tuareg music has two major components: the monochord violin ''[[anzad]]'' played often during night parties and a small ''[[tanbur|tambour]]'' covered with goatskin called ''[[tende]]'', performed during camel and horse races, and other festivities. Traditional songs called ''[[Asak (Tuareg)|Asak]]'' and ''[[Tisiway]]'' (poems) are sung by women and men during feasts and social occasions. Another popular Tuareg musical genre is ''[[takamba]]'', characteristic for its Afro percussions.\n\n'''Vocal music'''\n* '''tisiway''': poems\n* '''tasikisikit''': songs performed by women, accompanied by tende (drum); the men, on camel-back, circle the women as they sing.\n* '''asak''': songs accompanied by anzad monocord violin.\n* '''tahengemmit''': slow songs sung by elder men\n[[File:Tinariwen.jpg|thumb|[[Tinariwen]] (Tuareg band) from [[Mali]], taken at the [[Nice Jazz Festival]] in France]]\nChildren and youth music\n[[File:Othmane Bali-Algiers.jpg|thumb|Tuareg singer Athmane Bali from [[Djanet|Djanet, Algeria]]]]\n* '''Bellulla''' songs made by children playing with the lips\n* '''Fadangama''' small monocord instrument for children\n* '''Odili''' flute made from trunk of sorghum\n* '''Gidga''' small wooden instrument with irons sticks to make strident sounds\n\n'''Dance'''\n* tagest: dance made while seated, moving the head, the hands and the shoulders.\n* ewegh: strong dance performed by men, in couples and groups.\n* agabas: dance for modern ishumar guitars: women and men in groups.\n\nIn the 1980s rebel fighters founded [[Tinariwen]], a Tuareg band that fuses electric guitars and indigenous musical styles. Tinariwen is one of the best known and authentic Tuareg bands. Especially in areas that were cut off during the [[Tuareg rebellion (1990\u20131995)|Tuareg rebellion]] (e.g., Adrar des Iforas), they were practically the only music available, which made them locally famous and their songs/lyrics (e.g. Abaraybone, ...) are well known by the locals. They released their first CD in 2000, and toured in Europe and the United States in 2004. Tuareg guitar groups that followed in their path include [[Group Inerane]] and [[Group Bombino]]. The Niger-based band ''[[Etran Finatawa]]'' combines Tuareg and ''[[Wodaabe]]'' members, playing a combination of traditional instruments and electric guitars.\n\nMany music groups emerged after the 1980s cultural revival. Among the Tartit, Imaran and known artists are: Abdallah Oumbadougou from Ayr, Baly Othmany of Djanet.\n\n====Music genres, groups and artists====\n'''Traditional music'''\n* '''Majila Ag Khamed Ahmad''', singer Asak (vocal music), of Aduk, Niger\n* '''Almuntaha''' female Anzad (Tuareg violin) player, of Aduk, Niger\n* '''Ajju''' female Anzad (Tuareg violin) player, of Agadez, Niger\n* '''Islaman''' singer, genre Asak (vocal music), of Abalagh, Niger\n* '''Tambatan''' singer, genre Asak (vocal music), Tchin-Tabaraden, Niger\n* '''Alghadawiat''' female Anzad (Tuareg violin) player, of Akoubounou, Niger\n* '''Taghdu''' female Anzad (Tuareg violin) player, of Aduk, Niger\n\n'''Ishumar music''' or '''Teshumara''' music style\n* '''In Tayaden''' singer and guitar player, Adagh\n* '''Abareybon''' singer and guitar player, Tinariwen group, Adagh\n* '''Kiddu Ag Hossad''' singer and guitar player, Adagh\n* '''Baly Othmani''' singer, luth player, Djanet, Azjar\n* '''Abdalla Ag Umbadugu''', singer, Takrist N'Akal group, Ayr\n* '''Hasso Ag Akotey''', singer, Ayr\n\n'''[[World Music]]''' \n* '''[[Tinariwen]]''' [[Grammy Award]]-winning group, exemplar of the [[tishoumaren]] genre\n* '''[[Imarhan]]'''\n\n====Music and culture festivals====\n[[File:Sebiba Touareg Exhibition, Djanet (Alg\u00e9rie).jpg|thumb|250px|''Sebiba''{{refn|group=nb|The 3000 year old ''Sebiba'' festival is celebrated each year in [[Djanet]] (Algeria) where inhabitants of [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] and Tuaregs from neighbouring countries meet to simulate through songs and dance the fights that once separated them.<ref name=\"Abada 2016\">{{cite web|last=Abada|first=Latifa|title=La f\u00eate Touareg \"Sebiba\" c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9e en octobre \u00e0 Djanet|website=Al Huffington Post|date=10 Sep 2016|url=http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2016/09/10/-fete-touaregue-sebiba_n_11947408.html|language=fr}}</ref>}} Tuareg festival in [[Djanet]], Algeria.

In 2007, some Tuareg people in Niger allied themselves with the [[Niger Movement for Justice]] (MNJ), a rebel group operating in the north of the country. During 2004\u20132007, U.S. Special Forces teams trained Tuareg units of the [[Nigerien Army]] in the Sahel region as part of the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership. Some of these trainees are reported to have fought in [[Second Tuareg Rebellion|the 2007 rebellion]] within the MNJ. The goal of these Tuareg appears to be economic and political control of ancestral lands, rather than operating from religious and political ideologies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nDespite the Sahara's erratic and unpredictable rainfall patterns, the Tuareg have managed to survive in the hostile desert environment for centuries. Over recent years however, depletion of water by the uranium exploitation process combined with the effects of climate change are threatening their ability to subsist. Uranium mining has diminished and degraded Tuareg grazing lands. Not only does the mining industry produce radioactive waste that can contaminate crucial sources of ground water resulting in cancer, stillbirths, and genetic defects but it also uses up huge quantities of water in a region where water is already scarce. This is exacerbated by the increased rate of desertification thought to be the result of global warming. Lack of water forces the Tuareg to compete with southern farming communities for scarce resources and this has led to tensions and clashes between these communities. The precise levels of environmental and social impact of the mining industry have proved difficult to monitor due to governmental obstruction.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{In popular culture|date=July 2017}}\n* The Tuareg are the antagonists of the [[French Foreign Legion]] in [[P.

It reaches frequencies of up to 100 percent in some parts of the [[Maghreb]], and is dominated by its sub-clade E-M183.

(2010) observed greater matrilineal heterogeneity among the Tuareg inhabiting more southerly areas in the Sahel. The Tuareg in the Gossi environs in Mali largely bear the H1 haplogroup (52%), with the M1 lineage (19%) and various Sub-Saharan [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2]] subclades (19%) next most common. Similarly, most of the Tuareg inhabiting Gorom-Gorom in Burkina Faso carry the H1 haplogroup (24%), followed by various L2 subclades (24%), the V lineage (21%), and haplogroup M1 (18%). The Tuareg in the vicinity of Tanout in Maradi Region and westward to villages of Loube and Djibale in Tahoua Region in Niger are different from the other Tuareg populations in that a majority carry Sub-Saharan mtDNA lineages.  In fact, the name for these mixed blood Tuareg-Haussa people is \"Djibalawaa\" named after the village of Djibale in Bouza Department, Tahoua Region of Niger. This points to significant assimilation of local West African females into this community. The most common maternal haplogroups found among the Tanout Tuareg are various L2 subclades (39%), followed by [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3]] (26%), various [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1]] sublineages (13%), V (10%), H1 (3%), M1 (3%), [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U3a]] (3%), and [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0a1a]] (3%).<ref name=\"Pereira2010\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|author=Karl G.

He joined the military service in the Luftwaffe and was trained as a fighter pilot. Following flight training,{{refn|Flight training in the Luftwaffe progressed through the levels A1, A2 and B1, B2, referred to as A/B flight training. A training included theoretical and practical training in aerobatics, navigation, long-distance flights and dead-stick landings.

Flying with this wing, Radener claimed his first aerial victory on 13 March 1943 on the Western Front over a [[Royal Air Force]] fighter aircraft which was not confirmed. After he had temporarily led 6. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u20131945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (6th squadron) of JG&nbsp;26 in late 1943, he was officially appointed squadron leader of 7. ''Staffel'' (7th squadron) of JG&nbsp;26 in February 1944. In late January 1945, Radener was given command of II. ''Gruppe'' (2nd group) of JG&nbsp;26. In late February 1945, he transferred to [[Jagdgeschwader 300|''Jagdgeschwader'' 300]] (JG&nbsp;300\u2014300th Fighter Wing) where he commanded II. ''Gruppe'' of JG&nbsp;300. On 12 March, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] for his service with JG&nbsp;26. After World War II, he joined the [[German Air Force]] and was killed in a flying accident 8 January 1957.\n\n==Early life==\nRadener was born on 24 January 1921 at L\u00fcchtrigen, present-day part of [[H\u00f6xter]], at the time in the [[Province of Westphalia]], a [[Free State of Prussia]] in the [[Weimar Republic]].{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=183}}\n\n==World War II==\nWorld War II in Europe began on Friday 1 September 1939 when German forces invaded Poland.

The [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighter came from either the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) [[402 Squadron|No. 402]] or [[403 Helicopter Operational Training Squadron|No. 403 Squadron]] and claimed shot down east of [[\u00c9taples]].{{sfn|Caldwell|1998|p=36}} His first confirmed aerial victory came on 3 May.

A ''Herausschuss'' was a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from his [[combat box]] which normally was counted as an aerial victory.

However, in each but his last season, his best scores for the season were in or around the half-century mark, until the last season he played, 1926, in which professional non-cricketing commitments took over more of his time.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/4/4852/4852.html Frank Pinch] at Cricket Archive {{subscription required}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pinch, Frank}}\n[[Category:1891 births]]\n[[Category:1961 deaths]]\n[[Category:English cricketers]]\n[[Category:Glamorgan cricketers]]\n[[Category:People from Bodmin]]\n[[Category:Wales cricketers]]\n", "name_user": "Gazamp", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:AddedPortal:Cornwall", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Pinch"}

The new republics from the beginning abolished the formal system of racial classification and hierarchy, [[Casta|casta system]], the [[Inquisition]], and noble titles. Slavery was not abolished immediately but ended in all of the new nations within a quarter century. [[Criollo people|Criollos]] (those of Spanish descent born in the New World) and [[mestizo]]s (those of mixed American Indian and Spanish blood or culture) replaced [[Peninsulars|Spanish-born]] appointees in most political governments. Criollos remained at the top of a social structure that retained some of its traditional features culturally, if not legally. For almost a century thereafter, [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|conservatives and liberals]] fought to reverse or to deepen the social and political changes unleashed by those rebellions.\n\nThe events in Spanish America were related to the [[war of independence|wars of independence]] in the former French colony of St-Domingue, [[Haiti]], and the transition to independence in Brazil. [[Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]], in particular, shared a common starting point with that of Spanish America, since both conflicts were triggered by Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, which forced the Portuguese royal family [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|to flee to Brazil]] in 1807. The process of Latin American independence took place in the general political and intellectual climate that emerged from the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and that influenced all of the [[Atlantic Revolutions]], including the earlier revolutions in the [[American Revolution|United States]] and [[French Revolution|France]]. A more direct cause of the Spanish American wars of independence were the unique developments occurring within the [[History of Spain (1814\u201373)|Kingdom of Spain]] and its [[monarchy of Spain|monarchy]] during this era.\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:Hisparevol.gif|thumb|250px|<br />'''Development of Spanish American Independence'''<br />{{legend |#FF0000|Government under traditional Spanish law}}{{legend |#FFA500|Loyal to Supreme Central Junta or Cortes}}{{legend |#FFFF00|American junta or insurrection movement}}{{legend |#008000|Independent state declared or established}}{{legend |#000080|Height of French control of the Peninsula}}]]\n\nPolitical independence was not necessarily the foreordained outcome of the political turmoil in Spanish America. \"There was little interest in outright independence.\"<ref>[[David Bushnell]], \"Wars of Independence: South America\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 5, p. 446.

Moya, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2011, p. 154.</ref> when Spanish American independence did occur, explanations for why it came about have been sought. The Latin American Wars of Independence were essentially led by European diaspora against European empires.\n\nThere are a number of factors that have been identified. First, increasing control by the Crown of its overseas empire via the [[Bourbon Reforms]] of the mid-eighteenth century introduced changes to the relationship of Spanish Americans to the Crown. The language used to describe the overseas empire shifted from \"kingdoms\" with independent standing with the crown to \"colonies\" subordinate to Spain.<ref>Mark A. Burkholder,(2016) \"Spain's America: from kingdoms to colonies, ''Colonial Latin American Review'', 25:2, 125-153, DOI: 10.1080/10609164.2016.1205241</ref> In an effort to better control the administration and economy of the overseas possessions the Crown reintroduced the practice of appointing outsiders, almost all ''[[peninsulars]]'', to the royal offices throughout the empire. This meant that Spanish American elites were thwarted in their expectations and ambitions by the crown's upending of long-standing practices of creole access to office holding.<ref>Mark A. Burkholder and D.S. Chandler, ''From Impotence to Authority: The Spanish Crown and the American Audiencias, 1687-1808''. Columbia: University of Missouri Press 1977.</ref>\n\nThe regalist and secularizing policies of the Bourbon monarchy were aimed at decreasing the power of the Roman Catholic Church. The crown had already [[expulsion of the Jesuits|expelled the Jesuits]] in 1767, which saw many creole members of the Society of Jesus go into permanent exile. By limiting the power of the Church, the crown attempted to centralize itself within the institutions of colonial Latin America. Because of the physical and ideological proximity that the clergy had,<ref name=\":1\">Mills, Kenneth; Taylor, William B.; Lauderdale Graham, Sandra (2002).

Taylor; Lauderdale Graham, Sandra (2002). ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History''. Maryland: SR Books. p. 107.</ref> a directness which the crown would need to attempt to create the centralized, colonial state which it wanted to implement.\n\nLater in the eighteenth century the crown sought to decrease the privileges (''fueros'') of the clergy, restricting clerical authority to spiritual matters and undermining the power of parish priests, who often acted as agents of the crown in rural parishes.<ref>[[Nancy Farriss]], ''Crown and Clergy in Colonial Mexico, 1759-1821''. London: Athlone Press 1968.</ref>  By desacralizing power and frontal attacks on the clergy, the crown, according to [[William B. Taylor (historian)|William B. Taylor]], undermined its own legitimacy, since parish priests had been traditionally the \"natural local representatives of their Catholic king.\"<ref>William B. Taylor, \"Early Latin American Social History\" in ''Reliving the Past: The Worlds of Social History''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1985, p. 149.</ref>\n\nIn the economic sphere, the crown sought to gain control over church revenues. The Church functioned as one of the largest economic institutions within colonial Latin America. It owned and retained jurisdiction over large amounts of land,<ref name=\":1\" /> which the crown wanted for itself because of the economic value which could be derived from the land.<ref>Mills, Kenneth; Taylor, William B.; Lauderdale Graham, Sandra (2002). ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History''. Maryland: SP Books. p. 309-313.</ref> Moreover, by taking that land for itself, the Crown had the opportunity to cut down the physical presence of the Church to further weaken its ideological and social role within local colonial communities.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn a financial crisis of 1804, the crown attempted to call in debts owed the church, mainly in the form of mortgages for [[hacienda]]s owned by the elites. The Act of Consolidation simultaneously threatened the wealth of the church, whose capital was mainly lent for mortgages, as well as threatening the financial well-being of elites, who depended on mortgages for acquiring and keeping their estates.  Shortening the repayment period meant many elites were faced with bankruptcy.<ref>Margaret Chowning, \"The ''Consolidaci\u00f3n de Vales Reales'' in the Bishopric of Michoac\u00e1n.\" ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 69:3 (1989) 451-78.</ref> The crown also sought to gain access to benefices elite families set aside to support a priest, often their own family members, by eliminating these endowed funds (''capellan\u00edas'') that the lower clergy depended on disproportionately.<ref>Michael P.

In some areas\u2014such as [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|R\u00edo de la Plata]] and [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]\u2014the reforms had positive effects, improving the local economy and the efficiency of the government.<ref>Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions'', 17\u201319, 334\u2013335.

Kinsbruner,  ''Independence in Spanish America'', 7\u201312.</ref>   In other areas, the changes in the crown's economic and administrative policies led to tensions with locals, which at times erupted into open revolts, such as the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|Revolt of the Comuneros]] in [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] and the [[Rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II]] in [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]].\n\nThe loss of high offices to Peninsulars and the eighteenth-century revolts in Spanish South America were the some of the direct causes of the wars of independence, which took place decades later, but they have been considered important elements of the political background in which the wars took place.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 5\u201317.

The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and [[Physiocracy|physiocratic economics]] were raised by the [[Enlightenment in Spain]] and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown [[Spanish American Enlightenment]]. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 27\u201334.

The Peninsular War began an extended period of instability in the worldwide Spanish monarchy that lasted until 1823. Napoleon's capture of the Bourbon monarchs precipitated a political crisis in Spain and Spanish America. Although the Spanish world almost uniformly rejected Napoleon's plan to place his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]], on the throne, there was no clear solution to the lack of a king. Following traditional Spanish political theories on the contractual nature of the monarchy (see [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez#Philosophy of law|Philosophy of Law of Francisco Su\u00e1rez]]), the peninsular provinces responded to the crisis by establishing [[Junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 551442|title = The Juntas of 1808 and the Spanish Colonies|journal = The English Historical Review|volume = 31|issue = 124|pages = 573\u2013585|last1 = Robertson|first1 = William Spence|year = 1916|doi = 10.1093/ehr/XXXI.CXXIV.573|url = https://zenodo.org/record/2416490}}</ref>  The move, however, led to more confusion, since there was no central authority and most juntas did not recognize the claim of some juntas to represent the monarchy as a whole. The Junta of Seville, in particular, claimed authority over the overseas empire, because of the province's historic role as the exclusive [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the empire.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 36\u201337.

It was agreed that the kingdoms of the peninsula would send two representatives to this Supreme Central Junta, and that the overseas kingdoms would send one representative each. These kingdoms were defined as \"the [[Viceroyalty|viceroyalties]] of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] (Mexico), [[Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa|Peru]], [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], and [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Buenos Aires]], and the independent [[Captaincy general|captaincies general]] of the island of [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Captaincy General of Chile|Chile]], Province of [[Venezuela Province|Venezuela]], and the [[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]].\"<ref>Royal Order of the Central Junta of January 22, 1809, cited in Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 60.</ref> This plan was criticized for providing unequal representation to Spanish America; nevertheless, throughout the end of 1808 and early 1809, the regional capitals elected candidates, whose names were forwarded to the capitals of the viceroyalties or captaincies general. Several important and large cities were left without direct representation in the Supreme Junta. In particular [[Quito]] and [[Sucre|Chuquisaca]], which saw themselves as the capitals of kingdoms, resented being subsumed in the larger [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] respectively.  This unrest led to the establishment of juntas in these cities in 1809, which were eventually quashed by the authorities within the year. An unsuccessful attempt at establishing a junta in New Spain was also stopped.\n\n===Spanish institutional revolution===\n{{Main|Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom|C\u00e1diz Cortes|Trienio Liberal|Provincial deputation in Spanish America}}\n[[File:Cortes_de_Cadiz.jpg|thumb|250px|Deputies of [[C\u00e1diz Cortes]] by territories]]\n\nThe escape to [[C\u00e1diz]] and the dissolution of the Supreme Central Junta on January 29, 1810, because of the reverses suffered after the [[Battle of Oca\u00f1a]] by the Spanish forces paid with Spanish American money,<ref>{{cite web | title = Batalla de Oca\u00f1a | work = Bicentenario de las independencias iberoam\u00e9ricanas | publisher = Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte (Spain) | url = http://pares.mcu.es/Bicentenarios/portal/batallaOcana.html | accessdate = 2012-08-17}}</ref> set off another wave of juntas being established in the Americas.

Political fault lines appeared, and were often the causes of military conflict.  On the one hand the juntas challenged the authority of all royal officials, whether they recognized the Regency or not. On the other hand, royal officials and Spanish Americans who desired to keep the empire together were split between liberals, who supported the efforts of the Cortes, and conservatives (often called \"[[Absolutism (European history)|absolutists]]\" in the historiography), who did not want to see any innovations in government. Finally, although the juntas claimed to carry out their actions in the name of the deposed king, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], their creation provided an opportunity for people who favored outright independence to promote their agenda publicly and safely. The proponents of independence called themselves patriots, a term which eventually was generally applied to them.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 36\u201337, 134\u2013135.

The congresses of Venezuela and New Granada did so in 1811 and also Paraguay in same year (14 and 15 of May 1811). Some historians explain the reluctance to declare independence as a \"mask of Ferdinand VII\": that is, that patriot leaders felt that they needed to claim loyalty to the deposed monarch in order to prepare the masses for the radical change that full independence eventually would entail.<ref>The phrase is used by Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 56\u201358, 133.

Overall, despite achieving formal or de facto independence, many regions of Spanish America were marked by nearly continuous civil wars, which lasted well into the 1820s. In Mexico, where the junta movement had been stopped in its early stages by a coalition of Peninsular merchants and government officials, efforts to establish a government independent of the Regency or the French took the form of rebellion, under the leadership of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]]. Hidalgo was captured and executed in 1811, but a resistance movement continued, which [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|declared independence from Spain in 1813]]. The [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]] was a joint Tejanos-US volunteers expedition formed in [[Louisiana]] for Texas independence but was defeated in the [[Battle of Medina]]. In Central America, [[1811 Independence Movement|attempts at establishing juntas]] were also put down, but resulted in significantly less violence. The Caribbean islands, like the Philippines on the other side of the world, were relatively peaceful. Any plots to set up juntas were denounced to the authorities early enough to stop them before they gained widespread support.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 107\u2013111, 134\u2013137, 162\u2013172, 195\u2013200, 238\u2013240, 313\u2013319, 335.

The disappearance of a central, imperial authority\u2014and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and R\u00edo de la Plata)\u2014initiated a prolonged period of [[balkanization]] in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the ''[[Fatherland|patria]]'' in Spanish.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 121, 131\u2013132. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 13\u201319, 22,</ref> More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also led some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with R\u00edo de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in R\u00edo de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 57\u201371, 162\u2013163, 240\u2013242. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 111\u2013113, 126\u2013136, 153\u2013159, 176\u2013179. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 53, 59.</ref>\n\n====Social and racial tensions====\n[[File:\u00c9xododeCaracasen1814.jpg|thumb|Exodus from the town of Caracas 1814]]\n\nUnderlying social and racial tensions also had a great impact on the nature of the fighting. Rural areas were pitted against urban centers, as grievances against the authorities found an outlet in the political conflict. This was the case with Hidalgo's peasant revolt, which was fueled as much by discontent over several years of bad harvests as with events in the Peninsular War. Hidalgo was originally part of a circle of liberal urbanites in [[Quer\u00e9taro, Quer\u00e9taro|Quer\u00e9taro]], who sought to establish a junta. After this conspiracy was discovered, Hidalgo turned to the rural people of the Mexican [[Baj\u00edo]] to build his army, and their interests soon overshadowed those of the urban intellectuals. A similar tension existed in Venezuela, where the Spanish immigrant [[Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Boves]] formed a powerful, though irregular, royalist army out of the ''[[Llanero]]s'', mixed-race slave and plains people, by attacking the white landowning class. Boves and his followers often disregarded the command of Spanish officials and were not concerned with actually re-establishing the toppled royal government, choosing instead to keep real power among themselves. Finally, in the back country of [[Upper Peru]], the ''[[republiqueta]]s'' kept the idea of independence alive by allying with disenfranchised members of rural society and native groups, but were never able to take the major population centers.\n\nIncreasingly violent confrontations developed between Spaniards and Spanish Americans, but this tension was often related to class issues or fomented by patriot leaders to create a new sense of nationalism. After being incited to rid the country of the ''gachupines'' (a disparaging term for ''Peninsulares''), Hidalgo's forces indiscriminately massacred hundreds of Criollos and ''Peninsulares'' who had taken refuge at the [[Alh\u00f3ndiga de Granaditas]] in Guanajuato. In Venezuela during his [[Admirable Campaign]], [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] instituted a policy of a [[Decree of War to the Death|war to the death]], in which royalist Spanish Americans would be purposely spared but even neutral ''Peninsulares'' would be killed, in order to drive a wedge between the two groups. This policy laid the ground for the violent royalist reaction under Boves. Often though, royalism or patriotism simply provided a banner to organize the aggrieved, and the political causes could be discarded just as quickly as they were picked up. The Venezuelan ''Llaneros'' switched to the patriot banner once the elites and the urban centers became securely royalist after 1815, and it was the royal army in Mexico that ultimately brought about that nation's independence.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 118\u2013121, 197\u2013198, 200, 204\u2013207, 306\u2013313.

In areas where royalists controlled the main population centers, most of the fighting by those seeking independence was done by isolated [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla bands]]. In New Spain, the two main guerrilla groups were led by [[Guadalupe Victoria]] in Puebla and [[Vicente Guerrero]] in Oaxaca. In northern South America, New Granadan and Venezuelan patriots, under leaders such as [[Military career of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], [[Santiago Mari\u00f1o]], [[Manuel Piar]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez]], carried out campaigns in the vast [[Orinoco|Orinoco River basin]] and along the Caribbean coast, often with material aid coming from [[Cura\u00e7ao]] and [[Haiti]].  Also, as mentioned above, in Upper Peru, guerrilla bands controlled the isolated, rural parts of the country.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 168, 184, Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 70, 97.</ref>\n\n====Restoration of Ferdinand VII====\n\nIn March 1814, following with the collapse of the [[First French Empire]], Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlantic\u2014the myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codes\u2014had been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from [[conservatism|conservatives]] in the general population and the hierarchy of the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Spain#19th century|Spanish Catholic Church]]; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took [[History of transport|goods and people to travel]] from Spain.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 169\u2013172. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 56\u201357.</ref>\n\nFerdinand's actions constituted a definitive de facto break both with the autonomous governments, which had not yet declared formal independence, and with the effort of Spanish liberals to create a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions. Such a government was seen as an alternative to independence by many in New Spain, Central America, the Caribbean, Quito, Peru, Upper Peru and Chile. Yet the news of the restoration of the \"[[Ancien R\u00e9gime|ancien r\u00e9gime]]\" did not initiate a new wave of juntas, as had happened in 1809 and 1810, with the notable exception of the establishment of a junta in [[Cusco|Cuzco]] demanding the implementation of the Spanish Constitution. Instead most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided to wait and see what would come out of the restoration of normalcy. In fact, in areas of New Spain, Central America and Quito, governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional ''[[Cabildo (council)|ayuntamientos]]'' in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 336. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 106.</ref> Liberals on both sides of the Atlantic, nevertheless, continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy, ultimately succeeding in 1820. The most dramatic example of transatlantic collaboration is perhaps [[Francisco Javier Mina]]'s expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 162. 171\u2013172, 207. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 173\u2013175, 192\u2013194</ref>\n\nSpanish Americans in royalist areas who were committed to independence had already joined the guerrilla movements. However, Ferdinand's actions did set areas outside of the control of the crown on the path to full independence. The governments of these regions, which had their origins in the juntas of 1810, and even moderates there, who had entertained a reconciliation with the crown, now saw the need to separate from Spain if they were to protect the reforms they had enacted.\n\n====Royalist military====\n{{Main|Spanish expeditionary army (Spanish American independence) order of battle}}\n[[File:Batalla-Rancagua.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Rancagua]] in 1814]]\n\nDuring this period, royalist forces made advances into New Granada, which they controlled from 1815 to 1819, and into Chile, which they controlled from 1814 to 1817. Except for royalist areas in the northeast and south, the provinces of New Granada had maintained independence from Spain since 1810, unlike neighboring Venezuela, where royalists and pro-independence forces had exchanged control of the region several times. To pacify Venezuela and to retake New Granada, Spain organized in 1815 the largest armed force it ever sent to the New World, consisting of 10,500 troops and nearly sixty ships.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 209. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 122. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 57.</ref><ref>Small contingents from Spain had been arriving in the Americas since 1810.  On August 25, 1810, a group of [[Spanish Navy Marines|Spanish Marines]] arrived in [[Veracruz]] from [[C\u00e1diz]] on the [[frigate]], ''Nuestra se\u00f1ora de Atocha'' under the command of [[Rosendo Porlier y Asteguieta|Rosendo Porlier]] and accompanying Viceroy [[Francisco Javier Venegas]].  These were the first Spaniards to have come from Europe in support of [[royalist]]s. Frieyro de Lara. ''Guerra ej\u00e9rcito y sociedad en el nacimiento de la Espa\u00f1a contempor\u00e1nea''. (2009, Universidad de Granada) p. 660.</ref> (See, [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada]].) Although this force was crucial in retaking a solidly pro-independence region like New Granada, its soldiers were eventually spread out throughout Venezuela, New Granada, Quito, and Peru and were lost to tropical diseases, diluting their impact on the war.<ref>Rebecca Earle, \"'A Grave for Europeans'? Disease, Death, and the Spanish-American Revolutions\" in Christon I. Archer, ed. ''The Wars of Independence in Spanish America'', 283\u2013297.</ref> More importantly, the majority of the royalist forces were composed, not of soldiers sent from the peninsula, but of Spanish Americans.\n\nOverall, Europeans formed only about a tenth of the royalist armies in Spanish America, and only about half of the expeditionary units, once they were deployed in the Americas. Since each European soldier casualty was replaced by a Spanish American soldier, over time, there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units. For example, [[Pablo Morillo]], commander in chief of the expeditionary force sent to South America, reported that he had only 2,000 European soldiers under his command in 1820; in other words, only half the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European. It is estimated that in the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]] only a quarter of the royalist forces were European soldiers, in the [[Battle of Carabobo]] about a fifth, and in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] less than 1% was European.\n\nThe American militias reflected the racial make-up of the local population. For example, in 1820 the royalist army in Venezuela had 843 white (''espa\u00f1ol''), 5,378 [[Casta]] and 980 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] soldiers.\n[[File:Royalist Hispanic American.png|thumb|600px|center|Royalist army]]\n\n====Pro-independence advances====\n{{Main|Crossing of the Andes|Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada}}\n\nTowards the end of this period the pro-independence forces made two important advances. In the [[Southern Cone]], a veteran of the Spanish army with experience in the Peninsular War, [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], became the governor of the [[Province of Cuyo]]. He used this position to begin organizing an army as early as 1814 in preparation for an invasion of Chile. This was an important change in strategy after [[Army of the North|three United Provinces campaigns]] had been defeated in [[Upper Peru]]. San Mart\u00edn's army became the nucleus of the [[Army of the Andes]], which received crucial political and material support in 1816 when [[Juan Mart\u00edn de Pueyrred\u00f3n]] became [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Supreme Director]] of the [[United Provinces of South America|United Provinces]]. In January 1817, San Mart\u00edn was finally ready to advance against the royalists in Chile. Ignoring an injunction from the congress of the R\u00edo de la Plata not to move against Chile, San Mart\u00edn together with General [[Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme]], later Supreme Director of Chile, led the Army over the Andes in a move that turned the tables on the royalists. By February 10, San Mart\u00edn had control of northern and central Chile, and a year later, after a [[Guerra a muerte|war with no quarter]], the south. With the aid of a fleet under the command of former British naval officer [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]], Chile was secured from royalist control and independence was declared that year. San Mart\u00edn and his allies spent the next two years planning an invasion of Peru, which began in 1820.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 138\u2013141. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 179\u2013182. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 72\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn northern South America, after several failed campaigns to take Caracas and other urban centers of Venezuela, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] devised a similar plan in 1819 to cross the Andes and liberate New Granada from the royalists. Like San Mart\u00edn, Bol\u00edvar personally undertook the efforts to create an army to invade a neighboring country, collaborated with pro-independence exiles from that region, and lacked the approval of the [[Congress of Angostura|Venezuelan congress]]. Unlike San Mart\u00edn, however, Bol\u00edvar did not have a professionally trained army, but rather a quickly assembled mix of ''Llanero'' guerrillas, New Granadan exiles led by Santander and [[British Legions|British recruits]]. From June to July 1819, using the [[Wet season|rainy season]] as cover, Bol\u00edvar led his army across the flooded plains and over the cold, forbidding passes of the Andes, with heavy losses\u2014a quarter of the British Legion perished, as well as many of his ''Llanero'' soldiers, who were not prepared for the nearly 4,000-meter altitudes\u2014but the gamble paid off. By August Bol\u00edvar was in control of [[Bogot\u00e1]] and its treasury, and gained the support of many in New Granada, which still resented the harsh reconquest carried out under Morillo. Nevertheless, Santander found it necessary to continue the policy of the \"war to the death\" and carried out the execution of thirty-eight royalist officers who had surrendered. With the resources of New Granada, Bol\u00edvar became the undisputed leader of the patriots in Venezuela and orchestrated the union of the two regions in a new state called [[Gran Colombia|Colombia (Gran Colombia)]].<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 209\u2013218. {{cite book | last = MacKenzie| first = S.

This force, however, never left Spain. Instead, it became the means by which liberals were finally able to reinstate a constitutional regime. On January 1, 1820, [[Rafael del Riego|Rafael Riego]], commander of the Asturias Battalion, headed a rebellion among the troops, demanding the return of the 1812 Constitution. His troops marched through the cities of [[Andalusia]] with the hope of extending the uprising to the civilian population, but locals were mostly indifferent. An uprising, however, did occur in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in northern Spain, and from there it quickly spread throughout the country. On March 7, the royal palace in Madrid was surrounded by soldiers under the command of General [[Francisco Ballesteros]], and three days later, on March 10, the besieged Ferdinand VII, now a virtual prisoner, agreed to restore the Constitution.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 194.

Militarily, the large numbers of reinforcements, which were especially needed to retake New Granada and defend the Viceroyalty of Peru, would never arrive. Furthermore, as the royalists' situation became more desperate in region after region, the army experienced wholesale defections of units to the patriot side. Politically, the reinstitution of a liberal regime changed the terms under which the Spanish government sought to engage the insurgents. The new government naively assumed that the insurgents were fighting for Spanish liberalism and that the Spanish Constitution could still be the basis of reconciliation between the two sides. The government implemented the Constitution and held elections in the overseas provinces, just as in Spain. It also ordered military commanders to begin armistice negotiations with the insurgents with the promise that they could participate in the restored representative government.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 335\u2013340.

The simple terms that Iturbide proposed became the basis of the [[Plan of Iguala]]: the independence of New Spain (now to be called the Mexican Empire) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state religion and the protection of its [[Fuero|existing privileges]]; and the equality of all New Spaniards, whether immigrants or native-born. The following month the other important guerrilla leader, [[Guadalupe Victoria]], joined the alliance, and on March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new [[Army of the Three Guarantees]]. The representative of the new Spanish government, Superior Political Chief [[Juan O'Donoj\u00fa]], who replaced the previous viceroys, arrived in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] on July 1, 1821, but he found that royalists held the entire country except for Veracruz, Mexico City and [[Acapulco]]. Since at the time that O'Donoj\u00fa had left Spain, the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions, O'Donoj\u00fa proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala. The resulting [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]], which was signed on August 24, kept all existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, in force until a new constitution for Mexico could be written. O'Donoj\u00fa became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8. Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba, and the final break with the mother country came on May 19, 1822, when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on Iturbide.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 320\u2013323.

On September 15, 1821, an [[Act of Independence of Central America|Act of Independence]] was signed in Guatemala City which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported the terms of the Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 333\u2013340.

[[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] inadvertently led a continent-wide [[pincer movement]] from southern and northern South America that liberated most of the [[Hispanic America|Spanish American nations]] on that continent. After securing the [[Chilean War of Independence|independence of Chile]] in 1818, San Mart\u00edn concentrated on building a naval fleet in the Pacific to counter [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] control of those waters and reach the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist stronghold]] of [[Lima]]. By mid-1820 San Mart\u00edn had assembled a fleet of eight warships and sixteen transport ships under the command of Admiral Cochrane. The fleet set sail from [[Valpara\u00edso]] to [[Paracas Bay|Paracas]] in southern [[Peru]]. On September 7, the army landed at Paracas and successfully took [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]]. After this, San Mart\u00edn, waiting for a generalized Peruvian revolt, chose to avoid direct military confrontation. San Mart\u00edn hoped that his presence would initiate an authentic [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peruvian revolt]] against Spanish rule, believing that otherwise any liberation would be ephemeral. In the meantime, San Mart\u00edn engaged in diplomacy with Viceroy [[Joaqu\u00edn de la Pezuela]], who was under orders from the constitutional government to negotiate on the basis of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]] and to maintain the unity of the [[Spanish Crown|Spanish Monarchy]]. However, these efforts proved fruitless, since independence and unity of the monarchy could not be reconciled, so the army sailed in late October to a better strategic position in [[Huacho]], in northern Peru. During the next few months, successful land and naval campaigns against the royalists secured the new foothold, and it was at Huacho that San Mart\u00edn learned that [[Guayaquil]] (in [[Ecuador]]) had declared independence on October 9.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 172\u2013178.

Bol\u00edvar was aided by Spain's new policy of seeking engagement with the insurgents, which Morillo implemented, renouncing to the command in chief, and returning to Spain. Although Bol\u00edvar rejected the Spanish proposal that the patriots rejoin Spain under the Spanish Constitution, the two sides established a six-month [[Ceasefire|truce]] and the regularization of the [[rules of engagement]] under the [[Jus gentium|law of nations]] on November 25 and 26. The truce did not last six months. It was apparent to all that the royalist cause had been greatly weakened by the lack of reinforcements. Royalist soldiers and whole units began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers. On January 28, 1821, the ''[[cabildo (council)|ayuntamiento]]'' of [[Maracaibo]] declared the province an independent republic that chose to join the new [[nation-state]] of [[Gran Colombia]]. [[Miguel de la Torre]], who had replaced Morillo as head of the army, took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed when Bol\u00edvar returned there in April leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on June 24, the Gran Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela save for [[Puerto Cabello]] and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Bol\u00edvar could now concentrate on Gran Colombia's claims to southern New Granada and Quito.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 218\u2013219.

During the next few months [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|San Mart\u00edn]] once again engaged in negotiations, offering the creation of an independent monarchy; but La Serna insisted on the unity of the Spanish monarchy, so the negotiations came to nothing. By July La Serna judged his hold on Lima to be weak, and on July 8 the royal army abandoned the coastal city in order to reinforce positions in the highlands, with [[Cusco|Cuzco]] as new capital of the viceroyalty. On the 12th [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|San Mart\u00edn]] entered Lima, where he was declared \"Protector of the Country\" on July 28, an office which allowed him to rule the newly independent state.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 178\u2013179.

For a year Sucre was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides, exhausted, signed a ninety-day armistice. The following year, at the [[Battle of Pichincha]] on May 24, 1822, Sucre's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito; Gran Colombia's hold on the territory was secure. The following year, after a Peruvian patriot army was destroyed in the [[Battle of Ica]], San Mart\u00edn met with Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar in [[Guayaquil]] on July 26 and 27. Thereafter San Mart\u00edn decided to retire from the scene. For the next two years, two armies of ''Rioplatense'' (Argentinian), Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian patriots were destroyed trying to penetrate the royalist bastion in the [[Andean]] regions of Peru and [[Upper Peru]]. A year later a Peruvian congress resolved to make Bol\u00edvar head of the patriot forces in the country. An internecine conflict between La Serna and General Pedro Antonio Ola\u00f1eta, which was an extension of the [[Trienio Liberal|Liberal Triennium]], proved to be the royalists' undoing.

La Serna's army was numerically superior but consisted of mostly new recruits. The only significant royalist area remaining on the continent was the highland country of [[Upper Peru]]. Following the Battle of Ayacucho, the royalist troops of Upper Peru under the command of Ola\u00f1eta surrendered after he died in [[Nor Chichas Province|Tumusla]] on April 2, 1825.

Early, in 1822, the United States recognized [[Chile]], the [[United Provinces of South America|United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], Peru, [[Gran Colombia]], and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and R\u00edo de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years.<ref>Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 105\u2013106.</ref>\n\n====Last royalist bastions====\n[[File:Batalla de Pueblo Viejo.jpg|thumb|300px|Spain fails to reconquer Mexico at the [[Isidro Barradas|Battle of Tampico]] in 1829]]\n\nThe Spanish coastal fortifications in [[Veracruz]], [[Callao]] and [[Chilo\u00e9]] were the footholds that resisted until 1825 and 1826 respectively. In the following decade, royalist guerrillas continued to operate in several countries and Spain launched a few attempts to retake parts of the Spanish American mainland. In 1827 Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Arizabalo]] started an irregular war with Venezuelan guerrillas, and Brigadier [[Isidro Barradas]] led the last attempt with regular troops to reconquer Mexico in 1829. The [[Pincheira brothers]] moved to Patagonia and remained there as royalist outlaws until defeated in 1832. But efforts like these did not reverse the new political situation.\n\nThe increasing irrelevance of the [[Holy Alliance]] after 1825 and the fall of the Bourbon dynasty in France in 1830 during the [[July Revolution]] eliminated the principal support of Ferdinand VII in Europe, but it was not until the king's death in 1833 that Spain finally abandoned all plans of military reconquest, and in 1836 its government went so far as to renounce sovereignty over all of continental America. During the course of the 19th century, Spain would recognize each of the new states.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OxcpEbVzMpQC Costeloe, Michael P. ''Response to Revolution'', 100]</ref> Only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898.\n\n==Effects of independence==\n\n===Economics===\nThe nearly decade and a half of wars greatly weakened the Spanish American economies and political institutions, which hindered the region's potential [[economic development]] for most of the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced. Independence destroyed the de facto [[trade bloc]] that was the Spanish Empire - [[Manila galleon]]s and [[Spanish treasure fleet]]s in particular. After independence, trade ''among'' the new Spanish American nations was less than it had been in the colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to expediency, protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-[[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 344\u2013347.

Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 347\u2013351.

In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free-womb laws and programs for [[compensated emancipation]]. By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 347\u2013349.</ref>\n\n===Role of women===\n[[File:Juana Azurduy.jpg|thumb|[[Juana Azurduy de Padilla]], a [[Mestizo|Mestiza]] leader of independence in Rio de la Plata.]]\n\nWomen were not simply spectators throughout the Independence Wars of Latin America. Many women took sides on political issues and joined independence movements in order to participate on many different levels. Women could not help but act as caring relatives either as mother, sister, wives or daughters of the men who were fighting. Women created political organizations and organized meetings and groups to donate food and supplies to the soldiers.\n\nSome women supported the wars as spies, informants and combatants. [[Manuela S\u00e1enz]] was a long term lover of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] and acted as his spy and confidante and was secretary of his archive. She saved his life on two occasions, nursed wounded soldiers and has even been believed some historians to have fought in a few battles. S\u00e1enz followed Bol\u00edvar and his army through the independence wars and became to be known in Latin America as the \u201cmother of feminism and women's emancipation and equal rights.\u201d\nBol\u00edvar himself was a supporter of women's rights and suffrage in Latin America. It was Bol\u00edvar who allowed for S\u00e1enz to become the great pioneer of women's freedom. He wanted to set the women of Latin America free from the oppression and inferiority of what the Spanish regime had established.  Bol\u00edvar even made S\u00e1enz a Colonel of the Colombian Army due to her heroics which caused controversy because there were no women in the army at the time. Another woman who gained prominence in the fight for independence was [[Juana Azurduy de Padilla]], a mixed-race woman who fought for independence in the R\u00edo de la Plata region. Argentine President [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] posthumously promoted her to the rank of general.<ref>The Argentine President promotes Juana Azurduy to General in the Argentine Army.www.szmm.gov.hu/download.php?ctag=download&docID=14380</ref>\n\nAccording to gender stereotypes, women were not meant to be soldiers; only men were supposed to engage in fighting and conflict. There were still plenty of women present on the battlefields to help rescue and nurse soldiers. Some women fought alongside their husbands and sons on the battlefield. The majority of women assumed supportive and non-competitive roles such as fundraising and caring for the sick. Revolution for women meant something different than for men. Women saw revolution as a way to earn equal rights, such as voting, and to overcome the suppression of subordination of women to men.\nWomen were usually identified as victims during the independence wars since the women of Latin America were forced to sacrifice for the cause. The ideals of womanhood meant that women must sacrifice what the situation required such as a mother sacrificing her son or a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or marriage due to the loss of many young men. This view meant that women were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics in the hands of the men.<ref>\u201d O\u2019Connor, Mothers Making Latin America\u201d, 26-27.</ref>\n\n===Government and politics===\n{{see also|Treaties to recognise the Spanish American independence}}\n[[File:Spanish Empire - 1824.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Map of territories that became independent during those wars (blue)]]\nIndependence also did not result in stable political regimes, save in a few countries. First, the new nations did not have well-defined identities, but rather the process of creating identities was only beginning. This would be carried out through newspapers and the creation of national symbols, including new names for the countries (\"Mexico\", \"Colombia\", \"Ecuador\", \"Bolivia\", \"Argentina\"), that broke with the past. In addition, the borders were not firmly established, and the struggle between [[federalism]] and [[Centralized government|centralism]], which began in independence, continued throughout the rest of the century. Two large states that emerged from the wars\u2014[[Gran Colombia]] and the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]\u2014collapsed after a decade or two, and Argentina would not [[Constitution of Argentina|consolidate politically]] until the 1860s.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 342\u2013343. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 146\u2013152.</ref>\n\nThe wars destroyed  the old civilian bureaucracy that had governed the region for centuries, as institutions such as the [[Audiencia Real|audiencias]] were eliminated and many ''Peninsular'' officials fled to Spain. The Catholic Church, which had been an important social and political institution during the colonial period, initially came out weakened by the end of the conflicts. As with government officials, many ''Peninsular'' bishops abandoned their dioceses and their posts were not filled for decades until new prelates could be created and relations between the new nations and the [[Pope|Vatican]] were regularized. Then as the Church recovered, its economic and political power was attacked by liberals.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 351\u2013352. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 145\u2013146, 152\u2013153.</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that the period of the wars of independence itself was marked by a rapid expansion of [[Representative democracy|representative government]],<ref>Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 3\u20135, 213, 239.

The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the [[caudillo]]s, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 341\u2013342, 352\u2013355.

Although there has been research on the idea of a separate Spanish American (\"creole\") identity separate from that of [[Iberia]],<ref>D.A.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2017.</ref> With the restoration of [[Ferdinand VII]] in 1814, the King rejected any type of [[Popular sovereignty]] ([[Junta (Spanish American Independence)|Junta]] or [[Cortes of C\u00e1diz|Cortes]]). The [[Trienio Liberal|Liberal Triennium]] of 1820 also did not change the position of the C\u00e1diz [[constitution of 1812]] against separatism, while Latin Americans were increasingly radicalized seeking political independence.<ref>Timothy Anna,\"Review\", [[American Historical Review]] vol. 123 (3) 2018, pp. 985-86.</ref>\n\nThe violent conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived [[junta (Peninsular War)|governing juntas]] established in [[Chuquisaca Revolution|Chuquisaca]] and [[Quito#Colony|Quito]] in opposing the government of the [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom|Supreme Central Junta of Seville]]. In 1810, [[Retroversion of the sovereignty to the people|numerous new juntas]] appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas when the Central Junta fell to the French invasion. Although various regions of Spanish America objected to many crown policies, \"there was little interest in outright independence; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French.\"<ref>David Bushnell, \" Wars of Independence: South America\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 5, p. 446. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref> While some Spanish Americans believed that independence was necessary, most who initially supported the creation of the new governments saw them as a means to preserve the region's autonomy from the French. Over the course of the next decade, the political instability in Spain and the [[History of Spain (1814\u201373)#Reaction (1814\u201320)|absolutist restoration]] under Ferdinand VII convinced many Spanish Americans of the need to formally establish independence from the [[metropole|mother country]].\n\nThese conflicts were fought both as [[irregular warfare]] and [[conventional warfare]]. These wars began as localized [[civil war]]s<ref>{{cite book |last=Kinsbruner |first=Jay |date=1994 |title= Independence in Spanish America: Civil Wars, Revolutions, and Underdevelopment|location= |publisher= University of New Mexico press |page= |isbn=978-0826321770}}</ref> that later spread and expanded to promote general independence from Spanish rule.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=HAMNETT|first=BRIAN R.|date=May 1997|title=Process and Pattern: A Re-examination of the Ibero-American Independence Movements, 1808\u20131826|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=29|issue=2|pages=279\u2013328|doi=10.1017/s0022216x97004719|issn=0022-216X|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7a20e9156618c1161d9c17f8b902ffc244540958}}</ref> This independence led to the development of new national boundaries based on the [[Provincial deputation in Spanish America|colonial provinces]], which would form the future independent countries that constitute contemporary Latin America during the early 19th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under [[Spain under the Restoration|Spanish rule]] until the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898. The new republics from the beginning abolished the formal system of racial classification and hierarchy, [[Casta|casta system]], the [[Inquisition]], and noble titles. Slavery was not abolished immediately but ended in all of the new nations within a quarter century. [[Criollo people|Criollos]] (those of Spanish descent born in the New World) and [[mestizo]]s (those of mixed American Indian and Spanish blood or culture) replaced [[Peninsulars|Spanish-born]] appointees in most political governments. Criollos remained at the top of a social structure that retained some of its traditional features culturally, if not legally. For almost a century thereafter, [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|conservatives and liberals]] fought to reverse or to deepen the social and political changes unleashed by those rebellions.\n\nThe events in Spanish America were related to the [[war of independence|wars of independence]] in the former French colony of St-Domingue, [[Haiti]], and the transition to independence in Brazil. [[Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]], in particular, shared a common starting point with that of Spanish America, since both conflicts were triggered by Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, which forced the Portuguese royal family [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|to flee to Brazil]] in 1807. The process of Latin American independence took place in the general political and intellectual climate that emerged from the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and that influenced all of the [[Atlantic Revolutions]], including the earlier revolutions in the [[American Revolution|United States]] and [[French Revolution|France]]. A more direct cause of the Spanish American wars of independence were the unique developments occurring within the [[History of Spain (1814\u201373)|Kingdom of Spain]] and its [[monarchy of Spain|monarchy]] during this era.\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:Hisparevol.gif|thumb|250px|<br />'''Development of Spanish American Independence'''<br />{{legend |#FF0000|Government under traditional Spanish law}}{{legend |#FFA500|Loyal to Supreme Central Junta or Cortes}}{{legend |#FFFF00|American junta or insurrection movement}}{{legend |#008000|Independent state declared or established}}{{legend |#000080|Height of French control of the Peninsula}}]]\n\nPolitical independence was not necessarily the foreordained outcome of the political turmoil in Spanish America. \"There was little interest in outright independence.\"<ref>[[David Bushnell]], \"Wars of Independence: South America\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 5, p. 446.

Moya, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2011, p. 154.</ref> when Spanish American independence did occur, explanations for why it came about have been sought. The Latin American Wars of Independence were essentially led by European diaspora against European empires.\n\nThere are a number of factors that have been identified. First, increasing control by the Crown of its overseas empire via the [[Bourbon Reforms]] of the mid-eighteenth century introduced changes to the relationship of Spanish Americans to the Crown. The language used to describe the overseas empire shifted from \"kingdoms\" with independent standing with the crown to \"colonies\" subordinate to Spain.<ref>Mark A. Burkholder,(2016) \"Spain's America: from kingdoms to colonies, ''Colonial Latin American Review'', 25:2, 125-153, DOI: 10.1080/10609164.2016.1205241</ref> In an effort to better control the administration and economy of the overseas possessions the Crown reintroduced the practice of appointing outsiders, almost all ''[[peninsulars]]'', to the royal offices throughout the empire. This meant that Spanish American elites were thwarted in their expectations and ambitions by the crown's upending of long-standing practices of creole access to office holding.<ref>Mark A. Burkholder and D.S. Chandler, ''From Impotence to Authority: The Spanish Crown and the American Audiencias, 1687-1808''. Columbia: University of Missouri Press 1977.</ref>\n\nThe regalist and secularizing policies of the Bourbon monarchy were aimed at decreasing the power of the Roman Catholic Church. The crown had already [[expulsion of the Jesuits|expelled the Jesuits]] in 1767, which saw many creole members of the Society of Jesus go into permanent exile. By limiting the power of the Church, the crown attempted to centralize itself within the institutions of colonial Latin America. Because of the physical and ideological proximity that the clergy had,<ref name=\":1\">Mills, Kenneth; Taylor, William B.; Lauderdale Graham, Sandra (2002). ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History''. Maryland: SP Books. p. 144.</ref> they could directly influence and dictate the interactions between populations of colonial Latin America, either as legal counsel or an advisor;<ref name=\":2\">Mills, Kenneth; Taylor, William B. Taylor; Lauderdale Graham, Sandra (2002). ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History''. Maryland: SR Books. p. 107.</ref> a directness which the crown would need to attempt to create the centralized, colonial state which it wanted to implement.\n\nLater in the eighteenth century the crown sought to decrease the privileges (''fueros'') of the clergy, restricting clerical authority to spiritual matters and undermining the power of parish priests, who often acted as agents of the crown in rural parishes.<ref>[[Nancy Farriss]], ''Crown and Clergy in Colonial Mexico, 1759-1821''. London: Athlone Press 1968.</ref>  By desacralizing power and frontal attacks on the clergy, the crown, according to [[William B. Taylor (historian)|William B. Taylor]], undermined its own legitimacy, since parish priests had been traditionally the \"natural local representatives of their Catholic king.\"<ref>William B. Taylor, \"Early Latin American Social History\" in ''Reliving the Past: The Worlds of Social History''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1985, p. 149.</ref>\n\nIn the economic sphere, the crown sought to gain control over church revenues. The Church functioned as one of the largest economic institutions within colonial Latin America. It owned and retained jurisdiction over large amounts of land,<ref name=\":1\" /> which the crown wanted for itself because of the economic value which could be derived from the land.<ref>Mills, Kenneth; Taylor, William B.; Lauderdale Graham, Sandra (2002). ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History''. Maryland: SP Books. p. 309-313.</ref> Moreover, by taking that land for itself, the Crown had the opportunity to cut down the physical presence of the Church to further weaken its ideological and social role within local colonial communities.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn a financial crisis of 1804, the crown attempted to call in debts owed the church, mainly in the form of mortgages for [[hacienda]]s owned by the elites. The Act of Consolidation simultaneously threatened the wealth of the church, whose capital was mainly lent for mortgages, as well as threatening the financial well-being of elites, who depended on mortgages for acquiring and keeping their estates.  Shortening the repayment period meant many elites were faced with bankruptcy.<ref>Margaret Chowning, \"The ''Consolidaci\u00f3n de Vales Reales'' in the Bishopric of Michoac\u00e1n.\" ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 69:3 (1989) 451-78.</ref> The crown also sought to gain access to benefices elite families set aside to support a priest, often their own family members, by eliminating these endowed funds (''capellan\u00edas'') that the lower clergy depended on disproportionately.<ref>Michael P. Costeloe, ''Church Wealth in Mexico: A Study of the \"Juzgado de Capellan\u00edas\" in the Archbishopric of Mexico, 1800\u20131856.'' Cambridge University Press 1967.</ref>  Prominently in Mexico, lower clergy participated in the insurgency for independence with priests [[Miguel Hidalgo]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]].\n\nThe reforms had mixed results. In some areas\u2014such as [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|R\u00edo de la Plata]] and [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]\u2014the reforms had positive effects, improving the local economy and the efficiency of the government.<ref>Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions'', 17\u201319, 334\u2013335. Rodr\u00edguez, ''The Independence of Spanish America'', 19\u201327. Kinsbruner,  ''Independence in Spanish America'', 7\u201312.</ref>   In other areas, the changes in the crown's economic and administrative policies led to tensions with locals, which at times erupted into open revolts, such as the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|Revolt of the Comuneros]] in [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] and the [[Rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II]] in [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]].\n\nThe loss of high offices to Peninsulars and the eighteenth-century revolts in Spanish South America were the some of the direct causes of the wars of independence, which took place decades later, but they have been considered important elements of the political background in which the wars took place.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 5\u201317. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 24\u201325. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 12\u201314, 17\u201332.</ref> Many Creoles, particularly the wealthy creoles, were negatively impacted by the Bourbon Reforms.<ref name=\":0\" /> This resulted in their taking action by using their wealth and positions within society, often as leaders within their communities, to spur resistance to convey their displeasure with Spanish reforms because of the negative economic impact which they had.<ref name=\":3\">Lynch, John (2001), \"Spanish America's Poor Whites: Canarian Immigrants in Venezuela, 1700\u20131830\", ''Latin America between Colony and Nation'', Palgrave Macmillan UK, pp. 58\u201373, {{ISBN|978-1-349-41856-5}}, retrieved 2020-01-13</ref> However, because of how quickly their revolts would further radicalize the lower classes, the Creoles quickly stopped supporting general violent insurrection because they benefitted from social change that occurred through the systems of the Spanish crown.<ref name=\":3\" /> Institutional change ensured stability by supporting the political institutions that allowed for the creation of a wealthy Creole class and further adapting those institutions to meet demands, rather than propose a radical shift in the complete make-up of socioeconomic life and traditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, institutional change did not come as anticipated and further spurred on the radicalization of Spanish-American social classes towards independence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOther factors may include [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking and the examples of the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and [[Physiocracy|physiocratic economics]] were raised by the [[Enlightenment in Spain]] and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown [[Spanish American Enlightenment]]. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 27\u201334.

The Peninsular War began an extended period of instability in the worldwide Spanish monarchy that lasted until 1823. Napoleon's capture of the Bourbon monarchs precipitated a political crisis in Spain and Spanish America. Although the Spanish world almost uniformly rejected Napoleon's plan to place his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]], on the throne, there was no clear solution to the lack of a king. Following traditional Spanish political theories on the contractual nature of the monarchy (see [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez#Philosophy of law|Philosophy of Law of Francisco Su\u00e1rez]]), the peninsular provinces responded to the crisis by establishing [[Junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 551442|title = The Juntas of 1808 and the Spanish Colonies|journal = The English Historical Review|volume = 31|issue = 124|pages = 573\u2013585|last1 = Robertson|first1 = William Spence|year = 1916|doi = 10.1093/ehr/XXXI.CXXIV.573|url = https://zenodo.org/record/2416490}}</ref>  The move, however, led to more confusion, since there was no central authority and most juntas did not recognize the claim of some juntas to represent the monarchy as a whole. The Junta of Seville, in particular, claimed authority over the overseas empire, because of the province's historic role as the exclusive [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the empire.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 36\u201337. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 51\u201356, 58\u201359. Kinsbruner,  ''Independence in Spanish America'', 12, 35\u201337.</ref>\n\nThis impasse was resolved through negotiations between the several juntas in Spain counted with the participation of the [[Council of Castile]], which led to the creation of a main government: the \"[[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom (Spain)|Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies]]\" on September 25, 1808. It was agreed that the kingdoms of the peninsula would send two representatives to this Supreme Central Junta, and that the overseas kingdoms would send one representative each. These kingdoms were defined as \"the [[Viceroyalty|viceroyalties]] of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] (Mexico), [[Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa|Peru]], [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], and [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Buenos Aires]], and the independent [[Captaincy general|captaincies general]] of the island of [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Captaincy General of Chile|Chile]], Province of [[Venezuela Province|Venezuela]], and the [[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]].\"<ref>Royal Order of the Central Junta of January 22, 1809, cited in Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 60.</ref> This plan was criticized for providing unequal representation to Spanish America; nevertheless, throughout the end of 1808 and early 1809, the regional capitals elected candidates, whose names were forwarded to the capitals of the viceroyalties or captaincies general. Several important and large cities were left without direct representation in the Supreme Junta. In particular [[Quito]] and [[Sucre|Chuquisaca]], which saw themselves as the capitals of kingdoms, resented being subsumed in the larger [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] respectively.  This unrest led to the establishment of juntas in these cities in 1809, which were eventually quashed by the authorities within the year. An unsuccessful attempt at establishing a junta in New Spain was also stopped.\n\n===Spanish institutional revolution===\n{{Main|Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom|C\u00e1diz Cortes|Trienio Liberal|Provincial deputation in Spanish America}}\n[[File:Cortes_de_Cadiz.jpg|thumb|250px|Deputies of [[C\u00e1diz Cortes]] by territories]]\n\nThe escape to [[C\u00e1diz]] and the dissolution of the Supreme Central Junta on January 29, 1810, because of the reverses suffered after the [[Battle of Oca\u00f1a]] by the Spanish forces paid with Spanish American money,<ref>{{cite web | title = Batalla de Oca\u00f1a | work = Bicentenario de las independencias iberoam\u00e9ricanas | publisher = Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte (Spain) | url = http://pares.mcu.es/Bicentenarios/portal/batallaOcana.html | accessdate = 2012-08-17}}</ref> set off another wave of juntas being established in the Americas.

Next, in order to establish a more legitimate government system, the Regency called for the convening of an \"extraordinary and general [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] of the Spanish Nation\": the \"[[C\u00e1diz Cortes]]\".

Political fault lines appeared, and were often the causes of military conflict.  On the one hand the juntas challenged the authority of all royal officials, whether they recognized the Regency or not. On the other hand, royal officials and Spanish Americans who desired to keep the empire together were split between liberals, who supported the efforts of the Cortes, and conservatives (often called \"[[Absolutism (European history)|absolutists]]\" in the historiography), who did not want to see any innovations in government. Finally, although the juntas claimed to carry out their actions in the name of the deposed king, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], their creation provided an opportunity for people who favored outright independence to promote their agenda publicly and safely. The proponents of independence called themselves patriots, a term which eventually was generally applied to them.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 36\u201337, 134\u2013135. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 52\u201353. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 45\u201346, 53.</ref>\n\nThe idea that independence was not the initial concern is evidenced by the fact that few areas declared independence in the years after 1810. The congresses of Venezuela and New Granada did so in 1811 and also Paraguay in same year (14 and 15 of May 1811). Some historians explain the reluctance to declare independence as a \"mask of Ferdinand VII\": that is, that patriot leaders felt that they needed to claim loyalty to the deposed monarch in order to prepare the masses for the radical change that full independence eventually would entail.<ref>The phrase is used by Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 56\u201358, 133.

Overall, despite achieving formal or de facto independence, many regions of Spanish America were marked by nearly continuous civil wars, which lasted well into the 1820s. In Mexico, where the junta movement had been stopped in its early stages by a coalition of Peninsular merchants and government officials, efforts to establish a government independent of the Regency or the French took the form of rebellion, under the leadership of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]]. Hidalgo was captured and executed in 1811, but a resistance movement continued, which [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|declared independence from Spain in 1813]]. The [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]] was a joint Tejanos-US volunteers expedition formed in [[Louisiana]] for Texas independence but was defeated in the [[Battle of Medina]]. In Central America, [[1811 Independence Movement|attempts at establishing juntas]] were also put down, but resulted in significantly less violence. The Caribbean islands, like the Philippines on the other side of the world, were relatively peaceful. Any plots to set up juntas were denounced to the authorities early enough to stop them before they gained widespread support.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 107\u2013111, 134\u2013137, 162\u2013172, 195\u2013200, 238\u2013240, 313\u2013319, 335.

The disappearance of a central, imperial authority\u2014and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and R\u00edo de la Plata)\u2014initiated a prolonged period of [[balkanization]] in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the ''[[Fatherland|patria]]'' in Spanish.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 121, 131\u2013132. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 13\u201319, 22,</ref> More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also led some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with R\u00edo de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in R\u00edo de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 57\u201371, 162\u2013163, 240\u2013242. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 111\u2013113, 126\u2013136, 153\u2013159, 176\u2013179. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 53, 59.</ref>\n\n====Social and racial tensions====\n[[File:\u00c9xododeCaracasen1814.jpg|thumb|Exodus from the town of Caracas 1814]]\n\nUnderlying social and racial tensions also had a great impact on the nature of the fighting. Rural areas were pitted against urban centers, as grievances against the authorities found an outlet in the political conflict. This was the case with Hidalgo's peasant revolt, which was fueled as much by discontent over several years of bad harvests as with events in the Peninsular War. Hidalgo was originally part of a circle of liberal urbanites in [[Quer\u00e9taro, Quer\u00e9taro|Quer\u00e9taro]], who sought to establish a junta. After this conspiracy was discovered, Hidalgo turned to the rural people of the Mexican [[Baj\u00edo]] to build his army, and their interests soon overshadowed those of the urban intellectuals. A similar tension existed in Venezuela, where the Spanish immigrant [[Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Boves]] formed a powerful, though irregular, royalist army out of the ''[[Llanero]]s'', mixed-race slave and plains people, by attacking the white landowning class. Boves and his followers often disregarded the command of Spanish officials and were not concerned with actually re-establishing the toppled royal government, choosing instead to keep real power among themselves. Finally, in the back country of [[Upper Peru]], the ''[[republiqueta]]s'' kept the idea of independence alive by allying with disenfranchised members of rural society and native groups, but were never able to take the major population centers.\n\nIncreasingly violent confrontations developed between Spaniards and Spanish Americans, but this tension was often related to class issues or fomented by patriot leaders to create a new sense of nationalism. After being incited to rid the country of the ''gachupines'' (a disparaging term for ''Peninsulares''), Hidalgo's forces indiscriminately massacred hundreds of Criollos and ''Peninsulares'' who had taken refuge at the [[Alh\u00f3ndiga de Granaditas]] in Guanajuato. In Venezuela during his [[Admirable Campaign]], [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] instituted a policy of a [[Decree of War to the Death|war to the death]], in which royalist Spanish Americans would be purposely spared but even neutral ''Peninsulares'' would be killed, in order to drive a wedge between the two groups. This policy laid the ground for the violent royalist reaction under Boves. Often though, royalism or patriotism simply provided a banner to organize the aggrieved, and the political causes could be discarded just as quickly as they were picked up. The Venezuelan ''Llaneros'' switched to the patriot banner once the elites and the urban centers became securely royalist after 1815, and it was the royal army in Mexico that ultimately brought about that nation's independence.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 118\u2013121, 197\u2013198, 200, 204\u2013207, 306\u2013313.

In areas where royalists controlled the main population centers, most of the fighting by those seeking independence was done by isolated [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla bands]]. In New Spain, the two main guerrilla groups were led by [[Guadalupe Victoria]] in Puebla and [[Vicente Guerrero]] in Oaxaca. In northern South America, New Granadan and Venezuelan patriots, under leaders such as [[Military career of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], [[Santiago Mari\u00f1o]], [[Manuel Piar]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez]], carried out campaigns in the vast [[Orinoco|Orinoco River basin]] and along the Caribbean coast, often with material aid coming from [[Cura\u00e7ao]] and [[Haiti]].  Also, as mentioned above, in Upper Peru, guerrilla bands controlled the isolated, rural parts of the country.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 168, 184, Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 70, 97.</ref>\n\n====Restoration of Ferdinand VII====\n\nIn March 1814, following with the collapse of the [[First French Empire]], Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlantic\u2014the myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codes\u2014had been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from [[conservatism|conservatives]] in the general population and the hierarchy of the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Spain#19th century|Spanish Catholic Church]]; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took [[History of transport|goods and people to travel]] from Spain.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 169\u2013172. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 56\u201357.</ref>\n\nFerdinand's actions constituted a definitive de facto break both with the autonomous governments, which had not yet declared formal independence, and with the effort of Spanish liberals to create a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions. Such a government was seen as an alternative to independence by many in New Spain, Central America, the Caribbean, Quito, Peru, Upper Peru and Chile. Yet the news of the restoration of the \"[[Ancien R\u00e9gime|ancien r\u00e9gime]]\" did not initiate a new wave of juntas, as had happened in 1809 and 1810, with the notable exception of the establishment of a junta in [[Cusco|Cuzco]] demanding the implementation of the Spanish Constitution. Instead most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided to wait and see what would come out of the restoration of normalcy. In fact, in areas of New Spain, Central America and Quito, governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional ''[[Cabildo (council)|ayuntamientos]]'' in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 336. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 106.</ref> Liberals on both sides of the Atlantic, nevertheless, continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy, ultimately succeeding in 1820. The most dramatic example of transatlantic collaboration is perhaps [[Francisco Javier Mina]]'s expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 162. 171\u2013172, 207. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 173\u2013175, 192\u2013194</ref>\n\nSpanish Americans in royalist areas who were committed to independence had already joined the guerrilla movements. However, Ferdinand's actions did set areas outside of the control of the crown on the path to full independence. The governments of these regions, which had their origins in the juntas of 1810, and even moderates there, who had entertained a reconciliation with the crown, now saw the need to separate from Spain if they were to protect the reforms they had enacted.\n\n====Royalist military====\n{{Main|Spanish expeditionary army (Spanish American independence) order of battle}}\n[[File:Batalla-Rancagua.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Rancagua]] in 1814]]\n\nDuring this period, royalist forces made advances into New Granada, which they controlled from 1815 to 1819, and into Chile, which they controlled from 1814 to 1817. Except for royalist areas in the northeast and south, the provinces of New Granada had maintained independence from Spain since 1810, unlike neighboring Venezuela, where royalists and pro-independence forces had exchanged control of the region several times. To pacify Venezuela and to retake New Granada, Spain organized in 1815 the largest armed force it ever sent to the New World, consisting of 10,500 troops and nearly sixty ships.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 209. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 122. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 57.</ref><ref>Small contingents from Spain had been arriving in the Americas since 1810.  On August 25, 1810, a group of [[Spanish Navy Marines|Spanish Marines]] arrived in [[Veracruz]] from [[C\u00e1diz]] on the [[frigate]], ''Nuestra se\u00f1ora de Atocha'' under the command of [[Rosendo Porlier y Asteguieta|Rosendo Porlier]] and accompanying Viceroy [[Francisco Javier Venegas]].  These were the first Spaniards to have come from Europe in support of [[royalist]]s. Frieyro de Lara. ''Guerra ej\u00e9rcito y sociedad en el nacimiento de la Espa\u00f1a contempor\u00e1nea''. (2009, Universidad de Granada) p. 660.</ref> (See, [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada]].) Although this force was crucial in retaking a solidly pro-independence region like New Granada, its soldiers were eventually spread out throughout Venezuela, New Granada, Quito, and Peru and were lost to tropical diseases, diluting their impact on the war.<ref>Rebecca Earle, \"'A Grave for Europeans'? Disease, Death, and the Spanish-American Revolutions\" in Christon I. Archer, ed. ''The Wars of Independence in Spanish America'', 283\u2013297.</ref> More importantly, the majority of the royalist forces were composed, not of soldiers sent from the peninsula, but of Spanish Americans.\n\nOverall, Europeans formed only about a tenth of the royalist armies in Spanish America, and only about half of the expeditionary units, once they were deployed in the Americas. Since each European soldier casualty was replaced by a Spanish American soldier, over time, there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units. For example, [[Pablo Morillo]], commander in chief of the expeditionary force sent to South America, reported that he had only 2,000 European soldiers under his command in 1820; in other words, only half the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European. It is estimated that in the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]] only a quarter of the royalist forces were European soldiers, in the [[Battle of Carabobo]] about a fifth, and in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] less than 1% was European.\n\nThe American militias reflected the racial make-up of the local population. For example, in 1820 the royalist army in Venezuela had 843 white (''espa\u00f1ol''), 5,378 [[Casta]] and 980 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] soldiers.\n[[File:Royalist Hispanic American.png|thumb|600px|center|Royalist army]]\n\n====Pro-independence advances====\n{{Main|Crossing of the Andes|Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada}}\n\nTowards the end of this period the pro-independence forces made two important advances. In the [[Southern Cone]], a veteran of the Spanish army with experience in the Peninsular War, [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], became the governor of the [[Province of Cuyo]]. He used this position to begin organizing an army as early as 1814 in preparation for an invasion of Chile. This was an important change in strategy after [[Army of the North|three United Provinces campaigns]] had been defeated in [[Upper Peru]]. San Mart\u00edn's army became the nucleus of the [[Army of the Andes]], which received crucial political and material support in 1816 when [[Juan Mart\u00edn de Pueyrred\u00f3n]] became [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Supreme Director]] of the [[United Provinces of South America|United Provinces]]. In January 1817, San Mart\u00edn was finally ready to advance against the royalists in Chile. Ignoring an injunction from the congress of the R\u00edo de la Plata not to move against Chile, San Mart\u00edn together with General [[Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme]], later Supreme Director of Chile, led the Army over the Andes in a move that turned the tables on the royalists. By February 10, San Mart\u00edn had control of northern and central Chile, and a year later, after a [[Guerra a muerte|war with no quarter]], the south. With the aid of a fleet under the command of former British naval officer [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]], Chile was secured from royalist control and independence was declared that year. San Mart\u00edn and his allies spent the next two years planning an invasion of Peru, which began in 1820.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 138\u2013141. Rodr\u00edguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 179\u2013182. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 72\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn northern South America, after several failed campaigns to take Caracas and other urban centers of Venezuela, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] devised a similar plan in 1819 to cross the Andes and liberate New Granada from the royalists. Like San Mart\u00edn, Bol\u00edvar personally undertook the efforts to create an army to invade a neighboring country, collaborated with pro-independence exiles from that region, and lacked the approval of the [[Congress of Angostura|Venezuelan congress]]. Unlike San Mart\u00edn, however, Bol\u00edvar did not have a professionally trained army, but rather a quickly assembled mix of ''Llanero'' guerrillas, New Granadan exiles led by Santander and [[British Legions|British recruits]]. From June to July 1819, using the [[Wet season|rainy season]] as cover, Bol\u00edvar led his army across the flooded plains and over the cold, forbidding passes of the Andes, with heavy losses\u2014a quarter of the British Legion perished, as well as many of his ''Llanero'' soldiers, who were not prepared for the nearly 4,000-meter altitudes\u2014but the gamble paid off. By August Bol\u00edvar was in control of [[Bogot\u00e1]] and its treasury, and gained the support of many in New Granada, which still resented the harsh reconquest carried out under Morillo. Nevertheless, Santander found it necessary to continue the policy of the \"war to the death\" and carried out the execution of thirty-eight royalist officers who had surrendered. With the resources of New Granada, Bol\u00edvar became the undisputed leader of the patriots in Venezuela and orchestrated the union of the two regions in a new state called [[Gran Colombia|Colombia (Gran Colombia)]].<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 209\u2013218. {{cite book | last = MacKenzie| first = S.

This force, however, never left Spain. Instead, it became the means by which liberals were finally able to reinstate a constitutional regime. On January 1, 1820, [[Rafael del Riego|Rafael Riego]], commander of the Asturias Battalion, headed a rebellion among the troops, demanding the return of the 1812 Constitution. His troops marched through the cities of [[Andalusia]] with the hope of extending the uprising to the civilian population, but locals were mostly indifferent. An uprising, however, did occur in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in northern Spain, and from there it quickly spread throughout the country.

Militarily, the large numbers of reinforcements, which were especially needed to retake New Granada and defend the Viceroyalty of Peru, would never arrive. Furthermore, as the royalists' situation became more desperate in region after region, the army experienced wholesale defections of units to the patriot side. Politically, the reinstitution of a liberal regime changed the terms under which the Spanish government sought to engage the insurgents. The new government naively assumed that the insurgents were fighting for Spanish liberalism and that the Spanish Constitution could still be the basis of reconciliation between the two sides. The government implemented the Constitution and held elections in the overseas provinces, just as in Spain. It also ordered military commanders to begin armistice negotiations with the insurgents with the promise that they could participate in the restored representative government.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 335\u2013340.

Elections were held, local governments formed and [[Deputy (legislator)|deputies]] sent to the Cortes. The Spanish Constitution of 1812 could have been an opportunity to enact social change slowly and without the threat of a radicalized uprising from the lower social classes by offering an opportunity to enact change that those in power would believe would best benefit their respective territories.<ref name=\":0\" /> Among liberals, however, there was fear that the new regime would not last; and conservatives and the Church worried that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti-clerical legislation. Yet, because the Cortes of Cadiz was located in Spain, political and economic power and decisions were localized in Spain, effectively giving them control over all of colonial Latin America.<ref name=\":0\" /> These tensions further frustrated many Spanish-Americans because of their inability to control the politics that directly affected their economic and sociopolitical wellbeing, further leading them towards independence.<ref name=\":0\" /> This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance.

The simple terms that Iturbide proposed became the basis of the [[Plan of Iguala]]: the independence of New Spain (now to be called the Mexican Empire) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state religion and the protection of its [[Fuero|existing privileges]]; and the equality of all New Spaniards, whether immigrants or native-born. The following month the other important guerrilla leader, [[Guadalupe Victoria]], joined the alliance, and on March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new [[Army of the Three Guarantees]]. The representative of the new Spanish government, Superior Political Chief [[Juan O'Donoj\u00fa]], who replaced the previous viceroys, arrived in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] on July 1, 1821, but he found that royalists held the entire country except for Veracruz, Mexico City and [[Acapulco]]. Since at the time that O'Donoj\u00fa had left Spain, the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions, O'Donoj\u00fa proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala. The resulting [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]], which was signed on August 24, kept all existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, in force until a new constitution for Mexico could be written. O'Donoj\u00fa became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8. Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba, and the final break with the mother country came on May 19, 1822, when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on Iturbide.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 320\u2013323.

On September 15, 1821, an [[Act of Independence of Central America|Act of Independence]] was signed in Guatemala City which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported the terms of the Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 333\u2013340.

[[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] inadvertently led a continent-wide [[pincer movement]] from southern and northern South America that liberated most of the [[Hispanic America|Spanish American nations]] on that continent. After securing the [[Chilean War of Independence|independence of Chile]] in 1818, San Mart\u00edn concentrated on building a naval fleet in the Pacific to counter [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] control of those waters and reach the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist stronghold]] of [[Lima]]. By mid-1820 San Mart\u00edn had assembled a fleet of eight warships and sixteen transport ships under the command of Admiral Cochrane. The fleet set sail from [[Valpara\u00edso]] to [[Paracas Bay|Paracas]] in southern [[Peru]]. On September 7, the army landed at Paracas and successfully took [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]]. After this, San Mart\u00edn, waiting for a generalized Peruvian revolt, chose to avoid direct military confrontation. San Mart\u00edn hoped that his presence would initiate an authentic [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peruvian revolt]] against Spanish rule, believing that otherwise any liberation would be ephemeral. In the meantime, San Mart\u00edn engaged in diplomacy with Viceroy [[Joaqu\u00edn de la Pezuela]], who was under orders from the constitutional government to negotiate on the basis of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]] and to maintain the unity of the [[Spanish Crown|Spanish Monarchy]]. However, these efforts proved fruitless, since independence and unity of the monarchy could not be reconciled, so the army sailed in late October to a better strategic position in [[Huacho]], in northern Peru. During the next few months, successful land and naval campaigns against the royalists secured the new foothold, and it was at Huacho that San Mart\u00edn learned that [[Guayaquil]] (in [[Ecuador]]) had declared independence on October 9.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 172\u2013178.

Bol\u00edvar was aided by Spain's new policy of seeking engagement with the insurgents, which Morillo implemented, renouncing to the command in chief, and returning to Spain. Although Bol\u00edvar rejected the Spanish proposal that the patriots rejoin Spain under the Spanish Constitution, the two sides established a six-month [[Ceasefire|truce]] and the regularization of the [[rules of engagement]] under the [[Jus gentium|law of nations]] on November 25 and 26. The truce did not last six months. It was apparent to all that the royalist cause had been greatly weakened by the lack of reinforcements. Royalist soldiers and whole units began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers. On January 28, 1821, the ''[[cabildo (council)|ayuntamiento]]'' of [[Maracaibo]] declared the province an independent republic that chose to join the new [[nation-state]] of [[Gran Colombia]]. [[Miguel de la Torre]], who had replaced Morillo as head of the army, took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed when Bol\u00edvar returned there in April leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on June 24, the Gran Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela save for [[Puerto Cabello]] and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Bol\u00edvar could now concentrate on Gran Colombia's claims to southern New Granada and Quito.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 218\u2013219.

During the next few months [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|San Mart\u00edn]] once again engaged in negotiations, offering the creation of an independent monarchy; but La Serna insisted on the unity of the Spanish monarchy, so the negotiations came to nothing. By July La Serna judged his hold on Lima to be weak, and on July 8 the royal army abandoned the coastal city in order to reinforce positions in the highlands, with [[Cusco|Cuzco]] as new capital of the viceroyalty. On the 12th [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|San Mart\u00edn]] entered Lima, where he was declared \"Protector of the Country\" on July 28, an office which allowed him to rule the newly independent state.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 178\u2013179.

For a year Sucre was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides, exhausted, signed a ninety-day armistice. The following year, at the [[Battle of Pichincha]] on May 24, 1822, Sucre's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito; Gran Colombia's hold on the territory was secure. The following year, after a Peruvian patriot army was destroyed in the [[Battle of Ica]], San Mart\u00edn met with Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar in [[Guayaquil]] on July 26 and 27. Thereafter San Mart\u00edn decided to retire from the scene. For the next two years, two armies of ''Rioplatense'' (Argentinian), Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian patriots were destroyed trying to penetrate the royalist bastion in the [[Andean]] regions of Peru and [[Upper Peru]]. A year later a Peruvian congress resolved to make Bol\u00edvar head of the patriot forces in the country. An internecine conflict between La Serna and General Pedro Antonio Ola\u00f1eta, which was an extension of the [[Trienio Liberal|Liberal Triennium]], proved to be the royalists' undoing.

La Serna's army was numerically superior but consisted of mostly new recruits. The only significant royalist area remaining on the continent was the highland country of [[Upper Peru]]. Following the Battle of Ayacucho, the royalist troops of Upper Peru under the command of Ola\u00f1eta surrendered after he died in [[Nor Chichas Province|Tumusla]] on April 2, 1825. Bol\u00edvar tended to favor maintaining the unity of Upper Peru with Peru, but the Upper Peruvian leaders\u2014many former royalists, like Casimiro Ola\u00f1eta, nephew of General Ola\u00f1eta\u2014gathered in a congress under Sucre's auspices supported the country's independence.

Early, in 1822, the United States recognized [[Chile]], the [[United Provinces of South America|United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], Peru, [[Gran Colombia]], and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and R\u00edo de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years.<ref>Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 105\u2013106.</ref>\n\n====Last royalist bastions====\n[[File:Batalla de Pueblo Viejo.jpg|thumb|300px|Spain fails to reconquer Mexico at the [[Isidro Barradas|Battle of Tampico]] in 1829]]\n\nThe Spanish coastal fortifications in [[Veracruz]], [[Callao]] and [[Chilo\u00e9]] were the footholds that resisted until 1825 and 1826 respectively. In the following decade, royalist guerrillas continued to operate in several countries and Spain launched a few attempts to retake parts of the Spanish American mainland. In 1827 Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Arizabalo]] started an irregular war with Venezuelan guerrillas, and Brigadier [[Isidro Barradas]] led the last attempt with regular troops to reconquer Mexico in 1829. The [[Pincheira brothers]] moved to Patagonia and remained there as royalist outlaws until defeated in 1832. But efforts like these did not reverse the new political situation.\n\nThe increasing irrelevance of the [[Holy Alliance]] after 1825 and the fall of the Bourbon dynasty in France in 1830 during the [[July Revolution]] eliminated the principal support of Ferdinand VII in Europe, but it was not until the king's death in 1833 that Spain finally abandoned all plans of military reconquest, and in 1836 its government went so far as to renounce sovereignty over all of continental America. During the course of the 19th century, Spain would recognize each of the new states.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OxcpEbVzMpQC Costeloe, Michael P.

Independence destroyed the de facto [[trade bloc]] that was the Spanish Empire - [[Manila galleon]]s and [[Spanish treasure fleet]]s in particular. After independence, trade ''among'' the new Spanish American nations was less than it had been in the colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to expediency, protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-[[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 344\u2013347.

Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 347\u2013351.

In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free-womb laws and programs for [[compensated emancipation]]. By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 347\u2013349.</ref>\n\n===Role of women===\n[[File:Juana Azurduy.jpg|thumb|[[Juana Azurduy de Padilla]], a [[Mestizo|Mestiza]] leader of independence in Rio de la Plata.]]\n\nWomen were not simply spectators throughout the Independence Wars of Latin America. Many women took sides on political issues and joined independence movements in order to participate on many different levels. Women could not help but act as caring relatives either as mother, sister, wives or daughters of the men who were fighting. Women created political organizations and organized meetings and groups to donate food and supplies to the soldiers.\n\nSome women supported the wars as spies, informants and combatants. [[Manuela S\u00e1enz]] was a long term lover of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] and acted as his spy and confidante and was secretary of his archive. She saved his life on two occasions, nursed wounded soldiers and has even been believed some historians to have fought in a few battles. S\u00e1enz followed Bol\u00edvar and his army through the independence wars and became to be known in Latin America as the \u201cmother of feminism and women's emancipation and equal rights.\u201d\nBol\u00edvar himself was a supporter of women's rights and suffrage in Latin America. It was Bol\u00edvar who allowed for S\u00e1enz to become the great pioneer of women's freedom. He wanted to set the women of Latin America free from the oppression and inferiority of what the Spanish regime had established.  Bol\u00edvar even made S\u00e1enz a Colonel of the Colombian Army due to her heroics which caused controversy because there were no women in the army at the time. Another woman who gained prominence in the fight for independence was [[Juana Azurduy de Padilla]], a mixed-race woman who fought for independence in the R\u00edo de la Plata region. Argentine President [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] posthumously promoted her to the rank of general.<ref>The Argentine President promotes Juana Azurduy to General in the Argentine Army.www.szmm.gov.hu/download.php?ctag=download&docID=14380</ref>\n\nAccording to gender stereotypes, women were not meant to be soldiers; only men were supposed to engage in fighting and conflict. There were still plenty of women present on the battlefields to help rescue and nurse soldiers. Some women fought alongside their husbands and sons on the battlefield. The majority of women assumed supportive and non-competitive roles such as fundraising and caring for the sick. Revolution for women meant something different than for men. Women saw revolution as a way to earn equal rights, such as voting, and to overcome the suppression of subordination of women to men.\nWomen were usually identified as victims during the independence wars since the women of Latin America were forced to sacrifice for the cause. The ideals of womanhood meant that women must sacrifice what the situation required such as a mother sacrificing her son or a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or marriage due to the loss of many young men. This view meant that women were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics in the hands of the men.<ref>\u201d O\u2019Connor, Mothers Making Latin America\u201d, 26-27.</ref>\n\n===Government and politics===\n{{see also|Treaties to recognise the Spanish American independence}}\n[[File:Spanish Empire - 1824.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Map of territories that became independent during those wars (blue)]]\nIndependence also did not result in stable political regimes, save in a few countries. First, the new nations did not have well-defined identities, but rather the process of creating identities was only beginning. This would be carried out through newspapers and the creation of national symbols, including new names for the countries (\"Mexico\", \"Colombia\", \"Ecuador\", \"Bolivia\", \"Argentina\"), that broke with the past.

The Catholic Church, which had been an important social and political institution during the colonial period, initially came out weakened by the end of the conflicts. As with government officials, many ''Peninsular'' bishops abandoned their dioceses and their posts were not filled for decades until new prelates could be created and relations between the new nations and the [[Pope|Vatican]] were regularized. Then as the Church recovered, its economic and political power was attacked by liberals.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 351\u2013352.

The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the [[caudillo]]s, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.<ref>Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 341\u2013342, 352\u2013355.
