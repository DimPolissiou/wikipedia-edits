This accomplishment was later also achieved by [[Alison Nicholas]], [[Pak Se-ri]], [[Karrie Webb]], [[Inbee Park]] and [[Ariya Jutanugarn]].

A drunken man who cannot pay his tab trades: he decides to sell his ticket to the waiter, Naamdev ([[Pran (actor)|Pran]]). Namdev purchases this ticket with his three friends Damu ([[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]]), Raghu ([[Kader Khan]]) and Jaggi ([[Jagdish Raj]]). Using a system of drawing out the highest card to decide who keeps the ticket, Jaggi wins, and the ticket stays with him. When the ticket turns out to be a winner, Damu and Raghu turn on the other two, murdering Jaggi and framing Namdev. Namdev goes on the run, but Raghu and Damu intervene and throw him over a bridge into a river. Namdev is presumed dead.\n\nHowever, he is rescued by Don ([[Amrish Puri]]), and no one is aware he is alive.\n\nTwenty years later, Damu and Raghu have used their stolen lottery money to build a fabulous hotel and make millions, becoming very successful businessmen. Damu has used a share of his money to send his youngest son, Vicky ([[Shatrughan Sinha]]), to school in England. They have even employed Namdev's oldest son Johnny ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), Vicky's best friend, as a waiter in the hotel. By coincidence (or by fate!) Johnny and Vicky fall in love with the same beautiful singer, Miss Asha ([[Hema Malini]]). Julie ([[Reena Roy]]) is a childhood friend of Vicky's who is in love with him, but he only sees her as a friend. When Johnny discovers this, he and Julie sacrifice their own love to ensure that Vicky and Asha get together. At the same time, Johnny's younger brother Sunny ([[Rishi Kapoor]]) has fallen for Asha's younger sister, Kim ([[Kim Yashpal]]). Kim and Asha happen to be the daughters of Jaggi, the man Namdev supposedly murdered. Namdev returns soon after and plans to take revenge against Damu and Raghu for separating him from his sons Johnny and Sunny. The lives of all these characters become intertwined and ''[[Naseeb (1981 film)|Naseeb]]'' becomes a poignant story about love, friendship, sacrifice, deceit, revenge and, above all, destiny.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as John Jani Janardan (Johnny)\n*[[Shatrughan Sinha]] as Vikram (Vicky)\n*[[Rishi Kapoor]] as Sunny\n*[[Hema Malini]] as Asha\n*[[Reena Roy]] as Julie\n*[[Kim Yashpal|Kim]] as Kim\n*[[Pran (actor)|Pran]] as Naamdev (Waiter)\n*[[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]] as Damodar 'Damu' (Photographer)\n*[[Kader Khan]] as Raghuvir 'Raghu' (Tangerwala)\n*[[Prem Chopra]] as (Raghu's Elder Son)\n*[[Shakti Kapoor]] as Ashok (Raghu's Younger Son)\n*[[Amrish Puri]] as Don\n*[[Lalita Pawar]] as Mrs. Gomes (Julie's Mother)\n*[[Yusuf Khan (actor)|Yusuf Khan]] as Zabisco (Don's Son)\n*[[Jagdish Raj]] as Jaggi (Asha & Kim's Father) (Band Musician)\n*[[Om Shivpuri]] as K.K.\n*[[Mukri]] as Mehboob Bhai\n*[[Shubha Khote]] as Ms. Prema (School Principal)\n*[[Jeevan]] as Professor Prem (School Principal)\n*[[Viju Khote]] as Rodricks\n*[[Manik Irani]] as Fighter\n*[[Asrani]] as Himself (Shooting Advert with Asha)\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\nAll the songs were composed by [[Laxmikant Pyarelal]] and the lyrics were penned by [[Anand Bakshi]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Song\n!Singer\n|-\n|\"Zindagi Imtihan Leti Hai\"\n|[[Anwar (singer)|Anwar]], [[Suman Kalyanpur]], [[Dr. Kamlesh Avasthi]]\n|-\n|\"Pakdo Pakdo Pakdo\"\n|[[Kishore Kumar]], [[Usha Mangeshkar]]\n|-\n|\"Mere Naseeb Mein Tu Hai Ke Nahin\"\n|[[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n|-\n|\"John Johnny Janardan\"\n|[[Mohammed Rafi]]\n|-\n|\"Chal Mere Bhai\"\n|[[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Rishi Kapoor]]\n|-\n|\"Rang Jamaake Jayenge\"\n|[[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Kishore Kumar]], [[Shailendra Singh (singer)|Shailendra Singh]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Asha Bhosle]], [[Usha Mangeshkar]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Cameo appearances==\nOne of the songs in the film sung by [[Mohammed Rafi]], \"John Johny Janardan\", has cameo appearances by many actors playing themselves.

A drunken man who cannot pay his tab trades: he decides to sell his ticket to the waiter, Naamdev ([[Pran]]). Namdev purchases this ticket with his three friends Damu ([[Amjad Khan]]), Raghu ([[Kader Khan]]) and Jaggi ([[Jagdish Raj]]). Using a system of drawing out the highest card to decide who keeps the ticket, Jaggi wins, and the ticket stays with him. When the ticket turns out to be a winner, Damu and Raghu turn on the other two, murdering Jaggi and framing Namdev. Namdev goes on the run, but Raghu and Damu intervene and throw him over a bridge into a river. Namdev is presumed dead.\n\nHowever, he is rescued by Don ([[Amrish Puri]]), and no one is aware he is alive.\n\nTwenty years later, Damu and Raghu have used their stolen lottery money to build a fabulous hotel and make millions, becoming very successful businessmen. Damu has used a share of his money to send his youngest son, Vicky ([[Shatrughan Sinha]]), to school in England. They have even employed Namdev's oldest son Johnny ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), Vicky's best friend, as a waiter in the hotel. By coincidence (or by fate!) Johnny and Vicky fall in love with the same beautiful singer, Miss Asha ([[Hema Malini]]). Julie ([[Reena Roy]]) is a childhood friend of Vicky's who is in love with him, but he only sees her as a friend. When Johnny discovers this, he and Julie sacrifice their own love to ensure that Vicky and Asha get together. At the same time, Johnny's younger brother Sunny ([[Rishi Kapoor]]) has fallen for Asha's younger sister, Kim ([[Kim Yashpal]]). Kim and Asha happen to be the daughters of Jaggi, the man Namdev supposedly murdered. Namdev returns soon after and plans to take revenge against Damu and Raghu for separating him from his sons Johnny and Sunny. The lives of all these characters become intertwined and ''[[Naseeb]]'' becomes a poignant story about love, friendship, sacrifice, deceit, revenge and, above all, destiny.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as John Jani Janardan (Johnny)\n*[[Shatrughan Sinha]] as Vikram (Vicky)\n*[[Rishi Kapoor]] as Sunny\n*[[Hema Malini]] as Asha\n*[[Reena Roy]] as Julie\n*[[Kim Yashpal|Kim]] as Kim\n*[[Pran (actor)|Pran]] as Naamdev (Waiter)\n*[[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]] as Damodar 'Damu' (Photographer)\n*[[Kader Khan]] as Raghuvir 'Raghu' (Tangerwala)\n*[[Prem Chopra]] as (Raghu's Elder Son)\n*[[Shakti Kapoor]] as Ashok (Raghu's Younger Son)\n*[[Amrish Puri]] as Don\n*[[Lalita Pawar]] as Mrs. Gomes (Julie's Mother)\n*[[Yusuf Khan (actor)|Yusuf Khan]] as Zabisco (Don's Son)\n*[[Jagdish Raj]] as Jaggi (Asha & Kim's Father) (Band Musician)\n*[[Om Shivpuri]] as K.K.\n*[[Mukri]] as Mehboob Bhai\n*[[Shubha Khote]] as Ms. Prema (School Principal)\n*[[Jeevan]] as Professor Prem (School Principal)\n*[[Viju Khote]] as Rodricks\n*[[Manik Irani]] as Fighter\n*[[Asrani]] as Himself (Shooting Advert with Asha)\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\nAll the songs were composed by [[Laxmikant Pyarelal]] and the lyrics were penned by [[Anand Bakshi]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Song\n!Singer\n|-\n|\"Zindagi Imtihan Leti Hai\"\n|[[Anwar]], [[Suman Kalyanpur]], [[Dr. Kamlesh Avasthi]]\n|-\n|\"Pakdo Pakdo Pakdo\"\n|[[Kishore Kumar]], [[Usha Mangeshkar]]\n|-\n|\"Mere Naseeb Mein Tu Hai Ke Nahin\"\n|[[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n|-\n|\"John Johnny Janardan\"\n|[[Mohammed Rafi]]\n|-\n|\"Chal Mere Bhai\"\n|[[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Rishi Kapoor]]\n|-\n|\"Rang Jamaake Jayenge\"\n|[[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Kishore Kumar]], [[Shailendra Singh (singer)|Shailendra Singh]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Asha Bhosle]], [[Usha Mangeshkar]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Cameo appearances==\nOne of the songs in the film sung by [[Mohammed Rafi]], \"John Johny Janardan\", has cameo appearances by many actors playing themselves.

In the story, Juan Cortilla, a Mexican bandit played by [[Joe De Santis]], is stormed from jail. Chamberlain, as United States Army Lieutenant Winslow, asks Grey Holden (lead series character played by [[Darren McGavin]]) to transport Cortilla and his men to a military garrison. Instead, Cortilla takes over Holden's vessel and its gunpowder.

''Dr. Kildare'' ended in 1966, after which Chamberlain began performing on the theatre circuit.

He specialized in [[crime fiction]], especially [[Caper story|comic capers]], with an occasional foray into [[science fiction]] and other genres. Westlake is perhaps best-remembered for creating two professional criminal characters who each starred in a long-running series: the relentless, hard-boiled [[Parker (Stark novels character)|Parker]] (published under the pen name Richard Stark), and [[John Dortmunder]] who featured in a more humorous series.\n\nHe was a three-time [[Edgar Award]] winner, and alongside [[Joe Gores]] and [[William L. DeAndrea]] was one of few writers to win Edgars in three different categories (1968, Best Novel, ''God Save the Mark''; 1990, Best Short Story, \"Too Many Crooks\"; 1991, Best Motion Picture Screenplay, ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]''). In 1993, the [[Mystery Writers of America]] named Westlake a [[Mystery Writers of America#Grand Master Award|Grand Master]], the highest honor bestowed by the society.\n\n==Personal life==\nWestlake was born in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], New York, the son of Lillian (Bounds) and Albert Joseph Westlake,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://authorscalendar.info/westl.htm|website=authorscalendar.info|title=Donald E. Westlake}}</ref> and was raised in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York.\n\nWestlake wrote constantly in his teens, and after 200 rejections, his first short story sale was in 1954. Sporadic short story sales followed over the next few years, while Westlake attended [[Champlain College]] of [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]], New York (now defunct),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbmonthly.com/?p%3D1259 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 9, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606211751/http://www.sbmonthly.com/?p=1259 |archivedate=June 6, 2014 }}</ref> and [[Binghamton University]] in [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], New York. He also spent two years in the [[United States Air Force]].\n\nWestlake moved to New York City in 1959, initially to work for a literary agency while writing on the side.  By 1960, he was writing full-time.  His first novel under his own name, ''The Mercenaries'', was published in 1960; over the next 48 years, Westlake published a variety of novels and short stories under his own name and a number of pseudonyms.\n\nHe was married three times, the final time to [[Abigail Westlake]] (also known as Abby Adams Westlake and Abby Adams), a writer of nonfiction (her two published books are ''An Uncommon Scold'' and ''The Gardener's Gripe Book''). The couple moved out of New York City to [[Ancram, New York|Ancram]] in upstate New York in 1990. Abby Westlake is a well-regarded gardener, and the Westlake garden has frequently been opened for public viewing in the summer.\n\nWestlake died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on December 31, 2008, while on the way to a New Year's Eve dinner, while he and his wife were on vacation in [[Mexico]].<ref>Lee, Jennifer 8.

Before\u2026the end of 1961\u2026six other people, friends of mine, published books as Alan Marshall, with my permission but without the publishers' knowledge.\"  Two novels published in 1960 by [[Midwood Books]] were co-authored by Westlake and [[Lawrence Block]] (who used the pen-name \"Sheldon Lord\") and were credited to \"Sheldon Lord and Alan Marshall\": ''A Girl Called Honey'', dedicated to Westlake and Block, and ''So Willing'', dedicated to \"Nedra and Loretta,\" who were (at that time) Westlake and Block's wives.<ref name=\"efanzine\">http://efanzines.com/EK/eI13/index.htm#westlake</ref>\n*'''James Blue''': one-shot pseudonym, used as a third name circa 1959 when both Westlake and Stark already had stories in a magazine issue. In actuality, the name of Westlake's cat.<ref>http://www.chronogram.com/issue/2006/04/arts/books/</ref>\n* '''Ben Christopher''': one-shot pseudonym for a 1960 story in ''77 Sunset Strip'' magazine, based on the characters from the TV show.<ref name=\"thrillingdetective.com\"/>\n* '''John Dexter''': a house pseudonym used by Nightstand Books for the work of numerous authors.  The very first novel credited to John Dexter is a soft-core work by Westlake called ''No Longer A Virgin'' (1960)\n* '''Andrew Shaw''': pseudonym used by Westlake and Lawrence Block for their 1961 collaborative soft-core novel ''Sin Hellcat''.  Like John Dexter (above), \"Andrew Shaw\" was a house pseudonym used by a wide variety of authors.\n* '''Edwin West''': ''Brother and Sister, Campus Doll, Young and Innocent'', all 1961; ''Strange Affair'', 1962; ''Campus Lovers'', 1963,<ref name=\"biblio\"/> one 1966 short story.<ref name=\"thrillingdetective.com\"/>\n* '''John B. Allan''': ''Elizabeth Taylor: A Fascinating Story of America's Most Talented Actress and the World's Most Beautiful Woman'', 1961, biography.<ref name=\"biblio\"/>\n* '''Don Holliday''': pseudonym used by Westlake for two collaborative soft-core novels (with various authors, including [[Hal Dresner]] and Lawrence Block) in 1963/64.<ref name=\"efanzine\"/>\n* '''Curt Clark''': debuted in 1964 with the short story \"Nackles\".  Novel: ''Anarchaos'', 1967, science fiction.<ref name=\"biblio\"/>\n* '''Barbara Wilson''': one co-authored novel with [[Laurence Janifer]] (''The Pleasures We Know'', 1964); Janifer also used this name for at least one solo novel with no involvement from Westlake.<ref name=\"biblio\"/>\n* '''Tucker Coe''': five mystery novels featuring the character of Mitch Tobin: ''Kinds of Love, Kinds of Death'', 1966; ''Murder Among Children'', 1967; ''Wax Apple'' and ''A Jade in Aries'', both 1970; ''Don't Lie to Me'', 1972.<ref name=\"biblio\"/>\n* '''P. N. Castor''': pseudonym used for one 1966 short story co-authored with Dave Foley.<ref name=\"thrillingdetective.com\"/>\n* '''Timothy J. Culver''': ''Ex Officio'', 1970, thriller.<ref name=\"biblio\"/>\n* '''J. Morgan Cunningham''': ''Comfort Station'', 1971, humor.  Cover features the [[blurb]], \"I wish I had written this book! &ndash;  Donald E. Westlake.\"<ref name=\"biblio\"/>\n* '''Samuel Holt''': four mystery novels featuring the character of Sam Holt, 1986-1989: ''One of Us is Wrong'' and ''I Know a Trick Worth Two of That'', both 1986; ''What I Tell You Three Times is False'', 1987; ''The Fourth Dimension is Death'', 1989.<ref name=\"biblio\"/> Westlake used the Holt pseudonym as an experiment to see if he could succeed as an author under a new name; he was dismayed when his publisher revealed the true identity of \"Holt\" simultaneously with the release of the first book.  Westlake subsequently delivered all four books he had contracted for as Holt, but abandoned plans to write at least two further books in the series.\n* '''Judson Jack Carmichael''': ''The Scared Stiff'', 2002, mystery; UK editions dropped the pseudonym.\n\nWestlake sometimes made playful use of his pseudonyms in his work:\n* [[John Dortmunder]] and associates plan a kidnapping based on a mythical Richard Stark/Parker novel in Westlake's ''Jimmy The Kid''.  Stark himself makes an appearance in the novel.\n* Richard Stark's character of Parker has ID that gives his name as \"John B. Allan\".\n* In the film version of ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'' (for which Westlake wrote the screenplay) a key scene takes place at the firm of Stark, Coe and Fellows. Westlake explains the in-joke in the film's DVD commentary track, noting that he wrote books as \"Richard Stark, Tucker Coe and some other fellows.\"  Westlake had been asked to write the script for ''The Grifters'' using the pen-name \"Richard Stark\" as an in-joke, but insisted on using his own name.\n* A character in Timothy J. Culver's ''Ex Officio'' works for Coe-Stark Associates.\n* In the Mitch Tobin novel ''A Jade in Aries'', Tobin phones a friend, who briefly mistakes Tobin for somebody named Don Stark.\n\nAdditionally, Westlake conducted a mock \"interview\" with Richard Stark, Tucker Coe and Timothy J. Culver in an article for the non-fiction book ''Murder Ink: The Mystery Reader's Companion''.\n\n==Writing style==\nDonald Westlake was known for the great ingenuity of his plots and the audacity of his gimmicks. His writing and dialogue are lively. His main characters are fully rounded, believable, and clever. Westlake's most famous characters include the hard-boiled criminal [[Parker (Stark novels character)|Parker]] (appearing in fiction under the Richard Stark pseudonym) and Parker's comic flip-side [[John Dortmunder]]. Westlake was quoted as saying that he originally intended what became ''The Hot Rock'' to be a straightforward Parker novel, but \"It kept turning funny,\" and thus became the first John Dortmunder novel.\n\nMost of Donald Westlake's novels are set in [[New York City]]. In each of the Dortmunder novels, there is typically a detailed foray somewhere through the city.\nHe wrote just two non-fiction books: ''Under an English Heaven'', regarding the unlikely 1967 Anguillan \"revolution\", and a biography of [[Elizabeth Taylor]].<ref name=\"biblio\"/>\n\nWestlake was an occasional contributor to [[science fiction fanzines]] such as ''[[Xero (SF fanzine)|Xero]]'', and used ''Xero'' as a venue for a harsh announcement that he was leaving the [[science fiction]] field.<ref>Westlake, Donald. \"Don't Call Us, We'll Call You\" and responses by [[Frederik Pohl]], [[Donald Wollheim]], [[Harry Warner, Jr.]], [[Steve Stiles]] and others, reprinted in: Lupoff, Richard A., & Pat Lupoff. ''The Best of ''Xero''.'' Tachyon Publications, 2004, pp. 120 ''et seq.''</ref>\n\n==Motion pictures and television==\nSeveral of Westlake's novels have been made into motion pictures: 1967's ''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]'' (based on ''[[The Hunter (Stark novel)|The Hunter]]'') with [[Lee Marvin]] as Parker (changed to Walker); ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Mise \u00e0 sac|fr}}'' (based on ''The Score'') with [[Michel Constantin]] as Parker (changed to Georges), also in 1967; 1968's ''[[The Split (film)|The Split]]'' (from the book ''The Seventh'') with [[Jim Brown]] as Parker (changed to McClain); ''[[The Hot Rock (film)|The Hot Rock]]'' in 1972 with [[Robert Redford]]; ''[[Cops and Robbers (1973 film)|Cops and Robbers]]'' in 1973; ''[[The Outfit (1973 film)|''The Outfit'']]'' with [[Robert Duvall]] as Parker (changed to Macklin), also in 1973; ''[[Bank Shot]]'' in 1974 with [[George C. Scott]]; ''[[The Busy Body]]'' (with an \"all-star cast\") in 1967; ''[[Slayground]]'' with [[Peter Coyote]] as Parker (changed to Stone) in 1983; ''[[Why Me? (1990 film)|Why Me?]]'' with [[Christopher Lambert]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], and [[J. T. Walsh]] in 1990; ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]'' in 1999, the second film made from ''The Hunter'', with [[Mel Gibson]] as Parker (changed to Porter); ''[[What's the Worst That Could Happen?]]'' in 2001 with [[Martin Lawrence]] as Dortmunder (changed to Kevin Caffery); [[Costa Gavras|Constantin Costa-Gavras]] adapted ''The Ax'' for the European screen in 2005, to great critical and public acclaim&nbsp;\u2013 entitled ''[[Le Couperet]]'', the film takes place in France and Belgium rather than the novel's setting of New England; ''[[Parker (2013 film)|Parker]]'' in 2013, based on ''Flashfire'', with [[Jason Statham]] as Parker.\n\nIn his introduction to one of the short stories in ''Thieves' Dozen'', Westlake mentioned legal troubles with Hollywood over his continued use of the Dortmunder novel characters;  the movie studios attempted to assert that he had sold the rights to the characters to them permanently as a result of the Redford film.\n\nThe novel ''Jimmy the Kid'' has been adapted three times: in Italy as ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Come ti rapisco il pupo|it}}'' in 1976; in the U.S. as ''[[Jimmy the Kid]]'' in 1982, starring [[Gary Coleman]]; and in Germany as ''Jimmy the Kid'' in 1998, starring [[Herbert Knaup]].\n\nThe novel ''Two Much!'' has been adapted twice: in France as ''[[The Twin (1984 film)|Le Jumeau]]'' (''The Twin'') in 1984; and in the U.S. as ''[[Two Much]]'' in 1995, starring [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Melanie Griffith]].\n\n[[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Made in U.S.A. (1966 film)|Made in U.S.A.]]'' in 1966 was an extremely loose adaptation of ''The Jugger''. Neither the film's producer nor Godard purchased the rights to the novel, so Westlake successfully sued to prevent the film's commercial distribution in the United States.\n\nWestlake was himself a screenwriter. His script for the 1990 film ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]],'' adapted from the novel by [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]], was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award]]. (Westlake the screenwriter adapted Jim Thompson's work in a straightforward manner, but Westlake the humourist played on Thompson's name later that year in the Dortmunder novel ''Drowned Hopes'' by featuring a character named \"Tom Jimson\" who is a criminal psychopath.) Westlake also wrote the screenplay ''[[The Stepfather (1987 film)|The Stepfather]]'' (from a story by Westlake, [[Brian Garfield]] and Carolyn Lefcourt), the film of which was popular enough to inspire two sequels and a remake, projects in which Westlake was not involved.\n\nIn 1987 Westlake wrote the teleplay ''Fatal Confession'', a pilot for the TV series ''[[Father Dowling Mysteries]]'' based on the novels by [[Ralph McInerny]]. He also appeared in a small role (as the mystery writer Rich Vincent) in the third-season episode, \"The Hardboiled Mystery.\"\n\nWhile the seventeenth [[James Bond in Film|James Bond]] film ''[[GoldenEye]]'' was in post-production, Westlake  wrote story treatments for the eighteenth James Bond film (eventually titled ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'') in collaboration with Bond series writer-producer Michael G. Wilson. None of Westlake's ideas made it into the completed film, but in 1998 the author used the first treatment as the basis for a novel, ''Fall of the City.'' The existence of the novel (and its connection to the Bond treatments) was revealed in an article published in issue #32 of the magazine ''MI6 Confidential''; the article also provides a detailed analysis of the two treatments.<ref>Poggiali, Philip. \"Fall of the City: Bond 18 and Westlake\", ''MI6 Confidential'', no. 32, 2015, pp. 22\u201326.</ref> ''Fall of the City'' was published under the title ''Forever and a Death'' in June 2017 by [[Hard Case Crime]].\n\nWestlake co-wrote the story for the pilot of the ill-fated 1979 TV series ''[[Supertrain]]'' with teleplay writer [[Earl W. Wallace]]; Westlake and Wallace shared \"created by\" credit.\n\n==Works==\n===Novels===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ The following table can be sorted to show Westlake's novels in chronological order,<br />or arranged alphabetically by title, or by publisher, or by author credit, or by series.<br />\n!

He specialized in [[crime fiction]], especially [[Caper story|comic capers]], with an occasional foray into [[science fiction]] and other genres. Westlake is perhaps best-remembered for creating two professional criminal characters who each starred in a long-running series: the relentless, hard-boiled [[Parker (Stark novels character)|Parker]] (published under the pen name Richard Stark), and [[John Dortmunder]] who featured in a more humorous series.\n\nHe was a three-time [[Edgar Award]] winner, and alongside [[Joe Gores]] and [[William L. DeAndrea]] was one of few writers to win Edgars in three different categories (1968, Best Novel, ''God Save the Mark''; 1990, Best Short Story, \"Too Many Crooks\"; 1991, Best Motion Picture Screenplay, ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]''). In 1993, the [[Mystery Writers of America]] named Westlake a [[Mystery Writers of America#Grand Master Award|Grand Master]], the highest honor bestowed by the society.\n\n==Personal life==\nWestlake was born in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], New York, the son of Lillian (Bounds) and Albert Joseph Westlake,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://authorscalendar.info/westl.htm|website=authorscalendar.info|title=Donald E. Westlake}}</ref> and was raised in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York.\n\nWestlake wrote constantly in his teens, and after 200 rejections, his first short story sale was in 1954. Sporadic short story sales followed over the next few years, while Westlake attended [[Champlain College]] of [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]], New York (now defunct),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbmonthly.com/?p%3D1259 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 9, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606211751/http://www.sbmonthly.com/?p=1259 |archivedate=June 6, 2014 }}</ref> and [[Binghamton University]] in [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], New York. He also spent two years in the [[United States Air Force]].\n\nWestlake moved to New York City in 1959, initially to work for a literary agency while writing on the side.  By 1960, he was writing full-time.  His first novel under his own name, ''The Mercenaries'', was published in 1960; over the next 48 years, Westlake published a variety of novels and short stories under his own name and a number of pseudonyms.\n\nHe was married three times, the final time to [[Abigail Westlake]] (also known as Abby Adams Westlake and Abby Adams), a writer of nonfiction (her two published books are ''An Uncommon Scold'' and ''The Gardener's Gripe Book''). The couple moved out of New York City to [[Ancram, New York|Ancram]] in upstate New York in 1990. Abby Westlake is a well-regarded gardener, and the Westlake garden has frequently been opened for public viewing in the summer.\n\nWestlake died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on December 31, 2008, while on the way to a New Year's Eve dinner, while he and his wife were on vacation in [[Mexico]].<ref>Lee, Jennifer 8.

Rolfe Passer was actually the assistant editor of the magazine at the time.  It is not known why the story was published under Passer's name; frequent Westlake collaborator [[Lawrence Block]] has suggested \"editorial incompetence\".\n* '''Richard Stark''': Westlake's best-known continuing pseudonym was that of Richard Stark.  Stark debuted in 1959, with a story in ''Mystery Digest''.<ref name=\"thrillingdetective.com\">{{cite web |url=http://thrillingdetective.com/trivia/westlake.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023230154/http://www.thrillingdetective.com/trivia/westlake.html |archivedate=2008-10-23 }}</ref> Four other Stark short stories followed through 1961, including \"The Curious Facts Preceding My Execution\",<ref name=\"thrillingdetective.com\"/> later the title story in Westlake's first short-story collection.  Then, from 1962 to 1974, sixteen novels about the relentless and remorseless professional thief [[Parker (Stark novels character)|Parker]] and his accomplices (including larcenous actor [[Alan Grofield]]) appeared and were credited to Richard Stark. \"Stark\" was then inactive until 1997, when Westlake once again began writing and publishing Parker novels under Stark's name.  The University of Chicago began republishing the Richard Stark novels in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/author.epl?fullauthor%3DRichard+Stark |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826021512/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/author.epl?fullauthor=Richard%20Stark |archivedate=August 26, 2010 }}</ref>  When [[Stephen King]] wrote the novel ''[[The Dark Half]]'' in 1989, he named the central villain George Stark as an homage to Westlake.\n* '''Alan Marshall''' (or '''Alan Marsh'''):  Westlake acknowledged writing as many as 28 paperback soft-porn titles from 1959\u201364 under these names; titles include ''All My Lovers, Man Hungry, All About Annette, Sally, Virgin's Summer, Call Me Sinner, Off Limits'', and three featuring the character of Phil Crawford: ''Apprentice Virgin'', ''All the Girls Were Willing'', and ''Sin Prowl''.<ref name=\"efanzine\"/>  Westlake was not the only author to work under Marshall's name, claiming: \"The publishers would either pay more for the names they already knew or would only buy from (those) names\u2026so it became common practice for several of us to loan our names to friends\u2026. Before\u2026the end of 1961\u2026six other people, friends of mine, published books as Alan Marshall, with my permission but without the publishers' knowledge.\"  Two novels published in 1960 by [[Midwood Books]] were co-authored by Westlake and [[Lawrence Block]] (who used the pen-name \"Sheldon Lord\") and were credited to \"Sheldon Lord and Alan Marshall\": ''A Girl Called Honey'', dedicated to Westlake and Block, and ''So Willing'', dedicated to \"Nedra and Loretta,\" who were (at that time) Westlake and Block's wives.<ref name=\"efanzine\">http://efanzines.com/EK/eI13/index.htm#westlake</ref>\n*'''James Blue''': one-shot pseudonym, used as a third name circa 1959 when both Westlake and Stark already had stories in a magazine issue. In actuality, the name of Westlake's cat.<ref>http://www.chronogram.com/issue/2006/04/arts/books/</ref>\n* '''Ben Christopher''': one-shot pseudonym for a 1960 story in ''77 Sunset Strip'' magazine, based on the characters from the TV show.<ref name=\"thrillingdetective.com\"/>\n* '''John Dexter''': a house pseudonym used by Nightstand Books for the work of numerous authors.  The very first novel credited to John Dexter is a soft-core work by Westlake called ''No Longer A Virgin'' (1960)\n* '''Andrew Shaw''': pseudonym used by Westlake and Lawrence Block for their 1961 collaborative soft-core novel ''Sin Hellcat''.  Like John Dexter (above), \"Andrew Shaw\" was a house pseudonym used by a wide variety of authors.\n* '''Edwin West''': ''Brother and Sister, Campus Doll, Young and Innocent'', all 1961; ''Strange Affair'', 1962; ''Campus Lovers'', 1963,<ref name=\"biblio\"/> one 1966 short story.<ref name=\"thrillingdetective.com\"/>\n* '''John B.

Culver''': ''Ex Officio'', 1970, thriller.<ref name=\"biblio\"/>\n* '''J. Morgan Cunningham''': ''Comfort Station'', 1971, humor.  Cover features the [[blurb]], \"I wish I had written this book! &ndash;  Donald E. Westlake.\"<ref name=\"biblio\"/>\n* '''Samuel Holt''': four mystery novels featuring the character of Sam Holt, 1986-1989: ''One of Us is Wrong'' and ''I Know a Trick Worth Two of That'', both 1986; ''What I Tell You Three Times is False'', 1987; ''The Fourth Dimension is Death'', 1989.<ref name=\"biblio\"/> Westlake used the Holt pseudonym as an experiment to see if he could succeed as an author under a new name; he was dismayed when his publisher revealed the true identity of \"Holt\" simultaneously with the release of the first book.  Westlake subsequently delivered all four books he had contracted for as Holt, but abandoned plans to write at least two further books in the series.\n* '''Judson Jack Carmichael''': ''The Scared Stiff'', 2002, mystery; UK editions dropped the pseudonym.\n\nWestlake sometimes made playful use of his pseudonyms in his work:\n* [[John Dortmunder]] and associates plan a kidnapping based on a mythical Richard Stark/Parker novel in Westlake's ''Jimmy The Kid''.  Stark himself makes an appearance in the novel.\n* Richard Stark's character of Parker has ID that gives his name as \"John B. Allan\".\n* In the film version of ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'' (for which Westlake wrote the screenplay) a key scene takes place at the firm of Stark, Coe and Fellows. Westlake explains the in-joke in the film's DVD commentary track, noting that he wrote books as \"Richard Stark, Tucker Coe and some other fellows.\"  Westlake had been asked to write the script for ''The Grifters'' using the pen-name \"Richard Stark\" as an in-joke, but insisted on using his own name.\n* A character in Timothy J. Culver's ''Ex Officio'' works for Coe-Stark Associates.\n* In the Mitch Tobin novel ''A Jade in Aries'', Tobin phones a friend, who briefly mistakes Tobin for somebody named Don Stark.\n\nAdditionally, Westlake conducted a mock \"interview\" with Richard Stark, Tucker Coe and Timothy J. Culver in an article for the non-fiction book ''Murder Ink: The Mystery Reader's Companion''.\n\n==Writing style==\nDonald Westlake was known for the great ingenuity of his plots and the audacity of his gimmicks. His writing and dialogue are lively. His main characters are fully rounded, believable, and clever. Westlake's most famous characters include the hard-boiled criminal [[Parker (Stark novels character)|Parker]] (appearing in fiction under the Richard Stark pseudonym) and Parker's comic flip-side [[John Dortmunder]]. Westlake was quoted as saying that he originally intended what became ''The Hot Rock'' to be a straightforward Parker novel, but \"It kept turning funny,\" and thus became the first John Dortmunder novel.\n\nMost of Donald Westlake's novels are set in [[New York City]]. In each of the Dortmunder novels, there is typically a detailed foray somewhere through the city.\nHe wrote just two non-fiction books: ''Under an English Heaven'', regarding the unlikely 1967 Anguillan \"revolution\", and a biography of [[Elizabeth Taylor]].<ref name=\"biblio\"/>\n\nWestlake was an occasional contributor to [[science fiction fanzines]] such as ''[[Xero (SF fanzine)|Xero]]'', and used ''Xero'' as a venue for a harsh announcement that he was leaving the [[science fiction]] field.<ref>Westlake, Donald. \"Don't Call Us, We'll Call You\" and responses by [[Frederik Pohl]], [[Donald Wollheim]], [[Harry Warner, Jr.]], [[Steve Stiles]] and others, reprinted in: Lupoff, Richard A., & Pat Lupoff. ''The Best of ''Xero''.'' Tachyon Publications, 2004, pp. 120 ''et seq.''</ref>\n\n==Motion pictures and television==\nSeveral of Westlake's novels have been made into motion pictures: 1967's ''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]'' (based on ''[[The Hunter (Stark novel)|The Hunter]]'') with [[Lee Marvin]] as Parker (changed to Walker); ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Mise \u00e0 sac|fr}}'' (based on ''The Score'') with [[Michel Constantin]] as Parker (changed to Georges), also in 1967; 1968's ''[[The Split (film)|The Split]]'' (from the book ''The Seventh'') with [[Jim Brown]] as Parker (changed to McClain); ''[[The Hot Rock (film)|The Hot Rock]]'' in 1972 with [[Robert Redford]]; ''[[Cops and Robbers (1973 film)|Cops and Robbers]]'' in 1973; ''[[The Outfit (1973 film)|''The Outfit'']]'' with [[Robert Duvall]] as Parker (changed to Macklin), also in 1973; ''[[Bank Shot]]'' in 1974 with [[George C. Scott]]; ''[[The Busy Body]]'' (with an \"all-star cast\") in 1967; ''[[Slayground]]'' with [[Peter Coyote]] as Parker (changed to Stone) in 1983; ''[[Why Me? (1990 film)|Why Me?]]'' with [[Christopher Lambert]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], and [[J. T. Walsh]] in 1990; ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]'' in 1999, the second film made from ''The Hunter'', with [[Mel Gibson]] as Parker (changed to Porter); ''[[What's the Worst That Could Happen?]]'' in 2001 with [[Martin Lawrence]] as Dortmunder (changed to Kevin Caffery); [[Costa Gavras|Constantin Costa-Gavras]] adapted ''The Ax'' for the European screen in 2005, to great critical and public acclaim&nbsp;\u2013 entitled ''[[Le Couperet]]'', the film takes place in France and Belgium rather than the novel's setting of New England; ''[[Parker (2013 film)|Parker]]'' in 2013, based on ''Flashfire'', with [[Jason Statham]] as Parker.\n\nIn his introduction to one of the short stories in ''Thieves' Dozen'', Westlake mentioned legal troubles with Hollywood over his continued use of the Dortmunder novel characters;  the movie studios attempted to assert that he had sold the rights to the characters to them permanently as a result of the Redford film.\n\nThe novel ''Jimmy the Kid'' has been adapted three times: in Italy as ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Come ti rapisco il pupo|it}}'' in 1976; in the U.S. as ''[[Jimmy the Kid]]'' in 1982, starring [[Gary Coleman]]; and in Germany as ''Jimmy the Kid'' in 1998, starring [[Herbert Knaup]].\n\nThe novel ''Two Much!'' has been adapted twice: in France as ''[[The Twin (1984 film)|Le Jumeau]]'' (''The Twin'') in 1984; and in the U.S. as ''[[Two Much]]'' in 1995, starring [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Melanie Griffith]].\n\n[[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Made in U.S.A. (1966 film)|Made in U.S.A.]]'' in 1966 was an extremely loose adaptation of ''The Jugger''. Neither the film's producer nor Godard purchased the rights to the novel, so Westlake successfully sued to prevent the film's commercial distribution in the United States.\n\nWestlake was himself a screenwriter. His script for the 1990 film ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]],'' adapted from the novel by [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]], was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award]]. (Westlake the screenwriter adapted Jim Thompson's work in a straightforward manner, but Westlake the humourist played on Thompson's name later that year in the Dortmunder novel ''Drowned Hopes'' by featuring a character named \"Tom Jimson\" who is a criminal psychopath.) Westlake also wrote the screenplay ''[[The Stepfather (1987 film)|The Stepfather]]'' (from a story by Westlake, [[Brian Garfield]] and Carolyn Lefcourt), the film of which was popular enough to inspire two sequels and a remake, projects in which Westlake was not involved.\n\nIn 1987 Westlake wrote the teleplay ''Fatal Confession'', a pilot for the TV series ''[[Father Dowling Mysteries]]'' based on the novels by [[Ralph McInerny]]. He also appeared in a small role (as the mystery writer Rich Vincent) in the third-season episode, \"The Hardboiled Mystery.\"\n\nWhile the seventeenth [[James Bond in Film|James Bond]] film ''[[GoldenEye]]'' was in post-production, Westlake  wrote story treatments for the eighteenth James Bond film (eventually titled ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'') in collaboration with Bond series writer-producer Michael G. Wilson. None of Westlake's ideas made it into the completed film, but in 1998 the author used the first treatment as the basis for a novel, ''Fall of the City.'' The existence of the novel (and its connection to the Bond treatments) was revealed in an article published in issue #32 of the magazine ''MI6 Confidential''; the article also provides a detailed analysis of the two treatments.<ref>Poggiali, Philip. \"Fall of the City: Bond 18 and Westlake\", ''MI6 Confidential'', no. 32, 2015, pp. 22\u201326.</ref> ''Fall of the City'' was published under the title ''Forever and a Death'' in June 2017 by [[Hard Case Crime]].\n\nWestlake co-wrote the story for the pilot of the ill-fated 1979 TV series ''[[Supertrain]]'' with teleplay writer [[Earl W.

The original line up included [[singing|vocalist]] Carl Puttnam, [[guitarist]]/[[keyboardist]] Mike Dunphy, [[bassist]] William Potter, and [[drummer]] Steve Goodwin.\n\nIn June 1987 they recorded a [[Peel Session]] and the band signed with [[Reception Records]] who released their first single \"Mind the Gap\". Two further 12\" EPs followed in 1988 on Nightshift and Ediesta Records. Following extensive touring and positive press the band signed to [[Imaginary Records]] in 1989. Following three albums (one of which ''Elvis Belt'' was a compilation of previously released singles) on Imaginary the band signed with [[A&M Records]] in 1991. Although three singles broke into the UK Top 40 and they released two further LPs the band's fortunes declined and the band broke up in early 1995. \n\nThe band reformed in 2006 to support the release of a greatest hits album with Felix Frey replacing Dunphy on guitar. When guitarist Mike Dunphy later rejoined, drummer Steve Goodwin decided to stop touring and was replaced by Gogs Byrn. The band continue to tour and attend [[Indie rock]] festivals such as the Shiiine On weekender.\n\n==History==\nThe four-piece formed in Leeds in 1987. Their first recording was a [[Peel Session]] in June 1987, prompted by a [[demo (music)|demo tape]] they sent to [[John Peel]]. Their first single, \"Mind the Gap\", was released on [[the Wedding Present]]'s Reception Records [[record label]].<ref name=\"Dickson\">Dickson, Ian (1987) \"From Leeds, with noise!\", ''Underground'', December 1987 (Issue 9), p. 28</ref> Their second release, the ''Peel Sessions'' EP, was released on [[Strange Fruit Records]] in February 1988 - this included a [[cover version]] of [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]]'s \"[[You Sexy Thing]]\" which had already featured in the [[Festive 50]] at number 20. After building up a strong local fan base, they were signed by [[Imaginary Records]] in 1989, who released their albums, ''[[When in Rome, Kill Me]]'' and ''[[Leggy Mambo]]''. \n\nCud signed to [[A&M Records]] in 1991. The greater spending power at A&M enabled Cud to reach the [[Top 40]] in 1992, with \"Rich and Strange\" (#24) and \"Purple Love Balloon\" (#27), as well as reaching number 30 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] with fourth album ''[[Asquarius]]''.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book| author= David Roberts | year= 2006 | title= British Hit Singles & Albums | edition= 19th | publisher= Guinness World Records Limited | isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 129}}</ref> A further Top 40 single followed in 1994 with \"Neurotica\".  1994's ''Showbiz'' would be their last album. Potter was replaced by Mick Dale, who would later join [[Embrace (English band)|Embrace]], shortly before the band broke up in early 1995. They recorded a number of tracks with Dale, (who had played keyboards on earlier Cud releases) although none were commercially released and he did not feature in any live performances at that time. He has however occasionally joined the band for live performances throughout 2015-2019.\n\nOn 21 November 2001 Puttnam returned to the music scene with the mail order only release ''Donkey With a Fez On'', an album of previously unreleased demo material originally intended for release after the ''Showbiz'' album. This was followed by a live performance at the [[12 Bar Club]] in London. Puttnam was accompanied by Alaric Neville and David Lazenby on guitars, and Michael Hurst on [[Melodeon (organ)|melodeon]] and percussion. The performance was subsequently released on CD in 2002 as the mail order only ''Chateau de Carles''. \n\nCud reformed to support the release of a double album of their greatest hits entitled ''Rich and Strange - The Anthology'' which was released in August 2006 on Universal Records, alongside a brief UK tour to promote it. Dunphy was replaced by Felix Frey on guitar for the tour. The same line-up again reformed for a short tour early in 2008 to support the expanded re-releases of ''[[Elvis Belt]]'' (now a double album entitled ''Elvis Belt/Elvis Handbag''), ''[[Leggy Mambo]]'' and ''[[Showbiz (Cud album)|Showbiz]]''. At Cud's [[concert|gig]] at the [[Barfly (club)|Barfly]] in [[Liverpool]] on 6 March 2008 Puttnam suggested, contrary to suggestions on Cud's homepage, that the latest tour would be Cud's last. On 27 April 2008, Cud announced that their final ever gig (entitled \"No more Cud!\") would take place in Rios Leeds on 3 May 2008. To commemorate the event, a limited-edition CD single was sold, which was supposed to feature a new recording of \"Punishment-Reward Relationship\", along with live versions of \"Now!\", \"Only\", \"Living in the Past\" and \"Strange Kind of Love\". This was distributed as a blank printed CDR with the tracks to follow shortly afterwards. To date the songs have not been forthcoming.\n\nCud reformed again (with Puttnam, Goodwin, Potter & Frey once again) for two gigs during March, 2010, held at the Hootananny Club in London.<ref>[http://www.williampotter.com/cudband/index.html Cud back in 2010]</ref> In 2012 the band did their \"Jubilee tour\" in support of their album ''The Complete BBC Sessions'' released by 3Loop Music. This tour was their first since 2010, and the first to include original guitarist Mike Dunphy in almost 17 years. However, original drummer Steve Goodwin declined to participate so Gogs Byrn completed the lineup. During the tour the band performed live on [[Marc Riley]]'s BBC 6 Music Show. The band played further shows later in the year with [[The Wedding Present]], [[Carter USM]] & [[Ned's Atomic Dustbin]] including a sell-out show at [[Brixton Academy]]. \n\nIn 2013 [[Steve Lamacq]] premiered Cud's first new single in 17 years; a double-A side titled 'Louise/Mexico'. The band toured in November 2013 together with [[Ned's Atomic Dustbin]]. With the release of the single \"Victoria\" in 2014, Cud performed several support gigs across the UK in October. In 2015 the band played several dates in the UK in September, and appeared at the 'Shiiine On Weekender' in [[Minehead]] on 8 November. They have also appeared at the 'Gigantic' indie music festival in Manchester in April 2014 and 2016. That year Puttnam and Dunphy, performing 'alternative' versions of Cud songs under the name 'Carefree Sud' played a series of shows including the Beautiful Days festival. This offshoot also featured as support band to Cud themselves at The Belgrave Music Hall in Leeds. The band appeared at the 'Shiiine On Weekender' in November 2016, 2017 and 2018. They also completed a tour throughout 2017 where they played a set consisting of all of their 20 single releases. This was followed in 2018 by a seven-date tour entitled 'Just The Good Ones'. The set list for these shows was determined by a Facebook poll where followers were asked to vote for their ten favourite live CUD songs.\nThe band announced in December 2014, that 2015 would be the year of the new CUD album release. As yet this material is yet to surface.\n\n==Personnel==\n===Timeline===\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:1000 height:450\nPlotArea = left:200 bottom:120 top:0 right:05\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1987 till:01/03/2019\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1987\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1987\n\nColors =\n  id:voc value:red legend:Vocals\n  id:g    value:green legend:Guitars\n  id:b  value:blue legend:Bass\n  id:dr  value:orange legend:Drums\n  id:alb  value:black legend:Studio_releases\n\nLineData =\n  at:12/06/1989 layer:back\n  at:22/10/1990\n  at:29/06/1992\n  at:15/04/1994\n\nPlotData =\n  width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,\u20134)\n  bar:Carl&nbsp;Puttnam from:start till:31/08/1995 color:voc\n  bar:Carl&nbsp;Puttnam from:01/01/2006 till:end color:voc\n  bar:William&nbsp;Potter from:start till:31/01/1995 color:b \n  bar:William&nbsp;Potter from:01/01/2006 till:end color:b \n  bar:Mick&nbsp;Dale from:10/02/1995 till:31/08/1995 color:b \n  bar:Mike&nbsp;Dunphy from:start till:31/08/1995 color:g\n  bar:Mike&nbsp;Dunphy from:01/01/2012 till:end color:g \n  bar:Felix&nbsp;Frey from:01/01/2006 till:31/12/2011 color:g\n  bar:Steve&nbsp;Goodwin from:start till:31/08/1995 color:dr \n  bar:Steve&nbsp;Goodwin from:01/01/2006 till:31/12/2011 color:dr\n  bar:Gogs&nbsp;Byrn from:01/01/2012 till:end color:dr\n</timeline>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===UK singles===\n{{div col}}\n# \"Mind the Gap\" (Reception 1987)\n# \"The Peel Sessions: Cud\" (UK Strange Fruit 1988)\n# \"Under My Hat\" (UK Ediesta 1988)\n# \"Slack Time\" (UK Dug/Nightshift 1988)\n# \"Lola\" (UK Imaginary MIRAGE 1989)\n# \"Only (A Prawn in Whitby)\" (Imaginary MIRAGE 1989)\n# \"Hey!

The original line up included [[singing|vocalist]] Carl Puttnam, [[guitarist]]/[[keyboardist]] Mike Dunphy, [[bassist]] William Potter, and [[drummer]] Steve Goodwin.\n\nIn June 1987 they recorded a [[Peel Session]] and the band signed with [[Reception Records]] who released their first single \"Mind the Gap\". Two further 12\" EPs followed in 1988 on Nightshift and Ediesta Records. Following extensive touring and positive press the band signed to [[Imaginary Records]] in 1989. Following three albums (one of which ''Elvis Belt'' was a compilation of previously released singles) on Imaginary the band signed with [[A&M Records]] in 1991. Although three singles broke into the UK Top 40 and they released two further LPs the band's fortunes declined and the band broke up in early 1995. \n\nThe band reformed in 2006 to support the release of a greatest hits album with Felix Frey replacing Dunphy on guitar. When guitarist Mike Dunphy later rejoined, drummer Steve Goodwin decided to stop touring and was replaced by Gogs Byrn. The band continue to tour and attend [[Indie rock]] festivals such as the Shiiine On weekender.\n\n==History==\nThe four-piece formed in Leeds in 1987. Their first recording was a [[Peel Session]] in June 1987, prompted by a [[demo (music)|demo tape]] they sent to [[John Peel]]. Their first single, \"Mind the Gap\", was released on [[the Wedding Present]]'s Reception Records [[record label]].<ref name=\"Dickson\">Dickson, Ian (1987) \"From Leeds, with noise!\", ''Underground'', December 1987 (Issue 9), p. 28</ref> Their second release, the ''Peel Sessions'' EP, was released on [[Strange Fruit Records]] in February 1988 - this included a [[cover version]] of [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]]'s \"[[You Sexy Thing]]\" which had already featured in the [[Festive 50]] at number 20. After building up a strong local fan base, they were signed by [[Imaginary Records]] in 1989, who released their albums, ''[[When in Rome, Kill Me]]'' and ''[[Leggy Mambo]]''. \n\nCud signed to [[A&M Records]] in 1991. The greater spending power at A&M enabled Cud to reach the [[Top 40]] in 1992, with \"Rich and Strange\" (#24) and \"Purple Love Balloon\" (#27), as well as reaching number 30 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] with fourth album ''[[Asquarius]]''.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book| author= David Roberts | year= 2006 | title= British Hit Singles & Albums | edition= 19th | publisher= Guinness World Records Limited | isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 129}}</ref> A further Top 40 single followed in 1994 with \"Neurotica\".  1994's ''Showbiz'' would be their last album. Potter was replaced by Mick Dale, who would later join [[Embrace (English band)|Embrace]], shortly before the band broke up in early 1995. They recorded a number of tracks with Dale, (who had played keyboards on earlier Cud releases) although none were commercially released and he did not feature in any live performances at that time.

Pawnee was the territorial capital for exactly five days \u2013 the legislature met there from July 2 to July 6 \u2013 before legislators voted to move the capital to [[Shawnee Methodist Mission|Shawnee Mission]], which is located in present-day [[Fairway, Kansas|Fairway]].  It may be the shortest-lived capital of any U.S. state or territory ([[Old Colorado City|Colorado City]] also served as the capital of the newly established [[Colorado Territory]] for five days in 1862 but was not federally recognized).\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n{{See also|History of Kansas}}\nFor many [[millennia]], the [[Great Plains]] of [[North America]] was inhabited by [[nomadic]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  From the 16th century to 18th century, the [[Kingdom of France]] claimed ownership of large parts of [[North America]].  In 1762, after the [[French and Indian War]], France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]].  In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].  In 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized.\n\n===Establishing the town===\nPawnee, named after a native tribe that had inhabited its land,{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=3}} was located on the far western frontier of Kansas Territory, between the new settlement of [[Manhattan, Kansas]], and the [[U.S. Army]] post at [[Fort Riley]].  Pawnee was first laid out in 1854.{{sfn|Blackmar|1912|page=451}} Fort Riley's commander, Colonel William R. Montgomery, authorized the acquisition by the Pawnee Town Association investors of 400 acres believed to be part of the [[Military base|military reservation]].{{sfn|Nichols|1931|page=418}} In December 1854 or January 1855, the site was selected as capital by recently-commissioned first [[List of Governors of Kansas#Governors|Territorial Governor]] [[Andrew Reeder]], after his delayed arrival from [[Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Nichols|1931|pages=407\u2013410}} Governor Reeder had an economic stake in the site, since he was one of the investors and a new landowner in the settlement,{{sfn|Nichols|1931|p=418}} and he was not disappointed: Within six weeks of his announcement, hundreds of people arrived in the town.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=4}}  It quickly sprouted new homes, stores, and hotels,{{sfn|Holloway|1868|page=168}}{{sfn|Blackmar|1912|page=168}} and he soon built a 2-story log cabin there that became known as the \"Governor's Mansion\".{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=4}}\n\n===Electing the Territorial Legislature===\nThe Governor had failed to take an accurate territorial [[census]] before the first election of representatives to help ensure valid results. The February 1855 census showed 36 residents in Pawnee, but 75 votes were cast there{{sfn|Holloway|1868|pp=148\u2013149}} in the March 30 [[election]], held at the home of [[Robert Klotz]].{{sfn|House|1856|472}} The number reflected [[emigrant]]s who had arrived within that month, and election returns indicated no ''illegal'' voters at Pawnee.{{efn|In an 1856 report to [[United States Congress|Congress]], judges certified 75 true tallies.{{sfn|House|1856|472-473}} }} But the same could not be said at polling places throughout much of the rest of the territory, as more than 800 illegal votes were identified in both [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] and [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]]{{sfn|Holloway|1868|pp=148\u2013149}} and more than 4,000 territory-wide.{{sfn|Prentis|1909|pages=81\u201382}}\n\n[[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-state]] interests had been bolstered by the arrival of new settlers from New England who were aided by the [[New England Emigrant Aid Company|Emigrant Aid Company]].{{sfn|Holloway|1868|pages=149\u2013151}} But many free-staters felt that Reeder had intentionally delayed the spring election until pro-slavery men from neighboring [[Missouri]] could arrive and cast votes they should not have been allowed.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=7}} Missouri residents overran the polling places and threatened legitimate voters who were residents or planned to be such.{{sfn|Etcheson|2004|pages=55\u201360}} Ultimately, only 8 of the 39 men elected had free-state intentions.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=23}}\n\n===One week of action===\nThe Territorial Legislature first met in Pawnee on July 2, 1855,{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|page=62}} composed mostly of the pro-slavery delegates fraudulently elected.  They were unhappy that Governor Reeder had put the capital over 100 miles from the Missouri border, feeling that the location favored the free-state advocates in Kansas Territory.{{sfn|Weiser|2017}}  What the legislators feared was precisely Reeder's intention, as he believed a free Kansas favored his personal land interests throughout the territory.{{sfn|Nichols|1931|page=410}}\n\nUndiscouraged, the pro-slavery legislators' first action was to unseat all but one of the free-state men, and one who lost his position exclaimed that they were, \"lighting the watchfires of war\".{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=23}} The only free-state legislator who remained, Martin Conway, appeared also to be at odds with Reeder, standing during the Governor's opening address to denounce the body and proclaim that he was prepared to dishonor any of its laws.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|page=62}} Despite the Governor and Conway, another quick action the legislators took was a successful vote to move the capital to [[Shawnee Methodist Mission|Shawnee Mission]], on the Missouri border. Governor Reeder [[veto]]ed the measure, recalling the expense the town of Pawnee had already taken to build the capital city.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=4}} The Territorial Legislature overrode his veto, and next met in Shawnee on July 16.{{sfn|Weiser|2017}} Nevertheless, Reeder continued to insist Pawnee was the capital, vetoing any legislation that reached him, believing that the lawmakers were not in legal session.{{sfn|Etcheson|2004|page=67}}\n\nBecause of its unscrupulous origin and actions, the group became known as the Bogus Legislature.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=5}} The pro-slavery men had never intended to reside in Pawnee, ignoring the nearby boarding houses available and arriving prepared to camp outside.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=8}} After the vote to relocate, the Kansas Legislature never stayed in Pawnee again{{dash}}July 6, 1855 was its last day as capital city{{dash}}it served only five days.{{efn|Some accounts claim that the legislature met at Pawnee for only four days rather than five. However, Governor Reeder in his own testimony to the [[34th United States Congress]],{{sfn|House|1856|page=937}} said the legislature adjourned, \"about the sixth of July,\" and his own report on his veto, published in the [[New York Times]]{{sfn|Times|1855}} and citing the legislative record, said definitively that the legislature met on the sixth. They passed the Shawnee measure on the July 4th holiday,{{sfn|KSHS|2002}} and therefore, \"five\" is being used here.}}\n\n===Destruction===\nSoon after Pawnee lost its function as capital, in September 1855, [[Jefferson Davis]], the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], surveyed the settlement and showed the results to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin Pierce]]. On the resulting map, the survey indicated the eastern boundary of Fort Riley both with and without Pawnee, and the lines excluding the town were accepted.{{sfn|Holloway|1868|page=169}} It was ordered to be destroyed and its land reincorporated back into Fort Riley.{{sfn|Nichols|1931|page=418}} Notices signed by Pierce were posted on every structure instructing everyone to leave by October 10.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=10}} A Major Cook with 1,000 of his [[Texas]] troops were charged with evacuating the residents, many of whom were unwilling to leave.{{sfn|Blackmar|1912|page=451}} By the night of the 10th, some residents still remained. The Governor's Mansion, abandoned by its first tenant who unhappily left for Shawnee, was pulled down with its next residents still inside. In another home, a woman with her infant was carried out on a mattress and taken across the border line of the reservation.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=11}} Most of the buildings, including all of its houses, were demolished,{{sfn|Holloway|1868|page=159}} meaning financial ruin for many families.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=12}} Other Kansas towns developed under similar circumstances but lacking significant free-state aspirants did not suffer the same fate.{{sfn|Blackmar|1912|page=452}}\n\n==Pawnee later and today==\nMany residents left town with the legislators immediately after their adjournment on July 6. Those who did not were faced with a [[cholera]] [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics#Third, 1852\u20131860|outbreak]] in August. Fort Riley was also affected.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=24}} [[Union Pacific Railroad]] lines reached the abandoned town in 1866 \u2013 as part of a transcontinental route approved by the Pawnee legislature \u2013 passing just yards away from the north side of the capitol.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=26}} Its passage through Pawnee was due in part to the unreliability of the nearby river for navigation.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|pages=28\u201329}}\n\n===First Territorial Capitol State Historic Site===\n{{main|First Territorial Capitol of Kansas}}\n[[File:Kansas Territorial Capitol.jpg|thumb|The capitol under construction.]]\nDavis had determined most of the town to be within the boundaries of Fort Riley; its eastern edge at the mouth of Onemile Creek.{{sfn|Blackmar|1912|page=451}} Only the capitol building was spared from demolition. During its brief service by the legislature, it was a very uncomfortable meeting space due partly to the fact that it was not complete.{{sfn|Etcheson|2004|page=67}}{{sfn|KSHS|2002}} The floor boards were not nailed down, and a hole in the exterior wall left for construction purposes still remained at the second floor.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|pages=4\u20135}}\n\nAfter the legislature departed, townspeople entered the building and found, according to one of them, \"...a room full of confusion and disorder. Torn pamphlets, scraps of papers, and rubbish of all descriptions were scattered about.\"{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|pages=9\u201310}}{{efn|The resident quoted was a \"Mrs. Hadden\". No first name was given by the source.}} The awkward edifice was used shortly afterward as a warehouse.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=12}}\n\nThe structure, now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], is within the current boundary of the military reservation, and has since served a variety of other uses. It has also functioned as a church, a bachelor's club, housing and a carpentry shop.{{sfn|Ft. Riley|2014}}{{sfn|Weiser|2017}}  In the 1920s the [[Kansas Historical Society]] and Union Pacific took over responsibility for the building and repaired it.{{sfn|Army|2017}} It was rededicated in 1928 with a grand celebration{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=15}} and became a history museum.{{sfn|Weiser|2017}} In 1961, the state legislature met in the Pawnee capitol again, for one day, during [[State (polity)|statehood]] [[centennial]] celebrations.{{sfn|World|2011}}\n\nToday the museum features exhibits on Kansas Territory, rail and river travel in the region, and the history of Pawnee. Because it is now part of a military installation, arrangements must be made in advance for the general public to visit the museum. A driving tour of the base is available, featuring several historic sites, including the First Territorial Capitol.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pawnee people]] \u2013 The tribe behind the name\n* [[Bleeding Kansas]] \u2013 Details of the ongoing conflict\n* [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] \u2013 The federal bill that created the problems\n* [[List of capitals in the United States|Capitals of the United States]] \u2013 Historic locations, including of the territories\n* [[Geographic center of the contiguous United States]] \u2013 A more commonly accepted location (near [[Lebanon, Kansas]]) of the midpoint of the adjoining 48 states, marked, perhaps mistakenly, on the [[:File:Fort Riley and Pawnee Kansas.jpg|1909 Jefferson Township plat map]].

Pawnee was the territorial capital for exactly five days \u2013 the legislature met there from July 2 to July 6 \u2013 before legislators voted to move the capital to [[Shawnee Methodist Mission|Shawnee Mission]], which is located in present-day [[Fairway, Kansas|Fairway]].  It may be the shortest-lived capital of any U.S. state or territory ([[Old Colorado City|Colorado City]] also served as the capital of the newly established [[Colorado Territory]] for five days in 1862 but was not federally recognized).\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n{{See also|History of Kansas}}\nFor many [[millennia]], the [[Great Plains]] of [[North America]] was inhabited by [[nomadic]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  From the 16th century to 18th century, the [[Kingdom of France]] claimed ownership of large parts of [[North America]].  In 1762, after the [[French and Indian War]], France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]].  In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].  In 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized.\n\n===Establishing the town===\nPawnee, named after a native tribe that had inhabited its land,{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=3}} was located on the far western frontier of Kansas Territory, between the new settlement of [[Manhattan, Kansas]], and the [[U.S. Army]] post at [[Fort Riley]].  Pawnee was first laid out in 1854.{{sfn|Blackmar|1912|page=451}} Fort Riley's commander, Colonel William R. Montgomery, authorized the acquisition by the Pawnee Town Association investors of 400 acres believed to be part of the [[Military base|military reservation]].{{sfn|Nichols|1931|page=418}} In December 1854 or January 1855, the site was selected as capital by recently-commissioned first [[List of Governors of Kansas#Governors|Territorial Governor]] [[Andrew Reeder]], after his delayed arrival from [[Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Nichols|1931|pages=407\u2013410}} Governor Reeder had an economic stake in the site, since he was one of the investors and a new landowner in the settlement,{{sfn|Nichols|1931|p=418}} and he was not disappointed: Within six weeks of his announcement, hundreds of people arrived in the town.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=4}}  It quickly sprouted new homes, stores, and hotels,{{sfn|Holloway|1868|page=168}}{{sfn|Blackmar|1912|page=168}} and he soon built a 2-story log cabin there that became known as the \"Governor's Mansion\".{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=4}}\n\n===Electing the Territorial Legislature===\nThe Governor had failed to take an accurate territorial [[census]] before the first election of representatives to help ensure valid results. The February 1855 census showed 36 residents in Pawnee, but 75 votes were cast there{{sfn|Holloway|1868|pp=148\u2013149}} in the March 30 [[election]], held at the home of [[Robert Klotz]].{{sfn|House|1856|472}} The number reflected [[emigrant]]s who had arrived within that month, and election returns indicated no ''illegal'' voters at Pawnee.{{efn|In an 1856 report to [[United States Congress|Congress]], judges certified 75 true tallies.{{sfn|House|1856|472-473}} }} But the same could not be said at polling places throughout much of the rest of the territory, as more than 800 illegal votes were identified in both [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] and [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]]{{sfn|Holloway|1868|pp=148\u2013149}} and more than 4,000 territory-wide.{{sfn|Prentis|1909|pages=81\u201382}}\n\n[[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-state]] interests had been bolstered by the arrival of new settlers from New England who were aided by the [[New England Emigrant Aid Company|Emigrant Aid Company]].{{sfn|Holloway|1868|pages=149\u2013151}} But many free-staters felt that Reeder had intentionally delayed the spring election until pro-slavery men from neighboring [[Missouri]] could arrive and cast votes they should not have been allowed.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=7}} Missouri residents overran the polling places and threatened legitimate voters who were residents or planned to be such.{{sfn|Etcheson|2004|pages=55\u201360}} Ultimately, only 8 of the 39 men elected had free-state intentions.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=23}}\n\n===One week of action===\nThe Territorial Legislature first met in Pawnee on July 2, 1855,{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|page=62}} composed mostly of the pro-slavery delegates fraudulently elected.  They were unhappy that Governor Reeder had put the capital over 100 miles from the Missouri border, feeling that the location favored the free-state advocates in Kansas Territory.{{sfn|Weiser|2017}}  What the legislators feared was precisely Reeder's intention, as he believed a free Kansas favored his personal land interests throughout the territory.{{sfn|Nichols|1931|page=410}}\n\nUndiscouraged, the pro-slavery legislators' first action was to unseat all but one of the free-state men, and one who lost his position exclaimed that they were, \"lighting the watchfires of war\".{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=23}} The only free-state legislator who remained, Martin Conway, appeared also to be at odds with Reeder, standing during the Governor's opening address to denounce the body and proclaim that he was prepared to dishonor any of its laws.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|page=62}} Despite the Governor and Conway, another quick action the legislators took was a successful vote to move the capital to [[Shawnee Methodist Mission|Shawnee Mission]], on the Missouri border. Governor Reeder [[veto]]ed the measure, recalling the expense the town of Pawnee had already taken to build the capital city.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=4}} The Territorial Legislature overrode his veto, and next met in Shawnee on July 16.{{sfn|Weiser|2017}} Nevertheless, Reeder continued to insist Pawnee was the capital, vetoing any legislation that reached him, believing that the lawmakers were not in legal session.{{sfn|Etcheson|2004|page=67}}\n\nBecause of its unscrupulous origin and actions, the group became known as the Bogus Legislature.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=5}} The pro-slavery men had never intended to reside in Pawnee, ignoring the nearby boarding houses available and arriving prepared to camp outside.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=8}} After the vote to relocate, the Kansas Legislature never stayed in Pawnee again{{dash}}July 6, 1855 was its last day as capital city{{dash}}it served only five days.{{efn|Some accounts claim that the legislature met at Pawnee for only four days rather than five. However, Governor Reeder in his own testimony to the [[34th United States Congress]],{{sfn|House|1856|page=937}} said the legislature adjourned, \"about the sixth of July,\" and his own report on his veto, published in the [[New York Times]]{{sfn|Times|1855}} and citing the legislative record, said definitively that the legislature met on the sixth. They passed the Shawnee measure on the July 4th holiday,{{sfn|KSHS|2002}} and therefor, \"five\" is being used here.}}\n\n===Destruction===\nSoon after Pawnee lost its function as capital, in September 1855, [[Jefferson Davis]], the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], surveyed the settlement and showed the results to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin Pierce]]. On the resulting map, the survey indicated the eastern boundary of Fort Riley both with and without Pawnee, and the lines excluding the town were accepted.{{sfn|Holloway|1868|page=169}} It was ordered to be destroyed and its land reincorporated back into Fort Riley.{{sfn|Nichols|1931|page=418}} Notices signed by Pierce were posted on every structure instructing everyone to leave by October 10.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=10}} A Major Cook with 1,000 of his [[Texas]] troops were charged with evacuating the residents, many of whom were unwilling to leave.{{sfn|Blackmar|1912|page=451}} By the night of the 10th, some residents still remained. The Governor's Mansion, abandoned by its first tenant who unhappily left for Shawnee, was pulled down with its next residents still inside. In another home, a woman with her infant was carried out on a mattress and taken across the border line of the reservation.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=11}} Most of the buildings, including all of its houses, were demolished,{{sfn|Holloway|1868|page=159}} meaning financial ruin for many families.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=12}} Other Kansas towns developed under similar circumstances but lacking significant free-state aspirants did not suffer the same fate.{{sfn|Blackmar|1912|page=452}}\n\n==Pawnee later and today==\nMany residents left town with the legislators immediately after their adjournment on July 6. Those who did not were faced with a [[cholera]] [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics#Third, 1852\u20131860|outbreak]] in August. Fort Riley was also affected.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=24}} [[Union Pacific Railroad]] lines reached the abandoned town in 1866 \u2013 as part of a transcontinental route approved by the Pawnee legislature \u2013 passing just yards away from the north side of the capitol.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=26}} Its passage through Pawnee was due in part to the unreliability of the nearby river for navigation.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|pages=28\u201329}}\n\n===First Territorial Capitol State Historic Site===\n{{main|First Territorial Capitol of Kansas}}\n[[File:Kansas Territorial Capitol.jpg|thumb|The capitol under construction.]]\nDavis had determined most of the town to be within the boundaries of Fort Riley; its eastern edge at the mouth of Onemile Creek.{{sfn|Blackmar|1912|page=451}} Only the capitol building was spared from demolition. During its brief service by the legislature, it was a very uncomfortable meeting space due partly to the fact that it was not complete.{{sfn|Etcheson|2004|page=67}}{{sfn|KSHS|2002}} The floor boards were not nailed down, and a hole in the exterior wall left for construction purposes still remained at the second floor.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|pages=4\u20135}}\n\nAfter the legislature departed, townspeople entered the building and found, according to one of them, \"...a room full of confusion and disorder. Torn pamphlets, scraps of papers, and rubbish of all descriptions were scattered about.\"{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|pages=9\u201310}}{{efn|The resident quoted was a \"Mrs. Hadden\". No first name was given by the source.}} The awkward edifice was used shortly afterward as a warehouse.{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=12}}\n\nThe structure, now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], is within the current boundary of the military reservation, and has since served a variety of other uses. It has also functioned as a church, a bachelor's club, housing and a carpentry shop.{{sfn|Ft. Riley|2014}}{{sfn|Weiser|2017}}  In the 1920s the [[Kansas Historical Society]] and Union Pacific took over responsibility for the building and repaired it.{{sfn|Army|2017}} It was rededicated in 1928 with a grand celebration{{sfn|Historical Society|1928|page=15}} and became a history museum.{{sfn|Weiser|2017}} In 1961, the state legislature met in the Pawnee capitol again, for one day, during [[State (polity)|statehood]] [[centennial]] celebrations.{{sfn|World|2011}}\n\nToday the museum features exhibits on Kansas Territory, rail and river travel in the region, and the history of Pawnee.
