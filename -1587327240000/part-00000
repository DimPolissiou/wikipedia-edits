The term may refer to any belief about the nature of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] that affirms [[God]] as a singular entity and rejects the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], as affirmed by the [[Nicene Creed|mainstream Christianity]]: a consensus of Christian bishops at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A Spanish physician, [[Michael Servetus]], studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books ''On the Errors of the Trinity'' and ''Christianismi Restitutio'' caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] in 1553.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miguelservet.org/servetus/biography.htm |title=Michael Servetus Institute; Times that Servetus lived |publisher=Miguelservet.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Unitarian\" entered the English language via [[Henry Hedworth]], who applied it to the teachings of [[Laelio Sozzini]] and the Polish [[Socinians]]. Unitarian churches were formally established in [[Transylvania]] and [[Poland]] (by the [[Socinianism|Socinians]]) in the second half of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris, MW. Unitarian Universalist Origins: Our Historic Faith</ref> There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see [[Edict of Torda]]) under the jurisdiction of [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John Sigismund]], king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the [[pre-existence of Christ]] as well as, in many cases, [[predestination]] and [[original sin]] as put forward by [[Augustine of Hippo]], and the [[substitutionary atonement]] of Christ developed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and John Calvin. There were several different forms of [[Christology]] in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became [[psilanthropism]]: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.\n\n====Britain====\n{{main|History of Unitarianism}}\nInfluenced by the teachings of the Polish [[Socinians]], [[Samuel Clarke]] (1675\u20131729) revised the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', removing the Trinitarian [[Nicene Creed]] and references to [[divinity of Jesus|Jesus as God]].<ref name=Clarke>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/fisherhistory.htm |title=Chris Fisher, ''A Brief History of Unitarian Christianity'', retrieved July 18, 2008 |publisher=Americanunitarian.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref> [[Theophilus Lindsey]] also revised the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation. Neither cleric was charged under the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] that made it an \"offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the [[Holy Trinity]]\". The [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] (1689) gave relief to [[English Dissenters]], but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the [[Church of England]]. In response, in 1774, Lindsey applied for registration of the [[Essex Street Chapel|Essex House]] as a \"Dissenting place of worship\" with the assistance of [[barrister]] [[John Lee (Attorney-General)|John Lee]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1959_StoryEssexHall.pdf|first=Mortimer|last=Rowe|location=London|publisher=Lindsey Press}}</ref>  On the Sunday following the registration\u2014April 17, 1774\u2014the first true Unitarian congregation discreetly convened in the provisional Essex Street Chapel.

The official statement of Unitarian Universalist principles describes the \"sources\" upon which current practice is based:<ref name=sources/>{{quotation|\n* Direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life;\n* Words and deeds of prophetic people which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love;\n* Wisdom from the [[Major religious groups|world's religions]] which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life;\n* Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to respond to God's love by loving our neighbors as ourselves;\n* [[Humanism|Humanist]] teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of science, and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit.\n* Spiritual teachings of [[Earth religion|earth-centered traditions]] which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.}}\n\nUnitarian Universalist principles and purposes have been modified over time to manifest a broader acceptance of beliefs and traditions among the membership. The seventh Principle (adopted in 1985), \"Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part\", and a sixth Source (adopted in 1995), \"Spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature\" were added to explicitly include members with [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], and [[Pantheism|pantheist]] spiritualities.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/3643.shtml?lj\n | title = Shared values: How the UUA's Principles and Purposes were shaped and how they've shaped Unitarian Universalism\n | accessdate = 2007-02-24\n | author = Warren R.

Today, the Unitarian Universalist approach to the [[Bible|Christian Bible]], [[Tanakh|Hebrew Scriptures]], and other sacred works is presented by the UUA:\n{{quotation|While Unitarianism and Universalism both have roots in the Protestant Christian tradition, where the Bible is the sacred text, we now look to additional sources for religious and moral inspiration\u2026. We celebrate the spiritual insights of the world\u2019s religions, recognizing wisdom in many scriptures.\n\nWhen we read scripture in worship, whether it is the [[Bible]], the [[Dhammapada]], or the [[Tao Te-Ching]], we interpret it as a product of its time and its place,\u2026not to be interpreted narrowly or oppressively\u2026<nowiki>[</nowiki>S<nowiki>]</nowiki>cripture is never the only word, or the final word.\n\nFrom the beginning we have trusted in the human capacity to use reason and draw conclusions about religion\u2026 [E]ach of us ultimately chooses what is sacred to us.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Sacred texts in Unitarian Universalism\n |url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/sacred-texts\n |access-date=2017-12-05\n}}</ref>}}\n\nIn short, Unitarian Universalists regard the texts of the world's religions as works of people, worthy of respect, with the intention that people from all religions or spiritual backgrounds live peaceably with one another.\n\n==Worship and practice==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Diversity of practices===\nThe Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish [[Passover Seder|Seder]], [[Yom Kippur]] and Passover dinners, ''[[iftaar]]'' meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/[[Winter Solstice#Observances|Winter Solstice]] services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a [[Hindu]] temple, a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue, and a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church.\n\nThere is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.\n\n===Diversity of congregations===\nThere is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves \"churches\", \"societies\", \"fellowships\", \"congregations\", or eschew the use of any particular descriptor (e.g. \"[http://www.uusanmateo.org Unitarian Universalists of San Mateo]\"). Many use the name \"Unitarian Universalist\", (and a few \"Universalist Unitarian\"), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation \"Unitarian\" or \"Universalist\" (e.g. \"[[First Unitarian Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|First Unitarian Church]]\"). A few congregations use neither (e.g. [[Unity Temple]]). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word \"church\" indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation's lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as ''fellowship'' and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).<ref>See for examples: [http://www.uufellowship.org Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Westchester] and [http://www.uuathensga.org/ Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens].</ref>\n\nAlso of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey),<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html Largest Religious Groups in the United States of America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820080454/http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html |date=2018-08-20 }}, Adherents.com</ref> reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.\n\n===Elevator speeches===\nIn 2004, ''UU World'' magazine asked for contributions of \"[[elevator pitch|elevator speeches]]\" explaining Unitarian Universalism.<ref>''UU World Magazine''.

Therefore, one's own truth is unprovable, as is that of others. Consequently, we should respect the beliefs of others, as well as their right to hold those beliefs. Conversely, we expect that others should respect our right to our own beliefs. Several UU's then, would likely hold as many different beliefs. Other beliefs they may hold in common are a respect for others, for nature, and for common decency, leading to a particular caring for the poor, the weak and the downtrodden. As a result, issues of justice, including social justice are held in common among most. | Gene Douglas, Harrah, OK<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uuduluth.org/newsletters/nov06news.html |title=Dear Ones |accessdate=2007-02-24 |author=Karen Johnson Gustafson |date=November 2006 |work=Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Duluth Newsletter |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929140837/http://www.uuduluth.org/newsletters/nov06news.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\n{{quote | It's a blessing each of us was born; It matters what we do with our lives; What each of us knows about God is a piece of the truth; We don't have to do it alone.\n\n|Laila Ibrahim, Berkeley, CA<ref name=\"affirmations\"/>}}\n\n==Worship and ritual==\nAs in theology, Unitarian Universalist [[worship]] and [[ritual]] are often a combination of elements derived from other faith traditions alongside original practices and symbols. In form, church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church, but they vary widely among congregations.<ref name=\"Sias\"/>\n\n===Symbols===\nThe most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the [[flaming chalice]], often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism (the symbol has no official interpretation). The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] also use a chalice as their denomination symbol<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |title=The Chalice \n |accessdate=2012-01-21 \n |publisher=[[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112154823/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |archivedate=January 12, 2012 \n}}</ref>). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was created by Austrian artist [[Hans Deutsch]]. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/aboutuu/chalice.html\n| title = The History of the Flaming Chalice\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Adapted from the pamphlet \"The Flaming Chalice\" by Daniel D. Hotchkiss\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech [[Jan Hus]], which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus's early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant. In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark W.|last=Harris|title=The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism| publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=London}}</ref>   Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services. Other symbols include an [[Christian cross variants#Modern innovations|off-center cross within a circle]] (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).\n\nOther symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a [[dove]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://archive.uua.org/CONG/chalices/\n| title = UU Chalices and Clip Art\n| accessdate = 2008-04-12\n| author = Steve Bridenbaugh\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\n===Services of worship===\n[[File:UM 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[First Unitarian Society of Madison|Unitarian Meeting House]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin]].]]\nReligious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition.<ref name=\"Sias\"/> Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html\n| title = Common Worship: How and Why; The contribution of Von Ogden Vogt\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Commission on Common Worship\n| year = 1983\n| work = Leading Congregations in Worship: A Guide\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217132901/http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-17}}</ref> Sermons may cover a wide range of topics. Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.\n\nThe service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, ''Singing the Journey''<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-499-1|title=Singing the Journey|year=2005}}</ref> contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older ''Singing the Living Tradition'' which contains readings as well.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-260-3|title=Singing the Living Tradition|year=1993}}</ref> Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources\u2014traditional [[hymn tune]]s with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.\n\nPastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to [[Ceremonial use of lights|light a candle]] or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of [[meditation]] or [[prayer]], led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called \"talk back\", where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.\n\nMany Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian symbols of [[baptism]], [[Eucharist|communion]], or [[confirmation]], at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often [[federated congregation|federated church]]es or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] or similar covenant groups.<ref>[http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm Christians 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108233643/http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm |date=January 8, 2009 }}</ref> \"Child dedications\" often replace more traditional infant baptisms (such \"dedications\" are sometimes practiced even in \"orthodox\" Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons).

The \n[[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|second women's rights convention]] was held at the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester|First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York]].

Anthony]], a Unitarian and [[Quaker]], was extremely influential in the women's [[suffrage]] movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.\n\nUnitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end [[racism]] in the United States. [[John Haynes Holmes]], a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York\u2014Unitarian Universalist were among the founders of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909 and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. [[James J. Reeb]], a minister at [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|All Souls Church, Unitarian]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a member of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], was clubbed in [[Selma, Alabama]] on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, [[Viola Liuzzo]], a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] for voting rights are best known for [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]], which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.\n\nThe past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001\u20132009, [[William G.

Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.\n\nSeveral congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a \"[[Unitarian Universalism and LGBT topics#Welcoming Congregation|Welcoming Congregation]]\": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform [[same-sex unions]] and now [[same-sex marriages]] where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church \"to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 \"Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages\"], UPI, ''The New York Times'', 29 June 1984.</ref> Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly [[ordained]] as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, [[Arlington Street Church (Boston)|Arlington Street Church]], in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage\u2014\"Standing on the Side of Love\". In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of [[The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing]] published ''An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality'' to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the [[District of Columbia]] in [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)]]\n\n[[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]] engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on [[polyamory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uupa.org|title=UUPA website }}</ref> At the 2015 [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]], the Association's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of \"family and relationship structures\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |title=Unitarian Universalist Association: Rule II, Section C-2.3.: Non-discrimination |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103753/http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |archivedate=2015-05-18}}</ref> the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.\n\nMany congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and [[sustainability]].

The [[American Unitarian Conference]] and the [[Christian Universalist Association]] are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original [[American Unitarian Association]] or [[Universalist Church of America]], and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The [[Unity Church]] is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.<ref>See [http://www.americanunitarian.org/voicearticle.htm \"Why the American Unitarian Conference Had to Be Formed\"] and [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/unitarian.html \"What Is the Difference between Christian Universalism and Unitarian Universalism?\"]</ref>\n\n===Internal===\n\n====Language of reverence====\nDuring the presidency of William Sinkford, debate within the Unitarian Universalist movement roiled over his call to return to or create an authentic Unitarian Universalist \"language of reverence.\" Sinkford suggested that Unitarian Universalists abandoned traditional religious language, thereby abandoning words with potential power to others who will then dictate their meanings in the public sphere. He suggested that Unitarian Universalists regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. Others reacted to this call by believing it to be part of an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Sinkford denied this, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he means by the \"language of reverence.\" The growth of humanism in Unitarianism was determined by a desire to raise the profile to a universal audience, educating atheists and agnostics in biblical literacy among the wider congregation of Unitarian Universalists, many of whom were born into families that lacked the rigour of a moral catechism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uuworld.org/articles/need-language-reverence|title=Human reverence: The language of reverence is the language of humanity|date=2006-07-31|first=Kendyl L.R.|last=Gibbons|publisher=UU World: Liberal religion and life|accessdate=2017-12-26}}</ref>\nThe debate included the publication of a book by the UUA's [[Beacon Press]] written by former UUA President John Buehrens.<ref>{{cite web|last=Buehrens |first=John A. |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/132/story_13272_1.html |title=Past Unitarian Universalist Association President John A.

It provides interpretative strategies, so that Unitarian Universalists (among others) might be able to engage in public debate about what the Bible says from a liberal religious perspective, rather than relinquishing to religious conservatives, and other more literal interpretations, all control over the book's contents and significance in matters of public and civic import.

The term may refer to any belief about the nature of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] that affirms [[God]] as a singular entity and rejects the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], as affirmed by the [[Nicene Creed|mainstream Christianity]]: a consensus of Christian bishops at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A Spanish physician, [[Michael Servetus]], studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books ''On the Errors of the Trinity'' and ''Christianismi Restitutio'' caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] in 1553.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miguelservet.org/servetus/biography.htm |title=Michael Servetus Institute; Times that Servetus lived |publisher=Miguelservet.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Unitarian\" entered the English language via [[Henry Hedworth]], who applied it to the teachings of [[Laelio Sozzini]] and the Polish [[Socinians]]. Unitarian churches were formally established in [[Transylvania]] and [[Poland]] (by the [[Socinianism|Socinians]]) in the second half of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris, MW. Unitarian Universalist Origins: Our Historic Faith</ref> There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see [[Edict of Torda]]) under the jurisdiction of [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John Sigismund]], king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the [[pre-existence of Christ]] as well as, in many cases, [[predestination]] and [[original sin]] as put forward by [[Augustine of Hippo]], and the [[substitutionary atonement]] of Christ developed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and John Calvin. There were several different forms of [[Christology]] in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became [[psilanthropism]]: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.\n\n====Britain====\n{{main|History of Unitarianism}}\nInfluenced by the teachings of the Polish [[Socinians]], [[Samuel Clarke]] (1675\u20131729) revised the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', removing the Trinitarian [[Nicene Creed]] and references to [[divinity of Jesus|Jesus as God]].<ref name=Clarke>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/fisherhistory.htm |title=Chris Fisher, ''A Brief History of Unitarian Christianity'', retrieved July 18, 2008 |publisher=Americanunitarian.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref> [[Theophilus Lindsey]] also revised the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation. Neither cleric was charged under the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] that made it an \"offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the [[Holy Trinity]]\". The [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] (1689) gave relief to [[English Dissenters]], but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the [[Church of England]].

We celebrate the spiritual insights of the world\u2019s religions, recognizing wisdom in many scriptures.\n\nWhen we read scripture in worship, whether it is the [[Bible]], the [[Dhammapada]], or the [[Tao Te-Ching]], we interpret it as a product of its time and its place,\u2026not to be interpreted narrowly or oppressively\u2026<nowiki>[</nowiki>S<nowiki>]</nowiki>cripture is never the only word, or the final word.\n\nFrom the beginning we have trusted in the human capacity to use reason and draw conclusions about religion\u2026 [E]ach of us ultimately chooses what is sacred to us.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Sacred texts in Unitarian Universalism\n |url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/sacred-texts\n |access-date=2017-12-05\n}}</ref>}}\n\nIn short, Unitarian Universalists regard the texts of the world's religions as works of people, worthy of respect, with the intention that people from all religions or spiritual backgrounds live peaceably with one another.\n\n==Worship and practice==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Diversity of practices===\nThe Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish [[Passover Seder|Seder]], [[Yom Kippur]] and Passover dinners, ''[[iftaar]]'' meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/[[Winter Solstice#Observances|Winter Solstice]] services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a [[Hindu]] temple, a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue, and a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church.\n\nThere is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.\n\n===Diversity of congregations===\nThere is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves \"churches\", \"societies\", \"fellowships\", \"congregations\", or eschew the use of any particular descriptor (e.g. \"[http://www.uusanmateo.org Unitarian Universalists of San Mateo]\"). Many use the name \"Unitarian Universalist\", (and a few \"Universalist Unitarian\"), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation \"Unitarian\" or \"Universalist\" (e.g. \"[[First Unitarian Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|First Unitarian Church]]\"). A few congregations use neither (e.g. [[Unity Temple]]). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word \"church\" indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation's lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as ''fellowship'' and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).<ref>See for examples: [http://www.uufellowship.org Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Westchester] and [http://www.uuathensga.org/ Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens].</ref>\n\nAlso of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey),<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html Largest Religious Groups in the United States of America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820080454/http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html |date=2018-08-20 }}, Adherents.com</ref> reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.\n\n===Elevator speeches===\nIn 2004, ''UU World'' magazine asked for contributions of \"[[elevator pitch|elevator speeches]]\" explaining Unitarian Universalism.<ref>''UU World Magazine''.

Therefore, one's own truth is unprovable, as is that of others. Consequently, we should respect the beliefs of others, as well as their right to hold those beliefs. Conversely, we expect that others should respect our right to our own beliefs. Several UU's then, would likely hold as many different beliefs. Other beliefs they may hold in common are a respect for others, for nature, and for common decency, leading to a particular caring for the poor, the weak and the downtrodden.

In form, church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church, but they vary widely among congregations.<ref name=\"Sias\"/>\n\n===Symbols===\nThe most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the [[flaming chalice]], often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism (the symbol has no official interpretation). The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] also use a chalice as their denomination symbol<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |title=The Chalice \n |accessdate=2012-01-21 \n |publisher=[[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112154823/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |archivedate=January 12, 2012 \n}}</ref>). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was created by Austrian artist [[Hans Deutsch]]. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/aboutuu/chalice.html\n| title = The History of the Flaming Chalice\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Adapted from the pamphlet \"The Flaming Chalice\" by Daniel D. Hotchkiss\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech [[Jan Hus]], which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus's early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant. In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark W.|last=Harris|title=The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism| publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=London}}</ref>   Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services. Other symbols include an [[Christian cross variants#Modern innovations|off-center cross within a circle]] (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).\n\nOther symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a [[dove]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://archive.uua.org/CONG/chalices/\n| title = UU Chalices and Clip Art\n| accessdate = 2008-04-12\n| author = Steve Bridenbaugh\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\n===Services of worship===\n[[File:UM 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[First Unitarian Society of Madison|Unitarian Meeting House]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin]].]]\nReligious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition.<ref name=\"Sias\"/> Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html\n| title = Common Worship: How and Why; The contribution of Von Ogden Vogt\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Commission on Common Worship\n| year = 1983\n| work = Leading Congregations in Worship: A Guide\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217132901/http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-17}}</ref> Sermons may cover a wide range of topics. Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.\n\nThe service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, ''Singing the Journey''<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-499-1|title=Singing the Journey|year=2005}}</ref> contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older ''Singing the Living Tradition'' which contains readings as well.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-260-3|title=Singing the Living Tradition|year=1993}}</ref> Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources\u2014traditional [[hymn tune]]s with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.\n\nPastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to [[Ceremonial use of lights|light a candle]] or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of [[meditation]] or [[prayer]], led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called \"talk back\", where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.\n\nMany Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian symbols of [[baptism]], [[Eucharist|communion]], or [[confirmation]], at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often [[federated congregation|federated church]]es or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] or similar covenant groups.<ref>[http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm Christians 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108233643/http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm |date=January 8, 2009 }}</ref> \"Child dedications\" often replace more traditional infant baptisms (such \"dedications\" are sometimes practiced even in \"orthodox\" Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons).

The \n[[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|second women's rights convention]] was held at the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester|First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York]].

Anthony]], a Unitarian and [[Quaker]], was extremely influential in the women's [[suffrage]] movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.\n\nUnitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end [[racism]] in the United States. [[John Haynes Holmes]], a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York\u2014Unitarian Universalist were among the founders of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909 and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. [[James J. Reeb]], a minister at [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|All Souls Church, Unitarian]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a member of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], was clubbed in [[Selma, Alabama]] on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, [[Viola Liuzzo]], a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] for voting rights are best known for [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]], which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.\n\nThe past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001\u20132009, [[William G.

Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.\n\nSeveral congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a \"[[Unitarian Universalism and LGBT topics#Welcoming Congregation|Welcoming Congregation]]\": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform [[same-sex unions]] and now [[same-sex marriages]] where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church \"to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 \"Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages\"], UPI, ''The New York Times'', 29 June 1984.</ref> Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly [[ordained]] as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, [[Arlington Street Church (Boston)|Arlington Street Church]], in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage\u2014\"Standing on the Side of Love\". In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of [[The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing]] published ''An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality'' to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the [[District of Columbia]] in [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)]]\n\n[[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]] engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on [[polyamory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uupa.org|title=UUPA website }}</ref> At the 2015 [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]], the Association's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of \"family and relationship structures\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |title=Unitarian Universalist Association: Rule II, Section C-2.3.: Non-discrimination |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103753/http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |archivedate=2015-05-18}}</ref> the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.\n\nMany congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and [[sustainability]].

The [[American Unitarian Conference]] and the [[Christian Universalist Association]] are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original [[American Unitarian Association]] or [[Universalist Church of America]], and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The [[Unity Church]] is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.<ref>See [http://www.americanunitarian.org/voicearticle.htm \"Why the American Unitarian Conference Had to Be Formed\"] and [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/unitarian.html \"What Is the Difference between Christian Universalism and Unitarian Universalism?\"]</ref>\n\n===Internal===\n\n====Language of reverence====\nDuring the presidency of William Sinkford, debate within the Unitarian Universalist movement roiled over his call to return to or create an authentic Unitarian Universalist \"language of reverence.\" Sinkford suggested that Unitarian Universalists abandoned traditional religious language, thereby abandoning words with potential power to others who will then dictate their meanings in the public sphere. He suggested that Unitarian Universalists regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. Others reacted to this call by believing it to be part of an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Sinkford denied this, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he means by the \"language of reverence.\" The growth of humanism in Unitarianism was determined by a desire to raise the profile to a universal audience, educating atheists and agnostics in biblical literacy among the wider congregation of Unitarian Universalists, many of whom were born into families that lacked the rigour of a moral catechism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uuworld.org/articles/need-language-reverence|title=Human reverence: The language of reverence is the language of humanity|date=2006-07-31|first=Kendyl L.R.|last=Gibbons|publisher=UU World: Liberal religion and life|accessdate=2017-12-26}}</ref>\nThe debate included the publication of a book by the UUA's [[Beacon Press]] written by former UUA President John Buehrens.<ref>{{cite web|last=Buehrens |first=John A. |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/132/story_13272_1.html |title=Past Unitarian Universalist Association President John A.

It provides interpretative strategies, so that Unitarian Universalists (among others) might be able to engage in public debate about what the Bible says from a liberal religious perspective, rather than relinquishing to religious conservatives, and other more literal interpretations, all control over the book's contents and significance in matters of public and civic import.

Having no choice but to take the women along, Captain Maitland (Guy Rolfe) must hide the girls presence from the admiral (Michael Hordern).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Guy Rolfe]] as Captain Alwin Maitland\n* [[Ronald Shiner]] as Marine Ogg\n* [[Alan White (actor)|Alan White]] as Commander\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as Admiral Reginald Victor Hewitt\t\n* [[Anne Kimbell]] as Mary Carlton\n* [[Nadine Tallier]] as Antoinette\n* [[Fabia Drake]] as Lady Kitty Hewitt\n* Mary Steele as Jill Eaton\n* [[Richard Coleman]] as Captain Robert 'Bobby' Randall\n* [[Lionel Jeffries]] as Harry, the Tourist\n* [[Teddy Johnson]] as Singer\n* [[Daniel Massey (actor)|Daniel Massey]] as Flag Lieutenant Courtney\n* [[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]] as Corporal Duckett\n* [[Warren Mitchell]] as Arthur\n* [[Michael Ripper]] as Jumper, Marine\n* Mercy Haystead as Claudine\n* [[Brian Wilde]] as Bill\n* [[Harold Goodwin (English actor)|Harold Goodwin]] as Wal\n* David Aylmer as Navigating Officer\n* [[Richard Briers]] as 'Popeye' Lewis\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe ''[[Radio Times]]'' wrote, \"The 1940s film version of the stage farce The Middle Watch, which starred [[Jack Buchanan]], was pretty bad, but beside this tepid remake it looks like a comedy classic. The cast does its level best to pep up the tired material...Ronald Shiner is cheeky and Michael Hordern is absent-mindedly authoritarian, but Guy Rolfe is as wooden as a figurehead, while all the girls get to do is rush around in a state of undress.
