Bingham, a 50\u20131 outsider at the start of the tournament, defeated Murphy 18\u201315 in the final to win the first world title of his 20-year professional career. At the age of 38, Bingham became the oldest player to win the title since [[Ray Reardon]] in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]].\n\nThe tournament featured a total of 86 [[century break]]s, a record for the championships and higher than 83 centuries set in [[2009 World Snooker Championship|2009]].

It was the 39th consecutive year that the [[World Snooker Championship]] had been held at the Crucible and this was the final [[Snooker world rankings|ranking]] event of the [[Snooker season 2014/2015|2014/2015 season]]. [[Betfred]] sponsored the event for the first time in three years, having previously sponsored the tournament from 2009 to 2012. Qualifying for the event took place between 8 and 15 April 2015 at the [[Ponds Forge International Sports Centre]], Sheffield.\n\n[[Mark Selby]] was the defending champion, having defeated [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] in the [[2014 World Snooker Championship|2014 final]]. Selby lost 9\u201313 in the second round to event debutant [[Anthony McGill (snooker player)|Anthony McGill]]. Selby fell to the [[Crucible curse]], becoming the 16th first-time champion unable to defend his title at the venue. [[Shaun Murphy]] the [[2005 World Snooker Championship|2005 winner]] met [[Stuart Bingham]] in the final. Bingham, a 50\u20131 outsider at the start of the tournament, defeated Murphy 18\u201315 in the final to win the first world title of his 20-year professional career. At the age of 38, Bingham became the oldest player to win the title since [[Ray Reardon]] in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]].\n\nThe tournament featured a total of 86 [[century break]]s, a record for the championships and higher than 83 centuries set in [[2009 World Snooker Championship|2009]]. The highest break was 145, achieved by both Bingham and [[Neil Robertson]]. The event had a prize fund of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]1,364,000 with the winner receiving \u00a3300,000.\n\n==Overview==\nThe [[World Snooker Championship]] is an annual [[cue sport]] tournament and the official professional world championship of the game of [[snooker]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Snooker championship |work=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer |date=11 May 1927 |accessdate=12 March 2019 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/19270511/425/0020 |via=British Newspaper Archive}}</ref> Founded in the late 19th century by [[British Army]] soldiers stationed in India,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snookerheritage.co.uk/normans-articles/days-of-old/origins-of-snooker/ |title=Origins of Snooker |first=Peter |last=Clare |year=2008 |work=Billiard & Snooker Heritage Collection |accessdate=8 February 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103150005/http://snookerheritage.co.uk/normans-articles/days-of-old/origins-of-snooker/ |archivedate=3 January 2017}}</ref> the sport was played in the United Kingdom.<ref>Everton, Clive (1991).

He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], August 28, 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practiced his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W.

He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research.

Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], August 28, 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practiced his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law.

Henson]]), a self-centered, [[alcoholic]] singer, performing at a nightclub where she works. On the other side of town, [[Madea (Mabel Simmons)|Madea]] ([[Tyler Perry]]) and Joe Simmons (Perry) catch Jennifer (Hope Olaid\u00e8 Wilson), Manny ([[Kwesi Boakye]]), and Byron (Freddy Siglar) breaking into their house. After hearing the children\u2019s troubles, Madea welcomes and feeds them. Manny tells Madea that they\u2019re living with their grandmother Rose, whom they haven't seen in four days and their mother is deceased. They tell her that their only other relative is their Aunt April.\n\nApril shares her home with her shady boyfriend, Randy ([[Brian J. White|Brian White]]), who\u2019s married with children. The next morning, Madea brings the kids to April's house, but April doesn\u2019t want to be bothered. Meanwhile, Pastor Brian ([[Marvin Winans]]) sends a Colombian immigrant named Sandino ([[Adam Rodr\u00edguez]]) to her house for work and a place to stay. April puts Sandino in her basement and wants to lock him down there because she doesn't know him that well. While working around the house, Sandino surprises April by cleaning himself up. When Randy arrives, he sees April with the kids and Sandino and heckles him while making subtle [[Child molestation|advances]] at Jennifer.\n\nShortly afterward, Pastor Brian and Wilma ([[Gladys Knight]]), a church member, come to inform April that her mother Rose died from a fatal [[Cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] while riding on a city bus. April is devastated by the news and seeks comfort from Randy; however, he is sleeping and shrugs her off. Later, Sandino comforts April as she tells him about her mother's death and the last time she spoke with her. Shortly afterwards Jennifer, Manny, and Byron return to April's after searching for their grandmother and April dejectedly tells them the news.\n\nDepressed, Jennifer goes to Madea wanting to know how to pray. However, Madea, inexperienced with prayer, attempts to instruct her in a scene that plays out comically. The same night, Tanya ([[Mary J. Blige]]), the nightclub bartender, sings \"''I Can Do Bad''\". Before singing the song, Tanya strongly confronts April about her attitude. She says that April must change her selfish ways and think about the safety of Byron, Manny and Jennifer. Tanya declares she loves April but says she can\u2019t help her unless she helps herself.\n\nOver time, Sandino and April become good friends, and Sandino fixes a ruined bedroom in her house. This makes Manny and Byron happy, but upsets Jennifer, who feels April does not want them there. While on a date, Sandino tells April he doesn't understand why she is with Randy and asks if she loves Randy. He tells her what true love is to him. One Sunday morning, Sandino eagerly knocks on April's bedroom door to get April ready for church, but Randy threatens to kill Sandino if he continues to spend time with April.\n\nLate the next night, Manny needs his insulin shot, and Jennifer goes to the kitchen to get it. As she prepares the shot, Randy approaches and attempts to [[rape]] her, but Sandino fights him off. April walks in on the fight and Randy claims Jennifer offered him sex for money. April pretends to believe him and sends Randy to take a bath. When he is in the tub, April threatens to [[electrocute]] him with a plugged-in radio. Sandino arrives and tries to stop her, but April is enraged, as she explains that she was [[sexually abused]] by her step-father, who then lied about it to her mother, thus causing April to lose her faith in the people that cared about her.  After saying does he want her to put it down twice, she drops the plugged-in radio into the water, giving Randy a severe [[electric shock]]. Randy barely jumps out just in time and Sandino orders him to leave.\n\nApril goes to the bar for a drink and blames herself for not seeing the signs, just like her mother didn't see the signs with her. Sandino tries to stop her from drinking, but she pushes him away. She then asks Sandino if he is a child molester, because of all the attention he gives the children. Sandino tells April of his childhood as a child laborer and explains that he loves the children so much because he sees himself in them. Feeling hurt at her unfair accusations, Sandino says farewell to the children and leaves.\n\nJennifer and April begin to get along and connect after April tells Jennifer about her bad experience as a child. Jennifer tells her that she should recognize Sandino as a good man. Eventually, Sandino returns and April apologizes to him and admits that she loves him like a friend. Sandino tells her that she can't love anyone until she learns to love herself. He tells April that he is in love with her but he wants April to love him back the same way he loves her. He shows her by kissing her.\n\nEventually, April and Sandino get married. April and Sandino then hold a block party for their reception with Tanya singing \"Good Woman Down\", dedicated to April, then the new couple is shown embracing and sharing a passionate kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- title cards -->\n* [[Taraji P.

In the film, several characters refer to Cora, but she is not seen; Mr. Brown is neither seen nor mentioned.\n* The original plot (in the stage play) focused on two sisters feuding because Maylee is engaged to her sister Vianne's ex-husband, Anthony, and Anthony is holding her back from her parental responsibilities. In the film, April's sister is a drug addict and thief who neglected her children and is deceased. Her mother assumed custody of the children but has recently disappeared without explanation, and circumstances have forced April to reluctantly take her niece and nephews in.\n* The stage play characters Vianne, Keisha, Bobby, Maylee, and Anthony do not exist in the film.\n\n==Music==\nThe film features 13 songs,<ref>[[Internet Movie Database]], https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1385912/soundtrack</ref> including two new songs by Blige.

Henson]]), a self-centered, [[alcoholic]] singer, performing at a nightclub where she works. On the other side of town, [[Madea (Mabel Simmons)|Madea]] ([[Tyler Perry]]) and Joe Simmons (Perry) catch Jennifer (Hope Olaid\u00e8 Wilson), Manny ([[Kwesi Boakye]]), and Byron (Freddy Siglar) breaking into their house. After hearing the children\u2019s troubles, Madea welcomes and feeds them. Manny tells Madea that they\u2019re living with their grandmother Rose, whom they haven't seen in four days and their mother is deceased. They tell her that their only other relative is their Aunt April.\n\nApril shares her home with her shady boyfriend, Randy ([[Brian J. White|Brian White]]), who\u2019s married with children. The next morning, Madea brings the kids to April's house, but April doesn\u2019t want to be bothered. Meanwhile, Pastor Brian ([[Marvin Winans]]) sends a Colombian immigrant named Sandino ([[Adam Rodr\u00edguez]]) to her house for work and a place to stay. April puts Sandino in her basement and wants to lock him down there because she doesn't know him that well. While working around the house, Sandino surprises April by cleaning himself up. When Randy arrives, he sees April with the kids and Sandino and heckles him while making subtle [[Child molestation|advances]] at Jennifer.\n\nShortly afterward, Pastor Brian and Wilma ([[Gladys Knight]]), a church member, come to inform April that her mother Rose died from a fatal [[Cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] while riding on a city bus. April is devastated by the news and seeks comfort from Randy; however, he is sleeping and shrugs her off. Later, Sandino comforts April as she tells him about her mother's death and the last time she spoke with her. Shortly afterwards Jennifer, Manny, and Byron return to April's after searching for their grandmother and April dejectedly tells them the news.\n\nDepressed, Jennifer goes to Madea wanting to know how to pray. However, Madea, inexperienced with prayer, attempts to instruct her in a scene that plays out comically. The same night, Tanya ([[Mary J. Blige]]), the nightclub bartender, sings \"''I Can Do Bad''\". Before singing the song, Tanya strongly confronts April about her attitude. She says that April must change her selfish ways and think about the safety of Byron, Manny and Jennifer. Tanya declares she loves April but says she can\u2019t help her unless she helps herself.\n\nOver time, Sandino and April become good friends, and Sandino fixes a ruined bedroom in her house. This makes Manny and Byron happy, but upsets Jennifer, who feels April does not want them there. While on a date, Sandino tells April he doesn't understand why she is with Randy and asks if she loves Randy. He tells her what true love is to him. One Sunday morning, Sandino eagerly knocks on April's bedroom door to get April ready for church, but Randy threatens to kill Sandino if he continues to spend time with April.\n\nLate the next night, Manny needs his insulin shot, and Jennifer goes to the kitchen to get it. As she prepares the shot, Randy approaches and attempts to [[rape]] her, but Sandino fights him off. April walks in on the fight and Randy claims Jennifer offered him sex for money. April pretends to believe him and sends Randy to take a bath. When he is in the tub, April threatens to [[electrocute]] him with a plugged-in radio. Sandino arrives and tries to stop her, but April is enraged, as she explains that she was [[sexually abused]] by her step-father, who then lied about it to her mother, thus causing April to lose her faith in the people that cared about her.  After saying does he want her to put it down twice, she drops the plugged-in radio into the water, giving Randy a severe [[electric shock]]. Randy barely jumps out just in time and Sandino orders him to leave.\n\nApril goes to the bar for a drink and blames herself for not seeing the signs, just like her mother didn't see the signs with her. Sandino tries to stop her from drinking, but she pushes him away. She then asks Sandino if he is a child molester, because of all the attention he gives the children. Sandino tells April of his childhood as a child laborer and explains that he loves the children so much because he sees himself in them. Feeling hurt at her unfair accusations, Sandino says farewell to the children and leaves.\n\nJennifer and April begin to get along and connect after April tells Jennifer about her bad experience as a child. Jennifer tells her that she should recognize Sandino as a good man. Eventually, Sandino returns and April apologizes to him and admits that she loves him like a friend. Sandino tells her that she can't love anyone until she learns to love herself. He tells April that he is in love with her but he wants April to love him back the same way he loves her. He shows her by kissing her.\n\nEventually, April and Sandino get married. April and Sandino then hold a block party for their reception with Tanya singing \"Good Woman Down\", dedicated to April, then the new couple is shown embracing and sharing a passionate kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- title cards -->\n* [[Taraji P.

In the film, several characters refer to Cora, but she is not seen; Mr. Brown is neither seen nor mentioned.\n* The original plot (in the stage play) focused on two sisters feuding because Maylee is engaged to her sister Vianne's ex-husband, Anthony, and Anthony is holding her back from her parental responsibilities. In the film, April's sister is a drug addict and thief who neglected her children and is deceased. Her mother assumed custody of the children but has recently disappeared without explanation, and circumstances have forced April to reluctantly take her niece and nephews in.\n* The stage play characters Vianne, Keisha, Bobby, Maylee, and Anthony do not exist in the film.\n\n==Music==\nThe film features 13 songs,<ref>[[Internet Movie Database]], https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1385912/soundtrack</ref> including two new songs by Blige. Perry was not able to produce a soundtrack album for the film due to the various record companies involved.<!-- blacklisted source <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.com/pop-culture-in-cleveland/no-i-can-do-bad-all-by-myself-movie-soundtrack-tyler-perry-says-only-individual-songs-for-sale|author=Paula Mooney|work=Cleveland Pop Culture Examiner|date=September 11, 2009|accessdate=October 27, 2011}}</ref>-->\n\n* \"Good Woman Down\" (Robert F.

It is also believed to be derived from the Creek Indian word for \u2018rock rising to a point.\u2019\n\nThe earliest Cherokee occupation of the area dates from 1776, when [[Dragging Canoe]] separated himself from the main tribe to establish resistance to European settlement during the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]]. In 1816 [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], who later became [[Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation|Principal Chief]], established [[Ross's Landing]]. Located along what is now Broad Street, it became one of the centers of Cherokee Nation settlement, which also extended into Georgia and Alabama.<ref name=tehc />\n\nIn 1838, the U.S. government forced the Cherokees, along with other Native Americans, to relocate to the area designated as [[Indian Territory]], in what is now the state of [[Oklahoma]]. Their journey west became known as the \"[[Trail of Tears]]\" for their exile and fatalities along the way. The U.S. Army used Ross's Landing as the site of one of three large internment camps, or \"emigration depots\", where Native Americans were held before the journey on the Trail of Tears.<ref name=vott>Vicki Rozema, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7zgcpmg8vcC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=trail+of+tears,+emigration+depots&source=bl&ots=jx60asMNZF&sig=GQuHws155HTp72arN8yGG1_otm8&hl=en&ei=vFCMSpazLcyBtgeJyMTkBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false Voices from the Trail of Tears].

The city grew quickly, initially benefiting from a location well-suited for river commerce. With the arrival of the railroad in 1850, Chattanooga became a boom town.

They were hired again on a permanent basis beginning on August 11, 1948, years before other major cities in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], such as [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi]], integrated their police departments. The first seven black officers in 1948, Thaddeus Arnold, Singer Askins, W.B. Baulridge, C.E.

The first part of the name \"Chattanooga\" derives from the [[Muskogean]] word ''cvto'' /ch\u1eaft\u022f/ \u2013 'rock'.<ref>A Dictionary of Creek/Muskogee, Margaret McKane Mauldin</ref> The latter may be derived from a regional suffix ''-nuga'' meaning dwelling or dwelling place. It is also believed to be derived from the Creek Indian word for \u2018rock rising to a point.\u2019\n\nThe earliest Cherokee occupation of the area dates from 1776, when [[Dragging Canoe]] separated himself from the main tribe to establish resistance to European settlement during the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]]. In 1816 [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], who later became [[Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation|Principal Chief]], established [[Ross's Landing]]. Located along what is now Broad Street, it became one of the centers of Cherokee Nation settlement, which also extended into Georgia and Alabama.<ref name=tehc />\n\nIn 1838, the U.S. government forced the Cherokees, along with other Native Americans, to relocate to the area designated as [[Indian Territory]], in what is now the state of [[Oklahoma]]. Their journey west became known as the \"[[Trail of Tears]]\" for their exile and fatalities along the way. The U.S. Army used Ross's Landing as the site of one of three large internment camps, or \"emigration depots\", where Native Americans were held before the journey on the Trail of Tears.<ref name=vott>Vicki Rozema, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7zgcpmg8vcC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=trail+of+tears,+emigration+depots&source=bl&ots=jx60asMNZF&sig=GQuHws155HTp72arN8yGG1_otm8&hl=en&ei=vFCMSpazLcyBtgeJyMTkBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false Voices from the Trail of Tears].

The city grew quickly, initially benefiting from a location well-suited for river commerce. With the arrival of the railroad in 1850, Chattanooga became a boom town.

The next day, the [[Battle of Lookout Mountain]] was fought, driving the Confederates off the mountain. On November 25, Grant's army routed the Confederates in the [[Battle of Missionary Ridge]]. In regard to victories won by the Union, Chattanooga marks one of three defining moments that turned the Civil War in their favor.

They were hired again on a permanent basis beginning on August 11, 1948, years before other major cities in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], such as [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi]], integrated their police departments. The first seven black officers in 1948, Thaddeus Arnold, Singer Askins, W.B. Baulridge, C.E.
