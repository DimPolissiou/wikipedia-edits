{"title_page": "La Maestra", "text_new": "{{orphan|date=April 2012}}\n\n'''''La Maestra''''' (i.e., \"The Schoolteacher\" in English) is a [[Latin American]] play written in 1968 by the [[Colombia]]n playwright, Enrique Buenaventura (1925\u20132003). It is the first in his series of small one act plays, ''Los Papeles Del Infierno'' [The Roles of Hell].\n\n==Plot==\nThe play tells the story of a Colombian [[schoolteacher]], La Maestra, who is dead. This creates an eerie, dreamlike quality to the play.  Each character she speaks to in the play is someone who has held importance in her past.  In the beginning she is seated on a bench and the characters she interacts with do not see her, just as she does not see them. The play opens with the teacher describing the rain in the town and how everything becomes red and muddy. The play ends after the teacher is [[rape]]d by army sergeants; she cannot eat because of the traumatizing experience and it begins to rain again.\n\n==Characters==\nLa Maestra is the main character. She \u201cconverses\u201d one-sidedly with each of the following characters. In the beginning, she states that she is dead and describes where she used to live&mdash;in a house made of red clay with a straw roof. She grew up in a small town called \u201cHope\u201d which was named by her father. She truly cares for the children whom she teaches; when she doesn\u2019t eat she is thinking of the children. She teaches them the history of their country, Colombia.\n\n*Juana Pasamb\u00fa: This is the schoolteachers\u2019 aunt. She is the first person who replies to the schoolteacher. She questions why La Maestra lost her [[appetite]].\n*Pedro Pasamb\u00fa: This character is the schoolteachers\u2019 uncle. After the schoolteacher tells Pedros\u2019 wife that she can\u2019t eat because she lost her appetite, he replies by recalling that she liked to eat bananas and corn on the cob with salt and butter. He is the second person who converses with the schoolteacher.\n*Tob\u00edas el Tuerto: (i.e., \"Squint-Eyed Tobias\" in English) He was the [[mayor]] who preceded her father. He says that he brought La Maestra water from the spring where she drank when she was a child and goes on to say that the Maestra refused to drink the water.\n*La Vieja Asunci\u00f3n: This is the [[midwife]] who delivered La Maestra into the world. She wails inquisitive remarks about why the schoolteacher wouldn\u2019t take things from her and why the schoolteacher spit out the soup she offered her. All the while, there is a [[funeral]] procession occurring while the midwife is expressing her concerns to the schoolteacher. She refers to La Maestra as \u201cmy child\u201d.\n*Sargento:  This character is the police sergeant. He acts as though he is superior to the other characters. He is the character to whom La Maestra speaks with the most during the play. After the funeral procession, the sergeant confers with Peregrino Pasamb\u00fa, the schoolteacher\u2019s father, who makes is appearance on his knees. While the sergeant looks down on Peregrino Pasamb\u00fa, he refers to him as \u201cthe big chief here\u201d, because La Maestra\u2019s father is the current mayor of the town. Because the sergeant is standing and Peregrino Pasamb\u00fa is on his knees, the sergeant has power over the mayor. Peregrino Pasamb\u00fa never replies to the sergeant\u2019s statements or questions; he doesn\u2019t have any lines in the play; the schoolteacher replies for him. The sergeant asks if the schoolteacher\u2019s father got his land because of politics, to which the school teacher recounts that this was not the case; her father got their land because he was one of the founders of the town. The sergeant says that he is going to overrun the town and redistribute the land because \u201cthis land ain\u2019t divided right.\u201d He represents the authoritative power that the military held during this time in Colombian history. To this, the schoolteacher says that when her father assumed power as mayor, \u201cthe town was a jungle.\u201d The sergeant complains to her father that the jobs weren\u2019t distributed properly either, and proceeds to ask him if his daughter is the schoolteacher. La Maestra responds to him by saying that she was indeed the schoolteacher and she taught the child [[catechism]] and the country\u2019s history. The sergeant grows angry at the schoolteacher and says that he was given orders to reassess and reorganize the town. He shoots Peregrino Pasamb\u00fa and he and other soldiers subsequently rape La Maestra.\n*El Viejo or Peregrino Pasamb\u00fa: This is La Maestras\u2019 father. He is spoken to by the police sergeant, but doesn\u2019t reply. Anything spoken to Peregrino Pasamb\u00fa from the police sergeant is replied to by La Maestra. He helped assemble the town and land where La Maestra has lived her entire life. He is shot by the police sergeant.\n\n==Themes==\nThe play deals with the ideas of life and death and how they are intertwined. A major theme is family and how it relates to tradition and culture. La Maestra was the schoolteacher in the town where she lived, and before that her mother was the first schoolteacher of the town; her mother taught her how to be a teacher and then La Maestra became a teacher just as her mother had done before her. Political themes linked to the play include the military and the government. Social themes in the play are [[violence]] and rape. The military [[dictatorship]] during the 1960s used excessive force as well as violence when they encroached upon towns, as they did in the town of \u201cHope\u201d.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*\"\"LA MAESTRA\" : GUI\u00d3N DRAM\u00c1TICO.\" VNIVERSITAS.

He became a citizen in 1890 and earned a [[medical degree]] in 1892 from what is now [[George Washington University]]. Throughout his life, he strove to educate Koreans in the ideals of freedom and [[democracy]], and pressed the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] for [[Korean independence movement|Korean independence]]. He died during the [[Korean War]]. His home is now a museum, cared for by a social services organization founded in his name in 1975.\n\nA prominent figure among the Korean immigrant community is [[Ahn Chang Ho]], [[pen name]] Dosan, a [[Protestant]] social [[activist]]. He came to the United States in 1902 for education. He founded the Friendship Society in 1903 and the Mutual Assistance Society. He was also a political activist during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]]. There is a memorial built in his honor in downtown [[Riverside, California]] and his family home on 36th Place in Los Angeles has been restored by [[University of Southern California]]. The City of Los Angeles has also declared the nearby intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Van Buren Place to be \"Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Square\" in his honor. The [[Taekwondo]] pattern Do-san was named after him.\n[[File:Korean-American-1918-football.jpg|thumb|Korean-American football player in [[Chicago]], 1918]]\n\nAnother prominent figure among the Korean immigrant community was [[Syngman Rhee]] (\uc774\uc2b9\ub9cc), a Methodist.{{ref|identification5}} He came to the United States in 1904 and earned a [[bachelor's degree]] at George Washington University in 1907, a master's degree at [[Harvard University]], and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1910. In 1910, he returned to Korea and became a political activist. He later became the first [[president of the Republic of Korea]].\n\nIn 1903, the first group of Korean laborers came to [[Hawaii]] on January 13, now known annually as ''Korean-American Day'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/North_Jersey_Korean_Americans_celebrate_another_year_of_communitys_emergence.html|title=North Jersey Korean Americans celebrate another year of community's emergence|author=Monsy Alvarado|publisher=North Jersey Media Group|date=January 13, 2014|accessdate=January 13, 2014}}</ref> to fill in gaps created by problems with [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] laborers.

[[Picture bride]]s became a common practice for marriage to Korean men.\n\nBetween 1905 and 1910, political activities in Korean American communities surged in opposition towards Japanese aggression towards Korea. Organizations formed throughout the US, much of which was concentrated in Hawaii and California. In 1909, two of the largest Korean-American organizations would merge to form the [[Korean National Association]], the largest Korean immigrant organization in North America. Leaders included An Changho, Syngman Rhee, and [[Park Yong-man]]. This organization along with others would play key roles in the [[Korean independence movement]] between 1910 and 1945.\n\nAfter the annexation of [[Korea]] by [[Japan]] in 1910, Korean migration to the United States was virtually halted. The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] or sometimes referred to as the ''Oriental Exclusion Act'' was part of a measured system excluding Korean immigrants into the US. In 1952 with the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]], opportunities were more open to [[Asian Americans]], enabling Korean Americans to move out of enclaves into middle-class neighborhoods. When the [[Korean War]] ended in 1953, small numbers of students and professionals entered the United States. A larger group of immigrants included women married with [[USFK|U.S. servicemen]]. With the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], Koreans became one of the fastest growing Asian groups in the United States, surpassed only by [[Filipino American|Filipinos]].\n\nThe [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] abolished the quota system that had restricted the numbers of Asians allowed to enter the United States. Large numbers of Koreans, including some from North Korea who had come via South Korea, have been immigrating ever since, putting Korea in the top six countries of origin of immigrants to the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/yearbook-immigration-statistics-2013-lawful-permanent-residents|title=Yearbook of Immigration Statistics: 2013 Lawful Permanent Residents Supplemental Table 1|publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}</ref> since 1975. The reasons for immigration are many including the desire for increased [[Liberty|freedom]] and the hope for better economic opportunities.\n\n[[File:Korean Americans.jpg|thumb|left|A wide range of Korean Americans]]\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Koreans became noted not only for starting small businesses such as dry cleaners or convenience stores, but also for diligently planting churches. They would venture into abandoned cities and start up businesses which happened to be predominantly African American in demographics. This would sometimes lead to publicized tensions with customers as dramatized in movies such as Spike Lee's ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots of April 1992]].\n\nTheir children, along with those of other Asian Americans, would also be noted in headlines and magazine covers in the 1980s for their numbers in [[Ivy League|prestigious universities]] and highly skilled [[white-collar worker|white collar]] professions. Favorable [[socioeconomic status]] and [[Education in the United States|education]] have led to the painting of Asian groups such as the Koreans as a \"[[model minority]]\". Throughout the 1980s until today, Korean Americans and other East Asian groups continue to attend prestigious universities in high numbers and make up a large percentage of the professional white collar work force including such fields as medicine, law, computer science, finance, and investment banking.\n\n[[File:Juju_Chang.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Juju Chang]] is an American [[television journalist]] for [[ABC News]], and currently serves as an anchor of ''[[Nightline]]''.]]\nLos Angeles has emerged as a major center of the Korean American community.

He became a citizen in 1890 and earned a [[medical degree]] in 1892 from what is now [[George Washington University]]. Throughout his life, he strove to educate Koreans in the ideals of freedom and [[democracy]], and pressed the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] for [[Korean independence movement|Korean independence]]. He died during the [[Korean War]]. His home is now a museum, cared for by a social services organization founded in his name in 1975.\n\nA prominent figure among the Korean immigrant community is [[Ahn Chang Ho]], [[pen name]] Dosan, a [[Protestant]] social [[activist]]. He came to the United States in 1902 for education. He founded the Friendship Society in 1903 and the Mutual Assistance Society. He was also a political activist during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]]. There is a memorial built in his honor in downtown [[Riverside, California]] and his family home on 36th Place in Los Angeles has been restored by [[University of Southern California]]. The City of Los Angeles has also declared the nearby intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Van Buren Place to be \"Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Square\" in his honor. The [[Taekwondo]] pattern Do-san was named after him.\n[[File:Korean-American-1918-football.jpg|thumb|Korean-American football player in [[Chicago]], 1918]]\n\nAnother prominent figure among the Korean immigrant community was [[Syngman Rhee]] (\uc774\uc2b9\ub9cc), a Methodist.{{ref|identification5}} He came to the United States in 1904 and earned a [[bachelor's degree]] at George Washington University in 1907, a master's degree at [[Harvard University]], and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1910. In 1910, he returned to Korea and became a political activist.

[[Picture bride]]s became a common practice for marriage to Korean men.\n\nBetween 1905 and 1910, political activities in Korean American communities surged in opposition towards Japanese aggression towards Korea. Organizations formed throughout the US, much of which was concentrated in Hawaii and California. In 1909, two of the largest Korean-American organizations would merge to form the [[Korean National Association]], the largest Korean immigrant organization in North America. Leaders included An Changho, Syngman Rhee, and [[Park Yong-man]]. This organization along with others would play key roles in the [[Korean independence movement]] between 1910 and 1945.\n\nAfter the annexation of [[Korea]] by [[Japan]] in 1910, Korean migration to the United States was virtually halted. The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] or sometimes referred to as the ''Oriental Exclusion Act'' was part of a measured system excluding Korean immigrants into the US. In 1952 with the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]], opportunities were more open to [[Asian Americans]], enabling Korean Americans to move out of enclaves into middle-class neighborhoods. When the [[Korean War]] ended in 1953, small numbers of students and professionals entered the United States. A larger group of immigrants included women married with [[USFK|U.S. servicemen]]. With the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], Koreans became one of the fastest growing Asian groups in the United States, surpassed only by [[Filipino American|Filipinos]].\n\nThe [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] abolished the quota system that had restricted the numbers of Asians allowed to enter the United States. Large numbers of Koreans, including some from North Korea who had come via South Korea, have been immigrating ever since, putting Korea in the top six countries of origin of immigrants to the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/yearbook-immigration-statistics-2013-lawful-permanent-residents|title=Yearbook of Immigration Statistics: 2013 Lawful Permanent Residents Supplemental Table 1|publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}</ref> since 1975. The reasons for immigration are many including the desire for increased [[Liberty|freedom]] and the hope for better economic opportunities.\n\n[[File:Korean Americans.jpg|thumb|left|A wide range of Korean Americans]]\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Koreans became noted not only for starting small businesses such as dry cleaners or convenience stores, but also for diligently planting churches. They would venture into abandoned cities and start up businesses which happened to be predominantly African American in demographics. This would sometimes lead to publicized tensions with customers as dramatized in movies such as Spike Lee's ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots of April 1992]].\n\nTheir children, along with those of other Asian Americans, would also be noted in headlines and magazine covers in the 1980s for their numbers in [[Ivy League|prestigious universities]] and highly skilled [[white-collar worker|white collar]] professions. Favorable [[socioeconomic status]] and [[Education in the United States|education]] have led to the painting of Asian groups such as the Koreans as a \"[[model minority]]\". Throughout the 1980s until today, Korean Americans and other East Asian groups continue to attend prestigious universities in high numbers and make up a large percentage of the professional white collar work force including such fields as medicine, law, computer science, finance, and investment banking.\n\n[[File:Juju_Chang.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Juju Chang]] is an American [[television journalist]] for [[ABC News]], and currently serves as an anchor of ''[[Nightline]]''.]]\nLos Angeles has emerged as a major center of the Korean American community.

The \"liberals\" sought to unite with other minorities in Los Angeles to fight against racial oppression and scapegoating. The \"conservatives,\" emphasized [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] and generally favored the economic and social policies of the Republican Party.

His three other siblings died during childbirth. O'Connor said it \"marred my childhood and it's still haunting.\"\n\nO'Connor's mother was extremely possessive of her youngest son, not allowing him to cross the street on his own until he turned 13 and a typical  stagemother, often striking him.\n\nO'Connor later said regarding Effie, \"She wanted me to be as great as I possibly could be. She did her best.\"\n\n==Career==\n===O'Connor Family===\nO'Connor joined a dance act with his mother and elder brother Jack. They were billed as the O'Connor Family, the Royal Family of Vaudeville. They toured the country doing singing, dancing, comedy, and acting. \"Our entire family composed an act\", he says. \"We really didn't have a choice; if you were in the family you appeared in the act. I loved vaudeville. The live audiences created a certain spontaneity.\"<ref name=\"trib\"/>\n\nWhen they did not tour they stayed with O'Connor's Uncle Bill in Danville, Illinois.

I looked like the world's greatest dancer. I did triple wings and everything. But I had never had any formal training. So, when I went into movies and started working with all those great dancers, I had a terrible time. I couldn't pick up routines because I didn't have any formal training. At the age of 15 -- from 15 on, I really had to learn to dance. And that's quite old for someone to start dancing real heavy, professionally.\"<ref name=\"out\"/>\n\nO'Connor began performing in movies in 1937, making his debut aged 11 in ''[[Melody for Two]]'' appearing with his family act. He was also in Columbia's ''[[It Can't Last Forever]]'' (1937).<ref name=\"show\"/>\n\n===Paramount===\nO'Connor signed a contract at Paramount. He appeared in ''[[Men with Wings]]'' (1938), directed by [[William Wellman]], as [[Fred MacMurray]]'s character as a boy.

He made ''[[It Comes Up Love]]'' (1942) with Jean but without Ryan.\n\nO'Connor, Jean and Ryan were in ''[[Mister Big (1943 film)|Mister Big]]'' (1943). Before this film was released, O'Connor's popularity soared.  Universal added $50,000 in musical numbers to the film and promoted the \"B\" movie to \"A\" status.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[File:Donald O'Connor (handprints in cement).jpg|thumb|left|267px|O'Connor's handprints in front of [[The Great Movie Ride]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] theme park]]\nO'Connor and Ryan were in ''[[Top Man (film)|Top Man]]'' (1943), with [[Susanna Foster]], and ''[[Chip Off the Old Block]]'' (1944), with [[Ann Blyth]]. O'Connor and Ryan both had cameos in Universal's all-star ''[[Follow the Boys]]'' (1944).\n\nDuring [[World War II]], on his 18th birthday in August 1943, O'Connor was drafted into the [[United States Army]].  Before he reported for induction on February 6, 1944, Universal already had four O'Connor films completed. They rushed production to complete four more by that date, all with Ryan: ''[[This Is the Life (1944 film)|This Is the Life]]'' (1944), with Foster; ''[[The Merry Monahans]]'' (1944), with Blyth and [[Jack Oakie]]; ''[[Bowery to Broadway]]'' (1945), another all-star effort where O'Connor had a cameo; and ''[[Patrick the Great]]'' (1945).\n\nWith a backlog of seven features, deferred openings kept O'Connor's screen presence uninterrupted during the two years he was overseas in the Air Corps. Later moved to Special Unit in the Air Corps.\n\n===Return from war service===\nUniversal did not know what to do with their teen star turned young adult for one year. O'Connor was almost broke. A merger in 1946 had reorganized the studio as Universal-International. The studio paired O'Connor opposite their biggest female star, [[Deanna Durbin]], in ''[[Something in the Wind]]'' (1947).\n\nHe starred in ''[[Are You with It?]]'' (1948) with [[Olga San Juan]], ''[[Feudin', Fussin' and A-Fightin']]'' (1949) with [[Marjorie Main]] and [[Percy Kilbride]], and ''[[Yes Sir, That's My Baby (film)|Yes Sir, That's My Baby]]'' (1949) with [[Gloria De Haven]].<ref>DONALD O'CONNOR, MISS MAIN SET COMEDY PACE G K.

It was just oh -- so laborious for me. I didn't have a short cut like the other dancers do.\"<ref name=\"out\"/>\n\n\n===''Francis''===\nIn 1949, O'Connor played the lead role in ''[[Francis (1950 film)|Francis]]'', the story of a soldier befriended by a talking mule. Directed by [[Arthur Lubin]], the film was a huge success. As a consequence, his musical career was constantly interrupted by production of one ''Francis'' film per year until 1955. O'Connor later said the films \"were fun to make. Actually, they were quite challenging. I had to play straight in order to convince the audience that the mule could talk.\"<ref>Donald O'Connor's musical Journey keeps him on road\nDale, Steve. Chicago Tribune 20 Dec 1985: n_a50.</ref>\n\nO'Connor followed the first ''Francis'' with comedies: ''[[Curtain Call at Cactus Creek]]'' (1950), ''[[The Milkman]]'' (1950), and ''[[Double Crossbones]]'' (1951).\n\nHe did ''[[Francis Goes to the Races]]'' (1951), another big hit. In February 1951 he signed a new contract with Universal for one film a year for four years, enabling him to work outside the studio.<ref>{{cite news|title=Drama: Howard Duff Will Soon Starr in 'Cave'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=9 Feb 1951|page= B10}}</ref>\n\n===''Singin' in the Rain''===\nO'Connor received an offer to play Cosmo the piano player in ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. This earned him a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy or Musical. The film featured his widely known rendition of \"[[Make 'Em Laugh]],\" completely improvised. O'Connor composed the music for the famous scene at the last minute.\n\nO'Connor said \" all hoofers, they dance from the waist down. And I had to learn to dance from the waist up. And then, I became what's known as a total dancer.\"<ref name=\"out\"/>\n\nO'Connor said he was forced to go to the hospital during the production of Singin' in the Rain due to injuries and exhaustion.\n\n\"The scene was building to such a crescendo, I thought I'd actually have to kill myself,\" said O'Connor. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eviltwinltd.com/muppetlabs/oconnor/donald.htm|title=Donald O'Connor Web Site|first=Teresa and Tracy Ann Murray, T 'n'|last=T|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952 O'Connor signed a three-picture deal with Paramount.<ref>PARAMOUNT SIGNS DONALD O'CONNOR: Actor Will Make 3 Pictures for Studio -- Betty Hutton's Film May Be One of Them By THOMAS M.

I looked like the world's greatest dancer. I did triple wings and everything. But I had never had any formal training. So, when I went into movies and started working with all those great dancers, I had a terrible time. I couldn't pick up routines because I didn't have any formal training. At the age of 15 -- from 15 on, I really had to learn to dance.

O'Connor and Ryan both had cameos in Universal's all-star ''[[Follow the Boys]]'' (1944).\n\nDuring [[World War II]], on his 18th birthday in August 1943, O'Connor was drafted into the [[United States Army]].  Before he reported for induction on February 6, 1944, Universal already had four O'Connor films completed. They rushed production to complete four more by that date, all with Ryan: ''[[This Is the Life (1944 film)|This Is the Life]]'' (1944), with Foster; ''[[The Merry Monahans]]'' (1944), with Blyth and [[Jack Oakie]]; ''[[Bowery to Broadway]]'' (1945), another all-star effort where O'Connor had a cameo; and ''[[Patrick the Great]]'' (1945).\n\nWith a backlog of seven features, deferred openings kept O'Connor's screen presence uninterrupted during the two years he was overseas in the Air Corps. Later moved to Special Unit in the Air Corps.\n\n===Return from war service===\nUniversal did not know what to do with their teen star turned young adult for one year. O'Connor was almost broke. A merger in 1946 had reorganized the studio as Universal-International. The studio paired O'Connor opposite their biggest female star, [[Deanna Durbin]], in ''[[Something in the Wind]]'' (1947).\n\nHe starred in ''[[Are You with It?]]'' (1948) with [[Olga San Juan]], ''[[Feudin', Fussin' and A-Fightin']]'' (1949) with [[Marjorie Main]] and [[Percy Kilbride]], and ''[[Yes Sir, That's My Baby (film)|Yes Sir, That's My Baby]]'' (1949) with [[Gloria De Haven]].<ref>DONALD O'CONNOR, MISS MAIN SET COMEDY PACE G K.

Directed by [[Arthur Lubin]], the film was a huge success. As a consequence, his musical career was constantly interrupted by production of one ''Francis'' film per year until 1955. O'Connor later said the films \"were fun to make. Actually, they were quite challenging.
