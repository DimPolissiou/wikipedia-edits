Viju changes his name to Joshua Carlton and he successfully captures devotion of masses by being a good entertainer. Both Solomon and Issac make millions of dollars and their enterprise grew across countries with more than 300 major centers.\n\nHowever, things start to fall apart when Joshua agrees for an interview with Mathews in a secular TV channel. Mathews asks Joshua to do a miracle live on TV. Joshua mixes a drug to reduce Blood pressure and Mathews collapses live on TV. This was initially hailed as a miracle by all but later when the blood results come out, everyone got to know that it was because Mathews was drugged. This ends up in a fight between Joshua and Isaac and Soloman hits Joshua with a Golf Club. Joshua is hospitalised due to severe head injuries. Even after two days, Joshua failed to show any sign of improvement and they leave him to die. Solomon tries to hire a replacement but then Joshua manages to recover and gets back to business.\n\nBut now Joshua tries to take things in his own hand. He said he needs 80% profit in the business. Joshua's mental health also begins to deteriorate. Both Solomon and Issac sees this and tries to eliminate him. Solomon replaces Joshua's manager with Ester with the aim of drugging him to death.\n\nMeanwhile, a poor man named Thomas, who is a big fan of the pastor tries to cure his daughter's fever through prayers. He was hoping for a miracle cure, but ultimately his daughter dies due to the fever. This devastates Joshua. He confesses before Thomas that everything is fake. Joshua as an endgame tries to publicize the truth through Mathews. Solomon kills Mathews but still, Mathews manages to air the video that Joshua gave him. The truth is publicized and Joshua gets acquitted from his crimes due to his mental health. Avarachan dies due to a stroke when the video gets aired. Thomas kills Soloman and Isaac as revenge for cheating him.\n\nIn the end, Joshua goes to meet Esther and someone who he has grown close during his ministry tours and mental health crisis. Joshua gets to know that Ester is in Amsterdam through the letters that he got while he was in a mental asylum. The movie ends when they both meet.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Fahadh Faasil]] as Viju Prasad / Pastor Joshua Carlton\n* [[Gautham Menon]] as Solomon Davis\n* [[Nazriya Nazim]] as Esther Lopez\n* [[Dileesh Pothan]] as Avarachan\n* [[Soubin Shahir]] as Mathew Varghese\n* [[Chemban Vinod Jose]] as Issac Thomas\n* [[Vinayakan]] as Thomas\n* [[Sreenath Bhasi]] as Kunjan, Vijus's brother\n* [[Jinu Joseph]] as Dr. Jase John\n* [[Srinda Arhaan]] as Latha\n* [[Aswathi Menon]] as Kavitha\n* Arjun Ashokan as Paul\n* [[Dharmajan Bolgatty]] as Soji\n* Amalda Liz as Sheeba, Thomas' wife\n* [[Unnimaya Prasad]] as Shani, news reporter  \n* [[Joju George]] as News reader\n* Arushi Mudgal as Viju\u2019s and Kunjan's mother\n* Dilan as young Viju\n* Dian as young Kunjan\n* Anu K.

Viju lost his parents at a very young age and was left with his younger brother. Viju's brother was not mentally stable and was suicidal. Despite his best efforts, he could not take care of his brother well who gives up his life one day. Devastated, Viju relocated to Mumbai because everything in his home in Kanyakumari was reminding him of his brother and childhood.  \n\nIn Mumbai, he meets a casting director whom he has once met in Kanyakumari. She introduces him to Soloman Davis and Isaac Thomas. Viju gets hired by Solomon and Issac for their corporate body to work as a Christian [[pastor]] and is given six months of training in the gimmicks by Avarachan. Viju changes his name to Joshua Carlton and he successfully captures devotion of masses by being a good entertainer. Both Solomon and Issac make millions of dollars and their enterprise grew across countries with more than 300 major centers.\n\nHowever, things start to fall apart when Joshua agrees for an interview with Mathews in a secular TV channel. Mathews asks Joshua to do a miracle live on TV. Joshua mixes a drug to reduce Blood pressure and Mathews collapses live on TV. This was initially hailed as a miracle by all but later when the blood results come out, everyone got to know that it was because Mathews was drugged. This ends up in a fight between Joshua and Isaac and Soloman hits Joshua with a Golf Club. Joshua is hospitalised due to severe head injuries. Even after two days, Joshua failed to show any sign of improvement and they leave him to die. Solomon tries to hire a replacement but then Joshua manages to recover and gets back to business.\n\nBut now Joshua tries to take things in his own hand. He said he needs 80% profit in the business. Joshua's mental health also begins to deteriorate. Both Solomon and Issac sees this and tries to eliminate him. Solomon replaces Joshua's manager with Ester with the aim of drugging him to death.\n\nMeanwhile, a poor man named Thomas, who is a big fan of the pastor tries to cure his daughter's fever through prayers. He was hoping for a miracle cure, but ultimately his daughter dies due to the fever. This devastates Joshua. He confesses before Thomas that everything is fake. Joshua as an endgame tries to publicize the truth through Mathews. Solomon kills Mathews but still, Mathews manages to air the video that Joshua gave him. The truth is publicized and Joshua gets acquitted from his crimes due to his mental health. Avarachan dies due to a stroke when the video gets aired. Thomas kills Soloman and Isaac as revenge for cheating him.\n\nIn the end, Joshua goes to meet Esther and someone who he has grown close during his ministry tours and mental health crisis. Joshua gets to know that Ester is in Amsterdam through the letters that he got while he was in a mental asylum. The movie ends when they both meet.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Fahadh Faasil]] as Viju Prasad / Pastor Joshua Carlton\n* [[Gautham Menon]] as Solomon Davis\n* [[Nazriya Nazim]] as Esther Lopez\n* [[Dileesh Pothan]] as Avarachan\n* [[Soubin Shahir]] as Mathew Varghese\n* [[Chemban Vinod Jose]] as Issac Thomas\n* [[Vinayakan]] as Thomas\n* [[Sreenath Bhasi]] as Kunjan, Vijus's brother\n* [[Jinu Joseph]] as Dr. Jase John\n* [[Srinda Arhaan]] as Latha\n* [[Aswathi Menon]] as Kavitha\n* Arjun Ashokan as Paul\n* [[Dharmajan Bolgatty]] as Soji\n* Amalda Liz as Sheeba, Thomas' wife\n* [[Unnimaya Prasad]] as Shani, news reporter  \n* [[Joju George]] as News reader\n* Arushi Mudgal as Viju\u2019s and Kunjan's mother\n* Dilan as young Viju\n* Dian as young Kunjan\n* Anu K.

Eventually, Israeli independence was achieved following the liquidation of the former British-administered Mandate of Palestine, the departure of the British and the \"Independence War\" between the Jews in ex-[[Mandatory Palestine]] and five Arab states' armies. The Jewish claim to Palestine as a [[Jewish homeland]] can be seen as an example of irredentist reclamation of what is considered lost Jewish land by Zionists. These claims are based on ancestral inhabitance (and in some periods sovereignty) in the land and the cultural/religious significance of it in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The latter is particularly relevant to the Israeli claim to Jerusalem. [[Mandatory Palestine]] had sizable [[History of the Jews in Palestine|Jewish]] and [[Palestinians|Arab]] populations before the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], as they are called in the Bible, were part of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] (designated the [[West Bank]] by Jordan in 1947) and the [[Gaza Strip]], previously annexed by Jordan and occupied by Egypt respectively, were conquered and occupied by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005; Judea and Samaria (West Bank) remain under Israeli control. Israel has never explicitly claimed sovereignty over any part of the West Bank apart from [[East Jerusalem]], which it unilaterally annexed in 1980. However, the Israeli military supports and defends hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who have [[Israeli settlements|migrated]] to the West Bank, incurring criticism by some who otherwise support Israel. The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, and some countries and international organizations continue to regard Israel as occupying Gaza. ''(See [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-Occupied Territories]])''\n\n[[File:Israel and occupied territories map.png|thumb|Israel and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]]]\nThe Israeli annexing instrument, the [[Jerusalem Law]]\u2014one of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] (Israel does not have a constitution)\u2014declares Jerusalem, \"complete and united\", to be the capital of Israel. Article 3 of the Basic Law of the [[Palestinian Authority]], which was ratified in 2002 by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and serves as an interim constitution, claims that \"[[Jerusalem]] is the capital of Palestine\". ''De facto'', the Palestinian government administers the parts of the [[West Bank]] that Israel has granted it authority over from [[Ramallah]], while the [[Gaza Strip]] is administered by [[Hamas|the Hamas movement]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]].\n\nThe United States did not recognize Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem until 2017. In Jerusalem, the United States maintained two Consulates General as a diplomatic representation to the city of Jerusalem alone, separate from representation to the state of Israel. One of the Consulates General was established before the 1967 war, and the other in a recently constructed building on the Israeli side of Jerusalem. Moreover, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] in 1995 that says the US shall move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but allows the [[President of the United States|president]] to delay the move every year if it is deemed contrary to national security interests. From 1995 to 2017, every president delayed the move. However, President [[Donald Trump]] in December 2017 declared his intention to move the embassy to Jerusalem and in May 2018 the embassy officially did so.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Landler |date=6 December 2017 |title=Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html}}</ref>\n\nA number of Israelis and Jews regard the [[Transjordan (region)|East Bank of the Jordan river]] (which is today the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]]) as the eastern parts of the [[Land of Israel]] (following the [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist]] idea) because, according to the Bible, the [[Tribes of Israel|Israelite tribes]] of [[Tribe of Manasseh|Menasseh]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]] settled on the east bank of the Jordan, and allege that the area was designated a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish national home]] by the [[League of Nations]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] based upon the recognized historical connection of the Jewish people to the land.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Cited as an explicit basis not to create, but to reconstitute the historical homeland of the Jewish people as a nation-state roughly analogous to the former Kingdom of Israel subject to change by treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance or other lawful means, it forms a basis for claims of sovereign jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Japan===\n{{main|Japanese nationalism}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\nJapan claims the two southernmost islands of the [[Russia]]n-administered [[Kuril Islands]], the island chain north of [[Hokkaido]], annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] following World War II.

This state did not include [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised six counties in the north-east of the island of [[Ireland]] which remained in the United Kingdom. When the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was adopted in 1937 it provided that the name of the state is ''Ireland'' and this is considered the time that the Republic of Ireland became a fully fledged independent nation. In the constitution [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]] provided that \"[t]he national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland\", while stipulating that \"[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory\", the powers of the state were restricted to legislate only for the area which had formed part of the [[Irish Free State]]. Arising from the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], the matter was mutually resolved as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s constitution was altered by [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|referendum]] and its territorial claim to [[Northern Ireland]] was removed.\n\nThe amended constitution asserts that while it is the entitlement of \"every person born in the island of Ireland \u2026 to be part of the Irish Nation\" and to hold Irish citizenship, \"a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island\". A [[North/South Ministerial Council]] was created between the two jurisdictions and given executive authority. The advisory and consultative role of the government of Ireland in the government of Northern Ireland granted by the United Kingdom, that had begun with the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], was maintained, although that Agreement itself was ended. The two states also settled the long-running [[Names of the Irish state|dispute concerning their respective names]]: ''Ireland'' and the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', with both governments agreeing to use those names.\n\nUnder the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory of [[Irish republican legitimism|legitimism]], the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1916 was in existence from then on, denying the legitimacy of either the state of Ireland or the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Through much of its [[history of Sinn F\u00e9in|history]], this was the position of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]; however, it effectively abandoned this stance after accepting the Good Friday Agreement. Small groups which split from Sinn F\u00e9in continue to adopt this stance, including [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], linked with the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], linked with the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]].\n\n==Historic, theoretical and fringe irredentistic claims==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n {{recentism|section|date=February 2018}}\n {{split section|date=February 2018}}\n}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nIrredentism is commonplace in [[Africa]] due to the political boundaries of former European colonial nation-states passing through ethnic boundaries, and recent declarations of independence after civil war. For example, some Ethiopian nationalist circles still claim the former Ethiopian province of [[Eritrea]] (internationally recognized as the independent State of Eritrea in 1993 after a 30-year civil war).\n\n====East Africa====\n=====Somalia=====\n{{Main|Greater Somalia}}\n\n[[File:Somali map.jpg|thumb|Estimated ethnic Somali territory in relation to neighbouring countries.The area is roughly coextensive with [[Greater Somalia]].]]\n\nGreater Somalia refers to the region in the Horn of Africa in which [[Somalis|ethnic Somalis]] are and have historically represented the predominant population. The territory encompasses The Republic of Somalia, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya and southern and eastern Djibouti. [[Ogaden]] in eastern Ethiopia has seen military and civic movements seeking to make it part of [[Somalia]]. This culminated in the 1977\u201378 [[Ogaden War]] between the two neighbours where the Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden ended when the Somali Armed Forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. The Kenyan [[Northern Frontier District]] also saw conflict during the [[Shifta War]] (1963\u20131967) when a secessionist conflict in which ethnic Somalis in the [[Lamu County|Lamu]], [[Garissa County|Garissa]], [[Wajir County|Wajir]] and [[Mandera County|Mandera]] [[Counties of Kenya|counties]] (all except [[Lamu County|Lamu]] formed part of the former [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], abolished in 2013), attempted to join with their fellow Somalis in a \"[[Greater Somalia]]\". There has been no similar conflicts in Djibouti, which was previously known as the \"[[French Somaliland]]\" during colonisation. Here the apparent struggles for unification manifested itself in political strife that ended when in a referendum to join France as opposed to the Somali Republic succeeded among rumours of widespread [[vote rigging]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa Research Bulletin, Volume 3|author=Africa Research, Ltd|date=1966|publisher=Blackwell|page=597|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=42oEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> and the subsequent death of Somali nationalist [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council, who was killed in a plane crash two years later under suspicious circumstances.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell, ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States'', (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115</ref>\nSome sources say that Somalia has also laid a claim to the [[Socotra]] archipelago, which is currently governed by [[Yemen]].\n\n====North Africa====\nIn North Africa, the prime examples of irredentism are the concepts of [[Greater Morocco]] and [[Greater Mauritania]].<ref>http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/hasa03.pdf</ref> While Mauritania has since relinquished any claims to territories [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|outside its internationally recognized borders]], Morocco continues to claim [[Western Sahara]], which it refers to as its \"[[Southern Provinces]]\".\n\n=== Asia ===\n====East Asia====\n=====China=====\n{{Main|Chinese nationalism|Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Transfer of sovereignty over Macau}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nWhen [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] were [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] territories, respectively, China considered these two territories to be Chinese territories under British and Portuguese administration.

Both Korean states now accept the convention border as an administrative boundary. However, because the convention was made by the occupying [[Empire of Japan]], [[South Korea]] has disputed its legality and some Koreans claim that Korea extends into ''de facto'' PRC territory, viz.

Most prominent amongst them are the [[Naga (clan)|Naga]] fight for Greater [[Nagaland]], the [[Chin people|Chin]] struggle for a unified [[Chinland]], the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] struggle for a return of their state under [[Tamil Eelam]] and other self-determinist movements by the [[ethnic]] [[indigenous peoples]] of the erstwhile [[Assam]] both under the British and post-British Assam under India.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Other such movements include [[Belgaum border dispute|Be\u1e3bag\u0101va border dispute]] on [[Maharashtra]] and [[Karnataka]] border with intentions to unite all [[Marathi people|Marathi]] speaking people under one state since the formation of the Karnataka state and dissolution of the bilingual [[Bombay state]].\n\n=====Bangladesh=====\n{{Main|Greater Bangladesh}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nGreater Bangladesh is an assumption of several Indian intellectuals that the neighbouring country of Bangladesh has an aspiration to unite all Bengali dominated regions under their flag. These include the states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] as well as the [[Andaman Islands]] which are currently part of India and the Burmese [[Rakhine State|State of Rakhine]]. The theory is principally based on a widespread belief amongst Indian masses that a large number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants reside in Indian territory. It is alleged that illegal immigration is actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh as well as the state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states and West Bengal into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nScholars have reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population.

The term ''Kleindeutschland'' \"Lesser Germany\" referred to a possible German state without Austria. The term was later used by Germans referring to Greater Germany, a state consisting of pre\u2013World War I Germany, Austria and the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nA main point of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] was to reunify all Germans either born or living outside of Germany to create an \"all-German [[Reich]]\". These beliefs ultimately resulted in the Munich Agreement, which ceded to Germany [[The Sudetenland|areas of Czechoslovakia]] that were mainly inhabited by those of German descent, and the ''[[Anschluss]]'', which ceded the entire country of Austria to Germany; both events occurred in 1938.\n\n====Greece====\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|Claims presented by Greece at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]].]]\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821\u20131832, [[Greece]] began to contest areas inhabited by Greeks, primarily against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) envisioned Greek incorporation of Greek-inhabited lands, but also historical lands in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] corresponding with the predominantly Greek and Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] and the dominions of the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe Greek quest began with the acquisition of [[Thessaly]] through the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|Convention of Constantinople in 1881]], [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a failed war against Turkey in 1897]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], some [[Aegean Islands]]). After World War I, Greece acquired [[Western Thrace]] from [[Bulgaria]] as per the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], but also [[Ionia]]/[[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] and [[East Thrace|Eastern Thrace]] (excluding [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]) from the Ottoman Empire as ordained in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]. Subsequently, Greece launched an [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|unsuccessful campaign]] to further their gains in Asia Minor, but were halted by the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish revolution]]. The events culminated into the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], and [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which returned Eastern Thrace and Ionia to the newfound Turkish Republic. The events are known as the \"Asia Minor Catastrophe\" to Greeks. The [[Ionian Islands]] were ceded by Britain in 1864, and the [[Dodecanese]] by Italy in 1947.\n\nAnother concern of the Greeks is the [[Enosis|incorporation of Cyprus]] which was ceded by the Ottomans to [[British Cyprus (1878\u20131960)|the British]]. As a result of the [[Cyprus Emergency]] the island gained independence as the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] in 1960. The failed incorporation by Greece through [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 led to the formation of the mostly unrecognized [[Northern Cyprus]] and has culminated into the present-day [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus issue]].\n\nThe Aegean islands of [[Imbros and Tenedos]] which were not ceded to Greece over the course of the 20th century and where the dominant Greek community has faced persecution are also of concern.\n\n====Hungary====\n[[File:Territorial_gains_of_Hungary_1938-41_en.svg|thumb|Map of territories reassigned to Hungary in 1938\u20131941 including [[Northern Transylvania]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Hungarian irredentism}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe restoration of the borders of [[Hungary]] to their state prior to World War I, in order to unite all ethnic Hungarians within the same country once again.\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|Italian territory claims by Italian irredentism activists in the 1930s.]]\n\n{{Main|Italian irredentism|Italian Empire}}\n\nItaly's territorial claims were on the basis of re-establishing a Romanesque Empire, a fourth shore according to the concept of Mare Nostrum (Latin for 'Our Sea') and traditional ethnic borders. Evident in Italy's rapid takeover of surrounding territories under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and claims following the collapsed 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] which established feelings of betrayal. Mussolini and Hitler's similarities including a joint hatred towards the French and wanting to expand their territories brought the two leaders together, solidified in the [[Pact of Steel]] and later WW2. By 1942 Italy had conquered Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia and Eritrea), Libya, much of the north coast of Egypt, and what is now Somalia. And \u2013 on the European continent, and with significant German assistance, \u2013 Istria, Dalmatia, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and France's Corsica; Malta was also bombed. Underlying tensions remained with France, over its territories of Corsica, Nice and Savoy.\n\n====North Macedonia====\n{{Main|United Macedonia}}{{see also|Macedonian nationalism}}\n\nSome Macedonian nationalists promoted the irredentist concept of a [[United Macedonia]] ({{lang-mk|\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430|translit=Obedineta Makedonija}}) among [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] [[nationalism|nationalists]], which involves territorial claims on the northern province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] in [[Greece]], but also in [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (\"Pirin Macedonia\") in Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia.

Under Danish sovereignty since they established a hegemonic position in the [[Kalmar Union]], the territories were considered as Norwegian colonies. When in the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Norway's territories were transferred from [[Denmark]] to [[Sweden]], the territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands were maintained by Denmark.\n\nIn 1919, Norway declared sovereignty over an area in Eastern Greenland in the [[Ihlen Declaration]], which led to a dispute with Denmark that was not settled until 1933, by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. Norway formerly included the provinces [[J\u00e4mtland]], [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], [[Idre]]-[[S\u00e4rna]] (lost since the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]]), and [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] (lost since the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]), which were ceded to Sweden after Danish defeats in wars such as the [[Thirty Years' War]] and [[Second Northern War]].\n\n====Poland====\n{{See also|Polish nationalism|Kresy}}\n\n[[Kresy]] (\"Borderlands\") are the eastern lands that formerly belonged to [[Poland]].

Even though ''Kresy'', or the ''Eastern Borderlands'', are no longer Polish territories, the area is still inhabited by a significant Polish minority, and the memory of the Polish ''Kresy'' is still cultivated. The attachment to the \"myth of Kresy\", the vision of the region as a peaceful, idyllic, rural land, has been criticized in Polish discourse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/51,97863,7751751.html?i=0Czas|title=odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Czas odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Marcin Wojciechowski, Gazeta Wyborcza 2010-04-12, |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn January, February and March 2012, the [[Centre for Public Opinion Research]] conducted a survey, asking Poles about their ties to the Kresy.

There are Polish sports clubs ([[Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w (2009)|Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w]], and formerly [[FK Polonia Vilnius]]), newspapers ([[Gazeta Lwowska]], [[Kurier Wile\u0144ski]]), radio stations (in Lviv and Vilnius), numerous theatres, schools, choirs and folk ensembles. Poles living in ''Kresy'' are helped by [[Fundacja Pomoc Polakom na Wschodzie]], a Polish government-sponsored organization, as well as other organizations, such as The ''Association of Help of Poles in the East Kresy'' (see also [[Karta Polaka]]). Money is frequently collected to help those Poles who live in the ''Kresy'', and there are several annual events, such as a ''Christmas Package for a Polish Veteran in Kresy'', and ''Summer with Poland'', sponsored by the [[Association \"Polish Community\"]], in which Polish children from ''Kresy'' are invited to visit Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/wakacje/432777,dzieci-z-kresow-zwiedzaja-lodz-zdjecia,id,t.html|title=Dzieci z Kres\u00f3w zwiedzaj\u0105 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a [ZDJ\u0118CIA]|first=Micha\u0142|last=Meksa|publisher=}}</ref> Polish language handbooks and films, as well as medicines and clothes are collected and sent to ''Kresy''.

Crimea was part of the [[Russian Empire]] from 1783 to 1917, after which it enjoyed a few years of autonomy until it was made part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (which was a part of the Soviet Union) from 1921 to 1954 and then [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] to [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] (which also was a part of the Soviet Union) in 1954. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Crimea still remained part of Ukraine until February 2014. Russia declared Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation in March 2014, and effective administration commenced. The Russian regional status is not currently recognised by the UN General Assembly and by many countries.\n\nRussian irredentism also includes southeastern and coastal Ukraine, known as ''[[Novorossiya]]'', a term from the Russian Empire.\n\n====Serbia====\n{{Main|Greater Serbia}}\n\n[[File:Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, 1981.png|thumb|The distribution of Serbs and Montenegrins in Yugoslavia (except Macedonia and Slovenia) in 1981.]]\n\nSerbian irredentism is manifested in \"[[Greater Serbia]]\".

Some intellectuals sought to unite all South Slavs (regardless of religion) into a Serbian state. [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] had gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed by the Austrians in 1908, was viewed of as a part of the Serbian homeland. Serbia directed its territorial aspirations to the south, as the north and west was held by Austria. Macedonia was divided between Serbia and Greece after the [[Balkan Wars]].\n\nIn 1914, aspirations were directed towards Austria-Hungary. A government policy sought to incorporate all Serb-inhabited areas, and other South Slavic areas, thereby laying the foundation of [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Danver2010\">{{cite book|author=Steven L.

The Croatian [[Operation Storm]] ended large-scale combat and captured most of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], while the [[Dayton Agreement]] ended the Bosnian War.

It acknowledges the [[division of Korea]] only indirectly by requiring the president to work for reunification. The [[Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces]], established in 1949, is the South Korean authority charged with the administration of Korean territory north of the [[Military Demarcation Line]] (i.e., North Korea), and consists of the governors of the five provinces, who are appointed by the [[President of the Republic of Korea|President]].

Kashmir has remained divided in three parts, administered by India, Pakistan and [[China]], since then. However, on the basis of the instrument of accession, India continues to claim the entire Kashmir region as its integral part.

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed U.N. Resolution 181, otherwise known as the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], with 72% of the valid votes. Eventually, Israeli independence was achieved following the liquidation of the former British-administered Mandate of Palestine, the departure of the British and the \"Independence War\" between the Jews in ex-[[Mandatory Palestine]] and five Arab states' armies. The Jewish claim to Palestine as a [[Jewish homeland]] can be seen as an example of irredentist reclamation of what is considered lost Jewish land by Zionists. These claims are based on ancestral inhabitance (and in some periods sovereignty) in the land and the cultural/religious significance of it in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The latter is particularly relevant to the Israeli claim to Jerusalem. [[Mandatory Palestine]] had sizable [[History of the Jews in Palestine|Jewish]] and [[Palestinians|Arab]] populations before the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], as they are called in the Bible, were part of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] (designated the [[West Bank]] by Jordan in 1947) and the [[Gaza Strip]], previously annexed by Jordan and occupied by Egypt respectively, were conquered and occupied by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005; Judea and Samaria (West Bank) remain under Israeli control. Israel has never explicitly claimed sovereignty over any part of the West Bank apart from [[East Jerusalem]], which it unilaterally annexed in 1980. However, the Israeli military supports and defends hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who have [[Israeli settlements|migrated]] to the West Bank, incurring criticism by some who otherwise support Israel. The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, and some countries and international organizations continue to regard Israel as occupying Gaza. ''(See [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-Occupied Territories]])''\n\n[[File:Israel and occupied territories map.png|thumb|Israel and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]]]\nThe Israeli annexing instrument, the [[Jerusalem Law]]\u2014one of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] (Israel does not have a constitution)\u2014declares Jerusalem, \"complete and united\", to be the capital of Israel. Article 3 of the Basic Law of the [[Palestinian Authority]], which was ratified in 2002 by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and serves as an interim constitution, claims that \"[[Jerusalem]] is the capital of Palestine\". ''De facto'', the Palestinian government administers the parts of the [[West Bank]] that Israel has granted it authority over from [[Ramallah]], while the [[Gaza Strip]] is administered by [[Hamas|the Hamas movement]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]].\n\nThe United States did not recognize Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem until 2017. In Jerusalem, the United States maintained two Consulates General as a diplomatic representation to the city of Jerusalem alone, separate from representation to the state of Israel. One of the Consulates General was established before the 1967 war, and the other in a recently constructed building on the Israeli side of Jerusalem. Moreover, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] in 1995 that says the US shall move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but allows the [[President of the United States|president]] to delay the move every year if it is deemed contrary to national security interests.

This state did not include [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised six counties in the north-east of the island of [[Ireland]] which remained in the United Kingdom. When the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was adopted in 1937 it provided that the name of the state is ''Ireland'' and this is considered the time that the Republic of Ireland became a fully fledged independent nation. In the constitution [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]] provided that \"[t]he national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland\", while stipulating that \"[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory\", the powers of the state were restricted to legislate only for the area which had formed part of the [[Irish Free State]]. Arising from the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], the matter was mutually resolved as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s constitution was altered by [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|referendum]] and its territorial claim to [[Northern Ireland]] was removed.\n\nThe amended constitution asserts that while it is the entitlement of \"every person born in the island of Ireland \u2026 to be part of the Irish Nation\" and to hold Irish citizenship, \"a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island\". A [[North/South Ministerial Council]] was created between the two jurisdictions and given executive authority. The advisory and consultative role of the government of Ireland in the government of Northern Ireland granted by the United Kingdom, that had begun with the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], was maintained, although that Agreement itself was ended. The two states also settled the long-running [[Names of the Irish state|dispute concerning their respective names]]: ''Ireland'' and the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', with both governments agreeing to use those names.\n\nUnder the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory of [[Irish republican legitimism|legitimism]], the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1916 was in existence from then on, denying the legitimacy of either the state of Ireland or the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Through much of its [[history of Sinn F\u00e9in|history]], this was the position of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]; however, it effectively abandoned this stance after accepting the Good Friday Agreement. Small groups which split from Sinn F\u00e9in continue to adopt this stance, including [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], linked with the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], linked with the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]].\n\n==Historic, theoretical and fringe irredentistic claims==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n {{recentism|section|date=February 2018}}\n {{split section|date=February 2018}}\n}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nIrredentism is commonplace in [[Africa]] due to the political boundaries of former European colonial nation-states passing through ethnic boundaries, and recent declarations of independence after civil war. For example, some Ethiopian nationalist circles still claim the former Ethiopian province of [[Eritrea]] (internationally recognized as the independent State of Eritrea in 1993 after a 30-year civil war).\n\n====East Africa====\n=====Somalia=====\n{{Main|Greater Somalia}}\n\n[[File:Somali map.jpg|thumb|Estimated ethnic Somali territory in relation to neighbouring countries.The area is roughly coextensive with [[Greater Somalia]].]]\n\nGreater Somalia refers to the region in the Horn of Africa in which [[Somalis|ethnic Somalis]] are and have historically represented the predominant population. The territory encompasses The Republic of Somalia, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya and southern and eastern Djibouti. [[Ogaden]] in eastern Ethiopia has seen military and civic movements seeking to make it part of [[Somalia]]. This culminated in the 1977\u201378 [[Ogaden War]] between the two neighbours where the Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden ended when the Somali Armed Forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. The Kenyan [[Northern Frontier District]] also saw conflict during the [[Shifta War]] (1963\u20131967) when a secessionist conflict in which ethnic Somalis in the [[Lamu County|Lamu]], [[Garissa County|Garissa]], [[Wajir County|Wajir]] and [[Mandera County|Mandera]] [[Counties of Kenya|counties]] (all except [[Lamu County|Lamu]] formed part of the former [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], abolished in 2013), attempted to join with their fellow Somalis in a \"[[Greater Somalia]]\". There has been no similar conflicts in Djibouti, which was previously known as the \"[[French Somaliland]]\" during colonisation. Here the apparent struggles for unification manifested itself in political strife that ended when in a referendum to join France as opposed to the Somali Republic succeeded among rumours of widespread [[vote rigging]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa Research Bulletin, Volume 3|author=Africa Research, Ltd|date=1966|publisher=Blackwell|page=597|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=42oEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> and the subsequent death of Somali nationalist [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council, who was killed in a plane crash two years later under suspicious circumstances.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell, ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States'', (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115</ref>\nSome sources say that Somalia has also laid a claim to the [[Socotra]] archipelago, which is currently governed by [[Yemen]].\n\n====North Africa====\nIn North Africa, the prime examples of irredentism are the concepts of [[Greater Morocco]] and [[Greater Mauritania]].<ref>http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/hasa03.pdf</ref> While Mauritania has since relinquished any claims to territories [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|outside its internationally recognized borders]], Morocco continues to claim [[Western Sahara]], which it refers to as its \"[[Southern Provinces]]\".\n\n=== Asia ===\n====East Asia====\n=====China=====\n{{Main|Chinese nationalism|Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Transfer of sovereignty over Macau}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nWhen [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] were [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] territories, respectively, China considered these two territories to be Chinese territories under British and Portuguese administration. Therefore, [[Hong Kong people]] and [[Macau people]] descended from Chinese immigrants were entitled to [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport]] or [[Macao Special Administrative Region passport]] after the two territories became the [[special administrative region]]s.\n\n=====Korea=====\nThe 1909 [[Gando Convention]] addressed a territory dispute between China and [[Joseon Korea]] in China's favour. Both Korean states now accept the convention border as an administrative boundary. However, because the convention was made by the occupying [[Empire of Japan]], [[South Korea]] has disputed its legality and some Koreans claim that Korea extends into ''de facto'' PRC territory, viz. [[Dandong]] and [[Liaoning]]. The most ambitious claims include all parts of [[Manchuria]] that the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom controlled.\n\n=====Mongolia=====\n{{Main|Pan-Mongolism}}\n\nThe irredentist idea that advocates cultural and political solidarity of [[Mongols]]. The proposed territory usually includes the independent state of [[Mongolia]], the Chinese regions of [[Inner Mongolia]] (Southern Mongolia) and [[Dzungaria]] (in [[Xinjiang]]), and the Russian subjects of [[Buryatia]]. Sometimes [[Tuva]] and the [[Altai Republic]] are included as well.\n\n====South Asia====\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\n[[South Asia]] too is another region in which armed irredentist movements have been active for almost a century. Most prominent amongst them are the [[Naga (clan)|Naga]] fight for Greater [[Nagaland]], the [[Chin people|Chin]] struggle for a unified [[Chinland]], the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] struggle for a return of their state under [[Tamil Eelam]] and other self-determinist movements by the [[ethnic]] [[indigenous peoples]] of the erstwhile [[Assam]] both under the British and post-British Assam under India.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Other such movements include [[Belgaum border dispute|Be\u1e3bag\u0101va border dispute]] on [[Maharashtra]] and [[Karnataka]] border with intentions to unite all [[Marathi people|Marathi]] speaking people under one state since the formation of the Karnataka state and dissolution of the bilingual [[Bombay state]].\n\n=====Bangladesh=====\n{{Main|Greater Bangladesh}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nGreater Bangladesh is an assumption of several Indian intellectuals that the neighbouring country of Bangladesh has an aspiration to unite all Bengali dominated regions under their flag. These include the states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] as well as the [[Andaman Islands]] which are currently part of India and the Burmese [[Rakhine State|State of Rakhine]]. The theory is principally based on a widespread belief amongst Indian masses that a large number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants reside in Indian territory. It is alleged that illegal immigration is actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh as well as the state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states and West Bengal into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nScholars have reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population. In 1998, Lieutenant General S.K. Sinha, then the Governor of Assam, claimed that massive illegal immigration from Bangladesh was directly linked with \"the long-cherished design of Greater Bangladesh\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=====India=====\n{{Main|Indian nationalism|Greater India|Akhand Bharat}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe call for creation of ''Akhanda Bharata'' or ''Akhand Hindustan'' has on occasion been raised by some [[India]]n right wing [[Hindutva]]di cultural and political organisations, such as the [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha|Hindu Mahasabha]], [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP).<ref name=\"Ferguson\"/><ref name=\"Majumder\"/><ref name=\"Martensson\"/><ref name=\"Suda1953\">{{cite book|last=Suda|first=Jyoti Prasad|title=India, Her Civic Life and Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVsNAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 July 2014|year=1953|publisher=Jai Prakash Nath & Co.|quote=Its members still swear by the ideal of Akhand Hindustan.}}</ref> The name of one organisation sharing this goal, the [[Akhand Hindustan Morcha]], bears the term in its name.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hindu Political Parties|date=30 May 2010|publisher=General Books|isbn=9781157374923}}</ref> Other major Indian non-sectarian political parties, such as the [[Indian National Congress]], maintain a position against the [[partition of India]] .\n\n=====Iran=====\n{{Main|Pan-Iranism|Greater Iran}}\n\n[[Pan-Iranism]] is an [[ideology]] that advocates solidarity and reunification of [[Iranian people]]s living in the [[Iranian plateau]] and other regions that have significant Iranian cultural influence, including the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Ossetians]], [[Kurds]], [[Zazas]], [[Tajiks]] of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], the [[Pashtuns]] and the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] of [[Pakistan]].

The term ''Kleindeutschland'' \"Lesser Germany\" referred to a possible German state without Austria. The term was later used by Germans referring to Greater Germany, a state consisting of pre\u2013World War I Germany, Austria and the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nA main point of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] was to reunify all Germans either born or living outside of Germany to create an \"all-German [[Reich]]\". These beliefs ultimately resulted in the Munich Agreement, which ceded to Germany [[The Sudetenland|areas of Czechoslovakia]] that were mainly inhabited by those of German descent, and the ''[[Anschluss]]'', which ceded the entire country of Austria to Germany; both events occurred in 1938.\n\n====Greece====\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|Claims presented by Greece at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]].]]\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821\u20131832, [[Greece]] began to contest areas inhabited by Greeks, primarily against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) envisioned Greek incorporation of Greek-inhabited lands, but also historical lands in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] corresponding with the predominantly Greek and Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] and the dominions of the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe Greek quest began with the acquisition of [[Thessaly]] through the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|Convention of Constantinople in 1881]], [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a failed war against Turkey in 1897]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], some [[Aegean Islands]]). After World War I, Greece acquired [[Western Thrace]] from [[Bulgaria]] as per the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], but also [[Ionia]]/[[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] and [[East Thrace|Eastern Thrace]] (excluding [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]) from the Ottoman Empire as ordained in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]. Subsequently, Greece launched an [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|unsuccessful campaign]] to further their gains in Asia Minor, but were halted by the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish revolution]]. The events culminated into the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], and [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which returned Eastern Thrace and Ionia to the newfound Turkish Republic. The events are known as the \"Asia Minor Catastrophe\" to Greeks. The [[Ionian Islands]] were ceded by Britain in 1864, and the [[Dodecanese]] by Italy in 1947.\n\nAnother concern of the Greeks is the [[Enosis|incorporation of Cyprus]] which was ceded by the Ottomans to [[British Cyprus (1878\u20131960)|the British]]. As a result of the [[Cyprus Emergency]] the island gained independence as the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] in 1960. The failed incorporation by Greece through [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 led to the formation of the mostly unrecognized [[Northern Cyprus]] and has culminated into the present-day [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus issue]].\n\nThe Aegean islands of [[Imbros and Tenedos]] which were not ceded to Greece over the course of the 20th century and where the dominant Greek community has faced persecution are also of concern.\n\n====Hungary====\n[[File:Territorial_gains_of_Hungary_1938-41_en.svg|thumb|Map of territories reassigned to Hungary in 1938\u20131941 including [[Northern Transylvania]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Hungarian irredentism}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe restoration of the borders of [[Hungary]] to their state prior to World War I, in order to unite all ethnic Hungarians within the same country once again.\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|Italian territory claims by Italian irredentism activists in the 1930s.]]\n\n{{Main|Italian irredentism|Italian Empire}}\n\nItaly's territorial claims were on the basis of re-establishing a Romanesque Empire, a fourth shore according to the concept of Mare Nostrum (Latin for 'Our Sea') and traditional ethnic borders. Evident in Italy's rapid takeover of surrounding territories under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and claims following the collapsed 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] which established feelings of betrayal. Mussolini and Hitler's similarities including a joint hatred towards the French and wanting to expand their territories brought the two leaders together, solidified in the [[Pact of Steel]] and later WW2. By 1942 Italy had conquered Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia and Eritrea), Libya, much of the north coast of Egypt, and what is now Somalia. And \u2013 on the European continent, and with significant German assistance, \u2013 Istria, Dalmatia, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and France's Corsica; Malta was also bombed. Underlying tensions remained with France, over its territories of Corsica, Nice and Savoy.\n\n====North Macedonia====\n{{Main|United Macedonia}}{{see also|Macedonian nationalism}}\n\nSome Macedonian nationalists promoted the irredentist concept of a [[United Macedonia]] ({{lang-mk|\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430|translit=Obedineta Makedonija}}) among [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] [[nationalism|nationalists]], which involves territorial claims on the northern province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] in [[Greece]], but also in [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (\"Pirin Macedonia\") in Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia.

Under Danish sovereignty since they established a hegemonic position in the [[Kalmar Union]], the territories were considered as Norwegian colonies. When in the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Norway's territories were transferred from [[Denmark]] to [[Sweden]], the territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands were maintained by Denmark.\n\nIn 1919, Norway declared sovereignty over an area in Eastern Greenland in the [[Ihlen Declaration]], which led to a dispute with Denmark that was not settled until 1933, by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. Norway formerly included the provinces [[J\u00e4mtland]], [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], [[Idre]]-[[S\u00e4rna]] (lost since the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]]), and [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] (lost since the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]), which were ceded to Sweden after Danish defeats in wars such as the [[Thirty Years' War]] and [[Second Northern War]].\n\n====Poland====\n{{See also|Polish nationalism|Kresy}}\n\n[[Kresy]] (\"Borderlands\") are the eastern lands that formerly belonged to [[Poland]].

Even though ''Kresy'', or the ''Eastern Borderlands'', are no longer Polish territories, the area is still inhabited by a significant Polish minority, and the memory of the Polish ''Kresy'' is still cultivated. The attachment to the \"myth of Kresy\", the vision of the region as a peaceful, idyllic, rural land, has been criticized in Polish discourse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/51,97863,7751751.html?i=0Czas|title=odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Czas odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Marcin Wojciechowski, Gazeta Wyborcza 2010-04-12, |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn January, February and March 2012, the [[Centre for Public Opinion Research]] conducted a survey, asking Poles about their ties to the Kresy.

Poles living in ''Kresy'' are helped by [[Fundacja Pomoc Polakom na Wschodzie]], a Polish government-sponsored organization, as well as other organizations, such as The ''Association of Help of Poles in the East Kresy'' (see also [[Karta Polaka]]). Money is frequently collected to help those Poles who live in the ''Kresy'', and there are several annual events, such as a ''Christmas Package for a Polish Veteran in Kresy'', and ''Summer with Poland'', sponsored by the [[Association \"Polish Community\"]], in which Polish children from ''Kresy'' are invited to visit Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/wakacje/432777,dzieci-z-kresow-zwiedzaja-lodz-zdjecia,id,t.html|title=Dzieci z Kres\u00f3w zwiedzaj\u0105 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a [ZDJ\u0118CIA]|first=Micha\u0142|last=Meksa|publisher=}}</ref> Polish language handbooks and films, as well as medicines and clothes are collected and sent to ''Kresy''.

Crimea was part of the [[Russian Empire]] from 1783 to 1917, after which it enjoyed a few years of autonomy until it was made part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (which was a part of the Soviet Union) from 1921 to 1954 and then [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] to [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] (which also was a part of the Soviet Union) in 1954. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Crimea still remained part of Ukraine until February 2014. Russia declared Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation in March 2014, and effective administration commenced. The Russian regional status is not currently recognised by the UN General Assembly and by many countries.\n\nRussian irredentism also includes southeastern and coastal Ukraine, known as ''[[Novorossiya]]'', a term from the Russian Empire.\n\n====Serbia====\n{{Main|Greater Serbia}}\n\n[[File:Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, 1981.png|thumb|The distribution of Serbs and Montenegrins in Yugoslavia (except Macedonia and Slovenia) in 1981.]]\n\nSerbian irredentism is manifested in \"[[Greater Serbia]]\".

Some intellectuals sought to unite all South Slavs (regardless of religion) into a Serbian state. [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] had gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed by the Austrians in 1908, was viewed of as a part of the Serbian homeland. Serbia directed its territorial aspirations to the south, as the north and west was held by Austria. Macedonia was divided between Serbia and Greece after the [[Balkan Wars]].\n\nIn 1914, aspirations were directed towards Austria-Hungary. A government policy sought to incorporate all Serb-inhabited areas, and other South Slavic areas, thereby laying the foundation of [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Danver2010\">{{cite book|author=Steven L.

The Croatian [[Operation Storm]] ended large-scale combat and captured most of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], while the [[Dayton Agreement]] ended the Bosnian War. Bosnia and Herzegovina was established as a federal republic, made up by two separate entities, one being Serb-inhabited [[Republika Srpska]].

[[North Korea]]'s constitution stresses the importance of reunification, but, while it makes no similar formal provision for administering the South, it effectively claims its territory as it does not [[Diplomatic recognition|diplomatically recognise]] the Republic of Korea, deeming it an \"entity occupying the Korean territory\".\n\n[[South Korea]]'s constitution also claims jurisdiction over the entire Korean peninsula. It acknowledges the [[division of Korea]] only indirectly by requiring the president to work for reunification. The [[Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces]], established in 1949, is the South Korean authority charged with the administration of Korean territory north of the [[Military Demarcation Line]] (i.e., North Korea), and consists of the governors of the five provinces, who are appointed by the [[President of the Republic of Korea|President]].

After finishing school he volunteered for military service in [[West Germany]] for one year. Later he was recalled up to serve several times, rising to the rank of [[First lieutenant]]. In 1962, he entered [[Frankfurt University]], then later transferred to the [[University of Heidelberg]]. His academic program included studies in English and Slavic languages and literature.<ref name=enbio_arbpmark>{{cite web|url=http://www.synod.com/synod/engrocor/enbio_arbpmark.html |title=The Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia - Official Website |website=Synod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-11}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of his study of [[Slavistics]], he became a specialist in a number of Slavic languages and literature, including Russian, [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]. He completed his PhD with the doctoral thesis \"Biographical Literature of the [[Principality of Tver|Duchy of Tver]] in the 14th and 15th Centuries\".<ref name=enbio_arbpmark/>\n\nDuring his studies of Russian, he became acquainted with the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 community in [[Frankfurt]]. While studying under Professor Dmitri Chizhevsky at the University of Heidelberg, he visited the ROCOR Church of St. Alexander Nevsky in [[Mannheim]].\n\nIn 1964, he converted to Orthodox Christianity and became a [[Reader (liturgy)|reader]]. He later made trips to [[Mount Athos]] where he developed friendships with many of the elders, including two [[Hieromonk|Hieroschemamonks]] named Seraphim and Abel.<ref name=enbio_arbpmark/>\n\nHe continued his theological studies in 1973 in [[Belgrade]], Yugoslavia graduating with a degree in theology in 1979. In Belgrade, Michael became part of a tightly-knit group of Serbia elder's students through an archimandrite, [[Justin Popovi\u0107|St. Justin (Popovi\u0107)]]: hieromonks [[Amfilohije Radovi\u0107]], [[Atanasije (Jevti\u0107)]], [[Artemije (Radosavljevi\u0107)]] and [[Irinej (Bulovi\u0107)]], now bishops of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. In 1975, Michael chose a [[monasticism|monastic]] life and was [[tonsure]]d a [[monk]] with the name Mark by Bishop [[:orthodoxwiki:Paul (Pavlov) of Sydney|Paul (Pavlov)]] of Stuttgart.\n\nHe was [[ordination|ordained]] a [[deacon]] in the summer of 1975, and a [[hieromonk]] three days later by Bishop Paul. Hieromonk Mark was appointed Deputy [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of the Russian church in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany. In 1976, he was elevated to the rank of [[archimandrite]].\n\n30 November 1980, he was [[consecration of a bishop|consecrated]] bishop, and was installed as the (ROCOR) Bishop of Munich and Southern Germany succeeding bishop [[Paul (Pavlov)]].\n\nIn 1982, he was assigned as Bishop of Berlin and All Germany.\n\nIn April 1986 he was appointed Ruling Bishop of the [[Russian Orthodox Diocese of Great Britain and Ireland|Diocese of Great Britain and Ireland]] and [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Alexander Nevsky Church, Copenhagen|St. Alexander Nevsky Church]] in [[Copenhagen]].\n\nIn 1990, he was elevated to the rank of [[Archbishop]].\n\nIn 1997, he was also appointed Overseer of the [[Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem]].\n\nArchbishop Mark has been one of the most ardent supporters of Church unity between ROCOR and the [[Moscow Patriarchate]], and worked tirelessly to see this goal achieved.

It also maintains equipment and has other affiliations with [[Petersburg Area Transit]], a similar agency which also serves a portion of Chesterfield County.\n\n==Ownership and management==\n[[File:GRTC Pulse travelling.jpg|thumb|right|GRTC bus operating along the GRTC Pulse bus rapid transit line]]\nAs a [[public service company]], GRTC is owned equally by the City of Richmond and neighboring Chesterfield County. Henrico and Hanover counties currently purchase services from it, but hold no ownership interest.\n\nIt is managed by a private transit management company that provides the CEO, COO, and Transportation Manager, as was its predecessor, Virginia Transit Company (VTC).  GRTC itself has 400 employees.  \n \n===Ownership history===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\n{{prose|section|date=May 2018}}\nIn 1860, Richmond Railway was organized, beginning operations in August.  The service was forced to stop for nearly 2 years during the Civil War.\n\nIn 1866, Joseph Jackson, Jr., acquired control and resumed operations.\n\nIn 1881, it was sold to [[Richmond City Railway Company]].\n\nIn 1887, The Richmond City Council adopted an ordinance granting a franchise to the [[Richmond Union Passenger Railway Company]] to operate a street railway system.  Ground was broken for laying rail.\n\nIn 1888, Frank Sprague installed a complete system of electric streetcars in Richmond, Virginia. This was the first large scale and successful use of electricity to run a city's entire system of streetcars.  Operation of streetcars continued until they were totally replaced by buses in 1949.\n\nIn 1925, Virginia Railway and Power company bought the transit system.\n\nIn 1944, the Securities and Exchange Commission directed [[Dominion Resources|Virginia Electric and Power]] company to confine its activities to the electricity business.\n\nIn 1944, the Richmond transit bus system (and a similar one in Norfolk) was purchased by VTC, which became part of the United Transit Company the next year. After [[World War II]], public transit systems in the United States became unprofitable, and most were eventually converted to government-owned and funded operations. This trend included Virginia Transit Company operations in Richmond and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]].\n\nIn 1947, the Main Street and Westhampton streetcar lines are motorized.  Virginia Transit Company began conversion to motor buses.\n\nIn 1949, Buses replace electric trolleys.  On November 25, 1949, ten streetcars make the last run.\n\nIn 1962, [[First Transit|American Transportation Enterprises]], Inc., acquired controlling interest in United Transit Company. \n \nIn 1972, federal, state and local funds were used to purchase the assets of the Virginia Transit Company, and a new public service company was set up, GRTC, which was wholly owned by the City of Richmond. A one-half interest was later purchased by Chesterfield County in the late 1980s. Henrico County declined to purchase a portion at that time.\n\n===Management history===\nImmediately after GRTC was formed, American Transportation Enterprises, Inc., through a subsidiary, continued to provide management.\n\n==Routes==\n{{anchor|1-99}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

It also maintains equipment and has other affiliations with [[Petersburg Area Transit]], a similar agency which also serves a portion of Chesterfield County.\n\n==Ownership and management==\n[[File:GRTC Pulse travelling.jpg|thumb|right|GRTC bus operating along the GRTC Pulse bus rapid transit line]]\nAs a [[public service company]], GRTC is owned equally by the City of Richmond and neighboring Chesterfield County. Henrico and Hanover counties currently purchase services from it, but hold no ownership interest.\n\nIt is managed by a private transit management company that provides the CEO, COO, and Transportation Manager, as was its predecessor, Virginia Transit Company (VTC).  GRTC itself has 400 employees.  \n \n===Ownership history===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\n{{prose|section|date=May 2018}}\nIn 1860, Richmond Railway was organized, beginning operations in August.  The service was forced to stop for nearly 2 years during the Civil War.\n\nIn 1866, Joseph Jackson, Jr., acquired control and resumed operations.\n\nIn 1881, it was sold to [[Richmond City Railway Company]].\n\nIn 1887, The Richmond City Council adopted an ordinance granting a franchise to the [[Richmond Union Passenger Railway Company]] to operate a street railway system.  Ground was broken for laying rail.\n\nIn 1888, Frank Sprague installed a complete system of electric streetcars in Richmond, Virginia. This was the first large scale and successful use of electricity to run a city's entire system of streetcars.  Operation of streetcars continued until they were totally replaced by buses in 1949.\n\nIn 1925, Virginia Railway and Power company bought the transit system.\n\nIn 1944, the Securities and Exchange Commission directed [[Dominion Resources|Virginia Electric and Power]] company to confine its activities to the electricity business.\n\nIn 1944, the Richmond transit bus system (and a similar one in Norfolk) was purchased by VTC, which became part of the United Transit Company the next year. After [[World War II]], public transit systems in the United States became unprofitable, and most were eventually converted to government-owned and funded operations. This trend included Virginia Transit Company operations in Richmond and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]].\n\nIn 1947, the Main Street and Westhampton streetcar lines are motorized.  Virginia Transit Company began conversion to motor buses.\n\nIn 1949, Buses replace electric trolleys.  On November 25, 1949, ten streetcars make the last run.\n\nIn 1962, [[First Transit|American Transportation Enterprises]], Inc., acquired controlling interest in United Transit Company. \n \nIn 1972, federal, state and local funds were used to purchase the assets of the Virginia Transit Company, and a new public service company was set up, GRTC, which was wholly owned by the City of Richmond. A one-half interest was later purchased by Chesterfield County in the late 1980s. Henrico County declined to purchase a portion at that time.\n\n===Management history===\nImmediately after GRTC was formed, American Transportation Enterprises, Inc., through a subsidiary, continued to provide management.\n\n==Routes==\n{{anchor|1-99}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Inspired by the limitless possibilities of this \u201cGold turbo\u201d state, both Drum and Delta seek the same bond with their Beys.\n\nDante and his partner, Ace Dragon, set off for Japan, the birthplace of Beyblade. But the path to glory won\u2019t be easy; plenty of tough competitors and Gamma Beys stand in their way, among them some of the best to ever let it rip. Dante soon realizes he\u2019ll have to do whatever it takes to deepen his bond with Dragon.\n\nDo Dante and Dragon have what it takes to overcome these challenges? and will they ever achieve Hyper-Flux?. Here begins the story of Dante and Dragon's rise to the peak of the Blading world.\n\nThen they met the destroyer \"Prime Apocalypses\" And Gwen's \"Regalia Genesis\". Prime Apocalypses destroyed Ace dragon, Drum was sad, but Aiger held him up. Soon, he made his new bey \"Imperial dragon\" and Delta made \"Master diabolos\" together they defeated the \"big bang Genesis\", and moves on to Beyblade burst superking!!!!!\n\n===''Beyblade Burst Superking'' (2020-21)===\n{{expand-section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Official characters==\n{{section split|List of Beyblade Burst characters|date=November 2017}}\n===Main characters===\n;Valt Aoi / {{nihongo|Baruto Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95 \u30d0\u30eb\u30c8|Aoi Baruto}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Marina Inoue]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]] (seasons 1 and 2), [[Kimlinh Tran]] (season 3)}}\nValt is an energetic 11-year-old boy who dreams on being world champion.\n\n;Rantaro Kiyama / {{nihongo|\u9ec4\u5c71 \u4e71\u592a\u90ce|Kiyama Rantar\u014d}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Fumihiro Okabayashi]]|[[Matt Hill]] (seasons 1 and 2)}}\n:Also known as '''{{nihongo|Honcho|\u30af\u30df\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc|Kumicho}}'''\n\n;Ranjiro Kiyama / {{nihongo|\u9ec4\u5c71 \u4e71\u6b21\u90ce|Kiyama Ranjiro)}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Fumihiro Okabayashi]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]}}\n:Also known as '''{{nihongo|Cap'n|\u30bd\u30fc\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc|Socho}}'''\n\n;Ken Midori / {{nihongo|Kensuke Midorikawa|\u7dd1\u5ddd \u30b1\u30f3\u30b9\u30b1|Midorikawa Kensuke}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Tsubasa Yonaga]]|[[Gabe Khouth]]}}\n\n;Daigo Kurogami / {{nihongo|Daina Kurogami|\u9ed2\u795e \u30c0\u30a4\u30ca|Kurogami Daina}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ayahi Takagaki]]|[[Antony Kim]] (first half of season one), [[Zach LeBlanc]] (from second half of season one to season two)}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Hoji Konda|\u7d3a\u7530\u30db\u30a6\u30b8/\u7d3a\u7530\u6cd5\u4e8b|Konda Houji}}\n:{{animevoices|[[T\u014dru Nara]]|[[Brett Bauer]]}}\n\n;Wakiya Murasaki / {{nihongo|Wakiya Komurasaki|\u5c0f\u7d2b \u30ef\u30ad\u30e4|Komurasaki Wakiya}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]|[[Cole Howard (voice actor)|Cole Howard]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Shu Kurenai|\u7d05 \u30b7\u30e5\u30a6|Kurenai Sh\u016b}}/ {{nihongo|Red Eye|\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30a2\u30a4|Reddo Ai}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Junya Enoki]]|[[Adrian Petriw]] (seasons 1 and 2), [[Alan Lee]] (season 3)}}\n\n;Toko Aoi / {{nihongo|Tokonatsu Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u5e38\u590f|Aoi Tokonatsu}}\n:{{animevoices|[[You Taichi]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Nika Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u65e5\u590f|Aoi Nika}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Aoi Inase]]|[[Sabrina Pitre]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiharu Aoi|\u84bc\u4e95\u5343\u6625|Aoi Chiharu}}\n\n;Kit Lopez / {{nihongo|Kitto Ropesu|\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30ed\u30da\u30b9|Ropesu Kitto}}\n\n;Silas Karlisle (Sisco Karlisle) / {{nihongo|Shisuko K\u0101rairu|\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u30ab\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30eb|K\u0101rairu Shisuko}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Takuma Terashima]]|[[Connor Parnall]]}}\n\n;Free De La Hoya / {{nihongo|Fur\u012b Derah\u014dya|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30c7\u30e9\u30db\u30fc\u30e4|Derah\u014dya Fur\u012b}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ryoko Shiraishi]]|Sean Thomas}}\n\n;Cuza Ackerman / {{nihongo|K\u016bza Akk\u0101man\u30af\u30fc\u30b6\u30a2\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30de\u30f3&\u30ab\u30fc\u30eb |Akk\u0101man K\u016bza}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Junko Takeuchi]]|Valin Shinyei}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Rickson Clay|\u30ea\u30af\u30bd\u30f3\u30af\u30ec\u30a4|}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Shasa Guten (Sasha Guten)|\u30b5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30fb\u30b0\u30c6\u30f3/|}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Honey Guten|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc\u30fb\u30b0\u30c6\u30f3|}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Aoi Koga]]|[[Caitlyn Bairstow]]}}\n\n;Kristina Kuroda / {{nihongo|Kurisut\u012bna Kuroda|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30ca \u30af\u30ed\u30c0|Kuroda Kurisut\u012bna}}\n\n;Raul Comas / {{nihongo|Zoro|\u30be\u30ed|Zoro}}\n\n;Trad Vazquez / {{nihongo|Toraddo Basukesu|\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30b9\u30b1\u30b9|Basukesu Toraddo}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Orochi Ginba|\u9280\u5203\u30aa\u30ed\u30c1/ \u9280\u5203\u5927\u86c7|Ginba Orochi}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Takahiro Mizushima]]|[[Daniel Bacon]]}} \n\n;Alexander 'Xander' Shakadera / {{nihongo|Kaiza Shakuenji|\u707c\u708e\u5bfa \u30ab\u30a4\u30b6|Shakuenji Kaiza}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Rikiya Koyama]]|[[Andrew Francis]]}}\n:Also known as '''Xander / {{nihongo4|Xhaka|\u30b7\u30e3\u30ab|Kshaka}}'''.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yugo Nansui|\u5357\u7fe0\u30e6\u30fc\u30b4|Nansui Yugo}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Daichi Hayashi]]|[[Nick Wolfhard]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Ukyo Ibuki|\u96ea\u5439\u53f3\u4eac|Ibuki Ukyo}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Natsumi Fujiwara]]|[[Vincent Tong]]}}\n\n;Zac Kaneguro / {{nihongo|Zenkuro Kurogane|\u9ed2\u9280\u5584\u4e5d\u90ce|Kurogane Zenkuro}}\n:Also known as '''Zac the Sunrise / Zac the Sunshine'''.\n\n;Quon Limon / {{nihongo|Quon Kimidori|\u9ec4\u7dd1\u30af\u30aa\u30f3|Kimidori Quon}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Yuka Nishigaki]]|[[Jonathan Whitesell]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Ben Azuki|\u5c0f\u8c46\u30d9\u30f3|Azuki Ben}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Mariko Higashiuchi]]|[[David A.

The country was exhausted by death on a massive scale and crippling taxes; the Black Death was followed by [[Hundred Years' War|years of war]], which had to be paid for. The population was nearly halved by disease and overworked, and onerous flat-rate [[Tax per head|poll taxes]] were imposed.{{sfn|Vine|2014}}\n\nBall was imprisoned in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]], at the time of the 1381 Revolt.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=263}} What is recorded of his adult life comes from hostile sources emanating from the religious and political social order.  He is said to have gained considerable fame as a roving preacher without a parish or any link to the established order{{sfn|Vine|2014}} by expounding the doctrines of [[John Wycliffe]], and especially by his insistence on social equality.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=263}} He delivered radical sermons in many places, including [[Ashen, Essex|Ashen]], [[Billericay]], Bocking, [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]], [[Cressing Temple]], [[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]], [[Coggeshall]], [[Fobbing]], [[Goldhanger]], [[Great Baddow]], [[Little Henny]], [[Stisted]] and Waltham.{{sfn|Vine|2014}}\n\nHis utterances brought him into conflict with [[Simon of Sudbury]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and he was thrown in prison on several occasions. He also appears to have been [[excommunicated]]; owing to which, in 1366 it was forbidden for anyone to hear him preach.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=263}} These measures, however, did not moderate his opinions, nor diminish his popularity, and he took to speaking to parishioners in churchyards after official services.{{sfn|Vine|2014}}\n\n[[File:Blackheath.jpg|thumb|A modern aerial view of the Blackheath looking south]]\nShortly after the Peasants' Revolt began, Ball was released by the Kentish rebels from his prison.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=263}} He preached to them at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] (the peasants' rendezvous to the south of [[Greenwich]]) in an open-air [[sermon]] that included the following:\n\n{{quote|When [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] delved and Eve span,{{efn|''Delved'' meaning dug the fields, and ''span'' meaning spun fabric (or [[flax]]).}} Who was then the [[gentleman]]?<ref name=delved>\"When Adam delved and Eve span,/Who was then the gentleman\" Sources\n* {{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=263}}\n* [http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/english/ad/adam.html Webster's online Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050512095748/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/english/ad/adam.html |date=12 May 2005 }}\n* [http://www.bartleby.com/65/ba/Ball-Joh.html The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001]\n* [http://www.bartleby.com/66/30/5330.html The Columbia World of Quotations. 1996]\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/voices/voices_reading_revolt.shtml BBC: VOICES OF THE POWERLESS \u2013 READINGS FROM ORIGINAL SOURCES]\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10609 English Literature by William Joseph Long]\n*Other versions\n** \"When Adam dalved and Eve span, / Where was than the pride of man?\" Richard Rolle de Hampole.

The country was exhausted by death on a massive scale and crippling taxes; the Black Death was followed by [[Hundred Years' War|years of war]], which had to be paid for. The population was nearly halved by disease and overworked, and onerous flat-rate [[Tax per head|poll taxes]] were imposed.{{sfn|Vine|2014}}\n\nBall was imprisoned in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]], at the time of the 1381 Revolt.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=263}} What is recorded of his adult life comes from hostile sources emanating from the religious and political social order.  He is said to have gained considerable fame as a roving preacher without a parish or any link to the established order{{sfn|Vine|2014}} by expounding the doctrines of [[John Wycliffe]], and especially by his insistence on social equality.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=263}} He delivered radical sermons in many places, including [[Ashen, Essex|Ashen]], [[Billericay]], Bocking, [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]], [[Cressing Temple]], [[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]], [[Coggeshall]], [[Fobbing]], [[Goldhanger]], [[Great Baddow]], [[Little Henny]], [[Stisted]] and Waltham.{{sfn|Vine|2014}}\n\nHis utterances brought him into conflict with [[Simon of Sudbury]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and he was thrown in prison on several occasions. He also appears to have been [[excommunicated]]; owing to which, in 1366 it was forbidden for anyone to hear him preach.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=263}} These measures, however, did not moderate his opinions, nor diminish his popularity. He took to speaking to parishioners in churchyards after the official services: in English, the \"common tongue\", not the Latin of the clergy, a radical political move. Ball was \"using the bible against the church\", very threatening to the status quo.{{sfn|Vine|2014}}\n\n[[File:Blackheath.jpg|thumb|A modern aerial view of the Blackheath looking south]]\nShortly after the Peasants' Revolt began, Ball was released by the Kentish rebels from his prison.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=263}} He preached to them at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] (the peasants' rendezvous to the south of [[Greenwich]]) in an open-air [[sermon]] that included the following:\n\n{{quote|When [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] delved and Eve span,{{efn|''Delved'' meaning dug the fields, and ''span'' meaning spun fabric (or [[flax]]).}} Who was then the [[gentleman]]?<ref name=delved>\"When Adam delved and Eve span,/Who was then the gentleman\" Sources\n* {{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=263}}\n* [http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/english/ad/adam.html Webster's online Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050512095748/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/english/ad/adam.html |date=12 May 2005 }}\n* [http://www.bartleby.com/65/ba/Ball-Joh.html The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001]\n* [http://www.bartleby.com/66/30/5330.html The Columbia World of Quotations. 1996]\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/voices/voices_reading_revolt.shtml BBC: VOICES OF THE POWERLESS \u2013 READINGS FROM ORIGINAL SOURCES]\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10609 English Literature by William Joseph Long]\n*Other versions\n** \"When Adam dalved and Eve span, / Where was than the pride of man?\" Richard Rolle de Hampole.

(The Frater should normally extend at right-angles to the south range.) On the west side of the cloister was a wall separating it from an open area or lane, beyond which the western range (the [[Cellarium]]) stood.

European settlement in Illinois began with the French from 1690 and reached its peak about 1750, mainly along the [[Mississippi River]]. American settlers arrived in 1790. The French came as merchants and missionaries, with farming supplementing the need for trade. The result had benefited both the settlers and the Native Americans. The American migration, however, followed treaties which resulted in land being distributed through [[American Law]], ignoring previous indigenous rights. Encroachment ensued and caused hard feelings between the Indians and the settlers who moved into the interior and along migration routes. Many of the Indians allied themselves with the British to resist, though trade with the Americans was an important reason why the Native Americans remained largely peaceful.<ref name=SALCOHIS>{{cite book|title=The History of Southern Illinois|first=Pam|last=Mardos|publisher=unknown|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nThe town of Harrisburg was platted a few miles south of the junction of the [[Goshen Road|Goshen]] and [[Shawneetown\u2013Kaskaskia Trail]], two of the first pioneer trade routes in the state. Prior to the [[War of 1812]], most of the population of today's Saline County lived in cabins clustered around [[blockhouse]]s to protect against Indian attack and dangerous wildlife such as [[Black panther|wild cats]] and [[American black bear|bears]]. Permanent settlements in the forested area were inevitable with the influx of more settlers, and the first land entry was made in 1814 by John Wren and Hankerson Rude. By 1840 the settlers outnumbered the Native Americans, and most of the black bear population of the county had been killed off by 1845.<ref name=\"SALCOHIS\"/>\n\n===Founding===\nHarrisburg was plotted shortly after Saline County was established in 1847 from part of [[Gallatin County, Illinois|Gallatin County]].

The [[Saline County, Illinois|Saline County]] courthouse and square have gone through many transformations within the past 100 years. In the 19th century, the town had dirt streets with a large [[Greek Revival]] courthouse with [[Doric columns]] built by Swiss-born, Evansville, Indiana Architect J. K. Frick & Co in 1861. The courthouse was then replaced in 1906 with a larger building designed by then well-known architect [[John W. Gaddis]] of [[Vincennes, Indiana]]. The structure was an identical model to the Perry County Courthouse at [[Perryville, Missouri]], both built the same year. A smaller version of the central clock tower of the courthouse, including the original clock, manufactured by the [[E. Howard & Co.|Howard Clock Company]], of Boston Massachusetts in 1904 was recreated in 1996, and placed in a small lot behind the [[Clearwave Communications|Clearwave]] Building's parking lot.

Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the Piankashaw tribe was driven out by the more aggressive Shawnee. European settlement in Illinois began with the French from 1690 and reached its peak about 1750, mainly along the [[Mississippi River]]. American settlers arrived in 1790. The French came as merchants and missionaries, with farming supplementing the need for trade. The result had benefited both the settlers and the Native Americans. The American migration, however, followed treaties which resulted in land being distributed through [[American Law]], ignoring previous indigenous rights. Encroachment ensued and caused hard feelings between the Indians and the settlers who moved into the interior and along migration routes. Many of the Indians allied themselves with the British to resist, though trade with the Americans was an important reason why the Native Americans remained largely peaceful.<ref name=SALCOHIS>{{cite book|title=The History of Southern Illinois|first=Pam|last=Mardos|publisher=unknown|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nThe town of Harrisburg was platted a few miles south of the junction of the [[Goshen Road|Goshen]] and [[Shawneetown\u2013Kaskaskia Trail]], two of the first pioneer trade routes in the state. Prior to the [[War of 1812]], most of the population of today's Saline County lived in cabins clustered around [[blockhouse]]s to protect against Indian attack and dangerous wildlife such as [[Black panther|wild cats]] and [[American black bear|bears]]. Permanent settlements in the forested area were inevitable with the influx of more settlers, and the first land entry was made in 1814 by John Wren and Hankerson Rude. By 1840 the settlers outnumbered the Native Americans, and most of the black bear population of the county had been killed off by 1845.<ref name=\"SALCOHIS\"/>\n\n===Founding===\nHarrisburg was plotted shortly after Saline County was established in 1847 from part of [[Gallatin County, Illinois|Gallatin County]]. The city was named for James Alexander Harris, who had built a farmhouse and planted a corn field in a clearing in the area of the current city square around 1820.<ref name=\"Brief\">{{cite book|title=A History of Saline County and a Brief History of Harrisburg, Illinois,|publisher=Illinois State Historical Society|page=25|year=1934|url = http://www.heritech.com/soil/history/saline_hbg_history.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHarris along with John Pankey, James P. Yandell, and John X. Cain, donated land for the first additions of the town to a special committee at Liberty Baptist Church in 1852, after complaints that the county seat should be centralized in the county. The county seat then was in [[Raleigh, Illinois|Raleigh]]. The county's two main population centers were divided by the Saline River and {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} of [[thicket]]. There were no roads in the county and many residents from the areas of [[Carrier Mills, Illinois|Carrier Mills]] and [[Stonefort, Illinois|Stonefort]] became lost when traveling to the northern settlements of [[Raleigh, Illinois|Raleigh]], [[Galatia, Illinois|Galatia]], and [[Eldorado, Illinois|Eldorado]]. The designated town plat was considered due to its aesthetic properties, a {{convert|60|ft|m|0|adj=on}} sandstone [[Hill|bluff]] overlooking the [[Saline River (Illinois)|Saline River]] valley called \"Crusoe's Island\". Although it was heavily timbered with oak and hickory with an impenetrable hazel underbrush, the site was at the geographical center of the county. A major legal battle took place within the county government because of  voter fraud accusations by the people of Raleigh.<ref name=\"Brief\"/> Nevertheless, Harrisburg was plotted as a village on {{convert|20|acre|m2|-1}} in 1853 and became the county seat in 1859.\n\n===Industrial origins===\n[[Image:Salinecourthouseandhotelsterling.jpg|thumb|left|Left: First [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] Saline County Courthouse, Right: Garrison House, later Hotel Sterling on Poplar Street.]]\nBetween 1860 and 1865 southern cotton became unavailable during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Harrisburg was one of the few cities in the [[Upland South]] during this time to have woolen mills, making the town an industrial asset early on to [[Southern Illinois]].

At the beginning of the 20th century, Harrisburg prospered with one of the largest downtown districts in downstate Illinois.]]\nDuring the early 20th century, [[urbanization]] of the city due to the geographical feature of \"Cruesoe's Island\" and surrounding coal mining property created a density not seen in many cities of its size. The city at the time with a population nearing 10,000 was forced to tightly cram homes and businesses upon the sandstone outcropping less than a square mile in diameter leading many to build their buildings with multiple stories around the town square. The [[Saline County, Illinois|Saline County]] courthouse and square have gone through many transformations within the past 100 years. In the 19th century, the town had dirt streets with a large [[Greek Revival]] courthouse with [[Doric columns]] built by Swiss-born, Evansville, Indiana Architect J. K. Frick & Co in 1861. The courthouse was then replaced in 1906 with a larger building designed by then well-known architect [[John W. Gaddis]] of [[Vincennes, Indiana]]. The structure was an identical model to the Perry County Courthouse at [[Perryville, Missouri]], both built the same year. A smaller version of the central clock tower of the courthouse, including the original clock, manufactured by the [[E. Howard & Co.|Howard Clock Company]], of Boston Massachusetts in 1904 was recreated in 1996, and placed in a small lot behind the [[Clearwave Communications|Clearwave]] Building's parking lot. The Howard clock company was notable for manufacturing large clocks in such buildings as the [[Wrigley Building]] in [[Chicago]], and the [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]] in [[San Francisco, California]].

During the closing of the coal mining era, most of the businesses left the square and moved to the main drag of [[U.S. Route 45|Rt. 45]], constructed in 1926. The courthouse built by [[John W. Gaddis]] was replaced with a modern, more efficient building in 1967 after the older building was condemned.<ref name=\"100 years\"/> Over the years, the architecture that graced Harrisburg square has slowly turned to rotting older structures mixed in with a hodge-podge of newer updated buildings. Currently there are a few privately owned downtown renovation projects in progress on and around the square.<ref name=\"100 years\"/>\n\nThe [[Carnegie Library|Harrisburg Mitchell-Carnegie Library]], located on Church Street south of the square and built with a grant from [[Andrew Carnegie]], was built in 1908 and opened to the public in 1909. The building served the community until 2000 when the library was moved to a new building on north Main Street. During the [[Ohio River flood of 1937|1937 flood]], the library was used as a makeshift hospital until the water boiler burst. The building now serves as a church.\n\nHarrisburg has three city parks.

The major glands of the endocrine system include the [[pineal gland]], [[pituitary gland]], [[pancreas]], [[Ovary|ovaries]], [[Testicle|testes]], [[thyroid|thyroid gland]], [[parathyroid gland]], [[hypothalamus]] and [[adrenal gland]]s. The hypothalamus and pituitary glands are [[neuroendocrine]] [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.\n\n[[File:Endocrine central nervous en.svg|thumb|350px| Endocrine glands in the human head and neck and their hormones]]\n{{Main|Pituitary gland}}\nThe [[pituitary gland]] hangs from the base of the [[brain]] by the [[pituitary stalk]], and is enclosed by bone. It consists of a hormone-producing glandular portion the [[anterior pituitary]] and a neural portion the [[posterior pituitary]], which is an extension of the [[hypothalamus]]. The hypothalamus regulates the hormonal output of the anterior pituitary and creates two hormones that it exports to the posterior pituitary for storage and later release.\n\nFour of the six anterior pituitary hormones are [[tropic hormone]]s that regulate the function of other endocrine organs. Most anterior pituitary hormones exhibit a diurnal rhythm of release, which is subject to modification by stimuli influencing the hypothalamus.\n\nSomatotropic hormone or [[growth hormone]] (GH) is an [[anabolism|anabolic hormone]] that stimulates growth of all body tissues  especially skeletal muscle and bone. It may act directly, or indirectly via [[insulin-like growth factor]]s (IGFs). GH mobilizes fats, stimulates protein synthesis, and inhibits glucose uptake and metabolism. Secretion is regulated by [[growth hormone releasing hormone]] (GHRH) and [[Somatostatin|growth hormone inhibiting hormone]] (GHIH), or somatostatin. Hypersecretion causes [[gigantism]] in children and [[acromegaly]] in adults; [[hyposecretion]] in children causes [[Growth hormone deficiency|pituitary dwarfism]].\n\n[[Thyroid-stimulating hormone]] promotes normal development and activity of the [[thyroid gland]]. [[Thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] stimulates its release; negative feedback of thyroid hormone inhibits it.\n\n[[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]] stimulates the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[corticosteroids]]. Adrenocorticotropic hormone release is triggered by [[corticotropin]]-releasing hormone and inhibited by rising [[glucocorticoid]] levels.\n\nThe [[gonadotropin]]s\u2014[[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and [[luteinizing hormone]] regulate the functions of the gonads in both sexes. Follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates sex cell production; luteinizing hormone stimulates [[gonadal hormone]] production. Gonadotropin levels rise in response to [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]]. Negative feedback of gonadal hormones inhibits gonadotropin release.\n\n[[Prolactin]] promotes milk production in human females. Its secretion is prompted by [[PRLH|prolactin-releasing hormone]] and inhibited by [[prolactin-inhibiting hormone]].\n\nThe intermediate lobe of pituitary gland secretes only one enzyme that is [[melanocyte stimulating hormone]]. It is linked with the formation of the black pigment in our skin called melanin.\n\nThe [[Posterior pituitary|neurohypophysis]] stores and releases two hypothalamic hormones:\n* [[Oxytocin]] stimulates powerful uterine contractions, which trigger labor and delivery of an infant, and milk ejection in nursing women. Its release is mediated reflexively by the hypothalamus and represents a positive feedback mechanism.\n* [[Vasopressin|Antidiuretic hormone]] stimulates the kidney tubules to reabsorb and conserve water, resulting in small volumes of highly concentrated urine and decreased plasma osmolarity. Antidiuretic hormone is released in response to high solute concentrations in the blood and inhibited by low solute concentrations in the blood. Hyposecretion results in diabetes insipidus.\n\n===Thyroid gland===\n{{Main|Thyroid}}\nThe thyroid gland is located at the front of the neck, in front of the [[thyroid cartilage]], and is shaped like a butterfly, with two wings connected by a central {{wt|en|isthmus}}. Thyroid tissue consists of follicles with stored protein called colloid, containing[thyroglobulin], a precursor to other thyroid hormones, which are manufactured within the colloid.\n\nThe [[thyroid hormone]]s increase the rate of [[metabolism|cellular metabolism]], and include [[thyroxine]] (T4) and [[triiodothyronine]] (T3). Secretion is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone, secreted by the anterior pituitary. When thyroid levels are high, there is negative feedback that decreases the amount of Thyroid-stimulating hormone secreted. Most T4 is converted to T3 (a more active form) in the target tissues.\n\n[[Calcitonin]], produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland in response to rising blood calcium levels, depresses blood calcium levels by inhibiting bone matrix resorption and enhancing calcium deposit in bones.\nExcessive secretion cause hyperthyroidism and deficiency cause hypothyroidism.\n\n===Parathyroid glands===\n{{Main|Parathyroid gland}}\nThe parathyroid glands, of which there are 4\u20136, are found on the back of the thyroid glands, and secrete [[parathyroid hormone]],<ref>[http://www.unomaha.edu/hpa/endocrinehistology.html Endocrinology: Tissue Histology.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204054021/http://www.unomaha.edu/hpa/endocrinehistology.html |date=2010-02-04 }} ''[[University of Nebraska at Omaha]].''</ref> which causes an increase in blood calcium levels by targeting bone, the intestine, and the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone is the antagonist of [[calcitonin]]. Parathyroid hormone release is triggered by falling blood calcium levels and is inhibited by rising blood calcium levels.\n\n===Adrenal glands===\n{{Main|Adrenal gland}}\nThe adrenal glands are located above the kidneys in humans and\nin front of the kidneys in other animals. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones including [[adrenaline]] and the steroids [[aldosterone]] and [[cortisol]].<ref name=dictionary>{{cite web|title=Adrenal gland|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/adrenal%20gland|website=Medline Plus/Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> It controls the behaviour during crisis and emotional situations. It stimulates the heart and its conducting tissues and metabolic processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKollam Poli sanam\n\n===Pancreas===\n{{Main|Pancreas}}\nThe pancreas, located in the abdomen, below and behind the stomach, is both an [[Exocrine gland|exocrine]] and an endocrine gland. The [[alpha cell|alpha]] and [[beta cell]]s are the endocrine cells in the [[pancreatic islets]] that release [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]] and smaller amounts of other hormones into the blood. Insulin and glucagon influence [[blood sugar level]]s. Glucagon is released when blood glucose level is low, and stimulates the liver to release [[glucose]] into the blood. Insulin increases the rate of glucose uptake and metabolism by most body cells.\n\n[[Somatostatin]] is released by [[delta cell]]s and acts as an inhibitor of GH, insulin and glucagon.\n\n===Gonads===\n{{Main|Gonad}}\nThe ovaries of the female, located in the pelvic cavity, release two main hormones. Secretion of [[estrogen]]s by the ovarian follicles begins at [[puberty]] under the influence of follicle-stimulating hormone. Estrogens stimulate maturation of the female reproductive system and development of the secondary sexual characteristics. [[Progesterone]] is released in response to high blood levels of luteinizing hormone. It works with estrogens in establishing the [[menstrual cycle]].\n\nThe testes of the male begin to produce [[testosterone]] at puberty in response to luteinizing hormone. Testosterone promotes maturation of the male reproductive organs, development of secondary sex characteristics such as beard, hoarse voice, etc. and production of sperm by the testes.\n\n===Pineal gland===\n{{Main|Pineal gland}}\nThe pineal gland is located in the [[diencephalon]] of the brain. It primarily releases [[melatonin]], which influences daily rhythms and may have an [[antigonadotropic]] effect in humans.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} It may also influence the melanotropes and melanocytes located in the skin.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Other hormone-producing structures===\nMany body organs not normally considered endocrine organs contain isolated cell clusters that secrete hormones. Examples include the [[heart]] ([[atrial natriuretic peptide]]); [[gastrointestinal tract]] organs ([[gastrin]], [[secretin]], and others); the [[placenta]] (hormones of pregnancy\u2014[[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], and others); the [[kidney]]s ([[erythropoietin]] and [[renin]]); the [[thymus]]; [[skin]] ([[cholecalciferol]]); and [[adipose tissue]] ([[leptin]] and [[resistin]]).\n\n==Development==\n{{main|Development of the endocrine system}}\n\nEndocrine glands derive from all three germ layers.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe natural decrease in function of the female's ovaries during late middle age results in [[menopause]]. The efficiency of all endocrine glands seems to decrease gradually as aging occurs. This leads to a generalized increase in the incidence of [[diabetes mellitus]] and a lower [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]].\n\n==Function==\n===Hormones===\n{{main|Hormone}}\nLocal chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include [[Autocrine signalling|autocrine]]s, which act on the cells that secrete them, and [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine]]s, which act on a different cell type nearby.\n\nThe ability of a target cell to respond to a hormone depends on the presence of receptors, within the cell or on its plasma membrane, to which the hormone can bind.\n\nHormone receptors are dynamic structures. Changes in number and sensitivity of hormone receptors may occur in response to high or low levels of stimulating hormones.\n\nBlood levels of hormones reflect a balance between [[secretion]] and degradation/[[excretion]]. The [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s are the major organs that degrade hormones; breakdown products are excreted in urine and feces.\n\nHormone half-life and duration of activity are limited and vary from hormone to hormone.\n\nInteraction of hormones at target cells\n''[[Permissiveness (biology)|Permissiveness]]'' is the situation in which a hormone cannot exert its full effects without the presence of another hormone.\n\n''[[Synergy|Synergism]]'' occurs when two or more hormones produce the same effects in a target cell and their results are amplified.\n\n''[[Antagonism (chemistry)|Antagonism]]'' occurs when a hormone opposes or reverses the effect of another hormone.\n\n===Control===\n{{main|Endocrine system}}\nThe endocrine glands belong to the body's control system.  The hormones which they produce help to regulate the functions of cells and tissues throughout the body.  Endocrine organs are activated to release their hormones by humoral, neural or hormonal stimuli. Negative feedback is important in regulating [[hormone]] levels in the blood.\n\nThe [[nervous system]], acting through hypothalamic controls, can in certain cases override or modulate hormonal effects.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n===Disease===\n[[File:Endocrine disorders world map - DALY - WHO2002.svg|thumb|[[Disability-adjusted life year]] for endocrine disorders per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/statistics/bodgbddeathdalyestimates.xls |title=Mortality and Burden of Disease Estimates for WHO Member States in 2002|format=xls |work=World Health Organization|year=2002 |accessdate=}}</ref>{{refbegin|2}}\n{{legend|#b3b3b3|no data}}\n{{legend|#ffff65|less than 80}}\n{{legend|#fff200|80\u2013160}}\n{{legend|#ffdc00|160\u2013240}}\n{{legend|#ffc600|240\u2013320}}\n{{legend|#ffb000|320\u2013400}}\n{{legend|#ff9a00|400\u2013480}}\n{{legend|#ff8400|480\u2013560}}\n{{legend|#ff6e00|560\u2013640}}\n{{legend|#ff5800|640\u2013720}}\n{{legend|#ff4200|720\u2013800}}\n{{legend|#ff2c00|800\u20131000}}\n{{legend|#cb0000|more than 1000}}\n{{refend}}]]\n{{Main|Endocrine diseases}}\n[[Endocrine diseases|Diseases of the endocrine glands]] are common,<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Kasper\n  | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine\n  | publisher = [[McGraw Hill]]\n  | year = 2005 \n  | pages = 2074\n  | isbn =978-0-07-139140-5\n   }}</ref> including conditions such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[thyroid]] disease, and [[obesity]].\n\nEndocrine disease is characterized by irregulated hormone release (a productive [[pituitary adenoma]]), inappropriate response to signaling  ([[hypothyroidism]]), lack of a gland ([[diabetes mellitus type 1]], diminished [[erythropoiesis]] in [[chronic kidney failure]]), or structural enlargement in a critical site such as the thyroid ([[toxic multinodular goitre]]). Hypofunction of endocrine glands can occur as a result of loss of reserve, hyposecretion, [[agenesis]], atrophy, or active destruction. Hyperfunction can occur as a result of hypersecretion, loss of suppression, [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]] or [[neoplastic]] change, or hyperstimulation.\n\nEndocrinopathies are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary endocrine disease inhibits the action of downstream glands. Secondary endocrine disease is indicative of a problem with the pituitary gland. Tertiary endocrine disease is associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamus and its releasing hormones.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nAs the [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]], and hormones have been implicated in signaling distant tissues to proliferate, for example, the [[estrogen receptor]] has been shown to be involved in certain [[breast cancer]]s. Endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine signaling have all been implicated in proliferation, one of the required steps of [[oncogenesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bhowmick NA, Chytil A, Plieth D, Gorska AE, Dumont N, Shappell S, Washington MK, Neilson EG, Moses HL |title=TGF-beta signaling in fibroblasts modulates the oncogenic potential of adjacent epithelia |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5659 |pages=848\u201351 |year=2004 |pmid=14764882 |doi=10.1126/science.1090922 |bibcode=2004Sci...303..848B }}</ref>\n\nOther common diseases that result from endocrine dysfunction include [[Addison's disease|Addison's disease]], [[Cushing's disease|Cushing's disease]] and [[Graves' disease|Grave's disease]]. Cushing's disease and Addison's disease are pathologies involving the dysfunction of the adrenal gland. Dysfunction in the adrenal gland could be due to primary or secondary factors and can result in hypercortisolism or hypocortisolism. Cushing's disease is characterized by the hypersecretion of the adrenocorticotropic hormone due to a pituitary adenoma that ultimately causes endogenous hypercortisolism by stimulating the adrenal glands.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Buliman A, Tataranu LG, Paun DL, Mirica A, Dumitrache C | year = 2016 | title = Cushing's disease: a multidisciplinary overview of the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment | url = | journal = Journal of Medicine & Life | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 12\u201318 }}</ref> Some clinical signs of Cushing's disease include obesity, moon face, and hirsutism.<ref name=\":1\">Vander, Arthur (2008).

The major glands of the endocrine system include the [[pineal gland]], [[pituitary gland]], [[pancreas]], [[Ovary|ovaries]], [[Testicle|testes]], [[thyroid|thyroid gland]], [[parathyroid gland]], [[hypothalamus]] and [[adrenal gland]]s. The hypothalamus and pituitary glands are [[neuroendocrine]] [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.\n\n[[File:Endocrine central nervous en.svg|thumb|350px| Endocrine glands in the human head and neck and their hormones]]\n{{Main|Pituitary gland}}\nThe [[pituitary gland]] hangs from the base of the [[brain]] by the [[pituitary stalk]], and is enclosed by bone. It consists of a hormone-producing glandular portion the [[anterior pituitary]] and a neural portion the [[posterior pituitary]], which is an extension of the [[hypothalamus]]. The hypothalamus regulates the hormonal output of the anterior pituitary and creates two hormones that it exports to the posterior pituitary for storage and later release.\n\nFour of the six anterior pituitary hormones are [[tropic hormone]]s that regulate the function of other endocrine organs. Most anterior pituitary hormones exhibit a diurnal rhythm of release, which is subject to modification by stimuli influencing the hypothalamus.\n\nSomatotropic hormone or [[growth hormone]] (GH) is an [[anabolism|anabolic hormone]] that stimulates growth of all body tissues  especially skeletal muscle and bone. It may act directly, or indirectly via [[insulin-like growth factor]]s (IGFs). GH mobilizes fats, stimulates protein synthesis, and inhibits glucose uptake and metabolism. Secretion is regulated by [[growth hormone releasing hormone]] (GHRH) and [[Somatostatin|growth hormone inhibiting hormone]] (GHIH), or somatostatin. Hypersecretion causes [[gigantism]] in children and [[acromegaly]] in adults; [[hyposecretion]] in children causes [[Growth hormone deficiency|pituitary dwarfism]].\n\n[[Thyroid-stimulating hormone]] promotes normal development and activity of the [[thyroid gland]]. [[Thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] stimulates its release; negative feedback of thyroid hormone inhibits it.\n\n[[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]] stimulates the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[corticosteroids]]. Adrenocorticotropic hormone release is triggered by [[corticotropin]]-releasing hormone and inhibited by rising [[glucocorticoid]] levels.\n\nThe [[gonadotropin]]s\u2014[[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and [[luteinizing hormone]] regulate the functions of the gonads in both sexes. Follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates sex cell production; luteinizing hormone stimulates [[gonadal hormone]] production. Gonadotropin levels rise in response to [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]]. Negative feedback of gonadal hormones inhibits gonadotropin release.\n\n[[Prolactin]] promotes milk production in human females. Its secretion is prompted by [[PRLH|prolactin-releasing hormone]] and inhibited by [[prolactin-inhibiting hormone]].\n\nThe intermediate lobe of pituitary gland secretes only one enzyme that is [[melanocyte stimulating hormone]]. It is linked with the formation of the black pigment in our skin called melanin.\n\nThe [[Posterior pituitary|neurohypophysis]] stores and releases two hypothalamic hormones:\n* [[Oxytocin]] stimulates powerful uterine contractions, which trigger labor and delivery of an infant, and milk ejection in nursing women. Its release is mediated reflexively by the hypothalamus and represents a positive feedback mechanism.\n* [[Vasopressin|Antidiuretic hormone]] stimulates the kidney tubules to reabsorb and conserve water, resulting in small volumes of highly concentrated urine and decreased plasma osmolarity. Antidiuretic hormone is released in response to high solute concentrations in the blood and inhibited by low solute concentrations in the blood. Hyposecretion results in diabetes insipidus.\n\n===Thyroid gland===\n{{Main|Thyroid}}\nThe thyroid gland is located at the front of the neck, in front of the [[thyroid cartilage]], and is shaped like a butterfly, with two wings connected by a central {{wt|en|isthmus}}. Thyroid tissue consists of follicles with stored protein called colloid, containing[thyroglobulin], a precursor to other thyroid hormones, which are manufactured within the colloid.\n\nThe [[thyroid hormone]]s increase the rate of [[metabolism|cellular metabolism]], and include [[thyroxine]] (T4) and [[triiodothyronine]] (T3). Secretion is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone, secreted by the anterior pituitary. When thyroid levels are high, there is negative feedback that decreases the amount of Thyroid-stimulating hormone secreted. Most T4 is converted to T3 (a more active form) in the target tissues.\n\n[[Calcitonin]], produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland in response to rising blood calcium levels, depresses blood calcium levels by inhibiting bone matrix resorption and enhancing calcium deposit in bones.\nExcessive secretion cause hyperthyroidism and deficiency cause hypothyroidism.\n\n===Parathyroid glands===\n{{Main|Parathyroid gland}}\nThe parathyroid glands, of which there are 4\u20136, are found on the back of the thyroid glands, and secrete [[parathyroid hormone]],<ref>[http://www.unomaha.edu/hpa/endocrinehistology.html Endocrinology: Tissue Histology.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204054021/http://www.unomaha.edu/hpa/endocrinehistology.html |date=2010-02-04 }} ''[[University of Nebraska at Omaha]].''</ref> which causes an increase in blood calcium levels by targeting bone, the intestine, and the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone is the antagonist of [[calcitonin]]. Parathyroid hormone release is triggered by falling blood calcium levels and is inhibited by rising blood calcium levels.\n\n===Adrenal glands===\n{{Main|Adrenal gland}}\nThe adrenal glands are located above the kidneys in humans and\nin front of the kidneys in other animals. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones including [[adrenaline]] and the steroids [[aldosterone]] and [[cortisol]].<ref name=dictionary>{{cite web|title=Adrenal gland|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/adrenal%20gland|website=Medline Plus/Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> It controls the behaviour during crisis and emotional situations. It stimulates the heart and its conducting tissues and metabolic processes.\n\n===Pancreas===\n{{Main|Pancreas}}\nThe pancreas, located in the abdomen, below and behind the stomach, is both an [[Exocrine gland|exocrine]] and an endocrine gland. The [[alpha cell|alpha]] and [[beta cell]]s are the endocrine cells in the [[pancreatic islets]] that release [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]] and smaller amounts of other hormones into the blood. Insulin and glucagon influence [[blood sugar level]]s. Glucagon is released when blood glucose level is low, and stimulates the liver to release [[glucose]] into the blood. Insulin increases the rate of glucose uptake and metabolism by most body cells.\n\n[[Somatostatin]] is released by [[delta cell]]s and acts as an inhibitor of GH, insulin and glucagon.\n\n===Gonads===\n{{Main|Gonad}}\nThe ovaries of the female, located in the pelvic cavity, release two main hormones. Secretion of [[estrogen]]s by the ovarian follicles begins at [[puberty]] under the influence of follicle-stimulating hormone. Estrogens stimulate maturation of the female reproductive system and development of the secondary sexual characteristics. [[Progesterone]] is released in response to high blood levels of luteinizing hormone. It works with estrogens in establishing the [[menstrual cycle]].\n\nThe testes of the male begin to produce [[testosterone]] at puberty in response to luteinizing hormone. Testosterone promotes maturation of the male reproductive organs, development of secondary sex characteristics such as beard, hoarse voice, etc. and production of sperm by the testes.\n\n===Pineal gland===\n{{Main|Pineal gland}}\nThe pineal gland is located in the [[diencephalon]] of the brain. It primarily releases [[melatonin]], which influences daily rhythms and may have an [[antigonadotropic]] effect in humans.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} It may also influence the melanotropes and melanocytes located in the skin.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Other hormone-producing structures===\nMany body organs not normally considered endocrine organs contain isolated cell clusters that secrete hormones. Examples include the [[heart]] ([[atrial natriuretic peptide]]); [[gastrointestinal tract]] organs ([[gastrin]], [[secretin]], and others); the [[placenta]] (hormones of pregnancy\u2014[[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], and others); the [[kidney]]s ([[erythropoietin]] and [[renin]]); the [[thymus]]; [[skin]] ([[cholecalciferol]]); and [[adipose tissue]] ([[leptin]] and [[resistin]]).\n\n==Development==\n{{main|Development of the endocrine system}}\n\nEndocrine glands derive from all three germ layers.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe natural decrease in function of the female's ovaries during late middle age results in [[menopause]]. The efficiency of all endocrine glands seems to decrease gradually as aging occurs. This leads to a generalized increase in the incidence of [[diabetes mellitus]] and a lower [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]].\n\n==Function==\n===Hormones===\n{{main|Hormone}}\nLocal chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include [[Autocrine signalling|autocrine]]s, which act on the cells that secrete them, and [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine]]s, which act on a different cell type nearby.\n\nThe ability of a target cell to respond to a hormone depends on the presence of receptors, within the cell or on its plasma membrane, to which the hormone can bind.\n\nHormone receptors are dynamic structures. Changes in number and sensitivity of hormone receptors may occur in response to high or low levels of stimulating hormones.\n\nBlood levels of hormones reflect a balance between [[secretion]] and degradation/[[excretion]]. The [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s are the major organs that degrade hormones; breakdown products are excreted in urine and feces.\n\nHormone half-life and duration of activity are limited and vary from hormone to hormone.\n\nInteraction of hormones at target cells\n''[[Permissiveness (biology)|Permissiveness]]'' is the situation in which a hormone cannot exert its full effects without the presence of another hormone.\n\n''[[Synergy|Synergism]]'' occurs when two or more hormones produce the same effects in a target cell and their results are amplified.\n\n''[[Antagonism (chemistry)|Antagonism]]'' occurs when a hormone opposes or reverses the effect of another hormone.\n\n===Control===\n{{main|Endocrine system}}\nThe endocrine glands belong to the body's control system.  The hormones which they produce help to regulate the functions of cells and tissues throughout the body.  Endocrine organs are activated to release their hormones by humoral, neural or hormonal stimuli. Negative feedback is important in regulating [[hormone]] levels in the blood.\n\nThe [[nervous system]], acting through hypothalamic controls, can in certain cases override or modulate hormonal effects.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n===Disease===\n[[File:Endocrine disorders world map - DALY - WHO2002.svg|thumb|[[Disability-adjusted life year]] for endocrine disorders per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/statistics/bodgbddeathdalyestimates.xls |title=Mortality and Burden of Disease Estimates for WHO Member States in 2002|format=xls |work=World Health Organization|year=2002 |accessdate=}}</ref>{{refbegin|2}}\n{{legend|#b3b3b3|no data}}\n{{legend|#ffff65|less than 80}}\n{{legend|#fff200|80\u2013160}}\n{{legend|#ffdc00|160\u2013240}}\n{{legend|#ffc600|240\u2013320}}\n{{legend|#ffb000|320\u2013400}}\n{{legend|#ff9a00|400\u2013480}}\n{{legend|#ff8400|480\u2013560}}\n{{legend|#ff6e00|560\u2013640}}\n{{legend|#ff5800|640\u2013720}}\n{{legend|#ff4200|720\u2013800}}\n{{legend|#ff2c00|800\u20131000}}\n{{legend|#cb0000|more than 1000}}\n{{refend}}]]\n{{Main|Endocrine diseases}}\n[[Endocrine diseases|Diseases of the endocrine glands]] are common,<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Kasper\n  | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine\n  | publisher = [[McGraw Hill]]\n  | year = 2005 \n  | pages = 2074\n  | isbn =978-0-07-139140-5\n   }}</ref> including conditions such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[thyroid]] disease, and [[obesity]].\n\nEndocrine disease is characterized by irregulated hormone release (a productive [[pituitary adenoma]]), inappropriate response to signaling  ([[hypothyroidism]]), lack of a gland ([[diabetes mellitus type 1]], diminished [[erythropoiesis]] in [[chronic kidney failure]]), or structural enlargement in a critical site such as the thyroid ([[toxic multinodular goitre]]). Hypofunction of endocrine glands can occur as a result of loss of reserve, hyposecretion, [[agenesis]], atrophy, or active destruction. Hyperfunction can occur as a result of hypersecretion, loss of suppression, [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]] or [[neoplastic]] change, or hyperstimulation.\n\nEndocrinopathies are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary endocrine disease inhibits the action of downstream glands. Secondary endocrine disease is indicative of a problem with the pituitary gland. Tertiary endocrine disease is associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamus and its releasing hormones.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nAs the [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]], and hormones have been implicated in signaling distant tissues to proliferate, for example, the [[estrogen receptor]] has been shown to be involved in certain [[breast cancer]]s.

Cushing's disease and Addison's disease are pathologies involving the dysfunction of the adrenal gland. Dysfunction in the adrenal gland could be due to primary or secondary factors and can result in hypercortisolism or hypocortisolism.
