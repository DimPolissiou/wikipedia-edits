The three duos distrusted one another and kept to themselves,<ref>Guinn, pp. 335\u201336</ref> and each had its own agenda in the operation and offered differing narratives of it. Simmons, the head of the Texas DOC, brought another perspective, having effectively commissioned the posse.\n\nSchmid had tried to arrest Barrow in Sowers, Texas in November 1933. Schmid called \"Halt!\" and gunfire erupted from the outlaw car, which made a quick U-turn and sped away. Schmid's Thompson submachine gun jammed on the first round, and he could not get off one shot.

To sweeten the deal, Texas Department of Corrections boss Lee Simmons granted him title to all the guns that the posse would recover from the slain murderers. Almost all the guns, which the gang had stolen from armories, were the property of the National Guard. There was a thriving market for \"celebrity\" guns, even in 1934 (Guinn, p. 343).</ref> In July, Clyde's mother Cumie wrote to Hamer asking for the return of the guns: \"You don't never want to forget my boy was never tried in no court for murder, and no one is guilty until proven guilty by some court so I hope you will answer this letter and also return the guns I am asking for.\"<ref name=tre224>Treherne, p.  224</ref> There is no record of any response.<ref name=tre224 />\n\nAlcorn claimed Barrow's [[saxophone]] from the car, but he later donated it to the Barrow family.<ref name=\"Guinn, p 343\">Guinn, p. 343</ref> Posse members also took other personal items, such as Parker's clothing.
