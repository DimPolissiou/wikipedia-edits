Sterilizers may be heat only, steam, or liquid chemical.<ref name=\"miller\">{{cite book |author=Miller, Chris H. |title=Infection control and management of hazardous materials for the dental team |edition=4th |publisher=Mosby Elsevier Health Science |year=2010 |chapter=11 }}</ref>\nEffectiveness of the sterilizer (e.g., a steam autoclave) is determined in three ways.<ref name=\"miller\"/>\nFirst, mechanical indicators and gauges on the machine itself indicate proper operation of the machine. Second heat sensitive indicators or tape on the sterilizing bags change color which indicate proper levels of heat or steam. And, third (most importantly) is biological testing in which a microorganism that is highly heat and chemical resistant (often the bacterial endospore) is selected as the standard challenge. If the process kills this microorganism, the sterilizer is considered to be effective.<ref name=\"miller\"/>\n\nSterilization, if performed properly, is an effective way of preventing [[bacteria]] from spreading. It should be used for the cleaning of the medical instruments or [[gloves]], and basically any type of medical item that comes into contact with the [[blood stream]] and sterile tissues.\n\nThere are four main ways in which such items can be sterilized: [[autoclave]] (by using high-pressure [[steam]]), dry [[heat]] (in an oven), by using chemical sterilants such as glutaraldehydes or [[formaldehyde]] solutions or by [[radiation]] (with the help of physical agents). The first two are the most used methods of sterilizations mainly because of their accessibility and availability. Steam sterilization is one of the most effective types of sterilizations, if done correctly which is often hard to achieve. Instruments that are used in [[health care facilities]] are usually sterilized with this method. The general rule in this case is that in order to perform an effective sterilization, the steam must get into contact with all the surfaces that are meant to be disinfected. On the other hand, dry heat sterilization, which is performed with the help of an oven, is also an accessible type of sterilization, although it can only be used to disinfect instruments that are made of [[metal]] or [[glass]]. The very high [[temperatures]] needed to perform sterilization in this way are able to melt the instruments that are not made of glass or metal.\n\nSteam sterilization is done at a temperature of 121 C (250 F) with a pressure of 209 kPa (15&nbsp;lbs/in2). In these conditions, rubber items must be sterilized for 20 minutes, and wrapped items 134 C with pressure of 310 kPa for 7 minutes. The time is counted once the temperature that is needed has been reached. Steam sterilization requires four conditions in order to be efficient: adequate contact, sufficiently high temperature, correct time and sufficient [[moisture]].<ref name=\"Sterilization\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/4morerh/4ip/IP_manual/11_Sterilization.pdf |title=Sterilization |date= |accessdate=27 July 2010 }}</ref> Sterilization using steam can also be done at a temperature of 132 C (270 F), at a double pressure. Dry heat sterilization is performed at 170 C (340 F) for one hour or two hours at a temperature of 160 C (320 F). Dry heat sterilization can also be performed at 121 C, for at least 16 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/black12.htm |title=Eliminating microbes |accessdate=27 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724144955/http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/black12.htm |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChemical sterilization, also referred to as cold sterilization, can be used to sterilize instruments that cannot normally be disinfected through the other two processes described above. The items sterilized with cold sterilization are usually those that can be damaged by regular sterilization. Commonly, glutaraldehydes and formaldehyde are used in this process, but in different ways. When using the first type of disinfectant, the instruments are soaked in a 2\u20134% solution for at least 10 hours while a solution of 8% formaldehyde will sterilize the items in 24 hours or more. Chemical sterilization is generally more expensive than steam sterilization and therefore it is used for instruments that cannot be disinfected otherwise. After the instruments have been soaked in the chemical solutions, they are mandatory to be rinsed with sterile water which will remove the residues from the [[disinfectants]]. This is the reason why [[Hypodermic needle|needles]] and [[syringes]] are not sterilized in this way, as the residues left by the chemical solution that has been used to disinfect them cannot be washed off with [[water]] and they may interfere with the administered treatment. Although formaldehyde is less expensive than glutaraldehydes, it is also more irritating to the [[Human eyes|eyes]], [[Human skin|skin]] and [[respiratory tract]] and is classified as a potential [[carcinogen]].<ref name=\"Sterilization\"/>\n\nOther sterilization methods exist, though their efficiency is still controversial. These methods include [[gas]], UV, [[gas plasma]], and chemical sterilization with agents such as [[peroxyacetic acid]] or [[paraformaldehyde]].\n\n===Cleaning===\nInfections can be prevented from occurring in homes as well. In order to reduce their chances to contract an infection, individuals are recommended to maintain a good hygiene by washing their hands after every contact with questionable areas or bodily fluids and by disposing of [[waste|garbage]] at regular intervals to prevent [[Microorganism|germs]] from growing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.preventinginfection.com/ |title=Preventing infections adequately |date= |accessdate=27 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610065935/http://www.preventinginfection.com/ |archive-date=10 June 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Disinfection===\nDisinfection uses liquid chemicals on surfaces and at room temperature to kill disease causing microorganisms.

The hazard in a health care setting is exposure to blood, saliva, or other bodily fluids or aerosols that may carry infectious materials such as [[Hepatitis C]], [[HIV]], or other blood borne or bodily fluid [[pathogen]]. PPE prevents contact with a potentially infectious material by creating a physical barrier between the potential infectious material and the healthcare worker.<ref>Khalid M. \"Infection Prevention and Control: General Principles and Role of Microbiology Laboratory\".

Determining the presence of a hospital acquired  infection requires an infection control practitioner (ICP) to review a patient's chart and see if the patient had the signs and symptom of an infection. Surveillance definitions exist for infections of the bloodstream, urinary tract, pneumonia, surgical sites and gastroenteritis.\n\nSurveillance traditionally involved significant manual data assessment and entry in order to assess preventative actions such as isolation of patients with an infectious disease. Increasingly, computerized software solutions are becoming available that assess incoming risk messages from microbiology and other online sources. By reducing the need for data entry, software can reduce the data workload of ICPs, freeing them to concentrate on clinical surveillance.\n\nAs of 1998, approximately one third of healthcare acquired infections were preventable.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/3/98-0320 |publisher=CDC |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=September 1998 |author=Weinstein RA |title=Nosocomial Infection Update | doi = 10.3201/eid0403.980320 |pages=416\u2013420|pmc=2640303 |pmid=9716961 }}</ref> Surveillance and preventative activities are increasingly a priority for hospital staff.

Various forms of isolation exist, and are applied depending on the type of infection and agent involved, to address the likelihood of spread via airborne particles or droplets, by direct skin contact, or via contact with body fluids.\n\nIn cases where infection is merely suspected, individuals may be [[quarantined]] until the incubation period has passed and the disease manifests itself or the person remains healthy. Groups may undergo quarantine, or in the case of communities, a [[cordon sanitaire]] may be imposed to prevent infection from spreading beyond the community, or in the case of [[protective sequestration]], into a community. Public health authorities may implement other forms of [[social distancing]], such as school closings, to control an epidemic.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/od/science/integrity/phethics/docs/panflu_ethic_guidelines.pdf Kathy Kinlaw, Robert Levine, \"Ethical Guidelines on Pandemic Influenza,\" ''CDC'', December 2006]</ref>\n\n==Outbreak investigation==\nWhen an unusual cluster of illness is noted, infection control teams undertake an investigation to determine whether there is a true outbreak, a pseudo-outbreak (a result of contamination within the diagnostic testing process), or just random fluctuation in the frequency of illness.  If a true outbreak is discovered, infection control practitioners try to determine what permitted the outbreak to occur, and to rearrange the conditions to prevent ongoing propagation of the infection.  Often, breaches in good practice are responsible, although sometimes other factors (such as construction) may be the source of the problem.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Disease_outbreak#Outbreak_investigation|Outbreaks investigations]] have more than a single purpose. These investigations are carried out in order to prevent additional cases in the current outbreak, prevent future outbreaks, learn about a new disease or learn something new about an old disease. Reassuring the public, minimizing the economic and social disruption as well as teaching [[epidemiology]] are some other obvious objectives of outbreak investigations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idready.org/slides/03outbreak-slides.pdf|title=Conducting an Outbreak Investigation|accessdate=2010-07-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331173846/http://www.idready.org/slides/03outbreak-slides.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[WHO]], outbreak investigations are meant to detect what is causing the outbreak, how the pathogenic agent is transmitted, where it all started from, what is the carrier, what is the population at risk of getting infected and what are the risk factors.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Training in infection control and health care epidemiology==\nPractitioners can come from several different educational streams. Many begin as nurses, some as medical technologists (particularly in clinical microbiology), and some as physicians (typically infectious disease specialists). Specialized training in infection control and health care epidemiology are offered by the professional organizations described below. Physicians who desire to become infection control practitioners often are trained in the context of an infectious disease fellowship.\n\nIn the United States, Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology is a private company that certifies infection control practitioners based on their educational background and professional experience, in conjunction with testing their knowledge base with standardized exams.

Sterilizers may be heat only, steam, or liquid chemical.<ref name=\"miller\">{{cite book |author=Miller, Chris H. |title=Infection control and management of hazardous materials for the dental team |edition=4th |publisher=Mosby Elsevier Health Science |year=2010 |chapter=11 }}</ref>\nEffectiveness of the sterilizer (e.g., a steam autoclave) is determined in three ways.<ref name=\"miller\"/>\nFirst, mechanical indicators and gauges on the machine itself indicate proper operation of the machine. Second heat sensitive indicators or tape on the sterilizing bags change color which indicate proper levels of heat or steam. And, third (most importantly) is biological testing in which a microorganism that is highly heat and chemical resistant (often the bacterial endospore) is selected as the standard challenge. If the process kills this microorganism, the sterilizer is considered to be effective.<ref name=\"miller\"/>\n\nSterilization, if performed properly, is an effective way of preventing [[bacteria]] from spreading. It should be used for the cleaning of the medical instruments or [[gloves]], and basically any type of medical item that comes into contact with the [[blood stream]] and sterile tissues.\n\nThere are four main ways in which such items can be sterilized: [[autoclave]] (by using high-pressure [[steam]]), dry [[heat]] (in an oven), by using chemical sterilants such as glutaraldehydes or [[formaldehyde]] solutions or by [[radiation]] (with the help of physical agents). The first two are the most used methods of sterilizations mainly because of their accessibility and availability. Steam sterilization is one of the most effective types of sterilizations, if done correctly which is often hard to achieve. Instruments that are used in [[health care facilities]] are usually sterilized with this method. The general rule in this case is that in order to perform an effective sterilization, the steam must get into contact with all the surfaces that are meant to be disinfected. On the other hand, dry heat sterilization, which is performed with the help of an oven, is also an accessible type of sterilization, although it can only be used to disinfect instruments that are made of [[metal]] or [[glass]]. The very high [[temperatures]] needed to perform sterilization in this way are able to melt the instruments that are not made of glass or metal.\n\nSteam sterilization is done at a temperature of 121 C (250 F) with a pressure of 209 kPa (15&nbsp;lbs/in2). In these conditions, rubber items must be sterilized for 20 minutes, and wrapped items 134 C with pressure of 310 kPa for 7 minutes. The time is counted once the temperature that is needed has been reached. Steam sterilization requires four conditions in order to be efficient: adequate contact, sufficiently high temperature, correct time and sufficient [[moisture]].<ref name=\"Sterilization\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/4morerh/4ip/IP_manual/11_Sterilization.pdf |title=Sterilization |date= |accessdate=27 July 2010 }}</ref> Sterilization using steam can also be done at a temperature of 132 C (270 F), at a double pressure. Dry heat sterilization is performed at 170 C (340 F) for one hour or two hours at a temperature of 160 C (320 F). Dry heat sterilization can also be performed at 121 C, for at least 16 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/black12.htm |title=Eliminating microbes |accessdate=27 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724144955/http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/black12.htm |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChemical sterilization, also referred to as cold sterilization, can be used to sterilize instruments that cannot normally be disinfected through the other two processes described above. The items sterilized with cold sterilization are usually those that can be damaged by regular sterilization. Commonly, glutaraldehydes and formaldehyde are used in this process, but in different ways. When using the first type of disinfectant, the instruments are soaked in a 2\u20134% solution for at least 10 hours while a solution of 8% formaldehyde will sterilize the items in 24 hours or more. Chemical sterilization is generally more expensive than steam sterilization and therefore it is used for instruments that cannot be disinfected otherwise. After the instruments have been soaked in the chemical solutions, they are mandatory to be rinsed with sterile water which will remove the residues from the [[disinfectants]]. This is the reason why [[Hypodermic needle|needles]] and [[syringes]] are not sterilized in this way, as the residues left by the chemical solution that has been used to disinfect them cannot be washed off with [[water]] and they may interfere with the administered treatment. Although formaldehyde is less expensive than glutaraldehydes, it is also more irritating to the [[Human eyes|eyes]], [[Human skin|skin]] and [[respiratory tract]] and is classified as a potential [[carcinogen]].<ref name=\"Sterilization\"/>\n\nOther sterilization methods exist, though their efficiency is still controversial. These methods include [[gas]], UV, [[gas plasma]], and chemical sterilization with agents such as [[peroxyacetic acid]] or [[paraformaldehyde]].\n\n===Cleaning===\nInfections can be prevented from occurring in homes as well. In order to reduce their chances to contract an infection, individuals are recommended to maintain a good hygiene by washing their hands after every contact with questionable areas or bodily fluids and by disposing of [[waste|garbage]] at regular intervals to prevent [[Microorganism|germs]] from growing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.preventinginfection.com/ |title=Preventing infections adequately |date= |accessdate=27 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610065935/http://www.preventinginfection.com/ |archive-date=10 June 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Disinfection===\nDisinfection uses liquid chemicals on surfaces and at room temperature to kill disease causing microorganisms.

Determining the presence of a hospital acquired  infection requires an infection control practitioner (ICP) to review a patient's chart and see if the patient had the signs and symptom of an infection. Surveillance definitions exist for infections of the bloodstream, urinary tract, pneumonia, surgical sites and gastroenteritis.\n\nSurveillance traditionally involved significant manual data assessment and entry in order to assess preventative actions such as isolation of patients with an infectious disease. Increasingly, computerized software solutions are becoming available that assess incoming risk messages from microbiology and other online sources. By reducing the need for data entry, software can reduce the data workload of ICPs, freeing them to concentrate on clinical surveillance.\n\nAs of 1998, approximately one third of healthcare acquired infections were preventable.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/3/98-0320 |publisher=CDC |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=September 1998 |author=Weinstein RA |title=Nosocomial Infection Update | doi = 10.3201/eid0403.980320 |pages=416\u2013420|pmc=2640303 |pmid=9716961 }}</ref> Surveillance and preventative activities are increasingly a priority for hospital staff.

Various forms of isolation exist, and are applied depending on the type of infection and agent involved, to address the likelihood of spread via airborne particles or droplets, by direct skin contact, or via contact with body fluids.\n\nIn cases where infection is merely suspected, individuals may be [[quarantined]] until the incubation period has passed and the disease manifests itself or the person remains healthy. Groups may undergo quarantine, or in the case of communities, a [[cordon sanitaire]] may be imposed to prevent infection from spreading beyond the community, or in the case of [[protective sequestration]], into a community. Public health authorities may implement other forms of [[social distancing]], such as school closings, to control an epidemic.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/od/science/integrity/phethics/docs/panflu_ethic_guidelines.pdf Kathy Kinlaw, Robert Levine, \"Ethical Guidelines on Pandemic Influenza,\" ''CDC'', December 2006]</ref>\n\n==Outbreak investigation==\nWhen an unusual cluster of illness is noted, infection control teams undertake an investigation to determine whether there is a true outbreak, a pseudo-outbreak (a result of contamination within the diagnostic testing process), or just random fluctuation in the frequency of illness.  If a true outbreak is discovered, infection control practitioners try to determine what permitted the outbreak to occur, and to rearrange the conditions to prevent ongoing propagation of the infection.  Often, breaches in good practice are responsible, although sometimes other factors (such as construction) may be the source of the problem.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Disease_outbreak#Outbreak_investigation|Outbreaks investigations]] have more than a single purpose. These investigations are carried out in order to prevent additional cases in the current outbreak, prevent future outbreaks, learn about a new disease or learn something new about an old disease. Reassuring the public, minimizing the economic and social disruption as well as teaching [[epidemiology]] are some other obvious objectives of outbreak investigations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idready.org/slides/03outbreak-slides.pdf|title=Conducting an Outbreak Investigation|accessdate=2010-07-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331173846/http://www.idready.org/slides/03outbreak-slides.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[WHO]], outbreak investigations are meant to detect what is causing the outbreak, how the pathogenic agent is transmitted, where it all started from, what is the carrier, what is the population at risk of getting infected and what are the risk factors.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Training in infection control and health care epidemiology==\nPractitioners can come from several different educational streams. Many begin as nurses, some as medical technologists (particularly in clinical microbiology), and some as physicians (typically infectious disease specialists). Specialized training in infection control and health care epidemiology are offered by the professional organizations described below. Physicians who desire to become infection control practitioners often are trained in the context of an infectious disease fellowship.\n\nIn the United States, Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology is a private company that certifies infection control practitioners based on their educational background and professional experience, in conjunction with testing their knowledge base with standardized exams. The credential awarded is CIC, Certification in Infection Control and Epidemiology.  It is recommended that one has 2 years of Infection Control experience before applying for the exam.  Certification must be renewed every five years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbic.org/about-cbic |publisher=Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology |title=About CBIC }} (official site)</ref>\n\nA course in hospital epidemiology (infection control in the hospital setting) is offered jointly each year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shea-online.org/Education.aspx |title=Education |publisher=Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712131147/http://www.shea-online.org/Education.aspx |archivedate=12 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} (official site)</ref>\n\n== Standardization ==\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn 2002, the [[Royal Australian College of General Practitioners]] published a revised standard for office-based infection control which covers the sections of managing immunisation, sterilisation and disease surveillance.<ref name=racgp>{{cite web| last =The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners| title =RACGP Infection Control Standards for Office-based Practices (4th Edition)| url =http://www.racgp.org.au/infectioncontrol| accessdate =8 November 2008| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081220163900/http://www.racgp.org.au/infectioncontrol| archivedate =20 December 2008| df =dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=sracgp>{{cite web| last =The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners| title =Slides - RACGP Infection Control Standards for Office-based Practices (4th Edition)| url =http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/PracticeSupport/StandardsforGeneralPractices/200708RACGP_Infection_Control_Standards.pdf| format =PDF| accessdate =8 November 2008| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081217113407/http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/PracticeSupport/StandardsforGeneralPractices/200708RACGP_Infection_Control_Standards.pdf| archivedate =17 December 2008| df =dmy-all}}</ref>  However, the document on the personal hygiene of health workers is only limited to hand hygiene, waste and linen management, which may not be sufficient since some of the pathogens are air-born and could be spread through air flow.<ref name=aphf>{{cite web\n  | last = Dix\n  | first = Kathy\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Airborne Pathogens in Healthcare Facilities\n  | work = \n  | publisher = \n  | date = \n  | url = http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/articles/581clinical.html\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 11 December 2008\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090802033748/http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/articles/581clinical.html\n  | archive-date = 2 August 2009\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref><ref name=turs>{{cite journal\n  | last = Nicas\n  | first = Mark\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Toward Understanding the Risk of Secondary Airborne Infection: Emission of Respirable Pathogens\n  | journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene\n  | volume = 2\n  | issue = 3\n  | pages = 143\u2013154\n  | publisher =\n  | location =\n  | year = 2005\n  | url =\n  | doi = 10.1080/15459620590918466\n  | id =\n  | pmid = 15764538\n  | last2 = Nazaroff\n  | first2 = WW\n  | last3 = Hubbard\n  | first3 = A | displayauthors = 1\n  }}</ref>\n\nSince November 1st 2019, the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care has managed the Hand Hygiene initiative in Australia, an initiative focused on improving hand hygiene practices to reduce the incidence of healthcare associated infections. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/infection-prevention-and-control/national-hand-hygiene-initiative|title=National Hand Hygiene Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\nCurrently, the federal regulation that describes infection control standards, as related to occupational exposure to potentially infectious blood and other materials, is found at 29 CFR Part 1910.1030 Bloodborne pathogens.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] |url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owalink.query_links?src_doc_type=STANDARDS&src_unique_file=1910_1030&src_anchor_name=1910.1030 |title=Bloodborne pathogens |at=1910.1030 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Pandemic prevention}}\n* {{annotated link|Transmission (medicine)}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n# 22 Devnani M, Kumar R, Sharma RK, Gupta AK.

Trego joined Kieswetter at the wicket, but the pair struggled on the damp ground. Kieswetter was particularly singled out for criticism during this stage of the match by ''ESPNcricinfo''{{'}}s Andrew McGlashan, who claimed he had a \"stodgy start\".<ref name=\"cireport\"/> Hampshire's young [[Left-arm orthodox spin|left-arm spin bowler]], Briggs, bowled well and had Trego caught at long-off in the twelfth over.<ref name=\"inn1\"/> Trego accumulated 33 runs from 24 balls; Somerset's second highest score of the innings.<ref name=\"ciscore\"/>\n\nAfter Trego's dismissal, Kieswetter began scoring more quickly, hitting 3 fours and 2 sixes to accelerate the innings before both himself and James Hildreth were dismissed in quick succession. Hildreth, who had scored 12 runs, hit a full toss from Razzaq to Christian fielding at [[Glossary of cricket terms#G|gully]], and then four balls later, Kieswetter sliced a delivery from Christian to extra cover, where it was caught by Carberry.<ref name=\"inn1\"/> Kieswetter had scored 71 from 59 balls, after taking 37 deliveries to score his first 29 runs.<ref name=\"cireport\"/> The dismissals brought two new batsmen to the crease; Buttler and Pollard.

Christian was on strike for the final delivery, and another Hampshire player had come out to act as a runner for him. Christian missed the ball, which struck his pads. Somerset appealed for [[leg before wicket]] (lbw), and the Hampshire batsmen ran a single. In the confusion and excitement, Christian himself ran, as well as his runner, meaning that he could have been run out. However, Somerset were distracted with their appeal, and did not notice.
