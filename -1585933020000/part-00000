The group's mandate is \"Dedicated to achieving recognition and equality for [[Same-sex relationships|same sex relationships]] and associated family rights through education and legal action\".  Meeting this mandate was accomplished by [[intervention (law)|intervening]] in various precedent-setting legal cases, through representation at various pride parades and most notably in suing the Canadian federal government over failure to amend 58 pieces of federal legislation that were [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|charter-infringing]] due to the definition of spouse.\n\n==Creation==\nThe Foundation is made up of community activists and lawyers.\n\nOn May 17, 1994, the Ontario Attorney General introduced the bill to provide same-sex couples with rights and obligations equal to opposite-sex common law couples. The legislation would have amended the definition of \"spouse\" in 79 provincial statutes.  The Bill was defeated by a vote of 68 to 59 on second reading on June 9, 1994.<ref>[http://www.ontla.on.ca/hansard/house_debates/35_parl/session3/l141.htm#P752_223454 Debate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050911073040/http://www.ontla.on.ca/hansard/house_debates/35_parl/session3/l141.htm#P752_223454 |date=2005-09-11 }} and vote at second reading.</ref>\n\n==Intervener==\nOn multiple occasions, the Foundation sought and was granted [[intervention (law)|intervener]] status in various court cases.  An intervener is a party that has an interest in the case, but is not either the appellant or respondent.\n\n'''[[M. v. H.]]'''\n* A lesbian couple had been in a long-term relationship. When the relationship ended, one of the women, M, made a claim for support from her former partner under the Ontario ''[[Ontario Family Law Act|Family Law Act]]''. The definition of spouse in the Act that applied to support orders did not include same-sex couples. M brought a Charter challenge to this definition. She won at the lower court level and the appeals level; the provincial government appealed each time, rather than the respondent H.  In reaction to the success of the case at the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], the [[Ontario]] government introduced and passed an Act, Bill 5, ''Amendments Because of the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in M. v. H. Act, 1999''.\n\n:[http://www.canlii.org/on/cas/onca/1996/1996onca10062.html M. v. H. - Court of Appeal for Ontario]\n:[http://www.canlii.org/on/cas/onca/1996/1996onca10328.html M. v.

Alberta|Vriend]]'''\n* [[Delwin Vriend|Delwyn Vriend]] was fired from his job at a church run college because he was gay. When he sought to bring a human rights complaint against his former employer, he was told that he could not do so because the ''Individual Rights Protection Act'' of [[Alberta]] did not protect people from discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]]. Vriend and three lesbian and gay groups then brought a Charter challenge. They claimed that the government and Legislature of Alberta were discriminating by their refusal to add protection on the basis of sexual orientation to Alberta's human rights act despite repeated calls to do so.  The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously held that the Alberta Individual Rights Protection Act treated lesbians and gay men in a discriminatory fashion and denied them equal protection and equal benefit of the law. This discrimination could not be reasonable justified in a free and democratic society.\n\n:[http://www.canlii.org/ca/cas/scc/1998/1998scc30.html Vriend v. Alberta - Supreme Court of Canada]\n\n'''Rosenberg'''\n* Two women, Nancy Rosenberg and Margaret Evans, had both received the employee benefits offered by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) for their lesbian partners. When CUPE was unable to register its plan to include same-sex survivor benefits, the two woman challenged the ''Income Tax Act'''s definition of \"spouse\". They said that they were being discriminated against under s. 15(1) of the Charter of Rights & Freedoms, which guarantees that every individual has the right to equal benefit of the law without discrimination.  The Ontario Court of Appeal, in a unanimous decision, overturned the lower court's decision and found that the restrictive definition of \"spouse\" in the Income Tax Act violated the  Charter. The Court determined that the appropriate remedy was the immediate reading in of same-sex partners into the definition of \"spouse\" as it relates to private pension plans.  The federal government decided not to appeal this decision.  This case led to amendments to the ''Income Tax Act'' recognising same-sex common-law spouses.\n\n:[http://www.canlii.org/on/cas/onca/1998/1998onca10272.html Rosenberg v.

He later wrestled for [[Texas All-Star Wrestling]] and the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] as Big Bubba.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&wrestler=472|title=Wrestlingdata.com - The World's Largest Wrestling Database|website=wrestlingdata.com|accessdate=January 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Florida Championship Wrestling (1988\u20131989)===\n\nIn September 1988, Ottman wrestled on the [[Gordon Solie]]-hosted TV shows of [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] as a heel called Big Steel Man, managed by [[Diamond Dallas Page]].

He wrestled three more dark matches that summer, defeating Paul Roma and Boris Zukhov, and losing to [[Mr Perfect]]. That September, his name was changed to '''Tugboat Tyler''', then '''Tugboat Thomas''', as he portrayed a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] on house shows, defeating the likes of [[Barry Horowitz]], [[Steve Lombardi|The Brooklyn Brawler]] and [[Jim Barrell|Boris Zhukov]].<ref name=\"1989results\">{{Cite web|url= http://thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm|title=1989 WWF results|work=The History of WWE|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref> He debuted on WWF television on the January 27, 1990 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'' under the Tugboat Thomas moniker and defeated [[Iron Mike Sharpe]]. His ring name was soon after shortened to '''Tugboat'''. His costume consisted of a red striped shirt, white pants, and a sailor's hat. Part of his gimmick included miming pulling the cord of an airhorn and making a \"Toot-toot\" noise, like a horn of a ship. On the May 20 episode of Wrestling Challenge, Hulk Hogan made a promo explaining that he personally trained Tugboat and brought him to the WWF. Following Tugboat's win on that very same show Hogan came out into the ring and raised his arm, showing his full support. Tugboat railed for fans to send encouraging letters to Hogan after Hogan was brutally attacked by Earthquake. Tugboat aided [[Hulk Hogan]] in his feud with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] and \"Canada's Strongest Man\" [[Dino Bravo]]. This coincided with a substantial push that saw Tugboat emerging victorious on television against numerous opponents. He made his pay-per-view debut at that November's [[Survivor Series (1990)|''Survivor Series'']], where he teamed with Hogan, [[Ray Traylor|The Big Boss Man]] and [[Jim Duggan|Hacksaw Jim Duggan]] to face the team of Earthquake, Dino Bravo, [[Haku (wrestler)|Haku]] and [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]].

Ottman completed the turn on the June 15 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''. Tugboat and [[The Bushwhackers]] were facing The Nasty Boys and Earthquake in a six-man tag team match when Tugboat attacked his teammates, allowing Earthquake to hit the Earthquake Splash on Bushwhacker Luke and pin him. On the June 17 episode of ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling|Prime Time Wrestling]]'', Earthquake's manager, Jimmy Hart, reintroduced Ottman as '''Typhoon''', and he and Earthquake became known as [[The Natural Disasters]].<ref name=\"1991results\"/> As part of the character change, Ottman began wearing a red, white and black singlet with a tidal wave on the front and \"Typhoon\" in black letters under it (to match the design on Earthquake's wrestling gear, seismograph lines and \"Earthquake\" in red letters across the middle).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/gallery/fredottman.html|title=Gallery - Online World of Wrestling|website=www.onlineworldofwrestling.com|accessdate=January 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Natural Disasters dumped Hart and turned into fan favorites in early 1992, feuding with Hart's new top team, [[Money Inc.]] (\"Million Dollar Man\" [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R.

He worked house shows against Terry Taylor in the spring. His final match saw him defeat [[The Predator (Horace Hogan)]] in a house show match in Tampa, FL on July 18.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm</ref>\n\n===World Championship Wrestling===\n\n====The Shockmaster incident (1993)====\nAfter departing from the WWF, Ottman found himself at the center of one of the most infamous moments in wrestling history. He had signed with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and was to make his debut in a match alongside the [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] team of [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], [[Goldust|Dustin Rhodes]] and [[Davey Boy Smith]] in the upcoming eight-man War Games match against the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] team composed of [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]], [[Big Van Vader]], [[Stevie Ray (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Kole]] at [[Fall Brawl (1993)|Fall Brawl]].\n\nOn \"A Flair for the Gold\", an [[Promo (professional wrestling)|interview]] segment hosted by [[Ric Flair]], in front of a live audience at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXIV]]'', Sting and Smith were confronted by Sid and Harlem Heat, demanding to know the identity of their new partner. Sting exclaimed, \"All I have to say is, our partner is going to shock the world, because he is none other than the Shockmaster!\" The camera then zoomed in on a section of the set where two torches set off a small pyrotechnics explosion in front of a [[Drywall|sheetrock]] wall. With a new costume consisting of a ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtrooper]] helmet painted purple and covered in silver glitter, a pair of jeans and a large, black, puffy vest, Ottman attempted to make a dramatic entrance by crashing through the wall.\n\nWhile making his entrance, Ottman tripped over a piece of lumber that was framing the set, causing him to fall forward through the wall with his helmet falling off and sliding across the floor. His face accidentally exposed, he scrambled to put the helmet back on as Vicious, restraining laughter, exclaimed \"Oh, God!\" Ottman donned the helmet and got back on his feet, shifting his weight and dusting his hands off in an attempt to shrug off the gaffe while Harlem Heat's [[Booker T (wrestler)|Kole]] asked, \"Who is this motherfucker?\" and Smith exclaimed \"He fell flat on his arse! He fell flat on his fucking arse!\". Both of these comments were audible to the live audience and television viewers, but were [[bleep censor|bleeped]] in future showings of the footage by [[WWE]]. Ottman then began gesturing toward his would-be opponents several seconds before a menacing gravelly off-screen voice (provided by [[Ole Anderson]], who could be heard laughing before speaking) started to threaten Sid and Vader. Sid Vicious, remaining in character, reacted in rage to Shockmaster, and the broadcast focused on Vicious for the duration of the voiceover. The announcers said nothing as the segment ended.\n{{quote box|width=40em|align=right|They put me in a Storm Trooper mask which they painted and covered in glitter, I couldn't see a thing.

The momentum took me through the wall and to the floor.|salign=right|\u2014 Ottman on The Shockmaster's debut<ref name=\"tugboat\"/>}}\n\nDespite generating no crowd reaction, WCW tried to continue with the [[angle (professional wrestling)|angle]], repackaging The Shockmaster character as a [[:wikt:klutz|klutz]] in a series of pre-recorded promos (featuring Ottman in different attire, without a mask and using his own voice). It was this version of the character that went on to appear as planned in the main event of Fall Brawl, teaming with Sting, Dustin Rhodes and Davey Boy Smith in the War Games match. His ring attire for his match was a plain white shirt, jeans and a white construction worker's helmet, very different to the character in its infamous debut. He entered last into the match and actually gained the victory for his team by forcing Kole to submit to a bear hug. This was the last major appearance of the character and it was abandoned soon afterwards.\n\n[[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] later claimed, on an episode of WWE 24/7's \"Legends of Wrestling\" show, the piece of lumber previously wasn't there during a successful practice run and it was later put there by [[David Crockett (wrestling)|David Crockett]] without informing Ottman. WWE, on its official website, wrote, \"There is a case to be made that The Shockmaster's debut at WCW ''Clash of the Champions XXIV'' is the greatest of all time \u2013 albeit for all the wrong reasons.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/20-memorable-debuts/page-16|title=20 memorable Superstar debuts: #6 Shockmaster|work=[[WWE]]|first=Powers|last=Kevin|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref> The organization has also described the incident as \"one of the most unintentionally funny moments in sports entertainment history,\"<ref name=\"tugboat\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wherearetheynow/tugboat|title=Catching up with Tugboat|work=[[WWE]]|first=Brett|last=Hoffman|accessdate=February 16, 2010}}</ref> and \"a debacle many still consider one of the worst gaffes in the history of sports-entertainment.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/nitrofeature|title=Wherever Nitro goes, success follows|work=[[WWE]]|first=Zack|last=Zeigler|accessdate=February 16, 2010}}</ref> While Ottman was initially displeased with the turn of events, he now finds humor in the incident.<ref name=\"tugboat\"/>\n\n====Super Shockmaster (1993&ndash;1994)====\nWCW attempted to salvage the incident by introducing a new character called ''' The Super Shockmaster.''' Also portrayed by Ottman, he was presented as The Shockmaster's nephew, and referred to the Shockmaster as \"Uncle Fred.\" Ottman left the company in January 1994. \n\nIn 2009, [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Triple H]], and Dusty Rhodes appeared on a segment of ''[[WWE Raw]]'' to discuss the DVD release of ''The Rise and Fall of WCW'' when Triple H brought up the subject of the Shockmaster's debut. During that segment, the WWE recreated the Shockmaster's stumbling through the wall, with [[Santino Marella]] portraying the character and [[Arn Anderson]] providing the voice.\n\nOn February 22, 2016, Ottman returned as The Shockmaster for an episode of the [[WWE Network]] show, ''The Edge and Christian Show That Totally Reeks of Awesomeness''. On the show, The Shockmaster was given the opportunity to redeem the famous debut incident by walking through the show's banner.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyddt.com/2016/02/22/edge-christian-show-totally-reeks-awesomeness-review-episode-1/|title=The Edge and Christian Show That Totally Reeks of Awesomeness Review: Episode 1|date=February 22, 2016|work=Daily DDT|access-date=June 10, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Return to the WWF (1994, 2001)===\nOttman returned to the WWF as Typhoon in May 1994, taking the place of his former partner Earthquake in house show matches against [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] after Earthquake left the WWF.

In December 1995, he went to Japan to compete in a one-night tag team tournament, held by [[WAR (wrestling promotion)|WAR]]. He teamed up with [[Akio Sato (wrestler)|Shinja]] and advanced to the semi-finals, before losing to [[Genichiro Tenryu]] and [[Ultimo Dragon]]. In March 1996, he wrestled a tour of [[Malaysia]] for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] \n feuding with [[King Kong Bundy]].\n\nBy the late 1990s, he was wrestling primarily in Florida, where he competed for FOW and WXO. In WXO, he was given a [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] where he was too big to get out of his own car. He lost to NWA World Heavyweight Champion [[Dan Severn]] on November 7, 1997 in Gainesville, Florida. On May 27, 2000 as Typhoon he defeated [[One Man Gang]] and [[The Harris Brothers|Ron Harris]] in a 3 way match for Wrestling In Ashwaubenon independent show in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin. In 2001 Ottman retired from wrestling.\n\n==Other media==\nIn 1992, he appeared as Typhoon (along with Earthquake) in the [[SNES]] version of the video game ''[[WWF Super Wrestlemania]]''. The Disasters were absent from the Sega version. On February 23, 2016, he appeared as downloadable content for ''[[WWE 2K16]]''. He appears along with Earthquake in ''[[WWE 2K17]] and [[WWE 2K18]]'' as well. In 2K18, the Shockmaster helmet (slightly modified as to avoid any copyright disputes with the Star Wars license) and the Typhoon singlet are available in the game's attire creation suite, and can be worn by any character in the game.\n\n==Personal life==\nOttman retired from wrestling after WXO folded in 2001. He now lives in [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]], Florida and works as a safety manager for Gaffin Industrial Services, a building cleaning service.

Tugboat was eliminated when he and Earthquake fought to a double count-out, and Hogan went on to be the sole survivor.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm|title=1990 WWF results|work=The History of WWE|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref> Tugboat was the first true test of [[The Undertaker]], who defeated him in numerous matches between December 1990 and March 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=konst&letter1=F&wrestler1=2687&letter2=U&wrestler2=124&letter3=&wrestler3=0&letter4=&wrestler4=0&matchtyp=1&anzeige=matches&seite=1|title=Wrestlingdata.com - The World's Largest Wrestling Database|website=www.wrestlingdata.com|accessdate=January 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"1991results\">{{Cite web|url= http://thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm|title=1991 WWF results|work=The History of WWE|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref> Tugboat received a shot at [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect's]] [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] on the May 5, 1991 episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]'', but was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"1991results\"/>\n\n====Natural Disasters (1991&ndash;1993)====\n{{main|The Natural Disasters}}\nIn May 1991, Ottman teased a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] by attacking Hulk Hogan in a battle royal on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXIX]]''. Ottman completed the turn on the June 15 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''. Tugboat and [[The Bushwhackers]] were facing The Nasty Boys and Earthquake in a six-man tag team match when Tugboat attacked his teammates, allowing Earthquake to hit the Earthquake Splash on Bushwhacker Luke and pin him. On the June 17 episode of ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling|Prime Time Wrestling]]'', Earthquake's manager, Jimmy Hart, reintroduced Ottman as '''Typhoon''', and he and Earthquake became known as [[The Natural Disasters]].<ref name=\"1991results\"/> As part of the character change, Ottman began wearing a red, white and black singlet with a tidal wave on the front and \"Typhoon\" in black letters under it (to match the design on Earthquake's wrestling gear, seismograph lines and \"Earthquake\" in red letters across the middle).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/gallery/fredottman.html|title=Gallery - Online World of Wrestling|website=www.onlineworldofwrestling.com|accessdate=January 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Natural Disasters dumped Hart and turned into fan favorites in early 1992, feuding with Hart's new top team, [[Money Inc.]] (\"Million Dollar Man\" [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]]). On April 17 they won the SWS Tag Team Championship defeating [[George Takano]] and Shunji Takano in Yokohama, Japan when WWF had a partnership with [[Super World of Sports]]. In July the Natural Disasters defeated Money Inc. to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]].

He worked house shows against Terry Taylor in the spring. His final match saw him defeat [[The Predator (Horace Hogan)]] in a house show match in Tampa, FL on July 18.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm</ref>\n\n===World Championship Wrestling===\n\n====The Shockmaster incident (1993)====\nAfter departing from the WWF, Ottman found himself at the center of one of the most infamous moments in wrestling history. He had signed with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and was to make his debut in a match alongside the [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] team of [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], [[Goldust|Dustin Rhodes]] and [[Davey Boy Smith]] in the upcoming eight-man War Games match against the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] team composed of [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]], [[Big Van Vader]], [[Stevie Ray (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Kole]] at [[Fall Brawl (1993)|Fall Brawl]].\n\nOn \"A Flair for the Gold\", an [[Promo (professional wrestling)|interview]] segment hosted by [[Ric Flair]], in front of a live audience at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXIV]]'', Sting and Smith were confronted by Sid and Harlem Heat, demanding to know the identity of their new partner. Sting exclaimed, \"All I have to say is, our partner is going to shock the world, because he is none other than the Shockmaster!\" The camera then zoomed in on a section of the set where two torches set off a small pyrotechnics explosion in front of a [[Drywall|sheetrock]] wall. With a new costume consisting of a ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtrooper]] helmet painted purple and covered in silver glitter, a pair of jeans and a large, black, puffy vest, Ottman attempted to make a dramatic entrance by crashing through the wall.\n\nWhile making his entrance, Ottman tripped over a piece of lumber that was framing the set, causing him to fall forward through the wall with his helmet falling off and sliding across the floor. His face accidentally exposed, he scrambled to put the helmet back on as Vicious, restraining laughter, exclaimed \"Oh, God!\" Ottman donned the helmet and got back on his feet, shifting his weight and dusting his hands off in an attempt to shrug off the gaffe while Harlem Heat's [[Booker T (wrestler)|Kole]] asked, \"Who is this motherfucker?\" and Smith exclaimed \"He fell flat on his arse! He fell flat on his fucking arse!\". Both of these comments were audible to the live audience and television viewers, but were [[bleep censor|bleeped]] in future showings of the footage by [[WWE]]. Ottman then began gesturing toward his would-be opponents several seconds before a menacing gravelly off-screen voice (provided by [[Ole Anderson]], who could be heard laughing before speaking) started to threaten Sid and Vader. Sid Vicious, remaining in character, reacted in rage to Shockmaster, and the broadcast focused on Vicious for the duration of the voiceover. The announcers said nothing as the segment ended.\n{{quote box|width=40em|align=right|They put me in a Storm Trooper mask which they painted and covered in glitter, I couldn't see a thing. I got to the wall and put my hands up like a double axe handle and bust through. The top broke perfectly, but the bottom didn't give. The momentum took me through the wall and to the floor.|salign=right|\u2014 Ottman on The Shockmaster's debut<ref name=\"tugboat\"/>}}\n\nDespite generating no crowd reaction, WCW tried to continue with the [[angle (professional wrestling)|angle]], repackaging The Shockmaster character as a [[:wikt:klutz|klutz]] in a series of pre-recorded promos (featuring Ottman in different attire, without a mask and using his own voice). It was this version of the character that went on to appear as planned in the main event of Fall Brawl, teaming with Sting, Dustin Rhodes and Davey Boy Smith in the War Games match. His ring attire for his match was a plain white shirt, jeans and a white construction worker's helmet, very different to the character in its infamous debut. He entered last into the match and actually gained the victory for his team by forcing Kole to submit to a bear hug. This was the last major appearance of the character and it was abandoned soon afterwards.\n\n[[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] later claimed, on an episode of WWE 24/7's \"Legends of Wrestling\" show, the piece of lumber previously wasn't there during a successful practice run and it was later put there by [[David Crockett (wrestling)|David Crockett]] without informing Ottman. WWE, on its official website, wrote, \"There is a case to be made that The Shockmaster's debut at WCW ''Clash of the Champions XXIV'' is the greatest of all time \u2014 albeit for all the wrong reasons.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/20-memorable-debuts/page-16|title=20 memorable Superstar debuts: #6 Shockmaster|work=[[WWE]]|first=Powers|last=Kevin|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref> The organization has also described the incident as \"one of the most unintentionally funny moments in sports entertainment history,\"<ref name=\"tugboat\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wherearetheynow/tugboat|title=Catching up with Tugboat|work=[[WWE]]|first=Brett|last=Hoffman|accessdate=February 16, 2010}}</ref> and \"a debacle many still consider one of the worst gaffes in the history of sports-entertainment.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/nitrofeature|title=Wherever Nitro goes, success follows|work=[[WWE]]|first=Zack|last=Zeigler|accessdate=February 16, 2010}}</ref> While Ottman was initially displeased with the turn of events, he now finds humor in the incident.<ref name=\"tugboat\"/>\n\n====Super Shockmaster (1993&ndash;1994)====\nWCW attempted to salvage the incident by introducing a new character called ''' The Super Shockmaster.''' Also portrayed by Ottman, he was presented as The Shockmaster's nephew, and referred to the Shockmaster as \"Uncle Fred.\" Ottman left the company in January 1994. \n\nIn 2009, [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Triple H]], and Dusty Rhodes appeared on a segment of ''[[WWE Raw]]'' to discuss the DVD release of ''The Rise and Fall of WCW'' when Triple H brought up the subject of the Shockmaster's debut. During that segment, the WWE recreated the Shockmaster's stumbling through the wall, with [[Santino Marella]] portraying the character and [[Arn Anderson]] providing the voice.\n\nOn February 22, 2016, Ottman returned as The Shockmaster for an episode of the [[WWE Network]] show, ''The Edge and Christian Show That Totally Reeks of Awesomeness''. On the show, The Shockmaster was given the opportunity to redeem the famous debut incident by walking through the show's banner.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyddt.com/2016/02/22/edge-christian-show-totally-reeks-awesomeness-review-episode-1/|title=The Edge and Christian Show That Totally Reeks of Awesomeness Review: Episode 1|date=February 22, 2016|work=Daily DDT|access-date=June 10, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Return to the WWF (1994, 2001)===\nOttman returned to the WWF as Typhoon in May 1994, taking the place of his former partner Earthquake in house show matches against [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] after Earthquake left the WWF. Typhoon made his return to television on the June 25 episode of ''Superstars'' (taped May 25), defeating [[Carl Ouellet|Quebecer Pierre]].

In December 1995, he went to Japan to compete in a one-night tag team tournament, held by [[WAR (wrestling promotion)|WAR]]. He teamed up with [[Akio Sato (wrestler)|Shinja]] and advanced to the semi-finals, before losing to [[Genichiro Tenryu]] and [[Ultimo Dragon]]. In March 1996, he wrestled a tour of [[Malaysia]] for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] \n feuding with [[King Kong Bundy]].\n\nBy the late 1990s, he was wrestling primarily in Florida, where he competed for FOW and WXO. In WXO, he was given a [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] where he was too big to get out of his own car. He lost to NWA World Heavyweight Champion [[Dan Severn]] on November 7, 1997 in Gainesville, Florida. On May 27, 2000 as Typhoon he defeated [[One Man Gang]] and [[The Harris Brothers|Ron Harris]] in a 3 way match for Wrestling In Ashwaubenon independent show in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin. In 2001 Ottman retired from wrestling.\n\n==Other media==\nIn 1992, he appeared as Typhoon (along with Earthquake) in the [[SNES]] version of the video game ''[[WWF Super Wrestlemania]]''. The Disasters were absent from the Sega version. On February 23, 2016, he appeared as downloadable content for ''[[WWE 2K16]]''. He appears along with Earthquake in ''[[WWE 2K17]] and [[WWE 2K18]]'' as well. In 2K18, the Shockmaster helmet (slightly modified as to avoid any copyright disputes with the Star Wars license) and the Typhoon singlet are available in the game's attire creation suite, and can be worn by any character in the game.\n\n==Personal life==\nOttman retired from wrestling after WXO folded in 2001. He now lives in [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]], Florida and works as a safety manager for Gaffin Industrial Services, a building cleaning service. He also coaches the [[Little League Baseball|little league]] team of his two sons, Berkley and Beau and daughter, Bailey.<ref name=WWE>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wherearetheynow/tugboat|title=Catching up with Tugboat|publisher=WWE|accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref> He is the brother-in-law of late pro wrestler [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]].<ref name=\"oklafan.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oklafan.com/news/1401/bios/256/profile.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131011232516/http://www.oklafan.com/news/1401/bios/256/profile.html |archivedate=October 11, 2013 }}</ref> He is one of the two uncles of [[Cody Rhodes]] and [[Goldust]], the other being [[Jerry Sags]].<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/c/cody-rhodes.html|title=Cody Rhodes Profile|publisher=Online World Of Wrestling|accessdate=October 18, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n*'''[[Continental Wrestling Association]]'''\n**[[AWA International Heavyweight Championship]] ([[AWA International Heavyweight Championship#Title history|1 time]])\n**[[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship]] ([[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship#Title history|2 times]]) - with [[Jerry Lawler]] (1 time) and Goliath (1 time)<ref name=SouthernTag>{{cite book | first1=Royal |last1=Duncan |first2=Gary |last2=Will | title=Wrestling title histories: professional wrestling champions around the world from the 19th century to the present |location=Waterloo, Ontario |origyear=2000.|chapter= (Memphis, Nashville) Tennessee: Southern Tag Team Title [Roy Welsch & Nick Gulas, Jerry Jarrett from 1977] | pages= 185\u2013189| publisher=Archeus Communications |year=2006 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref><ref name=SouthernTagWeb>{{cite web | url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/tn/cwa/awa-s-t.html | title=Southern Tag Team Title | work=Wrestling-Titles | accessdate=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''[[Championship Wrestling from Florida]]'''\n**[[NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship]] ([[NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship#title history|1 time]])\n*'''International Wrestling Association'''\n**IWA United States Heavyweight Championship (1 time)<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n*'''[[Super World of Sports]]'''\n**SWS Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]]\n*'''Universal Superstars of America'''\n**USA Heavyweight Championship (1 time)<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2000|edition=4th|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref>\n*'''[[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]'''\n**[[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] ([[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|1 time]]) - with Earthquake\n* '''''[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'''''\n** [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Worst Gimmick|Worst Gimmick]] (1993) <small>(as The Shockmaster)</small><ref name=WONAwards>{{cite journal|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|date=January 26, 2011|title=Biggest issue of the year: The 2011 Wrestling Observer Newsletter Awards Issue|periodical=[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]|location=Campbell, CA|pages=1\u201340|issn=1083-9593}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[The Natural Disasters]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{WWE superstar|tugboat|Tugboat}}\n* {{Professional wrestling profiles}}\n* {{IMDb name|name=Fred Ottman}}\n\n{{World Tag Team Championship (WWE)}}\n{{Rhodes family}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ottman, Fred}}\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:American male professional wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Masked wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestlers from Virginia]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Norfolk, Virginia]]\n", "name_user": "Fylindfotberserk", "label": "safe", "comment": "Generalformattingbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ottman"}

During the [[Battle of Schliengen]], in which the [[French Revolution]]ary army fought the forces of [[Austria]], the battle lines of both armies ended in Kandern. It is not far from a [[tripoint]] called the \"[[Regio TriRhena|Three-Country Corner]]\" ([[:de:Dreil\u00e4ndereck|Dreil\u00e4ndereck]]), where the three countries [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] meet.\n\n[[File:Sutter Birthplace.jpg|thumb|130px|left|The birthplace of [[John Sutter]] in Kandern]]\n\nTo many in North America, Kandern is best known as the birthplace of [[John Sutter]], who owned the land that [[gold]] was discovered in 1848, which sparked the [[California gold rush]], and the beginning of intensive settlement in [[California]].\n\nToday, Kandern has a large community of [[English Language|English]]-speaking residents as a result of the presence of [[Black Forest Academy]]. This is an English-language institution founded in 1956. Most of the students are children of international business professionals from around the world, mainly from the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[South Korea]].\n\nThe [[coat of arms]] of Kandern is a pitcher on a yellow background. The [[blazon]] is ''Or a covered Jug Gules''.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:KandernBahnhof.jpg|thumb|right|Museum at Kandern railway station]]\nKandern lies in southwestern Germany, at the foot of the [[Black Forest]].  North of Kandern is the [[Blauen (Badenweiler)|Blauen]] or Hochblauen, one of the highest mountains in the [[Southern Black Forest]]. The Hochblauen lies at the end of the Kander Valley and is the source of the Kander. Through Kandern runs the well-known [[Westweg]], a hiking trail through the Black Forest from [[Pforzheim]] to [[Basel]]. Nearby is the Sausenberg and its [[Sausenburg Castle|castle]].\n\n=== Neighboring Communities ===\n\n{| width =\"60%\" border = 0 align=\"center\"\n|-----\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Schliengen]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[M\u00fcllheim]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Malsburg-Marzell]]\n|-----\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Bad Bellingen]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[File:Windrose.png|100px]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Steinen (Baden)|Steinen - Endenburg]]\n|-----\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Efringen-Kirchen]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Wittlingen]], [[R\u00fcmmingen]], [[L\u00f6rrach]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Steinen (Baden)|Steinen]]\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Subdivisions (''Ortsteile'') ===\nThe borough of Kandern consists of the town of Kandern itself, and the following villages:\n{|\n|-\n| width=\"250\" valign=\"top\" |\n* [[Kandern-Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]\n* Holzen\n* Riedlingen\n* Sitzenkirch\n* Tannenkirch\n** Uttnach\n** Ettingen\n** Gupf\n| width=\"250\" valign=\"top\" |\n* [[Kandern-Wollbach|Wollbach]]\n** Egerten\n** Egisholz\n** Hammerstein\n** Nebenau\n|}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Schlacht bei Kandern 1848.jpg|thumb|right|Death of General [[Friedrich Freiherr von Gagern|Friedrich von Gagern]] in battle near Kandern in 1848]]\n\nArchaeological finds show that the area that is today Kandern was already inhabited in prehistoric times, by the [[Celts]], and during the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period.  It was probably the local clay deposits that made the site attractive to the early settlers.  The name ''Kandern'' is of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin, meaning ''on the Kander''. [[Kander (Germany)|Kander]] is the name of the stream that flows through the town.  Its name comes from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] ''kandera'' for ''clear flowing''.\n\nKandern is first mentioned in a document from the [[Abbey]] of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin]] in [[Tours]], [[France]].  The document states that one Gundoson bought iron ''in loco municipalitum Chantra super fluvium Hantra'' (\"in the area of the town of Kandern on the river Kander\").<ref>''Kandern ist \u00e4lter als angenommen.'' ''Die Oberbadische'' 28 May 2009: L\u00f6rrach 10</ref>  The next record of Kandern was in 776 A.D. when [[Lorsch Abbey]] obtained the title to some land near Kandern. The annals of the abbey from the same period mention deliveries of iron from Kandern, showing that by the 8th century it was already a recognized location. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], iron working provided Kandern with a certain amount of prosperity and freedom.\n\nThe town of Kandern originally grew out of three localities:\n* Kandern, in the area of the present-day Lutheran church,\n* Minder-Kandern, near the present-day swimming pool, and\n* a settlement on the flat valley bottom near the paper mill\n\nSeveral monasteries owned land in the area, and therefore exercised an influence on Kandern's early history.  The most important of these was the [[Abbey of St. Gall]]en in modern [[Switzerland]].  St. Gallen was a powerful [[List of Imperial abbeys|Imperial abbey]], and acquired considerable territory around Kandern in the early Middle Ages. As a result of defeat in the [[Investiture Controversy]], St. Gallen had to transfer its interests in the area to other monasteries, including St. Alban's in [[Basel]].\n\nKandern was the main town of the domains of [[Sausenburg]], which became part of the possessions of the [[Margrave of Baden]] in 1503.\n\nIn 1810, Kandern was granted the right to become a city, the ''[[German town law|Stadtrecht]]'', which included among other rights the right to be called a city, and to hold a weekly market.  Kandern lost the Stadtrecht due to municipal restructuring during the [[Third Reich]].\n\nIn 1848, during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Badische Revolution]], a battle between revolutionaries under [[Friedrich Hecker]] and Hessian troops under [[Friedrich von Gagern]] occurred on the ''Scheidegg'' near Kandern.  Gagern was killed in the encounter, but the revolutionaries were defeated and scattered.\n\nUntil 1972 Kandern was part of [[Landkreis]] (rural district) [[M\u00fcllheim]].  On the dissolution of Landkreis M\u00fcllheim, Kandern became part of [[Landkreis L\u00f6rrach]].\n\nIn 1974, the surrounding villages of Feuerbach, Holzen, Riedlingen, Sitzenkirch, Tannenkirch, and Wollbach joined the town of Kandern, which then had the necessary population to reclaim the Stadtrecht.  Kandern and the neighboring villages are now collectively referred to as the City of Kandern.\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs in all of the [[Baden|Margraviate of Baden]], Kandern took part in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 1556, and has remained predominately [[Protestant]] since.\n\n=== Villages ===\n\n==== Feuerbach ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Feuerbach.png|45px]]\n\nThe first documented mention of Feuerbach was is the ''[[Liber decimationis]]'' of the [[Bishopric of Konstanz]].  The village became part of the possessions of the [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)|Order of St. John]] in 1297 and eventually came to be owned by the [[Sausenburg Castle|Margrave of Hachberg]] in 1470.  In 1503 Feuerbach, like the rest of the [[Markgr\u00e4flerland]], became part of [[Baden]]. Feuerbach is a recognized [[wine]]-producing municipality with around 12 [[hectare]]s of [[vineyard]]s.  The modern church was built in 1846 on medieval foundations.  Feuerbach's community building houses the village offices, a youth center, the fire department and a community hall for the use of local clubs and individuals.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#feuerbach Feuerbach at kandern.de]</ref>\n\nThe shield of Feurbach does not follow any of the themes used by the other Kandern municipalities. It is not a canting coat of arms, nor does it explicitly relate to the industrial tendencies of the citizens. It was in use long before the administrative merger with Kandern and had been officially registered in 1961.<ref name=boven>[[David Boven|Boven, David]]. \"[http://www.bovenet.com/app/download/2936929813/The+Heraldic+Heritage+of+a+Small+Black+Forest+Community.pdf The Heraldic Heritage of a Small Black Forest Community].\" ''Heraldry in Canada'' '''42''', 1-4 (December 2008): 11-18.</ref>\n\n==== Holzen ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Holzen.png|45px]]\n\nThe first documented reference to Holzen was in the year 1249.  In recent times, Holzen has become well known for its large [[stork]] population.  A stork refuge was built in Holzen in 1979 in hopes of re-establishing the large birds in the area, where they used to be common in medieval and early modern times.  The storks have spread over a wide area, and are particularly noticeable in their nests on church steeples throughout the Markgr\u00e4flerland.\nIn addition to the village offices, the Holzen ''Rathaus'' ([[town hall]]) houses the Kandern [[Land Registration]] office and the local youth center.  New developments around Holzen complement the traditionally built ''Altdorf''.\nWine production is an important part of the local agriculture, with 1473 [[Hectare#Are|are]]s of vineyards in the area around the village.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#holzen Holzen at kandern.de]</ref>\n\n==== Riedlingen ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Riedlingen.png|45px]]\n\nThe documentary evidence for the village of Riedlingen dates as far back as 972.  This village in the valley of the Feuerbach [[stream|creek]] was already settled by the early [[Alamanni]] tribes in Roman times, as excavation of burials in the area has shown.  Here one finds a very traditional village center with a church and old farmhouses.  New development has surrounded the old village, particularly on the slopes of the Schorner, a forested hill to the north.  Riedlingen is the site of one of Kandern's industrial areas, as well as the Kandern [[golf]] course.  For two weeks each summer (and occasionally in winter) the \"Theater im Hof\" offers modern plays in a romantic interior courtyard converted to an open-air theater.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#riedlingen Riedlingen at kandern.de]</ref>\n\n==== Sitzenkirch ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Sitzenkirch.png|45px]]\n\nThe first documented mention of Sitzenkirch was in 1120, when the village belonged to the [[St. Blasien Abbey in the Black Forest|Abbey of St. Blasien]].\nNotable sights in the village include a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church built in 1290 and an [[Water wheel|overshot millwheel]].  Until the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] there was a small [[convent]] for nuns near the church.  The village was destroyed during the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, with only the church surviving.  The church and convent remained in the possession of St. Blasien until 1805.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#sitzenkirch Sitzenkirch at kandern.de]</ref>\n\n==== Tannenkirch ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Tannenkirch.png|45px]]\n\nTannenkirch was first documented in 1179.  The village of Tannenkirch itself is composed of four smaller villages; Tannenkirch, Ettingen, Uttnach, and Gupf, the former three of which have grown together and are now coterminous.  Due to Tannenkirch's location with good southern exposure, low precipitation, and an almost [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] [[microclimate]] it is an ideal location for [[viniculture]].  An interpretive trail through the vineyards informs visitors about the traditions of [[wine]] growing.\nIn clear weather Tannenkirch has a good view of the [[Alsace]], the [[Black Forest]], the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]] and the peaks of the [[Bernese Alps]].\nThe village church contains medieval [[fresco]]es, and a family of [[stork]]s in the nest on the steeple.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the [[Margrave]] held court on the nearby Sausenhard.  Kaltenherberge, today a riding stable, was originally a post station on the route from [[Basel]] to [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]].\nTannenkirch has its own [[kindergarten]] and grade school.  The main commercial activity is agriculture and vineyards (around 2262 [[Hectare#Are|are]] - 22.62 [[hectare]]s), as well as local [[tradesman|tradesmen]] and an [[Agricultural machinery|implement]] dealership.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#tannenkirch Tannenkirch at kandern.de]</ref>\nSee also [[:de:Kandern-Tannenkirch|Tannenkirch]] in the German Wikipedia.\n\n==== Wollbach ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Wollbach.png|45px]]\n\nWollbach was first documented in 767.  Wollbach is the largest \"suburb\" of Kandern by population, and is composed of the villages of Wollbach, Egerten, Egisholz, Hammerstein, and Nebenau.  There are three historical mills in Wollbach; the Hofm\u00fchle - still in operation today, the Hammersteiner M\u00fchle - today a private house, and the Bruckm\u00fchle - currently a restaurant.  In the surrounding forest there are remains of [[iron ore|iron mines]].  Public facilities in Wollbach include a kindergarten, grade school, and sports hall.  There are two museums in Wollbach, one of the [[Painting|painter]] [[Max B\u00f6hlen]] in his former house (today a restaurant), and a historical [[Lime kiln]] in Nebenau.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#wollbach Wollbach at kandern.de]</ref>\nSee also [[:de:Kandern-Wollbach|Wollbach]] in the German Wikipedia.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Mayor ===\n<!-- please include other mayors with dates and party -->\n*since 1996: Bernhard Winterhalter [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]\n\n=== Town council ===\nThe town council currently consists of 20 members, besides the mayor.

The [[blazon]] is ''Or a covered Jug Gules''. The jug, or ''kanne'', alludes to the town's name, and was first used on border stones as a village sign in the 18th century. There are no old seals known from the village. The oldest seals date from the early 19th century and show the shield bearing the jug. Since that time, all seals and images of the arms have shown this symbol, though its size and shape have changed considerably.\n\n=== Twin towns ===\n* [[Soufflenheim]] in [[Alsace]] since 1985.\n\n== Culture and places of interest ==\n<!--=== Theatres ===-->\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeimat- und Keramikmuseum Kandern (Homeland and Ceramic Museum)\n:The museum was opened in 1776 in a [[Crow-stepped gable|stepped gable]] house from the 16th century.

The second floor is dedicated to artistic pottery, including work from [[Max Laeuger]], one of the pioneers of modern German pottery, pieces from the [[faience|Fayence]]-Manufaktur Kandern (1927\u20131938), Richard Bampi, Horst Kerstan, and current artists.\n:Historical artifacts include a copy of the \"''Goldenen Sau von Kandern''\" (Golden Sow of Kandern), a drinking pitcher in the shape of a [[wild boar]] commissioned by the [[Margrave]] in 1605 to commemorate a successful hunt in the Kandern area.  The original is in the Badischen Landesmuseum in [[Karlsruhe]].<ref>[http://www.badische-seiten.de/kandern/goldene-sau.php Badische-seiten.de]</ref> In addition, the museum has items from the Battle of Kandern, an important battle in the [[Badische Revolution]] of 1848.\n\nMax B\u00f6hlen Museum [http://www.max-boehlen-museum.de]\n:The [[Bern]]ese painter, Max B\u00f6hlen (1902\u20131971), lived and worked from 1939 in Kandern-Egerten.

It is not far from a [[tripoint]] called the \"[[Regio TriRhena|Three-Country Corner]]\" ([[:de:Dreil\u00e4ndereck|Dreil\u00e4ndereck]]), where the three countries [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] meet.\n\n[[File:Sutter Birthplace.jpg|thumb|130px|left|The birthplace of [[John Sutter]] in Kandern]]\n\nTo many in North America, Kandern is best known as the birthplace of [[John Sutter]], who owned the land that [[gold]] was discovered in 1848, which sparked the [[California gold rush]], and the beginning of intensive settlement in [[California]].\n\nToday, Kandern has a large community of [[English Language|English]]-speaking residents as a result of the presence of [[Black Forest Academy]]. This is an English-language institution founded in 1956. Most of the students are children of international business professionals from around the world, mainly from the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[South Korea]].\n\nThe [[coat of arms]] of Kandern is a pitcher on a yellow background. The [[blazon]] is ''Or a covered Jug Gules''.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:KandernBahnhof.jpg|thumb|right|Museum at Kandern railway station]]\nKandern lies in southwestern Germany, at the foot of the [[Black Forest]].  North of Kandern is the [[Blauen (Badenweiler)|Blauen]] or Hochblauen, one of the highest mountains in the [[Southern Black Forest]]. The Hochblauen lies at the end of the Kander Valley and is the source of the Kander. Through Kandern runs the well-known [[Westweg]], a hiking trail through the Black Forest from [[Pforzheim]] to [[Basel]]. Nearby is the Sausenberg and its [[Sausenburg Castle|castle]].\n\n=== Neighboring Communities ===\n\n{| width =\"60%\" border = 0 align=\"center\"\n|-----\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Schliengen]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[M\u00fcllheim]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Malsburg-Marzell]]\n|-----\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Bad Bellingen]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[File:Windrose.png|100px]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Steinen (Baden)|Steinen - Endenburg]]\n|-----\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Efringen-Kirchen]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Wittlingen]], [[R\u00fcmmingen]], [[L\u00f6rrach]]\n| width =\"33%\" align=\"center\" | [[Steinen (Baden)|Steinen]]\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Subdivisions (''Ortsteile'') ===\nThe borough of Kandern consists of the town of Kandern itself, and the following villages:\n{|\n|-\n| width=\"250\" valign=\"top\" |\n* [[Kandern-Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]\n* Holzen\n* Riedlingen\n* Sitzenkirch\n* Tannenkirch\n** Uttnach\n** Ettingen\n** Gupf\n| width=\"250\" valign=\"top\" |\n* [[Kandern-Wollbach|Wollbach]]\n** Egerten\n** Egisholz\n** Hammerstein\n** Nebenau\n|}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Schlacht bei Kandern 1848.jpg|thumb|right|Death of General [[Friedrich Freiherr von Gagern|Friedrich von Gagern]] in battle near Kandern in 1848]]\n\nArchaeological finds show that the area that is today Kandern was already inhabited in prehistoric times, by the [[Celts]], and during the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period.  It was probably the local clay deposits that made the site attractive to the early settlers.  The name ''Kandern'' is of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin, meaning ''on the Kander''. [[Kander (Germany)|Kander]] is the name of the stream that flows through the town.  Its name comes from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] ''kandera'' for ''clear flowing''.\n\nKandern is first mentioned in a document from the [[Abbey]] of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin]] in [[Tours]], [[France]].  The document states that one Gundoson bought iron ''in loco municipalitum Chantra super fluvium Hantra'' (\"in the area of the town of Kandern on the river Kander\").<ref>''Kandern ist \u00e4lter als angenommen.'' ''Die Oberbadische'' 28 May 2009: L\u00f6rrach 10</ref>  The next record of Kandern was in 776 A.D. when [[Lorsch Abbey]] obtained the title to some land near Kandern. The annals of the abbey from the same period mention deliveries of iron from Kandern, showing that by the 8th century it was already a recognized location. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], iron working provided Kandern with a certain amount of prosperity and freedom.\n\nThe town of Kandern originally grew out of three localities:\n* Kandern, in the area of the present-day Lutheran church,\n* Minder-Kandern, near the present-day swimming pool, and\n* a settlement on the flat valley bottom near the paper mill\n\nSeveral monasteries owned land in the area, and therefore exercised an influence on Kandern's early history.  The most important of these was the [[Abbey of St. Gall]]en in modern [[Switzerland]].  St. Gallen was a powerful [[List of Imperial abbeys|Imperial abbey]], and acquired considerable territory around Kandern in the early Middle Ages. As a result of defeat in the [[Investiture Controversy]], St. Gallen had to transfer its interests in the area to other monasteries, including St. Alban's in [[Basel]].\n\nKandern was the main town of the domains of [[Sausenburg]], which became part of the possessions of the [[Margrave of Baden]] in 1503.\n\nIn 1810, Kandern was granted the right to become a city, the ''[[German town law|Stadtrecht]]'', which included among other rights the right to be called a city, and to hold a weekly market.  Kandern lost the Stadtrecht due to municipal restructuring during the [[Third Reich]].\n\nIn 1848, during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Badische Revolution]], a battle between revolutionaries under [[Friedrich Hecker]] and Hessian troops under [[Friedrich von Gagern]] occurred on the ''Scheidegg'' near Kandern.  Gagern was killed in the encounter, but the revolutionaries were defeated and scattered.\n\nUntil 1972 Kandern was part of [[Landkreis]] (rural district) [[M\u00fcllheim]].  On the dissolution of Landkreis M\u00fcllheim, Kandern became part of [[Landkreis L\u00f6rrach]].\n\nIn 1974, the surrounding villages of Feuerbach, Holzen, Riedlingen, Sitzenkirch, Tannenkirch, and Wollbach joined the town of Kandern, which then had the necessary population to reclaim the Stadtrecht.  Kandern and the neighboring villages are now collectively referred to as the City of Kandern.\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs in all of the [[Baden|Margravite of Baden]], Kandern took part in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 1556, and has remained predominately [[Protestant]] since.\n\n=== Villages ===\n\n==== Feuerbach ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Feuerbach.png|45px]]\n\nThe first documented mention of Feuerbach was is the ''[[Liber decimationis]]'' of the [[Bishopric of Konstanz]].  The village became part of the possessions of the [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)|Order of St. John]] in 1297 and eventually came to be owned by the [[Sausenburg Castle|Margrave of Hachberg]] in 1470.  In 1503 Feuerbach, like the rest of the [[Markgr\u00e4flerland]], became part of [[Baden]]. Feuerbach is a recognized [[wine]]-producing municipality with around 12 [[hectare]]s of [[vineyard]]s.  The modern church was built in 1846 on medieval foundations.  Feuerbach's community building houses the village offices, a youth center, the fire department and a community hall for the use of local clubs and individuals.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#feuerbach Feuerbach at kandern.de]</ref>\n\nThe shield of Feurbach does not follow any of the themes used by the other Kandern municipalities. It is not a canting coat of arms, nor does it explicitly relate to the industrial tendencies of the citizens. It was in use long before the administrative merger with Kandern and had been officially registered in 1961.<ref name=boven>[[David Boven|Boven, David]]. \"[http://www.bovenet.com/app/download/2936929813/The+Heraldic+Heritage+of+a+Small+Black+Forest+Community.pdf The Heraldic Heritage of a Small Black Forest Community].\" ''Heraldry in Canada'' '''42''', 1-4 (December 2008): 11-18.</ref>\n\n==== Holzen ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Holzen.png|45px]]\n\nThe first documented reference to Holzen was in the year 1249.  In recent times, Holzen has become well known for its large [[stork]] population.  A stork refuge was built in Holzen in 1979 in hopes of re-establishing the large birds in the area, where they used to be common in medieval and early modern times.  The storks have spread over a wide area, and are particularly noticeable in their nests on church steeples throughout the Markgr\u00e4flerland.\nIn addition to the village offices, the Holzen ''Rathaus'' ([[town hall]]) houses the Kandern [[Land Registration]] office and the local youth center.  New developments around Holzen complement the traditionally built ''Altdorf''.\nWine production is an important part of the local agriculture, with 1473 [[Hectare#Are|are]]s of vineyards in the area around the village.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#holzen Holzen at kandern.de]</ref>\n\n==== Riedlingen ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Riedlingen.png|45px]]\n\nThe documentary evidence for the village of Riedlingen dates as far back as 972.  This village in the valley of the Feuerbach [[stream|creek]] was already settled by the early [[Alamanni]] tribes in Roman times, as excavation of burials in the area has shown.  Here one finds a very traditional village center with a church and old farmhouses.  New development has surrounded the old village, particularly on the slopes of the Schorner, a forested hill to the north.  Riedlingen is the site of one of Kandern's industrial areas, as well as the Kandern [[golf]] course.  For two weeks each summer (and occasionally in winter) the \"Theater im Hof\" offers modern plays in a romantic interior courtyard converted to an open-air theater.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#riedlingen Riedlingen at kandern.de]</ref>\n\n==== Sitzenkirch ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Sitzenkirch.png|45px]]\n\nThe first documented mention of Sitzenkirch was in 1120, when the village belonged to the [[St. Blasien Abbey in the Black Forest|Abbey of St. Blasien]].\nNotable sights in the village include a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church built in 1290 and an [[Water wheel|overshot millwheel]].  Until the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] there was a small [[convent]] for nuns near the church.  The village was destroyed during the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, with only the church surviving.  The church and convent remained in the possession of St. Blasien until 1805.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#sitzenkirch Sitzenkirch at kandern.de]</ref>\n\n==== Tannenkirch ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Tannenkirch.png|45px]]\n\nTannenkirch was first documented in 1179.  The village of Tannenkirch itself is composed of four smaller villages; Tannenkirch, Ettingen, Uttnach, and Gupf, the former three of which have grown together and are now coterminous.  Due to Tannenkirch's location with good southern exposure, low precipitation, and an almost [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] [[microclimate]] it is an ideal location for [[viniculture]].  An interpretive trail through the vineyards informs visitors about the traditions of [[wine]] growing.\nIn clear weather Tannenkirch has a good view of the [[Alsace]], the [[Black Forest]], the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]] and the peaks of the [[Bernese Alps]].\nThe village church contains medieval [[fresco]]es, and a family of [[stork]]s in the nest on the steeple.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the [[Margrave]] held court on the nearby Sausenhard.  Kaltenherberge, today a riding stable, was originally a post station on the route from [[Basel]] to [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]].\nTannenkirch has its own [[kindergarten]] and grade school.  The main commercial activity is agriculture and vineyards (around 2262 [[Hectare#Are|are]] - 22.62 [[hectare]]s), as well as local [[tradesman|tradesmen]] and an [[Agricultural machinery|implement]] dealership.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#tannenkirch Tannenkirch at kandern.de]</ref>\nSee also [[:de:Kandern-Tannenkirch|Tannenkirch]] in the German Wikipedia.\n\n==== Wollbach ====\n[[File:Wappen Kandern-Wollbach.png|45px]]\n\nWollbach was first documented in 767.  Wollbach is the largest \"suburb\" of Kandern by population, and is composed of the villages of Wollbach, Egerten, Egisholz, Hammerstein, and Nebenau.  There are three historical mills in Wollbach; the Hofm\u00fchle - still in operation today, the Hammersteiner M\u00fchle - today a private house, and the Bruckm\u00fchle - currently a restaurant.  In the surrounding forest there are remains of [[iron ore|iron mines]].  Public facilities in Wollbach include a kindergarten, grade school, and sports hall.  There are two museums in Wollbach, one of the [[Painting|painter]] [[Max B\u00f6hlen]] in his former house (today a restaurant), and a historical [[Lime kiln]] in Nebenau.<ref>[http://www.kandern.de/pmws/indexDOM.php?client_id=kandern&page_id=kernstadt&lang_iso639=de#wollbach Wollbach at kandern.de]</ref>\nSee also [[:de:Kandern-Wollbach|Wollbach]] in the German Wikipedia.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Mayor ===\n<!-- please include other mayors with dates and party -->\n*since 1996: Bernhard Winterhalter [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]\n\n=== Town council ===\nThe town council currently consists of 20 members, besides the mayor.

The [[blazon]] is ''Or a covered Jug Gules''. The jug, or ''kanne'', alludes to the town's name, and was first used on border stones as a village sign in the 18th century. There are no old seals known from the village. The oldest seals date from the early 19th century and show the shield bearing the jug. Since that time, all seals and images of the arms have shown this symbol, though its size and shape have changed considerably.\n\n=== Twin towns ===\n* [[Soufflenheim]] in [[Alsace]] since 1985.\n\n== Culture and places of interest ==\n<!--=== Theatres ===-->\n\n=== Museums ===\nHeimat- und Keramikmuseum Kandern (Homeland and Ceramic Museum)\n:The museum was opened in 1776 in a [[Crow-stepped gable|stepped gable]] house from the 16th century.  In addition to many documents and items from Kandern's history, the museum  has a large collection of local pottery from the medieval times to the present.\n:The first floor contains a wide variety of utilitarian pottery made in Kandern through the ages.  The second floor is dedicated to artistic pottery, including work from [[Max Laeuger]], one of the pioneers of modern German pottery, pieces from the [[faience|Fayence]]-Manufaktur Kandern (1927\u20131938), Richard Bampi, Horst Kerstan, and current artists.\n:Historical artifacts include a copy of the \"''Goldenen Sau von Kandern''\" (Golden Sow of Kandern), a drinking pitcher in the shape of a [[wild boar]] commissioned by the [[Margrave]] in 1605 to commemorate a successful hunt in the Kandern area.  The original is in the Badischen Landesmuseum in [[Karlsruhe]].<ref>[http://www.badische-seiten.de/kandern/goldene-sau.php Badische-seiten.de]</ref> In addition, the museum has items from the Battle of Kandern, an important battle in the [[Badische Revolution]] of 1848.\n\nMax B\u00f6hlen Museum [http://www.max-boehlen-museum.de]\n:The [[Bern]]ese painter, Max B\u00f6hlen (1902\u20131971), lived and worked from 1939 in Kandern-Egerten.

Prospero awakens with a start as lightning strikes the ship, and summons his servant, the spirit Ariel. Ariel tells Prospero the details of the storm, which was an illusion he created at Prospero's command to lead the King of Naples (Alonso) and his crew to the island and trap them there.\n\nProspero's daughter, Miranda, wakes up and joins her father in his study and they discuss their pasts. Caliban, Prospero's other servant, interrupts their conversation, and Prospero stomps on his fingers and threatens to punish him. Caliban explains that he is the rightful owner of the island, and that Prospero enslaved him after he taught Prospero how to survive on the island.\n\nMiranda goes back to sleep, and Ariel announces that the ship is safely hidden. He tells Prospero that the King and his son, Ferdinand, have been separated by the wreck. Prospero instructs Ariel to bring Ferdinand into the house. Ariel goes to Ferdinand, who has emerged naked from the sea, and lures him towards the house with a song. Ferdinand enters the building and goes to sleep by the fireplace. Prospero, Ariel, and Miranda find him sleeping and Prospero promises Ariel his freedom in two days\u2019 time for bringing him to the house. Prospero accuses Ferdinand of being a spy, and Miranda vouches for his innocence. Prospero gives Ferdinand clothing and permission to sleep in Caliban's quarters, promising to put him to work after he has rested, and shackles his ankles.\n\nMiranda asks Prospero about their past, and he reveals that he was once Duke of Milan, but turned his governing duties over to Antonio so that he could study magic. He explains that Antonio overthrew Prospero and, with an order from Alonso, Prospero and Miranda were exiled to the island. Prospero shows Miranda a vision of their past in the crystal of his scepter, and reveals that the storm was created so that he could exact revenge upon Alonso and Antonio.\n\nMeanwhile, Alonso and the other shipwreck survivors find and enter Prospero's house. Following the sound of music, they wander into an empty ballroom. They are attacked by imps who hiss and bite at them. Ariel appears and reminds them of how they wronged Prospero in the past, and they become frozen in stasis and covered in cobwebs.\n\nProspero sees Miranda and Ferdinand share a kiss, as the two have decided to marry, and announces that Ferdinand's forced labor was a trial to prove himself worthy of marrying Miranda. Prospero permits their union and frees Ferdinand from Servitude.\n\nProspero and Ariel use their magic to create an elaborate [[masque]] around the frozen Alonso and the others. Sailors dance around the room frantically, and Miranda and Ferdinand appear in wedding attire. Prospero awakens Alonso and the others from stasis, reuniting Ferdinand with his father, and forgives the others for their past betrayals. The Goddess appears and sings a rendition of \u201c[[Stormy Weather (song)|Stormy Weather]]\u201d while everyone looks on.\n\nThe film ends with Prospero and Ariel alone in the study. Ariel sings Prospero to sleep, and then runs away. Prospero directly addresses the viewer through voice over narration, announcing that \u201cthese revels now have ended\u201d, and the credits roll.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Peter Bull]] as Alonso (King of Naples)\n* [[David Meyer]] as Ferdinand\n* Neil Cunningham as Sebastian\n* [[Heathcote Williams]] as Prospero\n* [[Toyah Willcox]] as Miranda\n* [[Richard Warwick]] as Antonio\n* [[Karl Johnson (actor)|Karl Johnson]] as Ariel\n* [[Jack Birkett]] as Caliban\n* [[Christopher Biggins]] as Stephano\n* Peter Turner as Trinculo\n* [[Ken Campbell]] as Gonzalo\n* [[Elisabeth Welch]] as A Goddess\nThe film features cameos by [[Claire Davenport]] as Sycorax, Kate Temple as Young Miranda, and [[Helen Wellington-Lloyd]] and Angela Wittingham as The Spirits.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nJarman had been working on adapting ''The Tempest'' for several years before filming began, working on an adaptation for the stage before settling on a film adaptation.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> He was attracted to Shakespeare's original play due to the themes of forgiveness he saw throughout the text.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> He was concerned with creating a film that struck a balance between aspects of theater and aspects of film, and reworked the text so that his version would not be a straightforward adaptation of the play.<ref name=\":3\" /> Jarman stated in his production notes that \"I hope to capture something of the mystery and atmosphere of the original without descending to theatrics.

Prospero awakens with a start as lightning strikes the ship, and summons his servant, the spirit Ariel. Ariel tells Prospero the details of the storm, which was an illusion he created at Prospero\u2019s command to lead the King of Naples (Alonso) and his crew to the island and trap them there.\n\nProspero\u2019s daughter, Miranda, wakes up and joins her father in his study and they discuss their pasts. Caliban, Prospero\u2019s other servant, interrupts their conversation, and Prospero stomps on his fingers and threatens to punish him. Caliban explains that he is the rightful owner of the island, and that Prospero enslaved him after he taught Prospero how to survive on the island.\n\nMiranda goes back to sleep, and Ariel announces that the ship is safely hidden.

While broadly categorized as a western, or an [[epic film|epic]], the film encompasses several literary/film genres, including [[comedy film|comedy]], [[drama film|drama]] and [[adventure film|adventure]]. It is about a white male child raised by the [[Cheyenne]] nation during the 19th century. The film is largely concerned with contrasting the lives of [[Settler|American pioneers]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] throughout the progression of the boy's life.  It stars [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Chief Dan George]], [[Faye Dunaway]], [[Martin Balsam]], [[Jeff Corey]] and [[Richard Mulligan]].\n\nIt is a [[revisionist Western]]: Native Americans are depicted sympathetically, and the [[United States Cavalry]] are depicted as villains.  The revision uses elements of [[satire]] and [[tragedy]] to examine [[prejudice]] and injustice. ''Little Big Man'' is an [[New Hollywood|anti-establishment film]] of the period, indirectly protesting America's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] by portraying the [[United States Armed Forces]] negatively.<ref name=HollywoodsIndian/>\n\nIn 2014, ''Little Big Man'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"loc.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-14-210/new-films-added-to-national-registry/2014-12-17/|title=Cinematic Treasures Named to National Film Registry|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1970, 121&nbsp;year-old Jack Crabb, the oldest man in the world, is residing in a hospice and recounts his life story to a curious historian. Among other things, Crabb claims to have been a captive of the [[Cheyenne]], a [[gunslinger]], an associate of [[Wild Bill Hickok]], a scout for General [[George Armstrong Custer]], and the sole white survivor of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]].<ref name=HollywoodsIndian>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvLJQsO3O0oC&pg=PP2&dq=%22Little+Big+Man%22+film#v=onepage&q=%22Little%20Big%20Man%22%20film&f=false|title=Hollywood's Indian: The Portrayal of the Native American in Film|date=2011 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky|pages=121\u2013136|last1=Rollins|first1=Peter|isbn=978-0813131658}}</ref>\n\n===Childhood===\nJack begins his story in a flashback to 1859, when he was 10&nbsp;years old. He and his older sister Caroline survived the massacre of their pioneer parents by the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] and are discovered by Shadow, a [[Cheyenne]] brave, who takes the siblings to his village. Caroline escapes, but Jack remains and is reared by the good-hearted tribal leader, Old Lodge Skins.<ref name=HollywoodsIndian/>\n\nAs Jack gets older, he unwittingly makes an enemy of another boy, Younger Bear; however, Younger Bear eventually owes his life to Jack when he saves Younger Bear's life from a Pawnee brave. Jack is given the name \"Little Big Man\" because he is short but very brave.\n\nIn 1865, when Jack is 16, he is captured by U.S.&nbsp;Cavalry troopers during a skirmish and renounces his Cheyenne upbringing in order to save himself from being killed. After spending time in U.S. Army custody and going through interrogations and debriefing, Jack, being a minor, is put in the foster care of Reverend Silas Pendrake and his sexually frustrated wife, Louise, who tries to seduce Jack. When he witnesses Mrs.&nbsp;Pendrake having sex with the soda shop owner, Jack leaves the Pendrake household and renounces his foster parents and religion.\n\n===Gunslinger===\nIn 1866, Jack becomes the apprentice of the [[snake-oil]] salesman Meriweather. The two are [[tarred and feathered]] when their customers realize that Meriweather's products are fraudulent. One of the angry customers is Jack's now-grown sister, Caroline, with whom he reunites. She attempts to mold her brother into a gunslinger named \"the Soda Pop Kid\". Jack meets [[Wild Bill Hickok]] at a saloon, and Hickok takes a liking to the young man. When Hickok is forced to kill a man in self-defense, Jack loses his taste for gunslinging and Caroline deserts him.\n\nA year or so later, Jack becomes a partner in a [[general store]] and marries a Swedish woman named Olga. Jack's business partner turns out to be a thieving scoundrel. The famous cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer suggests the couple restart their lives further west and assures them they have nothing to fear from Indians.\n\nJack and Olga set out, but their [[stagecoach]] is ambushed by Cheyenne warriors. Olga is abducted and Jack sets out in search of her. He is reunited with Old Lodge Skins and Younger Bear. Younger Bear has become a [[Contrary (social role)|Contrary]] \u2013 a warrior who does everything in reverse. Jack makes friends with the [[two-spirit|Heemaneh]] Little Horse, but continues on his search for Olga.\n\n===First round with Custer===\nA few months later, Jack eventually becomes a \"[[Arriero|muleskinner]]\" in Custer's [[7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]], only because Custer incorrectly determines that was Jack's past job. He takes part in a battle against the Cheyenne, but when the troopers begin killing women and children, Jack turns on them.\n\nOn the outskirts of the massacre, Jack is attacked by Shadow, the Cheyenne warrior who saved him as a child but now does not recognize him. Shadow is killed by a cavalryman, and Jack discovers Shadow's daughter, Sunshine, giving birth while hiding from the onslaught. He returns with her to Old Lodge Skins's tribe. Sunshine becomes his wife and bears him a child. Jack again encounters Younger Bear, no longer a Contrary, is now the henpecked husband of the long-lost Olga. The traumatized Olga does not recognize Jack, who makes no attempt to make her remember him. Sunshine asks Jack to take in her three widowed sisters as wives, and to father children with them. He is reluctant at first, but finally agrees.\n\nA little later in November 1868, Custer and the 7th&nbsp;Cavalry make a surprise attack on the Cheyenne camp at the [[Battle of Washita River|Washita River]]. Jack saves the now-blind and elderly Old Lodge Skins, but Sunshine, their child, and her sisters are killed. Jack tries to infiltrate Custer's camp to exact revenge, but loses his nerve to kill Custer.\n\n===Mad hermit===\nDisheartened, Jack withdraws from life and becomes the town drunk living in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]] for the next several years. While in a drunken stupor, he is recognized by [[Wild Bill Hickok]], who gives him money to get cleaned up. Hickok is shot and killed while playing cards and, with his last breath, asks Jack to bring some money to a widow he was having an affair with. Jack visits the widow, now a prostitute who turns out to be Louise Pendrake. Jack gives her the money that Hickok intended for her to use to start a new life, but again rebuffs her sexual advances.\n\nJack soon becomes a [[Animal trapping|trapper]] and [[hermit]].

The film, however, is consistent with historical records of other encounters between Indians and the U.S. Cavalry; the Cavalry's common tactic was to wait until the warriors had left the camp to hunt, or to lure the warriors away with assurances of good hunting, and then to attack the unprotected village. The two massacre scenes are historically reversed, the [[Sand Creek massacre]] occurring first in 1864, where Colorado militia (not including Custer) attacked a peaceful contingent of Native Americans, killing more than 150 women, children and elderly men. (The Sand Creek Massacre was depicted in another 1970 Western, ''[[Soldier Blue]]''.) The Custer-led raid on the Washita occurred in 1868.\n\nThe film also presents an inaccurate representation of the death of [[Wild Bill Hickok]].  Hickok was actually killed nearly two months after the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] on August 2, 1876, while playing poker at [[Nuttal & Mann's Saloon]] in [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[South Dakota]].  Uncharacteristically, Hickok had his back turned to the door.  At 4:15&nbsp;p.m., a gunslinger named Jack McCall walked in and shot Hickok in the back of the head.  Hickok was famously holding two pairs\u2014of black aces and black eights\u2014when he was shot, a set of cards thereafter called the \"[[Dead Man's Hand]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/wild-bill-hickok-is-murdered |title=Wild Bill Hickok is murdered \u2014 History.com This Day in History \u2014 8/2/1876 |publisher=History.com |date=1953-08-05 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref>\n\nThe film's depiction of Lieutenant Colonel [[George Armstrong Custer]] as a lunatic at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] was intended as satire, though many of his quirks and vanities were inspired by contemporary observations.

In an interview Arthur Penn explained the change: \"We thought long and hard about this and in the first draft of the script he does die, but this death would have introduced an element of sadness into the film and we didn't want this. The film would have become dramatic, even melodramatic, instead of being [[picaresque]]. I also wanted to show that not only were the Indians going to be destroyed, but they were also condemned to live.

While broadly categorized as a western, or an [[epic film|epic]], the film encompasses several literary/film genres, including [[comedy film|comedy]], [[drama film|drama]] and [[adventure film|adventure]]. It is about a white male child raised by the [[Cheyenne]] nation during the 19th century. The film is largely concerned with contrasting the lives of [[Settler|American pioneers]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] throughout the progression of the boy's life.  It stars [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Chief Dan George]], [[Faye Dunaway]], [[Martin Balsam]], [[Jeff Corey]] and [[Richard Mulligan]].\n\nIt is a [[revisionist Western]]: Native Americans are depicted sympathetically, and the [[United States Cavalry]] are depicted as villains.  The revision uses elements of [[satire]] and [[tragedy]] to examine [[prejudice]] and injustice. ''Little Big Man'' is an [[New Hollywood|anti-establishment film]] of the period, indirectly protesting America's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] by portraying the [[United States Armed Forces]] negatively.<ref name=HollywoodsIndian/>\n\nIn 2014, ''Little Big Man'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"loc.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-14-210/new-films-added-to-national-registry/2014-12-17/|title=Cinematic Treasures Named to National Film Registry|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1970, 121&nbsp;year-old Jack Crabb, the oldest man in the world, is residing in a hospice and recounts his life story to a curious historian. Among other things, Crabb claims to have been a captive of the [[Cheyenne]], a [[gunslinger]], an associate of [[Wild Bill Hickok]], a scout for General [[George Armstrong Custer]], and the sole white survivor of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]].<ref name=HollywoodsIndian>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvLJQsO3O0oC&pg=PP2&dq=%22Little+Big+Man%22+film#v=onepage&q=%22Little%20Big%20Man%22%20film&f=false|title=Hollywood's Indian: The Portrayal of the Native American in Film|date=2011 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky|pages=121\u2013136|last1=Rollins|first1=Peter|isbn=978-0813131658}}</ref>\n\n===Childhood===\nJack begins his story in a flashback to 1859, when he was 10&nbsp;years old. He and his older sister Caroline survived the massacre of their pioneer parents by the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] and are discovered by Shadow, a [[Cheyenne]] brave, who takes the siblings to his village. Caroline escapes, but Jack remains and is reared by the good-hearted tribal leader, Old Lodge Skins.<ref name=HollywoodsIndian/>\n\nAs Jack gets older, he unwittingly makes an enemy of another boy, Younger Bear; however, Younger Bear eventually owes his life to Jack when he saves Younger Bear's life from a Pawnee brave. Jack is given the name \"Little Big Man\" because he is short but very brave.\n\nIn 1865, when Jack is 16, he is captured by U.S.&nbsp;Cavalry troopers during a skirmish and renounces his Cheyenne upbringing in order to save himself from being killed. After spending time in U.S. Army custody and going through interrogations and debriefing, Jack, being a minor, is put in the foster care of Reverend Silas Pendrake and his sexually frustrated wife, Louise, who tries to seduce Jack. When he witnesses Mrs.&nbsp;Pendrake having sex with the soda shop owner, Jack leaves the Pendrake household and renounces his foster parents and religion.\n\n===Gunslinger===\nIn 1866, Jack becomes the apprentice of the [[snake-oil]] salesman Meriweather. The two are [[tarred and feathered]] when their customers realize that Meriweather's products are fraudulent. One of the angry customers is Jack's now-grown sister, Caroline, with whom he reunites. She attempts to mold her brother into a gunslinger named \"the Soda Pop Kid\". Jack meets [[Wild Bill Hickok]] at a saloon, and Hickok takes a liking to the young man. When Hickok is forced to kill a man in self-defense, Jack loses his taste for gunslinging and Caroline deserts him.\n\nA year or so later, Jack becomes a partner in a [[general store]] and marries a Swedish woman named Olga. Jack\u2019s business partner turns out to be a thieving scoundrel. The famous cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer suggests the couple restart their lives further west and assures them they have nothing to fear from Indians.\n\nJack and Olga set out, but their [[stagecoach]] is ambushed by Cheyenne warriors. Olga is abducted and Jack sets out in search of her. He is reunited with Old Lodge Skins and Younger Bear. Younger Bear has become a [[Contrary (social role)|Contrary]] \u2013 a warrior who does everything in reverse. Jack makes friends with the [[two-spirit|Heemaneh]] Little Horse, but continues on his search for Olga.\n\n===First round with Custer===\nA few months later, Jack eventually becomes a \"[[Arriero|muleskinner]]\" in Custer's [[7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]], only because Custer incorrectly determines that was Jack's past job. He takes part in a battle against the Cheyenne, but when the troopers begin killing women and children, Jack turns on them.\n\nOn the outskirts of the massacre, Jack is attacked by Shadow, the Cheyenne warrior who saved him as a child but now does not recognize him. Shadow is killed by a cavalryman, and Jack discovers Shadow\u2019s daughter, Sunshine, giving birth while hiding from the onslaught. He returns with her to Old Lodge Skins\u2019s tribe. Sunshine becomes his wife and bears him a child. Jack again encounters Younger Bear, no longer a Contrary, is now the henpecked husband of the long-lost Olga. The traumatized Olga does not recognize Jack, who makes no attempt to make her remember him. Sunshine asks Jack to take in her three widowed sisters as wives, and to father children with them. He is reluctant at first, but finally agrees.\n\nA little later in November 1868, Custer and the 7th&nbsp;Cavalry make a surprise attack on the Cheyenne camp at the [[Battle of Washita River|Washita River]]. Jack saves the now-blind and elderly Old Lodge Skins, but Sunshine, their child, and her sisters are killed. Jack tries to infiltrate Custer's camp to exact revenge, but loses his nerve to kill Custer.\n\n===Mad hermit===\nDisheartened, Jack withdraws from life and becomes the town drunk living in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]] for the next several years. While in a drunken stupor, he is recognized by [[Wild Bill Hickok]], who gives him money to get cleaned up. Hickok is shot and killed while playing cards and, with his last breath, asks Jack to bring some money to a widow he was having an affair with. Jack visits the widow, now a prostitute who turns out to be Louise Pendrake. Jack gives her the money that Hickok intended for her to use to start a new life, but again rebuffs her sexual advances.\n\nJack soon becomes a [[Animal trapping|trapper]] and [[hermit]]. His mind becomes unhinged after coming across an empty trap with a severed animal limb. He prepares to commit suicide, but sees Custer and his troops marching nearby, and decides to return to his quest for revenge.\n\n===Second round with Custer===\nCuster hires Jack as a scout, reasoning that anything he says will be a lie, thus serving as a perfect reverse barometer. Jack tricks Custer into leading his troops into a trap at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Bighorn]] (1876) by truthfully telling Custer of the overwhelming force of Native Americans hidden within the valley.\n\nAs Custer's troops are slaughtered by the combined Sioux and Cheyenne group, Custer begins to rave insanely. Jack is wounded. The maddened Custer attempts to shoot Jack when he tells Custer to shut up, but is killed by Younger Bear, who then carries Jack away from the battlefield. Having thus discharged his life debt, Younger Bear tells Jack that the next time they meet, he can kill Jack without becoming an evil person.<ref name=HollywoodsIndian/>\n\n===Old Lodge Skins awaits death, as does Jack===\nBack at the Cheyenne camp, Jack accompanies Old Lodge Skins to a nearby hill, the Indian burial ground, where the old man, dressed in full chief's regalia, has declared \"It is a good day to die\", and decides to end his life with dignity. He offers his spirit to the [[Great Spirit]], and lies down at his spot at the Indian Burial Ground to wait for death.\n\nInstead, it begins to rain. Old Lodge Skins is revealed to still be alive, and says, \"Well, sometimes the magic works. Sometimes it doesn't.\" They return to his lodge to have dinner.<ref name=HollywoodsIndian/>\n\n===Epilogue===\n\nBack in the present day, Jack abruptly ends his narrative story and he dismisses the historian.

Of the makeup, Hoffman was quoted in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] as saying, \"I defy you to put on that makeup and not feel old\".<ref>[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']], November 20, 1970, volume 69 number 21, interview with [[Richard Meryman]]</ref> The role of Chief Old Lodge Skins was initially offered to [[Marlon Brando]], [[Paul Scofield]], and [[Laurence Olivier]], all of whom turned it down. The Little Bighorn battle scenes were filmed on location at [[Crow Agency, Montana]] near the actual battle site.  Some of the town scenes were filmed in [[Nevada City, Montana]], a town that by 1970 consisted predominantly of historic 19th-century buildings brought from elsewhere in Montana.\nAll outdoor Indian scenes other than the Little Bighorn battle were filmed near [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada.  Some interior and various footage was shot on Hollywood sets. All Indian extras were North American Indians.

In an interview Arthur Penn explained the change: \"We thought long and hard about this and in the first draft of the script he does die, but this death would have introduced an element of sadness into the film and we didn't want this. The film would have become dramatic, even melodramatic, instead of being [[picaresque]]. I also wanted to show that not only were the Indians going to be destroyed, but they were also condemned to live. On the whole, audiences like their entertainment dramatically compact and homogenous, but I want the opposite. A film should remain free and open, not with everything defined and resolved.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Penn|first=Arthur|title=Arthur Penn: interviews|year=2008|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-60473-104-0|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Obdm2EPUNusC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Arthur+Penn#v=onepage&q=little%20big%20man}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Little Big Man'' received widespread acclaim from film critics.

The picture is based on [[Raymond Chandler]]'s novel ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]'' (1940), which had previously been adapted for film as ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' in 1944.<ref>{{AFI film|id=55469|title=Farewell, My Lovely}}.</ref> The film also stars [[Charlotte Rampling]], [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]], [[Jack O'Halloran]], [[Sylvia Miles]] and [[Harry Dean Stanton]], with an early screen appearance by [[Sylvester Stallone]]. Mitchum returned to the role of Marlowe three years later in the 1978 film ''[[The Big Sleep (1978 film)|The Big Sleep]]'', making him the only actor to portray [[Philip Marlowe]] more than once on the big screen.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Los Angeles, 1941 - against a seamy backdrop of police corruption, cheap hotel rooms, illegal gambling and jewel trafficking - private detective Philip Marlowe is holed up in a hotel room and growing more weary by the hour. As he explains to his police lieutenant friend Nulty: \"I've got a hat, a coat and a gun; that's it.\"\n\nMarlowe has been hired by a huge and surly ex-convict, Moose Malloy, to find his old girlfriend Velma, whom he has not seen in seven years. At the same time, Marlowe is investigating the murder of a client named Marriott, who was a victim of blackmail and a stolen necklace made of jade.\n\nWhile encountering connections to both cases, Marlowe develops an attraction to the married and seductive Helen Grayle. As the body count mounts, Marlowe survives attempts on his life, which include being drugged and held captive by a psychotic brothel madam named Amthor, along with her thugs. The action comes to a head with a shootout on a gambling boat off the L.A. coast.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as [[Philip Marlowe]]\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Helen Grayle/Velma\n* [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]] as Lt.

The latter was a Philip Marlowe novel by Raymond Chandler and Kastner was keen  to film other Chandler novels. He had a script done which was set in contemporary LA and showed it to director Dick Richards. Richards was interested in filming the book, but only if it was a period piece.<ref name=\"dick\">{{cite web|website=World Cinema Parradise|url=http://worldcinemaparadise.com/2015/12/22/what-a-world-recreating-raymond-chandlers-los-angeles-for-farewell-my-lovely/|title=\u201cWhat a World\u201d: Recreating Raymond Chandler\u2019s Los Angeles for \u201cFarewell, My Lovely\u201d|first=Doug|last= Krentzlin |date=December 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRichards hired David Zelag Goodman to write the screenplay. They set the movie in 1941, so that they could stamp the film \"with a time mark\" by turning Marlowe into a baseball fan who followed Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak of that year.<ref name=\"dick\"/> \n===Finance===\nSir [[Lew Grade]] had previously invested in Kastner's film ''[[Dogpound Shuffle]]''. The producer approached him to invest in ''Farewell My Lovely'' and Grade agreed, knowing the movie could be easily be pre-sold to television.<ref name=\"grade\">Lew Grade, ''Still Dancing: My Story'', William Collins & Sons 1987 p 246</ref> The movie would be part of Grade's initial slate of ten feature films,  including ''[[The Return of the Pink Panther]]'', ''Man Friday'' and ''The Tamarind Seed''.<ref>Sir Lew's massive film deal\nBarker, Dennis. The Guardian 22 Oct 1975: 7.</ref>\n===Casting===\nAccording to Mitchum, Kastner originally wanted the role of Philip Marlowe to be played by [[Richard Burton]], with whom Kastner had worked a number of times. However, Burton was busy so they approached Mitchum. (Richards says he was only ever interested in doing the film with Mitchum.<ref name=\"dick\"/> The star later recalled:\n<blockquote>The producer, Elliott Kastner, comes by with Sir Lew Grade, the British tycoon. He has a black suit, a black tie, a white shirt and a whiter face. 'I know nothing about motion pictures,' Sir Lew says. 'What I know is entertainment: Ferris wheels, pony rides.' I suggested we buy up the rights to ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' with [[Dick Powell]], re-release it and go to the beach. But, no, they hired a director, Dick Richards, so nervous he can't hold his legs still. They have all the hide rubbed off them, He started doing TV commercials. He was accustomed to, you know, start the camera, expose 120 feet of film and tell somebody to move the beer bottle half an inch clockwise.

Grade financed that movie as well.<ref name=\"grade\"/>\n\nMarlowe's client, Moose Malloy, is played by Jack O'Halloran, a former professional prizefighter. Mitchum called O'Halloran \"one great find on this picture. At least, he's a find if we can ever find him again... They hired him for $500 a week. He looked perfect for the part. One time he hit the producer. One of the producers. We had seven of them. We called them the Magnificent Seven. Jack was swinging this poor bastard around his head like an Indian war club. I tried to explain to him: 'The guy can be talked to, Jack.' He shakes his head. 'Mitch,' he says, 'I was crying too hard.'\"<ref name=\"mitchum\"/>\n\nSylvester Stallone, in an early role prior to ''[[Rocky]]'', has a brief role as an employee of the brothel's sadistic madam (played by Kate Murtagh).\n\n[[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]], author of popular crime novels like ''[[The Getaway (novel)|The Getaway]]'' and ''[[The Grifters (novel)|The Grifters]]'', appears in the film as Judge Grayle.\n\n[[Joe Spinell]], who played Willi Cicci in ''[[The Godfather]]'' and Stallone's boss in ''[[Rocky]]'', is featured as Nicky, a hired thug for Frances Amthor. Spinell was in poor health, but his friend Mitchum made sure that Spinell's scenes were filmed first, so that he could get to the doctors if required.\n\n===Production===\nMitchum says Charlotte Rampling \"arrived with an odd entourage, two husbands or something. Or they were friends and she married one of them and he grew a mustache and butched up. She kept exercising her mouth like she was trying to swallow her ear. I played her on the right side because she had two great big blackheads on her left ear, and I was afraid they'd spring out and lodge on my lip.\"<ref name=\"mitchum\"/>\n\nMitchum later admitted \"This kid Richards, the director, he's got something.

Is the ambience going to be maintained, or will this be another campy rip-off? Half an hour into the movie, we relax. ''Farewell, My Lovely'' never steps wrong...in the genre itself there hasn't been anything this good since Hollywood was doing Philip Marlowe the first time around. One reason is that Dick Richards, the director, takes his material and character absolutely seriously. He is not uneasy with it, as Robert Altman was when he had Elliott Gould flirt with seriousness in ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]''. Richards doesn't hedge his bet.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/farewell-my-lovely-1975 |title=Farewell, My Lovely |last=Ebert |first=Roger |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=January 1, 1975}}</ref>\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that \"if a remake of ''Farewell, My Lovely'' isn't something fresh\u2014and following on the heels of ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' doesn't make it any fresher \u2014 at least the casting of Mitchum as Marlowe was inspired.

Mitchum returned to the role of Marlowe three years later in the 1978 film ''[[The Big Sleep (1978 film)|The Big Sleep]]'', making him the only actor to portray [[Philip Marlowe]] more than once on the big screen.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Los Angeles, 1941 - against a seamy backdrop of police corruption, cheap hotel rooms, illegal gambling and jewel trafficking - private detective Philip Marlowe is holed up in a hotel room and growing more weary by the hour. As he explains to his police lieutenant friend Nulty: \"I've got a hat, a coat and a gun; that's it.\"\n\nMarlowe has been hired by a huge and surly ex-convict, Moose Malloy, to find his old girlfriend Velma, whom he has not seen in seven years. At the same time, Marlowe is investigating the murder of a client named Marriott, who was a victim of blackmail and a stolen necklace made of jade.\n\nWhile encountering connections to both cases, Marlowe develops an attraction to the married and seductive Helen Grayle. As the body count mounts, Marlowe survives attempts on his life, which include being drugged and held captive by a psychotic brothel madam named Amthor, along with her thugs. The action comes to a head with a shootout on a gambling boat off the L.A. coast.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as [[Philip Marlowe]]\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Helen Grayle/Velma\n* [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]] as Lt.

The latter was a Philip Marlowe novel by Raymond Chandler and Kastner was keen  to film other Chandler novels. He had a script done which was set in contemporary LA and showed it to director Dick Richards. Richards was interested in filming the book, but only if it was a period piece.<ref name=\"dick\">{{cite web|website=World Cinema Parradise|url=http://worldcinemaparadise.com/2015/12/22/what-a-world-recreating-raymond-chandlers-los-angeles-for-farewell-my-lovely/|title=\u201cWhat a World\u201d: Recreating Raymond Chandler\u2019s Los Angeles for \u201cFarewell, My Lovely\u201d|first=Doug|last= Krentzlin |date=December 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRichards hired David Zelag Goodman to write the screenplay. They set the movie in 1941, so that they could stamp the film \"with a time mark\" by turning Marlowe into a baseball fan who followed Joe DiMaggio\u2019s hitting streak of that year.<ref name=\"dick\"/> \n===Finance===\nSir [[Lew Grade]] had previously invested in Kastner's film ''[[Dogpound Shuffle]]''. The producer approached him to invest in ''Farewell My Lovely'' and Grade agreed, knowing the movie could be easily be pre-sold to television.<ref name=\"grade\">Lew Grade, ''Still Dancing: My Story'', William Collins & Sons 1987 p 246</ref> The movie would be part of Grade's initial slate of ten feature films,  including ''[[The Return of the Pink Panther]]'', ''Man Friday'' and ''The Tamarind Seed''.<ref>Sir Lew's massive film deal\nBarker, Dennis. The Guardian 22 Oct 1975: 7.</ref>\n===Casting===\nAccording to Mitchum, Kastner originally wanted the role of Philip Marlowe to be played by [[Richard Burton]], with whom Kastner had worked a number of times. However, Burton was busy so they approached Mitchum. (Richards says he was only ever interested in doing the film with Mitchum.<ref name=\"dick\"/> The star later recalled:\n<blockquote>The producer, Elliott Kastner, comes by with Sir Lew Grade, the British tycoon. He has a black suit, a black tie, a white shirt and a whiter face. 'I know nothing about motion pictures,' Sir Lew says. 'What I know is entertainment: Ferris wheels, pony rides.' I suggested we buy up the rights to ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' with [[Dick Powell]], re-release it and go to the beach. But, no, they hired a director, Dick Richards, so nervous he can't hold his legs still. They have all the hide rubbed off them, He started doing TV commercials. He was accustomed to, you know, start the camera, expose 120 feet of film and tell somebody to move the beer bottle half an inch clockwise. He does the same thing with people.<ref name=\"mitchum\">{{cite web|website=Roger Ebert|title= Robert Mitchum: \"Bring me a Miltown, sweetheart.\"|first=Roger|last=Ebert|date=\nJune 17, 1975|url= http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/robert-mitchum-bring-me-a-miltown-sweetheart}}</ref></blockquote>\nMitchum reprised the role of [[Philip Marlowe]] three years later in ''[[The Big Sleep (1978 film)|The Big Sleep]]'', although that remake was set in the present day and in England, rather than shot as a period piece in the detective's customary setting of Los Angeles. Grade financed that movie as well.<ref name=\"grade\"/>\n\nMarlowe's client, Moose Malloy, is played by Jack O'Halloran, a former professional prizefighter. Mitchum called O'Halloran \"one great find on this picture. At least, he's a find if we can ever find him again... They hired him for $500 a week. He looked perfect for the part. One time he hit the producer. One of the producers. We had seven of them. We called them the Magnificent Seven. Jack was swinging this poor bastard around his head like an Indian war club. I tried to explain to him: 'The guy can be talked to, Jack.' He shakes his head. 'Mitch,' he says, 'I was crying too hard.'\"<ref name=\"mitchum\"/>\n\nSylvester Stallone, in an early role prior to ''[[Rocky]]'', has a brief role as an employee of the brothel's sadistic madam (played by Kate Murtagh).\n\n[[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]], author of popular crime novels like ''[[The Getaway (novel)|The Getaway]]'' and ''[[The Grifters (novel)|The Grifters]]'', appears in the film as Judge Grayle.\n\n[[Joe Spinell]], who played Willi Cicci in ''[[The Godfather]]'' and Stallone's boss in ''[[Rocky]]'', is featured as Nicky, a hired thug for Frances Amthor. Spinell was in poor health, but his friend Mitchum made sure that Spinell's scenes were filmed first, so that he could get to the doctors if required.\n\n===Production===\nMitchum says Charlotte Rampling \"arrived with an odd entourage, two husbands or something. Or they were friends and she married one of them and he grew a mustache and butched up. She kept exercising her mouth like she was trying to swallow her ear. I played her on the right side because she had two great big blackheads on her left ear, and I was afraid they'd spring out and lodge on my lip.\"<ref name=\"mitchum\"/>\n\nMitchum later admitted \"This kid Richards, the director, he's got something. It'll be a good picture.\"<ref name=\"mitchum\"/>\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\nAn original motion picture vinyl soundtrack album composed by [[David Shire]] was released in 1975 by [[United Artists Records]].

Is the ambience going to be maintained, or will this be another campy rip-off? Half an hour into the movie, we relax. ''Farewell, My Lovely'' never steps wrong...in the genre itself there hasn't been anything this good since Hollywood was doing Philip Marlowe the first time around. One reason is that Dick Richards, the director, takes his material and character absolutely seriously. He is not uneasy with it, as Robert Altman was when he had Elliott Gould flirt with seriousness in ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]''. Richards doesn't hedge his bet.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/farewell-my-lovely-1975 |title=Farewell, My Lovely |last=Ebert |first=Roger |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=January 1, 1975}}</ref>\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that \"if a remake of ''Farewell, My Lovely'' isn't something fresh\u2014and following on the heels of ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' doesn't make it any fresher \u2014 at least the casting of Mitchum as Marlowe was inspired. Mitchum, the actor who makes nodding off seem glamorous, plays Marlowe with a delicious ease. He sounds just like Marlowe should sound.\"<ref>[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (August 22, 1975). \"Mitchum turns a remake into a 'lovely' experience.\" ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 3, p. 3.</ref>\n\nA review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was more critical, calling it \"a lethargic, vaguely campy tribute to Hollywood's private eye mellers of the 1940s and to writer Raymond Chandler, whose Philip Marlowe character has inspired a number of features. Despite an impressive production and some firstrate performances, this third version fails to generate much suspense or excitement.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Farewell, My Lovely |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790831.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 |work=Variety |date=January 1, 1975}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Eder]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the film as \"a handsome mediocrity\" with an ending that \"may produce some confusion,\" though he praised \"the high quality of a lot of the acting\".<ref>[[Richard Eder|Eder, Richard]] (August 14, 1975). \"Screen: Detective Yarn\". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 39.</ref>\n\n[[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the score by David Shire and the casting of Mitchum as Marlowe both seemed \"exactly right\", but criticized the voice-over narrative, finding that \"the effect undercuts the visual splendors and reveals the plot complications at their most preposterous. Too bad, because it breaks the fine mood Richards & Company establish and makes ''Farewell, My Lovely'' an interesting but mixed blessing instead of the unmitigated triumph it almost was.\"<ref>[[Charles Champlin|Champlin, Charles]] (August 20, 1975). \"'Lovely' Catches Look of the'40s\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> \n\nFilm critic Dennis Schwartz believes that actor Robert Mitchum was well-cast and wrote, \"The film's success lies in Mitchum's hard-boiled portrayal of Marlowe, its twisty plot and the moody atmosphere it creates through John A. Alonzo's photography. Los Angeles looms as a nighttime playground for hoods, beautiful women and suckers ready to be taken by all the glitzy signs leading them astray.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/farewellmylovely.htm |first=Schwartz |last=Dennis |title=Farewell, My Lovely |work=Ozus' World Movie Reviews |date=November 21, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe film maintains an 80% film rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], from 20 reviews.<ref>{{Rotten-tomatoes|1007110-farewell_my_lovely|title=Farewell, My Lovely}}.

About 136 containers will be transported daily with a four-day-per-week schedule.\n\nAn overpass is to be built across Potash Road so haul trucks will never encounter highway traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moabtimes.com/2007/10/10/70100-doe-reveals-details-of-plan-to-relocate-atlas-tailings-pile/|title=DOE reveals details of plan to relocate Atlas tailings pile|first=|last=Archivist|date=10 October 2007|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nRail shipments began in April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coyotegulch.blog/2009/03/09/moab-tailings-pile-movement-by-rail-to-start-april-20th/|title=Moab tailings pile: Movement by rail to start April 20th|first=Coyote|last=Gulch|date=10 March 2009|publisher=}}</ref>  The clean trucks were replaced by the rail line, with the containers still needed to be lidded as before.  On March 3, 2010, the Department of Energy announced it had shipped one million tons of tailings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/em/office-environmental-management|title=Office of Environmental Management|website=Energy.gov}}</ref>\n\nAs of February 2014, 6.5 million tons of tailing (41%) have been removed. A well field is located between the tailing pile and the river, which extracts and purifies groundwater before it enters the Colorado river. As of February 2014 {{convert|799,000|lb}} of ammonia and {{convert|3990|lb}} of uranium have been extracted from the wells. During low water periods, fresh water is injected into the wells.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shenton|first=Lee|title=Moab UMTRA Project: February 2014|url=http://www.grandcountyutah.net/pdf/UMTRA_Status.pdf|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref> On July 29, 2014 the 7 millionth ton of tailing was placed in the disposal cell.<ref name=gjem.energy.gov>{{cite web|title=Moab, Utah, UMTRA, Project -- Disposal Cell|url=http://www.gjem.energy.gov/moab/general/disposalcell.html|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Disposal site==\nThe tailings and other contaminated material are being buried near [[Crescent Junction, Utah]], northeast of the junction of [[Interstate 70]] and [[U.S. Route 191]], about 30 miles from the tailing pile.<ref name=overview>{{cite web|title=Over view of Moab UMTRA Pr oject|url=http://www.gjem.energy.gov/moab/documents/factsheets/20130625OVERVIEW.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2014|date=June 2013}}</ref> Excavation occurs in phases, two of which are complete as of July 2014. Each phase is about {{convert|45|acres}} and is excavated to about {{convert|25|ft}}. The contaminated material is first covered by a minimum {{convert|1|ft|spell=in|adj=on}} layer of interim fill, then by a {{convert|4|ft|spell=in|adj=on}} radon barrier composed of weathered mancos shale, a {{convert|6|in|spell=in|adj=on}} layer of sandy gravel as an infiltration and biointrusion layer, and {{convert|3|ft}} of a frost protection layer composed of both soil and weathered shale. The cell is then topped with {{convert|6|in}} of rock. Cover material is sourced locally and from [[Fremont Junction, Utah]].<ref name=gjem.energy.gov />\n\nWhen finished, the cell will be about {{convert|5200|ft}} long and {{convert|2400|ft}} wide. It is estimated to be about {{convert|25|ft}} above ground and will be fenced. Currently the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] owns {{convert|500|acres}} of land and has another {{convert|936|acres}} in a 20-year withdrawal for the disposal cell, buffer space, support area, and access road.<ref name=overview />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.moabtailings.org MoabTailings.org]\n*[http://www.wise-uranium.org/udmoa.html Decommissioning of Moab, Utah, Uranium Mill Tailings]\n\n[[Category:Geography of Grand County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Uranium mining in the United States]]\n[[Category:Moab, Utah]]\n[[Category:Mining in Utah]]\n", "name_user": "Tdorsloppy34", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDOE plan for re-location", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moab_uranium_mill_tailings_pile"}
