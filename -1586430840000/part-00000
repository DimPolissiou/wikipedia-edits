According to the traditional literature, Ragnar Lodbrok distinguished himself by many raids against the [[British Isles]] and [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the 9th century. According to the sagas Ragnar Lodbrok's father was the [[Legendary Kings of Sweden|legendary Swedish king]] [[Sigurd Ring]]. <ref>https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Ragnar-Lothbrok/</ref>\n\n== Accounts ==\n=== The Icelandic Sagas ===\nAccording to the ''[[Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok]]'', ''[[Tale of Ragnar's sons]]'', ''[[Heimskringla]]'', ''[[Hervarar Saga]]'', ''[[S\u00f6gubrot]]'', and many other Icelandic sources, Ragnar was the son of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] king [[Sigurd Ring]]. Nearly all of the sagas agree that the [[Denmark|Danish]] king [[Randver]] was Sigurd's father, with the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' citing his wife as \u00c5sa, the daughter of King [[Harald Granraude|Harald of the Red Moustache]] from Norway. The accounts further tell that Randver was a grandson of the legendary Scandinavian king [[Ivar Vidfamne]] by his daughter Aud (whom the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' calls Alfhild).<ref>Tolkien, Christopher, & Turville-Petre, G. (eds) (1956) ''Hervarar Saga ok Heidreks''. London: Viking Society for Northern Research, p. 68-9. [http://www.vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Text%20Series/Hervarar%20saga%20ok%20heidreks.pdf]\n</ref> After the death of king [[Ivar Vidfamne]], Aud's eldest son by the [[Danes|Danish]] king [[Hr\u0153rekr Ringslinger]], Harald, conquered all of his grandfather's territory and became known why do we care anymore [[Sigurd Ring]] became the chief king of Sweden after Randver's death (Denmark according to ''Hervarar saga''), presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd and Harald fought the Battle of the Br\u00e1vellir ([[Br\u00e5valla]]) on the plains of [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]], where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd then ruled Sweden and Denmark (being sometimes identified with a Danish king [[Sigfred]] who ruled from about 770 until his death prior to 804). He sired a son with the Norwegian princess Alfhild of the semi-mythical \u00c1lfar people, Ragnar Lodbrok, who succeeded him.<ref>''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 10 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm]</ref> [[Eysteinn Beli]], who according to the ''[[Hervarar Saga]]'' was Harald Wartooth's son, ruled Sweden sometime after Sigurd until he was slain by the sons of Ragnar and [[Aslaug]].<ref>''The Tale of Ragnar's Sons'', Chapter 2 [http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/ThattrRagnarsSonar.html]</ref> \n\nIn their accounts of his reign, the Sagas of Icelandic Prehistory, known as [[fornaldarsaga]]<ref>http://fasnl.ku.dk/</ref> <ref>''fornaldars\u00f6gur'', chapter 25, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312033326_Sagas_of_Icelandic_Prehistory_fornaldarsogur]</ref> tell more about Ragnar's marriages than about feats of warfare. According to the ''[[Sogubrot|S\u00f6gubrot]]'', \"he was the biggest and fairest of men that human eyes have seen, and he was like his mother in appearance and took after her kin\".<ref>''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 10 [[https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm]</ref> He first killed a giant snake that guarded the abode of the [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland|East Geatic]] jarl's daughter [[Thora Borgarhjort]], thereby winning her as his wife. The unusual protective clothes that Ragnar wore, when attacking the serpent, earned him the nickname Lodbrok (\"shaggy breeches\"). His sons with Thora were [[Erik Weatherhat|Erik]] and Agnar. After Thora died, he discovered [[Aslaug|Kr\u00e1ka]], a woman of outstanding beauty and wisdom living with a poor peasant couple in [[Norway]], and married her. This marriage resulted in the sons [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]], [[Hvitserk]], Ragnvald and [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]].<ref>''Ragnars Saga Lodbrokar'', Chapters 4 and 7 [https://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/ragnar.htm]</ref> Kr\u00e1ka was later revealed to actually be [[Aslaug]], a secret daughter of the renowned hero [[Sigurd|Sigurd Fafnesbane]]. As the sons grew up to become renowned warriors, Ragnar, not wishing to be outdone, resolved to conquer [[England]] with merely two ships. He was however defeated by superior English forces and was thrown into a snake pit to die in agony.<ref>''Ragnars Saga Lodbrokar'', Chapter 15 [https://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/ragnar.htm]</ref> The ''[[Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok]]'', ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons]]'', and ''[[Heimskringla]]'' all tell of the [[Great Heathen Army]] that invaded England at around 866, led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok to wreak revenge against King [[\u00c6lla of Northumbria]] who is told to have captured and executed Ragnar.\n\n=== Danish sources ===\nThe ''[[Chronicon Roskildense]]'' (c. 1138) mentions Lodbrok (Lothpardus) as father to the utterly cruel Norse King Ywar (rex crudelissimus Normannorum Ywar) and his brothers, Inguar (a double of Ywar), Ubbi, Byorn and Ulf, who rule the northern peoples. They call on the various Danish petty kings to help them ruin the realm of the [[Franks]]. Ywar successfully attacks the kingdoms of [[Great Britain|Britain]], though not as an act of revenge as in the Icelandic sagas.<ref>''Chronicon Roskildense'', p. 16[https://archive.org/stream/scriptoresminore112gert#page/16/mode/2up]</ref> The chronicle of [[Sven Aggesen]] (c. 1190) is the first Danish text that mentions the full name, Regnerus Lothbrogh. His son Sigurd invades Denmark and kills its king, whose daughter he marries as he takes over the throne. Their son in turn is [[Hardeknud I|Knut]], ancestor of the later Danish kings.<ref>Sven Aggeson, p. 106[https://archive.org/stream/scriptoresminore112gert#page/106/mode/2up]</ref> \n\nNeither of these sources mentions Ragnar Lodbrok as a Danish ruler. The first to do so is [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (c. 1200). This work mixes Norse legend with data about Danish history derived from the chronicle of [[Adam of Bremen]] (c. 1075).<ref>Storm (1877), p. 387-9 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=399] </ref> Here Ragnar's father Sigurd Ring is a Norwegian prince married to a Danish princess, and different from the victor of Br\u00e1vellir (who had flourished about thirteen generations earlier). Sigurd Ring and his cousin and rival Ring (that is, [[Sigfred (Danish king 812)|Sigfred]] and [[Anulo]] of recorded history, d. 812) are both killed in battle, whereupon Ragnar is elevated to the Danish kingship (identified by Saxo with [[Reginfrid|Ragnfred]], d. 814<ref>Storm (1877), p. 399 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=411]</ref>).<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 539-41 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/541]</ref>  His first deed is the defeat of the Swedish king Fr\u00f6, who has killed Ragnar's grandfather. Ragnar is assisted in this by the ferocious shield-maiden [[Ladgerda]], whom he forces to marry him. In this marriage he sires the son Fridleif and two daughters.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 542-3 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/543]</ref>  He later repudiates the unreliable Ladgerda and instead wins the daughter of the Swedish king [[Herrau\u00f0r]], [[Thora Borgarhjort|Thora]], after killing two venomous giant snakes that guard her residence. His sons with Thora are Radbard, Dunvat, [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]], Agnar and [[Ivar the Boneless]]. From a non-marital affair with the daughter of one Esbj\u00f8rn, Ragnar begets [[Ubba|Ubbe]], while his last marriage with Svanlaug produces another three sons, Ragnvald, [[Eric Weatherhat]] and [[Hvitserk]].<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 545, 550 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/550]</ref> \n\nThe sons were installed as sub-kings in various conquered territories. Ragnar led a Viking expedition to England and slew its king Hama, proceeding to kill the earls of [[Scotland]] and install Sigurd Snake-in-the Eye and Radbard as governors. Norway was also subjugated, and Fridleif was made ruler there and in [[Orkney]]. Later on, Ragnar with three sons invaded Sweden where a new king called S\u00f6rle had appeared and withheld the heritage of Thora's sons. S\u00f6rle and his army were massacred and Bj\u00f6rn Ironside was installed on the throne.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 551 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/551]</ref>  Some time later Bj\u00f6rn was put in charge of Norway, while Ragnar appointed another son, Eric Weatherhat, as ruler in Sweden; he was subsequently killed by a certain [[Eysteinn Beli|Eysteinn]]. One of the sons, Ubbe, revolted against his father at the instigation of his maternal grandfather Esbj\u00f8rn, and could only be defeated and captured with utmost effort.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 557 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/557]</ref> Saxo moreover tells of repeated expeditions to the [[British Isles]], one of which cost the lives of Dunvat and Radbard. \u00c6lla, son of Hama, expelled Ragnar's sub-ruler Ivar the Boneless from England with the help of the Galli (Gaill, Hiberno-Norse?<ref>Smyth (1977).</ref>) and remained a persistent enemy.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 560-1 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/560]</ref> Finally, the [[Scythians]] were forced to accept Hvitserk as their ruler. In the end Hvitserk was treacherously captured by the [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontian]] prince Daxon and burnt alive with his own admission. Hearing this, Ragnar led an expedition to [[Kievan Rus']] and captured Daxon who was curiously spared and exiled.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 558-9 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/558]</ref> \n\nUnlike the Icelandic sources, Saxo's account of Ragnar Lodbrok's reign is largely a catalog of successful Viking invasions over an enormous geographical area. Among the seaborne expeditions was one against the [[Bjarmians]] and [[Finns]] ([[Sami people|Saami]]) in the Arctic north. The Bjarmian use of magic spells caused foul weather and the sudden death of many Danish invaders, and the Finnish archers on skis turned out to be a formidable foe. Eventually these two tribes were put to flight and the Bjarmian king was slain.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 558-9 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/554]</ref> The historical king [[Harald Klak]] is by Saxo (based on a passage in Adam's chronicle) made into another persistent enemy of Ragnar, who several times incited the [[Jutes]] and [[Sk\u00e5ne|Scanians]] to rebel, but was regularly defeated. After the last victory over Harald, Ragnar learned that King \u00c6lla had massacred Ragnar's men on [[Ireland]]. Incensed, he attacked the English king with his fleet but was captured and thrown into the snake pit, similar to the Icelandic sagas. In spite of all his praise for Ragnar Lodbrok, Saxo also considers his fate as God's rightful vengeance for the contempt he had shown the Christian religion.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 562-3 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/563]</ref>\n\n=== Poetic and epigraphic sources ===\nWhile the narrative Norse sources date from the 12th and 13th centuries, there are also many older poems that mention him and his kin. The ''[[Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa]]'', ostensibly composed by [[Bragi Boddason]] in the 9th century, praises a Ragnar, son of Sigurd, for a richly decorated shield that the poet has received. The shield depicts the assault on [[Ermanaric|J\u00f6rmunrek]], the [[Hja\u00f0ningav\u00edg]] tale, the ploughing of [[Gefjon]], and [[Thor]]'s struggle with the [[Midgard Serpent]]. Recent scholarship has suggested that the poem is in fact from c. 1000 and celebrates the Norse reconquest of England. The four tales depicted on the shield would then symbolize four aspects of the Lodbrok saga (the initial defeat of the sons of Lodbrok in England due to recklessness, Ivar the Boneless's deceitful approach to King \u00c6lla, Ivar's cunning snatching of land from \u00c6lla, Ragnar's struggle against the giant serpent in order to win Thora).<ref>\"Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa\", ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 24, p. 115.</ref> The ''Knutsdrapa'' of [[Sigvat Thordarson]] (c. 1038) mentions the death of \u00c6lla at the hands of Ivar in [[York]], who \"carved the eagle on \u00c6lla's back\".<ref>Smyth (1977), p. 193-4.</ref> From this the story of the atrocious revenge of Lodbrok's sons already seems to be present. The reference to a \"[[blood eagle]]\" punishment has however been much debated by modern scholars.<ref>[[Rory McTurk]], \"Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria\", [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171200/http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm]</ref> Another lay, ''[[Krakumal]]'', put in the mouth of the dying Ragnar in the snake pit, recounts the exploits of Ragnar and mentions battles over a wide geographical area, several relating to the British isles. The poem's name, \"Kr\u00e1ka's lay\", alludes to Ragnar's wife's [[Aslaug|Kr\u00e1ka]],<ref>\"Kr\u00e1kum\u00e1l\", ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 17 (2001), p. 299-300.</ref> though modern philologists commonly date it to the 12th century in its present form.<ref>Smyth (1977), p. 73-80.</ref> \n\nThere is one runic inscription mentioning Lodbrok, carved on the prehistorical tumulus of [[Maeshowe]] on [[Orkney]] in the early 12th century. It reads: \"This howe was built a long time before Lodbrok's. Her sons, they were bold; scarcely ever were there such tall men of their hands\".<ref>Smyth (1977), p. 81.</ref> The expression \"her sons\" has given rise to the theory that Lodbrok was originally thought of as a woman,<ref>Gustav Storm (1877), \"Ragnar Lodbrok og Lodbrokss\u00f8nnerne; studie i dansk oldhistorie og nordisk sagnhistorie\", ''Historisk Tidskrift'' II:1 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639;view=1up;seq=419]</ref> mother of the historically known sons.<ref>[[Rory McTurk]], \"Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria\", [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171200/http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm]; </ref>\n\n=== Frankish accounts of a 9th-century Viking leader named Ragnar ===\nThe [[Siege of Paris (845)|Siege of Paris]] and the Sack of Paris of 845 was the culmination of a Viking invasion of the kingdom of the [[West Francia|West Franks]]. The Viking forces were led by a Norse chieftain named \"Reginherus\", or Ragnar.{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}}  This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok,<ref>''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 24, p. 111, 113, 116.</ref> but the accuracy of this is disputed by historians.{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}}{{Sfn | Sprague | 2007 | p = 225}} Ragnar Lodbrok is also sometimes identified with a Ragnar who was awarded land in [[Torhout]], [[Flanders]], by [[Charles the Bald]] in about 841 but eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the King.{{Sfn | Sawyer | 2001 | p = 40}}  Ragnar's Vikings raided [[Rouen]] on their way up the Seine in 845  and in response to the invasion, determined not to let the royal [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]] (near Paris) be destroyed, Charles assembled an army which he divided into two parts, one for each side of the river.{{Sfn | Duckett | 1988 | p = 181}}{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 |  p = 212}} Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army, took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine to honour the [[Norse religion|Norse god]] [[Odin]], as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces.{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}}{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}} Ragnar's fleet made it back to his overlord, the Danish King [[Horik I]], but Ragnar soon died from a violent illness that also spread in Denmark.<ref>Storm (1877), p. 438 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=450]</ref>\n\n=== Later continental accounts ===\nAmong the oldest texts to mention the name Lodbrok is the Norman history of [[William of Jumi\u00e8ges]] from c. 1070. According to William, the Danish kings of old had the custom to expel the younger sons from the kingdom to have them out of the way. At a time it happened that King [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Lodbrok]] succeeded his unnamed father on the Danish throne. After gaining power he honoured the said custom and ordered his junior son [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]] to leave his realm. Bj\u00f6rn thus left Denmark with a considerable fleet and started to ravage in [[West Francia]] and later the [[Mediterranean]].<ref>Guillaume de Jumi\u00e8ges, ''Histoire des ducs de Normandie'', p. 11-3 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013753564;view=1up;seq=23]</ref> Roughly contemporary with William is [[Adam of Bremen]] whose history of the [[Archbishopric of Hamburg|Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]] contains many traditions about Viking Age Scandinavia. In a passage referring to the Viking raids of the late 9th century, he mentions the Danish or Norse pirates Horich, Orwig, Gotafrid, Rudolf and Inguar (Ivar). This Ivar is in particular seen as a cruel persecutor of Christians, and a son of Lodbrok (Inguar, filius Lodparchi).<ref>Adam von Bremen, ''Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte'', p. 39-40[https://archive.org/stream/adamvonbremenham00adam#page/40/mode/2up]</ref>\n\n=== Anglo-Saxon and Irish accounts of the father of Ivar and Halfdan ===\nAccording to the contemporary ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and [[Asser]]'s ''Life of Alfred'', in 878 the \"brother of Hingwar and Healfden\", with a naval fleet, a contingent of the [[Great Heathen Army]] invaded [[Devon]] in England and fought the [[Battle of Cynwit]]. There the Vikings lost, their king slain and many dead, with few escaping to their ships. After the battle the [[Saxons]] took great plunder, and among other things the banner called \"Raven\".<ref>Garmonsway, G.N. (1972), ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. London: Dent, p. 75-7.</ref> The early 12th century ''[[Annals of St Neots]]'' further state that ''\"they say that the three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, daughters of Lodebroch (Lodbrok), wove that flag and got it ready in one day. They say, moreover, that in every battle, wherever the flag went before them, if they were to gain the victory a live crow would appear flying on the middle of the flag; but if they were doomed to be defeated it would hang down motionless, and this was often proved to be so.\"''<ref>Garmonsway, G.N. (1972), ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. London: Dent, p. 77.</ref>\nThis is among the earlier references to the legendary hero Ragnar Lodbrok.\n\nThe Irish ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'' from the 12th century, with information deriving from earlier annals, mentions king Halfdan (d. 877) under the name \"mac Ragnaill\".<ref>James Todd (1867), ''Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh'', London: Longman, p. 27 [https://archive.org/details/cogadhgaedhelreg00todd/page/26/mode/2up]</ref> The form Ragnall may refer to either Ragnvald or Ragnar, and the entry is a strong indication that the name of Ivar's and Halfdan's father was really Ragnar or a similar name.<ref>Smyth, Alfred P. (1977) ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 263, 279.</ref> The early 11th century ''[[Three Fragments]]'' contains a passage that gives a semi-legendary background to the capture of York by the Vikings in 866. The two younger sons of Halfdan, King of [[Lochlann]], expelled the eldest son Ragnall who sailed to the [[Orkney islands]] with his three sons and settled there. Two of the sons later raided the English and [[Franks]], proceeding to plunder in the Mediterranean. One of them learnt from a vision that Ragnall had fought a battle where the third son had been slain and in which he himself had most likely perished. The two Viking sons then returned home with a lot of dark-skinned captives.<ref>Smyth, Alfred P. (1977) ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880''.

Modern academia regards most of the stories about him to be fiction. According to [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]], writing in 1979,\n\n<blockquote>Certain scholars in recent years have come to accept at least part of Ragnar's story as based on historical fact.<ref>Davidson p. 277</ref></blockquote> A generation later, however, Katherine Holman wrote in 2003: <blockquote>Although his sons are historical figures, there is no evidence that Ragnar himself ever lived and he seems to be an amalgam of historical figures and literary invention.<ref name=\"Z\">Holman 2003 p. 220</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe most significant medieval sources that mention Ragnar include:\n* Book IX of the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', a 12th-century work by the Christian Danish chronicler [[Saxo Grammaticus]]\n* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|Tale of Ragnar's sons]]'' (''Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr''), a [[legendary saga]]\n* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar Lothbrok ]]'', another saga, a sequel to the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]''\n* the ''[[Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa]]'', a [[skaldic poem]] of which only fragments remain, attributed to the 9th-century poet [[Bragi Boddason]]\n* the ''[[Kr\u00e1kum\u00e1l]]'', Ragnar's death-song, an old and mysterious skaldic poem\n\nIn her commentary on Saxo's ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', Davidson notes that Saxo's coverage of Ragnar's legend in book IX of the ''Gesta'' appears to be an attempt to consolidate many of the confusing and contradictory events and stories known to the chronicler into the reign of one king, Ragnar. That is why many acts ascribed to Ragnar in the ''Gesta'' can be associated, through other sources, with various figures, some of whom are more historically tenable.<ref>Davidson p. 277</ref>\n\nThe candidates scholars like to associate with the \"historical Ragnar\" include:\n* the ''Reginherus'' or ''Ragnar'' who [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieged Paris]] in 845\n* the Danish King [[Horik I]] (d. 854)\n* King [[Reginfrid]] (d. 814), a king who ruled part of Denmark in tandem with his brother [[Harald Klak]], but was expelled by Horik I and his brothers and later fell in a battle against them\n* possibly the [[Rognvald Eysteinsson|Ragnall]] (Ragnvald or Ragnar) of the [[Irish Annals]]{{sfn|Davidson|1980|p=277}}\n\nAttempts to reliably associate the legendary Ragnar with one or several of those men have failed because of the difficulty in reconciling the various accounts and their chronology. But the tradition of a Viking hero named Ragnar (or similar) who wreaked havoc in mid-[[9th-century]] Europe and who fathered many famous sons is remarkably persistent, and some aspects of it are strengthened by relatively reliable sources, such as Irish historical tradition and, indirectly, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.<ref>Smyth (1977).</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n{{in popular culture|date=January 2020}}\nRagnar Lodbrok features prominently in the following works:\n* [[Edwin Atherstone]]'s 1830 novel ''Sea-Kings in England''.\n* [[Edison Marshall]]'s 1951 novel ''The Viking''.<ref>Historical Novels.info [http://www.historicalnovels.info/Viking.html]</ref>\n* \"[[:fr:Ragnar le Viking|Ragnar le Viking]]\", a 1955 comic book feature written by Jean Ollivier with art by Eduardo Teixeira Coelho, that ran in the French ''[[Pif Gadget|Vaillant]]'' magazine up to 1969.<ref>BD oubli\u00e9es [https://www.bdoubliees.com/vaillantpif/series5/ragnar.htm]</ref>\n* Richard Parker's 1957 historical novel ''The Sword of [[Ganelon]]'' explores the character of Ragnar, his sons, and Viking raiding culture.<ref>Kirkus Review [https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/richard-parker-4/the-sword-of-ganelon/]</ref>\n* The 1958 film ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'' based on Marshall's novel, in which Ragnar, played by [[Ernest Borgnine]], is captured by King \u00c6lla and cast into a pit of wolves; a son named Einar {{sic}}, played by [[Kirk Douglas]], vows revenge and conquers [[Northumbria]] with help from half-brother (and sworn enemy) Eric (played by [[Tony Curtis]]), who also had much to avenge upon King Aella.\n* [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s 1993 alternative history novel ''[[The Hammer and the Cross]]'' depicts Ragnar being shipwrecked, captured and executed, as well as his sons' revenge.<ref>Publisher's Weekly, review [https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-85439-3]</ref>\n* [[History (Canadian TV network)|History]]'s popular 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]''.

Nearly all of the sagas agree that the [[Denmark|Danish]] king [[Randver]] was Sigurd's father, with the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' citing his wife as \u00c5sa, the daughter of King [[Harald Granraude|Harald of the Red Moustache]] from Norway. The accounts further tell that Randver was a grandson of the legendary Scandinavian king [[Ivar Vidfamne]] by his daughter Aud (whom the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' calls Alfhild).<ref>Tolkien, Christopher, & Turville-Petre, G. (eds) (1956) ''Hervarar Saga ok Heidreks''. London: Viking Society for Northern Research, p. 68-9.

Harald's nephew [[Sigurd Ring]] became the chief king of Sweden after Randver's death (Denmark according to ''Hervarar saga''), presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd and Harald fought the Battle of the Br\u00e1vellir ([[Br\u00e5valla]]) on the plains of [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]], where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd then ruled Sweden and Denmark (being sometimes identified with a Danish king [[Sigfred]] who ruled from about 770 until his death prior to 804). He sired a son with the Norwegian princess Alfhild of the semi-mythical \u00c1lfar people, Ragnar Lodbrok, who succeeded him.<ref>''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 10 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm]</ref> [[Eysteinn Beli]], who according to the ''[[Hervarar Saga]]'' was Harald Wartooth's son, ruled Sweden sometime after Sigurd until he was slain by the sons of Ragnar and [[Aslaug]].<ref>''The Tale of Ragnar's Sons'', Chapter 2 [http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/ThattrRagnarsSonar.html]</ref> \n\nIn their accounts of his reign, the Sagas of Icelandic Prehistory, known as [[fornaldarsaga]]<ref>http://fasnl.ku.dk/</ref> <ref>''fornaldars\u00f6gur'', chapter 25, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312033326_Sagas_of_Icelandic_Prehistory_fornaldarsogur]</ref> tell more about Ragnar's marriages than about feats of warfare. According to the ''[[Sogubrot|S\u00f6gubrot]]'', \"he was the biggest and fairest of men that human eyes have seen, and he was like his mother in appearance and took after her kin\".<ref>''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 10 [[https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm]</ref> He first killed a giant snake that guarded the abode of the [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland|East Geatic]] jarl's daughter [[Thora Borgarhjort]], thereby winning her as his wife. The unusual protective clothes that Ragnar wore, when attacking the serpent, earned him the nickname Lodbrok (\"shaggy breeches\"). His sons with Thora were [[Erik Weatherhat|Erik]] and Agnar. After Thora died, he discovered [[Aslaug|Kr\u00e1ka]], a woman of outstanding beauty and wisdom living with a poor peasant couple in [[Norway]], and married her. This marriage resulted in the sons [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]], [[Hvitserk]], Ragnvald and [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]].<ref>''Ragnars Saga Lodbrokar'', Chapters 4 and 7 [https://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/ragnar.htm]</ref> Kr\u00e1ka was later revealed to actually be [[Aslaug]], a secret daughter of the renowned hero [[Sigurd|Sigurd Fafnesbane]]. As the sons grew up to become renowned warriors, Ragnar, not wishing to be outdone, resolved to conquer [[England]] with merely two ships. He was however defeated by superior English forces and was thrown into a snake pit to die in agony.<ref>''Ragnars Saga Lodbrokar'', Chapter 15 [https://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/ragnar.htm]</ref> The ''[[Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok]]'', ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons]]'', and ''[[Heimskringla]]'' all tell of the [[Great Heathen Army]] that invaded England at around 866, led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok to wreak revenge against King [[\u00c6lla of Northumbria]] who is told to have captured and executed Ragnar.\n\n=== Danish sources ===\nThe ''[[Chronicon Roskildense]]'' (c. 1138) mentions Lodbrok (Lothpardus) as father to the utterly cruel Norse King Ywar (rex crudelissimus Normannorum Ywar) and his brothers, Inguar (a double of Ywar), Ubbi, Byorn and Ulf, who rule the northern peoples. They call on the various Danish petty kings to help them ruin the realm of the [[Franks]]. Ywar successfully attacks the kingdoms of [[Great Britain|Britain]], though not as an act of revenge as in the Icelandic sagas.<ref>''Chronicon Roskildense'', p. 16[https://archive.org/stream/scriptoresminore112gert#page/16/mode/2up]</ref> The chronicle of [[Sven Aggesen]] (c. 1190) is the first Danish text that mentions the full name, Regnerus Lothbrogh. His son Sigurd invades Denmark and kills its king, whose daughter he marries as he takes over the throne. Their son in turn is [[Hardeknud I|Knut]], ancestor of the later Danish kings.<ref>Sven Aggeson, p. 106[https://archive.org/stream/scriptoresminore112gert#page/106/mode/2up]</ref> \n\nNeither of these sources mentions Ragnar Lodbrok as a Danish ruler. The first to do so is [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (c. 1200). This work mixes Norse legend with data about Danish history derived from the chronicle of [[Adam of Bremen]] (c. 1075).<ref>Storm (1877), p. 387-9 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=399] </ref> Here Ragnar's father Sigurd Ring is a Norwegian prince married to a Danish princess, and different from the victor of Br\u00e1vellir (who had flourished about thirteen generations earlier). Sigurd Ring and his cousin and rival Ring (that is, [[Sigfred (Danish king 812)|Sigfred]] and [[Anulo]] of recorded history, d. 812) are both killed in battle, whereupon Ragnar is elevated to the Danish kingship (identified by Saxo with [[Reginfrid|Ragnfred]], d. 814<ref>Storm (1877), p. 399 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=411]</ref>).<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 539-41 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/541]</ref>  His first deed is the defeat of the Swedish king Fr\u00f6, who has killed Ragnar's grandfather. Ragnar is assisted in this by the ferocious shield-maiden [[Ladgerda]], whom he forces to marry him. In this marriage he sires the son Fridleif and two daughters.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 542-3 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/543]</ref>  He later repudiates the unreliable Ladgerda and instead wins the daughter of the Swedish king [[Herrau\u00f0r]], [[Thora Borgarhjort|Thora]], after killing two venomous giant snakes that guard her residence. His sons with Thora are Radbard, Dunvat, [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]], Agnar and [[Ivar the Boneless]]. From a non-marital affair with the daughter of one Esbj\u00f8rn, Ragnar begets [[Ubba|Ubbe]], while his last marriage with Svanlaug produces another three sons, Ragnvald, [[Eric Weatherhat]] and [[Hvitserk]].<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 545, 550 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/550]</ref> \n\nThe sons were installed as sub-kings in various conquered territories. Ragnar led a Viking expedition to England and slew its king Hama, proceeding to kill the earls of [[Scotland]] and install Sigurd Snake-in-the Eye and Radbard as governors. Norway was also subjugated, and Fridleif was made ruler there and in [[Orkney]]. Later on, Ragnar with three sons invaded Sweden where a new king called S\u00f6rle had appeared and withheld the heritage of Thora's sons. S\u00f6rle and his army were massacred and Bj\u00f6rn Ironside was installed on the throne.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 551 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/551]</ref>  Some time later Bj\u00f6rn was put in charge of Norway, while Ragnar appointed another son, Eric Weatherhat, as ruler in Sweden; he was subsequently killed by a certain [[Eysteinn Beli|Eysteinn]]. One of the sons, Ubbe, revolted against his father at the instigation of his maternal grandfather Esbj\u00f8rn, and could only be defeated and captured with utmost effort.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 557 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/557]</ref> Saxo moreover tells of repeated expeditions to the [[British Isles]], one of which cost the lives of Dunvat and Radbard. \u00c6lla, son of Hama, expelled Ragnar's sub-ruler Ivar the Boneless from England with the help of the Galli (Gaill, Hiberno-Norse?<ref>Smyth (1977).</ref>) and remained a persistent enemy.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 560-1 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/560]</ref> Finally, the [[Scythians]] were forced to accept Hvitserk as their ruler. In the end Hvitserk was treacherously captured by the [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontian]] prince Daxon and burnt alive with his own admission. Hearing this, Ragnar led an expedition to [[Kievan Rus']] and captured Daxon who was curiously spared and exiled.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 558-9 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/558]</ref> \n\nUnlike the Icelandic sources, Saxo's account of Ragnar Lodbrok's reign is largely a catalog of successful Viking invasions over an enormous geographical area. Among the seaborne expeditions was one against the [[Bjarmians]] and [[Finns]] ([[Sami people|Saami]]) in the Arctic north. The Bjarmian use of magic spells caused foul weather and the sudden death of many Danish invaders, and the Finnish archers on skis turned out to be a formidable foe. Eventually these two tribes were put to flight and the Bjarmian king was slain.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 558-9 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/554]</ref> The historical king [[Harald Klak]] is by Saxo (based on a passage in Adam's chronicle) made into another persistent enemy of Ragnar, who several times incited the [[Jutes]] and [[Sk\u00e5ne|Scanians]] to rebel, but was regularly defeated. After the last victory over Harald, Ragnar learned that King \u00c6lla had massacred Ragnar's men on [[Ireland]]. Incensed, he attacked the English king with his fleet but was captured and thrown into the snake pit, similar to the Icelandic sagas. In spite of all his praise for Ragnar Lodbrok, Saxo also considers his fate as God's rightful vengeance for the contempt he had shown the Christian religion.<ref>Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9, p. 562-3 [https://archive.org/details/ninebooksofdanis02saxouoft/page/563]</ref>\n\n=== Poetic and epigraphic sources ===\nWhile the narrative Norse sources date from the 12th and 13th centuries, there are also many older poems that mention him and his kin. The ''[[Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa]]'', ostensibly composed by [[Bragi Boddason]] in the 9th century, praises a Ragnar, son of Sigurd, for a richly decorated shield that the poet has received. The shield depicts the assault on [[Ermanaric|J\u00f6rmunrek]], the [[Hja\u00f0ningav\u00edg]] tale, the ploughing of [[Gefjon]], and [[Thor]]'s struggle with the [[Midgard Serpent]]. Recent scholarship has suggested that the poem is in fact from c. 1000 and celebrates the Norse reconquest of England. The four tales depicted on the shield would then symbolize four aspects of the Lodbrok saga (the initial defeat of the sons of Lodbrok in England due to recklessness, Ivar the Boneless's deceitful approach to King \u00c6lla, Ivar's cunning snatching of land from \u00c6lla, Ragnar's struggle against the giant serpent in order to win Thora).<ref>\"Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa\", ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 24, p. 115.</ref> The ''Knutsdrapa'' of [[Sigvat Thordarson]] (c. 1038) mentions the death of \u00c6lla at the hands of Ivar in [[York]], who \"carved the eagle on \u00c6lla's back\".<ref>Smyth (1977), p. 193-4.</ref> From this the story of the atrocious revenge of Lodbrok's sons already seems to be present. The reference to a \"[[blood eagle]]\" punishment has however been much debated by modern scholars.<ref>[[Rory McTurk]], \"Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria\", [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171200/http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm]</ref> Another lay, ''[[Krakumal]]'', put in the mouth of the dying Ragnar in the snake pit, recounts the exploits of Ragnar and mentions battles over a wide geographical area, several relating to the British isles. The poem's name, \"Kr\u00e1ka's lay\", alludes to Ragnar's wife's [[Aslaug|Kr\u00e1ka]],<ref>\"Kr\u00e1kum\u00e1l\", ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 17 (2001), p. 299-300.</ref> though modern philologists commonly date it to the 12th century in its present form.<ref>Smyth (1977), p. 73-80.</ref> \n\nThere is one runic inscription mentioning Lodbrok, carved on the prehistorical tumulus of [[Maeshowe]] on [[Orkney]] in the early 12th century. It reads: \"This howe was built a long time before Lodbrok's. Her sons, they were bold; scarcely ever were there such tall men of their hands\".<ref>Smyth (1977), p. 81.</ref> The expression \"her sons\" has given rise to the theory that Lodbrok was originally thought of as a woman,<ref>Gustav Storm (1877), \"Ragnar Lodbrok og Lodbrokss\u00f8nnerne; studie i dansk oldhistorie og nordisk sagnhistorie\", ''Historisk Tidskrift'' II:1 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639;view=1up;seq=419]</ref> mother of the historically known sons.<ref>[[Rory McTurk]], \"Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria\", [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171200/http://www.dur.ac.uk/medieval.www/sagaconf/mcturk.htm]; </ref>\n\n=== Frankish accounts of a 9th-century Viking leader named Ragnar ===\nThe [[Siege of Paris (845)|Siege of Paris]] and the Sack of Paris of 845 was the culmination of a Viking invasion of the kingdom of the [[West Francia|West Franks]]. The Viking forces were led by a Norse chieftain named \"Reginherus\", or Ragnar.{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}}  This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok,<ref>''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde'', Vol. 24, p. 111, 113, 116.</ref> but the accuracy of this is disputed by historians.{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}}{{Sfn | Sprague | 2007 | p = 225}} Ragnar Lodbrok is also sometimes identified with a Ragnar who was awarded land in [[Torhout]], [[Flanders]], by [[Charles the Bald]] in about 841 but eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the King.{{Sfn | Sawyer | 2001 | p = 40}}  Ragnar's Vikings raided [[Rouen]] on their way up the Seine in 845  and in response to the invasion, determined not to let the royal [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]] (near Paris) be destroyed, Charles assembled an army which he divided into two parts, one for each side of the river.{{Sfn | Duckett | 1988 | p = 181}}{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 |  p = 212}} Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army, took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine to honour the [[Norse religion|Norse god]] [[Odin]], as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces.{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}}{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}} Ragnar's fleet made it back to his overlord, the Danish King [[Horik I]], but Ragnar soon died from a violent illness that also spread in Denmark.<ref>Storm (1877), p. 438 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044105191639&view=1up&seq=450]</ref>\n\n=== Later continental accounts ===\nAmong the oldest texts to mention the name Lodbrok is the Norman history of [[William of Jumi\u00e8ges]] from c. 1070. According to William, the Danish kings of old had the custom to expel the younger sons from the kingdom to have them out of the way. At a time it happened that King [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Lodbrok]] succeeded his unnamed father on the Danish throne. After gaining power he honoured the said custom and ordered his junior son [[Bj\u00f6rn Ironside]] to leave his realm. Bj\u00f6rn thus left Denmark with a considerable fleet and started to ravage in [[West Francia]] and later the [[Mediterranean]].<ref>Guillaume de Jumi\u00e8ges, ''Histoire des ducs de Normandie'', p. 11-3 [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013753564;view=1up;seq=23]</ref> Roughly contemporary with William is [[Adam of Bremen]] whose history of the [[Archbishopric of Hamburg|Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]] contains many traditions about Viking Age Scandinavia. In a passage referring to the Viking raids of the late 9th century, he mentions the Danish or Norse pirates Horich, Orwig, Gotafrid, Rudolf and Inguar (Ivar). This Ivar is in particular seen as a cruel persecutor of Christians, and a son of Lodbrok (Inguar, filius Lodparchi).<ref>Adam von Bremen, ''Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte'', p. 39-40[https://archive.org/stream/adamvonbremenham00adam#page/40/mode/2up]</ref>\n\n=== Anglo-Saxon and Irish accounts of the father of Ivar and Halfdan ===\nAccording to the contemporary ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and [[Asser]]'s ''Life of Alfred'', in 878 the \"brother of Hingwar and Healfden\", with a naval fleet, a contingent of the [[Great Heathen Army]] invaded [[Devon]] in England and fought the [[Battle of Cynwit]]. There the Vikings lost, their king slain and many dead, with few escaping to their ships. After the battle the [[Saxons]] took great plunder, and among other things the banner called \"Raven\".<ref>Garmonsway, G.N. (1972), ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. London: Dent, p. 75-7.</ref> The early 12th century ''[[Annals of St Neots]]'' further state that ''\"they say that the three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, daughters of Lodebroch (Lodbrok), wove that flag and got it ready in one day. They say, moreover, that in every battle, wherever the flag went before them, if they were to gain the victory a live crow would appear flying on the middle of the flag; but if they were doomed to be defeated it would hang down motionless, and this was often proved to be so.\"''<ref>Garmonsway, G.N. (1972), ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. London: Dent, p. 77.</ref>\nThis is among the earlier references to the legendary hero Ragnar Lodbrok.\n\nThe Irish ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'' from the 12th century, with information deriving from earlier annals, mentions king Halfdan (d. 877) under the name \"mac Ragnaill\".<ref>James Todd (1867), ''Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh'', London: Longman, p. 27 [https://archive.org/details/cogadhgaedhelreg00todd/page/26/mode/2up]</ref> The form Ragnall may refer to either Ragnvald or Ragnar, and the entry is a strong indication that the name of Ivar's and Halfdan's father was really Ragnar or a similar name.<ref>Smyth, Alfred P. (1977) ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 263, 279.</ref> The early 11th century ''[[Three Fragments]]'' contains a passage that gives a semi-legendary background to the capture of York by the Vikings in 866. The two younger sons of Halfdan, King of [[Lochlann]], expelled the eldest son Ragnall who sailed to the [[Orkney islands]] with his three sons and settled there. Two of the sons later raided the English and [[Franks]], proceeding to plunder in the Mediterranean. One of them learnt from a vision that Ragnall had fought a battle where the third son had been slain and in which he himself had most likely perished. The two Viking sons then returned home with a lot of dark-skinned captives.<ref>Smyth, Alfred P. (1977) ''Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 62.</ref> It has been hypothesized that this is an Irish version of ''[[Ragnar Lodbrok's saga]]'', the Mediterranean expedition being a historical event taking place in 859-61.<ref>Smyth, Alfred P.

Modern academia regards most of the stories about him to be fiction. According to [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]], writing in 1979,\n\n<blockquote>Certain scholars in recent years have come to accept at least part of Ragnar's story as based on historical fact.<ref>Davidson p. 277</ref></blockquote> A generation later, however, Katherine Holman wrote in 2003: <blockquote>Although his sons are historical figures, there is no evidence that Ragnar himself ever lived and he seems to be an amalgam of historical figures and literary invention.<ref name=\"Z\">Holman 2003 p. 220</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe most significant medieval sources that mention Ragnar include:\n* Book IX of the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', a 12th-century work by the Christian Danish chronicler [[Saxo Grammaticus]]\n* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|Tale of Ragnar's sons]]'' (''Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr''), a [[legendary saga]]\n* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar Lothbrok ]]'', another saga, a sequel to the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]''\n* the ''[[Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa]]'', a [[skaldic poem]] of which only fragments remain, attributed to the 9th-century poet [[Bragi Boddason]]\n* the ''[[Kr\u00e1kum\u00e1l]]'', Ragnar's death-song, an old and mysterious skaldic poem\n\nIn her commentary on Saxo's ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', Davidson notes that Saxo's coverage of Ragnar's legend in book IX of the ''Gesta'' appears to be an attempt to consolidate many of the confusing and contradictory events and stories known to the chronicler into the reign of one king, Ragnar. That is why many acts ascribed to Ragnar in the ''Gesta'' can be associated, through other sources, with various figures, some of whom are more historically tenable.<ref>Davidson p. 277</ref>\n\nThe candidates scholars like to associate with the \"historical Ragnar\" include:\n* the ''Reginherus'' or ''Ragnar'' who [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieged Paris]] in 845\n* the Danish King [[Horik I]] (d. 854)\n* King [[Reginfrid]] (d. 814), a king who ruled part of Denmark in tandem with his brother [[Harald Klak]], but was expelled by Horik I and his brothers and later fell in a battle against them\n* possibly the [[Rognvald Eysteinsson|Ragnall]] (Ragnvald or Ragnar) of the [[Irish Annals]]{{sfn|Davidson|1980|p=277}}\n\nAttempts to reliably associate the legendary Ragnar with one or several of those men have failed because of the difficulty in reconciling the various accounts and their chronology. But the tradition of a Viking hero named Ragnar (or similar) who wreaked havoc in mid-[[9th-century]] Europe and who fathered many famous sons is remarkably persistent, and some aspects of it are strengthened by relatively reliable sources, such as Irish historical tradition and, indirectly, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.<ref>Smyth (1977).</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n{{in popular culture|date=January 2020}}\nRagnar Lodbrok features prominently in the following works:\n* [[Edwin Atherstone]]'s 1830 novel ''Sea-Kings in England''.\n* [[Edison Marshall]]'s 1951 novel ''The Viking''.<ref>Historical Novels.info [http://www.historicalnovels.info/Viking.html]</ref>\n* \"[[:fr:Ragnar le Viking|Ragnar le Viking]]\", a 1955 comic book feature written by Jean Ollivier with art by Eduardo Teixeira Coelho, that ran in the French ''[[Pif Gadget|Vaillant]]'' magazine up to 1969.<ref>BD oubli\u00e9es [https://www.bdoubliees.com/vaillantpif/series5/ragnar.htm]</ref>\n* Richard Parker's 1957 historical novel ''The Sword of [[Ganelon]]'' explores the character of Ragnar, his sons, and Viking raiding culture.<ref>Kirkus Review [https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/richard-parker-4/the-sword-of-ganelon/]</ref>\n* The 1958 film ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'' based on Marshall's novel, in which Ragnar, played by [[Ernest Borgnine]], is captured by King \u00c6lla and cast into a pit of wolves; a son named Einar {{sic}}, played by [[Kirk Douglas]], vows revenge and conquers [[Northumbria]] with help from half-brother (and sworn enemy) Eric (played by [[Tony Curtis]]), who also had much to avenge upon King Aella.\n* [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s 1993 alternative history novel ''[[The Hammer and the Cross]]'' depicts Ragnar being shipwrecked, captured and executed, as well as his sons' revenge.<ref>Publisher's Weekly, review [https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-85439-3]</ref>\n* [[History (Canadian TV network)|History]]'s popular 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]''.

It is the administrative headquarters of [[Salcete]] [[Tehsils of India|sub-district]] and [[South Goa district|South Goa]] district.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Marg\u00e3o'' is the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] spelling, with ''Madgao'' being used in [[Konkani language|Konkani]]. It was called ''Madgaon'' in Marathi. It is derived from the [[Sanskrit]]  {{lang|sa|\u092e\u0920\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e}} (''Ma\u1e6dhagr\u0101ma'') which means a village of monasteries.\n\nIn ''Ravanphond'', now a suburb of Margao, there are shrines of [[Matsyendranath]] and [[Gorakhnath]].<ref name=\"satos\">{{cite book|last1=Satoskar|first1=B.D|title=Gomantak: prak\u1e5bit\u012b \u0101\u1e47i sa\u1e43sk\u1e5bit\u012b|date=1979|publisher=\u015aubhd\u0101-S\u0101rasvat|page=113}}</ref> The abode of [[Nath]] medicants was called a ''Matha'' (Monastery).

Its replacement in 1579 was destroyed by raiders. The present church was built in 1675.<ref>\"Hindu temples and deities\" by Rui Gomes Pereira</ref><ref>\"Gomantak Prakruti ani Sanskruti\" by B.D.Satoskar</ref>\n\n===Damodar Temple===\n\nThe initial settlement of Marg\u00e3o grew from the site of the ancient Damodar Temple. The original temple was demolished and the temple [[Irrigation tank|tank]] was filled up to be replaced by the Holy Spirit church and church grounds{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. The deity [[Damodar (name of Krishna)|Damodar]] (a form of Lord Vishnu) was carried across the [[Zuari]] Agranashini river to the Novas Conquistas in which the Sonde rulers resided.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} While the western side of the Holy Spirit Church developed as a market place, the settlement grew on the eastern side, that is, the Borda region, with the Holy Spirit Church, Margao at its core and extended outwards.\n\n===Camara Municipal de Salcete===\nThe Municipality during the erstwhile Portuguese regime was known as \"C\u00e2mara Municipal de Salcete\",<ref name=\" Camara Municipal de Salcete\">[http://www.mmcmargao.gov.in/aboutUs.aspx]</ref> catering to all the villages in Salcete Taluka for over 300 years until the Goa Municipalities Act of 1968 came into force.

Some instances of exploring these \"nearby\" nodes require traversing up to {{math|''h'' &prop; log(''n'')}} links (particularly when navigating from the rightmost leaf of the root's left subtree to the root or from the root to the leftmost leaf of the root's right subtree; in the AVL tree of figure 1, moving from node P to the ''next but one'' node Q takes 3 steps). However, exploring all {{math|''n''}} nodes of the tree in this manner would visit each link exactly twice: one downward visit to enter the subtree rooted by that node, another visit upward to leave that node's subtree after having explored it. And since there are {{math|''n''\u22121}} links in any tree, the amortized cost is {{math|2\u00d7(''n''\u22121)/''n''}}, or approximately 2.\n\n===Insert===\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Expand section|date=November 2016|small=no}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\n}}\nWhen inserting an element into an AVL tree, you initially follow the same process as inserting into a [[Binary Search Tree]].  More explicitly: In case a preceding search has not been successful the search routine returns the tree itself with indication EMPTY and the new node is inserted as root. Or, if the tree has not been empty the search routine returns a node and a direction (left or right) where the returned node does not have a child.

Then fast ''bulk'' operations on insertions or deletions can be implemented based on these set functions. These set operations rely on two helper operations, ''Split'' and ''Join''. With the new operations, the implementation of AVL trees can be more efficient and highly-parallelizable.<ref name=\"join-based\">{{citation\n | last1 = Blelloch | first1 = Guy E.\n | last2 = Ferizovic | first2 = Daniel\n | last3 = Sun | first3 = Yihan\n | chapter = Just join for parallel ordered sets\n | doi = 10.1145/2935764.2935768\n | isbn = 978-1-4503-4210-0\n | pages = 253\u2013264\n | publisher = ACM\n | title = Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures\n | year = 2016| arxiv = 1602.02120\n }}.</ref>\n\n*''Join'': The function ''Join'' is on two AVL trees {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} and a key {{mvar|k}} will return a tree containing all elements in {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} as well as {{mvar|k}}. It requires {{mvar|k}} to be greater than all keys in {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} and smaller than all keys in {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}}. If the two trees differ by height at most one, ''Join'' simply create a new node with left subtree {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}}, root {{mvar|k}} and right subtree {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}}. Otherwise, suppose that {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} is higher than {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} for more than one (the other case is symmetric). ''Join'' follows the right spine of {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} until a node {{mvar|c}} which is balanced with {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}}. At this point a new node with left child {{mvar|c}}, root {{mvar| k}} and right child {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} is created to replace c. The new node satisfies the AVL invariant, and its height is one greater than {{mvar|c}}. The increase in height can increase the height of its ancestors, possibly invalidating the AVL invariant of those nodes. This can be fixed either with a double rotation if invalid at the parent or a single left rotation if invalid higher in the tree, in both cases restoring the height for any further ancestor nodes. ''Join'' will therefore require at most two rotations. The cost of this function is the difference of the heights between the two input trees.\n{{Collapse top|Pseudocode implementation for the join algorithm}}\n '''function''' joinRightAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     (l,k',c)=expose(T<sub>L</sub>)\n     '''if''' (h(c)<=h(T<sub>R</sub>)+1)\n        T'=Node(c,k,T<sub>R</sub>)\n        if (h(T')<=h(l)+1) then '''return''' Node(l,k',T')\n        else '''return''' rotateLeft(Node(l,k'rotateRight(T')))\n     '''else''' \n         T'=joinRightAVL(c,k,T<sub>R</sub>)\n         T''=Node(l,k',T')\n         '''if''' (h(T')<=h(l)+1) '''return''' T''\n         '''else''' '''return''' rotateLeft(T'')\n '''function''' joinLeftAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n   /* symmetric to joinRightAVL */\n '''function''' join(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     '''if''' (h(T<sub>L</sub>)>h(T<sub>R</sub>)+1) '''return''' joinRightAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     '''if''' (h(T<sub>R</sub>)>h(T<sub>L</sub>)+1) '''return''' joinLeftAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     '''return''' Node(T<sub>L</sub>,k,T<sub>R</sub>)\n     \nHere <math>h(v)</math> of a node <math>v</math> the height of <math>v</math>. expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node <math>v</math>'s left child <math>l</math>, the key of the node <math>k</math>, and the right child <math>r</math>.

Based on the new functions for union, intersection or difference, either one key or multiple keys can be inserted to or deleted from the AVL tree.

The given repair tools are the so-called [[tree rotation]]s, because they move the keys only \"vertically\", so that the (\"horizontal\") in-order sequence of the keys is fully preserved (which is essential for a binary-search tree).<ref name=\"Sorting and searching\"/><ref name=\"Free Software Foundation, Inc\"/>\n\nLet X be the node that has a (temporary) balance factor of \u22122 or +2. Its left or right subtree was modified. Let Z be the higher child. Note that Z is in AVL shape by [[Mathematical induction|induction hypothesis]].\n\nIn case of insertion this insertion has happened to one of Z's children in a way that Z's height has increased.\nIn case of deletion this deletion has happened to the sibling t<sub>1</sub> of Z in a way so that t<sub>1</sub>'s height being already lower has decreased. (In that case Z's balance factor may be 0.)\n\nThere are four situations that might arise. We will describe them as '''Dir1 Dir2''', where '''Dir1''' comes from the set { ''left'', ''right'' } and '''Dir2''' as a balance factor comes from the set { ''left-heavy'' = \u22121, ''balanced'' = 0, ''right-heavy'' = +1 }.<ref>Thereby, rotations with case ''Balanced'' do not occur with insertions.</ref>\n\nSituation Dir1 Dir2 denotes:\n:'''Z is a Dir1 child of its parent and'''\n:: '''Z is Dir2-heavy if Dir2 != Dir1 '''\n:: '''Z is not (\u2212Dir2)-heavy if Dir2 == Dir1 '''\ni.e.\n{| \n|-\n| style=\"width:1em\" | || Right Right || => Z is a ''right'' || child of its parent X and Z is not ''left-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) \u2265 0) || (see figure 4)\n|-\n| || Left Left || => Z is a ''left'' || child of its parent X and Z is not ''right-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) \u2264 0)\n|-\n| || Right Left || => Z is a ''right'' || child of its parent X and Z is ''left-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) = \u22121) || (see figure 5)\n|-\n| || Left Right || => Z is a ''left'' || child of its parent X and Z is ''right-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) = +1)\n|}\n\nThe balance violation of case Dir1 == Dir2 is repaired by a simple rotation rotate_(\u2212Dir1) (<tt>rotate_Left</tt> in figure 4 resp. its mirror <tt>rotate_Right</tt>).\n\nThe case Dir1 != Dir2 is repaired by a double rotation rotate_(\u2212Dir2)(\u2212Dir1) == rotate_Dir1Dir2 (<tt>rotate_RightLeft</tt> in figure 5 resp. its mirror <tt>rotate_LeftRight</tt>).\n\nThe cost of a rotation, both simple and double, is constant.\n\n===Simple rotation===\nFigure 4 shows a Right Right situation. In its upper half, node X has two child trees with a balance factor of <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\">+2</span>. Moreover, the inner child t<sub>23</sub> of Z (i.e., left child when Z is right child resp. right child when Z is left child) is not higher than its sibling t<sub>4</sub>. This can happen by a height increase of subtree t<sub>4</sub> or by a height decrease of subtree t<sub>1</sub>. In the latter case, also the pale situation where t<sub>23</sub> has the same height as t<sub>4</sub> may occur.\n\nThe result of the left rotation is shown in the lower half of the figure. Three links (thick edges in figure 4) and two balance factors are to be updated.\n\nAs the figure shows, before an insertion, the leaf layer was at level h+1, temporarily at level h+2 and after the rotation again at level h+1. In case of a deletion, the leaf layer was at level h+2, where it is again, when t<sub>23</sub> and t<sub>4</sub> were of same height. Otherwise the leaf layer reaches level h+1, so that the height of the rotated tree decreases.\n\n[[File:AVL-simple-left_K.svg|thumb|right|194px|Fig. 4: Simple rotation<br />''rotate_Left''(''X'',''Z'')]]\n;Code snippet of a simple left rotation\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:4em;\" | Input: || X = root of subtree to be rotated left\n|-\n| || Z = right child of X, Z is right-heavy\n|-\n| || &nbsp; &nbsp; with height == {{math|Height(LeftSubtree(}}X{{math|))+2}}\n|-\n|Result: || new root of rebalanced subtree\n|}\n<source lang=\"c\" style=\"overflow:hidden\" line=\"1\">\nnode *rotate_Left(node *X, node *Z) {\n    // Z is by 2 higher than its sibling\n    t23 = left_child(Z); // Inner child of Z\n    right_child(X) = t23;\n    if (t23 != null)\n        parent(t23) = X;\n    left_child(Z) = X;\n    parent(X) = Z;\n    // 1st case, BalanceFactor(Z) == 0, only happens with deletion, not insertion:\n    if (BalanceFactor(Z) == 0) { // t23 has been of same height as t4\n        BalanceFactor(X) = +1;   // t23 now higher\n        BalanceFactor(Z) = \u20131;   // t4 now lower than X\n    } else { // 2nd case happens with insertion or deletion:\n        BalanceFactor(X) = 0;\n        BalanceFactor(Z) = 0;\n    }\n    return Z; // return new root of rotated subtree\n}\n</source>\n\n===Double rotation===\nFigure 5 shows a Right Left situation.

This can happen by the insertion of Y itself or a height increase of one of its subtrees t<sub>2</sub> or t<sub>3</sub> (with the consequence that they are of different height) or by a height decrease of subtree t<sub>1</sub>.

However, exploring all {{math|''n''}} nodes of the tree in this manner would visit each link exactly twice: one downward visit to enter the subtree rooted by that node, another visit upward to leave that node's subtree after having explored it.

Then the node to be inserted is made child of the returned node at the returned direction.\n\nAfter this insertion it is necessary to check each of the node's ancestors for consistency with the invariants of AVL trees: this is called \"retracing\".

It depends on the balance factor of the sibling Z (the higher child tree in fig. 4) whether the height of the subtree decreases by one \u2013and the retracing needs to continue\u2013 or does not change (if Z has the balance factor 0) and the whole tree is in AVL-shape.\n\nThe time required is {{math|O(log ''n'')}} for lookup, plus a maximum of {{math|O(log ''n'')}} retracing levels ({{math|O(1)}} on average) on the way back to the root, so the operation can be completed in {{math|O(log ''n'')}} time.\n\n===Set operations and bulk operations===\nIn addition to the single-element insert, delete and lookup operations, several set operations have been defined on AVL trees: [[Union (set theory)|union]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[set difference]]. Then fast ''bulk'' operations on insertions or deletions can be implemented based on these set functions. These set operations rely on two helper operations, ''Split'' and ''Join''. With the new operations, the implementation of AVL trees can be more efficient and highly-parallelizable.<ref name=\"join-based\">{{citation\n | last1 = Blelloch | first1 = Guy E.\n | last2 = Ferizovic | first2 = Daniel\n | last3 = Sun | first3 = Yihan\n | chapter = Just join for parallel ordered sets\n | doi = 10.1145/2935764.2935768\n | isbn = 978-1-4503-4210-0\n | pages = 253\u2013264\n | publisher = ACM\n | title = Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures\n | year = 2016| arxiv = 1602.02120\n }}.</ref>\n\n*''Join'': The function ''Join'' is on two AVL trees {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} and a key {{mvar|k}} will return a tree containing all elements in {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} as well as {{mvar|k}}. It requires {{mvar|k}} to be greater than all keys in {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} and smaller than all keys in {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}}. If the two trees differ by height at most one, ''Join'' simply create a new node with left subtree {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}}, root {{mvar|k}} and right subtree {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}}. Otherwise, suppose that {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} is higher than {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} for more than one (the other case is symmetric). ''Join'' follows the right spine of {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} until a node {{mvar|c}} which is balanced with {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}}. At this point a new node with left child {{mvar|c}}, root {{mvar| k}} and right child {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}} is created to replace c. The new node satisfies the AVL invariant, and its height is one greater than {{mvar|c}}. The increase in height can increase the height of its ancestors, possibly invalidating the AVL invariant of those nodes. This can be fixed either with a double rotation if invalid at the parent or a single left rotation if invalid higher in the tree, in both cases restoring the height for any further ancestor nodes. ''Join'' will therefore require at most two rotations. The cost of this function is the difference of the heights between the two input trees.\n{{Collapse top|Pseudocode implementation for the join algorithm}}\n '''function''' joinRightAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     (l,k',c)=expose(T<sub>L</sub>)\n     '''if''' (h(c)<=h(T<sub>R</sub>)+1)\n        T'=Node(c,k,T<sub>R</sub>)\n        if (h(T')<=h(l)+1) then '''return''' Node(l,k',T')\n        else '''return''' rotateLeft(Node(l,k'rotateRight(T')))\n     '''else''' \n         T'=joinRightAVL(c,k,T<sub>R</sub>)\n         T''=Node(l,k',T')\n         '''if''' (h(T')<=h(l)+1) '''return''' T''\n         '''else''' '''return''' rotateLeft(T'')\n '''function''' joinLeftAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n   /* symmetric to joinRightAVL */\n '''function''' join(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     '''if''' (h(T<sub>L</sub>)>h(T<sub>R</sub>)+1) '''return''' joinRightAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     '''if''' (h(T<sub>R</sub>)>h(T<sub>L</sub>)+1) '''return''' joinLeftAVL(T<sub>L</sub>, k, T<sub>R</sub>)\n     '''return''' Node(T<sub>L</sub>,k,T<sub>R</sub>)\n     \nHere <math>h(v)</math> of a node <math>v</math> the height of <math>v</math>. expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node <math>v</math>'s left child <math>l</math>, the key of the node <math>k</math>, and the right child <math>r</math>.

After this insertion, all values less than ''x'' will be found on the left of the path, and all values greater than ''x'' will be found on the right. By applying ''Join'', all the subtrees on the left side are merged bottom-up using keys on the path as intermediate nodes from bottom to top to form the left tree, and the right part is asymmetric.

(The algorithm is [[persistent data structure|non-destructive]], but an in-place destructive version exists as well.)\n{{Collapse bottom}}\n\nThe algorithm for intersection or difference is similar, but requires the ''Join2'' helper routine that is the same as ''Join'' but without the middle key. Based on the new functions for union, intersection or difference, either one key or multiple keys can be inserted to or deleted from the AVL tree. Since ''Split'' calls ''Join'' but does not deal with the balancing criteria of AVL trees directly, such an implementation is usually called the [[Join-based tree algorithms|\"join-based\" implementation]].\n\nThe complexity of each of union, intersection and difference is <math>O\\left(m \\log \\left({n\\over m}+1\\right)\\right)</math> for AVLs of sizes <math>m</math> and <math>n(\\ge m)</math>.

The given repair tools are the so-called [[tree rotation]]s, because they move the keys only \"vertically\", so that the (\"horizontal\") in-order sequence of the keys is fully preserved (which is essential for a binary-search tree).<ref name=\"Sorting and searching\"/><ref name=\"Free Software Foundation, Inc\"/>\n\nLet X be the node that has a (temporary) balance factor of \u22122 or +2. Its left or right subtree was modified. Let Z be the higher child. Note that Z is in AVL shape by [[Mathematical induction|induction hypothesis]].\n\nIn case of insertion this insertion has happened to one of Z's children in a way that Z's height has increased.\nIn case of deletion this deletion has happened to the sibling t<sub>1</sub> of Z in a way so that t<sub>1</sub>'s height being already lower has decreased. (In that case Z's balance factor may be 0.)\n\nThere are four situations that might arise. We will describe them as '''Dir1 Dir2''', where '''Dir1''' comes from the set { ''left'', ''right'' } and '''Dir2''' as a balance factor comes from the set { ''left-heavy'' = \u22121, ''balanced'' = 0, ''right-heavy'' = +1 }.<ref>Thereby, rotations with case ''Balanced'' do not occur with insertions.</ref>\n\nSituation Dir1 Dir2 denotes:\n:'''Z is a Dir1 child of its parent and'''\n:: '''Z is Dir2-heavy if Dir2 != Dir1 '''\n:: '''Z is not (\u2212Dir2)-heavy if Dir2 == Dir1 '''\ni.e.\n{| \n|-\n| style=\"width:1em\" | || Right Right || => Z is a ''right'' || child of its parent X and Z is not ''left-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) \u2265 0) || (see figure 4)\n|-\n| || Left Left || => Z is a ''left'' || child of its parent X and Z is not ''right-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) \u2264 0)\n|-\n| || Right Left || => Z is a ''right'' || child of its parent X and Z is ''left-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) = \u22121) || (see figure 5)\n|-\n| || Left Right || => Z is a ''left'' || child of its parent X and Z is ''right-heavy'' || (i.e. BalanceFactor(Z) = +1)\n|}\n\nThe balance violation of case Dir1 == Dir2 is repaired by a simple rotation rotate_(\u2212Dir1) (<tt>rotate_Left</tt> in figure 4 resp. its mirror <tt>rotate_Right</tt>).\n\nThe case Dir1 != Dir2 is repaired by a double rotation rotate_(\u2212Dir2)(\u2212Dir1) == rotate_Dir1Dir2 (<tt>rotate_RightLeft</tt> in figure 5 resp. its mirror <tt>rotate_LeftRight</tt>).\n\nThe cost of a rotation, both simple and double, is constant.\n\n===Simple rotation===\nFigure 4 shows a Right Right situation. In its upper half, node X has two child trees with a balance factor of <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\">+2</span>. Moreover, the inner child t<sub>23</sub> of Z (i.e., left child when Z is right child resp. right child when Z is left child) is not higher than its sibling t<sub>4</sub>. This can happen by a height increase of subtree t<sub>4</sub> or by a height decrease of subtree t<sub>1</sub>. In the latter case, also the pale situation where t<sub>23</sub> has the same height as t<sub>4</sub> may occur.\n\nThe result of the left rotation is shown in the lower half of the figure. Three links (thick edges in figure 4) and two balance factors are to be updated.\n\nAs the figure shows, before an insertion, the leaf layer was at level h+1, temporarily at level h+2 and after the rotation again at level h+1. In case of a deletion, the leaf layer was at level h+2, where it is again, when t<sub>23</sub> and t<sub>4</sub> were of same height. Otherwise the leaf layer reaches level h+1, so that the height of the rotated tree decreases.\n\n[[File:AVL-simple-left_K.svg|thumb|right|194px|Fig. 4: Simple rotation<br />''rotate_Left''(''X'',''Z'')]]\n;Code snippet of a simple left rotation\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:4em;\" | Input: || X = root of subtree to be rotated left\n|-\n| || Z = right child of X, Z is right-heavy\n|-\n| || &nbsp; &nbsp; with height == {{math|Height(LeftSubtree(}}X{{math|))+2}}\n|-\n|Result: || new root of rebalanced subtree\n|}\n<source lang=\"c\" style=\"overflow:hidden\" line=\"1\">\nnode *rotate_Left(node *X, node *Z) {\n    // Z is by 2 higher than its sibling\n    t23 = left_child(Z); // Inner child of Z\n    right_child(X) = t23;\n    if (t23 != null)\n        parent(t23) = X;\n    left_child(Z) = X;\n    parent(X) = Z;\n    // 1st case, BalanceFactor(Z) == 0, only happens with deletion, not insertion:\n    if (BalanceFactor(Z) == 0) { // t23 has been of same height as t4\n        BalanceFactor(X) = +1;   // t23 now higher\n        BalanceFactor(Z) = \u20131;   // t4 now lower than X\n    } else { // 2nd case happens with insertion or deletion:\n        BalanceFactor(X) = 0;\n        BalanceFactor(Z) = 0;\n    }\n    return Z; // return new root of rotated subtree\n}\n</source>\n\n===Double rotation===\nFigure 5 shows a Right Left situation. In its upper third, node X has two child trees with a balance factor of <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\">+2</span>. But unlike figure 4, the inner child Y of Z is higher than its sibling t<sub>4</sub>. This can happen by the insertion of Y itself or a height increase of one of its subtrees t<sub>2</sub> or t<sub>3</sub> (with the consequence that they are of different height) or by a height decrease of subtree t<sub>1</sub>. In the latter case, it may also occur that t<sub>2</sub> and t<sub>3</sub> are of same height.\n\nThe result of the first, the right, rotation is shown in the middle third of the figure. (With respect to the balance factors, this rotation is not of the same kind as the other AVL single rotations, because the height difference between Y and t<sub>4</sub> is only 1.) The result of the final left rotation is shown in the lower third of the figure. Five links (thick edges in figure 5) and three balance factors are to be updated.\n\nAs the figure shows, before an insertion, the leaf layer was at level h+1, temporarily at level h+2 and after the double rotation again at level h+1.

In the worst case, even without rotations, AVL or RB insertions or deletions require {{math|O(log ''n'')}} inspections and/or updates to AVL balance factors resp. RB colors.
