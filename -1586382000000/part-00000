He moved to London in 1906, to become a clerk in the [[Post Office Savings Bank]] at [[Blythe House]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He was a member of the [[London GAA]], through which he became associated with the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] and the [[Gaelic League]]. He returned to Ireland in 1916 and fought in the [[Easter Rising]]. He was subsequently imprisoned in the [[Frongoch internment camp]] as a [[prisoner of war]], but was released in December 1916.\n\nCollins rose through the ranks of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] after his release from Frongoch. He became a [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] for [[South Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cork]] in [[1918 Irish general election|1918]], and was appointed [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] in the [[First D\u00e1il]]. He was present when the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il]] convened on 21 January 1919 and [[Irish Declaration of Independence|declared the independence]] of the [[Irish Republic]]. In the ensuing [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]], he was Director of Organisation and Adjutant General for the Irish Volunteers, and Director of Intelligence of the [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|Irish Republican Army]]. He gained fame as a [[guerrilla warfare]] strategist, planning and directing many successful attacks on British forces, such as the [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|\"Bloody Sunday\" assassinations]] of key British intelligence agents in November 1920.\n\nAfter the July 1921 ceasefire, Collins and [[Arthur Griffith]] were sent to London by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] to negotiate peace terms. The resulting [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] established the [[Irish Free State]] but depended on an [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] to [[the Crown]], a condition with which de Valera and other republican leaders had difficulty reconciling. Collins viewed the treaty as offering \"the freedom to achieve freedom\", and persuaded a majority in the [[Second D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il]] to ratify the treaty. A [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|provisional government]] was formed under his [[Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|chairmanship]] in early 1922 but was soon disrupted by the [[Irish Civil War]], in which Collins was [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]]. He was shot and killed in an ambush by anti-treaty forces on 22 August 1922.\n\n==Early years==\nCollins was born in [[Michael Collins Birthplace|Woodfield, Sam's Cross]], near [[Clonakilty]] [[County Cork]], on 16 October 1890,<ref name=birth>{{cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/images/birth_returns/births_1890/02404/1896440.pdf|title=16th October 1890 \u2013 Birth of Michael Collins|work=Civil Records on Irish Genealogy Site|accessdate=27 May 2017}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|name=n 1|His gravestone in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] erroneously gives his birth date as 12 October 1890.}} the third son and youngest of eight children.

Collins is fifth from the right with an 'x' over his head.]]\n\nThe struggle for [[Irish Home Rule movement|Home Rule]], along with labour unrest, had led to the formation in 1913 of two major nationalist paramilitary groups who later launched the [[Easter Rising]]: the [[Irish Citizen Army]] was established by [[James Connolly]], [[James Larkin]] and his [[Irish Transport and General Workers Union]] (ITGWU) to protect strikers from the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] during the [[1913 Dublin Lockout]]. The [[Irish Volunteers]] were created in the same year by nationalists in response to the formation of the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF), an [[Ulster loyalist]] body pledged to oppose Home Rule by force.\n\nAn organiser of considerable intelligence, Collins had become highly respected in the IRB. This led to his appointment as financial advisor to [[George Noble Plunkett|Count Plunkett]], father of one of the [[Easter Rising]]'s organisers, [[Joseph Plunkett]]. Collins took part in preparing arms and drilling troops for the insurrection.\n\nThe Rising was Collins' first appearance in national events. When it commenced on [[Easter Monday]] 1916, Collins served as Joseph Plunkett's aide-de-camp at the rebellion's headquarters in the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]] (GPO) in [[Dublin]]. There he fought alongside [[Patrick Pearse]], James Connolly, and other members of the Rising leadership. The Rising was put down after six days, but the insurgents achieved their goal of holding their positions for the minimum time required to justify a claim to independence under international criteria.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first= Kathleen|title=Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman|publisher=Dublin: O'Brien Press Ltd |year=2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Collins was arrested and taken into British custody. He was processed at Dublin's [[Richmond Barracks]] by \"[[G Division (Dublin Metropolitan Police)|G-Men]]\", plain-clothes officers from [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]]. During his screening, Collins was identified as someone who should be selected for further interrogation, harsher treatment, or execution. However, he overheard his name being called out so he moved to the other side of the building to identify the speaker. In doing so, he joined the group that was transferred to [[Frongoch internment camp]] in Wales, a movement that historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] describes as \"one of the luckiest escapes of his life.\"<ref name=\"TP\">{{cite book|authorlink=Tim Pat Coogan|first= Tim Pat|last=Coogan|title=Michael Collins: A Biography|page= 50|publisher=Arrow|year=2015|isbn= 978-1784753269}}</ref>\n\nCollins first began to emerge as a major figure in the vacuum created by the executions of the 1916 leadership. He began hatching plans for \"next time\" even before the prison ships left Dublin.<ref>{{citebook|first= Margery|last= Forester|quote= Nancy O'Brien cousin of Michael Collins|title=The Lost Leader|publisher= Gill & MacMillan, Limited|year= 2006|isbn= 978-0717140145}}</ref>\n\nAt Frongoch he was one of the organisers of a program of protest and non-cooperation with authorities, similar to that later carried on by IRA internees in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s. The camp proved an excellent opportunity for networking with [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical-force republicans]] from all over the country, of which he became a key organiser.<ref name=\"TP\"/><ref>Teilifl\u00eds Gaeltachta / Radio Teilifl\u00eda \u00c9ireann \"An gCoilaiste R\u00e9abhloid\" 2010</ref>\n\nWhile some celebrated the fact that a rising had happened at all, believing in Pearse's theory of \"blood sacrifice\" (namely that the deaths of the Rising's leaders would inspire others), Collins railed against the military blunders made, such as the seizure of indefensible and very vulnerable positions like [[St Stephen's Green]], which were impossible to escape from and difficult to supply. Public outcry placed pressure on the British government to end the internment. In December 1916, the Frongoch prisoners were sent home.\n\n==1917\u20131918==\nBefore his death, [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], first signatory of the 1916 Proclamation and widely considered the Rising's foremost organiser, had designated his wife [[Kathleen Clarke]] as the official caretaker of Rising official business, in the event that the leadership did not survive. By June 1916, Mrs. Clarke had sent out the first post-Rising communiqu\u00e9 to the IRB, declaring the Rising to be only the beginning and directing nationalists to prepare for \"the next blow.\" Soon after his release Mrs. Clarke appointed Collins Secretary to the National Aid and Volunteers Dependents Fund (NAVDF) and subsequently passed on to him the secret organisational information and contacts which she had held in trust for the independence movement.\n\n[[File:Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith.jpg|right|upright=1.35|thumb|Michael Collins and [[Arthur Griffith]]]]\n\nCollins became one of the leading figures in the post-Rising independence movement spearheaded by [[Arthur Griffith]], editor/publisher of the main [[nationalist]] newspaper [[The United Irishman]], (which Collins had read avidly as a boy.)<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\">Coogan, TP. ''Michael Collins'', 1990</ref> Griffith's organisation [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] had been founded in 1905 as an umbrella group to unify all the various factions within the nationalist movement.\n\nUnder Griffith's policy, Collins and other advocates of the \"physical-force\" approach to independence gained the cooperation of non-violent Sinn F\u00e9in, while agreeing to disagree with Griffith's moderate ideas of a [[dual monarchy]] solution based on the Hungarian model.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Feeney, Brian. ''Sinn Fein: a Hundred Turbulent Years'', Dublin; O'Brien Press Ltd., 2002</ref> The British government and mainstream Irish media had wrongly blamed Sinn F\u00e9in for the Rising. This attracted Rising participants to join the organisation in order to exploit the reputation with which such British propaganda had imbued the organisation. By October 1917 Collins had risen to become a member of the executive of Sinn F\u00e9in and director of organisation for the [[Irish Volunteers]]. [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], another veteran of 1916, stood for the presidency of Sinn F\u00e9in against Griffith, who stepped aside and supported de Valera's presidency.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n==First D\u00e1il==\n[[File:First dail restoration3.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|''Members of the First D\u00e1il'' <br /> First row, left to right: [[Laurence Ginnell]], Michael Collins, [[Cathal Brugha]], [[Arthur Griffith]], [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], [[George Noble Plunkett|Count Plunkett]], [[Eoin MacNeill]], [[W. T. Cosgrave]], [[Kevin O'Higgins]] (third row, right)]]\n\nIn the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]] Sinn F\u00e9in swept the polls throughout much of Ireland, with many seats uncontested, and formed an overwhelming parliamentary majority in Ireland. Like many senior Sinn F\u00e9in representatives Collins was elected as an MP (for [[South Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|Cork South]]) with the right to sit in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in London. Unlike their rivals in the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP), Sinn F\u00e9in MPs had announced that they would not take their seats in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] but instead would set up an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in Dublin.<ref name=\"elecs_irl\">{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=6695|title=Michael Collins|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nBefore the new body's first meeting, Collins, tipped off by his network of spies, warned his colleagues of plans to arrest all its members in overnight raids. De Valera and others ignored the warnings on the argument that, if the arrests happened, they would constitute a [[propaganda]] coup. The intelligence proved accurate and de Valera, along with Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who followed his advice, were arrested; Collins and others evaded incarceration.\n\nThe new parliament, called [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (meaning \"Assembly of Ireland\", see [[First D\u00e1il]]) met in the [[Mansion House, Dublin]] in January 1919. In de Valera's absence, [[Cathal Brugha]] was elected [[Pr\u00edomh Aire]] ('First' or 'Prime' Minister but often translated as 'President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann'). The following April, Collins engineered de Valera's escape from [[Lincoln (HM Prison)|Lincoln Prison]] in England, after which Brugha was replaced by de Valera.\n\nNo [[Nation state|state]] gave diplomatic recognition to the 1919 Republic, despite sustained lobbying in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] by de Valera and prominent [[Irish-Americans]] and at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris peace conference]]. In January 1919 the D\u00e1il ratified the [[Irish Republican Army]]'s (IRA) claim to be the army of the [[Irish Republic]]. The IRA had begun a military campaign coincidentally on the same day as the D\u00e1il's first sitting with the [[Soloheadbeg Ambush]], and the IRA's respect for the D\u00e1il's authority was highly conditional. (The Irish Volunteers began to be referred to as the IRA since their internment at Frongoch. Up until the Civil War, the two terms were used interchangeably.)\n\n==Minister for Finance==\nDe Valera appointed Collins as [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] in the [[Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] in 1919.<ref>Mackay, p. 116</ref> Most of the ministries existed only on paper or as one or two people working in a room of a private house, given the circumstances of war in which they were liable to be arrested or killed by the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], [[British Army]], [[Black and Tans]] or [[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]].\n\nDespite that, Collins managed to produce a Finance Ministry that was able to organise a large bond issue in the form of a \"National Loan\" to fund the new Irish Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://generalmichaelcollins.com/National_Loan/National_Loan_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515172519/http://generalmichaelcollins.com/National_Loan/National_Loan_1.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }} Collins 22 Society Page on \"The National Loan 1920\"</ref> According to [[Batt O'Connor]], the D\u00e1il Loan raised almost \u00a3400,000, of which \u00a325,000 was in gold.

The two policemen were shot dead during the engagement. This ambush is considered the first action in the Irish War of Independence.<ref>Breen, Dan.

''Guerrilla Days in Ireland'', Dublin, Irish Press 1949</ref>\n\nThe Crown responded with escalation of the war, with the importation of special forces such as the \"[[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]]\", the \"[[Black and Tans]]\", the \"[[Cairo Gang]]\", and others. Officially or unofficially, many of these groups were given a free hand to institute a reign of terror, shooting Irish people indiscriminately, invading homes, looting and burning.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>[[Kathleen Clarke|Clarke, Kathleen]]. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'', O'Brien Press 2008</ref>\n\nAs the war began in earnest, de Valera travelled to the United States for an extended speaking tour to raise funds for the outlawed Republican government. It was in publicity for this tour that de Valera (who had been elected [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|Pr\u00edomh Aire]] by the D\u00e1il) was first referred to as \"President\". While financially successful, grave political conflicts followed in de Valera's wake there which threatened the unity of Irish-American support for the rebels. Some members of the IRB also objected to the use of the presidential title because their organisation's constitution had a different definition of that title.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref>Clarke, Kathleen. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'', Dublin O'Brien Press Ltd 2008</ref>\n\nBack in Ireland, Collins arranged the \"National Loan\", organised the IRA, effectively led the government, and managed arms-smuggling operations. Local guerrilla units received supplies, training and had largely a free hand to develop the war in their own region. These were the \"flying columns\" who comprised the bulk of the War of Independence rank and file in the south-west. Collins, [[Dick McKee]] and regional commanders such as [[Dan Breen]] and [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] oversaw tactics and general strategy. There were also regional organisers, such as Ernie O'Malley and Liam Mellows, who reported directly to Collins at St Ita's secret basement GHQ in central Dublin.<ref>E O'Malley. ''On Another Man's Wound'', (Dublin 1937)</ref> They were supported by a vast intelligence network of men and women in all walks of life that reached deep into the British administration in Ireland.<ref>[[Tom Barry (soldier)|Barry, Tom]].

''Florence and Josephine O'Donoghue's War of Independence'', Dublin, Irish Academic Press, 2006</ref>\n[[File:General Collins.jpg|upright|thumb|Collins inspects a soldier.]]\nIt was at this time that Collins created a special [[assassination]] unit called [[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|The Squad]] expressly to kill British agents and informers. Collins was criticised for these tactics but cited the universal war-time practice of executing enemy spies who were, in his words, \"hunting victims for execution.\" Campaigning for Irish independence, even non-violently, was still targeted both by prosecutions under British law entailing the death penalty and also by extrajudicial killings such as that of [[Tomas MacCurtain]], nationalist mayor of Cork City.\n\nIn 1920 the British offered [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]10,000 (equivalent to GB\u00a3300,000 / \u20ac360,000 in 2010) for information leading to Collins' capture or death. He evaded capture and continued to strike against British forces, often operating from safe-houses near government buildings, such as Vaughan's and [[An Stad]].\n\nIn 1920, following Westminster's prominent announcements that it had the Irish insurgents on the run, Collins and his Squad killed several British secret service agents in a series of coordinated raids. In retaliation, members of the Royal Irish Constabulary went to Croke Park, where a G.A.A. football match was taking place between Dublin and Tipperary. The police officers opened fire on the crowd, killing twelve and wounding sixty.  This event became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]]. A stampede of panicking British operatives sought the shelter of [[Dublin Castle]] next day. About the same time, Tom Barry's 3rd Cork Brigade took no prisoners in a bitter battle with British forces at [[Kilmichael Ambush|Kilmichael]]. In many regions, the RIC and other crown forces became all but confined to the strongest barracks in the larger towns as rural areas came increasingly under rebel control.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/><ref>[[Neligan, David]]. ''The Spy In the Castle'', London, Prendeville Publishing 1999</ref>\n\nThese republican victories would have been impossible without widespread support from the Irish population, which included every level of society and reached deep into the British administration in Ireland. This pattern of guerrilla success against sophisticated imperialist powers was repeated around the world in the early 20th century.<ref>[[Deasy, Liam]]. ''Brother Against Brother'', Cork, Mercier 1982</ref>\n\nAt the time of the ceasefire in July 1921 a major operation was allegedly in planning to execute every British secret service agent in Dublin, while a major ambush involving eighty officers and men was also planned for [[Templeglantine]], County Limerick.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"generalmichaelcollins.com\">[http://generalmichaelcollins.com/Michael_Collins_Life_and_Times/8.THE_TRUCE.html Page at generalmichaelcollins.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515210232/http://generalmichaelcollins.com/Michael_Collins_Life_and_Times/8.THE_TRUCE.html |date=15 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Truce==\nIn 1921 General Macready, commander of British forces in Ireland, reported to his government that the Empire's only hope of holding Ireland was by martial law, including the suspension of \"all normal life.\"<ref>''Wilson Diaries'', Vol II p. 293</ref> Westminster's foreign policy ruled out this option: Irish-American public opinion was important to British agendas in Asia. In addition, Britain's efforts at a military solution had already resulted in a powerful peace movement, which demanded an end to the unrest in Ireland. Prominent voices calling for negotiation included the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], ''[[The Times]]'' and other leading periodicals, members of the [[House of Lords]], [[English Catholics]], and famous authors such as [[George Bernard Shaw]].<ref>Cabinet Office, (Westminster government) London</ref><ref>British Cabinet minutes, 1921</ref>\n\nStill, it was not the British government that initiated negotiations. Individual English activists, including clergy, made private overtures which reached Arthur Griffith. Griffith expressed his welcome for dialogue. The British MP [[Brigadier General Cockerill]] sent an open letter to Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] that was printed in the Times, outlining how a peace conference with the Irish should be organised. The Pope made an urgent public appeal for a negotiated end to the violence. Whether or not Lloyd George welcomed such advisors, he could no longer hold out against this tide.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/>\n\nIn July, Lloyd George's government [[Irish War of Independence#Truce: July\u2013December 1921|offered a truce]]. Arrangements were made for a conference between British government and the leaders of the yet-unrecognised Republic. There remains uncertainty as to the two sides' capability to have carried on the conflict much longer. Collins told Hamar Greenwood after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty: \"You had us dead beat. We could not have lasted another three weeks. When we were told of the offer of a truce we were astonished. We thought you must have gone mad\".<ref>L. S. Amery, ''My Political Life. Volume Two: War and Peace 1914\u20131929'' (London: Hutchinson, 1953), p. 230.</ref> However he stated on the record that \"there will be no compromise and no negotiations with any British Government until Ireland is recognised as an independent republic. The same effort that would get us Dominion Home Rule will get us a republic.\"<ref>Michael Collins, quoted by columnist CW Ackerman August 1920</ref> At no time had the D\u00e1il or the IRA asked for a conference or a truce.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Deasy, Liam. ''Brother Against Brother''</ref>\n\nHowever, the D\u00e1il as a whole was less uncompromising. It decided to proceed to a peace conference, although it was ascertained in the preliminary stages that a fully independent republic would not be on the table and that the loss of some northeastern counties was a foregone conclusion.<ref>Phoenix, Eamonn. ''Michael Collins \u2013 The Northern Question 1916\u201322'', in. ''Michael Collins and the Making of the Irish State'', (Doherty & Keogh, editors)</ref>\n\nMany of the rebel forces on the ground first heard of the Truce when it was announced in the newspapers and this gave rise to the first fissures in nationalist unity, which had serious consequences later on. They felt they had not been included in consultations regarding its terms.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/><ref>O'Donoghue, Florence. ''No Other Law'', Dublin, Irish Press 1954</ref>\n\nDe Valera was widely acknowledged as the most skillful negotiator on the D\u00e1il government side and he participated in the initial parlays, agreeing the basis on which talks could begin. The first meetings were held in strict secrecy soon after the Customs House battle, with Andrew Cope representing Dublin Castle's British authorities. Later, de Valera travelled to London for the first official contact with Lloyd George. The two met one-on-one in a private meeting, the proceedings of which have never been revealed.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceG\">Neligan, David. ''The Spy In the Castle'', London, Prendeville Publishing 1999</ref>\n\nDuring this Truce period, de Valera sued for official designation as President of the Irish Republic and obtained it from the D\u00e1il in August 1921, in place of the title which had previously been used of [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat. ''The IRA: A History'', p. 76</ref> Not long after, the Cabinet was obliged to select the delegation that would travel to the London peace conference and negotiate a treaty. In an extraordinary departure from his usual role, de Valera adamantly declined to attend, insisting instead that Collins should take his place there, along with Arthur Griffith.<ref>British Cabinet minutes, memoranda</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}}<ref>De Valera, Eamonn, correspondence to Michael Collins, 13 July 1921</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nCollins resisted the appointment, protesting that he was \"a soldier, not a politician\" and that his exposure to the London authorities would reduce his effectiveness as a guerrilla leader should hostilities resume. (He had kept his public visibility to a minimum during the conduct of the war; up to this time the British still had very few reliable photographs of him.)<ref name=\"ReferenceH\">O'Connor, Batt. ''With Michael Collins in the Fight For Irish Independence'', 1929</ref> The Cabinet of seven split on the issue, with de Valera casting the deciding vote. Many of Collins's associates warned him not to go, that he was being set up as a political scapegoat. Following intense soul-searching and all-night consultations with his most trusted advisors, he resolved to attend \"in the spirit of a soldier obeying orders.\" In private correspondence he foresaw the catastrophe ahead: \"Let them make a scapegoat or whatever they like of me. Someone must go.\"\n\n==Anglo-Irish Treaty==\n[[File:Michael Collins 1921.jpg|right|thumb|Collins in [[London]] as delegate to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] negotiations.]]\nThe Irish delegates to London were designated as \"plenipotentiaries\", meaning that they had full authority to sign an agreement on behalf of the D\u00e1il government. The Treaty would then be subject to approval by the D\u00e1il.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Jeremy|title=Britain and Ireland: From Home Rule to Independence|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317884934|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbqOAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA128|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> The majority of the delegates, including [[Arthur Griffith]] (leader), [[Robert Barton]] and [[Eamonn Duggan]] (with [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]] as Secretary General to the delegation) set up headquarters at 22 [[Hans Place]] in [[Knightsbridge]] on 11 October 1921. Collins shared quarters at 15 Cadogan Gardens with the delegation's publicity department, secretary [[Diarmuid O'Hegarty]], [[Joseph McGrath (Irish politician)|Joseph McGrath]] as well as substantial intelligence and bodyguard personnel including [[Liam Tobin]], Tom Cullen, [[Eamon Broy|Ned Broy]], [[Emmet Dalton]] and Joseph Dolan of [[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|The Squad]].<ref>Mackay, p. 217</ref>\n\nThe British team were led by their Prime Minister Lloyd George, the Colonial Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] and [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|F. E. Smith]]. During two months of arduous negotiations the Irish delegates made frequent crossings between London and Dublin to confer with their D\u00e1il colleagues, and Collins's correspondence reflects his frustration at D\u00e1il debates and the Irish delegate's inability to agree clear instruction as to whether or not they should accept a treaty.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins''</ref> \n\nIn November, with the London peace talks still in progress, Collins attended a large meeting of regional IRA commanders at Parnell Place in Dublin. In a private conference he informed [[Liam Deasy]], [[Florence O'Donoghue]] and [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] that there would have to be some compromise in the current negotiations in London. \"There was no question of our getting all the demands we were making.\" He was advised by Lynch not to bring this out in the full assembly. Reviewing subsequent events, Deasy later doubted the wisdom of that advice.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> \n\nThe negotiations ultimately resulted in the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] which was signed on 6 December 1921. The agreement provided for a [[Dominion]] status \"[[Irish Free State]]\", whose relationship to the British [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] would be modelled after Canada's. This was a compromise, half-way between an independent republic and a province of the Empire. The Treaty was signed under considerable pressure from the British. The negotiators had agreed at the cabinet meeting in Dublin that they would not sign the Treaty without bringing it back for the Dail cabinet to ratify. But once back in London on December 5th at 7:30 pm, Lloyd George told them it was immediate signature or 'immediate and terrible war' and that he had to know by the next day. The Treaty was signed at 2:20 am, December 6, 1921. <ref>Frank Pakenham, Peace by Ordeal, (1972) p.245-247</ref>\n\nThe settlement overturned the Act of Union by recognising the native Irish legislature's independence. Under a [[bicameral parliament]], executive authority would remain vested in the king, represented in Ireland by a [[Governor General]], but exercised by an Irish government elected by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as a \"[[lower house]]\". British forces would depart the Free State forthwith and be replaced by an Irish army. Along with an independent judiciary, the Treaty granted the new Free State greater [[independence]] than any Irish state, and went well beyond the Home Rule which had been sought by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] or by his [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] successors John Redmond and John Dillon.\n\nThe Treaty acknowledged the partition of Ireland. Before Treaty negotiations had concluded, executive powers had already been passed to the government of [[Northern Ireland]] created under the [[Government of Ireland Act]] in 1920. <ref>Ronan, Fanning, The Fatal Path, British Government and Irish Revolution 1910-1922, p288</ref> Northern Ireland, which had a majority [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] population, could opt out of the Free State, a year after the signing of the Treaty. An [[Irish Boundary Commission]] was to be established to draw a border, 'in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants' and \u2018economic and geographic conditions\u2019.<ref>Liam Weeks, Michael O Fatharthaigh, The Treaty, p.279</ref> Collins anticipated a redrawing of the border would result in much of the south and west of Northern Ireland becoming part of the Free State, making Northern Ireland economically non-viable,and facilitating the reunification of the 32 counties in the near future.<ref>Phoenix, Eamonn. ''Michael Collins \u2013 The Northern Question 1916\u201322'', in. ''Michael Collins and the Making of the Irish State'', (Doherty & Keogh, editors)</ref>\n\nCollins argued that he had signed the Treaty as the alternative was a war that the Irish people did not want. 'I say that rejection of the Treaty is a declaration of war until you have beaten the British Empire, apart from any alternative document. Rejection of the Treaty means your national policy is war.... The Treaty was signed by me, not because they held up the alternative of immediate war. I signed it because I would not be one of those to commit the Irish people to war without the Irish people committing themselves to war'. <ref>Dail Debate on Treaty 19 December 1921, https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-12-19/2/</ref>  While the Treaty fell short of the republic for which he had fought, Collins concluded that the Treaty offered Ireland \"not the freedom that all nations desire and develop to, but the freedom to achieve it.\" .<ref>Collins, Michael. ''The Path To Freedom'', Cork, Mercier 1968</ref> \n\nNonetheless, he knew that elements of the Treaty would cause controversy in Ireland. Upon signing the treaty, F. E. Smith remarked \"I may have signed my political death warrant tonight\". Collins replied \"I may have signed my actual death warrant\".<ref name=\"generalmichaelcollins.com\" />\n\n===Treaty debates===\n\nThis remark encapsulated his acknowledgement that the Treaty was a compromise that would be vulnerable to charges of \"sell-out\" from purist Republicans. It did not establish the fully independent republic that Collins himself had shortly before demanded as a non-negotiable condition. The \"physical force republicans\" who made up the bulk of the army which had fought the British to a draw would be loath to accept dominion status within the [[British Empire]] or an [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] that mentioned the King. Also controversial was the British retention of [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]] on the south coast of Ireland for the [[Royal Navy]]. These factors diminished Irish sovereignty and threatened to allow British interference in Ireland's foreign policy. Collins and Griffith were well aware of these issues and strove tenaciously, against British resistance, to achieve language which could be accepted by all constituents. They succeeded in obtaining an oath to the Irish Free State, with a subsidiary oath of fidelity to the King, rather than to the king unilaterally.\n\nEamon De Valera, the President of the Dail objected to the Treaty on the grounds that it had been signed without cabinet consent and that it secured neither the full independence of Ireland nor Irish unity. <ref>Frank Pakenham, Peace by Ordeal, (1972), p209-211</ref> Collins and his supporters argued that de Valera had refused strenuous pleas from Collins, Griffith and others to lead the London negotiations in person. He had  refused the delegates' continual requests for instruction, and in fact had been at the centre of the original decision to enter negotiations without the possibility of an independent republic on the table.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceI\">O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins'', Dublin, Gill & MacMillan 1980</ref>\n\nThe Treaty controversy split the entire nationalist movement. Sinn F\u00e9in, the D\u00e1il, the IRB and the army each divided into pro- and anti-Treaty factions. The Supreme Council of the IRB had been informed in detail about every facet of the Treaty negotiations and had approved many of its provisions, and they voted unanimously to accept the Treaty with the single notable exception of [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]], later COS of the anti-Treaty IRA.<ref>Coogan, ''Michael Collins'', pp. 236\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe D\u00e1il debated the Treaty bitterly for ten days until it was approved by a vote of 64 to 57.<ref>[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E900003-001/ Debate on the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland...] from University College Cork</ref> Having lost this vote, de Valera announced his intent to withdraw his participation from the D\u00e1il and called on all deputies who had voted against the Treaty to follow him. A substantial number did so, officially splitting the government.\n\nA large part of the Irish Republican Army opposed the Treaty and in March 1922 voted at an Army Convention to reject the authority of the Dail, Collins' GHQ and to elect their own Executive. Anti-Treaty IRA units began to seize buildings and take other guerrilla actions against the Provisional Government. On 14 April 1922, a group of 200 anti-Treaty IRA men occupied the Four Courts in Dublin under [[Rory O'Connor (Irish republican)|Rory O'Connor]], a hero of the War of Independence. The [[Four Courts]] was the centre of the Irish courts system, originally under the British and then the Free State. Collins was charged by his Free State colleagues with putting down these insurgents, however, he resisted firing on former comrades and staved off a shooting war throughout this period.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\">Provisional Government minutes, Public Records Office, Dublin</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceK\">O'Donoghue, Florence. ''No Other Law'', Dublin, Irish Press, 1954</ref>\n\nWhile the country teetered on the edge of civil war, continuous meetings were carried on among the various factions from January to June 1922. In these discussions the nationalists strove to resolve the issue without armed conflict. Collins and his close associate, [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) [[Harry Boland]] were among those who worked desperately to heal the rift.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>Fitzpatrick, David. ''Harry Boland's Irish Revolution'', Cork, Cork University Press, 2003</ref>\n\nTo foster military unity, Collins and the IRB established an \"army re-unification committee\", including delegates from pro- and anti-Treaty factions. The still-secret Irish Republican Brotherhood continued to meet, fostering dialogue between pro- and anti-Treaty IRA officers. In the IRB's stormy debates on the subject, Collins held out the Constitution of the new Free State as a possible solution. Collins was then in the process of co-writing that document and was striving to make it a republican constitution that included provisions that would allow anti-Treaty TDs to take their seats in good conscience, without any oath concerning the Crown.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/>\n\n==Northern Ireland==\n\nCollins' policy toward Northern Ireland was ambiguous. He told the Dail during the Treaty debates that, 'We have stated we would not coerce the North-East ... Surely we recognise that the North-East corner does exist, and surely our intention was that we should take such steps as would sooner or later lead to mutual understanding. The Treaty has made an effort to deal with it .. on lines that will lead very rapidly to goodwill, and the entry of the North-East under the Irish Parliament. I don't say it is an ideal arrangement, but if our policy is, as has been stated, a policy of non-coercion'. <ref>Dail Debate on Treaty 19 December 1921, https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-12-19/2/</ref>\n\nHowever he told the Northern Divisions of the IRA in private, early in 1922 that, \u2018although the Treaty may have seemed as an outward expression of partition, the [Provisional Irish] Government plans to make it [partition] impossible\u2026even if it meant smashing the Treaty\u2019. <ref>Donnacha O Beachain, From Partition to Brexit, The Irish Government and Northern Ireland, 2019, p. 13 </ref> Collins' Provisional Government also funded county councils and paid the salaries of teachers in Northern Ireland who recognised the Free State.\n\nIn Northern Ireland in the first half of 1922, there was considerable violence between rival forces along he new border, the IRA on the southern side and the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] on the Northern side. There were also many killings of civilians, notably by \"unauthorised loyalist paramilitary forces\" who targeted Catholics. Catholic were also driven out of their jobs, notably in Belfast's shipyards.\n\nIn March, Collins met [[Sir James Craig]], Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, in London. They signed an agreement declaring peace in the north which promised cooperation between Catholics and Protestants in policing and security, a generous budget for restoring Catholics to homes which had been destroyed, and many other measures.<ref>British Cabinet Office</ref> The day after the agreement was published, violence erupted again. A policeman was shot dead in Belfast and in reprisal, police entered Catholic homes nearby and shot residents in their beds, including children. There was no response to Collins's demands for an inquiry. He and his Cabinet warned that they would deem the agreement broken unless Craig took action.<ref>MC official correspondence, 5 and 10 April 1922</ref> In his continual correspondence with Churchill over violence in the north, Collins protested repeatedly that such breaches of the Truce threatened to invalidate the Treaty entirely.<ref>Michael Collins letter to Churchill 6 June 1922</ref> The prospect was real enough that on 3 June 1922 Churchill presented to the Committee of Imperial Defence his plans \"to protect Ulster from invasion by the South.\"<ref>British Cabinet minutes 16/42 Public Records Office, London</ref>\n\nThroughout the early months of 1922, Collins had been sending IRA units to the border and sending arms and money to the northern units of the IRA. Collins joined other IRB and IRA leadership in developing secret plans to launch a clandestine guerrilla war in the northeast. Some British arms that had been supplied to the Provisional government in Dublin were turned over by Collins to IRA units in the north. In May\u2013June 1922 Collins and IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch organised an offensive that would involve mobilising and arming ''both'' pro- and anti-Treaty IRA units along the border area.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-44083967 BBC Northern Ireland]</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Derrig |first1=Mick |title=Michael Collins' Unfinished Revolution |url=https://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/5476 |accessdate=12 June 2019 |work=An Phoblacht |date=21 October 1999}}</ref> Because of this, most northern IRA units supported Collins and 524 individual volunteers came south to join the National Army in the Irish Civil War.\n\nThis activity was supposed to culminate in a 'joint Northern offensive' in May 1922 that was to involve both pro and anti-Treaty IRA units. However, it appears that Collins countermanded the offensive at the last minute. While the Northern units took part, the Divisions based in southern territory and under Collins' authority, the 1st, 4th and 5th Northern Divisions did not, leading to the suppression of the offensive with relative ease by the Northern authorities.<ref> [https://www.theirishstory.com/2019/08/12/michael-collins-northern-ireland-and-the-northern-offensive-may-1922/#.Xl0rwPTgrIV Patrick Concannon, Michael Collins, Northern Ireland and the Northern Offensive, May 1922, The Irish Story August 2019.

Accessed March 2020]</ref>\n\nAt the time of his death in August 1922, it was still unclear what Collins' true intentions towards Northern Ireland were.\n\n==Provisional government==\n[[File:Michael Collins addressing crowd in Cork cph.3b15295.jpg|left|thumb|Michael Collins addresses a crowd in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], 1922.]]\nDe Valera resigned the presidency and sought re-election but Arthur Griffith replaced him after a close vote on 9 January 1922. Griffith chose as his title President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, rather than President of the Republic as de Valera had favoured.<ref>Younger, Calton. ''Arthur Griffith'', Dublin, Gill & Macmillan 1981</ref> The D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann government did not hold legal status in British [[constitutional law]]. The provisions of the Treaty required the formation of a ''new'' government, which would be recognised by Westminster as pertaining to the Free State dominion that had been established by the Treaty. Despite the abdication of a large part of the D\u00e1il, the [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government (Rialtas Sealadach na h\u00c9ireann)]] was formed by Arthur Griffith as President and Michael Collins as Chairman of the Cabinet (effectively [[Prime Minister]]). Collins retained his position as Minister for Finance.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\"/>\n\nIn British legal tradition, Collins was now a Crown-appointed prime minister of a Commonwealth state, installed under the [[Royal Prerogative]]. To be so installed he had to formally meet the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] [[Edmund FitzAlan-Howard, 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent|Viscount FitzAlan]] the head of the British administration in Ireland. The republican view of the same meeting is that Collins met FitzAlan to accept the surrender of [[Dublin Castle]], the official seat of British government in Ireland. Having surrendered, FitzAlan still remained in place as viceroy until December 1922.\n\nThe Provisional Government's first obligation was to create a Constitution for the Free State. This was undertaken by Collins and a team of solicitors. The outcome of their work became the Irish Constitution of 1922.<ref>The Constitution of the Irish Free State 1922 http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/E900003-004/</ref> He drew up a republican constitution which, without repudiating the Treaty, would include no mention of the British king. His object was that the Constitution would allow participation in the D\u00e1il by dissenting TDs who opposed the Treaty and refused to take any oath mentioning the Crown. Under the Treaty, the Free State was obliged to submit its new Constitution to Westminster for approval. Upon doing so, in June 1922, Collins and Griffith found Lloyd George determined to veto the provisions they had fashioned to prevent civil war.<ref>Coogan, TP. ''Michael Collins''</ref>\n\nThe meetings with Lloyd George and Churchill were bitter and contentious. Collins, although less diplomatic than Griffith or de Valera, had no less penetrating comprehension of political issues. He complained that he was being manipulated into \"doing Churchill's dirty work\", in a potential civil war with his own former troops.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\"/><ref>Michael Collins \u2013 Winston Churchill correspondence June 1922</ref>\n\n==Pact elections==\nNegotiations to prevent civil war resulted in, among others, \"The Army Document\" published in May 1922 which was signed by an equal number of pro- and anti-Treaty IRA officers including Collins, Dan Breen, and [[Gear\u00f3id O'Sullivan]]. This manifesto declared that \"a closing of ranks all round is necessary\" to prevent \"the greatest catastrophe in Irish history.\" It called for new elections, to be followed by the re-unification of the government and army, whatever the result.\n\nIn this spirit and with the organising efforts of moderates on both sides the Collins-de Valera \"Pact\" was created. This pact agreed that new elections to the D\u00e1il would be held with each candidate running as explicitly pro- or anti-Treaty and that, regardless of which side obtained a majority, the two factions would then join to form a coalition government of national unity.\n\nA referendum on the Treaty was also planned but it never took place. The Pact elections on 16 June 1922 therefore comprise the best quantitative record of the Irish public's direct response to the Treaty. The results were pro-Treaty 58 seats, anti-Treaty 35, Labour Party 17, Independents 7, Farmers party 7, plus 4 Unionists from Trinity College, Dublin.<ref>Public Records Office, Dublin</ref>\n\n==Assassination of Sir Henry Wilson==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2018}}\nSix days after the Pact elections, [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Wilson]] was assassinated on 22 June 1922 in broad daylight on the steps of his London home by a pair of London IRA men. A British Army [[field marshal]], Wilson had recently resigned his commission and been elected an MP for a constituency in Northern Ireland. He had a long history as one of the chief British leaders opposing Collins in the Irish conflict. At that time Wilson had served as military advisor to the Northern Ireland government led by [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], in which role he was seen to be responsible for the B-Specials and for other sources of loyalist violence in the north.\n\nThe debate concerning Collins's involvement continued in the 1950s, when a number of statements and rebuttals on the subject were published in periodicals. These were re-printed with additions in Rex Taylor's 1961 book ''Assassination: the death of Sir Henry Wilson and the tragedy of Ireland''. Participants in that discussion were Joe Dolan, Florence O'Donoghue, Denis P. Kelleher, Patrick O'Sullivan and others.<ref>Taylor, Rex. ''Assassination: the death of Sir Henry Wilson and the tragedy of Ireland'', (London 1961)</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\n==Civil War==\n{{Main|Irish Civil War}}\n[[File:Bombarded Four Courts Irish Civil War.jpg|right|thumb|The Provisional Government, led by Collins, gave the order to bombard the [[Four Courts]] with artillery shells in an attempt to remove Anti-treaty IRA. This was the start of the [[Irish Civil War]].]]\nThe death of Sir Henry Wilson caused a furor in London. Lloyd George, the prime Minister sent a letter to Collins saying that the 'ambiguous position' of the Provisional government with regard to the IRA in the Four Courts could no longer be tolerated. <ref>Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, The Irish Civil War,(2004) p.114</ref>.  The British cabinet met the day after assassination and agreed that Collins reply had not given a 'definite enough commitment' to disperse the Four Courts occupation. They ordered [[Nevil Macready]] commander of the British garrison still in Dublin, to attack the Four Courts, whose republican garrison they blamed from the shooting of Wilson. <ref>Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, The Irish Civil War,(2004) p.115</ref>. The plan was put on hold at the last minute when Macready advised the government, on June 26, to give Collins' Provisional Government one more chance to act against the Four Courts. <ref>Ibid. p.116</ref> \n\nCollins himself was in Cork at the time of the crisis. President Arthur Griffith and military officer Emmet Dalton met with British official to discuss 'the continued occupation of the Four Courts by the Irregulars under Rory O'Connor'. <ref>Sean Boyne, Emmet Dalton, Somme Soldier, Irish General, Film Pioneer p.138 </ref> There is little documentation of the decision to taken by the Provisional government, headed by Collins, to attack the Four Courts; Historian Michael Hopkinson writes, 'the scarcity of evidence is explained by the acute sensitivity of the subject, both at the time and since'. <ref>Hopkinson, p.116</ref> When Collins arrived back in Dublin, his forces began to act against the anti-Treatyites. On June 27 they arrested anti-Treaty IRA officer Leo Henderson as he was enforcing the Belfast Boycott by seizing cars. <ref>Hopkinson p.117</ref> In retaliation the anti-Treaty IRA men abducted [[J.J. \"Ginger\" O'Connell]], a Free State general and held him in the Four Courts. <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.406</ref>\n\nThese two developments led to the Provisional Government's 27 June 1922 order serving notice on the Four Courts garrison to surrender the building, their arms and release O'Connell, that night or face military action \"at once\". <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.406</ref> According to historian Charles Townsend, 'Collins must have consented to this though the actual decision seems to have been taken by Griffith'. <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.407</ref> [[Peter Hart]] similarly writes, 'it was Griffith rather than Collins who took the lead in this decision'. <ref>Peter Hart, Mick, The Real Michael Collins, p.398</ref> However cabinet member Ernest Blythe recalled that, 'the decision to attack the Four Courts was almost automatic once Collins had agreed to it.<ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p.117</ref>\n\nCollins' position in this conflict was extraordinary indeed. A majority perhaps of the IRA he had helped lead in the War of Independence, were now ranged against the Provisional Government, which he represented. In addition, the force which by the will of the electorate he was obliged to lead had been re-organised since the Truce. Formed from a nucleus of pro-Treaty IRA men, it had evolved into a more formal, structured, uniformed [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] that was armed and funded by Britain. Many of the new members [[Ireland and World War I|were World War I veterans]] and others who had not fought on the nationalist side before. Collins's profoundly mixed feelings about this situation are recorded in his private and official correspondence.<ref>Kissane, Bill.

[[Emmet Dalton]], an Irishman who had served in the British Army and the IRA, who was now a leading Free State commander and close associate of Collins, was placed in charge of it. The Four Courts surrendered after three days of fighting.\n\nHeavy [[Battle of Dublin (1922)|fighting broke out in Dublin]] between the anti-Treaty IRA Dublin Brigade and the Free State troops. Much of O'Connell Street suffered heavy damage; the Gresham Hotel was burned and the Four Courts reduced to a ruin. Still, under Collins' direction, the Free State rapidly took control of the capital. By July 1922 anti-Treaty forces held much of the southern province of Munster and several other areas of the country. At the height of their success, they administered local government and policing in large regions.<ref>Clarke, Kathleen. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'' O'Brien Press 2008</ref> Collins, Richard Mulcahy, and Eoin O'Duffy decided on a series of seaborne landings into republican held areas, which re-took Munster and the west in July\u2013August.\n\nThat July, Collins set aside his title as Chairman of the Provisional Government to become Commander-in-Chief of the National Army. However, according to Charles Townshend, he became 'a kind of generalisimo, combining military and political supremacy. Griffith had no desire or capacity to dispute the day to day conduct of government with him and while Mulcahy had great administrative capacity, he deferred to Collins as a strategist and thinker'.<ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.423</ref> He also [[prorogued]] the meeting of the Dail, or parliament until the end of hostilities, a move that historians such as John Regan have seen as an unconstitutional concentration of power in Collins himself and his military colleagues.<ref>John Regan, Myth and the Irish State (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 2013), pp. 91</ref>\n\n===Civil War peace moves===\n\nRoughly two weeks after Cork city had been taken by Provisional Government forces, Collins travelled there to attempt to seize large sums of money that the anti-Treaty Republicans had lodged in various banks, under the account of the Land Bank. <ref>Dermot Keogh, Michael Collins, the making of the Irish Free State, (2006) p.67-68</ref>\n\nThere is also considerable evidence that Collins's journey to Cork in August 1922 was made in order to meet republican leaders with a view to ending the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\">Feehan, John M.

''The Assassination of Michael Collins: What Happened at B\u00e9al na mBl\u00e1th?'', Create Space/KDP 2013</ref> \n\nCollins also conducted a series of meetings, regarding the possibility of peace talks in Cork on 21\u201322 August 1922.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> In Cork city, Collins met with neutral IRA members [[Se\u00e1n O'Hegarty]] and [[Florence O'Donoghue]] with a view to contacting Anti-Treaty IRA leaders [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] and [[Tom Hales (Irish republican)|Tom Hales]] to propose a truce. The anti-Treaty side had called a major convocation of officers to B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th, a remote crossroads, with ending the war on the agenda.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/>\n[[File:Michael Collins Risteard Mulcahy Glasnevin Cemetery at the funeral of Arthur Griffith.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Collins and [[Richard Mulcahy]] at [[Arthur Griffith]]'s funeral, a few days before Collins' own death.]]\nDe Valera was present there, however, Michel Hopkinson writes that 'there is no evidence that there was any prospect of a meeting between de Valera and Collins <ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p.177</ref>. The People's Rights Association, a local initiative in Cork City, had been mediating a discussion of terms between the Provisional Government and the anti-Treaty side for some weeks.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/>\n\nCollins's personal diary outlined his proposals for peace. Republicans must \"accept the People's Verdict\" on the Treaty, but could then \"go home without their arms. We don't ask for any surrender of their principles\".<ref>Hopkinson, Green against Green, p. 177</ref> He argued that the Provisional Government was upholding \"the people's rights\" and would continue to do so. \"We want to avoid any possible unnecessary destruction and loss of life. We do not want to mitigate their weakness by resolute action beyond what is required\". But if Republicans did not accept his terms, \"further blood is on their shoulders\".<ref>Hopkinson, Green against Green, p. 177-178</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Michael Collins body lying in hospital.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Collins' body laid out at [[St. Vincent's University Hospital|St Vincent's Hospital]] in Dublin.]]\nIn August 1922, it seemed as though the Civil War was winding down. The Free State had regained control of most of the country, and Collins was making frequent trips to inspect areas recently recovered from anti-Treaty forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\"/>\n\nHis plan to travel to his native Cork on 20 August was considered particularly dangerous, and he was strenuously advised against it by several trusted associates. County Cork was an IRA stronghold as much of it was still held by anti-Treaty forces. Yet he was determined to make the trip without delay. He had fended off a number of attempts on his life in the preceding weeks and had acknowledged more than once, in private conversation, that the Civil War might end his life at any moment. On several occasions, Collins assured his advisors \"they won't shoot me in my own county,\" or words to that effect.\n\n[[File:Crossley Tender rear 146440.jpg|right|thumb|A replica of the Crossley Tender in Collins' convoy on the day of his death in a replica of the road where it happened on display at the Michael Collins Centre, Clonakilty<ref>[http://www.michaelcollinscentre.com/index.html Michael Collins Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301105029/http://www.michaelcollinscentre.com/index.html |date=1 March 2012 }}, Clonakilty</ref>]]\nOn 22 August 1922 Collins set out from Cork City on a circuitous tour of West Cork. He passed first through Macroom then took the [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] road via [[Crookstown, County Cork|Crookstown]]. This led through [[B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th]], an isolated crossroads. There they stopped at a local pub named 'Long's Pub', now known as [[The Diamond Bar]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thediamondbar.wordpress.com/history/ | title=History| date=2015-04-28}}</ref> to ask a question of a man standing at the crossroad. The man turned out to be an anti-Treaty sentry. He and an associate recognised Collins in the back of the open-top car.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\nAs a result, an ambush was laid by an anti-Treaty column at that point, on the chance that the convoy might come through again on their return journey.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Between 7:30 and 8:00 pm, Collins' convoy approached B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th for the second time. By then most of the ambush party had dispersed and gone for the day, leaving just five or six men on the scene. Two were disarming a mine in the road, while three on a laneway overlooking them, provided cover. A dray cart, placed across the road, remained at the far end of the ambush site.\n\nThe Irregulars in the laneway opened fire with rifles on the convoy. Emmet Dalton ordered the driver of the touring car to 'drive like hell', but Collins said 'no, stop and we'll fight 'em' and jumped from the vehicle along with the others. Collins first took cover behind the low grass bank bordering the road but then jumped up and ran back along the road to begin firing with his Lee Enfield rifle from behind the armoured car. The Vickers machine gun in that car had also been firing at the attackers but then stopped because a badly-loaded ammunition belt caused it to jam. Apparently, to get a better view of the laneway, Collins left the protection of the armoured car and moved even farther back along the road. Now standing in the open, he fired a couple of shots and as he was once more working the bolt of his rifle he was struck in the head by a bullet fired by one of the ambushing party \u2013 Denis \"Sonny\" O'Neill, a former [[British Army]] [[sniper]].<ref>'Gunman believed to have killed Michael Collins was granted a military pension', 'The Irish Times', 3 October 2014.</ref>\n\nCollins was the only fatality sustained in the ambush, although another member of his party suffered a neck wound. After he was shot the fire from the ambushing party quickly fell off and they withdrew from the scene. Collins was found, face down, on the roadway. One of his men whispered an [[Act of Contrition]] into his ear, but Collins was clearly dead. He was lifted into the back of the touring car with his head resting against the shoulder of Emmet Dalton. The convoy cleared the dray cart obstruction and resumed its journey to Cork.\n\nThe lengthy time the convoy took to cover the twenty miles back to Cork City was because many of the roads were blocked and the convoy had to travel across muddy fields and through farms to circumnavigate the obstacles, all in darkness. At times, when the vehicles became bogged down, members of the convoy had to carry Collins' body on their shoulders. The touring car eventually had to be abandoned because of mechanical trouble.\n\nThere was no autopsy. Collins' field diary was taken by General Emmet Dalton who had been with him during his tour of the south. The body was first presented at Shanakiel Hospital in Cork, a small military establishment, and then shipped around the coast to Dublin where it was laid out in St Vincent's Hospital Dublin. From there it was removed to the City Hall beside Dublin Castle where it was laid in state.\n\n===Conspiracy and collusion===\nNumerous questions remain about the events surrounding the death of Collins because the only witnesses to his death were the members of the Free State Army convoy and the anti-Treaty ambushers. As no two stories match and participant statements from both sides are contradictory and inconsistent, unanswered questions linger about what happened that day.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\nThe man believed to have fired the fatal shot, Denis \"Sonny\" O'Neill, was a former officer from the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] who served as a [[sniper]] in the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]], joined the IRA in 1918 and had met Collins on more than one occasion. However, when the Irish Civil War started in June 1922, O'Neill joined the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|Anti-Treaty IRA]]; becoming one of the ambushers of Collins' convoy at [[Beal na Blath]] that August.<ref name=\"Sonny\"/>\n\nO'Neill remains a mysterious figure because of the contradictions in his biography: such as serving in the British Army but then joining the IRA. He provided them with information concerning the [[Igoe Gang]] that worked for the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|British Army Intelligence Centre]]. Twenty years after Collins' death, the Irish State granted O'Neill a Captain's military pension in the 1940s.<ref name=\"Sonny\">{{cite news|title=Gunman believed to have killed Michael Collins was granted a military pension|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date= 3 October 2014|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/gunman-believed-to-have-killed-michael-collins-was-granted-military-pension-1.1949934}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Sean Collins behind the coffin of his brother Michael.jpg|left|thumb|Sean Collins behind the coffin of his brother Michael.]]\n\nCollins lay in state for three days. Tens of thousands of mourners filed past his [[coffin]] to pay their respects, including many British soldiers departing Ireland who had fought against him. His funeral mass took place at Dublin's [[Pro Cathedral]] where a number of foreign and Irish dignitaries were in attendance. Some 500,000 people attended his funeral, almost one fifth of the country's population at that time.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/>\n\nNo official inquiry was ever undertaken into Collins's death and consequently, there is no official version of what happened, nor are there any authoritative, detailed contemporary records.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\n[[File:Collinsfuneral.jpg|right|thumb|Funeral of Michael Collins in the [[St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral|Pro-Cathedral]], Dublin (contemporary newspaper depiction of the [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]])]]\n\nIn this vacuum, independent investigations and conspiracy theorists have put forward a number of suspects as having executed or ordered his death, including an anti-Treaty sharpshooter, members of his own escort, the British secret service, or de Valera himself.\n\nDe Valera is alleged to have declared in 1966, \"It is my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Michael Collins; and it will be recorded at my expense.\"<ref>{{cite book|last= Dolan|first=Anne|title=Commemorating the Irish Civil War: History and Memory, 1923\u20132000 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=iS_3r0vHMxsC&pg=PA87 |series=Studies in the Social and Cultural History of Modern Warfare|volume=13|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02698-7|page=87}}</ref>\n\nA number of books have been devoted entirely to the study of Collins' death (in chronological order): ''The Day Michael Was Shot'' by Meda Ryan, ''The Shooting of Michael Collins: Murder or Accident?'' by John M.

Sigerson.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Michael Collins On Bicycle.jpg|right|thumb|Collins on his bicycle.]]\nCollins's elderly father inspired his fondness and respect for older people. His mother, who had spent her youth caring for her own invalid mother and raising her own brothers and sisters, was a powerful influence. The entire management of the Collins farm fell to her, as her husband succumbed to old age and died. In a society which honoured hospitality as a prime virtue, Mrs Collins was eulogised as \"a hostess in ten thousand.\" Her five daughters avowedly doted on their youngest brother.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/> He enjoyed rough-housing and outdoor sports. Having won a local wrestling championship while still a boy, he is said to have made a pastime of challenging larger, older opponents, with frequent success. A very fit, active man throughout life, in the most stressful times he continued to enjoy wrestling as a form of relaxation and valued friendships which afforded opportunities to share athletic pursuits.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/> He could be abrasive, demanding, and inconsiderate of those around him, but frequently made up for it with gestures such as confectionery and other small gifts.<ref>O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins'', Dublin, Gill & MacMillan 1980.{{Page needed|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnlike some of his political opponents, he was characterized by many close personal friendships within the movement. It has been justly said that while some were devoted to \"the idea of Ireland\", Collins was a people person whose patriotism was rooted in affection and respect for the people of Ireland around him. Among his famous last words is the final entry in his pocket diary, written on the journey which ended his life, \"The people are splendid.\"<ref>Michael Collins field diary, 22 August 1922</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceH\"/>\n\n[[File:Kitty Kiernan.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Kitty Kiernan]]\n\nIn 1921\u201322, he became engaged to [[Kitty Kiernan]].\n\nCollins was a complex man whose character abounded in contradictions. Although Minister of Finance and an accountant by pre-war profession, he seems never to have pursued personal profit; indeed he was sometimes all but homeless during the war for independence. This characteristic was exemplified by a letter he wrote on 4 August 1922 to his canvassing agent; offering to pay half the bill for a hired election car because some of the journeys had been for personal trips.<ref>Kennerk, Barry and Alison Healy, Evidence of an Irish Politician's Scruples on Expenses...in 1922 in  ''Irish Times'', 8 Nov. 2010</ref> While clearly fond of command and keen to take charge, he had an equal appetite for input and advice from people at every level of the organisation, prompting the comment that \"he took advice from his chauffeur.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceG\"/> Although acknowledged by friends and foes as \"head centre\" of the movement, he continually chose a title just short of actual head of state; becoming Chairman of the Provisional Government only after the abdication of half the D\u00e1il forced him to do so. While his official and personal correspondence records his solicitous care for the wants of insurgents in need, during the war he showed no hesitation in ordering the death of opponents who threatened nationalist lives.<ref>Collins, Michael (Costello, Francis J., Ed.) ''Michael Collins In His Own Words'', Dublin, Gill & Macmillan, 1997</ref>\n\nCertainly a man of fierce pride, his pride was tempered by a sense of humour that included a keen sense of the absurd in his own situation.<ref>Michael Collins personal correspondence</ref> While mastermind of a clandestine military, he remained a public figure. When official head of the Free State government, he continued to cooperate in the IRA's secret operations. He was capable of bold, decisive actions on his own authority, which caused friction with his colleagues, such as his falling out with [[Cathal Brugha]]; but at critical junctures he could also bow to majority decisions which were profoundly disadvantageous and dangerous to his own interests (such as his appointment to the Treaty negotiating team).\n\n==Commemoration==\n[[File:Grave of Miche\u00e1l \u00d3 Coile\u00e1in.jpg|left|thumb|Memorial cross at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th.]]\nAn annual commemoration ceremony takes place each year in August at the ambush site at [[B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th]], County Cork, organised by The B\u00e9al na mBl\u00e1th Commemoration Committee.

Selections have been published in ''The Path to Freedom'' (Mercier, 1968) and in ''Michael Collins in His Own Words'' (Gill & Macmillan, 1997). In the 1960s, Taoiseach Se\u00e1n Lemass, himself a veteran of the 1916 Rising and War of Independence, credited Collins's ideas as the basis for his successes in revitalizing Ireland's economy.\n\nNine years after his death, the UK Parliament passed the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which removed virtually all of London's remaining authority over the Free State and the other dominions. This had the effect of making the Free State the first internationally recognised independent Irish state, thus fulfilling Collins' vision of having \"the freedom to achieve freedom.\"\n\n==Societies==\nThe '''Collins 22 Society''' established in 2002 is an international organisation dedicated to keeping the name and legacy of Michael Collins in living memory. The patron of the society is Ireland's former Minister for Justice and TD [[Nora Owen]], grand-niece of Michael Collins.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:Bust of Michael Collins at Merrion Square Park, Dublin, Ireland..JPG|left|thumb|Bust of Michael Collins at Merrion Square Park, Dublin, Ireland.]]\nThe 1936 film ''[[Beloved Enemy]]'' is a fictionalised account of Collins's life. Unlike the real Michael Collins, the fictionalised \"Dennis Riordan\" (played by [[Brian Aherne]]) is shot, but recovers. ''[[Hang Up Your Brightest Colours]]'', a British [[documentary film|documentary]] by [[Kenneth Griffith]], was made for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1973, but refused transmission. It was eventually screened by the [[BBC]] in [[Wales]] in 1993 and across the United Kingdom the following year.\n\nIn 1969, [[Dominic Behan]] wrote an episode of the UK television series [[Play for today]] entitled 'Michael Collins'. The play dealt with Collins' attempt to take the gun out of Irish politics and took the perspective of the Republican argument. At the time of writing the script, [[the troubles]] had just begun in Northern Ireland and the [[BBC]] were reluctant to broadcast the production. An appeal by the author to [[David Attenborough]] (Director of Programming for the BBC at that time) resulted in the play eventually being broadcast; Attenborough took the view that the imperatives of free speech could not be compromised in the cause of political expediency.\n\nAn [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] documentary made by Colm Connolly for [[RT\u00c9 Television]] in 1989 called ''The Shadow of B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th'' covered Collins's death. A made-for-TV film, ''[[The Treaty (film)|The Treaty]]'', was produced in 1991 and starred [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Collins and [[Ian Bannen]] as [[David Lloyd George]].

Collins's great-grandnephew, Aengus O'Malley, played a student in a scene filmed in [[Marsh's Library]].\n\nIn 2005 [[Cork Opera House]] commissioned a musical drama about Collins.<ref>[http://www.corkoperahouse.ie/musicals/Old_Musical_Files/michael_collins_a%20_musical_drama.php Cork Opera House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415160923/http://corkoperahouse.ie/musicals/Old_Musical_Files/michael_collins_a%20_musical_drama.php |date=15 April 2009 }}</ref> \"Michael Collins\" by Brian Flynn had a successful run in 2009 at Cork opera house and later in the [[Olympia Theatre, Dublin|Olympia Theatre]] in Dublin.\n\n''[[Infamous Assassinations]]'', a 2007 British documentary television series, devoted its eighth episode to the death of Collins.\n\nThe 2016 miniseries, ''[[Rebellion (miniseries)|Rebellion]]'', focused on the 1916 Easter Rising. Collins appeared as a background character, taking part in the uprising, played by Sebastian Thommen.\n\nCollins was portrayed by Gavin Drea in the 2019 sequel to Rebellion, [[Resistance (miniseries)|Resistance]].\n\n===Songs===\n[[File:Wax figure of Michael Collins at the National Wax Plus Museum, Dublin, Ireland..JPG|right|thumb|Wax figure of Michael Collins at the [[National Wax Plus Museum]], Dublin, Ireland.]]\nIrish-American [[folk rock]] band [[Black 47]] recorded a song entitled \"[[The Big Fellah]]\" which was the first track on their 1994 album ''Home of the Brave''. It details Collins's career, from the [[Easter Rising]] to his death at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th. Irish [[Folk music|folk]] band the [[Wolfe Tones]] recorded a song titled \"Michael Collins\" on ''[[A Sense of Freedom (album)|A Sense of Freedom]]'' (1983) about Collins's life and death, although it begins when he was about 16 and took a job in London. Celtic metal band [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]] recorded a song also titled \"Michael Collins\" on their 2004 album ''[[Pagan (album)|Pagan]]'' which dealt with his role in the Civil War, the treaty and his eventual death. Also a song by [[Johnny McEvoy]], simply named \"Michael\", depicts Collins's death and the sadness surrounding his funeral.\n\nThe poem \"The laughing boy\" by [[Brendan Behan]] lamenting the death of Collins was translated into Greek in 1961 by Vasilis Rotas. In October of the same year, [[Mikis Theodorakis]] composed the song \"T\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03af\" (\"The laughing boy\") using Rotas' translation. The song was recorded by [[Maria Farantouri]] in 1966 on the album \"\u0388\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" (\"The hostage\") and became an instant success. It was the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'' (1969). \"The laughing boy\" became the song of protest against the [[dictatorship in Greece]] (1967\u20131974) and remains to date one of the most popular songs in Greek popular culture.\n\n===Plays===\nJournalist Eamonn O'Neill wrote the play ''God Save Ireland Cried the Hero'' about Collins' last night alive. Set in his hotel room, the one-man production started Liam Brennan in the role of Collins and was produced by the Wiseguise Company. It was performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cooper |first1=Neil |title=Edinburgh Festival: God Save Ireland Cried The Hero |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/fringe-round-up-5602596.html |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=Independent |date=30  August 1996}}</ref>\n\n[[Mary Kenny]] wrote a play ''Allegiance'', about a meeting between [[Winston Churchill]] and Michael Collins.

He moved to London in 1906, to become a clerk in the [[Post Office Savings Bank]] at [[Blythe House]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He was a member of the [[London GAA]], through which he became associated with the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] and the [[Gaelic League]]. He returned to Ireland in 1916 and fought in the [[Easter Rising]]. He was subsequently imprisoned in the [[Frongoch internment camp]] as a [[prisoner of war]], but was released in December 1916.\n\nCollins rose through the ranks of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] after his release from Frongoch. He became a [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] for [[South Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cork]] in [[1918 Irish general election|1918]], and was appointed [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] in the [[First D\u00e1il]]. He was present when the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il]] convened on 21 January 1919 and [[Irish Declaration of Independence|declared the independence]] of the [[Irish Republic]]. In the ensuing [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]], he was Director of Organisation and Adjutant General for the Irish Volunteers, and Director of Intelligence of the [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|Irish Republican Army]]. He gained fame as a [[guerrilla warfare]] strategist, planning and directing many successful attacks on British forces, such as the [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|\"Bloody Sunday\" assassinations]] of key British intelligence agents in November 1920.\n\nAfter the July 1921 ceasefire, Collins and [[Arthur Griffith]] were sent to London by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] to negotiate peace terms. The resulting [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] established the [[Irish Free State]] but depended on an [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] to [[the Crown]], a condition with which de Valera and other republican leaders had difficulty reconciling. Collins viewed the treaty as offering \"the freedom to achieve freedom\", and persuaded a majority in the [[Second D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il]] to ratify the treaty. A [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|provisional government]] was formed under his [[Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|chairmanship]] in early 1922 but was soon disrupted by the [[Irish Civil War]], in which Collins was [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]].

Collins is fifth from the right with an 'x' over his head.]]\n\nThe struggle for [[Irish Home Rule movement|Home Rule]], along with labour unrest, had led to the formation in 1913 of two major nationalist paramilitary groups who later launched the [[Easter Rising]]: the [[Irish Citizen Army]] was established by [[James Connolly]], [[James Larkin]] and his [[Irish Transport and General Workers Union]] (ITGWU) to protect strikers from the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] during the [[1913 Dublin Lockout]]. The [[Irish Volunteers]] were created in the same year by nationalists in response to the formation of the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF), an [[Ulster loyalist]] body pledged to oppose Home Rule by force.\n\nAn organiser of considerable intelligence, Collins had become highly respected in the IRB. This led to his appointment as financial advisor to [[George Noble Plunkett|Count Plunkett]], father of one of the [[Easter Rising]]'s organisers, [[Joseph Plunkett]]. Collins took part in preparing arms and drilling troops for the insurrection.\n\nThe Rising was Collins' first appearance in national events. When it commenced on [[Easter Monday]] 1916, Collins served as Joseph Plunkett's aide-de-camp at the rebellion's headquarters in the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]] (GPO) in [[Dublin]]. There he fought alongside [[Patrick Pearse]], James Connolly, and other members of the Rising leadership. The Rising was put down after six days, but the insurgents achieved their goal of holding their positions for the minimum time required to justify a claim to independence under international criteria.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first= Kathleen|title=Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman|publisher=Dublin: O'Brien Press Ltd |year=2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Collins was arrested and taken into British custody. He was processed at Dublin's [[Richmond Barracks]] by \"[[G Division (Dublin Metropolitan Police)|G-Men]]\", plain-clothes officers from [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]]. During his screening, Collins was identified as someone who should be selected for further interrogation, harsher treatment, or execution. However, he overheard his name being called out so he moved to the other side of the building to identify the speaker. In doing so, he joined the group that was transferred to [[Frongoch internment camp]] in Wales, a movement that historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] describes as \"one of the luckiest escapes of his life.\"<ref name=\"TP\">{{cite book|authorlink=Tim Pat Coogan|first= Tim Pat|last=Coogan|title=Michael Collins: A Biography|page= 50|publisher=Arrow|year=2015|isbn= 978-1784753269}}</ref>\n\nCollins first began to emerge as a major figure in the vacuum created by the executions of the 1916 leadership. He began hatching plans for \"next time\" even before the prison ships left Dublin.<ref>{{citebook|first= Margery|last= Forester|quote= Nancy O'Brien cousin of Michael Collins|title=The Lost Leader|publisher= Gill & MacMillan, Limited|year= 2006|isbn= 978-0717140145}}</ref>\n\nAt Frongoch he was one of the organisers of a program of protest and non-cooperation with authorities, similar to that later carried on by IRA internees in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s. The camp proved an excellent opportunity for networking with [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical-force republicans]] from all over the country, of which he became a key organiser.<ref name=\"TP\"/><ref>Teilifl\u00eds Gaeltachta / Radio Teilifl\u00eda \u00c9ireann \"An gCoilaiste R\u00e9abhloid\" 2010</ref>\n\nWhile some celebrated the fact that a rising had happened at all, believing in Pearse's theory of \"blood sacrifice\" (namely that the deaths of the Rising's leaders would inspire others), Collins railed against the military blunders made, such as the seizure of indefensible and very vulnerable positions like [[St Stephen's Green]], which were impossible to escape from and difficult to supply. Public outcry placed pressure on the British government to end the internment. In December 1916, the Frongoch prisoners were sent home.\n\n==1917\u20131918==\nBefore his death, [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], first signatory of the 1916 Proclamation and widely considered the Rising's foremost organiser, had designated his wife [[Kathleen Clarke]] as the official caretaker of Rising official business, in the event that the leadership did not survive. By June 1916, Mrs. Clarke had sent out the first post-Rising communiqu\u00e9 to the IRB, declaring the Rising to be only the beginning and directing nationalists to prepare for \"the next blow.\" Soon after his release Mrs. Clarke appointed Collins Secretary to the National Aid and Volunteers Dependents Fund (NAVDF) and subsequently passed on to him the secret organisational information and contacts which she had held in trust for the independence movement.\n\n[[File:Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith.jpg|right|upright=1.35|thumb|Michael Collins and [[Arthur Griffith]]]]\n\nCollins became one of the leading figures in the post-Rising independence movement spearheaded by [[Arthur Griffith]], editor/publisher of the main [[nationalist]] newspaper [[The United Irishman]], (which Collins had read avidly as a boy.)<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\">Coogan, TP. ''Michael Collins'', 1990</ref> Griffith's organisation [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] had been founded in 1905 as an umbrella group to unify all the various factions within the nationalist movement.\n\nUnder Griffith's policy, Collins and other advocates of the \"physical-force\" approach to independence gained the cooperation of non-violent Sinn F\u00e9in, while agreeing to disagree with Griffith's moderate ideas of a [[dual monarchy]] solution based on the Hungarian model.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Feeney, Brian. ''Sinn Fein: a Hundred Turbulent Years'', Dublin; O'Brien Press Ltd., 2002</ref> The British government and mainstream Irish media had wrongly blamed Sinn F\u00e9in for the Rising. This attracted Rising participants to join the organisation in order to exploit the reputation with which such British propaganda had imbued the organisation. By October 1917 Collins had risen to become a member of the executive of Sinn F\u00e9in and director of organisation for the [[Irish Volunteers]]. [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], another veteran of 1916, stood for the presidency of Sinn F\u00e9in against Griffith, who stepped aside and supported de Valera's presidency.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n==First D\u00e1il==\n[[File:First dail restoration3.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|''Members of the First D\u00e1il'' <br /> First row, left to right: [[Laurence Ginnell]], Michael Collins, [[Cathal Brugha]], [[Arthur Griffith]], [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], [[George Noble Plunkett|Count Plunkett]], [[Eoin MacNeill]], [[W.

Like many senior Sinn F\u00e9in representatives Collins was elected as an MP (for [[South Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|Cork South]]) with the right to sit in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in London. Unlike their rivals in the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP), Sinn F\u00e9in MPs had announced that they would not take their seats in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] but instead would set up an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in Dublin.<ref name=\"elecs_irl\">{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=6695|title=Michael Collins|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nBefore the new body's first meeting, Collins, tipped off by his network of spies, warned his colleagues of plans to arrest all its members in overnight raids. De Valera and others ignored the warnings on the argument that, if the arrests happened, they would constitute a [[propaganda]] coup. The intelligence proved accurate and de Valera, along with Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who followed his advice, were arrested; Collins and others evaded incarceration.\n\nThe new parliament, called [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (meaning \"Assembly of Ireland\", see [[First D\u00e1il]]) met in the [[Mansion House, Dublin]] in January 1919. In de Valera's absence, [[Cathal Brugha]] was elected [[Pr\u00edomh Aire]] ('First' or 'Prime' Minister but often translated as 'President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann'). The following April, Collins engineered de Valera's escape from [[Lincoln (HM Prison)|Lincoln Prison]] in England, after which Brugha was replaced by de Valera.\n\nNo [[Nation state|state]] gave diplomatic recognition to the 1919 Republic, despite sustained lobbying in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] by de Valera and prominent [[Irish-Americans]] and at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris peace conference]]. In January 1919 the D\u00e1il ratified the [[Irish Republican Army]]'s (IRA) claim to be the army of the [[Irish Republic]]. The IRA had begun a military campaign coincidentally on the same day as the D\u00e1il's first sitting with the [[Soloheadbeg Ambush]], and the IRA's respect for the D\u00e1il's authority was highly conditional. (The Irish Volunteers began to be referred to as the IRA since their internment at Frongoch. Up until the Civil War, the two terms were used interchangeably.)\n\n==Minister for Finance==\nDe Valera appointed Collins as [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] in the [[Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] in 1919.<ref>Mackay, p. 116</ref> Most of the ministries existed only on paper or as one or two people working in a room of a private house, given the circumstances of war in which they were liable to be arrested or killed by the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], [[British Army]], [[Black and Tans]] or [[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]].\n\nDespite that, Collins managed to produce a Finance Ministry that was able to organise a large bond issue in the form of a \"National Loan\" to fund the new Irish Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://generalmichaelcollins.com/National_Loan/National_Loan_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515172519/http://generalmichaelcollins.com/National_Loan/National_Loan_1.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }} Collins 22 Society Page on \"The National Loan 1920\"</ref> According to [[Batt O'Connor]], the D\u00e1il Loan raised almost \u00a3400,000, of which \u00a325,000 was in gold.

The two policemen were shot dead during the engagement. This ambush is considered the first action in the Irish War of Independence.<ref>Breen, Dan. ''My Fight For Irish Freedom'', Dublin, Talbot Press 1924</ref> The engagement had no advance authorisation from the nascent government.

That summer he was elected president of the IRB (and therefore, in the doctrine of that organisation, {{lang|la|de jure}} President of the Irish Republic). In September, he was made Director of [[espionage|Intelligence]] for the [[Irish Republican Army]] which now had a mandate to pursue an armed campaign, as the official military of the Irish nation. With [[Cathal Brugha]] as Minister of Defence, Collins became Director of Organisation and Adjutant General of the Volunteers. Collins spent much of this period helping to organise the Volunteers as an effective military force, and concentrating on forcing the RIC&nbsp;\u2013 which represented British authority in Ireland&nbsp;\u2013 out of isolated barracks and seizing their weapons.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|title=The Roots and Consequences of 20th-Century Warfare: Conflicts that Shaped the Modern World|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1610698023|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3nEDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA97|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> Collins was determined to avoid the massive destruction, military and civilian losses for merely symbolic victories that had characterised the 1916 Rising. Instead, he directed a guerrilla war against the British, suddenly attacking then just as quickly withdrawing, minimising losses and maximising effectiveness.<ref>Michael Collins, personal correspondence 1916\u201317</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceE\">Barry, Tom. ''Guerrilla Days in Ireland'', Dublin, Irish Press 1949</ref>\n\nThe Crown responded with escalation of the war, with the importation of special forces such as the \"[[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]]\", the \"[[Black and Tans]]\", the \"[[Cairo Gang]]\", and others. Officially or unofficially, many of these groups were given a free hand to institute a reign of terror, shooting Irish people indiscriminately, invading homes, looting and burning.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>[[Kathleen Clarke|Clarke, Kathleen]]. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'', O'Brien Press 2008</ref>\n\nAs the war began in earnest, de Valera travelled to the United States for an extended speaking tour to raise funds for the outlawed Republican government. It was in publicity for this tour that de Valera (who had been elected [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|Pr\u00edomh Aire]] by the D\u00e1il) was first referred to as \"President\". While financially successful, grave political conflicts followed in de Valera's wake there which threatened the unity of Irish-American support for the rebels. Some members of the IRB also objected to the use of the presidential title because their organisation's constitution had a different definition of that title.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref>Clarke, Kathleen. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'', Dublin O'Brien Press Ltd 2008</ref>\n\nBack in Ireland, Collins arranged the \"National Loan\", organised the IRA, effectively led the government, and managed arms-smuggling operations. Local guerrilla units received supplies, training and had largely a free hand to develop the war in their own region. These were the \"flying columns\" who comprised the bulk of the War of Independence rank and file in the south-west. Collins, [[Dick McKee]] and regional commanders such as [[Dan Breen]] and [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] oversaw tactics and general strategy. There were also regional organisers, such as Ernie O'Malley and Liam Mellows, who reported directly to Collins at St Ita's secret basement GHQ in central Dublin.<ref>E O'Malley.

''Florence and Josephine O'Donoghue's War of Independence'', Dublin, Irish Academic Press, 2006</ref>\n[[File:General Collins.jpg|upright|thumb|Collins inspects a soldier.]]\nIt was at this time that Collins created a special [[assassination]] unit called [[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|The Squad]] expressly to kill British agents and informers. Collins was criticised for these tactics but cited the universal war-time practice of executing enemy spies who were, in his words, \"hunting victims for execution.\" Campaigning for Irish independence, even non-violently, was still targeted both by prosecutions under British law entailing the death penalty and also by extrajudicial killings such as that of [[Tomas MacCurtain]], nationalist mayor of Cork City.\n\nIn 1920 the British offered [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]10,000 (equivalent to GB\u00a3300,000 / \u20ac360,000 in 2010) for information leading to Collins' capture or death. He evaded capture and continued to strike against British forces, often operating from safe-houses near government buildings, such as Vaughan's and [[An Stad]].\n\nIn 1920, following Westminster's prominent announcements that it had the Irish insurgents on the run, Collins and his Squad killed several British secret service agents in a series of coordinated raids. In retaliation, members of the Royal Irish Constabulary went to Croke Park, where a G.A.A. football match was taking place between Dublin and Tipperary. The police officers opened fire on the crowd, killing twelve and wounding sixty.  This event became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]]. A stampede of panicking British operatives sought the shelter of [[Dublin Castle]] next day. About the same time, Tom Barry's 3rd Cork Brigade took no prisoners in a bitter battle with British forces at [[Kilmichael Ambush|Kilmichael]]. In many regions, the RIC and other crown forces became all but confined to the strongest barracks in the larger towns as rural areas came increasingly under rebel control.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/><ref>[[Neligan, David]]. ''The Spy In the Castle'', London, Prendeville Publishing 1999</ref>\n\nThese republican victories would have been impossible without widespread support from the Irish population, which included every level of society and reached deep into the British administration in Ireland. This pattern of guerrilla success against sophisticated imperialist powers was repeated around the world in the early 20th century.<ref>[[Deasy, Liam]]. ''Brother Against Brother'', Cork, Mercier 1982</ref>\n\nAt the time of the ceasefire in July 1921 a major operation was allegedly in planning to execute every British secret service agent in Dublin, while a major ambush involving eighty officers and men was also planned for [[Templeglantine]], County Limerick.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"generalmichaelcollins.com\">[http://generalmichaelcollins.com/Michael_Collins_Life_and_Times/8.THE_TRUCE.html Page at generalmichaelcollins.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515210232/http://generalmichaelcollins.com/Michael_Collins_Life_and_Times/8.THE_TRUCE.html |date=15 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Truce==\nIn 1921 General Macready, commander of British forces in Ireland, reported to his government that the Empire's only hope of holding Ireland was by martial law, including the suspension of \"all normal life.\"<ref>''Wilson Diaries'', Vol II p. 293</ref> Westminster's foreign policy ruled out this option: Irish-American public opinion was important to British agendas in Asia. In addition, Britain's efforts at a military solution had already resulted in a powerful peace movement, which demanded an end to the unrest in Ireland. Prominent voices calling for negotiation included the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], ''[[The Times]]'' and other leading periodicals, members of the [[House of Lords]], [[English Catholics]], and famous authors such as [[George Bernard Shaw]].<ref>Cabinet Office, (Westminster government) London</ref><ref>British Cabinet minutes, 1921</ref>\n\nStill, it was not the British government that initiated negotiations. Individual English activists, including clergy, made private overtures which reached Arthur Griffith. Griffith expressed his welcome for dialogue. The British MP [[Brigadier General Cockerill]] sent an open letter to Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] that was printed in the Times, outlining how a peace conference with the Irish should be organised. The Pope made an urgent public appeal for a negotiated end to the violence. Whether or not Lloyd George welcomed such advisors, he could no longer hold out against this tide.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/>\n\nIn July, Lloyd George's government [[Irish War of Independence#Truce: July\u2013December 1921|offered a truce]]. Arrangements were made for a conference between British government and the leaders of the yet-unrecognised Republic. There remains uncertainty as to the two sides' capability to have carried on the conflict much longer. Collins told Hamar Greenwood after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty: \"You had us dead beat. We could not have lasted another three weeks. When we were told of the offer of a truce we were astonished. We thought you must have gone mad\".<ref>L. S. Amery, ''My Political Life.

''Brother Against Brother''</ref>\n\nHowever, the D\u00e1il as a whole was less uncompromising. It decided to proceed to a peace conference, although it was ascertained in the preliminary stages that a fully independent republic would not be on the table and that the loss of some northeastern counties was a foregone conclusion.<ref>Phoenix, Eamonn.

''No Other Law'', Dublin, Irish Press 1954</ref>\n\nDe Valera was widely acknowledged as the most skillful negotiator on the D\u00e1il government side and he participated in the initial parlays, agreeing the basis on which talks could begin. The first meetings were held in strict secrecy soon after the Customs House battle, with Andrew Cope representing Dublin Castle's British authorities. Later, de Valera travelled to London for the first official contact with Lloyd George. The two met one-on-one in a private meeting, the proceedings of which have never been revealed.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceG\">Neligan, David.

''The IRA: A History'', p. 76</ref> Not long after, the Cabinet was obliged to select the delegation that would travel to the London peace conference and negotiate a treaty.

(He had kept his public visibility to a minimum during the conduct of the war; up to this time the British still had very few reliable photographs of him.)<ref name=\"ReferenceH\">O'Connor, Batt. ''With Michael Collins in the Fight For Irish Independence'', 1929</ref> The Cabinet of seven split on the issue, with de Valera casting the deciding vote. Many of Collins's associates warned him not to go, that he was being set up as a political scapegoat. Following intense soul-searching and all-night consultations with his most trusted advisors, he resolved to attend \"in the spirit of a soldier obeying orders.\" In private correspondence he foresaw the catastrophe ahead: \"Let them make a scapegoat or whatever they like of me. Someone must go.\"\n\n==Anglo-Irish Treaty==\n[[File:Michael Collins 1921.jpg|right|thumb|Collins in [[London]] as delegate to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] negotiations.]]\nThe Irish delegates to London were designated as \"plenipotentiaries\", meaning that they had full authority to sign an agreement on behalf of the D\u00e1il government. The Treaty would then be subject to approval by the D\u00e1il.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Jeremy|title=Britain and Ireland: From Home Rule to Independence|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317884934|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbqOAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA128|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> The majority of the delegates, including [[Arthur Griffith]] (leader), [[Robert Barton]] and [[Eamonn Duggan]] (with [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]] as Secretary General to the delegation) set up headquarters at 22 [[Hans Place]] in [[Knightsbridge]] on 11 October 1921. Collins shared quarters at 15 Cadogan Gardens with the delegation's publicity department, secretary [[Diarmuid O'Hegarty]], [[Joseph McGrath (Irish politician)|Joseph McGrath]] as well as substantial intelligence and bodyguard personnel including [[Liam Tobin]], Tom Cullen, [[Eamon Broy|Ned Broy]], [[Emmet Dalton]] and Joseph Dolan of [[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|The Squad]].<ref>Mackay, p. 217</ref>\n\nThe British team were led by their Prime Minister Lloyd George, the Colonial Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] and [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|F. E. Smith]]. During two months of arduous negotiations the Irish delegates made frequent crossings between London and Dublin to confer with their D\u00e1il colleagues, and Collins's correspondence reflects his frustration at D\u00e1il debates and the Irish delegate's inability to agree clear instruction as to whether or not they should accept a treaty.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins''</ref> \n\nIn November, with the London peace talks still in progress, Collins attended a large meeting of regional IRA commanders at Parnell Place in Dublin. In a private conference he informed [[Liam Deasy]], [[Florence O'Donoghue]] and [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] that there would have to be some compromise in the current negotiations in London. \"There was no question of our getting all the demands we were making.\" He was advised by Lynch not to bring this out in the full assembly. Reviewing subsequent events, Deasy later doubted the wisdom of that advice.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> \n\nThe negotiations ultimately resulted in the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] which was signed on 6 December 1921. The agreement provided for a [[Dominion]] status \"[[Irish Free State]]\", whose relationship to the British [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] would be modelled after Canada's. This was a compromise, half-way between an independent republic and a province of the Empire. The Treaty was signed under considerable pressure from the British. The negotiators had agreed at the cabinet meeting in Dublin that they would not sign the Treaty without bringing it back for the Dail cabinet to ratify. But once back in London on December 5th at 7:30 pm, Lloyd George told them it was immediate signature or 'immediate and terrible war' and that he had to know by the next day. The Treaty was signed at 2:20 am, December 6, 1921. <ref>Frank Pakenham, Peace by Ordeal, (1972) p.245-247</ref>\n\nThe settlement overturned the Act of Union by recognising the native Irish legislature's independence. Under a [[bicameral parliament]], executive authority would remain vested in the king, represented in Ireland by a [[Governor General]], but exercised by an Irish government elected by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as a \"[[lower house]]\". British forces would depart the Free State forthwith and be replaced by an Irish army. Along with an independent judiciary, the Treaty granted the new Free State greater [[independence]] than any Irish state, and went well beyond the Home Rule which had been sought by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] or by his [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] successors John Redmond and John Dillon.\n\nThe Treaty acknowledged the partition of Ireland. Before Treaty negotiations had concluded, executive powers had already been passed to the government of [[Northern Ireland]] created under the [[Government of Ireland Act]] in 1920. <ref>Ronan, Fanning, The Fatal Path, British Government and Irish Revolution 1910-1922, p288</ref> Northern Ireland, which had a majority [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] population, could opt out of the Free State, a year after the signing of the Treaty. An [[Irish Boundary Commission]] was to be established to draw a border, 'in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants' and \u2018economic and geographic conditions\u2019.<ref>Liam Weeks, Michael O Fatharthaigh, The Treaty, p.279</ref> Collins anticipated a redrawing of the border would result in much of the south and west of Northern Ireland becoming part of the Free State, making Northern Ireland economically non-viable,and facilitating the reunification of the 32 counties in the near future.<ref>Phoenix, Eamonn. ''Michael Collins \u2013 The Northern Question 1916\u201322'', in. ''Michael Collins and the Making of the Irish State'', (Doherty & Keogh, editors)</ref>\n\nCollins argued that he had signed the Treaty as the alternative was a war that the Irish people did not want. 'I say that rejection of the Treaty is a declaration of war until you have beaten the British Empire, apart from any alternative document. Rejection of the Treaty means your national policy is war.... The Treaty was signed by me, not because they held up the alternative of immediate war. I signed it because I would not be one of those to commit the Irish people to war without the Irish people committing themselves to war'. <ref>Dail Debate on Treaty 19 December 1921, https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-12-19/2/</ref>  While the Treaty fell short of the republic for which he had fought, Collins concluded that the Treaty offered Ireland \"not the freedom that all nations desire and develop to, but the freedom to achieve it.\" .<ref>Collins, Michael. ''The Path To Freedom'', Cork, Mercier 1968</ref> \n\nNonetheless, he knew that elements of the Treaty would cause controversy in Ireland. Upon signing the treaty, F. E. Smith remarked \"I may have signed my political death warrant tonight\". Collins replied \"I may have signed my actual death warrant\".<ref name=\"generalmichaelcollins.com\" />\n\n===Treaty debates===\n\nThis remark encapsulated his acknowledgement that the Treaty was a compromise that would be vulnerable to charges of \"sell-out\" from purist Republicans. It did not establish the fully independent republic that Collins himself had shortly before demanded as a non-negotiable condition. The \"physical force republicans\" who made up the bulk of the army which had fought the British to a draw would be loath to accept dominion status within the [[British Empire]] or an [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] that mentioned the King. Also controversial was the British retention of [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]] on the south coast of Ireland for the [[Royal Navy]]. These factors diminished Irish sovereignty and threatened to allow British interference in Ireland's foreign policy. Collins and Griffith were well aware of these issues and strove tenaciously, against British resistance, to achieve language which could be accepted by all constituents. They succeeded in obtaining an oath to the Irish Free State, with a subsidiary oath of fidelity to the King, rather than to the king unilaterally.\n\nEamon De Valera, the President of the Dail objected to the Treaty on the grounds that it had been signed without cabinet consent and that it secured neither the full independence of Ireland nor Irish unity. <ref>Frank Pakenham, Peace by Ordeal, (1972), p209-211</ref> Collins and his supporters argued that de Valera had refused strenuous pleas from Collins, Griffith and others to lead the London negotiations in person. He had  refused the delegates' continual requests for instruction, and in fact had been at the centre of the original decision to enter negotiations without the possibility of an independent republic on the table.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceI\">O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins'', Dublin, Gill & MacMillan 1980</ref>\n\nThe Treaty controversy split the entire nationalist movement. Sinn F\u00e9in, the D\u00e1il, the IRB and the army each divided into pro- and anti-Treaty factions. The Supreme Council of the IRB had been informed in detail about every facet of the Treaty negotiations and had approved many of its provisions, and they voted unanimously to accept the Treaty with the single notable exception of [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]], later COS of the anti-Treaty IRA.<ref>Coogan, ''Michael Collins'', pp. 236\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe D\u00e1il debated the Treaty bitterly for ten days until it was approved by a vote of 64 to 57.<ref>[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E900003-001/ Debate on the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland...] from University College Cork</ref> Having lost this vote, de Valera announced his intent to withdraw his participation from the D\u00e1il and called on all deputies who had voted against the Treaty to follow him. A substantial number did so, officially splitting the government.\n\nA large part of the Irish Republican Army opposed the Treaty and in March 1922 voted at an Army Convention to reject the authority of the Dail, Collins' GHQ and to elect their own Executive. Anti-Treaty IRA units began to seize buildings and take other guerrilla actions against the Provisional Government. On 14 April 1922, a group of 200 anti-Treaty IRA men occupied the Four Courts in Dublin under [[Rory O'Connor (Irish republican)|Rory O'Connor]], a hero of the War of Independence. The [[Four Courts]] was the centre of the Irish courts system, originally under the British and then the Free State. Collins was charged by his Free State colleagues with putting down these insurgents, however, he resisted firing on former comrades and staved off a shooting war throughout this period.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\">Provisional Government minutes, Public Records Office, Dublin</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceK\">O'Donoghue, Florence. ''No Other Law'', Dublin, Irish Press, 1954</ref>\n\nWhile the country teetered on the edge of civil war, continuous meetings were carried on among the various factions from January to June 1922. In these discussions the nationalists strove to resolve the issue without armed conflict. Collins and his close associate, [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) [[Harry Boland]] were among those who worked desperately to heal the rift.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>Fitzpatrick, David. ''Harry Boland's Irish Revolution'', Cork, Cork University Press, 2003</ref>\n\nTo foster military unity, Collins and the IRB established an \"army re-unification committee\", including delegates from pro- and anti-Treaty factions. The still-secret Irish Republican Brotherhood continued to meet, fostering dialogue between pro- and anti-Treaty IRA officers. In the IRB's stormy debates on the subject, Collins held out the Constitution of the new Free State as a possible solution. Collins was then in the process of co-writing that document and was striving to make it a republican constitution that included provisions that would allow anti-Treaty TDs to take their seats in good conscience, without any oath concerning the Crown.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/>\n\n==Northern Ireland==\n\nCollins' policy toward Northern Ireland was ambiguous. He told the Dail during the Treaty debates that, 'We have stated we would not coerce the North-East ... Surely we recognise that the North-East corner does exist, and surely our intention was that we should take such steps as would sooner or later lead to mutual understanding. The Treaty has made an effort to deal with it .. on lines that will lead very rapidly to goodwill, and the entry of the North-East under the Irish Parliament. I don't say it is an ideal arrangement, but if our policy is, as has been stated, a policy of non-coercion'. <ref>Dail Debate on Treaty 19 December 1921, https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-12-19/2/</ref>\n\nHowever he told the Northern Divisions of the IRA in private, early in 1922 that, \u2018although the Treaty may have seemed as an outward expression of partition, the [Provisional Irish] Government plans to make it [partition] impossible\u2026even if it meant smashing the Treaty\u2019. <ref>Donnacha O Beachain, From Partition to Brexit, The Irish Government and Northern Ireland, 2019, p. 13 </ref> Collins' Provisional Government also funded county councils and paid the salaries of teachers in Northern Ireland who recognised the Free State.\n\nIn Northern Ireland in the first half of 1922, there was considerable violence between rival forces along he new border, the IRA on the southern side and the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] on the Northern side. There were also many killings of civilians, notably by \"unauthorised loyalist paramilitary forces\" who targeted Catholics. Catholic were also driven out of their jobs, notably in Belfast's shipyards.\n\nIn March, Collins met [[Sir James Craig]], Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, in London. They signed an agreement declaring peace in the north which promised cooperation between Catholics and Protestants in policing and security, a generous budget for restoring Catholics to homes which had been destroyed, and many other measures.<ref>British Cabinet Office</ref> The day after the agreement was published, violence erupted again. A policeman was shot dead in Belfast and in reprisal, police entered Catholic homes nearby and shot residents in their beds, including children. There was no response to Collins's demands for an inquiry. He and his Cabinet warned that they would deem the agreement broken unless Craig took action.<ref>MC official correspondence, 5 and 10 April 1922</ref> In his continual correspondence with Churchill over violence in the north, Collins protested repeatedly that such breaches of the Truce threatened to invalidate the Treaty entirely.<ref>Michael Collins letter to Churchill 6 June 1922</ref> The prospect was real enough that on 3 June 1922 Churchill presented to the Committee of Imperial Defence his plans \"to protect Ulster from invasion by the South.\"<ref>British Cabinet minutes 16/42 Public Records Office, London</ref>\n\nThroughout the early months of 1922, Collins had been sending IRA units to the border and sending arms and money to the northern units of the IRA. Collins joined other IRB and IRA leadership in developing secret plans to launch a clandestine guerrilla war in the northeast. Some British arms that had been supplied to the Provisional government in Dublin were turned over by Collins to IRA units in the north. In May\u2013June 1922 Collins and IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch organised an offensive that would involve mobilising and arming ''both'' pro- and anti-Treaty IRA units along the border area.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-44083967 BBC Northern Ireland]</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Derrig |first1=Mick |title=Michael Collins' Unfinished Revolution |url=https://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/5476 |accessdate=12 June 2019 |work=An Phoblacht |date=21 October 1999}}</ref> Because of this, most northern IRA units supported Collins and 524 individual volunteers came south to join the National Army in the Irish Civil War.\n\nThis activity was supposed to culminate in a 'joint Northern offensive' in May 1922 that was to involve both pro and anti-Treaty IRA units. However, it appears that Collins countermanded the offensive at the last minute. While the Northern units took part, the Divisions based in southern territory and under Collins' authority, the 1st, 4th and 5th Northern Divisions did not, leading to the suppression of the offensive with relative ease by the Northern authorities.<ref> [https://www.theirishstory.com/2019/08/12/michael-collins-northern-ireland-and-the-northern-offensive-may-1922/#.Xl0rwPTgrIV Patrick Concannon, Michael Collins, Northern Ireland and the Northern Offensive, May 1922, The Irish Story August 2019.

Accessed March 2020]</ref>\n\nAt the time of his death in August 1922, it was still unclear what Collins' true intentions towards Northern Ireland were.\n\n==Provisional government==\n[[File:Michael Collins addressing crowd in Cork cph.3b15295.jpg|left|thumb|Michael Collins addresses a crowd in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], 1922.]]\nDe Valera resigned the presidency and sought re-election but Arthur Griffith replaced him after a close vote on 9 January 1922. Griffith chose as his title President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, rather than President of the Republic as de Valera had favoured.<ref>Younger, Calton. ''Arthur Griffith'', Dublin, Gill & Macmillan 1981</ref> The D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann government did not hold legal status in British [[constitutional law]]. The provisions of the Treaty required the formation of a ''new'' government, which would be recognised by Westminster as pertaining to the Free State dominion that had been established by the Treaty. Despite the abdication of a large part of the D\u00e1il, the [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government (Rialtas Sealadach na h\u00c9ireann)]] was formed by Arthur Griffith as President and Michael Collins as Chairman of the Cabinet (effectively [[Prime Minister]]). Collins retained his position as Minister for Finance.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\"/>\n\nIn British legal tradition, Collins was now a Crown-appointed prime minister of a Commonwealth state, installed under the [[Royal Prerogative]]. To be so installed he had to formally meet the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] [[Edmund FitzAlan-Howard, 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent|Viscount FitzAlan]] the head of the British administration in Ireland. The republican view of the same meeting is that Collins met FitzAlan to accept the surrender of [[Dublin Castle]], the official seat of British government in Ireland. Having surrendered, FitzAlan still remained in place as viceroy until December 1922.\n\nThe Provisional Government's first obligation was to create a Constitution for the Free State. This was undertaken by Collins and a team of solicitors. The outcome of their work became the Irish Constitution of 1922.<ref>The Constitution of the Irish Free State 1922 http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/E900003-004/</ref> He drew up a republican constitution which, without repudiating the Treaty, would include no mention of the British king. His object was that the Constitution would allow participation in the D\u00e1il by dissenting TDs who opposed the Treaty and refused to take any oath mentioning the Crown. Under the Treaty, the Free State was obliged to submit its new Constitution to Westminster for approval. Upon doing so, in June 1922, Collins and Griffith found Lloyd George determined to veto the provisions they had fashioned to prevent civil war.<ref>Coogan, TP. ''Michael Collins''</ref>\n\nThe meetings with Lloyd George and Churchill were bitter and contentious. Collins, although less diplomatic than Griffith or de Valera, had no less penetrating comprehension of political issues. He complained that he was being manipulated into \"doing Churchill's dirty work\", in a potential civil war with his own former troops.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\"/><ref>Michael Collins \u2013 Winston Churchill correspondence June 1922</ref>\n\n==Pact elections==\nNegotiations to prevent civil war resulted in, among others, \"The Army Document\" published in May 1922 which was signed by an equal number of pro- and anti-Treaty IRA officers including Collins, Dan Breen, and [[Gear\u00f3id O'Sullivan]]. This manifesto declared that \"a closing of ranks all round is necessary\" to prevent \"the greatest catastrophe in Irish history.\" It called for new elections, to be followed by the re-unification of the government and army, whatever the result.\n\nIn this spirit and with the organising efforts of moderates on both sides the Collins-de Valera \"Pact\" was created. This pact agreed that new elections to the D\u00e1il would be held with each candidate running as explicitly pro- or anti-Treaty and that, regardless of which side obtained a majority, the two factions would then join to form a coalition government of national unity.\n\nA referendum on the Treaty was also planned but it never took place. The Pact elections on 16 June 1922 therefore comprise the best quantitative record of the Irish public's direct response to the Treaty. The results were pro-Treaty 58 seats, anti-Treaty 35, Labour Party 17, Independents 7, Farmers party 7, plus 4 Unionists from Trinity College, Dublin.<ref>Public Records Office, Dublin</ref>\n\n==Assassination of Sir Henry Wilson==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2018}}\nSix days after the Pact elections, [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Wilson]] was assassinated on 22 June 1922 in broad daylight on the steps of his London home by a pair of London IRA men. A British Army [[field marshal]], Wilson had recently resigned his commission and been elected an MP for a constituency in Northern Ireland. He had a long history as one of the chief British leaders opposing Collins in the Irish conflict. At that time Wilson had served as military advisor to the Northern Ireland government led by [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], in which role he was seen to be responsible for the B-Specials and for other sources of loyalist violence in the north.\n\nThe debate concerning Collins's involvement continued in the 1950s, when a number of statements and rebuttals on the subject were published in periodicals. These were re-printed with additions in Rex Taylor's 1961 book ''Assassination: the death of Sir Henry Wilson and the tragedy of Ireland''. Participants in that discussion were Joe Dolan, Florence O'Donoghue, Denis P. Kelleher, Patrick O'Sullivan and others.<ref>Taylor, Rex.

This was the start of the [[Irish Civil War]].]]\nThe death of Sir Henry Wilson caused a furor in London. Lloyd George, the prime Minister sent a letter to Collins saying that the 'ambiguous position' of the Provisional government with regard to the IRA in the Four Courts could no longer be tolerated. <ref>Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, The Irish Civil War,(2004) p.114</ref>.  The British cabinet met the day after assassination and agreed that Collins reply had not given a 'definite enough commitment' to disperse the Four Courts occupation. They ordered [[Nevil Macready]] commander of the British garrison still in Dublin, to attack the Four Courts, whose republican garrison they blamed from the shooting of Wilson. <ref>Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, The Irish Civil War,(2004) p.115</ref>. The plan was put on hold at the last minute when Macready advised the government, on June 26, to give Collins' Provisional Government one more chance to act against the Four Courts. <ref>Ibid. p.116</ref> \n\nCollins himself was in Cork at the time of the crisis. President Arthur Griffith and military officer Emmet Dalton met with British official to discuss 'the continued occupation of the Four Courts by the Irregulars under Rory O'Connor'. <ref>Sean Boyne, Emmet Dalton, Somme Soldier, Irish General, Film Pioneer p.138 </ref> There is little documentation of the decision to taken by the Provisonal government, headed by Collins, to attack the Four Courts; Historian Michael Hopkinson writes, 'the scarcity of evidence is explained by the acute sensitivity of the subject, both at the time and since'. <ref>Hopkinson, p.116</ref> When Collins arrived back in Dublin, his forces began to act against the anti-Treatyites. On June 27 they arrested anti-Treaty IRA officer Leo Henderson as he was enforcing the Belfast Boycott by seizing cars. <ref>Hopkinson p.117</ref> In retaliation the anti-Treaty IRA men abducted [[J.J. \"Ginger\" O'Connell]], a Free State general and held him in the Four Courts. <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.406</ref>\n\nThese two developments led to the Provisional Government's 27 June 1922 order serving notice on the Four Courts garrison to surrender the building, their arms and release O'Connell, that night or face military action \"at once\". <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.406</ref> According to historian Charles Townsend, 'Collins must have consented to this though the actual decision seems to have been taken by Griffith'. <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.407</ref> [[Peter Hart]] similarly writes, 'it was Griffith rather than Collins who took the lead in this decision'. <ref>Peter Hart, Mick, The Real Michael Collins, p.398</ref> However cabinet member Ernest Blythe recalled that, 'the decision to attack the Four Courts was almost automatic once Collins had agreed to it.<ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p.117</ref>\n\nCollins' position in this conflict was extraordinary indeed. A majority perhaps of the IRA he had helped lead in the War of Independence, were now ranged against the Provisional Government, which he represented. In addition, the force which by the will of the electorate he was obliged to lead had been re-organised since the Truce. Formed from a nucleus of pro-Treaty IRA men, it had evolved into a more formal, structured, uniformed [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] that was armed and funded by Britain. Many of the new members [[Ireland and World War I|were World War I veterans]] and others who had not fought on the nationalist side before. Collins's profoundly mixed feelings about this situation are recorded in his private and official correspondence.<ref>Kissane, Bill.

[[Emmet Dalton]], an Irishman who had served in the British Army and the IRA, who was now a leading Free State commander and close associate of Collins, was placed in charge of it. The Four Courts surrendered after three days of fighting.\n\nHeavy [[Battle of Dublin (1922)|fighting broke out in Dublin]] between the anti-Treaty IRA Dublin Brigade and the Free State troops. Much of O'Connell Street suffered heavy damage; the Gresham Hotel was burned and the Four Courts reduced to a ruin. Still, under Collins' direction, the Free State rapidly took control of the capital. By July 1922 anti-Treaty forces held much of the southern province of Munster and several other areas of the country. At the height of their success, they administered local government and policing in large regions.<ref>Clarke, Kathleen. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'' O'Brien Press 2008</ref> Collins, Richard Mulcahy, and Eoin O'Duffy decided on a series of seaborne landings into republican held areas, which re-took Munster and the west in July\u2013August.\n\nThat July, Collins set aside his title as Chairman of the Provisional Government to become Commander-in-Chief of the National Army. However, according to Charles Townshend, he became 'a kind of generalisimo, combining military and political supremacy. Griffith had no desire or capacity to dispute the day to day conduct of government with him and while Mulcahy had great administrative capacity, he deferred to Collins as a strategist and thinker'.<ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.423</ref> He also [[prorogued]] the meeting of the Dail, or parliament until the end of hostilities, a move that historians such as John Regan have seen as an unconstitutional concentration of power in Collins himself and his military colleagues.<ref>John Regan, Myth and the Irish State (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 2013), pp. 91</ref>\n\n===Civil War peace moves===\n\nRoughly two weeks after Cork city had been taken by Provisional Government forces, Collins travelled there to attempt to seize large sums of money that the anti-Treaty Republicans had lodged in various banks, under the account of the Land Bank. <ref>Dermot Keogh, Michael Collins, the making of the Irish Free State, (2006) p.67-68</ref>\n\nThere is also considerable evidence that Collins's journey to Cork in August 1922 was made in order to meet republican leaders with a view to ending the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\">Feehan, John M.

The anti-Treaty side had called a major convocation of officers to B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th, a remote crossroads, with ending the war on the agenda.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/>\n[[File:Michael Collins Risteard Mulcahy Glasnevin Cemetery at the funeral of Arthur Griffith.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Collins and [[Richard Mulcahy]] at [[Arthur Griffith]]'s funeral, a few days before Collins' own death.]]\nDe Valera was present there, however, Michel Hopkinson writes that 'there is no evidence that there was any prospect of a meeting between de Valera and Collins <ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p.177</ref>. The People's Rights Association, a local initiative in Cork City, had been mediating a discussion of terms between the Provisional Government and the anti-Treaty side for some weeks.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/>\n\nCollins's personal diary outlined his proposals for peace. Republicans must \"accept the People's Verdict\" on the Treaty, but could then \"go home without their arms. We don't ask for any surrender of their principles\".<ref>Hopkinson, Green against Green, p. 177</ref> He argued that the Provisional Government was upholding \"the people's rights\" and would continue to do so. \"We want to avoid any possible unnecessary destruction and loss of life. We do not want to mitigate their weakness by resolute action beyond what is required\". But if Republicans did not accept his terms, \"further blood is on their shoulders\".<ref>Hopkinson, Green against Green, p. 177-178</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Michael Collins body lying in hospital.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Collins' body laid out at [[St. Vincent's University Hospital|St Vincent's Hospital]] in Dublin.]]\nIn August 1922, it seemed as though the Civil War was winding down. The Free State had regained control of most of the country, and Collins was making frequent trips to inspect areas recently recovered from anti-Treaty forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\"/>\n\nHis plan to travel to his native Cork on 20 August was considered particularly dangerous, and he was strenuously advised against it by several trusted associates. County Cork was an IRA stronghold as much of it was still held by anti-Treaty forces. Yet he was determined to make the trip without delay. He had fended off a number of attempts on his life in the preceding weeks and had acknowledged more than once, in private conversation, that the Civil War might end his life at any moment. On several occasions, Collins assured his advisors \"they won't shoot me in my own county,\" or words to that effect.\n\n[[File:Crossley Tender rear 146440.jpg|right|thumb|A replica of the Crossley Tender in Collins' convoy on the day of his death in a replica of the road where it happened on display at the Michael Collins Centre, Clonakilty<ref>[http://www.michaelcollinscentre.com/index.html Michael Collins Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301105029/http://www.michaelcollinscentre.com/index.html |date=1 March 2012 }}, Clonakilty</ref>]]\nOn 22 August 1922 Collins set out from Cork City on a circuitous tour of West Cork. He passed first through Macroom then took the [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] road via [[Crookstown, County Cork|Crookstown]]. This led through [[B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th]], an isolated crossroads. There they stopped at a local pub named 'Long's Pub', now known as [[The Diamond Bar]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thediamondbar.wordpress.com/history/ | title=History| date=2015-04-28}}</ref> to ask a question of a man standing at the crossroad. The man turned out to be an anti-Treaty sentry. He and an associate recognised Collins in the back of the open-top car.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\nAs a result, an ambush was laid by an anti-Treaty column at that point, on the chance that the convoy might come through again on their return journey.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Between 7:30 and 8:00 pm, Collins' convoy approached B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th for the second time. By then most of the ambush party had dispersed and gone for the day, leaving just five or six men on the scene. Two were disarming a mine in the road, while three on a laneway overlooking them, provided cover. A dray cart, placed across the road, remained at the far end of the ambush site.\n\nThe Irregulars in the laneway opened fire with rifles on the convoy. Emmet Dalton ordered the driver of the touring car to 'drive like hell', but Collins said 'no, stop and we'll fight 'em' and jumped from the vehicle along with the others. Collins first took cover behind the low grass bank bordering the road but then jumped up and ran back along the road to begin firing with his Lee Enfield rifle from behind the armoured car. The Vickers machine gun in that car had also been firing at the attackers but then stopped because a badly-loaded ammunition belt caused it to jam. Apparently, to get a better view of the laneway, Collins left the protection of the armoured car and moved even farther back along the road. Now standing in the open, he fired a couple of shots and as he was once more working the bolt of his rifle he was struck in the head by a bullet fired by one of the ambushing party \u2013 Denis \"Sonny\" O'Neill, a former [[British Army]] [[sniper]].<ref>'Gunman believed to have killed Michael Collins was granted a military pension', 'The Irish Times', 3 October 2014.</ref>\n\nCollins was the only fatality sustained in the ambush, although another member of his party suffered a neck wound. After he was shot the fire from the ambushing party quickly fell off and they withdrew from the scene. Collins was found, face down, on the roadway. One of his men whispered an [[Act of Contrition]] into his ear, but Collins was clearly dead. He was lifted into the back of the touring car with his head resting against the shoulder of Emmet Dalton. The convoy cleared the dray cart obstruction and resumed its journey to Cork.\n\nThe lengthy time the convoy took to cover the twenty miles back to Cork City was because many of the roads were blocked and the convoy had to travel across muddy fields and through farms to circumnavigate the obstacles, all in darkness. At times, when the vehicles became bogged down, members of the convoy had to carry Collins' body on their shoulders. The touring car eventually had to be abandoned because of mechanical trouble.\n\nThere was no autopsy. Collins' field diary was taken by General Emmet Dalton who had been with him during his tour of the south. The body was first presented at Shanakiel Hospital in Cork, a small military establishment, and then shipped around the coast to Dublin where it was laid out in St Vincent's Hospital Dublin. From there it was removed to the City Hall beside Dublin Castle where it was laid in state.\n\n===Conspiracy and collusion===\nNumerous questions remain about the events surrounding the death of Collins because the only witnesses to his death were the members of the Free State Army convoy and the anti-Treaty ambushers. As no two stories match and participant statements from both sides are contradictory and inconsistent, unanswered questions linger about what happened that day.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\nThe man believed to have fired the fatal shot, Denis \"Sonny\" O'Neill, was a former officer from the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] who served as a [[sniper]] in the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]], joined the IRA in 1918 and had met Collins on more than one occasion. However, when the Irish Civil War started in June 1922, O'Neill joined the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|Anti-Treaty IRA]]; becoming one of the ambushers of Collins' convoy at [[Beal na Blath]] that August.<ref name=\"Sonny\"/>\n\nO'Neill remains a mysterious figure because of the contradictions in his biography: such as serving in the British Army but then joining the IRA. He provided them with information concerning the [[Igoe Gang]] that worked for the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|British Army Intelligence Centre]]. Twenty years after Collins' death, the Irish State granted O'Neill a Captain's military pension in the 1940s.<ref name=\"Sonny\">{{cite news|title=Gunman believed to have killed Michael Collins was granted a military pension|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date= 3 October 2014|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/gunman-believed-to-have-killed-michael-collins-was-granted-military-pension-1.1949934}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Sean Collins behind the coffin of his brother Michael.jpg|left|thumb|Sean Collins behind the coffin of his brother Michael.]]\n\nCollins lay in state for three days. Tens of thousands of mourners filed past his [[coffin]] to pay their respects, including many British soldiers departing Ireland who had fought against him. His funeral mass took place at Dublin's [[Pro Cathedral]] where a number of foreign and Irish dignitaries were in attendance. Some 500,000 people attended his funeral, almost one fifth of the country's population at that time.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/>\n\nNo official inquiry was ever undertaken into Collins's death and consequently, there is no official version of what happened, nor are there any authoritative, detailed contemporary records.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\n[[File:Collinsfuneral.jpg|right|thumb|Funeral of Michael Collins in the [[St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral|Pro-Cathedral]], Dublin (contemporary newspaper depiction of the [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]])]]\n\nIn this vacuum, independent investigations and conspiracy theorists have put forward a number of suspects as having executed or ordered his death, including an anti-Treaty sharpshooter, members of his own escort, the British secret service, or de Valera himself.\n\nDe Valera is alleged to have declared in 1966, \"It is my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Michael Collins; and it will be recorded at my expense.\"<ref>{{cite book|last= Dolan|first=Anne|title=Commemorating the Irish Civil War: History and Memory, 1923\u20132000 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=iS_3r0vHMxsC&pg=PA87 |series=Studies in the Social and Cultural History of Modern Warfare|volume=13|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02698-7|page=87}}</ref>\n\nA number of books have been devoted entirely to the study of Collins' death (in chronological order): ''The Day Michael Was Shot'' by Meda Ryan, ''The Shooting of Michael Collins: Murder or Accident?'' by John M.

Sigerson.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Michael Collins On Bicycle.jpg|right|thumb|Collins on his bicycle.]]\nCollins's elderly father inspired his fondness and respect for older people. His mother, who had spent her youth caring for her own invalid mother and raising her own brothers and sisters, was a powerful influence. The entire management of the Collins farm fell to her, as her husband succumbed to old age and died. In a society which honoured hospitality as a prime virtue, Mrs Collins was eulogised as \"a hostess in ten thousand.\" Her five daughters avowedly doted on their youngest brother.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/> He enjoyed rough-housing and outdoor sports. Having won a local wrestling championship while still a boy, he is said to have made a pastime of challenging larger, older opponents, with frequent success. A very fit, active man throughout life, in the most stressful times he continued to enjoy wrestling as a form of relaxation and valued friendships which afforded opportunities to share athletic pursuits.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/> He could be abrasive, demanding, and inconsiderate of those around him, but frequently made up for it with gestures such as confectionery and other small gifts.<ref>O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins'', Dublin, Gill & MacMillan 1980.{{Page needed|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnlike some of his political opponents, he was characterized by many close personal friendships within the movement. It has been justly said that while some were devoted to \"the idea of Ireland\", Collins was a people person whose patriotism was rooted in affection and respect for the people of Ireland around him. Among his famous last words is the final entry in his pocket diary, written on the journey which ended his life, \"The people are splendid.\"<ref>Michael Collins field diary, 22 August 1922</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceH\"/>\n\n[[File:Kitty Kiernan.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Kitty Kiernan]]\n\nIn 1921\u201322, he became engaged to [[Kitty Kiernan]].\n\nCollins was a complex man whose character abounded in contradictions. Although Minister of Finance and an accountant by pre-war profession, he seems never to have pursued personal profit; indeed he was sometimes all but homeless during the war for independence. This characteristic was exemplified by a letter he wrote on 4 August 1922 to his canvassing agent; offering to pay half the bill for a hired election car because some of the journeys had been for personal trips.<ref>Kennerk, Barry and Alison Healy, Evidence of an Irish Politician's Scruples on Expenses...in 1922 in  ''Irish Times'', 8 Nov. 2010</ref> While clearly fond of command and keen to take charge, he had an equal appetite for input and advice from people at every level of the organisation, prompting the comment that \"he took advice from his chauffeur.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceG\"/> Although acknowledged by friends and foes as \"head centre\" of the movement, he continually chose a title just short of actual head of state; becoming Chairman of the Provisional Government only after the abdication of half the D\u00e1il forced him to do so. While his official and personal correspondence records his solicitous care for the wants of insurgents in need, during the war he showed no hesitation in ordering the death of opponents who threatened nationalist lives.<ref>Collins, Michael (Costello, Francis J., Ed.) ''Michael Collins In His Own Words'', Dublin, Gill & Macmillan, 1997</ref>\n\nCertainly a man of fierce pride, his pride was tempered by a sense of humour that included a keen sense of the absurd in his own situation.<ref>Michael Collins personal correspondence</ref> While mastermind of a clandestine military, he remained a public figure. When official head of the Free State government, he continued to cooperate in the IRA's secret operations. He was capable of bold, decisive actions on his own authority, which caused friction with his colleagues, such as his falling out with [[Cathal Brugha]]; but at critical junctures he could also bow to majority decisions which were profoundly disadvantageous and dangerous to his own interests (such as his appointment to the Treaty negotiating team).\n\n==Commemoration==\n[[File:Grave of Miche\u00e1l \u00d3 Coile\u00e1in.jpg|left|thumb|Memorial cross at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th.]]\nAn annual commemoration ceremony takes place each year in August at the ambush site at [[B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th]], County Cork, organised by The B\u00e9al na mBl\u00e1th Commemoration Committee.

Selections have been published in ''The Path to Freedom'' (Mercier, 1968) and in ''Michael Collins in His Own Words'' (Gill & Macmillan, 1997). In the 1960s, Taoiseach Se\u00e1n Lemass, himself a veteran of the 1916 Rising and War of Independence, credited Collins's ideas as the basis for his successes in revitalizing Ireland's economy.\n\nNine years after his death, the UK Parliament passed the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which removed virtually all of London's remaining authority over the Free State and the other dominions. This had the effect of making the Free State the first internationally recognised independent Irish state, thus fulfilling Collins' vision of having \"the freedom to achieve freedom.\"\n\n==Societies==\nThe '''Collins 22 Society''' established in 2002 is an international organisation dedicated to keeping the name and legacy of Michael Collins in living memory. The patron of the society is Ireland's former Minister for Justice and TD [[Nora Owen]], grand-niece of Michael Collins.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:Bust of Michael Collins at Merrion Square Park, Dublin, Ireland..JPG|left|thumb|Bust of Michael Collins at Merrion Square Park, Dublin, Ireland.]]\nThe 1936 film ''[[Beloved Enemy]]'' is a fictionalised account of Collins's life. Unlike the real Michael Collins, the fictionalised \"Dennis Riordan\" (played by [[Brian Aherne]]) is shot, but recovers. ''[[Hang Up Your Brightest Colours]]'', a British [[documentary film|documentary]] by [[Kenneth Griffith]], was made for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1973, but refused transmission. It was eventually screened by the [[BBC]] in [[Wales]] in 1993 and across the United Kingdom the following year.\n\nIn 1969, [[Dominic Behan]] wrote an episode of the UK television series [[Play for today]] entitled 'Michael Collins'. The play dealt with Collins' attempt to take the gun out of Irish politics and took the perspective of the Republican argument. At the time of writing the script, [[the troubles]] had just begun in Northern Ireland and the [[BBC]] were reluctant to broadcast the production. An appeal by the author to [[David Attenborough]] (Director of Programming for the BBC at that time) resulted in the play eventually being broadcast; Attenborough took the view that the imperatives of free speech could not be compromised in the cause of political expediency.\n\nAn [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] documentary made by Colm Connolly for [[RT\u00c9 Television]] in 1989 called ''The Shadow of B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th'' covered Collins's death. A made-for-TV film, ''[[The Treaty (film)|The Treaty]]'', was produced in 1991 and starred [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Collins and [[Ian Bannen]] as [[David Lloyd George]]. In 2007, RT\u00c9 produced a documentary entitled ''Get Collins'', about the intelligence war which took place in [[Dublin]].<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/tv/hiddenhistory/getcollins.html RTE.ie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030033543/http://www.rte.ie/tv/hiddenhistory/getcollins.html |date=30 October 2008 }}, \"Get Collins\"</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1227857/ IMDb.com], \"Get Collins\"</ref>\n\nCollins was the subject of [[film director|director]] [[Neil Jordan]]'s 1996 film ''[[Michael Collins (film)|Michael Collins]]'', with [[Liam Neeson]] in the title role.

Collins appeared as a background character, taking part in the uprising, played by Sebastian Thommen.\n\nCollins was portrayed by Gavin Drea in the 2019 sequel to Rebellion, [[Resistance (miniseries)|Resistance]].\n\n===Songs===\n[[File:Wax figure of Michael Collins at the National Wax Plus Museum, Dublin, Ireland..JPG|right|thumb|Wax figure of Michael Collins at the [[National Wax Plus Museum]], Dublin, Ireland.]]\nIrish-American [[folk rock]] band [[Black 47]] recorded a song entitled \"[[The Big Fellah]]\" which was the first track on their 1994 album ''Home of the Brave''. It details Collins's career, from the [[Easter Rising]] to his death at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th. Irish [[Folk music|folk]] band the [[Wolfe Tones]] recorded a song titled \"Michael Collins\" on ''[[A Sense of Freedom (album)|A Sense of Freedom]]'' (1983) about Collins's life and death, although it begins when he was about 16 and took a job in London. Celtic metal band [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]] recorded a song also titled \"Michael Collins\" on their 2004 album ''[[Pagan (album)|Pagan]]'' which dealt with his role in the Civil War, the treaty and his eventual death. Also a song by [[Johnny McEvoy]], simply named \"Michael\", depicts Collins's death and the sadness surrounding his funeral.\n\nThe poem \"The laughing boy\" by [[Brendan Behan]] lamenting the death of Collins was translated into Greek in 1961 by Vasilis Rotas. In October of the same year, [[Mikis Theodorakis]] composed the song \"T\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03af\" (\"The laughing boy\") using Rotas' translation.

It was the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'' (1969). \"The laughing boy\" became the song of protest against the [[dictatorship in Greece]] (1967\u20131974) and remains to date one of the most popular songs in Greek popular culture.\n\n===Plays===\nJournalist Eamonn O'Neill wrote the play ''God Save Ireland Cried the Hero'' about Collins' last night alive.

{"title_page": "Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters", "text_new": "''Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters'' is a children's picture book published in 1987 by [[John Steptoe]]. With deep rural African roots, Steptoe teaches his audience about the power of kindness, thoughtfulness, and why it is important to always do the right thing- even if you think no one is watching. This book illustrates the \"[[Cinderella]]\" theme in a new light, and also highlights the theme of jealousy. ''Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters'' won many awards for Steptoe's illustrations, and went on to be adapted into many different children's literature curriculums.\n\n== Brief Plot Summary ==\nIn this book, The Great King calls upon his citizens to present him with the most beautiful and worthy young women in the village so he can choose a wife. Mufaro has two daughters, Nyasha and Manyara, who he believes are both worthy to be queen. However, Manyara is very mean to her sister and the other villagers. Both sisters travel to meet the king and the king picks Nyasha because she was kind to everyone (he knew this because he shape-shifted into many different animals to watch the daughter's actions). Manyara goes on to be a servant in Nyasha and the king's household, and the story ends there.\n\n== Pivotal Points ==\n\n# '''Manyara is introduced as the villain''' (Steptoe, page 2):  Steptoe clearly states to the audience that Manyara is rude to her sister and teases her endlessly. This sets Manyara up to be the antagonist in the picture book.\n# '''Nyasha is introduced as selfless''' (Steptoe, page 2): In the wake of tormenting by her sister, Nyasha states that she will always love her sister because she is \"cleaver and strong and beautiful\". This act of unnecessary niceness portrays Nyasha as kind, gentle, and loving, and sets her up to be the protagonist in our story. \n# '''Nyasha meets Nyoka''' (Steptoe, page 7): Nyasha is tending to her garden when she meets a small green snake who she names \"Nyoka\". Nyoka is always at her side when she is tending to her garden and acts as a friend to her. \n# '''The Great King calls for a wife''' (Steptoe, page 8): Word is sent to the village that the Great King is looking for a wife and that the village must send all beautiful and worthy young women to meet the king. Mufaro is adamant that both daughters should go to meet the king because he believes they are both worthy enough to be a queen. \n# '''Manyara leaves early for the kingdom and runs into trouble''' (Steptoe, page 10): Manyara is met with a young hungry boy, an old women who gave advice, and a slew of laughing trees. Manyara did not feed the hungry boy, did not listen to the advice of the old lady, and did not follow the instructions when she approached the laughing trees. \n# '''Nyasha leaves for the kingdom''' (Steptoe, page 12): Nyasha leaves with her family to travel to the kingdom. During her travels she runs into the same three things her sister saw : a hungry boy, an old woman, and some laughing trees. However, Nyasha fed the hungry boy, listened to the old women, and followed the instructions of the laughing trees. \n# '''The Great King choses Nyasha to be his wife''' (Steptoe, page 18): It is not revealed to the audience (and the characters) that Nyoka, the garden snake, was actually the prince all along. Nyoka transforms from snake to his true form as a human male, and chooses to marry Manyara.\n\n== Inspiration ==\nSteptoe derived his inspiration from the folktale, [[Kaffir Folk-lore|''Kaffir Folk-lore'',]] published by author G.M. Theal in 1895. Steptoe's illustrations reflect his time in studying an ancient city in [[Zimbabwe]]; the images of flowers and trees are exact replicas of the ones that lived during the reign of this unknown ancient city.\n\n== Characters ==\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mufaro (moo-FAR-oh): means \u201chappy man\u201d in [[Shona language|Shona]] (native language of Steptoe); the father of Nyasha and Manyara; has some power in the village, but it is unclear the extent of it\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyasha (n\u00e9e-AH-sha): means \u201cmercy\u201d in Shona; one of Mufaro's daughters; becomes queen at the end of the story\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manyara (mahn-YAR-ah): means \u201cashamed\u201d in Shona; one of Mufaro's daughters; becomes servant at the end of the story; is consistently mean to her sister, animals, and the other villagers\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyoka (n\u00e9e-YO-kah): means \u201csnake\u201d in Shona; is the king but we do not know that until the end of the story; the king shape-shifted into a snake (hence the name) to spy on the village women to decide which one is suitable to be his wife.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n* \"[[Cinderella]]\": very similar to the classic tale, popularized by Disney's version of the story, Steptoe mimics the storyline of a king looking for a suitable wife.<ref>Weikle-Mills, C.

In the end of the novel, the act of jealousy is punished and seen as unfavorable to readers because the king choose the non-jealous sister to be queen.\n\n== Awards for ''Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters''==\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The [[Caldecott Medal]] (1988): The Caldecott Medal is awarded annually to celebrate the achievement of picture book.<ref>\"The Randolph Caldecott Medal\", American Library Association, November 30, 1999.\n\n<nowiki>http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/aboutcaldecott/aboutcaldecott</nowiki> (Accessed March 22, 2020)</ref>\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0[[Coretta Scott King Award]] for Illustrators (1988): The Coretta Scott King Award for Illustrators is awarded annually to one African American illustrator who demonstrates \"appreciation of African American culture and universal human values\".<ref>\"The Coretta Scott King Book Awards\", American Library Association, January 18, 2009.\n\n<nowiki>http://www.ala.org/rt/emiert/cskbookawards</nowiki> (Accessed March 22, 2020)</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nDue to the book's progressive nature of putting value on kindness and the positives of living in a natural world, the book was welcomed among scholars and celebrated for its pointant tale along with beautiful illustrations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/clarita-kohen/mufaros-beautiful-daughters/|title=Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It went on to become a part of children's education about the need for generosity,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/mufaros-beautiful-daughters-literature-guide|title=Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters Literature Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> the importance of black representation in children's books,<ref>Muse, Daphne. \u201cBlack American Classics in Fiction and Poetry for Young Readers.\u201d ''American Visions'', vol. 8, no. 6, Dec. 1993, p. 33.

In the end of the novel, the act of jealousy is punished and seen as unfavorable to readers because the king choose the non-jealous sister to be queen.\n\n== Awards for ''Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters''==\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The [[Caldecott Medal]] (1988): The Caldecott Medal is awarded annually to celebrate the achievement of picture book.<ref>\"The Randolph Caldecott Medal\", American Library Association, November 30, 1999.\n\n<nowiki>http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/aboutcaldecott/aboutcaldecott</nowiki> (Accessed March 22, 2020)</ref>\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0[[Coretta Scott King Award]] for Illustrators (1988): The Coretta Scott King Award for Illustrators is awarded annually to one African American illustrator who demonstrates \"appreciation of African American culture and universal human values\".<ref>\"The Coretta Scott King Book Awards\", American Library Association, January 18, 2009.\n\n<nowiki>http://www.ala.org/rt/emiert/cskbookawards</nowiki> (Accessed March 22, 2020)</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nDue to the book's progressive nature of putting value on kindness and the positives of living in a natural world, the book was welcomed among scholars and celebrated for its pointant tale along with beautiful illustrations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/clarita-kohen/mufaros-beautiful-daughters/|title=Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It went on to become a part of children's education about the need for generosity,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/mufaros-beautiful-daughters-literature-guide|title=Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters Literature Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> the importance of black representation in children's books,<ref>Muse, Daphne. \u201cBlack American Classics in Fiction and Poetry for Young Readers.\u201d ''American Visions'', vol. 8, no. 6, Dec. 1993, p. 33.

confrontation of the [[First Indochina War]] that took place between 13 March and 7 May 1954. It was fought between the [[French Union]]'s [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] and [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh|Viet Minh]] [[Communism|communist]] [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]].\n\nIt was, from the French view before the event, a [[Pitched battle|set piece battle]] to draw out the Vietnamese and destroy them with superior firepower. As a result of blunders in French decision-making, however, the French began an operation to insert, then support, their soldiers at [[\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7]], deep in the hills of northwestern [[Vietnam]]. The operation's purpose was to cut off Viet Minh supply lines into the neighboring [[Kingdom of Laos]] (a French ally), and draw the Viet Minh into a major confrontation in order to cripple them. The plan was to resupply the French position by air, and was based on the belief that the Viet Minh had no [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft capability]]. The Viet Minh, however, under General [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]], surrounded and [[Siege|besieged]] the French. They brought in vast amounts of heavy artillery (including [[Antiaircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]]) and managed to move these bulky weapons through difficult terrain up the rear slopes of the mountains. The Viet Minh were then able to dig tunnels through the mountain, and emplaced the artillery pieces overlooking the French encampment.\n\nIn March, a massive artillery bombardment by the Viet Minh ensued. The strategic positioning of their artillery made it nearly impervious to French [[counter-battery fire]]. Tenacious fighting on the ground ensued, reminiscent of the [[trench warfare]] of World War I. At times, the French repulsed Viet Minh assaults on their positions while supplies and reinforcements were delivered by air. As key positions were overrun, the perimeter contracted, and the air resupply on which the French had placed their hopes became impossible. As the Viet Minh anti-aircraft fire took its toll, fewer and fewer of those supplies reached the French. The garrison was overrun in May after a two-month siege, and most of the French forces surrendered. A few of them escaped to [[Laos]]. The French government in Paris then resigned, and the new Prime Minister, the left-of-centre [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France]], supported French withdrawal from Indochina.\n\nThe Battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 was decisive; the war ended shortly afterward and the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Accords]] were signed. France agreed to withdraw its forces from all its colonies in [[French Indochina]], while stipulating that Vietnam would be temporarily divided at the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|17th parallel]], with control of the north given to the Viet Minh as the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]], and the south becoming the [[South Vietnam|State of Vietnam]], nominally under Emperor [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], preventing Ho Chi Minh from gaining control of the entire country.<ref>Nash, Gary B., Julie Roy Jeffrey, John R.

New York: Longman, 2007.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n=== Military situation ===\nBy 1953, the [[First Indochina War]] was not going well for France. A succession of commanders&nbsp;\u2013 [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]], [[Jean \u00c9tienne Valluy]], [[Roger Blaizot]], [[Marcel Carpentier]], [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]], and [[Raoul Salan]]&nbsp;\u2013 had proven incapable of suppressing the insurrection of the [[Viet Minh]] fighting for independence. During their 1952\u20131953 campaign, the Viet Minh had overrun vast swathes of [[Laos]], Vietnam's western neighbor, advancing as far as [[Luang Prabang]] and the [[Plain of Jars]]. The French were unable to slow the Viet Minh advance, who fell back only after outrunning their always-tenuous supply lines. In 1953, the French had begun to strengthen their defenses in the [[Hanoi]] delta region to prepare for a series of offensives against Viet Minh [[staging area]]s in northwest Vietnam. They set up fortified towns and outposts in the area, including [[Lai Ch\u00e2u]] near the Chinese border to the north,{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=23}} [[N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n]] to the west of Hanoi,{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=9}} and the Plain of Jars in northern Laos.{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=48}}\n\nIn May 1953, French Premier [[Ren\u00e9 Mayer]] appointed [[Henri Navarre]], a trusted colleague, to take command of [[French Union]] forces in Indochina. Mayer had given Navarre a single order\u2014to create military conditions that would lead to an \"honorable political solution\".<ref name=\"d165\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=165}}</ref> According to military scholar [[Phillip Davidson]],\n<blockquote> On arrival, Navarre was shocked by what he found. There had been no long-range plan since de Lattre's departure. Everything was conducted on a day-to-day, reactive basis. Combat operations were undertaken only in response to enemy moves or threats. There was no comprehensive plan to develop the organization and build up the equipment of the Expeditionary force. Finally, Navarre, the intellectual, the cold and professional soldier, was shocked by the \"school's out\" attitude of [[Raoul Salan|Salan]] and his senior commanders and staff officers. They were going home, not as victors or heroes, but then, not as clear losers either. To them the important thing was that they were getting out of Indochina with their reputations frayed, but intact. They gave little thought to, or concern for, the problems of their successors.<ref name=\"d165\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n and the hedgehog concept ===\n{{details|Battle of N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n}}\nNavarre began searching for a way to stop the Viet Minh threat to Laos. Colonel Louis Berteil, commander of Mobile Group 7 and Navarre's main planner,{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=44}} formulated the ''h\u00e9risson'' ('[[hedgehog defence|hedgehog]]') concept. The French army would establish a fortified [[airhead (warfare)|airhead]] by airlifting soldiers to positions adjacent to key Viet Minh supply lines to Laos.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=173}} They would cut off Viet Minh soldiers fighting in Laos and force them to withdraw. \"It was an attempt to interdict the enemy's rear area, to stop the flow of supplies and reinforcements, to establish a redoubt in the enemy's rear and disrupt his lines\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Kennedy |first= Bruce |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/11/spotlight |title=1954 battle changed Vietnam's history |website=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219033545/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/11/spotlight |archivedate=19 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe hedgehog concept was based on French experiences at the [[Battle of N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n]]. In late November and early December 1952, Gi\u00e1p had attacked the French outpost at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n, which was essentially an \"air-land base\", a fortified camp supplied only by air.{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=24}} The French had beaten back Gi\u00e1p's forces repeatedly, inflicting very heavy losses on them.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|p=125}} The French hoped that by repeating the strategy on a much larger scale, they would be able to lure Gi\u00e1p into committing the bulk of his forces to a massed assault. This would enable superior French artillery, armor, and air support to decimate the exposed Viet Minh forces.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|pp=216\u2013217}} The success at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n convinced Navarre of the viability of the fortified airhead concept.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|p=222}}\n\nFrench staff officers failed to treat seriously several crucial differences between \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 and N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n:\nFirst, at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n, the French commanded most of the high ground with overwhelming artillery support.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=147}} At \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, however, the Viet Minh controlled much of the high ground around the valley, their artillery far exceeded French expectations, and they outnumbered the French troops four to one.<ref name=\"d224\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=224}}</ref> Gi\u00e1p compared \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 to a \"rice bowl\", where his troops occupied the edge and the French the bottom.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|p=258}} Second, Gi\u00e1p made a mistake at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n by committing his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|p=258}} He learned his lesson: at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, Gi\u00e1p spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Artillery pieces were sited within well-constructed and camouflaged [[casemate]]s. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns Gi\u00e1p possessed.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|pp=291\u2013292}} Third, the aerial resupply lines at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n were never severed, despite Viet Minh anti-aircraft fire. At \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, Gi\u00e1p amassed anti-aircraft batteries that quickly shut down the runway, and made it extremely difficult and costly for the French to bring in reinforcements.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|pp=294\u2013295}}\n\n== Prelude ==\n\n=== Lead up to Castor ===\n[[File:To\u00e0n c\u1ea3nh c\u00e1nh \u0111\u1ed3ng \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of the Dien Bien Phu valley in 1953]]\n\nIn June 1953 [[Major General]] [[Ren\u00e9 Cogny]], the French commander in the [[Tonkin]] Delta, proposed [[\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7]], which had an old airstrip built by the Japanese during World War II, as a \"mooring point\".{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=182}} In another misunderstanding, Cogny envisioned a lightly defended point from which to launch raids; Navarre, however, believed that he intended to build a heavily fortified base capable of withstanding a siege. Navarre selected \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 for Berteil's \"hedgehog\" operation. When presented with the plan, every major subordinate officer \u2013 Colonel [[Jean-Louis Nicot]] (commander of the French Air transport fleet), Cogny, and Generals Jean Gilles and Jean Dechaux (the ground and air commanders for ''Operation Castor'', the initial airborne assault on \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7) \u2013 protested.<ref name=D184/> Cogny pointed out, presciently, that \"we are running the risk of a new [[Battle of N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n|N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n]] under worse conditions\".{{sfn|Roy|2002|p=21}} Navarre rejected the criticisms of his proposal and concluded a 17 November conference by declaring that the operation would begin three days later, on 20 November 1953.{{sfn|Roy|2002|p=33}}<ref name=D184>{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=184}}</ref>\n\nNavarre decided to go ahead with the plan despite serious operational difficulties. These later became painfully obvious, but at the time may have been less apparent.<ref>Windrow, pp. 211, 212, 228, 275</ref> He had been repeatedly assured by his intelligence officers that the operation carried very little risk of involvement by a strong enemy force.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=189}} Navarre had previously considered three other approaches to defending Laos: [[maneuver warfare|mobile warfare]], which was impossible given the terrain in Vietnam; a [[static defense]] line stretching to Laos, which was not feasible given the number of troops at Navarre's disposal; or placing troops in the Laotian provincial capitals and supplying them by air, which was unworkable due to the distance from [[Hanoi]] to [[Luang Prabang]] and [[Vientiane]].{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=186}} Navarre believed that this left only the hedgehog option, which he characterized as \"a mediocre solution\".{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=187}} The French National Defense Committee ultimately agreed that Navarre's responsibility did not include defending Laos. However, its decision, which was drawn up on 13 November, was not delivered to him until 4 December, two weeks after the \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 operation began.<ref name=\"d176\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=176}}</ref>\n\n=== Establishment of air operations ===\n{{details|topic=Dien Bien Phu order of battle|Operation Castor}}\n[[File:Dien Bien Phu001.jpg|thumb|250px|Colonel [[Christian de Castries]], French commander at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7]]\n\nOperations at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 began at 10:35 on 20 November 1953. In ''Operation Castor'', the French dropped or flew 9,000 troops into the area over three days, as well as a bulldozer to prepare the airstrip. They were landed at three drop zones: \"Natasha\" (northwest of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7), \"Octavie\" (to the southwest), and \"Simone\" (to the southeast).{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=194}} The Viet Minh elite 148th Independent Infantry Regiment, headquartered at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, reacted \"instantly and effectively\". Three of its four battalions, however, were absent.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=193}}\nInitial operations proceeded well for the French. By the end of November, six parachute battalions had been landed, and the French Army consolidated its positions.

He had expected an attack, but had not foreseen when or where it would occur. Gi\u00e1p realized that, if pressed, the French would abandon [[Lai Ch\u00e2u Province]] and fight a [[pitched battle]] at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7.<ref name=\"Davidson_p196\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=196}}</ref> On 24 November, Gi\u00e1p ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the [[316th Division (Vietnam)|316th Division]] to attack Lai Chau, while the [[308 Division (Vietnam)|308th]], [[312th]], and [[351st Division|351st]] divisions assaulted \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 from ''[[Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc]]''.<ref name=\"Davidson_p196\" />\n\nStarting in December, the French, under the command of Colonel [[Christian de Castries]], began transforming their anchoring point into a fortress by setting up seven satellite positions. (Each was said to be named after a former mistress of de Castries, although the allegation is probably unfounded, as the eight names begin with letters from the first nine of the alphabet, excluding F.) The fortified headquarters was centrally located, with positions ''Huguette'' to the west, ''Claudine'' to the south, and ''Dominique'' to the northeast.<ref name=\"Davidson, p. 199\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=199}}</ref> The other positions were ''Anne-Marie'' to the northwest, ''Beatrice'' to the northeast, ''Gabrielle'' to the north, and ''Isabelle'' {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} to the south, covering the reserve airstrip.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|p=312}}\n\nThe choice of de Castries as the local commander at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 was, in retrospect, a bad one.

But \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 would require a commander adept at World War I-style [[trench warfare]], something for which de Castries was not suited.<ref name=\"Davidson, p. 199\" />\n[[File:General Staff in Battle of Dien Bien Phu.jpeg|thumb|280px|left|General Vo Nguyen Giap presents his plan to Party and State leaders including Ho Chi Minh (second left)]]\n\nThe arrival of the 316th Viet Minh Division prompted Cogny to order the evacuation of the Lai Chau garrison to \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, exactly as Gi\u00e1p had anticipated. En route, they were virtually annihilated by the Viet Minh. \"Of the 2,100 men who left Lai Chau on 9 December, only 185 made it to \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 on 22 December.

Artillery as well as ten US [[M24 Chaffee]] light tanks (each broken down into 180 individual parts, flown into the base, and then re-assembled) and numerous aircraft (attack and supply types) were committed to the garrison. A number of quadruple 0.50 calibre machine guns were present and used in the ground role.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Dien Bien Phu: The Epic Battle America Forgot'' by Howard E. Simpson (a US diplomat)</ref>This included France's regular troops (notably elite paratrooper units, plus those of the artillery), French [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legionnaires]], Algerian and Moroccan [[tirailleur]]s (colonial troops from North Africa) and locally-recruited Indochinese (Laotian, Vietnamese and Cambodian) infantry.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|pp=303\u2013308}}\n\nIn comparison, altogether the Viet Minh had moved up to 50,000 regular troops into the hills surrounding the French-held valley, totalling five divisions, including the 351st Heavy Division, which was an artillery formation equipped with medium artillery, such as the US [[M101 howitzer|M101]] 105mm howitzer, supplied by the neighbouring People's Republic of China (PRC) from captured stocks obtained from defeated [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Nationalist China]] as well as US forces [[Korean War|in Korea]], together with some heavier field-guns as well as anti-aircraft artillery.<ref name=\"d223\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=223}}</ref> Various types of artillery and anti-aircraft guns (mainly of Soviet origin), which outnumbered their French counterparts by about four to one,<ref name=\"d223\" /> were moved into strategic positions overlooking the valley and the French forces based there. The French garrison came under sporadic direct artillery fire from the Viet Minh for the first time on 31 January 1954 and patrols encountered the Viet Minh troops in all directions around them. The French were completely surrounded.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=220}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n=== ''B\u00e9atrice'' ===\n[[File:Dien Bein Phu map.png|thumb|250px|French dispositions at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, as of March 1954. The French took up positions on a series of fortified hills. The southernmost, Isabelle, was isolated. The Viet Minh positioned their five divisions (the 304th, 308th, 312th, 316th, and 351st) in the surrounding areas to the north and east. From these areas, the Viet Minh artillery had a clear line of sight to the French fortifications and were able to accurately target the French positions.]]\n\nThe Viet Minh assault began in earnest on 13 March 1954 with an attack on the northeastern outpost, ''B\u00e9atrice'', which was held by the 3rd Battalion, 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade. Viet Minh artillery opened a fierce bombardment with two batteries each of 105{{nbsp}}mm howitzers, 120{{nbsp}}mm mortars, and 75{{nbsp}}mm mountain guns (plus seventeen 57{{nbsp}}mm recoilless rifles and numerous 60{{nbsp}}mm and 81/82{{nbsp}}mm mortars). French command was disrupted at 18:30 when a shell hit the French command post, killing the battalion commander, Major Paul P\u00e9got, and most of his staff. A few minutes later, Lieutenant colonel [[Jules Gaucher]], commander of the entire central subsector, was also killed by artillery fire. The Viet Minh 312th Division then launched an assault with its 141st and 209th Infantry Regiments, using [[sapper]]s to breach the French obstacles.\n\n''B\u00e9atrice'' comprised three separate strong points forming a triangle with the point facing north. In the southeast, strong point ''Beatrice''-3, its defenses smashed by 75{{nbsp}}mm mountain guns firing at point-blank range, was quickly overrun by the 209th Regiment's 130th Battalion. In the north, most of ''Beatrice''-1 was swiftly conquered by the 141st Regiment's 428th Battalion, but the defenders held out in corner of the position for a time because the attackers thought they had captured the entire strong point when they encountered an internal barbed wire barrier in the dark. In the southwest, the assault on ''Beatrice''-2 by the 141st Regiment's 11th Battalion did not fare well because its assault trenches were too shallow and portions of them had been flattened by French artillery. Its efforts to breach ''Beatrice''-2's barbed wire were stalled for hours by flanking fire from ''Beatrice''-1 and several previously-undetected bunkers on ''Beatrice''-2 that had been spared by the bombardment. The holdouts on ''Beatrice''-1 were eliminated by 22:30, and the 141st Regiment's 11th and 16th Battalions finally broke into ''Beatrice''-2 an hour later, though the strong point was not entirely taken until after 01:00 on 14 March.{{sfn|Boylan|Olivier|2018|pp=78\u201383}} Roughly 350 French legionnaires were killed, wounded, or captured. About 100 managed to escape and rejoin the French lines. The French estimated that Viet Minh losses totalled 600 dead and 1,200 wounded.<ref name=\"d236\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=236}}</ref> The victory at ''Beatrice'' \"galvanized the morale\" of the Viet Minh troops.<ref name=\"d236\" /> On the following morning, a truce of a few hours was agreed and the French were authorized to come to the captured position and evacuate their wounded and dead.\n\nMuch to French disbelief, the Viet Minh had employed direct artillery fire, in which each gun crew does its own [[artillery spotting]] (as opposed to indirect fire, in which guns are massed further away from the target, out of direct line of sight, and rely on a forward artillery spotter). Indirect artillery, generally held as being far superior to direct fire, requires experienced, well-trained crews and good communications, which the Viet Minh lacked.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=227}} Navarre wrote that, \"Under the influence of Chinese advisers, the Viet Minh commanders had used processes quite different from the classic methods. The artillery had been dug in by single pieces...They were installed in shellproof dugouts, and fire point-blank from portholes... This way of using artillery and AA guns was possible only with the expansive ant holes at the disposal of the Vietminh and was to make shambles of all the estimates of our own artillerymen.\"<ref>Navarre, p. 225</ref> Two days later, the French artillery commander, Colonel [[Charles Piroth]], distraught at his inability to silence the well-camouflaged Viet Minh batteries, went into his dugout and committed suicide with a [[hand grenade]].<ref name=\"Windrow, p. 412\">{{harvnb|Windrow|2004|p=412}}</ref> He was buried there in secret to prevent loss of morale among the French troops.<ref name=\"Windrow, p. 412\"/>\n\n=== ''Gabrielle'' ===\n[[File:D\u00e2n c\u00f4ng d\u00e2n t\u1ed9c v\u1eadn chuy\u1ec3n h\u00e0ng ra m\u1eb7t tr\u1eadn.jpg|thumb|300px|Viet Minh porters on their way to the battle; thousands were used to handle supplies, food, weapons and ammunition to the besiegers]]\n\nFollowing a five-hour ceasefire on the morning of 14 March, Viet Minh artillery resumed pounding French positions. The airstrip, already closed since 16:00 the day before due to a light bombardment, was now put permanently out of commission.<ref>{{cite book |last=Simpson |first=Howard R. |title=Dien Bien Phu: the epic battle America forgot |date=May 1994 |isbn=0-02-881047-3 |publisher=Brassey's (US) |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780028810478}}</ref> Any further French supplies would have to be delivered by parachute.<ref name=\"d237\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=237}}</ref> That night, the Viet Minh launched an attack on the northern outpost  ''Gabrielle'', held by an elite Algerian battalion. The attack began with a concentrated artillery barrage at 17:00. This was very effective and stunned the defenders. Two regiments from the crack 308th Division attacked starting at 20:00. At 04:00 the following morning, an artillery shell hit the battalion headquarters, severely wounding the battalion commander and most of his staff.<ref name=\"d237\" />\n\nDe Castries ordered a counterattack to relieve ''Gabrielle''. However, Colonel [[Pierre Langlais]], in forming the counterattack, chose to rely on the 5th Vietnamese Parachute Battalion, which had jumped in the day before and was exhausted.<ref name=\"d238\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=238}}</ref> Although some elements of the counterattack reached ''Gabrielle'', most were paralyzed by Viet Minh artillery and took heavy losses. At 08:00 the next day, the Algerian battalion fell back, abandoning ''Gabrielle'' to the Viet Minh. The French lost around 1,000 men defending ''Gabrielle'', and the Viet Minh between 1,000 and 2,000 attacking the strongpoint.<ref name=\"d238\" />\n\n=== ''Anne-Marie'' ===\nThe northwestern outpost ''Anne-Marie'' was defended by [[Tai peoples|Tai troops]], members of an ethnic minority loyal to the French. For weeks, Gi\u00e1p had distributed subversive propaganda leaflets, telling the Tais that this was not their fight. The fall of ''Beatrice'' and ''Gabrielle'' had demoralized them. On the morning of 17 March, under the cover of fog, the bulk of the Tais left or defected. The French and the few remaining Tais on ''Anne-Marie'' were then forced to withdraw.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=239}}\n\n=== Lull ===\nA lull in fighting occurred from 17 to 30 March. The Viet Minh further tightened the noose around the French central area (formed by the strong points ''Huguette'', ''Dominique'', ''Claudine'', and ''Eliane''), effectively cutting off ''Isabelle'' and its 1,809 personnel to the south.{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=279}} During this lull, the French suffered from a serious crisis of command. \"It had become painfully evident to the senior officers within the encircled garrison \u2013 and even to Cogny at Hanoi \u2013 that de Castries was incompetent to conduct the defense of Dien Bien Phu. Even more critical, after the fall of the northern outposts, he isolated himself in his bunker so that he had, in effect, relinquished his command authority\".<ref name=\"d241\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|pp=240\u2013241}}</ref> On 17 March, Cogny attempted to fly into \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 to take command, but his plane was driven off by anti-aircraft fire. Cogny considered parachuting into the encircled garrison, but his staff talked him out of it.<ref name=\"d241\" />\n[[File:Xung phong.jpg|thumb|280px|Viet Minh soldiers launching an assault during the battle]]\n\nDe Castries' seclusion in his bunker, combined with his superiors' inability to replace him, created a leadership vacuum in the French command. On 24 March, an event took place which later became a matter of historical debate. The historian [[Bernard Fall]] records, based on Langlais' memoirs, that Colonel Langlais and his fellow paratroop commanders, all fully armed, confronted de Castries in his bunker on 24 March. They told him he would retain the appearance of command, but that Langlais would exercise it.{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=177}} De Castries is said by Fall to have accepted the arrangement without protest, although he did exercise some command functions thereafter. Phillip Davidson stated that the \"truth would seem to be that Langlais did take over effective command of Dien Bien Phu, and that Castries became 'commander emeritus' who transmitted messages to Hanoi and offered advice about matters in Dien Bien Phu\".{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=243}} [[Jules Roy]], however, makes no mention of this event, and [[Martin Windrow]] argues that the \"paratrooper putsch\" is unlikely to have ever happened. Both historians record that Langlais and [[Marcel Bigeard]] were known to be on good terms with their commanding officer.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|pp=441\u201344}}\n\nFrench aerial resupply took heavy losses from Viet Minh machine guns near the landing strip. On 27 March, the Hanoi air transport commander, Nicot, ordered that all supply deliveries be made from {{cvt|2000|m}} or higher; losses were expected to remain heavy.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=244}} The following day, De Castries ordered an attack against the Viet Minh AA machine guns {{cvt|3|km}} west of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7. Remarkably, the attack was a complete success, with 350 Viet Minh soldiers killed and seventeen AA machine guns destroyed (French estimate), while the French lost 20 killed and 97 wounded.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|pp=244\u201345}}\n\n=== 30 March \u2013 5 April assaults ===\n{{further|Operation Condor (1954)}}\n[[File:Dien Bien Phu zoom.svg|350px|thumbnail|Central French positions at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, late-March 1954.

Those two areas were held by five understrength battalions, composed of Frenchmen, Legionnaires, Vietnamese, North Africans, and Tais.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=245}} Gi\u00e1p planned to use the tactics from the ''Beatrice'' and ''Gabrielle'' skirmishes.\n\nAt 19:00 on 30 March, the Viet Minh 312th Division captured ''Dominique'' 1 and 2, making ''Dominique'' 3 the final outpost between the Viet Minh and the French general headquarters, as well as outflanking all positions east of the river.<ref name=\"d246\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=246}}</ref> At this point, the French 4th Colonial Artillery Regiment entered the fight, setting its [[Canon de 105 L mle 1936 Schneider|105&nbsp;mm howitzers]] to zero elevation and firing directly on the Viet Minh attackers, blasting huge holes in their ranks. Another group of French soldiers, near the airfield, opened fire on the Viet Minh with anti-aircraft machine guns, forcing the Viet Minh to retreat.<ref name=\"d246\" />\n\nThe Viet Minh's simultaneous attacks elsewhere were more successful. The 316th Division captured ''Eliane'' 1 from its Moroccan defenders, and half of ''Eliane'' 2 by midnight.<ref name=\"d247\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=247}}</ref> On the west side of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, the 308th attacked ''Huguette'' 7, and nearly succeeded in breaking through, but a French sergeant took charge of the defenders and sealed the breach.<ref name=\"d247\" />\n\nJust after midnight on 31 March, the French launched a counterattack against ''Eliane'' 2, and recaptured half of it. Langlais ordered another counterattack the following afternoon against ''Dominique'' 2 and ''Eliane'' 1, using virtually \"everybody left in the garrison who could be trusted to fight\".<ref name=\"d247\" /> The counterattacks allowed the French to retake ''Dominique'' 2 and ''Eliane'' 1, but the Viet Minh launched their own renewed assault. The French, who were exhausted and without reserves, fell back from both positions late in the afternoon.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=248}} Reinforcements were sent north from ''Isabelle'', but were attacked en route and fell back to ''Isabelle''.\n\n[[File:French M24s atr Dien Bien Phu.jpg|thumb|350px|The French deployed a small number of [[M24 Chaffee]] light tanks (US supplied) during the battle which they nicknamed \"[[Bison]]s\". The Viet Minh countered these with heavy artillery and rocket-propelled grenade launchers (RPGs).]]\n\nShortly after dark on 31 March, Langlais told Major [[Marcel Bigeard]], who was leading the defense at ''Eliane'', to fall back across the river. Bigeard refused, saying \"As long as I have one man alive I won't let go of ''Eliane'' 4. Otherwise, Dien Bien Phu is done for.\"<ref name=\"roy210\">{{harvnb|Roy|2002|p=210}}</ref> The night of 31 March, the 316th Division attacked ''Eliane'' 2. Just as it appeared the French were about to be overrun, a few French tanks arrived<!-- from where?? -->, and helped push the Viet Minh back. Smaller attacks on ''Eliane'' 4 were also pushed back. The Viet Minh briefly captured ''Huguette'' 7, only to be pushed back by a French counterattack at dawn on 1 April.<ref name=\"d253\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=253}}</ref>\n\nFighting continued in this manner over the next several nights. The Viet Minh repeatedly attacked ''Eliane'' 2, only to be beaten back. Repeated attempts to reinforce the French garrison by parachute drops were made, but had to be carried out by lone planes at irregular times to avoid excessive casualties from Viet Minh anti-aircraft fire. Some reinforcements did arrive, but not enough to replace French casualties.<ref name=\"d253\" />\n\n=== Trench warfare ===\n[[File:Dien Bien Phu002.jpg|thumb|French troops seeking cover in trenches.]]\n\nOn 5 April, after a long night of battle, French fighter-bombers and artillery inflicted particularly devastating losses on one Viet Minh regiment<!-- which one?? -->, which was caught on open ground. At that point, Gi\u00e1p decided to change tactics. Although Gi\u00e1p still had the same objective \u2013 to overrun French defenses east of the river \u2013 he decided to employ [[trench warfare|entrenchment and sapping]] to achieve it.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|pp=254\u201355}}\n\nOn 10 April, the French attempted to retake ''Eliane'' 1, which had been lost eleven days earlier. The loss posed a significant threat to ''Eliane'' 4, and the French wanted to eliminate that threat. The dawn attack, which Bigeard devised, began with a short, massive artillery barrage, followed by small unit [[infiltration tactics|infiltration attacks]], then mopping-up operations. ''Eliane'' 1 changed hands several times that day, but by the next morning the French had control of the strong point. The Viet Minh attempted to retake it on the evening of 12 April, but were pushed back.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=265}}\n\nAt this point, the morale of the Viet Minh soldiers was greatly lowered due to the massive casualties they had received from heavy French gunfire. During a period of stalemate from 15 April to 1 May, the French intercepted enemy radio messages which told of whole units refusing orders to attack, and Viet Minh prisoners in French hands said that they were told to advance or be shot by the officers and non-commissioned officers behind them,{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=256}} much like [[Order No. 227|Stalin's \"Not A Step Back!\" decree]] of WWII, under which troops were compelled to advance even in the face of withering enemy fire, and were strictly forbidden to retreat. Worse still, the Viet Minh lacked advanced medical treatment and care, with one captured fighter stating that, \"Nothing strikes at combat-morale like the knowledge that if wounded, the soldier will go uncared for\".{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=257}} Concerned about a potential mutiny from his troops, [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p|Gi\u00e1p]] had to call for fresh reinforcements from neighbouring Laos to bolster his dwindling and dispirited forces.\n\nDuring the fighting at ''Eliane'' 1, on the other side of camp, the Viet Minh entrenchments had almost entirely surrounded ''Huguette'' 1 and 6. On 11 April the garrison of ''Huguette'' 1, supported by artillery from ''Claudine'', launched an attack with the goal of resupplying ''Huguette'' 6 with water and ammunition. <!-- Confusing to start this paragraph by describing Viet Minh actions and suddenly shift to describing French actions&nbsp;\u2013 but without naming the forces in question. --> The attacks were repeated on the nights of the 14\u201315 and 16\u201317 April. While they did succeed in getting some supplies through, the French suffered heavy casualties, which convinced Langlais to abandon ''Huguette'' 6. Following a failed attempt to link up, on 18 April, the defenders at ''Huguette'' 6 made a daring break out, but only a few managed to make it to French lines.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=258}}{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=260}} The Viet Minh repeated the isolation and probing attacks against ''Huguette'' 1, and overran the fort on the morning of 22 April. After this key advance, the Viet Minh took control of more than 90 percent of the airfield, making accurate French parachute drops impossible.{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=270}} This caused the landing zone to become perilously small, and effectively choked off much needed supplies.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=259}} A French attack against ''Huguette'' 1 later that day was repulsed.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|pp=532\u2013533}}\n\n=== Isabelle ===\n''Isabelle'' saw only light action until 30 March, when the Viet Minh isolated it and beat back the attempt to send reinforcements north. Following a massive artillery barrage on 30 March, the Viet Minh began employing the same trench warfare tactics that they were using against the central camp. By the end of April, ''Isabelle'' had exhausted its water supply and was nearly out of ammunition.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=260}}\n\n=== Final attacks ===\nThe Viet Minh launched a massed assault against the exhausted defenders on the night of 1 May, overrunning ''Eliane'' 1, ''Dominique'' 3, and ''Huguette'' 5, although the French managed to beat back attacks on ''Eliane'' 2. On 6 May, the Viet Minh launched another massed attack against ''Eliane'' 2, using, for the first time, [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rockets]].<ref name=\"d236\" /> The French artillery fired a \"TOT\" ([[time on target]]) mission, so that artillery rounds fired from different positions would strike on target at the same time.<ref>Davidson, p. 261</ref> This barrage defeated the first assault wave, but later that night the Viet Minh detonated a mine under ''Eliane'' 2, with devastating effect. The Viet Minh attacked again, and within a few hours the defenders were overrun.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=262}}\n\nOn 7 May, Gi\u00e1p ordered an all-out attack against the remaining French units with over 25,000 Viet Minh against fewer than 3,000 garrison troops. At 17:00, de Castries radioed French headquarters in Hanoi and talked with Cogny. {{quote|De Castries: \"The Viets are everywhere. The situation is very grave. The combat is confused and goes on all about. I feel the end is approaching, but we will fight to the finish.\" <br /> Cogny: \"Of course you will fight to the end. It is out of the question to run up the white flag after your heroic resistance.\"<ref name=\"time\" />}}\n\nThe last radio transmission from the French headquarters reported that enemy troops were directly outside the headquarters bunker and that all the positions had been overrun. The radio operator in his last words stated: \"The enemy has overrun us. We are blowing up everything. ''Vive la France''!\" That night the garrison made a breakout attempt, in the [[Battle of Camar\u00f3n|Camar\u00f3n tradition]]. While some of the main body managed to break out, none succeeded in escaping the valley. At \"Isabelle\", a similar attempt later the same night saw about 70 troops, out of 1,700 men in the garrison, escape to Laos.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=269}} By about 18:20, only one French position, strong point Lily, manned by Moroccan soldiers commanded by a French officer, Major Jean Nicholas, had not been overrun.

It only assumed the aspect of a definitive defeat of our forces by reason of its profound psychological effects on French public opinion, which, tired of a war that was unpopular and seemingly without end, demanded in a way that it be ended.<br />\nThe event itself was in fact, both in terms of public opinion and of the military conduct of the war and operations, merely the end result of a long process of degradation of a faraway enterprise which, not having the assent of the nation, could not receive from the authorities the energetic impulse, and the size and continuity of efforts required for success.<br />\nIf, therefore, one wishes to establish objectively the responsibilities incurred in the final phase of the Indochina war one would have to examine its origins and evoke the acts and decisions of the various governments in power, that is to say their war policies, as well as the ways in which these policies were translated by the military commanders into operations.<ref>{{cite book|first=Arthur J. |last=Dommen|title=The Indochinese experience of the French and the Americans: nationalism and communism in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-253-33854-9|page=233}} citing ''Rapport concernant la conduite des op\u00e9rations en Indochine sous la direction du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Navarre'' as reproduced in G.

Gi\u00e1p's forces besieged Khe Sanh for 77 days. Historians are divided on whether this was a genuine attempt to repeat their success at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 by forcing the surrender of the Marine base, or else a diversion from the [[Tet Offensive|T\u1ebft Offensive]], or an example of the North Vietnamese Army keeping its options open. At Khe Sanh, a number of factors were significantly different from \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7. Khe Sanh was much closer to a US supply base ({{convert|45|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) compared to a French one at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 ({{convert|200|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Rottman|2005|p=8}}\n\nAt Khe Sanh, the U.S. Marines held the high ground, and their artillery forced the North Vietnamese to use their own artillery from a much greater distance. By contrast, at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, the French artillery (six [[105mm|105&nbsp;mm]] batteries and one battery of four [[155mm howitzers|155&nbsp;mm howitzers]] and mortars{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=480}}) was only sporadically effective.<ref name=\"Rottman p9\">{{harvnb|Rottman|2005|p=9}}</ref> Furthermore, by 1968, the US military presence in Vietnam dwarfed that of the French, and included numerous technological advances such as effective helicopters.\n\nKhe Sanh received 18,000 tons of aerial resupplies during the 77-day battle, whereas during the 167 days that the French forces at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 held out, they received only 4,000 tons.<ref name=\"Rottman p9\" /> Also, the [[US Air Force]] dropped 114,810 tons of bombs on the North Vietnamese at Khe Sanh, roughly as many as on Japan in 1945 during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Rottman|2005|p=10}}\n\n==Battlefield today==\nToday, the former battlefield is one large historical site. Former French fortified positions such as ''Beatrice'', ''Isabelle'', ''Eliane'', the [[Bailey bridge]] and [[De Castries]]' headquarters bunker have been preserved, all in relatively good condition. Nearly 30 kilometres away from the centre of Dien Bien Phu is the Viet Minh army complex containing shelters and trenches, also preserved in Muong Phang village.

In addition, monuments and memorials to both sides are situated across the region, as are the few remaining French [[M24 Chaffee|Chaffee]] tank wrecks scattered all throughout the valley, such as in the many rice paddy-fields of the area. Also, the same runway used by the French during the battle remains to this day and is still in active use, but is made of concrete.

[[First Indochina War]] that took place between 13 March and 7 May 1954. It was fought between the [[French Union]]'s [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] and [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh|Viet Minh]] [[Communism|communist]] [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]].\n\nIt was, from the French view before the event, a [[Pitched battle|set piece battle]] to draw out the Vietnamese and destroy them with superior firepower. As a result of blunders in French decision-making, however, the French began an operation to insert, then support, their soldiers at [[\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7]], deep in the hills of northwestern [[Vietnam]]. The operation's purpose was to cut off Viet Minh supply lines into the neighboring [[Kingdom of Laos]] (a French ally), and draw the Viet Minh into a major confrontation in order to cripple them. The plan was to resupply the French position by air, and was based on the belief that the Viet Minh had no [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft capability]]. The Viet Minh, however, under General [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]], surrounded and [[Siege|besieged]] the French. They brought in vast amounts of heavy artillery (including [[Antiaircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]]) and managed to move these bulky weapons through difficult terrain up the rear slopes of the mountains. The Viet Minh were then able to dig tunnels through the mountain, and emplaced the artillery pieces overlooking the French encampment.\n\nIn March, a massive artillery bombardment by the Viet Minh ensued. The strategic positioning of their artillery made it nearly impervious to French [[counter-battery fire]]. Tenacious fighting on the ground ensued, reminiscent of the [[trench warfare]] of World War I. At times, the French repulsed Viet Minh assaults on their positions while supplies and reinforcements were delivered by air. As key positions were overrun, the perimeter contracted, and the air resupply on which the French had placed their hopes became impossible. As the Viet Minh anti-aircraft fire took its toll, fewer and fewer of those supplies reached the French. The garrison was overrun in May after a two-month siege, and most of the French forces surrendered. A few of them escaped to [[Laos]]. The French government in Paris then resigned, and the new Prime Minister, the left-of-centre [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France]], supported French withdrawal from Indochina.\n\nThe Battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 was decisive; the war ended shortly afterward and the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Accords]] were signed. France agreed to withdraw its forces from all its colonies in [[French Indochina]], while stipulating that Vietnam would be temporarily divided at the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|17th parallel]], with control of the north given to the Viet Minh as the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]], and the south becoming the [[South Vietnam|State of Vietnam]], nominally under Emperor [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], preventing Ho Chi Minh from gaining control of the entire country.<ref>Nash, Gary B., Julie Roy Jeffrey, John R.

New York: Longman, 2007.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n=== Military situation ===\nBy 1953, the [[First Indochina War]] was not going well for France. A succession of commanders&nbsp;\u2013 [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]], [[Jean \u00c9tienne Valluy]], [[Roger Blaizot]], [[Marcel Carpentier]], [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]], and [[Raoul Salan]]&nbsp;\u2013 had proven incapable of suppressing the insurrection of the [[Viet Minh]] fighting for independence. During their 1952\u20131953 campaign, the Viet Minh had overrun vast swathes of [[Laos]], Vietnam's western neighbor, advancing as far as [[Luang Prabang]] and the [[Plain of Jars]]. The French were unable to slow the Viet Minh advance, who fell back only after outrunning their always-tenuous supply lines. In 1953, the French had begun to strengthen their defenses in the [[Hanoi]] delta region to prepare for a series of offensives against Viet Minh [[staging area]]s in northwest Vietnam. They set up fortified towns and outposts in the area, including [[Lai Ch\u00e2u]] near the Chinese border to the north,{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=23}} [[N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n]] to the west of Hanoi,{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=9}} and the Plain of Jars in northern Laos.{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=48}}\n\nIn May 1953, French Premier [[Ren\u00e9 Mayer]] appointed [[Henri Navarre]], a trusted colleague, to take command of [[French Union]] forces in Indochina. Mayer had given Navarre a single order\u2014to create military conditions that would lead to an \"honorable political solution\".<ref name=\"d165\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=165}}</ref> According to military scholar [[Phillip Davidson]],\n<blockquote> On arrival, Navarre was shocked by what he found. There had been no long-range plan since de Lattre's departure. Everything was conducted on a day-to-day, reactive basis. Combat operations were undertaken only in response to enemy moves or threats. There was no comprehensive plan to develop the organization and build up the equipment of the Expeditionary force. Finally, Navarre, the intellectual, the cold and professional soldier, was shocked by the \"school's out\" attitude of [[Raoul Salan|Salan]] and his senior commanders and staff officers. They were going home, not as victors or heroes, but then, not as clear losers either. To them the important thing was that they were getting out of Indochina with their reputations frayed, but intact. They gave little thought to, or concern for, the problems of their successors.<ref name=\"d165\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n and the hedgehog concept ===\n{{details|Battle of N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n}}\nNavarre began searching for a way to stop the Viet Minh threat to Laos. Colonel Louis Berteil, commander of Mobile Group 7 and Navarre's main planner,{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=44}} formulated the ''h\u00e9risson'' ('[[hedgehog defence|hedgehog]]') concept. The French army would establish a fortified [[airhead (warfare)|airhead]] by airlifting soldiers to positions adjacent to key Viet Minh supply lines to Laos.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=173}} They would cut off Viet Minh soldiers fighting in Laos and force them to withdraw. \"It was an attempt to interdict the enemy's rear area, to stop the flow of supplies and reinforcements, to establish a redoubt in the enemy's rear and disrupt his lines\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Kennedy |first= Bruce |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/11/spotlight |title=1954 battle changed Vietnam's history |website=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219033545/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/11/spotlight |archivedate=19 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe hedgehog concept was based on French experiences at the [[Battle of N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n]]. In late November and early December 1952, Gi\u00e1p had attacked the French outpost at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n, which was essentially an \"air-land base\", a fortified camp supplied only by air.{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=24}} The French had beaten back Gi\u00e1p's forces repeatedly, inflicting very heavy losses on them.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|p=125}} The French hoped that by repeating the strategy on a much larger scale, they would be able to lure Gi\u00e1p into committing the bulk of his forces to a massed assault. This would enable superior French artillery, armor, and air support to decimate the exposed Viet Minh forces.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|pp=216\u2013217}} The success at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n convinced Navarre of the viability of the fortified airhead concept.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|p=222}}\n\nFrench staff officers failed to treat seriously several crucial differences between \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 and N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n:\nFirst, at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n, the French commanded most of the high ground with overwhelming artillery support.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=147}} At \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, however, the Viet Minh controlled much of the high ground around the valley, their artillery far exceeded French expectations, and they outnumbered the French troops four to one.<ref name=\"d224\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1988|p=224}}</ref> Gi\u00e1p compared \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 to a \"rice bowl\", where his troops occupied the edge and the French the bottom.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|p=258}} Second, Gi\u00e1p made a mistake at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n by committing his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|p=258}} He learned his lesson: at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, Gi\u00e1p spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Artillery pieces were sited within well-constructed and camouflaged [[casemate]]s. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns Gi\u00e1p possessed.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|pp=291\u2013292}} Third, the aerial resupply lines at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n were never severed, despite Viet Minh anti-aircraft fire.

Artillery as well as ten US [[M24 Chaffee]] light tanks (each broken down into 180 individual parts, flown into the base, and then re-assembled) and numerous aircraft (attack and supply types) were committed to the garrison.

The Viet Minh positioned their five divisions (the 304th, 308th, 312th, 316th, and 351st) in the surrounding areas to the north and east. From these areas, the Viet Minh artillery had a clear line of sight to the French fortifications and were able to accurately target the French positions.]]\n\nThe Viet Minh assault began in earnest on 13 March 1954 with an attack on the northeastern outpost, ''B\u00e9atrice'', which was held by the 3rd Battalion, 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade. Viet Minh artillery opened a fierce bombardment with two batteries each of 105{{nbsp}}mm howitzers, 120{{nbsp}}mm mortars, and 75{{nbsp}}mm mountain guns (plus seventeen 57{{nbsp}}mm recoilless rifles and numerous 60{{nbsp}}mm and 81/82{{nbsp}}mm mortars). French command was disrupted at 18:30 when a shell hit the French command post, killing the battalion commander, Major Paul P\u00e9got, and most of his staff. A few minutes later, Lieutenant colonel [[Jules Gaucher]], commander of the entire central subsector, was also killed by artillery fire. The Viet Minh 312th Division then launched an assault with its 141st and 209th Infantry Regiments, using [[sapper]]s to breach the French obstacles.\n\n''B\u00e9atrice'' comprised three separate strong points forming a triangle with the point facing north. In the southeast, strong point ''Beatrice''-3, its defenses smashed by 75{{nbsp}}mm mountain guns firing at point-blank range, was quickly overrun by the 209th Regiment's 130th Battalion. In the north, most of ''Beatrice''-1 was swiftly conquered by the 141st Regiment's 428th Battalion, but the defenders held out in corner of the position for a time because the attackers thought they had captured the entire strong point when they encountered an internal barbed wire barrier in the dark. In the southwest, the assault on ''Beatrice''-2 by the 141st Regiment's 11th Battalion did not fare well because its assault trenches were too shallow and portions of them had been flattened by French artillery. Its efforts to breach ''Beatrice''-2's barbed wire were stalled for hours by flanking fire from ''Beatrice''-1 and several previously-undetected bunkers on ''Beatrice''-2 that had been spared by the bombardment. The holdouts on ''Beatrice''-1 were eliminated by 22:30, and the 141st Regiment's 11th and 16th Battalions finally broke into ''Beatrice''-2 an hour later, though the strong point was not entirely taken until after 01:00 on 14 March.{{sfn|Boylan|Olivier|2018|pp=78\u201383}} Roughly 350 French legionnaires were killed, wounded, or captured.

Indirect artillery, generally held as being far superior to direct fire, requires experienced, well-trained crews and good communications, which the Viet Minh lacked.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=227}} Navarre wrote that, \"Under the influence of Chinese advisers, the Viet Minh commanders had used processes quite different from the classic methods. The artillery had been dug in by single pieces...They were installed in shellproof dugouts, and fire point-blank from portholes...

For weeks, Gi\u00e1p had distributed subversive propaganda leaflets, telling the Tais that this was not their fight. The fall of ''Beatrice'' and ''Gabrielle'' had demoralized them. On the morning of 17 March, under the cover of fog, the bulk of the Tais left or defected. The French and the few remaining Tais on ''Anne-Marie'' were then forced to withdraw.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=239}}\n\n=== Lull ===\nA lull in fighting occurred from 17 to 30 March. The Viet Minh further tightened the noose around the French central area (formed by the strong points ''Huguette'', ''Dominique'', ''Claudine'', and ''Eliane''), effectively cutting off ''Isabelle'' and its 1,809 personnel to the south.{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=279}} During this lull, the French suffered from a serious crisis of command. \"It had become painfully evident to the senior officers within the encircled garrison \u2013 and even to Cogny at Hanoi \u2013 that de Castries was incompetent to conduct the defense of Dien Bien Phu.

On 24 March, an event took place which later became a matter of historical debate. The historian [[Bernard Fall]] records, based on Langlais' memoirs, that Colonel Langlais and his fellow paratroop commanders, all fully armed, confronted de Castries in his bunker on 24 March. They told him he would retain the appearance of command, but that Langlais would exercise it.{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=177}} De Castries is said by Fall to have accepted the arrangement without protest, although he did exercise some command functions thereafter. Phillip Davidson stated that the \"truth would seem to be that Langlais did take over effective command of Dien Bien Phu, and that Castries became 'commander emeritus' who transmitted messages to Hanoi and offered advice about matters in Dien Bien Phu\".{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=243}} [[Jules Roy]], however, makes no mention of this event, and [[Martin Windrow]] argues that the \"paratrooper putsch\" is unlikely to have ever happened. Both historians record that Langlais and [[Marcel Bigeard]] were known to be on good terms with their commanding officer.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|pp=441\u201344}}\n\nFrench aerial resupply took heavy losses from Viet Minh machine guns near the landing strip.

The Viet Minh repeatedly attacked ''Eliane'' 2, only to be beaten back.

Some reinforcements did arrive, but not enough to replace French casualties.<ref name=\"d253\" />\n\n=== Trench warfare ===\n[[File:Dien Bien Phu002.jpg|thumb|French troops seeking cover in trenches.]]\n\nOn 5 April, after a long night of battle, French fighter-bombers and artillery inflicted particularly devastating losses on one Viet Minh regiment<!-- which one?? -->, which was caught on open ground. At that point, Gi\u00e1p decided to change tactics. Although Gi\u00e1p still had the same objective \u2013 to overrun French defenses east of the river \u2013 he decided to employ [[trench warfare|entrenchment and sapping]] to achieve it.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|pp=254\u201355}}\n\nOn 10 April, the French attempted to retake ''Eliane'' 1, which had been lost eleven days earlier. The loss posed a significant threat to ''Eliane'' 4, and the French wanted to eliminate that threat. The dawn attack, which Bigeard devised, began with a short, massive artillery barrage, followed by small unit [[infiltration tactics|infiltration attacks]], then mopping-up operations. ''Eliane'' 1 changed hands several times that day, but by the next morning the French had control of the strong point. The Viet Minh attempted to retake it on the evening of 12 April, but were pushed back.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=265}}\n\nAt this point, the morale of the Viet Minh soldiers was greatly lowered due to the massive casualties they had received from heavy French gunfire. During a period of stalemate from 15 April to 1 May, the French intercepted enemy radio messages which told of whole units refusing orders to attack, and Viet Minh prisoners in French hands said that they were told to advance or be shot by the officers and non-commissioned officers behind them,{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=256}} much like [[Order No. 227|Stalin's \"Not A Step Back!\" decree]] of WWII, under which troops were compelled to advance even in the face of withering enemy fire, and were strictly forbidden to retreat. Worse still, the Viet Minh lacked advanced medical treatment and care, with one captured fighter stating that, \"Nothing strikes at combat-morale like the knowledge that if wounded, the soldier will go uncared for\".{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=257}} Concerned about a potential mutiny from his troops, [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p|Gi\u00e1p]] had to call for fresh reinforcements from neighbouring Laos to bolster his dwindling and dispirited forces.\n\nDuring the fighting at ''Eliane'' 1, on the other side of camp, the Viet Minh entrenchments had almost entirely surrounded ''Huguette'' 1 and 6. On 11 April the garrison of ''Huguette'' 1, supported by artillery from ''Claudine'', launched an attack with the goal of resupplying ''Huguette'' 6 with water and ammunition. <!-- Confusing to start this paragraph by describing Viet Minh actions and suddenly shift to describing French actions&nbsp;\u2013 but without naming the forces in question. --> The attacks were repeated on the nights of the 14\u201315 and 16\u201317 April. While they did succeed in getting some supplies through, the French suffered heavy casualties, which convinced Langlais to abandon ''Huguette'' 6. Following a failed attempt to link up, on 18 April, the defenders at ''Huguette'' 6 made a daring break out, but only a few managed to make it to French lines.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=258}}{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=260}} The Viet Minh repeated the isolation and probing attacks against ''Huguette'' 1, and overran the fort on the morning of 22 April. After this key advance, the Viet Minh took control of more than 90 percent of the airfield, making accurate French parachute drops impossible.{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=270}} This caused the landing zone to become perilously small, and effectively choked off much needed supplies.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=259}} A French attack against ''Huguette'' 1 later that day was repulsed.{{sfn|Windrow|2004|pp=532\u2013533}}\n\n=== Isabelle ===\n''Isabelle'' saw only light action until 30 March, when the Viet Minh isolated it and beat back the attempt to send reinforcements north. Following a massive artillery barrage on 30 March, the Viet Minh began employing the same trench warfare tactics that they were using against the central camp. By the end of April, ''Isabelle'' had exhausted its water supply and was nearly out of ammunition.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=260}}\n\n=== Final attacks ===\nThe Viet Minh launched a massed assault against the exhausted defenders on the night of 1 May, overrunning ''Eliane'' 1, ''Dominique'' 3, and ''Huguette'' 5, although the French managed to beat back attacks on ''Eliane'' 2. On 6 May, the Viet Minh launched another massed attack against ''Eliane'' 2, using, for the first time, [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rockets]].<ref name=\"d236\" /> The French artillery fired a \"TOT\" ([[time on target]]) mission, so that artillery rounds fired from different positions would strike on target at the same time.<ref>Davidson, p. 261</ref> This barrage defeated the first assault wave, but later that night the Viet Minh detonated a mine under ''Eliane'' 2, with devastating effect. The Viet Minh attacked again, and within a few hours the defenders were overrun.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=262}}\n\nOn 7 May, Gi\u00e1p ordered an all-out attack against the remaining French units with over 25,000 Viet Minh against fewer than 3,000 garrison troops. At 17:00, de Castries radioed French headquarters in Hanoi and talked with Cogny. {{quote|De Castries: \"The Viets are everywhere. The situation is very grave. The combat is confused and goes on all about. I feel the end is approaching, but we will fight to the finish.\" <br /> Cogny: \"Of course you will fight to the end. It is out of the question to run up the white flag after your heroic resistance.\"<ref name=\"time\" />}}\n\nThe last radio transmission from the French headquarters reported that enemy troops were directly outside the headquarters bunker and that all the positions had been overrun. The radio operator in his last words stated: \"The enemy has overrun us. We are blowing up everything. ''Vive la France''!\" That night the garrison made a breakout attempt, in the [[Battle of Camar\u00f3n|Camar\u00f3n tradition]]. While some of the main body managed to break out, none succeeded in escaping the valley. At \"Isabelle\", a similar attempt later the same night saw about 70 troops, out of 1,700 men in the garrison, escape to Laos.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|p=269}} By about 18:20, only one French position, strong point Lily, manned by Moroccan soldiers commanded by a French officer, Major Jean Nicholas, had not been overrun.

At Khe Sanh, a number of factors were significantly different from \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7. Khe Sanh was much closer to a US supply base ({{convert|45|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) compared to a French one at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 ({{convert|200|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Rottman|2005|p=8}}\n\nAt Khe Sanh, the U.S. Marines held the high ground, and their artillery forced the North Vietnamese to use their own artillery from a much greater distance. By contrast, at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, the French artillery (six [[105mm|105&nbsp;mm]] batteries and one battery of four [[155mm howitzers|155&nbsp;mm howitzers]] and mortars{{sfn|Fall|1967|p=480}}) was only sporadically effective.<ref name=\"Rottman p9\">{{harvnb|Rottman|2005|p=9}}</ref> Furthermore, by 1968, the US military presence in Vietnam dwarfed that of the French, and included numerous technological advances such as effective helicopters.\n\nKhe Sanh received 18,000 tons of aerial resupplies during the 77-day battle, whereas during the 167 days that the French forces at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 held out, they received only 4,000 tons.<ref name=\"Rottman p9\" /> Also, the [[US Air Force]] dropped 114,810 tons of bombs on the North Vietnamese at Khe Sanh, roughly as many as on Japan in 1945 during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Rottman|2005|p=10}}\n\n==Battlefield today==\nToday, the former battlefield is one large historical site.

In addition, monuments and memorials to both sides are situated across the region, as are the few remaining French [[M24 Chaffee|Chaffee]] tank wrecks scattered all throughout the valley, such as in the many rice paddy-fields of the area.

He inherited the title of 24th Marcher Lord of Cemaes, which gave him authority to hold a Court Leet and other ceremonial occasions such as beating the bounds at [[Newport, Pembrokeshire]]. Very little authority rested with these ancient privileges by this time although he has the right to appoint the Mayor of Newport. Lloyd spent a fortune on the renovation of Newport Castle as the seat of his 'marcher lordship' and seeking elevation to the peerage. He had to be content with being created a [[baronet]] in 1863.\n\n==Political career==\nThroughout the 1850s, Lloyd was frequently named as a potential candidate for election to the House of Commons, either to represent [[Cardigan Boroughs]] or the more prestigious [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiganshire]] county constituency. However, he was constantly reluctant to face a contested election, possibly for reasons of cost as his extravagance in rebuilding both Newport Castle and Bronwydd left the estate heavily indebted, but also due to his reluctance to create divisions among the predominantly Conservative landed gentry of Cardiganshire. For several decades, and unofficial understanding saw the county seat had been held by a Conservative while the Whig-supporting Pryse family of Gogerddan held the borough seat.

However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. This reflected the fact that the Powell family, with one short interval in the 1850s, had held the county seat since 1816 and their claim to the seat had been widely accepted by the landowners of the county.{{refn|In his article on the Cardiganshire election of 1865, widely regarded as the definitive account, Ieuan Gwynedd Jones makes no reference to Lloyd's refusal to oppose Powell in 1859 on the grounds that he did not wish to oppose another member of the landed gentry.{{sfn|Jones|1964}} The same reasons, presumably, explain Lloyd's temporary withdrawal in 1865|group= n}} The result was that both [[Henry Richard]] and [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies, Llandinam]] offered themselves as alternative Liberal candidates. A selection meeting was arranged to be held at Aberaeron, but shortly before this took place, Powell again announced his retirement.

He inherited the title of 24th Marcher Lord of Cemaes, which gave him authority to hold a Court Leet and other ceremonial occasions such as beating the bounds at [[Newport, Pembrokeshire]]. Very little authority rested with these ancient privileges by this time although he has the right to appoint the Mayor of Newport. Lloyd spent a fortune on the renovation of Newport Castle as the seat of his 'marcher lordship' and seeking elevation to the peerage. He had to be content with being created a [[baronet]] in 1863.\n\n==Political career==\nThroughout the 1850s, Lloyd was frequently named as a potential candidate for election to the House of Commons, either to represent [[Cardigan Boroughs]] or the more prestigious [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiganshire]] county constituency. However, he was constantly reluctant to face a contested election, possibly for reasons of cost as his extravagance in rebuilding both Newport Castle and Bronwydd left the estate heavily indebted, but also due to his reluctance to create divisions among the predominantly Conservative landed gentry of Cardiganshire. For several decades, and unofficial understanding saw the county seat had been held by a Conservative while the Whig-supporting Pryse family of Gogerddan held the borough seat. Evatually, Lloyd served for a single term as member for both the county (1865\u201368) and the boroughs (1868-74)\n\n===Early political activity===\nAn old fashioned [[British Whig Party|Whig]] Liberal, Lloyd was first mooted as a Liberal parliamentary candidate in 1852, when there was a requisition urging him to contest the [[Cardigan Boroughs]] in opposition to Pryse Loveden of Gogerddan.<ref name=\"W 26-3-52\">{{cite news |title=Cardiganshire |url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4347584/4347587/19/ |accessdate=20 November 2019 |newspaper=Welshman |date=26 March 1852 |page=5}}</ref> He declined.

However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. This reflected the fact that the Powell family, with one short interval in the 1850s, had held the county seat since 1816 and their claim to the seat had been widely accepted by the landowners of the county.{{refn|In his article on the Cardiganshire election of 1865, widely regarded as the definitive account, Ieuan Gwynedd Jones makes no reference to Lloyd's refusal to oppose Powell in 1859 on the grounds that he did not wish to oppose another member of the landed gentry.{{sfn|Jones|1964}} The same reasons, presumably, explain Lloyd's temporary withdrawal in 1865|group= n}} The result was that both [[Henry Richard]] and [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies, Llandinam]] offered themselves as alternative Liberal candidates.

Though the character of Lurch was originally intended to be mute, when Cassidy ad-libbed \"You rang?\" in response to the butler call, the subtle humor and the deepness of his voice was immediately a hit. \"You rang\" became his signature line, and more speaking parts were written for him. Several episodes were written to feature Lurch.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.legacy.com/news/legends-and-legacies/ted-cassidy-you-rang/1886/|title=Ted Cassidy, You Rang?|work=Legacy.com}}</ref>\n\nCassidy would reprise the role of Lurch in later appearances. In the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episode \"The Penguin's Nest\" (1966), he appears during the heroes' familiar climb scene up the side of a building, as a tenant who is playing the ''Addam's Family'' theme on harpsichord prior to sticking his head out of the window and speaking to Batman and Robin. He voiced Lurch in an episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' (1972), and in the 1973 animated series adaptation of ''[[The Addams Family (1973 animated series)|The Addams Family]]''.\n\nIn addition to ''The Addams Family'', Cassidy found steady work in a variety of other television shows.<ref name=btkfsmh /> He had a prominent role on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' as Injun Joe, the blood-foe of Tom Sawyer and Huck. In the 1967 ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' episode \"The Napoleon's Tomb Affair\", Cassidy played a henchman, Edgar, who kidnaps, tortures, and repeatedly tries to kill Napoleon and Illya. \n\nCassidy also provided the voices of the more aggressive version of Balok in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode \"[[The Corbomite Maneuver]]\" and the [[Gorn]] in the episode \"[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]\",  and played the part of the android Ruk in the episode \"[[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]]\". Cassidy did more work with ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] in the early 1970s, playing Isaiah in the [[post-apocalyptic]] drama pilots ''[[Genesis II (film)|Genesis II]]'' and ''[[Planet Earth (TV pilot)|Planet Earth]]''. In the ''[[Lost in Space]]'' episode, \"The Thief from Outer Space\", he played the Slave to the alien Thief ([[Malachi Throne]]) who threatens the Robinsons.\n\nIn ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' episode \"The Dahlia Feud\" from 1967, he played Mr. Ted, a large, muscular gardener who was planting [[dahlia]]s for Mrs. Drysdale. In 1968, Cassidy appeared on ''[[Mannix]]'' in the episode [[Mannix (season 1)|\"To Kill a Writer\"]] as Felipe Montoya, on ''[[Daniel Boone (1964 TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' in \"The Scrimshaw Ivory Chart\" as a pirate named Gentle Sam, and in two episodes of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' as the master of Jeannie's devious sister in the episode \"Genie, Genie, Who's Got the Genie?\", and Jeannie's cousin in the episode \"Please Don't Feed the Astronauts\".\n\nIn the two-part ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' episode \"The Return of Bigfoot\" (1976), Cassidy performed as the body and vocal effects of [[Bigfoot]] (the role was originally played by professional wrestler [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] in a previous two-parter). Cassidy reprised the role in the 1977 episode \"Bigfoot V\".\n\n===Film work===\nConcurrent with his appearances on ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', Cassidy began doing character voices on a recurring basis for the [[Hanna-Barbera]] Studios, culminating in the role of Frankenstein, Jr. in ''[[Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles]]'' series. He was the voice of ''Meteor Man'' in ''[[Birdman and the Galaxy Trio]]'', as well as the hero in the [[Chuck Menville]] pixillated short film ''[[Blaze Glory]]'', in which his already-deep voice was enhanced with reverb echo to give the character an exaggerated super-hero sound. Cassidy also voiced Ben Grimm (\"The Thing\") in ''[[The New Fantastic Four]]''. Cassidy went on to perform the roars and growls for [[Godzilla (animated series)|Godzilla]] in the 1979 cartoon series that Hanna Barbera co-produced with [[Toho]]; and was also the voice of Montaro in the ''[[Jana of the Jungle]]'' segments that accompanied [[Godzilla]] during its first network run.  His was the basis for the sinister voice of [[Black Manta]], as well as [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] and several others on ''[[Super Friends]]''. Cassidy was the original voice of [[Moltar]] and [[List of Space Ghost Coast to Coast characters|Metallus]] on ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'' from 1966 to 1968. Cassidy's final role was as King Thun of the Lion Men in the [[Filmation]] television animated feature film, ''[[Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All]]''. That particular role was originally recorded shortly before Cassidy's death in 1979 until the decision was made to use the footage for a television series, ''[[The New Adventures of Flash Gordon]]''. As such, Cassidy's death necessitated his role being recast for the series with [[Allan Melvin]]. After the series' conclusion, the original feature film and soundtrack were reassembled and broadcast in prime time in 1982 with Cassidy's performance used.\n\nAfter ''The Addams Family'', on the TV series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', he provided narration of the title sequence, and the Hulk's growls and roars.\n\nIn deleted scenes from the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' TV pilot movie, \"[[Saga of a Star World]]\", Cassidy can be heard providing temporary voice tracks of the [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] [[Imperious Leader]], before actor [[Patrick Macnee]] was contracted to voice the character.<ref>{{cite video | type=DVD | title=Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Epic Series | origyear=1978}}</ref>\n\nOther film work includes ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969), ''[[Mackenna's Gold]]'' (1969), ''The Limit'' (1972), ''[[Black Rage (film)|Charcoal Black]]'' (1972), ''[[The Slams]]'' (1973), ''Thunder County'' (1974), ''[[Poor Pretty Eddie]]'' (1975), ''[[Harry and Walter Go to New York]]'' (1976), ''[[The Last Remake of Beau Geste]]'' (1977) and ''[[Goin' Coconuts]]'' (1978). He co-wrote the screenplay of 1973's ''[[The Harrad Experiment]]'', in which he made a brief appearance.\n\nIn 1965, he released a seven-inch vinyl record on Capitol Records with two songs on it: \"The Lurch\", written by [[Gary S.

Cassidy did more work with ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] in the early 1970s, playing Isaiah in the [[post-apocalyptic]] drama pilots ''[[Genesis II (film)|Genesis II]]'' and ''[[Planet Earth (TV pilot)|Planet Earth]]''. In the ''[[Lost in Space]]'' episode, \"The Thief from Outer Space\", he played the Slave to the alien Thief ([[Malachi Throne]]) who threatens the Robinsons.\n\nIn ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' episode \"The Dahlia Feud\" from 1967, he played Mr. Ted, a large, muscular gardener who was planting [[dahlia]]s for Mrs. Drysdale. In 1968, Cassidy appeared on ''[[Mannix]]'' in the episode [[Mannix (season 1)|\"To Kill a Writer\"]] as Felipe Montoya, on ''[[Daniel Boone (1964 TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' in \"The Scrimshaw Ivory Chart\" as a pirate named Gentle Sam, and in two episodes of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' as the master of Jeannie's devious sister in the episode \"Genie, Genie, Who's Got the Genie?\", and Jeannie's cousin in the episode \"Please Don't Feed the Astronauts\".\n\nIn the two-part ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' episode \"The Return of Bigfoot\" (1976), Cassidy performed as the body and vocal effects of [[Bigfoot]] (the role was originally played by professional wrestler [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] in a previous two-parter). Cassidy reprised the role in the 1977 episode \"Bigfoot V\".\n\n===Film work===\nConcurrent with his appearances on ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', Cassidy began doing character voices on a recurring basis for the [[Hanna-Barbera]] Studios, culminating in the role of Frankenstein, Jr. in ''[[Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles]]'' series. He was the voice of ''Meteor Man'' in ''[[Birdman and the Galaxy Trio]]'', as well as the hero in the [[Chuck Menville]] pixillated short film ''[[Blaze Glory]]'', in which his already-deep voice was enhanced with reverb echo to give the character an exaggerated super-hero sound. Cassidy also voiced Ben Grimm (\"The Thing\") in ''[[The New Fantastic Four]]''. Cassidy went on to perform the roars and growls for [[Godzilla (animated series)|Godzilla]] in the 1979 cartoon series that Hanna Barbera co-produced with [[Toho]]; and was also the voice of Montaro in the ''[[Jana of the Jungle]]'' segments that accompanied [[Godzilla]] during its first network run.  His was the basis for the sinister voice of [[Black Manta]], as well as [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] and several others on ''[[Super Friends]]''. Cassidy was the original voice of [[Moltar]] and [[List of Space Ghost Coast to Coast characters|Metallus]] on ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'' from 1966 to 1968. Cassidy's final role was as King Thun of the Lion Men in the [[Filmation]] television animated feature film, ''[[Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All]]''. That particular role was originally recorded shortly before Cassidy's death in 1979 until the decision was made to use the footage for a television series, ''[[The New Adventures of Flash Gordon]]''. As such, Cassidy's death necessitated his role being recast for the series with [[Allan Melvin]]. After the series' conclusion, the original feature film and soundtrack were reassembled and broadcast in prime time in 1982 with Cassidy's performance used.\n\nAfter ''The Addams Family'', on the TV series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', he provided narration of the title sequence, and the Hulk's growls and roars.\n\nIn deleted scenes from the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' TV pilot movie, \"[[Saga of a Star World]]\", Cassidy can be heard providing temporary voice tracks of the [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] [[Imperious Leader]], before actor [[Patrick Macnee]] was contracted to voice the character.<ref>{{cite video | type=DVD | title=Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Epic Series | origyear=1978}}</ref>\n\nOther film work includes ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969), ''[[Mackenna's Gold]]'' (1969), ''The Limit'' (1972), ''[[Black Rage (film)|Charcoal Black]]'' (1972), ''[[The Slams]]'' (1973), ''Thunder County'' (1974), ''[[Poor Pretty Eddie]]'' (1975), ''[[Harry and Walter Go to New York]]'' (1976), ''[[The Last Remake of Beau Geste]]'' (1977) and ''[[Goin' Coconuts]]'' (1978). He co-wrote the screenplay of 1973's ''[[The Harrad Experiment]]'', in which he made a brief appearance.\n\nIn 1965, he released a seven-inch vinyl record on Capitol Records with two songs on it: \"The Lurch\", written by [[Gary S. Paxton]], and \"Wesley\", written by [[Cliffie Stone]] and Scott Turner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ted Cassidy: The Lurch/Wesley|publisher=[[Discogs]]|url=https://www.discogs.com/Ted-Cassidy-The-Lurch-Wesley/release/1853174}}</ref> He introduced the dance and performed the song \"The Lurch\" on September 11, 1965, on ''[[Shivaree (TV series)|Shivaree!]]'' and performed it again on Halloween of the same year on ''[[Shindig!]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2017/05/19/the-foote-files-remembering-ted-cassidy/|publisher=[[CBS]]|title=The Foote Files: Remembering Ted Cassidy|author=Foote, Ken|date=May 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nCassidy underwent surgery at [[St. Vincent Medical Center (Los Angeles)|St. Vincent Medical Center]] in Los Angeles to have a non-malignant tumor removed from his heart.
