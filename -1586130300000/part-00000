Wilson, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who previously served as the [[governor of New Jersey]], took office as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|28th]] U.S. President after winning the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 presidential election]], gaining a large majority in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and a 42% plurality of the popular vote in a four\u2013candidate field. Wilson was re-elected in [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]], defeating [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]] by a fairly narrow margin. He was the first [[Southern United States|Southerner]] to be elected president since [[Zachary Taylor]] in [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]], and just the second Democrat to be elected president since [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]].\n\nWilson was a leading force in the [[Progressive Movement]], and during his first term, he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the [[New Deal]] in the 1930s. Taking office one month after the ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment of the Constitution]] permitted a federal income tax, he helped pass the [[Revenue Act of 1913]], which reintroduced a federal [[Income Tax in the United States|income tax]] to lower [[Tariffs in United States history|tariff rates]]. Other major progressive legislations passed during Wilson's first term include the [[Federal Reserve Act]], the [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914]], the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]], and the [[Federal Farm Loan Act]]. While the passing of the [[Adamson Act]] \u2014 which imposed an 8-hour workday for railroads - he averted a railroad strike and an ensuing economic crisis. Concerning race issues, Wilson's administration enforced [[segregation in the United States|segregationist]] policies for government agencies. Upon the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, Wilson maintained a policy of neutrality, while pursuing a [[United States involvement in the Mexican Revolution|moralistic policy]] in dealing with [[Mexican Revolution|Mexico's civil war]].\n\nWilson's second term was dominated by the [[American entry into World War I|America's entry into]] [[World War I]] and that war's [[Aftermath of World War I|aftermath]]. In April 1917, when Germany resumed [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], Wilson asked Congress to declare war in order to make \"the world safe for democracy.\" Through the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], conscription sent 10,000 freshly trained soldiers to France per day by summer 1918. On the home front, Wilson raised income taxes, set up the [[War Industries Board]], promoted [[Labor history of the United States|labor union]] cooperation, regulated agriculture and food production through the [[Food and Fuel Control Act|Lever Act]], and nationalized the nation's railroad system. In his 1915 State of the Union, Wilson asked Congress for what became the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], suppressing anti-draft activists. The crackdown [[Palmer Raids|was later intensified]] by Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] to include expulsion of non-citizen radicals during the [[First Red Scare]] of 1919\u20131920. Wilson infused morality into his internationalism, an ideology now referred to as \"[[Wilsonian]]\"\u2014an activist foreign policy calling on the nation to promote global democracy.<ref>{{cite book |first=John Morton |last=Blum |title=Woodrow Wilson and the Politics of Morality |url=https://archive.org/details/woodrowwilsonpol0000blum |url-access=registration |year=1956 |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Richard M. |last=Gamble |title=Savior Nation: Woodrow Wilson and the Gospel of Service |journal=Humanitas |volume=14 |issue=1 |year=2001 |pages=4\u201322 |doi= |jstor= |url=http://www.nhinet.org/gamble14-1.pdf }}</ref> In early 1918, he issued his principles for peace, the ''[[Fourteen Points]],'' and in 1919, following the signing of an [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice with Germany]], he traveled to Paris, concluding the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Wilson embarked on a nationwide tour to campaign for the treaty, which would have included U.S. entrance into the [[League of Nations]], but was left incapacitated by a stroke in October 1919 and saw the treaty defeated in the Senate.\n\nDespite grave doubts about his health and mental capacity, Wilson served the remainder of his second term and unsuccessfully sought his party's nomination for a third term. In the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 presidential election]], Republican [[Warren G. Harding]] defeated Democratic nominee [[James M. Cox]] in a landslide, and Harding succeeded Wilson in March 1921. [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|Historians and political scientists]] rank Wilson as an above-average president, and his presidency was an important forerunner of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. However, Wilson has also been criticized for his racist views and actions.\n\n==Presidential election of 1912==\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1912}}\n\nWilson became a prominent 1912 presidential contender immediately upon his election as [[Governor of New Jersey]] in 1910, and his clashes with state party bosses enhanced his reputation with the rising [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive movement]].<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Prior to the [[1912 Democratic National Convention]], Wilson made a special effort to win the approval of three-time Democratic presidential nominee [[William Jennings Bryan]], whose followers had largely dominated the Democratic Party since the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]].<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 141\u2013142</ref> Speaker of the House [[Champ Clark]] of Missouri was viewed by many as the front-runner for the nomination, while House Majority Leader [[Oscar Underwood]] of Alabama also loomed as a challenger. Clark found support among the Bryan wing of the party, while Underwood appealed to the conservative [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, especially in the South.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 149\u2013150</ref> On the first ballot of the Democratic National Convention, Clark won a plurality of delegates, and on the tenth ballot, he won a majority of the delegates after the New York [[Tammany Hall]] machine swung behind him. However, the Democratic Party required a nominee to win two-thirds of the delegates to win the nomination, and balloting continued.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 155\u2013156</ref> The Wilson campaign picked up delegates by promising the vice presidency to Governor [[Thomas R. Marshall]] of Indiana, and several Southern delegations shifted their support from Underwood to Wilson, a native Southerner. Wilson finally won two-thirds of the vote on the convention's 46th ballot, and Marshall became Wilson's running mate.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 157\u2013158</ref>\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1912.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|1912 Electoral Vote Map]]\n\nWilson faced two major opponents in the 1912 general election: one-term Republican incumbent [[William Howard Taft]], and former Republican President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who ran a [[third party (United States)|third party]] campaign as the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|\"Bull Moose\" Party]] nominee. A fourth candidate, [[Eugene V. Debs]] of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], would also win a significant share of the popular vote. Roosevelt had broken with his former party at the [[1912 Republican National Convention]] after Taft narrowly won re-nomination, and the split in the Republican Party made Democrats hopeful that they could win the presidency for the first time since the [[1892 United States presidential election|1892 presidential election]].<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 154\u2013155</ref> Roosevelt emerged as Wilson's main challenger, and Wilson and Roosevelt largely campaigned against each other despite sharing similarly progressive platforms that called for a strong, interventionist central government.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 166\u2013167, 174\u2013175</ref> Wilson won 435 of the 531 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] and 41.8% of the popular vote, while Roosevelt won most of the remaining electoral votes and 27.4% of the popular vote, representing one of the [[List of third party performances in United States elections|strongest third party performances]] in U.S. history. Taft won 23.2% of the popular vote but just 8 electoral votes, while Debs won 6% of the popular vote. In the concurrent [[United States elections, 1912|congressional elections]], Democrats retained control of the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and won a majority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Wilson's victory made him the first Southerner to win the presidency since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 173\u2013174</ref>\n\n==Personnel and appointments==\n===Cabinet and administration===\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align= right\n|Name= Wilson\n|President = Woodrow Wilson\n|President start = 1913\n|President end = 1921\n|Vice President = [[Thomas R.

Relations were generally smooth, but he ended weekly meetings with the White House correspondents after the Lusitania sinking in 1915. He also sharply restricted access during the 1919 peace conference. In both cases, Wilson was afraid that publicity would interfere with his quiet diplomacy. Journalists such as [[Walter Lippmann]] found a workaround, discovering that Colonel House was both highly talkative and devious in manipulating the press to slant its stories. A major problem facing the administration was that 90 percent of the major newspapers and magazine outside the South had traditionally favored Republicans. The administration countered this by quietly collaborating with favorable reporters who admired Wilson's leadership in the cause of world peace; their newspapers printed their reports because their scoops made news. The German language press was vehemently hostile to Wilson, but he used this to his advantage, attacking hyphenates as loyal to a foreign country.<ref>James D.

Ultimately, Wilson was able to convince Senate Democrats to vote for Brandeis, and Brandeis would serve until 1939.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 330\u2013332</ref> Another vacancy arose in 1916 after the resignation of [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and Wilson appointed [[John Hessin Clarke]], a progressive lawyer from the electorally-important state of Ohio, to replace Hughes. Clarke would resign from the court in 1922.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 340, 586</ref>\n\nIn addition to his three Supreme Court appointments, Wilson also appointed 20 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]] and 52 judges to the [[United States district courts]].\n\n==Domestic policy==\n===New Freedom===\n[[File:Congress opening message 63rd 02406a.tif|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Wilson giving his first [[State of the Union]] address, the first such address since 1801<ref>{{cite journal| title=Presidential addresses to congress: Woodrow Wilson and the Jeffersonian tradition| last=Hendrix| first=J.

After weeks of hearings and debate, Wilson and Secretary of State Bryan managed to unite Senate Democrats behind the bill.<ref name=cooper216218/> The Senate voted 44 to 37 in favor of the bill, with only one Democrat voting against it and only one Republican, progressive leader [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.]], voting for it. Wilson signed the [[Revenue Act of 1913]] (also known as the Underwood Tariff) into law on October 3, 1913.<ref name=cooper216218>Cooper 2009, pp. 216\u2013218</ref>\n\nThe Revenue Act of 1913 reduced the average import tariff rates from approximately 40 percent to approximately 26 percent.<ref>Clements 1992, p. 39</ref> It also restored a federal income tax for the first time since 1872 (the federal government had also adopted an income tax in the 1890s, but that tax had been struck down by the Supreme Court before taking effect). The Revenue Act of 1913 imposed a one percent tax on incomes above $3,000, with a top tax rate of six percent on those earning more than $500,000 per year. Approximately three percent of the population was subject to the income tax. The bill also included a one percent tax on the net income of all corporations, superseding a previous federal tax that had only applied to corporate net incomes above $5,000.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp. 230\u2013232, 278\u2013282</ref> The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the income tax in the cases of ''[[Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co.]]'' and ''[[Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co.]]''<ref>Weisman 2002, p. 283</ref>\n\nFacing the need for further revenue due to an arms build-up, in 1916 the Wilson administration called for the passage of another major revenue bill. PresidentWilson and congressional allies like Congressman [[Claude Kitchin]] rejected proposal to increase tariff rates, instead favoring increased taxes on high earners.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp. 302\u2013305</ref> Working with progressive Republicans, Congressional Democrats won passage of the [[Revenue Act of 1916]], which reinstated the federal [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]], established a tax on the production of munitions, raised the top income tax rate to fifteen percent, and raised the corporate income tax from one percent to two percent.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp. 306\u2013308</ref> That same year, the President signed a law that established the [[United States International Trade Commission|Tariff Commission]], which was charged with providing expert advice on tariff rates.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 214\u2013215</ref> In the 1920s, Republicans raised tariffs and lowered the income tax. Nonetheless, the policies of the Wilson administration had a durable impact on the composition of government revenue, which after the 1920s would primarily come from taxation rather than tariffs.<ref>Gould 2003, pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\n====Federal Reserve System====\n[[File:Federal Reserve Districts Map - Banks & Branches.png|right|thumb|Map of Federal Reserve Districts\u2013black circles, Federal Reserve Banks\u2013black squares, District branches\u2013red circles and Washington HQ\u2013star/black circle]]\n\nPresident Wilson did not wait to complete the Revenue Act of 1913 before proceeding to the next item on his agenda\u2014banking. By the time Wilson took office, countries like Britain and Germany had established government-run [[central bank]]s, but the United States had not had a central bank since the [[Bank War]] of the 1830s.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 219\u2013220</ref> In the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1907]], there was general agreement among leaders in both parties of the necessity to create some sort of central banking system to provide coordination during financial emergencies. Most leaders also sought currency reform, as they believed that the roughly $3.8 billion in coins and [[banknote]]s did not provide an adequate money supply during financial panics. Under conservative Republican Senator [[Nelson Aldrich]]'s leadership, the [[National Monetary Commission]] had put forward a plan to establish a central banking system that would issue currency and provide oversight and loans to the nation's banks. However, many progressives distrusted the plan due to the degree of influence bankers would have over the central banking system. Relying heavily on the advice of Louis Brandeis, Wilson sought a middle ground between progressives such as Bryan and conservative Republicans like Aldrich.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 40\u201342</ref> He declared that the banking system must be \"public not private, [and] must be vested in the government itself so that the banks must be the instruments, not the masters, of business.\"<ref>Heckscher 1991, pp. 316-17.</ref>\n\nDemocratic Congressmen Carter Glass and [[Robert L. Owen]] crafted a compromise plan in which private banks would control twelve regional [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s, but a controlling interest in the system was placed in a central board filled with presidential appointees. The system of twelve regional banks was designed with the goal of diminishing [[Wall Street]]'s influence. Wilson convinced Bryan's supporters that the plan met their demands for an elastic currency because Federal Reserve notes would be obligations of the government.<ref>Link 1954, pp. 43\u201353</ref> The bill passed the House in September 1913, but it faced stronger opposition in the Senate. After PresidentWilson convinced just enough Democrats to defeat an amendment put forth by bank president [[Frank A.

Roosevelt and Taft had both escalated antitrust prosecution by the Justice Department, but many progressives desired legislation that would do more to prevent trusts from dominating the economy. While Roosevelt believed that trusts could be separated into \"good trusts\" and \"bad trusts\" based on their effects on the broader economy, Wilson had argued for breaking up all trusts during his 1912 presidential campaign. In December 1913, Wilson asked Congress to pass an anti-trust law that would ban many anti-competitive practices. A month later, in January 1914, he also asked for the creation of an interstate trade commission, eventually known as the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), that would preside over the dissolution of trusts but would play no role in anti-trust prosecution itself.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nWith Wilson's support, Congressman [[Henry De Lamar Clayton Jr.|Henry Clayton, Jr.]] introduced a bill that would ban several anti-competitive practices such [[Price discrimination|discriminatory pricing]], [[Tying (commerce)|tying]], [[exclusive dealing]], and [[interlocking directorate]]s. The bill also allowed individuals to launch anti-trust suits, and it limited the applicability of anti-trust laws on [[trade union|unions]].<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 48\u201349</ref> As the difficulty of banning all anti-competitive practices via legislation became clear, President Wilson came to favor legislation granting the FTC greater discretion to investigate anti-trust violations and enforce anti-trust laws independently of the Justice Department. The [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914]], which incorporated Wilson's ideas regarding the FTC, passed Congress with bipartisan support, and Wilson signed the bill into law in September 1914.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 49\u201350</ref> One month later, Wilson signed the [[Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914]], which built on the Sherman Act by defining and banning several anti-competitive practices.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\n====Labor issues====\n{{see also|Labor history of the United States}}\n \nPresident Taft had established the [[Commission on Industrial Relations]] to study labor issues, but the Senate had rejected all of his nominees to the commission. Upon taking office, Wilson nominated a mix of conservatives and progressive reformers, with commission chairman [[Frank P. Walsh]] falling into the latter group. The commission helped expose numerous labor abuses throughout the nation, and Walsh proposed reforms designed to empower unions.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 75\u201376</ref> Prior to his first presidential inauguration, Wilson had had an uneasy relationship with union leaders such as [[Samuel Gompers]] of the [[American Federation of Labor]], and he generally believed that workers were best protected through laws rather than unions.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 74\u201375</ref> Wilson and Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson]] rejected Walsh's proposed reforms, and instead focused on using the Labor Department to mediate conflicts between labor and ownership.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 76\u201378</ref> The labor policies of Wilson's administration were tested by a strike against the [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|Colorado Fuel and Iron Company]] in late-1913 and early-1914. The company rejected the Labor Department's attempts to mediate, and a militia controlled by the company attacked a miner's camp in what became known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]]. At the Governor of Colorado's request, the Wilson administration sent in troops to end the dispute, but mediation efforts failed after the union called off the strike due to a lack of funds.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 79\u201380</ref>\n\nIn mid-1916, a major railroad strike endangered the nation's economy. The president called the parties to a White House summit in August \u2014 after two days and no results, Wilson proceeded to settle the issue, using the maximum eight-hour work day as its linchpin. Congress passed the [[Adamson Act]], which incorporating the president's proposed eight-hour work day. As a result, the strike was then cancelled. Wilson was praised for averting a national economic disaster, even though the law was received with howls from conservatives, who denounced it as a sellout to the unions and a surrender by Congress to an imperious president.<ref>Heckscher 1991, p. 409.</ref> The Adamson Act was the first federal law that regulated hours worked by private employees.<ref>Cooper 1990, p. 215</ref> In 1916, Wilson signed the [[Keating\u2013Owen Act]], which banned [[child labor in the United States|child labor]]. The act was struck down by the Supreme Court in the 1918 case of ''[[Hammer v. Dagenhart]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n====Agricultural issues====\n\nPresident Wilson's agricultural policies were heavily influenced by [[Walter Hines Page]], who favored a reorganization of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to put less focus on scientific research and more emphasis on using the department to provide education and other services directly to farmers.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 54\u201356</ref> Secretary of Agriculture [[David F. Houston]] presided over the implementation of many of Page's proposed reforms and worked with Congressman [[Asbury Francis Lever]] to introduce the bill that became the [[Smith\u2013Lever Act of 1914]]. This act established government subsidies for a demonstration farming program allowing farmers to voluntarily experiment with farming techniques favored by agricultural experts. Proponents of the Smith\u2013Lever Act overcame many conservatives' objections by adding provisions to bolster local control of the program. Local agricultural colleges supervised the [[agricultural extension]] agents, and the agents were barred from operating without county governments' approval. By 1924, three-quarters of the agriculture-oriented counties in the United States took part in the agricultural extension program.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 56\u201359</ref> Wilson also helped ensure passage of the [[Federal Farm Loan Act]], which created twelve regional banks empowered to provide low-interest loans to farmers.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\n====The Philippines and Puerto Rico====\n\nWilson embraced the long-standing Democratic policy against owning colonies, and he worked for the gradual autonomy and ultimate independence of the [[Philippines]], which had been acquired from [[Spain]] in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Wilson increased self-governance on the islands by granting [[Filipinos]] greater control over the Philippine Legislature. The House passed a measure to grant the Philippines full independence, but Republicans blocked this proposal in the Senate. The [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Act]] of 1916 committed the United States to the eventual independence of the Philippines; independence took place in 1946.<ref>Cooper 2009, p. 249</ref> The [[Jones\u2013Shafroth Act|Jones Act of 1917]] upgraded the status of [[Puerto Rico]], which had also been acquired from Spain in 1898. The act, which superseded the [[Foraker Act]], created the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]], established a bill of rights, and authorized the election of a [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico|Resident Commissioner]] (previously appointed by the president) to a four-year term. The act also granted Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship and exempted [[List of bonds issued by Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican bonds]] from federal, state, and local taxes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Truman R.

Kennedy, ''A Companion to Woodrow Wilson '' (2013) pp 152-72.</ref> Wilson's progressivism encouraged his belief that immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, though poor and illiterate, could assimilate into a homogeneous white middle class, and he opposed the restrictive [[immigration to the United States|immigration policies]] that many members of both parties favored. However, the so-called \"hyphenated\" Irish and German elements repulsed him because he believed that they were motivated to help the wartime needs of [[Ireland]] and Germany, not to the needs and values of the United States.<ref>Hans Vought, \"Division and reunion: Woodrow Wilson, immigration, and the myth of American unity.\" ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' (1994) 13#3: 24-50.

The Japanese government protested strongly, and Wilson sent Secretary of State Bryan to California. Bryan was unable to get California to relax the restrictions, and Wilson accepted the law even though it violated a 1911 treaty with Japan. The law bred resentment in Japan which would linger into the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>Herbert P.

Hand chipping with pneumati - NARA - 530774.tif|thumb|Women workers in ordnance shops, Pennsylvania, 1918]]\n\nWith the American entrance into World War I in April 1917, Wilson became a war-time president. The [[War Industries Board]], headed by [[Bernard Baruch]], was established to set U.S. war manufacturing policies and goals. Future President [[Herbert Hoover]] led the [[United States Food Administration|Food Administration]]; the [[Federal Fuel Administration]], run by Henry Garfield, introduced [[daylight saving time]] and rationed fuel supplies; William McAdoo was in charge of war bond efforts; Vance McCormick headed the War Trade Board. These men, known collectively as the \"war cabinet\", met weekly with Wilson at the White House.<ref>Heckscher 1991, p. 469.</ref> Because he was heavily focused on foreign policy during World War I, Wilson delegated a large degree of authority over the home front to his subordinates.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 296\u2013297</ref>\n\nThe great majority of unions, including the AFL and the railroad brotherhoods, supported the war effort, and were rewarded for their efforts with high pay and access to Wilson.

Wilson's labor policies continued to stress mediation and agreement on all sides. When [[Smith & Wesson]] refused to assent to an NWLB ruling, the War Department seized control of the gun company and forced employees to return to work.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 84\u201385</ref>\n\n====Financing the war====\n\nIn the midst of the war, the federal budget soared from $1 billion in [[fiscal year]] 1916 to $19 billion in fiscal year 1919.<ref name=\"clements156157\"/> In addition to spending on its own military build-up, the United States provided large loans to the Allied countries, helping to prevent the economic collapse of Britain and France. By the end of the war, the United States had become a creditor nation for the first time in its history.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 276, 319</ref> Seeking to avoid the high levels of inflation that had accompanied the heavy borrowing of the [[American Civil War]], the Wilson administration sought to further increase taxes during the war.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp 320</ref> The [[War Revenue Act of 1917]] raised the top tax rate to 67 percent, greatly increased the number of Americans paying the income tax (approximately 5.5 million Americans would pay the income tax in 1920), and levied an [[excess profits tax]] on businesses and individuals.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp. 325\u2013329, 345</ref> The [[Revenue Act of 1918]] raised the top tax rate to 77 percent and further increased other taxes.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp. 337\u2013338</ref>\n\nDespite these tax acts, the United States was forced to borrow heavily to finance the war effort. Treasury Secretary McAdoo authorized the issuing of low-interest war bonds and, to attract investors, made interest on the bonds tax-free. The bonds proved so popular among investors that many borrowed money in order to buy more bonds. The purchase of bonds, along with other war-time pressures, resulted in rising [[inflation]]. However, this inflation was partly matched by rising wages and profits, as farmers, laborers, and business owners benefited from the stimulative effect of government spending.<ref name=\"clements156157\">Clements 1992, pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\n====Propaganda====\n[[File:U.S. Official War Pictures, by Louis Fancher.jpg|thumb|right|\"U.S. Official War Pictures\", CPI poster by [[Louis D.

He set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of posters, pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the [[Four Minute Men]]. The CPI also worked with the Post Office to censor seditious counter-propaganda.<ref>Katherine H. Adams, ''Progressive Politics and the Training of America's Persuaders'' (1999)</ref> The CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during the four-minute breaks needed to change reels at movie theaters. CPI volunteers also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and even logging camps.  Creel boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people.<ref>Lisa Mastrangelo,  \"World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation.\" ''Rhetoric & Public Affairs'' 12#4 (2009): 607-633.</ref>\n\n====Disloyalty====\nTo counter disloyalty to the war effort at home, Wilson pushed through Congress the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] to suppress anti-British, pro-German, or anti-war statements.<ref>Cooper 2008, p. 190</ref> While he welcomed socialists who supported the war, he pushed at the same time to arrest and deport foreign-born enemies.<ref name=\"AVR\">Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-02604-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-691-02604-6}} (1991), pp. 93\u201394, 124, 127, 130\u2013133</ref> Many recent immigrants, [[resident aliens]] without U.S. citizenship, who opposed America's participation in the war were deported to Soviet Russia or other nations under the powers granted in the [[Immigration Act of 1918]].<ref name=\"AVR\"/><ref name=\"COOP2\"/> Because of the lack of a national police force, the Wilson administration relied heavily on state and local police forces, as well as voluntary compliance, to enforce war-time laws.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 287\u2013288</ref> Anarchists, [[Communist Party USA|communists]], [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members, and other antiwar groups attempting to sabotage the war effort were targeted by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]; many of their leaders were arrested for incitement to violence, espionage, or [[sedition]].<ref name=\"AVR\"/><ref name=\"COOP2\">Cooper 2008, pp. 201, 209</ref> Eugene Debs, the 1912 Socialist presidential candidate, was among the most prominent individuals jailed for sedition.

They instead advocated world involvement along liberal-internationalist lines.

Herring says that Wilson's idealism was genuine, but that it was structured by blind spots:\n:Wilson's genuine and deeply felt aspirations to build a better world suffered from a certain culture-blindness. He lacked experience in diplomacy and hence an appreciation of its limits. He had not traveled widely outside the United States and knew little of other peoples and cultures beyond Britain, which he greatly admired. Especially in his first years in office, he had difficulty seeing that well-intended efforts to spread U.S. values might be viewed as interference at best, coercion at worst. His vision was further narrowed by the terrible burden of racism, common among the elite of his generation, which limited his capacity to understand and respect people of different colors. Above all, he was blinded by his certainty of America's goodness and destiny.<ref>Herring 2008, p. 381</ref>\n\n===Latin America===\n{{see also|Banana Wars}}\n\nWilson sought closer relations with [[Latin America]], and he hoped to create a [[Pan-Americanism|Pan-American]] organization to arbitrate international disputes. He also negotiated a treaty with Colombia that would have paid that country an indemnity for the U.S. role in the [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|secession]] of [[Panama]], but the Senate defeated this treaty.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 245\u2013247</ref> However, Wilson frequently intervened in Latin American affairs, saying in 1913: \"I am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men.\"<ref>Paul Horgan, ''Great River: the Rio Grande in North American History'' (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1984), 913</ref> The [[Dominican Republic]] had been a de facto American [[protectorate]] since Roosevelt's presidency, but suffered from instability. In 1916, Wilson [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916\u201324)|sent troops to occupy]] the island, and the U.S. soldiers would remain until 1924. In 1915, the U.S. [[United States occupation of Haiti|intervened]] in [[Haiti]] after a revolt overthrew the Haitian government, beginning an occupation that would last until 1919. Wilson also authorized military interventions in [[Cuba]], [[Panama]], and [[Honduras]]. The 1914 [[Bryan\u2013Chamorro Treaty]] converted [[Nicaragua]] into another de facto protectorate, and the U.S. [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|stationed soldiers]] there throughout Wilson's presidency.<ref>Herring 2008, pp. 388-390</ref>\n\nThe [[Panama Canal]] opened in 1914, fulfilling the long-term American goal of building a canal across Central America. The canal provided quick passage between the [[Pacific Ocean]] with the [[Atlantic Ocean]], presenting new opportunities to the shippers and allowing the Navy to quickly transfer warships between the two oceans. In 1916, Wilson used the [[Treaty of the Danish West Indies]] to purchase the [[Danish West Indies]] for $25 million. The new territory was renamed as the [[United States Virgin Islands]].<ref>See [http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/jazz/jb_jazz_virgin_1.html \"U.S. Took Ownership of the Virgin Islands March 31, 1917\" (Library of Congress)]</ref>\n\n====Mexican Revolution====\n{{Main|United States involvement in the Mexican Revolution}}\n\nWilson took office during the [[Mexican Revolution]], which had begun in 1911 after liberals overthrew the military dictatorship of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]. Shortly before Wilson took office, conservatives retook power through a coup led by [[Victoriano Huerta]].<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 96\u201397</ref> Wilson rejected the legitimacy of Huerta's \"government of butchers\" and demanded Mexico hold democratic elections. Wilson's unprecedented approach meant no recognition and doomed Huerta's prospects for establishing a stable government.<ref>Peter V. N. Henderson, \"Woodrow Wilson, Victoriano Huerta, and the Recognition Issue in Mexico\", ''The Americas'' (1984) 41#2 pp. 151-176 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1007454 in JSTOR]</ref> After Huerta arrested U.S. Navy personnel who had accidentally landed in a restricted zone near the northern port town of [[Tampico]], Wilson [[United States occupation of Veracruz|dispatched the Navy to occupy]] the Mexican city of [[Veracruz]]. A strong backlash against the American intervention among Mexicans of all political affiliations convinced Wilson to abandon his plans to expand the U.S. military intervention, but the intervention nonetheless helped convince Huerta to flee from the country.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 98\u201399</ref> A group led by [[Venustiano Carranza]] established control over a significant proportion of Mexico, and Wilson recognized Carranza's government in October 1915.<ref name=\"Clements 1992, pp. 99\u2013100\">Clements 1992, pp. 99\u2013100</ref>\n\nCarranza continued to face various opponents within Mexico, including [[Pancho Villa]], whom Wilson had earlier described as \"a sort of [[Robin Hood]].\"<ref name=\"Clements 1992, pp. 99\u2013100\"/> In early 1916, Pancho Villa raided an American town in New Mexico, killing or wounding dozens of Americans and causing an enormous nationwide American demand for his punishment. Wilson ordered General [[John J. Pershing]] and 4000 troops across the border to capture Villa. By April, Pershing's forces had broken up and dispersed Villas bands, but Villa remained on the loose and Pershing continued his pursuit deep into Mexico. Carranza then pivoted against the Americans and accused them of a punitive invasion; a confrontation with a mob in Parral on April 12 resulted in two dead Americans and six wounded, plus hundreds of Mexican casualties. Further incidents led to the brink of war by late June, when Wilson demanded an immediate release of American soldiers held prisoner. The prisoners were released, tensions subsided, and bilateral negotiations began under the auspices of the Mexican-American Joint High Commission. Eager to withdraw from Mexico due to World War I, Wilson ordered Pershing to withdraw, and the last American soldiers left in February 1917. According to historian Arthur Link, Carranza's successful handling of the American intervention in Mexico left the country free to develop its revolution without American pressure.<ref>Link 1964, 194\u2013221, 280\u2013318; Link 1965, 51\u201354, 328\u2013339</ref> The incident also gave the American army some needed experience and made Pershing a national figure.<ref>Richard C.

The war fell into a long stalemate after the German advance was halted in September 1914 at the [[First Battle of the Marne]].<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 116\u2013117</ref> From 1914 until early 1917, Wilson's primary foreign policy objective was to keep the United States out of the war in Europe.<ref>Heckscher 1991, p. 339.</ref> Wilson insisted that all government actions be neutral, and that the belligerents must respect that neutrality according to the norms of international law. After the war began, Wilson told the Senate that the United States, \"must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before another.\" He was ambiguous whether he meant the United States as a nation or meant all Americans as individuals.<ref>Link 1960, 66</ref> Though Wilson was determined to keep the United States out of the war, and he thought that the [[Causes of World War I|causes of the war]] were complex, he personally believed that the U.S. shared more values with the Allies than the Central Powers.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\n[[File:The American War-Dog by Oscar Cesare 1916.jpg|thumb|Wilson and \"Jingo\", the American War Dog.

The policy hurt the Allies more than the Central Powers, since the Allies were more dependent on American goods. The administration relaxed the policy of discouraging loans in October 1914 and then ended it in October 1915 due to fears about the policy's effect on the American economy.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 117\u2013118</ref> The United States sought to trade with both the Allied Powers and the Central Powers, but the British attempted to impose a [[Blockade of Germany]], and, after a period of negotiations, Wilson essentially assented to the British blockade. The U.S. had relatively little direct trade with the Central Powers, and Wilson was unwilling to wage war against Britain over trade issues.<ref name=clements119123/> The British also made their blockade more acceptable to American leaders by buying, rather than seizing without compensation, intercepted goods.<ref name=\"Clements 1992, pp. 128\u2013129\">Clements 1992, pp. 128\u2013129</ref> Many Germans viewed American trade with the Allies as decidedly unneutral.<ref name=clements119123>Clements 1992, pp. 119\u2013123</ref>\n\n====Growing tensions====\n{{Further|U-boat Campaign (World War I)}}\n\nIn response to the British blockade of the Central Powers, the Germans launched a [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|submarine campaign]] against merchant vessels in the seas surrounding the British Isles.

Wilson believed that a massive military mobilization could only take place after a declaration of war, even though that meant a long delay in sending troops to Europe. Many Democrats felt that no American soldiers would be needed, only American money and munitions.<ref>David Esposito, David. \"Political and Institutional Constraints on Wilson's Defense Policy.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 26.4 (1996): 1114-1125.</ref>  Wilson had more success in his request for a dramatic expansion of the Navy.

We shall not believe they are hostile to us unless or until we are obliged to believe it\".<ref>Heckscher 1991, pp. 428\u2013429</ref> After a series of attacks on American ships, Wilson held a Cabinet meeting on March 20; all Cabinet members agreed that the time had come for the United States to enter the war. Wilson called Congress into a special session, which would begin on April 2.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 139\u2013140</ref>\n\nMarch 1917 also brought the first of two revolutions in Russia, which impacted the strategic role of the U.S. in the war. The overthrow of the imperial government removed a serious barrier to America's entry into the European conflict, while the second revolution in November relieved the Germans of a major threat on their eastern front, and allowed them to dedicate more troops to the Western front, thus making U.S. forces central to Allied success in battles of 1918. Wilson initially rebuffed pleas from the Allies to dedicate military resources to an intervention in Russia against the [[Bolshevik]]s, based partially on his experience from attempted intervention in Mexico; nevertheless he ultimately was convinced of the potential benefit and agreed to dispatch a limited force to assist the Allies on the eastern front.<ref>Georg Schild, review of Carl J.

House also became the U.S. representative on the Allies' Supreme War Council.<ref>Heckscher 1991, pp. 460\u2013462.</ref>\n\n====The Fourteen Points====\n{{Main|Fourteen Points}}\n\nWilson sought the establishment of \"an organized common peace\" that would help prevent future conflicts. In this goal, he was opposed not just by the Central Powers, but also the other Allied Powers, who, to various degrees, sought to win concessions and oppose a punitive peace agreement on the Central Powers.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 164\u2013165</ref> He initiated a secret study group named [[The Inquiry]], directed by Colonel House, to prepare for post-ware negotiations.<ref>Heckscher 1991, p. 470.</ref> The Inquiry's studies culminated in a speech by Wilson to Congress on January 8, 1918, wherein he articulated America's long term war objectives. It was the clearest expression of intention made by any of the belligerent nations. The speech, known as the Fourteen Points, was authored mainly by [[Walter Lippmann]] and projected Wilson's progressive domestic policies into the international arena. The first six points dealt with diplomacy, freedom of the seas, and settlement of colonial claims. Then territorial issues were addressed and the final point, the establishment of an association of nations to guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of all nations\u2014a [[League of Nations]]. The address was translated into many languages for global dissemination.<ref>Heckscher 1991, p. 471.</ref>\n\nAside from post-war considerations, Wilson's Fourteen Points were motivated by several factors. Unlike some of the other Allied leaders, Wilson did not call for the total break-up of the Ottoman Empire or the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In offering a non-punitive peace to these nations as well as Germany, Wilson hoped to quickly began negotiations to end the war. Wilson's liberal pronouncements were also targeted at pacifistic and war-weary elements within the Allied countries, including the United States. Additionally, Wilson hoped to woo the Russians back into the war, although he failed in this goal.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 423\u2013424</ref>\n\n====Course of the war====\n\nWith the U.S. entrance into the war, Wilson and Secretary of War Baker launched an expansion of the army, with the goal of creating a 300,000-member [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]], a 440,000-member [[Army National Guard|National Guard]], and a 500,000-member conscripted force known as the \"[[Army of the United States|National Army]].\" Despite some resistance to conscription and to the commitment of American soldiers abroad, large majorities of both houses of Congress voted to impose conscription with the [[Selective Service Act of 1917]]. Seeking to avoid the draft riots of the Civil War, the bill established local draft boards that were charged with determining who should be drafted. By the end of the war, nearly 3 million men would be drafted.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 143\u2013146</ref> The Navy also saw tremendous expansion, and, at the urging of Admiral [[William Sims]], focused on building anti-submarine vessels. Allied shipping losses dropped substantially due to U.S. contributions and a new emphasis on the [[Convoys in World War I|convoy system]].<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 147\u2013149</ref>\n\nThe [[American Expeditionary Forces]] first arrived in France in mid-1917.<ref>Clements 1992, p. 144</ref> Wilson and Pershing rejected the British and French proposal that American soldiers integrate into existing Allied units, giving the United States more freedom of action but requiring for the creation of new organizations and supply chains.<ref>Clements 1992, p. 150</ref> There were only 175,000 American soldiers in Europe at the end of 1917, but by mid-1918 10,000 Americans were arriving in Europe per day. Russia exited the war after the March 1918 signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], allowing Germany to shift soldiers from the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] of the war. The Germans launched a [[Spring Offensive]] against the Allies that inflicted heavy casualties but failed to break the Allied line. Beginning in August, the Allies launched the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] that pushed back the exhausted German army.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 149\u2013151</ref>\n\nBy the end of September 1918, the German leadership no longer believed it could win the war. Recognizing that Wilson would be more likely to accept a peace deal from a democratic government, Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] appointed a new government led by [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]]; Baden immediately sought an armistice with Wilson.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> In the exchange of notes, German and American leaders agreed to incorporate the Fourteen Points in the armistice; House then procured agreement from France and Britain, but only after threatening to conclude a unilateral armistice without them. Wilson ignored Pershing's plea to drop the armistice and instead demand an unconditional surrender by Germany.<ref>Heckscher 1991, pp. 479\u201388.</ref> The Germans signed the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], bringing an end to the fighting. Austria-Hungary had signed the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] eight days earlier, while the Ottoman Empire had signed the [[Armistice of Mudros]] in October.\n\n===Aftermath of World War I===\n====Paris Peace Conference====\n{{Main|Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Aftermath of World War I}}\n[[File:Big four.jpg|thumb|The \"Big Four\" at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, following the end of World War I. Wilson is standing next to [[Georges Clemenceau]] at right.]]\n\nAfter the signing of the armistice, Wilson traveled to Europe to attend the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], thereby becoming the first U.S. president to travel to Europe while in office.<ref>Heckscher 1991, p. 458.</ref> Save for a two-week return to the United States, Wilson remained in Europe for six months, where he focused on reaching a peace treaty to formally end the war. The defeated Central Powers had not been invited to the conference, and anxiously awaited their fate.<ref name=\"herring417420\"/> Wilson proposed that the competing factions of the [[Russian Civil War]] declare a truce and send a joint delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, but other Allied leaders opposed the proposal and no delegation was sent.<ref>Berg (2013), pp. 532\u2013533</ref> Wilson, British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]], and Italian Prime Minister [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] made up the \"[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]],\" the Allied leaders with the most influence at the Paris Peace Conference. Though Wilson continued to advocate his idealistic Fourteen Points, many of the other allies desired revenge. Clemenceau especially sought onerous terms for Germany, while Lloyd George supported some of Wilson's ideas but feared public backlash if the treaty proved too favorable to the Central Powers.<ref name=\"herring417420\">Herring 2008, pp. 417-420</ref>\n\n[[File:Map Europe 1923-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Several new European states were established at the Paris Peace Conference]]\n\nIn pursuit of his League of Nations, Wilson conceded several points to the other powers present at the conference. France pressed for the dismemberment of Germany and the payment of a huge sum in [[war reparation]]s. Wilson resisted these ideas, but Germany was still required to pay war reparations and subjected to [[Allied occupation of the Rhineland|military occupation in the Rhineland]]. Additionally, a [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|clause]] in the treaty specifically named Germany as responsible for the war. Wilson agreed to the creation of [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]] in former German and Ottoman territories, allowing the European powers and Japan to establish de facto colonies in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The Japanese acquisition of German interests in the [[Shandong Peninsula]] of China proved especially [[Shandong Problem|unpopular]], as it undercut Wilson's promise of self-government. However, Wilson won the creation of several new states in Central Europe and the Balkans, including Poland, [[Yugoslavia]], and [[Czechoslovakia]], and the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire were partitioned.<ref>Herring 2008, pp. 421-423</ref> Wilson refused to concede to Italy's demands for territory on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]], leading to a dispute between Yugoslavia and Italy that would not be settled until the signing of the 1920 [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]].<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 182\u2013183</ref> Japan proposed that the conference endorse a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|racial equality clause]]. Wilson was indifferent to the issue, but acceded to strong opposition from Australia and Britain.<ref>{{cite book |author=Naoko Shimazu |title=Japan, Race, and Equality: The Racial Equality Proposal of 1919 |location=NY |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |pages=154ff |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YwHbgnSi_sQC&pg=PA154|isbn=9780415497350 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was incorporated into the conference's [[Treaty of Versailles]], which ended the war with Germany.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 180\u2013185</ref> Wilson himself presided over the committee that drafted the covenant, which bound members to oppose \"external aggression\" and to agree to peacefully settle disputes through organizations like the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 177\u2013178</ref> During the conference, former President Taft cabled to Wilson three proposed amendments to the League covenant which he thought would considerably increase its acceptability\u2014the right of withdrawal from the League, the exemption of domestic issues from the League, and the inviolability of the Monroe Doctrine. Wilson very reluctantly accepted these amendments. In addition to the Treaty of Versailles, the Allies also wrote treaties with Austria (the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]), Hungary (the [[Treaty of Trianon]]), the Ottoman Empire (the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]), and Bulgaria (the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]]), all of which incorporated the League of Nations charter.<ref>Heckscher 1991, pp. 551\u2013553.</ref>\n\nThe conference finished negotiations in May 1919, at which point German leaders viewed the treaty for the first time. Some German leaders favored repudiating the treaty, but Germany signed the treaty on June 28, 1919.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 185\u2013186</ref> For his peace-making efforts, Wilson was awarded the 1919 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref name=\"nobelprize1919\">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1919/index.html|title=Woodrow Wilson bio sketch|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014}}</ref> However, the defeated Central Powers protested the harsh terms of the treaty, and several colonial representatives pointed out the hypocrisy of a treaty that established new nations in Europe but allowed continued colonialism in Asia and Africa. Wilson also faced an uncertain domestic battle to ratify the treaty, as Republicans largely opposed it.<ref>Herring 2008, pp. 426-427</ref>\n\n====Treaty ratification debate====\n[[File:WoodrowWilsonVersailles.jpg|upright|thumb|Wilson returning from the Versailles Peace Conference, 1919.]]\n\nThe chances were less than favorable for ratification of the treaty by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, in which Republicans held a narrow majority.<ref name=\"Clements 1992, pp. 190\u2013191\">Clements 1992, pp. 190\u2013191</ref> Public opinion on the treaty was mixed, with intense opposition from most Republicans, Germans, and Irish Catholic Democrats. In numerous meetings with Senators, Wilson discovered opposition had hardened. Despite his weakened physical condition following the Paris Peace Conference, Wilson decided to barnstorm the Western states, scheduling 29 major speeches and many short ones to rally support.<ref>Berg 2013, pp. 619\u201334</ref> Wilson suffered a series of debilitating strokes and had to cut short his trip on in September 1919. He became an invalid in the White House, closely monitored by his wife, who insulated him from negative news and downplayed for him the gravity of his condition.<ref>Berg 2013, pp. 635\u201343</ref>\n\nSenator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] led the opposition to the treaty; he despised Wilson and hoped to humiliate him in the ratification battle. Republicans were outraged by Wilson's failure to discuss the war or its aftermath with them. An intensely partisan battle developed in the Senate, as Republicans opposed the treaty and Democrats largely supported it. The debate over the treaty centered around a debate over the American role in the world community in the post-war era, and Senators fell into three main groups. Most Democrats favored the treaty.<ref name=\"Clements 1992, pp. 190\u2013191\"/> Fourteen Senators, mostly Republicans, become known as the \"[[irreconcilables]],\" as they completely opposed U.S. entrance into the League of Nations. Some of these irreconcilables, such as [[George W. Norris]], opposed the treaty for its failure to support decolonization and disarmament. Other irreconcilables, such as [[Hiram Johnson]], feared surrendering American freedom of action to an international organization. Most sought the removal of Article X the League covenant, which purported to bind nations to defend each other against aggression.<ref name=\"herring427430\">Herring 2008, pp. 427-430</ref> The remaining group of Senators, known as \"reservationists,\" accepted the idea of the league, but sought varying degrees of change to the League to ensure the protection of U.S. sovereignty.<ref name=\"herring427430\"/> Former President Taft and former Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]] both favored ratification of the treaty with some modifications, and their public support for the treaty gave Wilson some chance of winning significant Republican support for ratification.<ref name=\"Clements 1992, pp. 190\u2013191\"/>\n\nDespite the difficulty of winning ratification, Wilson consistently refused to accede to reservations, partly due to concerns about having to re-open negotiations with the other powers if reservations were added.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 191\u2013192, 200</ref> In mid-November 1919, Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-treaty Democrats to pass a treaty with reservations, but the seriously indisposed Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to defeat ratification. Cooper and Bailey suggest that Wilson's stroke in September had debilitated him from negotiating effectively with Lodge.<ref>Cooper 2009, 544, 557\u2013560; Bailey calls Wilson's rejection, \"The Supreme Infanticide,\" ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945) p. 271.</ref> U.S. involvement in World War I would not formally end until the passage of the [[Knox\u2013Porter Resolution]] in 1921.\n\n====Intervention in Russia====\n{{see also|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}\n\nAfter Russia left World War I following the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917, the Allies sent troops there to prevent a German or [[Bolshevik]] takeover of weapons, munitions and other supplies previously shipped as aid to the pre-revolutionary government.<ref>[[George F. Kennan]], ''Russia Leaves the War'', p. 472, ''et passim''. 1956, repr. 1989, {{ISBN|0-691-00841-8}}.</ref> Wilson loathed the Bolsheviks, who he believed did not represent the Russian people, but he feared that foreign intervention would only strengthen Bolshevik rule. Britain and France pressured him to intervene in order to potentially re-open a second front against Germany, and Wilson acceded to this pressure in the hope that it would help him in post-war negotiations and check Japanese influence in Siberia.<ref>Herring 2008, pp. 414-415</ref> The U.S. sent armed forces to assist the withdrawal of [[Czechoslovak Legions]] along the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], and to hold key port cities at [[Arkhangelsk]] and [[Vladivostok]]. Though specifically instructed not to engage the Bolsheviks, the U.S. forces engaged in several armed conflicts against forces of the new Russian government. Revolutionaries in Russia resented the United States intrusion. Robert Maddox wrote, \"The immediate effect of the intervention was to prolong a bloody civil war, thereby costing thousands of additional lives and wreaking enormous destruction on an already battered society.\"<ref>Robert J. Maddox, ''The Unknown War with Russia'' (San Rafael, CA: Presidio Press, 1977), 137.</ref>\n\n====Other issues====\n\nIn 1919, Wilson guided American foreign policy to \"acquiesce\" in the [[Balfour Declaration]] without supporting Zionism in an official way. Wilson expressed sympathy for the plight of Jews, especially in Poland and France.<ref>Walworth (1986) 473\u201383, esp. p. 481; Melvin I. Urofsky, ''American Zionism from Herzl to the Holocaust,'' (1995) ch. 6; Frank W. Brecher, ''Reluctant Ally: United States Foreign Policy toward the Jews from Wilson to Roosevelt.'' (1991) ch 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nIn May 1920, Wilson sent a long-deferred proposal to Congress to have the U.S. accept a [[League of Nations mandates|mandate from the League of Nations]] to take over [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]].<ref>[[Peter Balakian]] (2003). ''The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response''. New York: HarperCollins.</ref> Bailey notes this was opposed by American public opinion, and had the support of only 23 senators.<ref>Bailey, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945) pp. 295\u201396.</ref>  [[Richard G.

Many expressed qualms about Wilson's fitness for the presidency at a time when the League fight was reaching a climax, and domestic issues such as strikes, unemployment, inflation and the threat of Communism were ablaze. No one close to Wilson, including his wife, his physician, or personal assistant, was willing to take responsibility to certify, as required by the Constitution, his \"inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office\".<ref>Cooper 2009, p. 555</ref> Though some members of Congress encouraged Vice President Marshall to assert his claim to the presidency, Marshall never attempted to replace Wilson.<ref name=\"marshallsen\"/> Wilson's lengthy period of incapacity while serving as president was nearly unprecedented; of the previous presidents, only [[James Garfield]] had been in a similar situation, but Garfield retained greater control of his mental faculties and faced relatively few pressing issues.<ref>Cooper 2009, p. 535</ref>\n\n==Elections during the Wilson presidency==\n===Midterm elections of 1914===\n{{Main|United States elections, 1914}}\n\nIn Wilson's first mid-term elections, Republicans picked up sixty seats in the House, but failed to re-take the chamber.

Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party, which had won a handful of Congressional seats in the 1912 election, fared poorly, while conservative Republicans also defeated several progressive Republicans. The continuing Democratic control of Congress pleased Wilson, and he publicly argued that the election represented a mandate for continued progressive reforms.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 273\u2013274</ref> In the ensuing [[64th United States Congress|64th Congress]], Wilson and his allies passed several more laws, though none were as impactful as the major domestic initiatives that had been passed during Wilson's first two years in office.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 213\u2013214</ref>\n\n===Presidential election of 1916===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1916}}\n[[File:Woodrow Wilson, accepting Democratic nomination, 1916.JPG|thumb|Wilson accepts the Democratic Party nomination, 1916]]\n\nWilson, renominated without opposition, employed his campaign slogan \"He kept us out of war\", though he never promised unequivocally to stay out of the war.

Wilson, in turn, included in his draft platform a plank that called for all work performed by and for the federal government to provide a minimum wage, an eight-hour day and six-day workweek, health and safety measures, the prohibition of child labour, and (his own additions) safeguards for female workers and a retirement program.<ref>Cooper 2009, p. 335</ref>\n\nThe [[1916 Republican National Convention]] nominated Supreme Court Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] for president.

Wilson succeeded in defeating several intra-party opponents, including Senator [[James K.

Harding defeated Democratic nominee James Cox in the 1920 election]]\n\nDespite his ill health, Wilson continued to entertain the possibility of running for a third term. Many of Wilson's advisers tried to convince him that his health precluded another campaign, but Wilson nonetheless asked Secretary of State [[Bainbridge Colby]] to nominate him for president at the [[1920 Democratic National Convention]]. While the convention strongly endorsed Wilson's policies, Democratic leaders were unwilling to support the ailing Wilson for a third term. The convention held several ballots over multiple days, with McAdoo and Governor [[James M. Cox|James Cox]] of Ohio emerging as the major contenders for the nomination.<ref name=\"cooper565569\">Cooper 2009, pp. 565\u2013569</ref> Though McAdoo had served as Secretary of the Treasury under Wilson, and had married [[Eleanor Wilson McAdoo|Wilson's daughter]] in 1914, the president did not back McAdoo's candidacy due in part to McAdoo's perceived lukewarm support for the League of Nations.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 360\u2013361</ref> After dozens of ballots, the convention nominated a ticket consisting of Cox and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]].<ref name=\"cooper565569\"/>\n\nMany expected Theodore Roosevelt to be the 1920 Republican nominee, but his death in January 1919 left the race for the Republican nomination wide open.<ref>Cooper 2009, p. 466</ref> The three major contenders for the Republican nomination were General [[Leonard Wood]], who had been a close friend of Roosevelt, Senator Hiram Johnson, who was Roosevelt's running mate on the 1912 Progressive ticket, and Governor [[Frank Lowden]] of Illinois. When the [[1920 Republican National Convention]] met in June 1920, none of the three major contenders were able to accrue enough support to win the nomination, and party leaders put forward various [[favorite son]] candidates. The party ultimately nominated a [[dark horse]] candidate, Senator [[Warren G. Harding]] of Ohio.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 362\u2013364</ref> The Republicans centered their campaign around opposition to Wilson's policies, with Harding promising a \"[[return to normalcy]]\" to the conservative policies that had prevailed at the turn of the century. Wilson largely stayed out of the campaign, although he endorsed Cox and continued to advocate for U.S. membership in the League of Nations. Harding won a landslide victory, taking 60.3% of the popular vote and winning every state outside of the South. Democrats also suffered huge losses in the Congressional and gubernatorial [[United States elections, 1920|elections of 1920]], and the Republicans increased their majorities in both houses of Congress.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 569\u2013572</ref>\n\n==Historical reputation==\n\nWilson is generally [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|ranked by historians and political scientists]] as one of the better presidents.<ref name=\"jschuessler1\"/> A 2018 poll of the [[American Political Science Association]]'s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Wilson as the 10th best president.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rottinghaus|first1=Brandon|last2=Vaughn|first2=Justin S.|title=How Does Trump Stack Up Against the Best \u2014 and Worst \u2014 Presidents?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/19/opinion/how-does-trump-stack-up-against-the-best-and-worst-presidents.html/|accessdate=14 May 2018|newspaper=New York Times|date=19 February 2018}}</ref> A 2017 [[C-Span]] poll of historians ranked Wilson as the 11th best president.<ref>{{cite web|title=Presidential Historians Survey 2017|url=https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2017/?page=overall|website=C-Span|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> However, a 2006 poll of historians ranked Wilson's unwillingness to compromise on the Treaty of Versailles as the fourth-worst mistake made by a sitting president.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scholars rate worst presidential errors |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-02-18-presidential-goofs_x.htm |accessdate=31 August 2018 |agency=AP |newspaper=USA Today |date=18 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nMore than any of his predecessors, Wilson took steps towards the creation of a strong federal government that would protect ordinary citizens against the overwhelming power of large corporations.<ref name=\"jzimmerman1\">{{cite news|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Jonathan|title=What Woodrow Wilson Did For Black America|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/woodrow-wilson-racism-213388|accessdate=29 August 2016|publisher=Politico|date=23 November 2015}}</ref> Many of Wilson's accomplishments, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the graduated income tax, and labor laws, continued to influence the United States long after Wilson's death.<ref name=\"jschuessler1\"/> He is generally regarded as a key figure in the establishment of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|Modern American liberalism]], and a strong influence on future presidents such as [[Franklin D.

Bailey]] in two books that remain heavily cited by scholars, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Lost Peace'' (1944) and ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945), Bailey:\n:contended that Wilson's wartime isolationism, as well as his peace proposals at war's end, were seriously flawed. Highlighting the fact that American delegates encountered staunch opposition to Wilson's proposed League of Nations, Bailey concluded that the president and his diplomatic staff essentially sold out, compromising important American ideals to secure mere fragments of Wilson's progressive vision. Hence, while Bailey primarily targeted President Wilson in these critiques, others, including House, did not emerge unscathed.<ref>Scot D. Bruce, \"Woodrow Wilson's House:\nThe Hidden Hand of Wilsonian Progressivism\" '' Reviews in American History'' 45#4 (2017) pp 623-24.</ref>\n\nScot Bruce argues that:\n:More recently, prominent historians such as Thomas J. Knock, [[Arthur Walworth]], and [[John Milton Cooper]], among others, shied away from condemning Wilson and his peacemakers for extensive diplomatic failures in Paris. Instead, they framed Wilsonian progressivism, articulated through the League of Nations, as a comparatively enlightened framework tragically undermined by British and French machinations at the peace conference....Historian [[Margaret MacMillan]], continued this analytical trend in her prize-winning book, ''Paris, 1919: Six Months That Changed the World'' (2001), which characterized Wilson as the frustrated idealist, unable to secure his progressive vision due to opposition from old-guard imperialists in his midst. While realists like Lloyd E. Ambrosius questioned the merits of defining Wilsonian progressivism too idealistically, the idea has persisted that well-intentioned U.S. delegates encountered staunch opposition to Wilson's proposals in Paris, and therefore compromised under pressure. Even the great Wilson scholar, [[Arthur S. Link]], subscribed to a version of this narrative.<ref>Bruce, \"Woodrow Wilson's House:\nThe Hidden Hand of Wilsonian Progressivism\"  (2017) p. 624.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [[A.

Wilson, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who previously served as the [[governor of New Jersey]], took office as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|28th]] U.S. President after winning the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 presidential election]], gaining a large majority in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and a 42% plurality of the popular vote in a four\u2013candidate field. Wilson was re-elected in [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]], defeating [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]] by a fairly narrow margin. He was the first [[Southern United States|Southerner]] to be elected president since [[Zachary Taylor]] in [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]], and just the second Democrat to be elected president since [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]].\n\nWilson was a leading force in the [[Progressive Movement]], and during his first term, he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the [[New Deal]] in the 1930s. Taking office one month after the ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment of the Constitution]] permitted a federal income tax, he helped pass the [[Revenue Act of 1913]], which reintroduced a federal [[Income Tax in the United States|income tax]] to lower [[Tariffs in United States history|tariff rates]]. Other major progressive legislations passed during Wilson's first term include the [[Federal Reserve Act]], the [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914]], the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]], and the [[Federal Farm Loan Act]]. While the passing of the [[Adamson Act]] \u2014 which imposed an 8-hour workday for railroads - he averted a railroad strike and an ensuing economic crisis. Concerning race issues, Wilson's administration enforced [[segregation in the United States|segregationist]] policies for government agencies. Upon the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, Wilson maintained a policy of neutrality, while pursuing a [[United States involvement in the Mexican Revolution|moralistic policy]] in dealing with [[Mexican Revolution|Mexico's civil war]].\n\nWilson's second term was dominated by the [[American entry into World War I|America's entry into]] [[World War I]] and that war's [[Aftermath of World War I|aftermath]]. In April 1917, when Germany resumed [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], Wilson asked Congress to declare war in order to make \"the world safe for democracy.\" Through the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], conscription sent 10,000 freshly trained soldiers to France per day by summer 1918. On the home front, Wilson raised income taxes, set up the [[War Industries Board]], promoted [[Labor history of the United States|labor union]] cooperation, regulated agriculture and food production through the [[Food and Fuel Control Act|Lever Act]], and nationalized the nation's railroad system. In his 1915 State of the Union, Wilson asked Congress for what became the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], suppressing anti-draft activists. The crackdown [[Palmer Raids|was later intensified]] by Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] to include expulsion of non-citizen radicals during the [[First Red Scare]] of 1919\u20131920. Wilson infused morality into his internationalism, an ideology now referred to as \"[[Wilsonian]]\"\u2014an activist foreign policy calling on the nation to promote global democracy.<ref>{{cite book |first=John Morton |last=Blum |title=Woodrow Wilson and the Politics of Morality |url=https://archive.org/details/woodrowwilsonpol0000blum |url-access=registration |year=1956 |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Richard M. |last=Gamble |title=Savior Nation: Woodrow Wilson and the Gospel of Service |journal=Humanitas |volume=14 |issue=1 |year=2001 |pages=4\u201322 |doi= |jstor= |url=http://www.nhinet.org/gamble14-1.pdf }}</ref> In early 1918, he issued his principles for peace, the ''[[Fourteen Points]],'' and in 1919, following the signing of an [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice with Germany]], he traveled to Paris, concluding the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Wilson embarked on a nationwide tour to campaign for the treaty, which would have included U.S. entrance into the [[League of Nations]], but was left incapacitated by a stroke in October 1919 and saw the treaty defeated in the Senate.\n\nDespite grave doubts about his health and mental capacity, Wilson served the remainder of his second term and unsuccessfully sought his party's nomination for a third term. In the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 presidential election]], Republican [[Warren G. Harding]] defeated Democratic nominee [[James M. Cox]] in a landslide, and Harding succeeded Wilson in March 1921. [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|Historians and political scientists]] rank Wilson as an above-average president, and his presidency was an important forerunner of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. However, Wilson has also been criticized for his racist views and actions.\n\n==Presidential election of 1912==\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1912}}\n\nWilson became a prominent 1912 presidential contender immediately upon his election as [[Governor of New Jersey]] in 1910, and his clashes with state party bosses enhanced his reputation with the rising [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive movement]].<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Prior to the [[1912 Democratic National Convention]], Wilson made a special effort to win the approval of three-time Democratic presidential nominee [[William Jennings Bryan]], whose followers had largely dominated the Democratic Party since the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]].<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 141\u2013142</ref> Speaker of the House [[Champ Clark]] of Missouri was viewed by many as the front-runner for the nomination, while House Majority Leader [[Oscar Underwood]] of Alabama also loomed as a challenger. Clark found support among the Bryan wing of the party, while Underwood appealed to the conservative [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, especially in the South.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 149\u2013150</ref> On the first ballot of the Democratic National Convention, Clark won a plurality of delegates, and on the tenth ballot, he won a majority of the delegates after the New York [[Tammany Hall]] machine swung behind him. However, the Democratic Party required a nominee to win two-thirds of the delegates to win the nomination, and balloting continued.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 155\u2013156</ref> The Wilson campaign picked up delegates by promising the vice presidency to Governor [[Thomas R. Marshall]] of Indiana, and several Southern delegations shifted their support from Underwood to Wilson, a native Southerner. Wilson finally won two-thirds of the vote on the convention's 46th ballot, and Marshall became Wilson's running mate.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 157\u2013158</ref>\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1912.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|1912 Electoral Vote Map]]\n\nWilson faced two major opponents in the 1912 general election: one-term Republican incumbent [[William Howard Taft]], and former Republican President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who ran a [[third party (United States)|third party]] campaign as the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|\"Bull Moose\" Party]] nominee. A fourth candidate, [[Eugene V. Debs]] of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], would also win a significant share of the popular vote. Roosevelt had broken with his former party at the [[1912 Republican National Convention]] after Taft narrowly won re-nomination, and the split in the Republican Party made Democrats hopeful that they could win the presidency for the first time since the [[1892 United States presidential election|1892 presidential election]].<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 154\u2013155</ref> Roosevelt emerged as Wilson's main challenger, and Wilson and Roosevelt largely campaigned against each other despite sharing similarly progressive platforms that called for a strong, interventionist central government.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 166\u2013167, 174\u2013175</ref> Wilson won 435 of the 531 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] and 41.8% of the popular vote, while Roosevelt won most of the remaining electoral votes and 27.4% of the popular vote, representing one of the [[List of third party performances in United States elections|strongest third party performances]] in U.S. history. Taft won 23.2% of the popular vote but just 8 electoral votes, while Debs won 6% of the popular vote. In the concurrent [[United States elections, 1912|congressional elections]], Democrats retained control of the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and won a majority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Wilson's victory made him the first Southerner to win the presidency since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 173\u2013174</ref>\n\n==Personnel and appointments==\n===Cabinet and administration===\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align= right\n|Name= Wilson\n|President = Woodrow Wilson\n|President start = 1913\n|President end = 1921\n|Vice President = [[Thomas R.

Relations were generally smooth, but he ended weekly meetings with the White House correspondents after the Lusitania sinking in 1915. He also sharply restricted access during the 1919 peace conference. In both cases, Wilson was afraid that publicity would interfere with his quiet diplomacy. Journalists such as [[Walter Lippmann]] found a workaround, discovering that Colonel House was both highly talkative and devious in manipulating the press to slant its stories. A major problem facing the administration was that 90 percent of the major newspapers and magazine outside the South had traditionally favored Republicans. The administration countered this by quietly collaborating with favorable reporters who admired Wilson's leadership in the cause of world peace; their newspapers printed their reports because their scoops made news. The German language press was vehemently hostile to Wilson, but he used this to his advantage, attacking hyphenates as loyal to a foreign country.<ref>James D.

Ultimately, Wilson was able to convince Senate Democrats to vote for Brandeis, and Brandeis would serve until 1939.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 330\u2013332</ref> Another vacancy arose in 1916 after the resignation of [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and Wilson appointed [[John Hessin Clarke]], a progressive lawyer from the electorally-important state of Ohio, to replace Hughes. Clarke would resign from the court in 1922.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 340, 586</ref>\n\nIn addition to his three Supreme Court appointments, Wilson also appointed 20 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]] and 52 judges to the [[United States district courts]].\n\n==Domestic policy==\n===New Freedom===\n[[File:Congress opening message 63rd 02406a.tif|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Wilson giving his first [[State of the Union]] address, the first such address since 1801<ref>{{cite journal| title=Presidential addresses to congress: Woodrow Wilson and the Jeffersonian tradition| last=Hendrix| first=J.

After weeks of hearings and debate, Wilson and Secretary of State Bryan managed to unite Senate Democrats behind the bill.<ref name=cooper216218/> The Senate voted 44 to 37 in favor of the bill, with only one Democrat voting against it and only one Republican, progressive leader [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.]], voting for it. Wilson signed the [[Revenue Act of 1913]] (also known as the Underwood Tariff) into law on October 3, 1913.<ref name=cooper216218>Cooper 2009, pp. 216\u2013218</ref>\n\nThe Revenue Act of 1913 reduced the average import tariff rates from approximately 40 percent to approximately 26 percent.<ref>Clements 1992, p. 39</ref> It also restored a federal income tax for the first time since 1872 (the federal government had also adopted an income tax in the 1890s, but that tax had been struck down by the Supreme Court before taking effect). The Revenue Act of 1913 imposed a one percent tax on incomes above $3,000, with a top tax rate of six percent on those earning more than $500,000 per year. Approximately three percent of the population was subject to the income tax. The bill also included a one percent tax on the net income of all corporations, superseding a previous federal tax that had only applied to corporate net incomes above $5,000.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp. 230\u2013232, 278\u2013282</ref> The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the income tax in the cases of ''[[Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co.]]'' and ''[[Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co.]]''<ref>Weisman 2002, p. 283</ref>\n\nFacing the need for further revenue due to an arms build-up, in 1916 the Wilson administration called for the passage of another major revenue bill. PresidentWilson and congressional allies like Congressman [[Claude Kitchin]] rejected proposal to increase tariff rates, instead favoring increased taxes on high earners.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp. 302\u2013305</ref> Working with progressive Republicans, Congressional Democrats won passage of the [[Revenue Act of 1916]], which reinstated the federal [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]], established a tax on the production of munitions, raised the top income tax rate to fifteen percent, and raised the corporate income tax from one percent to two percent.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp. 306\u2013308</ref> That same year, the President signed a law that established the [[United States International Trade Commission|Tariff Commission]], which was charged with providing expert advice on tariff rates.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 214\u2013215</ref> In the 1920s, Republicans raised tariffs and lowered the income tax. Nonetheless, the policies of the Wilson administration had a durable impact on the composition of government revenue, which after the 1920s would primarily come from taxation rather than tariffs.<ref>Gould 2003, pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\n====Federal Reserve System====\n[[File:Federal Reserve Districts Map - Banks & Branches.png|right|thumb|Map of Federal Reserve Districts\u2013black circles, Federal Reserve Banks\u2013black squares, District branches\u2013red circles and Washington HQ\u2013star/black circle]]\n\nPresident Wilson did not wait to complete the Revenue Act of 1913 before proceeding to the next item on his agenda\u2014banking. By the time Wilson took office, countries like Britain and Germany had established government-run [[central bank]]s, but the United States had not had a central bank since the [[Bank War]] of the 1830s.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 219\u2013220</ref> In the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1907]], there was general agreement among leaders in both parties of the necessity to create some sort of central banking system to provide coordination during financial emergencies. Most leaders also sought currency reform, as they believed that the roughly $3.8 billion in coins and [[banknote]]s did not provide an adequate money supply during financial panics. Under conservative Republican Senator [[Nelson Aldrich]]'s leadership, the [[National Monetary Commission]] had put forward a plan to establish a central banking system that would issue currency and provide oversight and loans to the nation's banks. However, many progressives distrusted the plan due to the degree of influence bankers would have over the central banking system. Relying heavily on the advice of Louis Brandeis, Wilson sought a middle ground between progressives such as Bryan and conservative Republicans like Aldrich.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 40\u201342</ref> He declared that the banking system must be \"public not private, [and] must be vested in the government itself so that the banks must be the instruments, not the masters, of business.\"<ref>Heckscher 1991, pp. 316-17.</ref>\n\nDemocratic Congressmen Carter Glass and [[Robert L. Owen]] crafted a compromise plan in which private banks would control twelve regional [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s, but a controlling interest in the system was placed in a central board filled with presidential appointees. The system of twelve regional banks was designed with the goal of diminishing [[Wall Street]]'s influence. Wilson convinced Bryan's supporters that the plan met their demands for an elastic currency because Federal Reserve notes would be obligations of the government.<ref>Link 1954, pp. 43\u201353</ref> The bill passed the House in September 1913, but it faced stronger opposition in the Senate. After PresidentWilson convinced just enough Democrats to defeat an amendment put forth by bank president [[Frank A. Vanderlip]] that would have given private banks greater control over the central banking system, the Senate voted 54\u201334 to approve the [[Federal Reserve Act]]. Wilson signed the bill into law in December 1913.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 42\u201344</ref> The president appointed [[Paul Warburg]] and other prominent bankers to direct the new system. While power was supposed to be decentralized, the New York branch dominated the Federal Reserve as the \"first among equals.\"<ref name=\"jecreport\">{{cite web|url= http://www.house.gov/jec/fed/fed/fed-impt.htm|title= The Importance of the Federal Reserve|author= Keleher, Robert|date= March 1997|work= Joint Economic Committee|publisher= U.S. House of Representatives|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080228130550/http://www.house.gov/jec/fed/fed/fed-impt.htm|archivedate= 2008-02-28}}</ref> The new system began operations in 1915, and it played an important role in financing the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] and American war effort in World War I.<ref>Link 1956, pp. 199\u2013240</ref>\n\n====Antitrust legislation====\n{{see also|History of United States antitrust law}}\n[[File:Pump1913.jpg|thumb|In a 1913 cartoon, Wilson primes the economic pump with tariff, currency and anti-trust laws]]\n\nHaving passed major legislation lowering the tariff and reforming the banking structure, President Wilson next sought anti-trust legislation to supplant the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 226\u2013227</ref> The Sherman Antitrust Act had barred any \"contract, combination...or conspiracy, in restraint of trade,\" but had proved ineffective in preventing the rise of large business combinations known as [[Trust (business)|trust]]s. Roosevelt and Taft had both escalated antitrust prosecution by the Justice Department, but many progressives desired legislation that would do more to prevent trusts from dominating the economy. While Roosevelt believed that trusts could be separated into \"good trusts\" and \"bad trusts\" based on their effects on the broader economy, Wilson had argued for breaking up all trusts during his 1912 presidential campaign. In December 1913, Wilson asked Congress to pass an anti-trust law that would ban many anti-competitive practices. A month later, in January 1914, he also asked for the creation of an interstate trade commission, eventually known as the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), that would preside over the dissolution of trusts but would play no role in anti-trust prosecution itself.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nWith Wilson's support, Congressman [[Henry De Lamar Clayton Jr.|Henry Clayton, Jr.]] introduced a bill that would ban several anti-competitive practices such [[Price discrimination|discriminatory pricing]], [[Tying (commerce)|tying]], [[exclusive dealing]], and [[interlocking directorate]]s. The bill also allowed individuals to launch anti-trust suits, and it limited the applicability of anti-trust laws on [[trade union|unions]].<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 48\u201349</ref> As the difficulty of banning all anti-competitive practices via legislation became clear, President Wilson came to favor legislation granting the FTC greater discretion to investigate anti-trust violations and enforce anti-trust laws independently of the Justice Department. The [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914]], which incorporated Wilson's ideas regarding the FTC, passed Congress with bipartisan support, and Wilson signed the bill into law in September 1914.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 49\u201350</ref> One month later, Wilson signed the [[Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914]], which built on the Sherman Act by defining and banning several anti-competitive practices.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\n====Labor issues====\n{{see also|Labor history of the United States}}\n \nPresident Taft had established the [[Commission on Industrial Relations]] to study labor issues, but the Senate had rejected all of his nominees to the commission. Upon taking office, Wilson nominated a mix of conservatives and progressive reformers, with commission chairman [[Frank P. Walsh]] falling into the latter group. The commission helped expose numerous labor abuses throughout the nation, and Walsh proposed reforms designed to empower unions.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 75\u201376</ref> Prior to his first presidential inauguration, Wilson had had an uneasy relationship with union leaders such as [[Samuel Gompers]] of the [[American Federation of Labor]], and he generally believed that workers were best protected through laws rather than unions.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 74\u201375</ref> Wilson and Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson]] rejected Walsh's proposed reforms, and instead focused on using the Labor Department to mediate conflicts between labor and ownership.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 76\u201378</ref> The labor policies of Wilson's administration were tested by a strike against the [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|Colorado Fuel and Iron Company]] in late-1913 and early-1914. The company rejected the Labor Department's attempts to mediate, and a militia controlled by the company attacked a miner's camp in what became known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]]. At the Governor of Colorado's request, the Wilson administration sent in troops to end the dispute, but mediation efforts failed after the union called off the strike due to a lack of funds.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 79\u201380</ref>\n\nIn mid-1916, a major railroad strike endangered the nation's economy. The president called the parties to a White House summit in August \u2014 after two days and no results, Wilson proceeded to settle the issue, using the maximum eight-hour work day as its linchpin. Congress passed the [[Adamson Act]], which incorporating the president's proposed eight-hour work day. As a result, the strike was then cancelled. Wilson was praised for averting a national economic disaster, even though the law was received with howls from conservatives, who denounced it as a sellout to the unions and a surrender by Congress to an imperious president.<ref>Heckscher 1991, p. 409.</ref> The Adamson Act was the first federal law that regulated hours worked by private employees.<ref>Cooper 1990, p. 215</ref> In 1916, Wilson signed the [[Keating\u2013Owen Act]], which banned [[child labor in the United States|child labor]]. The act was struck down by the Supreme Court in the 1918 case of ''[[Hammer v. Dagenhart]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n====Agricultural issues====\n\nPresident Wilson's agricultural policies were heavily influenced by [[Walter Hines Page]], who favored a reorganization of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to put less focus on scientific research and more emphasis on using the department to provide education and other services directly to farmers.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 54\u201356</ref> Secretary of Agriculture [[David F. Houston]] presided over the implementation of many of Page's proposed reforms and worked with Congressman [[Asbury Francis Lever]] to introduce the bill that became the [[Smith\u2013Lever Act of 1914]]. This act established government subsidies for a demonstration farming program allowing farmers to voluntarily experiment with farming techniques favored by agricultural experts. Proponents of the Smith\u2013Lever Act overcame many conservatives' objections by adding provisions to bolster local control of the program. Local agricultural colleges supervised the [[agricultural extension]] agents, and the agents were barred from operating without county governments' approval. By 1924, three-quarters of the agriculture-oriented counties in the United States took part in the agricultural extension program.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 56\u201359</ref> Wilson also helped ensure passage of the [[Federal Farm Loan Act]], which created twelve regional banks empowered to provide low-interest loans to farmers.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\n====The Philippines and Puerto Rico====\n\nWilson embraced the long-standing Democratic policy against owning colonies, and he worked for the gradual autonomy and ultimate independence of the [[Philippines]], which had been acquired from [[Spain]] in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Wilson increased self-governance on the islands by granting [[Filipinos]] greater control over the Philippine Legislature. The House passed a measure to grant the Philippines full independence, but Republicans blocked this proposal in the Senate. The [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Act]] of 1916 committed the United States to the eventual independence of the Philippines; independence took place in 1946.<ref>Cooper 2009, p. 249</ref> The [[Jones\u2013Shafroth Act|Jones Act of 1917]] upgraded the status of [[Puerto Rico]], which had also been acquired from Spain in 1898. The act, which superseded the [[Foraker Act]], created the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]], established a bill of rights, and authorized the election of a [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico|Resident Commissioner]] (previously appointed by the president) to a four-year term. The act also granted Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship and exempted [[List of bonds issued by Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican bonds]] from federal, state, and local taxes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Truman R.

Kennedy, ''A Companion to Woodrow Wilson '' (2013) pp 152-72.</ref> Wilson's progressivism encouraged his belief that immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, though poor and illiterate, could assimilate into a homogeneous white middle class, and he opposed the restrictive [[immigration to the United States|immigration policies]] that many members of both parties favored. However, the so-called \"hyphenated\" Irish and German elements repulsed him because he believed that they were motivated to help the wartime needs of [[Ireland]] and Germany, not to the needs and values of the United States.<ref>Hans Vought, \"Division and reunion: Woodrow Wilson, immigration, and the myth of American unity.\" ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' (1994) 13#3: 24-50.

The Japanese government protested strongly, and Wilson sent Secretary of State Bryan to California. Bryan was unable to get California to relax the restrictions, and Wilson accepted the law even though it violated a 1911 treaty with Japan. The law bred resentment in Japan which would linger into the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>Herbert P.

The act's goal was to reduce unskilled European immigration by requiring literacy tests. It was the first U.S. law to restrict immigration from Europe, and it foreshadowed the more restrictive immigration laws of the 1920s.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 376\u2013377</ref>\n\n===Home front during World War I===\n{{main|United States home front during World War I}}\n[[File:FoodWillWinTheGreatWarNOLA.jpg|thumb|Liberty Loan drive in front of City Hall, [[New Orleans]].

Hand chipping with pneumati - NARA - 530774.tif|thumb|Women workers in ordnance shops, Pennsylvania, 1918]]\n\nWith the American entrance into World War I in April 1917, Wilson became a war-time president. The [[War Industries Board]], headed by [[Bernard Baruch]], was established to set U.S. war manufacturing policies and goals. Future President [[Herbert Hoover]] led the [[United States Food Administration|Food Administration]]; the [[Federal Fuel Administration]], run by Henry Garfield, introduced [[daylight saving time]] and rationed fuel supplies; William McAdoo was in charge of war bond efforts; Vance McCormick headed the War Trade Board. These men, known collectively as the \"war cabinet\", met weekly with Wilson at the White House.<ref>Heckscher 1991, p. 469.</ref> Because he was heavily focused on foreign policy during World War I, Wilson delegated a large degree of authority over the home front to his subordinates.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 296\u2013297</ref>\n\nThe great majority of unions, including the AFL and the railroad brotherhoods, supported the war effort, and were rewarded for their efforts with high pay and access to Wilson. Unions saw enormous growth in membership and wages during the war, and strikes were rare.<ref>{{cite book|author=Spencer C.

Wilson's labor policies continued to stress mediation and agreement on all sides. When [[Smith & Wesson]] refused to assent to an NWLB ruling, the War Department seized control of the gun company and forced employees to return to work.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 84\u201385</ref>\n\n====Financing the war====\n\nIn the midst of the war, the federal budget soared from $1 billion in [[fiscal year]] 1916 to $19 billion in fiscal year 1919.<ref name=\"clements156157\"/> In addition to spending on its own military build-up, the United States provided large loans to the Allied countries, helping to prevent the economic collapse of Britain and France. By the end of the war, the United States had become a creditor nation for the first time in its history.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 276, 319</ref> Seeking to avoid the high levels of inflation that had accompanied the heavy borrowing of the [[American Civil War]], the Wilson administration sought to further increase taxes during the war.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp 320</ref> The [[War Revenue Act of 1917]] raised the top tax rate to 67 percent, greatly increased the number of Americans paying the income tax (approximately 5.5 million Americans would pay the income tax in 1920), and levied an [[excess profits tax]] on businesses and individuals.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp. 325\u2013329, 345</ref> The [[Revenue Act of 1918]] raised the top tax rate to 77 percent and further increased other taxes.<ref>Weisman 2002, pp. 337\u2013338</ref>\n\nDespite these tax acts, the United States was forced to borrow heavily to finance the war effort. Treasury Secretary McAdoo authorized the issuing of low-interest war bonds and, to attract investors, made interest on the bonds tax-free. The bonds proved so popular among investors that many borrowed money in order to buy more bonds. The purchase of bonds, along with other war-time pressures, resulted in rising [[inflation]]. However, this inflation was partly matched by rising wages and profits, as farmers, laborers, and business owners benefited from the stimulative effect of government spending.<ref name=\"clements156157\">Clements 1992, pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\n====Propaganda====\n[[File:U.S. Official War Pictures, by Louis Fancher.jpg|thumb|right|\"U.S. Official War Pictures\", CPI poster by [[Louis D.

He set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of posters, pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the [[Four Minute Men]]. The CPI also worked with the Post Office to censor seditious counter-propaganda.<ref>Katherine H.

Herring says that Wilson's idealism was genuine, but that it was structured by blind spots:\n:Wilson's genuine and deeply felt aspirations to build a better world suffered from a certain culture-blindness. He lacked experience in diplomacy and hence an appreciation of its limits. He had not traveled widely outside the United States and knew little of other peoples and cultures beyond Britain, which he greatly admired. Especially in his first years in office, he had difficulty seeing that well-intended efforts to spread U.S. values might be viewed as interference at best, coercion at worst. His vision was further narrowed by the terrible burden of racism, common among the elite of his generation, which limited his capacity to understand and respect people of different colors. Above all, he was blinded by his certainty of America's goodness and destiny.<ref>Herring 2008, p. 381</ref>\n\n===Latin America===\n{{see also|Banana Wars}}\n\nWilson sought closer relations with [[Latin America]], and he hoped to create a [[Pan-Americanism|Pan-American]] organization to arbitrate international disputes. He also negotiated a treaty with Colombia that would have paid that country an indemnity for the U.S. role in the [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|secession]] of [[Panama]], but the Senate defeated this treaty.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 245\u2013247</ref> However, Wilson frequently intervened in Latin American affairs, saying in 1913: \"I am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men.\"<ref>Paul Horgan, ''Great River: the Rio Grande in North American History'' (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1984), 913</ref> The [[Dominican Republic]] had been a de facto American [[protectorate]] since Roosevelt's presidency, but suffered from instability. In 1916, Wilson [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916\u201324)|sent troops to occupy]] the island, and the U.S. soldiers would remain until 1924. In 1915, the U.S. [[United States occupation of Haiti|intervened]] in [[Haiti]] after a revolt overthrew the Haitian government, beginning an occupation that would last until 1919. Wilson also authorized military interventions in [[Cuba]], [[Panama]], and [[Honduras]]. The 1914 [[Bryan\u2013Chamorro Treaty]] converted [[Nicaragua]] into another de facto protectorate, and the U.S. [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|stationed soldiers]] there throughout Wilson's presidency.<ref>Herring 2008, pp. 388-390</ref>\n\nThe [[Panama Canal]] opened in 1914, fulfilling the long-term American goal of building a canal across Central America. The canal provided quick passage between the [[Pacific Ocean]] with the [[Atlantic Ocean]], presenting new opportunities to the shippers and allowing the Navy to quickly transfer warships between the two oceans. In 1916, Wilson used the [[Treaty of the Danish West Indies]] to purchase the [[Danish West Indies]] for $25 million. The new territory was renamed as the [[United States Virgin Islands]].<ref>See [http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/jazz/jb_jazz_virgin_1.html \"U.S. Took Ownership of the Virgin Islands March 31, 1917\" (Library of Congress)]</ref>\n\n====Mexican Revolution====\n{{Main|United States involvement in the Mexican Revolution}}\n\nWilson took office during the [[Mexican Revolution]], which had begun in 1911 after liberals overthrew the military dictatorship of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]. Shortly before Wilson took office, conservatives retook power through a coup led by [[Victoriano Huerta]].<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 96\u201397</ref> Wilson rejected the legitimacy of Huerta's \"government of butchers\" and demanded Mexico hold democratic elections. Wilson's unprecedented approach meant no recognition and doomed Huerta's prospects for establishing a stable government.<ref>Peter V. N.

A strong backlash against the American intervention among Mexicans of all political affiliations convinced Wilson to abandon his plans to expand the U.S. military intervention, but the intervention nonetheless helped convince Huerta to flee from the country.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 98\u201399</ref> A group led by [[Venustiano Carranza]] established control over a significant proportion of Mexico, and Wilson recognized Carranza's government in October 1915.<ref name=\"Clements 1992, pp. 99\u2013100\">Clements 1992, pp. 99\u2013100</ref>\n\nCarranza continued to face various opponents within Mexico, including [[Pancho Villa]], whom Wilson had earlier described as \"a sort of [[Robin Hood]].\"<ref name=\"Clements 1992, pp. 99\u2013100\"/> In early 1916, Pancho Villa raided an American town in New Mexico, killing or wounding dozens of Americans and causing an enormous nationwide American demand for his punishment. Wilson ordered General [[John J. Pershing]] and 4000 troops across the border to capture Villa. By April, Pershing's forces had broken up and dispersed Villas bands, but Villa remained on the loose and Pershing continued his pursuit deep into Mexico. Carranza then pivoted against the Americans and accused them of a punitive invasion; a confrontation with a mob in Parral on April 12 resulted in two dead Americans and six wounded, plus hundreds of Mexican casualties. Further incidents led to the brink of war by late June, when Wilson demanded an immediate release of American soldiers held prisoner. The prisoners were released, tensions subsided, and bilateral negotiations began under the auspices of the Mexican-American Joint High Commission. Eager to withdraw from Mexico due to World War I, Wilson ordered Pershing to withdraw, and the last American soldiers left in February 1917. According to historian Arthur Link, Carranza's successful handling of the American intervention in Mexico left the country free to develop its revolution without American pressure.<ref>Link 1964, 194\u2013221, 280\u2013318; Link 1965, 51\u201354, 328\u2013339</ref> The incident also gave the American army some needed experience and made Pershing a national figure.<ref>Richard C.

The policy hurt the Allies more than the Central Powers, since the Allies were more dependent on American goods.

Wilson believed that a massive military mobilization could only take place after a declaration of war, even though that meant a long delay in sending troops to Europe.

The president said, \"We are the sincere friends of the German people and earnestly desire to remain at peace with them. We shall not believe they are hostile to us unless or until we are obliged to believe it\".<ref>Heckscher 1991, pp. 428\u2013429</ref> After a series of attacks on American ships, Wilson held a Cabinet meeting on March 20; all Cabinet members agreed that the time had come for the United States to enter the war. Wilson called Congress into a special session, which would begin on April 2.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 139\u2013140</ref>\n\nMarch 1917 also brought the first of two revolutions in Russia, which impacted the strategic role of the U.S. in the war. The overthrow of the imperial government removed a serious barrier to America's entry into the European conflict, while the second revolution in November relieved the Germans of a major threat on their eastern front, and allowed them to dedicate more troops to the Western front, thus making U.S. forces central to Allied success in battles of 1918. Wilson initially rebuffed pleas from the Allies to dedicate military resources to an intervention in Russia against the [[Bolshevik]]s, based partially on his experience from attempted intervention in Mexico; nevertheless he ultimately was convinced of the potential benefit and agreed to dispatch a limited force to assist the Allies on the eastern front.<ref>Georg Schild, review of Carl J. Richard \"When the United States Invaded Russia: Woodrow Wilson's Siberian Disaster.\" ''Journal of American History'' 100.3 (2013): 864&ndash;864.[http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/3/864.1.short online]</ref>\n\nWilson addressed Congress on April 2, calling for a declaration of war against Germany. He argued that the Germans were engaged in \"nothing less than war against the government and people of the United States.\" He asked for a military draft to raise the army, increased taxes to pay for military expenses, loans to Allied governments, and increased industrial and agricultural production.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 140\u2013141</ref> The [[declaration of war by the United States]] [[1917 United States declaration of war on Germany|against Germany]] passed Congress by strong bipartisan majorities on April 6, 1917, with opposition from ethnic German strongholds and remote rural areas in the South. The United States would also later [[1917 United States declaration of war on Austria-Hungary|declare war against]] Austria-Hungary in December 1917. The U.S. did not sign a formal alliance with Britain or France but operated as an \"associated\" power\u2014an informal ally with military cooperation through the [[Supreme War Council]] in London.<ref>David F. Trask, ''The United States in the Supreme War Council: American War Aims and Inter-Allied Strategy, 1917\u20131918'' (1961).</ref>\n\nGenerals [[Frederick Funston]] and [[Leonard Wood]] had been contenders for the command of American army forces in Europe, but Funston died just weeks before the United States entered the war, and Wilson distrusted Wood, who was a close ally of Theodore Roosevelt. Wilson instead gave command to General John J. Pershing, who had led the expedition against Pancho Villa.<ref>Berg (2013), pp. 463\u2013464</ref> Pershing would have complete authority as to tactics, strategy, and some diplomacy.<ref>Edward M. Coffman, ''The War to End All Wars'' (1968) ch. 3</ref> Edward House became the president's main channel of communication with the British government, and [[Sir William Wiseman, 10th Baronet|William Wiseman]], a British naval attach\u00e9, was House's principal contact in England. Their personal relationship succeeded in serving the powers well, by overcoming strained relations in order to achieve essential understandings between the two governments. House also became the U.S. representative on the Allies' Supreme War Council.<ref>Heckscher 1991, pp. 460\u2013462.</ref>\n\n====The Fourteen Points====\n{{Main|Fourteen Points}}\n\nWilson sought the establishment of \"an organized common peace\" that would help prevent future conflicts. In this goal, he was opposed not just by the Central Powers, but also the other Allied Powers, who, to various degrees, sought to win concessions and oppose a punitive peace agreement on the Central Powers.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 164\u2013165</ref> He initiated a secret study group named [[The Inquiry]], directed by Colonel House, to prepare for post-ware negotiations.<ref>Heckscher 1991, p. 470.</ref> The Inquiry's studies culminated in a speech by Wilson to Congress on January 8, 1918, wherein he articulated America's long term war objectives. It was the clearest expression of intention made by any of the belligerent nations. The speech, known as the Fourteen Points, was authored mainly by [[Walter Lippmann]] and projected Wilson's progressive domestic policies into the international arena. The first six points dealt with diplomacy, freedom of the seas, and settlement of colonial claims. Then territorial issues were addressed and the final point, the establishment of an association of nations to guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of all nations\u2014a [[League of Nations]]. The address was translated into many languages for global dissemination.<ref>Heckscher 1991, p. 471.</ref>\n\nAside from post-war considerations, Wilson's Fourteen Points were motivated by several factors. Unlike some of the other Allied leaders, Wilson did not call for the total break-up of the Ottoman Empire or the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In offering a non-punitive peace to these nations as well as Germany, Wilson hoped to quickly began negotiations to end the war. Wilson's liberal pronouncements were also targeted at pacifistic and war-weary elements within the Allied countries, including the United States. Additionally, Wilson hoped to woo the Russians back into the war, although he failed in this goal.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 423\u2013424</ref>\n\n====Course of the war====\n\nWith the U.S. entrance into the war, Wilson and Secretary of War Baker launched an expansion of the army, with the goal of creating a 300,000-member [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]], a 440,000-member [[Army National Guard|National Guard]], and a 500,000-member conscripted force known as the \"[[Army of the United States|National Army]].\" Despite some resistance to conscription and to the commitment of American soldiers abroad, large majorities of both houses of Congress voted to impose conscription with the [[Selective Service Act of 1917]]. Seeking to avoid the draft riots of the Civil War, the bill established local draft boards that were charged with determining who should be drafted. By the end of the war, nearly 3 million men would be drafted.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 143\u2013146</ref> The Navy also saw tremendous expansion, and, at the urging of Admiral [[William Sims]], focused on building anti-submarine vessels. Allied shipping losses dropped substantially due to U.S. contributions and a new emphasis on the [[Convoys in World War I|convoy system]].<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 147\u2013149</ref>\n\nThe [[American Expeditionary Forces]] first arrived in France in mid-1917.<ref>Clements 1992, p. 144</ref> Wilson and Pershing rejected the British and French proposal that American soldiers integrate into existing Allied units, giving the United States more freedom of action but requiring for the creation of new organizations and supply chains.<ref>Clements 1992, p. 150</ref> There were only 175,000 American soldiers in Europe at the end of 1917, but by mid-1918 10,000 Americans were arriving in Europe per day. Russia exited the war after the March 1918 signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], allowing Germany to shift soldiers from the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] of the war. The Germans launched a [[Spring Offensive]] against the Allies that inflicted heavy casualties but failed to break the Allied line. Beginning in August, the Allies launched the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] that pushed back the exhausted German army.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 149\u2013151</ref>\n\nBy the end of September 1918, the German leadership no longer believed it could win the war. Recognizing that Wilson would be more likely to accept a peace deal from a democratic government, Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] appointed a new government led by [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]]; Baden immediately sought an armistice with Wilson.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> In the exchange of notes, German and American leaders agreed to incorporate the Fourteen Points in the armistice; House then procured agreement from France and Britain, but only after threatening to conclude a unilateral armistice without them. Wilson ignored Pershing's plea to drop the armistice and instead demand an unconditional surrender by Germany.<ref>Heckscher 1991, pp. 479\u201388.</ref> The Germans signed the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], bringing an end to the fighting. Austria-Hungary had signed the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] eight days earlier, while the Ottoman Empire had signed the [[Armistice of Mudros]] in October.\n\n===Aftermath of World War I===\n====Paris Peace Conference====\n{{Main|Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Aftermath of World War I}}\n[[File:Big four.jpg|thumb|The \"Big Four\" at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, following the end of World War I. Wilson is standing next to [[Georges Clemenceau]] at right.]]\n\nAfter the signing of the armistice, Wilson traveled to Europe to attend the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], thereby becoming the first U.S. president to travel to Europe while in office.<ref>Heckscher 1991, p. 458.</ref> Save for a two-week return to the United States, Wilson remained in Europe for six months, where he focused on reaching a peace treaty to formally end the war. The defeated Central Powers had not been invited to the conference, and anxiously awaited their fate.<ref name=\"herring417420\"/> Wilson proposed that the competing factions of the [[Russian Civil War]] declare a truce and send a joint delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, but other Allied leaders opposed the proposal and no delegation was sent.<ref>Berg (2013), pp. 532\u2013533</ref> Wilson, British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]], and Italian Prime Minister [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] made up the \"[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]],\" the Allied leaders with the most influence at the Paris Peace Conference. Though Wilson continued to advocate his idealistic Fourteen Points, many of the other allies desired revenge. Clemenceau especially sought onerous terms for Germany, while Lloyd George supported some of Wilson's ideas but feared public backlash if the treaty proved too favorable to the Central Powers.<ref name=\"herring417420\">Herring 2008, pp. 417-420</ref>\n\n[[File:Map Europe 1923-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Several new European states were established at the Paris Peace Conference]]\n\nIn pursuit of his League of Nations, Wilson conceded several points to the other powers present at the conference. France pressed for the dismemberment of Germany and the payment of a huge sum in [[war reparation]]s. Wilson resisted these ideas, but Germany was still required to pay war reparations and subjected to [[Allied occupation of the Rhineland|military occupation in the Rhineland]]. Additionally, a [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|clause]] in the treaty specifically named Germany as responsible for the war. Wilson agreed to the creation of [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]] in former German and Ottoman territories, allowing the European powers and Japan to establish de facto colonies in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The Japanese acquisition of German interests in the [[Shandong Peninsula]] of China proved especially [[Shandong Problem|unpopular]], as it undercut Wilson's promise of self-government. However, Wilson won the creation of several new states in Central Europe and the Balkans, including Poland, [[Yugoslavia]], and [[Czechoslovakia]], and the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire were partitioned.<ref>Herring 2008, pp. 421-423</ref> Wilson refused to concede to Italy's demands for territory on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]], leading to a dispute between Yugoslavia and Italy that would not be settled until the signing of the 1920 [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]].<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 182\u2013183</ref> Japan proposed that the conference endorse a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|racial equality clause]].

Wilson very reluctantly accepted these amendments. In addition to the Treaty of Versailles, the Allies also wrote treaties with Austria (the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]), Hungary (the [[Treaty of Trianon]]), the Ottoman Empire (the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]), and Bulgaria (the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]]), all of which incorporated the League of Nations charter.<ref>Heckscher 1991, pp. 551\u2013553.</ref>\n\nThe conference finished negotiations in May 1919, at which point German leaders viewed the treaty for the first time. Some German leaders favored repudiating the treaty, but Germany signed the treaty on June 28, 1919.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 185\u2013186</ref> For his peace-making efforts, Wilson was awarded the 1919 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref name=\"nobelprize1919\">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1919/index.html|title=Woodrow Wilson bio sketch|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014}}</ref> However, the defeated Central Powers protested the harsh terms of the treaty, and several colonial representatives pointed out the hypocrisy of a treaty that established new nations in Europe but allowed continued colonialism in Asia and Africa. Wilson also faced an uncertain domestic battle to ratify the treaty, as Republicans largely opposed it.<ref>Herring 2008, pp. 426-427</ref>\n\n====Treaty ratification debate====\n[[File:WoodrowWilsonVersailles.jpg|upright|thumb|Wilson returning from the Versailles Peace Conference, 1919.]]\n\nThe chances were less than favorable for ratification of the treaty by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, in which Republicans held a narrow majority.<ref name=\"Clements 1992, pp. 190\u2013191\">Clements 1992, pp. 190\u2013191</ref> Public opinion on the treaty was mixed, with intense opposition from most Republicans, Germans, and Irish Catholic Democrats. In numerous meetings with Senators, Wilson discovered opposition had hardened. Despite his weakened physical condition following the Paris Peace Conference, Wilson decided to barnstorm the Western states, scheduling 29 major speeches and many short ones to rally support.<ref>Berg 2013, pp. 619\u201334</ref> Wilson suffered a series of debilitating strokes and had to cut short his trip on in September 1919. He became an invalid in the White House, closely monitored by his wife, who insulated him from negative news and downplayed for him the gravity of his condition.<ref>Berg 2013, pp. 635\u201343</ref>\n\nSenator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] led the opposition to the treaty; he despised Wilson and hoped to humiliate him in the ratification battle. Republicans were outraged by Wilson's failure to discuss the war or its aftermath with them. An intensely partisan battle developed in the Senate, as Republicans opposed the treaty and Democrats largely supported it. The debate over the treaty centered around a debate over the American role in the world community in the post-war era, and Senators fell into three main groups. Most Democrats favored the treaty.<ref name=\"Clements 1992, pp. 190\u2013191\"/> Fourteen Senators, mostly Republicans, become known as the \"[[irreconcilables]],\" as they completely opposed U.S. entrance into the League of Nations. Some of these irreconcilables, such as [[George W. Norris]], opposed the treaty for its failure to support decolonization and disarmament. Other irreconcilables, such as [[Hiram Johnson]], feared surrendering American freedom of action to an international organization. Most sought the removal of Article X the League covenant, which purported to bind nations to defend each other against aggression.<ref name=\"herring427430\">Herring 2008, pp. 427-430</ref> The remaining group of Senators, known as \"reservationists,\" accepted the idea of the league, but sought varying degrees of change to the League to ensure the protection of U.S. sovereignty.<ref name=\"herring427430\"/> Former President Taft and former Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]] both favored ratification of the treaty with some modifications, and their public support for the treaty gave Wilson some chance of winning significant Republican support for ratification.<ref name=\"Clements 1992, pp. 190\u2013191\"/>\n\nDespite the difficulty of winning ratification, Wilson consistently refused to accede to reservations, partly due to concerns about having to re-open negotiations with the other powers if reservations were added.<ref>Clements 1992, pp. 191\u2013192, 200</ref> In mid-November 1919, Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-treaty Democrats to pass a treaty with reservations, but the seriously indisposed Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to defeat ratification. Cooper and Bailey suggest that Wilson's stroke in September had debilitated him from negotiating effectively with Lodge.<ref>Cooper 2009, 544, 557\u2013560; Bailey calls Wilson's rejection, \"The Supreme Infanticide,\" ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945) p. 271.</ref> U.S. involvement in World War I would not formally end until the passage of the [[Knox\u2013Porter Resolution]] in 1921.\n\n====Intervention in Russia====\n{{see also|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}\n\nAfter Russia left World War I following the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917, the Allies sent troops there to prevent a German or [[Bolshevik]] takeover of weapons, munitions and other supplies previously shipped as aid to the pre-revolutionary government.<ref>[[George F. Kennan]], ''Russia Leaves the War'', p. 472, ''et passim''. 1956, repr. 1989, {{ISBN|0-691-00841-8}}.</ref> Wilson loathed the Bolsheviks, who he believed did not represent the Russian people, but he feared that foreign intervention would only strengthen Bolshevik rule. Britain and France pressured him to intervene in order to potentially re-open a second front against Germany, and Wilson acceded to this pressure in the hope that it would help him in post-war negotiations and check Japanese influence in Siberia.<ref>Herring 2008, pp. 414-415</ref> The U.S. sent armed forces to assist the withdrawal of [[Czechoslovak Legions]] along the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], and to hold key port cities at [[Arkhangelsk]] and [[Vladivostok]]. Though specifically instructed not to engage the Bolsheviks, the U.S. forces engaged in several armed conflicts against forces of the new Russian government. Revolutionaries in Russia resented the United States intrusion. Robert Maddox wrote, \"The immediate effect of the intervention was to prolong a bloody civil war, thereby costing thousands of additional lives and wreaking enormous destruction on an already battered society.\"<ref>Robert J. Maddox, ''The Unknown War with Russia'' (San Rafael, CA: Presidio Press, 1977), 137.</ref>\n\n====Other issues====\n\nIn 1919, Wilson guided American foreign policy to \"acquiesce\" in the [[Balfour Declaration]] without supporting Zionism in an official way. Wilson expressed sympathy for the plight of Jews, especially in Poland and France.<ref>Walworth (1986) 473\u201383, esp. p. 481; Melvin I.

Many expressed qualms about Wilson's fitness for the presidency at a time when the League fight was reaching a climax, and domestic issues such as strikes, unemployment, inflation and the threat of Communism were ablaze. No one close to Wilson, including his wife, his physician, or personal assistant, was willing to take responsibility to certify, as required by the Constitution, his \"inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office\".<ref>Cooper 2009, p. 555</ref> Though some members of Congress encouraged Vice President Marshall to assert his claim to the presidency, Marshall never attempted to replace Wilson.<ref name=\"marshallsen\"/> Wilson's lengthy period of incapacity while serving as president was nearly unprecedented; of the previous presidents, only [[James Garfield]] had been in a similar situation, but Garfield retained greater control of his mental faculties and faced relatively few pressing issues.<ref>Cooper 2009, p. 535</ref>\n\n==Elections during the Wilson presidency==\n===Midterm elections of 1914===\n{{Main|United States elections, 1914}}\n\nIn Wilson's first mid-term elections, Republicans picked up sixty seats in the House, but failed to re-take the chamber. In the first Senate elections since the passage of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], Democrats retained their Senate majority. Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party, which had won a handful of Congressional seats in the 1912 election, fared poorly, while conservative Republicans also defeated several progressive Republicans. The continuing Democratic control of Congress pleased Wilson, and he publicly argued that the election represented a mandate for continued progressive reforms.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 273\u2013274</ref> In the ensuing [[64th United States Congress|64th Congress]], Wilson and his allies passed several more laws, though none were as impactful as the major domestic initiatives that had been passed during Wilson's first two years in office.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 213\u2013214</ref>\n\n===Presidential election of 1916===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1916}}\n[[File:Woodrow Wilson, accepting Democratic nomination, 1916.JPG|thumb|Wilson accepts the Democratic Party nomination, 1916]]\n\nWilson, renominated without opposition, employed his campaign slogan \"He kept us out of war\", though he never promised unequivocally to stay out of the war. In his acceptance speech on September 2, 1916, Wilson pointedly warned Germany that submarine warfare resulting in American deaths would not be tolerated, saying \"The nation that violates these essential rights must expect to be checked and called to account by direct challenge and resistance. It at once makes the quarrel in part our own.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=65393 |title=Woodrow Wilson: Speech of Acceptance |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date=September 2, 1916 |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref> [[Vance C.

Wilson, in turn, included in his draft platform a plank that called for all work performed by and for the federal government to provide a minimum wage, an eight-hour day and six-day workweek, health and safety measures, the prohibition of child labour, and (his own additions) safeguards for female workers and a retirement program.<ref>Cooper 2009, p. 335</ref>\n\nThe [[1916 Republican National Convention]] nominated Supreme Court Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] for president. A former governor of New York, Hughes sought to reunify the progressive and conservative wings of the party. Republicans campaigned against Wilson's New Freedom policies, especially tariff reduction, the implementation of higher income taxes, and the Adamson Act, which they derided as \"class legislation.\"<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 248\u2013249</ref> Republicans also attacked Wilson's foreign policy on various grounds, but domestic affairs generally dominated the campaign. As election day neared, both sides saw victory as a strong possibility.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 252\u2013253</ref>\n\n[[U.S. presidential election, 1916|The election]] outcome was in doubt for several days and was determined by several close states. Wilson won California by 3,773 of almost a million votes cast, and New Hampshire by 54 votes. Hughes won [[Minnesota]] by 393 votes out of over 358,000. In the final count, Wilson had 277 electoral votes vs. Hughes's 254. Wilson was able to win by picking up many votes that had gone to Teddy Roosevelt or [[Eugene V. Debs]] in 1912.<ref>[[William M. Leary]], Jr. \"Woodrow Wilson, Irish Americans, and the Election of 1916\", ''The Journal of American History,'' Vol. 54, No. 1. (June 1967), pp. 57\u201372.

Wilson's party also maintained control of Congress, although control in the House would depend on the support of several members of the Progressive Party.<ref name=\"Cooper 2009, pp. 311\u2013312\"/>\n\n===Midterm elections of 1918===\n{{Main|United States elections, 1918}}\nWilson involved himself in the 1918 Democratic congressional primaries, hoping to elect progressive members of Congress who would support his administration's foreign policies. Wilson succeeded in defeating several intra-party opponents, including Senator [[James K. Vardaman]] of Mississippi.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 435\u2013437</ref> However, the general elections saw Republicans take control of both the House and the Senate. Republicans ran against Wilson's foreign policy agenda, especially his proposal for the League of Nations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Busch|first1=Andrew|title=Horses in Midstream|date=1999|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=87\u201391}}</ref>\n\n===Presidential election of 1920===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1920}}\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1920.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Republican nominee Warren G. Harding defeated Democratic nominee James Cox in the 1920 election]]\n\nDespite his ill health, Wilson continued to entertain the possibility of running for a third term. Many of Wilson's advisers tried to convince him that his health precluded another campaign, but Wilson nonetheless asked Secretary of State [[Bainbridge Colby]] to nominate him for president at the [[1920 Democratic National Convention]]. While the convention strongly endorsed Wilson's policies, Democratic leaders were unwilling to support the ailing Wilson for a third term. The convention held several ballots over multiple days, with McAdoo and Governor [[James M. Cox|James Cox]] of Ohio emerging as the major contenders for the nomination.<ref name=\"cooper565569\">Cooper 2009, pp. 565\u2013569</ref> Though McAdoo had served as Secretary of the Treasury under Wilson, and had married [[Eleanor Wilson McAdoo|Wilson's daughter]] in 1914, the president did not back McAdoo's candidacy due in part to McAdoo's perceived lukewarm support for the League of Nations.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 360\u2013361</ref> After dozens of ballots, the convention nominated a ticket consisting of Cox and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]].<ref name=\"cooper565569\"/>\n\nMany expected Theodore Roosevelt to be the 1920 Republican nominee, but his death in January 1919 left the race for the Republican nomination wide open.<ref>Cooper 2009, p. 466</ref> The three major contenders for the Republican nomination were General [[Leonard Wood]], who had been a close friend of Roosevelt, Senator Hiram Johnson, who was Roosevelt's running mate on the 1912 Progressive ticket, and Governor [[Frank Lowden]] of Illinois. When the [[1920 Republican National Convention]] met in June 1920, none of the three major contenders were able to accrue enough support to win the nomination, and party leaders put forward various [[favorite son]] candidates. The party ultimately nominated a [[dark horse]] candidate, Senator [[Warren G. Harding]] of Ohio.<ref>Cooper 1990, pp. 362\u2013364</ref> The Republicans centered their campaign around opposition to Wilson's policies, with Harding promising a \"[[return to normalcy]]\" to the conservative policies that had prevailed at the turn of the century. Wilson largely stayed out of the campaign, although he endorsed Cox and continued to advocate for U.S. membership in the League of Nations. Harding won a landslide victory, taking 60.3% of the popular vote and winning every state outside of the South. Democrats also suffered huge losses in the Congressional and gubernatorial [[United States elections, 1920|elections of 1920]], and the Republicans increased their majorities in both houses of Congress.<ref>Cooper 2009, pp. 569\u2013572</ref>\n\n==Historical reputation==\n\nWilson is generally [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|ranked by historians and political scientists]] as one of the better presidents.<ref name=\"jschuessler1\"/> A 2018 poll of the [[American Political Science Association]]'s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Wilson as the 10th best president.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rottinghaus|first1=Brandon|last2=Vaughn|first2=Justin S.|title=How Does Trump Stack Up Against the Best \u2014 and Worst \u2014 Presidents?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/19/opinion/how-does-trump-stack-up-against-the-best-and-worst-presidents.html/|accessdate=14 May 2018|newspaper=New York Times|date=19 February 2018}}</ref> A 2017 [[C-Span]] poll of historians ranked Wilson as the 11th best president.<ref>{{cite web|title=Presidential Historians Survey 2017|url=https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2017/?page=overall|website=C-Span|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> However, a 2006 poll of historians ranked Wilson's unwillingness to compromise on the Treaty of Versailles as the fourth-worst mistake made by a sitting president.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scholars rate worst presidential errors |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-02-18-presidential-goofs_x.htm |accessdate=31 August 2018 |agency=AP |newspaper=USA Today |date=18 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nMore than any of his predecessors, Wilson took steps towards the creation of a strong federal government that would protect ordinary citizens against the overwhelming power of large corporations.<ref name=\"jzimmerman1\">{{cite news|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Jonathan|title=What Woodrow Wilson Did For Black America|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/woodrow-wilson-racism-213388|accessdate=29 August 2016|publisher=Politico|date=23 November 2015}}</ref> Many of Wilson's accomplishments, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the graduated income tax, and labor laws, continued to influence the United States long after Wilson's death.<ref name=\"jschuessler1\"/> He is generally regarded as a key figure in the establishment of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|Modern American liberalism]], and a strong influence on future presidents such as [[Franklin D.

Bailey]] in two books that remain heavily cited by scholars, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Lost Peace'' (1944) and ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945), Bailey:\n:contended that Wilson's wartime isolationism, as well as his peace proposals at war's end, were seriously flawed. Highlighting the fact that American delegates encountered staunch opposition to Wilson's proposed League of Nations, Bailey concluded that the president and his diplomatic staff essentially sold out, compromising important American ideals to secure mere fragments of Wilson's progressive vision. Hence, while Bailey primarily targeted President Wilson in these critiques, others, including House, did not emerge unscathed.<ref>Scot D. Bruce, \"Woodrow Wilson's House:\nThe Hidden Hand of Wilsonian Progressivism\" '' Reviews in American History'' 45#4 (2017) pp 623-24.</ref>\n\nScot Bruce argues that:\n:More recently, prominent historians such as Thomas J. Knock, [[Arthur Walworth]], and [[John Milton Cooper]], among others, shied away from condemning Wilson and his peacemakers for extensive diplomatic failures in Paris. Instead, they framed Wilsonian progressivism, articulated through the League of Nations, as a comparatively enlightened framework tragically undermined by British and French machinations at the peace conference....Historian [[Margaret MacMillan]], continued this analytical trend in her prize-winning book, ''Paris, 1919: Six Months That Changed the World'' (2001), which characterized Wilson as the frustrated idealist, unable to secure his progressive vision due to opposition from old-guard imperialists in his midst. While realists like Lloyd E. Ambrosius questioned the merits of defining Wilsonian progressivism too idealistically, the idea has persisted that well-intentioned U.S. delegates encountered staunch opposition to Wilson's proposals in Paris, and therefore compromised under pressure. Even the great Wilson scholar, [[Arthur S. Link]], subscribed to a version of this narrative.<ref>Bruce, \"Woodrow Wilson's House:\nThe Hidden Hand of Wilsonian Progressivism\"  (2017) p. 624.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [[A.

Soon after, in 1921, the airport was renamed \"Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field\" for the [[World War I]] pilots Ernest Groves Wold and Cyrus Foss Chamberlain. [[Howard Hughes]] briefly stopped at Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field on his round the world flight in 1938. In 1944 the site was renamed to \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Metropolitan Airport/Wold-Chamberlain Field\", with \"International\" replacing \"Metropolitan\" four years later. Today it is rare to see the Wold\u2013Chamberlain portion of the name used anywhere.\n\nMSP was the main base for [[Northwest Airlines]] starting in 1926 and became the main base of regional carrier [[North Central Airlines]] in 1952. North Central merged with [[Southern Airways]] to form [[Republic Airlines (1979\u20131986)|Republic Airlines]] in 1979; Republic then merged with Northwest in 1986. The combined carrier came to control 79% of traffic at the airport, and merged into [[Delta Air Lines]] in 2010.\n\nGround was broken for the current Charles Lindbergh terminal building on October 26, 1958.<ref name=\"funfacts\">{{cite web|title=Fun Facts|url=http://www.mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|accessdate=June 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609090625/http://mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|archive-date=June 9, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The US $8.5 million, 600,000 square foot (56,000 m<sup>2</sup>) terminal with 24 gates on two concourses was designed by Lyle George Landstrom<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|title=Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport, Lindbergh Terminal, 4300 Glumack Drive, Minneapolis, Minnesota|publisher=|access-date=October 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729230512/http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|archive-date=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> who worked for Cerny Associates and completed on January 13, 1962 and operations began on January 21, 1962.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /><ref name=\"arch\">{{cite journal |date=2002|title=Architecture Minnesota|journal=Architecture Minnesota|volume=28|issue=1|page=49|publisher=Minnesota Society American Institute of Architects}}</ref> Pier D (formerly the Gold Concourse, now Concourse C) was completed in 1971 and Pier A (formerly the Green Concourse, now Concourse G) was completed in 1972 as part of an expansion of the terminal designed by Cerny Associates.<ref name=\"arch\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport: Looking Back and Moving Forward|first=Patrick|last=Hogan|url=http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|year=2013|accessdate=May 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712062310/http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|archive-date=July 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This project also involved rebuilding the existing concourses into bi-level structures equipped with [[Gate (airport)|holding rooms]] and [[jet bridge]]s.<ref name=\"arch\" /> It handles airlines such as Delta, United and others.

Ironically, MSP was selected in part for notorious winter climate, yet the filming period remained stubbornly fair-weathered, forcing film crews to employ copious amounts of fake snow. As filming had to take place during normal airport operations, several features of the airport itself, such as the color-based labeling of different concourses, were present in the movie. This labeling system was replaced beginning in 2000 with the more familiar system of lettered concourses.\n\nDue in part to aircraft noise in south Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs, proposals were made in the 1990s to build a new airport on the fringes of the Twin Cities metro in [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] to handle larger jets and more international traffic.<ref>{{cite web |title=MSP Intl.

A citizen group named ROAR (Residents Opposed to Airport Racket) was created in 1998 and helped push the MAC to make these concessions. Later, in 2004, the MAC voted to reduce funding for the soundproofing projects, saying in part that the economic climate had turned in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Minneapolis Mayor [[R. T. Rybak]], who had been a founding member of ROAR, promised that the city would challenge the changes.\n\nThe Hubert H. Humphrey Terminal was built in 2001. It is used mostly for charter and low cost airlines, including Minnesota-based [[Sun Country Airlines|Sun Country]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]], but is also used for [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]] and [[JetBlue]].

Northwest operated 747-400s from Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to Hong Kong and Osaka in 1998; both were dropped later that year. Northwest also operated DC-10s Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to Oslo and Frankfurt, but they too were dropped. From the early 1990s to the 2000s (decade), [[KLM]] flew 747s and MD-11s from Amsterdam to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. In part because of the Delta/KLM joint venture, KLM did not serve Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul with its own aircraft between 2004 and March 2017, when service resumed. Beginning in the summer of 2013 [[Air France]] commenced non-stop, seasonal Airbus A340-300 flights from [[Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. Service switches to a Boeing 777-200ER in 2019. [[Condor Airlines]] began non-stop seasonal 767-300 service to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul from Frankfurt in the summer of 2014.\n\n[[Great Lakes Airlines]] added services to small communities that had lost service from the legacy carriers in the 2010s, but hub status was removed in 2014, with the airline blaming a lack of qualified pilots. Some service moved to other airports, while other service was picked up by [[Air Choice One]] and [[Boutique Air]].\n\nThe [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] typically screens about 34,000 people at MSP daily and screens about 18,000 checked bags. The airport's current record for passengers and bags was set on February 5, 2018, which was the day after [[Super Bowl LII]]. That record is 60,883 passengers screened at TSA checkpoints and 34,368 checked bags screened.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|title=One Day After 60K-Plus Passengers, MSP Officials Overjoyed|work=KSTP|access-date=February 7, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207015952/http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|archive-date=February 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For the event, the TSA brought in more than 100 additional agents and 20 canines to MSP for the expected number of passengers.\n\n===Future===\nIn 2004 Northwest Airlines proposed expanding the Lindbergh Terminal 1 to accommodate growing flight operations in a plan known as the ''MSP 2020 Vision''. The proposed expansion included moving all airlines other than [[Northwest Airlines]] and its [[SkyTeam]] alliance partners to the Humphrey Terminal 2. This caused increased concern about Northwest Airlines' control of the Minneapolis/St. Paul commercial air service market with some claiming that Northwest was using its market position to inflate airfares. While [[AirTran Airways]] voiced opposition to the plan, [[American Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]] remained neutral on the move since both had exclusive terminals at their own main hubs. Despite the merger between Northwest and [[Delta Air Lines]], there are still plans in place to carry out these expansions. In August 2015, the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) approved a plan that looks out to the year 2035. At the meeting the airlines were split into three groups: All [[SkyTeam]] airlines, [[Southwest Airlines]] and all other passenger airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111800/https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2016  }}</ref>\n\nThe final plan includes three phases through 2020, 2030 and 2035.

Several large [[parking ramp]]s are available for [[automobiles|cars]]. Most other connections are made at the Hub Building and adjacent Transit Center, which has city and shuttle bus, [[taxicab|taxi]], [[light-rail]] and [[renting|rental]] car service. Two [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Airport Trams|trams]] ([[people mover]]s) are at the airport. One carries passengers from the main section of Lindbergh Terminal 1 to the Hub Building and another runs along [[Concourse]] C in that terminal.\n\nThe airport is near [[Fort Snelling]], the site of one of the earliest United States government settlements in the area. Both the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Minnesota River|Minnesota]] rivers flow nearby. [[Minnesota State Highway 5]] provides the closest entrance to the Lindbergh Terminal 1, just a short distance from [[Interstate 494]]. The Humphrey Terminal 2 is accessed via the 34th Avenue exit from I-494, which runs past [[Fort Snelling National Cemetery]]. Delta Air Lines has hangars arranged along I-494 and 34th Avenue, so it's possible to see airliners undergoing maintenance while driving past.\n\n===Runways===\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport covers 2,930 acres (1,186 ha) and has four [[runway]]s, all with high intensity lights.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nRunway 17/35 opened in October 2005.

The terminals are on different sides of the airfield and not interconnected; one who wishes to transfer between terminals must take the free Light Rail.\n\n'''Lindbergh Terminal 1''', the larger of the two terminals, has seven concourses, lettered A\u2013G, although they are all interconnected and can be accessed by either the north or south security checkpoints. Terminal 1 currently has 117 gates. Concourse C has a tram that goes from Gate C1 to gate C27, with a stop in the middle near Gate C12. There is a skyway that connects concourse G with concourse C. All international arrivals at Terminal 1 from airports without border pre-clearance are handled at concourse G. Terminal 1 houses the [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] hub, as well as [[Air Canada]], [[Air Choice One]], [[Alaska Airlines|Alaska]], [[American Airlines|American]], [[Boutique Air]], [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]], [[Spirit Airlines|Spirit]] and [[United Airlines|United]]. Delta operates two Sky Clubs within the terminal, while United operates a United Club in Concourse E.\n\n'''Humphrey Terminal 2''', consists entirely of Concourse H. The old Humphrey Terminal 2, built in 1986, was rebuilt in 2001 to expand capacity and give passengers a more seamless experience.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /> The terminal now has 14 gates and houses the primary hub for [[Sun Country Airlines]], as well as [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]], [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]].\n\n===Ground transportation===\nThe terminal buildings are directly located off of [[Minnesota State Highway 5]]. Several other major highways that border the airport are [[Minnesota State Highway 62 (Hennepin-Dakota Counties)|Minnesota State Highway 62]], [[Minnesota State Highway 77]], and [[Interstate 494]].\n\n[[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] operates bus route 54 to MSP.

Delta Air Lines and its regional affiliates account for about 70% of the airport's passenger traffic. The airport is operated by the [[Metropolitan Airports Commission]], which also handles the operation of six smaller airports in the region.\n\n==History==\n[[File:MSPrunways.jpg|thumb|MSP airport in 2009 looking towards the northeast]]\nThe airport came into being when several local groups came together to take control of the former bankrupt Twin City Speedway race track, giving the airport its original name, [[Speedway Field]]. Soon after, in 1921, the airport was renamed \"Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field\" for the [[World War I]] pilots Ernest Groves Wold and Cyrus Foss Chamberlain. [[Howard Hughes]] briefly stopped at Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field on his round the world flight in 1938. In 1944 the site was renamed to \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Metropolitan Airport/Wold-Chamberlain Field\", with \"International\" replacing \"Metropolitan\" four years later. Today it is rare to see the Wold\u2013Chamberlain portion of the name used anywhere.\n\nMSP was the main base for [[Northwest Airlines]] starting in 1926 and became the main base of regional carrier [[North Central Airlines]] in 1952. North Central merged with [[Southern Airways]] to form [[Republic Airlines (1979\u20131986)|Republic Airlines]] in 1979; Republic then merged with Northwest in 1986. The combined carrier came to control 79% of traffic at the airport, and merged into [[Delta Air Lines]] in 2010.\n\nGround was broken for the current Charles Lindbergh terminal building on October 26, 1958.<ref name=\"funfacts\">{{cite web|title=Fun Facts|url=http://www.mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|accessdate=June 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609090625/http://mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|archive-date=June 9, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The US $8.5 million, 600,000 square foot (56,000 m<sup>2</sup>) terminal with 24 gates on two concourses was designed by Lyle George Landstrom<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|title=Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport, Lindbergh Terminal, 4300 Glumack Drive, Minneapolis, Minnesota|publisher=|access-date=October 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729230512/http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|archive-date=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> who worked for Cerny Associates and completed on January 13, 1962 and operations began on January 21, 1962.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /><ref name=\"arch\">{{cite journal |date=2002|title=Architecture Minnesota|journal=Architecture Minnesota|volume=28|issue=1|page=49|publisher=Minnesota Society American Institute of Architects}}</ref> Pier D (formerly the Gold Concourse, now Concourse C) was completed in 1971 and Pier A (formerly the Green Concourse, now Concourse G) was completed in 1972 as part of an expansion of the terminal designed by Cerny Associates.<ref name=\"arch\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport: Looking Back and Moving Forward|first=Patrick|last=Hogan|url=http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|year=2013|accessdate=May 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712062310/http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|archive-date=July 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This project also involved rebuilding the existing concourses into bi-level structures equipped with [[Gate (airport)|holding rooms]] and [[jet bridge]]s.<ref name=\"arch\" /> It handles airlines such as Delta, United and others.

Ironically, MSP was selected in part for notorious winter climate, yet the filming period remained stubbornly fair-weathered, forcing film crews to employ copious amounts of fake snow. As filming had to take place during normal airport operations, several features of the airport itself, such as the color-based labeling of different concourses, were present in the movie. This labeling system was replaced beginning in 2000 with the more familiar system of lettered concourses.\n\nDue in part to aircraft noise in south Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs, proposals were made in the 1990s to build a new airport on the fringes of the Twin Cities metro in [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] to handle larger jets and more international traffic.<ref>{{cite web |title=MSP Intl.

A citizen group named ROAR (Residents Opposed to Airport Racket) was created in 1998 and helped push the MAC to make these concessions. Later, in 2004, the MAC voted to reduce funding for the soundproofing projects, saying in part that the economic climate had turned in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Minneapolis Mayor [[R. T. Rybak]], who had been a founding member of ROAR, promised that the city would challenge the changes.\n\nThe Hubert H. Humphrey Terminal was built in 2001. It is used mostly for charter and low cost airlines, including Minnesota-based [[Sun Country Airlines|Sun Country]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]], but is also used for [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]] and [[JetBlue]].

Northwest also operated DC-10s Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to Oslo and Frankfurt, but they too were dropped. From the early 1990s to the 2000s (decade), [[KLM]] flew 747s and MD-11s from Amsterdam to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. In part because of the Delta/KLM joint venture, KLM did not serve Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul with its own aircraft between 2004 and March 2017, when service resumed. Beginning in the summer of 2013 [[Air France]] commenced non-stop, seasonal Airbus A340-300 flights from [[Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. Service switches to a Boeing 777-200ER in 2019. [[Condor Airlines]] began non-stop seasonal 767-300 service to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul from Frankfurt in the summer of 2014.\n\n[[Great Lakes Airlines]] added services to small communities that had lost service from the legacy carriers in the 2010s, but hub status was removed in 2014, with the airline blaming a lack of qualified pilots. Some service moved to other airports, while other service was picked up by [[Air Choice One]] and [[Boutique Air]].\n\nThe [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] typically screens about 34,000 people at MSP daily and screens about 18,000 checked bags. The airport's current record for passengers and bags was set on February 5, 2018, which was the day after [[Super Bowl LII]]. That record is 60,883 passengers screened at TSA checkpoints and 34,368 checked bags screened.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|title=One Day After 60K-Plus Passengers, MSP Officials Overjoyed|work=KSTP|access-date=February 7, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207015952/http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|archive-date=February 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For the event, the TSA brought in more than 100 additional agents and 20 canines to MSP for the expected number of passengers.\n\n===Future===\nIn 2004 Northwest Airlines proposed expanding the Lindbergh Terminal 1 to accommodate growing flight operations in a plan known as the ''MSP 2020 Vision''. The proposed expansion included moving all airlines other than [[Northwest Airlines]] and its [[SkyTeam]] alliance partners to the Humphrey Terminal 2. This caused increased concern about Northwest Airlines' control of the Minneapolis/St. Paul commercial air service market with some claiming that Northwest was using its market position to inflate airfares. While [[AirTran Airways]] voiced opposition to the plan, [[American Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]] remained neutral on the move since both had exclusive terminals at their own main hubs. Despite the merger between Northwest and [[Delta Air Lines]], there are still plans in place to carry out these expansions. In August 2015, the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) approved a plan that looks out to the year 2035. At the meeting the airlines were split into three groups: All [[SkyTeam]] airlines, [[Southwest Airlines]] and all other passenger airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111800/https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2016  }}</ref>\n\nThe final plan includes three phases through 2020, 2030 and 2035. The plan moves some, but not all non-SkyTeam airlines from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2, evens out capacity over the two terminals and will finish with as many as 15 new gates being constructed over both terminals and new parking garages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://metroairports.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=1&clip_id=1455&meta_id=8795|title=LTCP MSP 2035|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:MSP Airport Diagram.pdf|thumb|FAA airport diagram]]\n[[File:Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport departures area.jpg|thumb|Delta Ticketing/Check-In at Terminal 1]]\n[[File:Delta - Concourse C @ MSP Airport (8486514293).jpg|thumb|Delta Airlines jets parked at Concourse C]]\nLike many other airports, MSP interconnects with several other forms of transportation. Several large [[parking ramp]]s are available for [[automobiles|cars]]. Most other connections are made at the Hub Building and adjacent Transit Center, which has city and shuttle bus, [[taxicab|taxi]], [[light-rail]] and [[renting|rental]] car service. Two [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Airport Trams|trams]] ([[people mover]]s) are at the airport. One carries passengers from the main section of Lindbergh Terminal 1 to the Hub Building and another runs along [[Concourse]] C in that terminal.\n\nThe airport is near [[Fort Snelling]], the site of one of the earliest United States government settlements in the area. Both the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Minnesota River|Minnesota]] rivers flow nearby. [[Minnesota State Highway 5]] provides the closest entrance to the Lindbergh Terminal 1, just a short distance from [[Interstate 494]]. The Humphrey Terminal 2 is accessed via the 34th Avenue exit from I-494, which runs past [[Fort Snelling National Cemetery]]. Delta Air Lines has hangars arranged along I-494 and 34th Avenue, so it's possible to see airliners undergoing maintenance while driving past.\n\n===Runways===\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport covers 2,930 acres (1,186 ha) and has four [[runway]]s, all with high intensity lights.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nRunway 17/35 opened in October 2005. Prior to that time, a number of buildings (including several hangars and the [[Richfield, Minnesota|City of Richfield]]'s Rich Acres Golf Course) were demolished to make way for the runway protection zone of the new runway.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Aircraft approaching Runway 35 fly slightly east of the [[Mall of America]], overfly [[Interstate 494]] and land seconds later. Due to noise concerns from south [[Minneapolis]], between August 13, 2007 and October 18, 2007, Runway 17/35 was used regularly during construction on Runway 12R/30L.\n\n===Terminals===\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport has two terminals with a total of 131 gates, both of which were named for famous Minnesotans: the Lindbergh Terminal 1 (named after the aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]]) and the smaller Humphrey Terminal 2 (named for former [[United States Vice President|US Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]]). The terminals are on different sides of the airfield and not interconnected; one who wishes to transfer between terminals must take the free Light Rail.\n\n'''Lindbergh Terminal 1''', the larger of the two terminals, has seven concourses, lettered A\u2013G, although they are all interconnected and can be accessed by either the north or south security checkpoints. Terminal 1 currently has 117 gates. Concourse C has a tram that goes from Gate C1 to gate C27, with a stop in the middle near Gate C12. There is a skyway that connects concourse G with concourse C. All international arrivals at Terminal 1 from airports without border pre-clearance are handled at concourse G. Terminal 1 houses the [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] hub, as well as [[Air Canada]], [[Air Choice One]], [[Alaska Airlines|Alaska]], [[American Airlines|American]], [[Boutique Air]], [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]], [[Spirit Airlines|Spirit]] and [[United Airlines|United]]. Delta operates two Sky Clubs within the terminal, while United operates a United Club in Concourse E.\n\n'''Humphrey Terminal 2''', consists entirely of Concourse H. The old Humphrey Terminal 2, built in 1986, was rebuilt in 2001 to expand capacity and give passengers a more seamless experience.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /> The terminal now has 14 gates and houses the primary hub for [[Sun Country Airlines]], as well as [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]], [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]].\n\n===Ground transportation===\nThe terminal buildings are directly located off of [[Minnesota State Highway 5]]. Several other major highways that border the airport are [[Minnesota State Highway 62 (Hennepin-Dakota Counties)|Minnesota State Highway 62]], [[Minnesota State Highway 77]], and [[Interstate 494]].\n\n[[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] operates bus route 54 to MSP. The bus stop is located at Terminal 1. Passengers arriving in Terminal 2 must take the light rail to the bus stop location.\n\nThe [[METRO (Minnesota)|METRO]] light rail [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]]<ref name=\"Metro Transit Route Change Document\">{{cite web|title=These routes will change May 18|url=http://metrotransit.org/routes-change-may-18|publisher=Metro Transit|accessdate=May 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715174842/http://www.metrotransit.org/routes-change-may-18|archive-date=July 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> has stops at both the Hub Building Terminal 1 ([[Airport \u2013 Terminal 1-Lindbergh (Metro Transit station)|Lindbergh Station]]) and Terminal 2 Humphrey Terminal ([[Airport \u2013 Terminal 2-Humphrey (Metro Transit station)|Humphrey Station]]).

Both units fly the [[C-130 Hercules]] and are operationally-gained by the [[Air Mobility Command]] (AMC). The 934th consists of over 1,300 military personnel, of which approximately 250 are full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel. The 133rd is similarly manned, making for a total military presence of over 2,600 full-time and part-time personnel.\n\nThe 934 AW serves as the \"host\" wing for the installation, which also includes

Curson was knighted in 1489 and took part in the tournaments of 1494, and was [[Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk]] in 1496-97. Having married the widow of Sir George Hopton in 1498, he joined the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]] to fight against the Turks in 1499 while in tenure of the post of captain of [[List of Captains, Lieutenants and Lords Deputies of English Calais#Terminology and background|Hammes Castle]] in the approaches to [[Calais]], taking time to visit [[Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk]], at [[Gu\u00eenes]]. It was reported that he had attempted to enlist the Emperor's support for a [[House of York|Yorkist]] attempt against [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]], and he was proclaimed a traitor in 1501, but escaped the condemnation which led to the executions of Sir [[James Tyrrell]] and Sir John Wyndham in 1502, and was made a [[Count of the Holy Roman Empire]] for his exploits against the Turks. He built the large double courtyard mansion which stood on the corner of St Peter's Street and Silent Street, of which the retinue guesthouse survives on the opposite side of Silent Street. Conservative in his religious views, he fed the flames at the martyrdom of the [[Lollardy|Lollard]] Nicholas Peke at the Ipswich Cornhill in 1515, and wrote the account of the \"Ipswich Miracle\"<ref>J.

Wentworth states that he has purchased the house for himself and his heirs, consisting of the site merely, with enclosed gardens, holding the Franciscan order not to be a divinely-planted stock but a hypocritical weed planted by the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]].

Curson was knighted in 1489 and took part in the tournaments of 1494, and was [[Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk]] in 1496-97. Having married the widow of Sir George Hopton in 1498, he joined the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]] to fight against the Turks in 1499 while in tenure of the post of captain of [[List of Captains, Lieutenants and Lords Deputies of English Calais#Terminology and background|Hammes Castle]] in the approaches to [[Calais]], taking time to visit [[Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk]], at [[Gu\u00eenes]]. It was reported that he had attempted to enlist the Emperor's support for a [[House of York|Yorkist]] attempt against [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]], and he was proclaimed a traitor in 1501, but escaped the condemnation which led to the executions of Sir [[James Tyrrell]] and Sir John Wyndham in 1502, and was made a [[Count of the Holy Roman Empire]] for his exploits against the Turks. He built the large double courtyard mansion which stood on the corner of St Peter's Street and Silent Street, of which the retinue guesthouse survives on the opposite side of Silent Street. Conservative in his religious views, he fed the flames at the martyrdom of the [[Lollardy|Lollard]] Nicholas Peke at the Ipswich Cornhill in 1515, and wrote the account of the \"Ipswich Miracle\"<ref>J. Blatchly and D. MacCulloch, ''Miracles in Lady Lane: The Ipswich Shrine at the Westgate'' (D.K. and M.N.

This overlooked the river frontage just below Stoke Bridge, as the Greyfriars had the frontage above the bridge, where a channel of the Gipping flowed towards the tidal water.

Describing himself as the \"founder in blood\" (referring to his hereditary patronage), he explains that the people of Ipswich have been giving their charity to better causes than to this \"nest of drones\". The Warden had informed him that they had been compelled to sell their plate and jewellery to obtain a subsistence, and it was found that Archdeacon Thomas Sillesden had been buying it. Wentworth states that he has purchased the house for himself and his heirs, consisting of the site merely, with enclosed gardens, holding the Franciscan order not to be a divinely-planted stock but a hypocritical weed planted by the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]]. He now begged for the grant of the house.<ref>(Item 651) : 'Henry VIII: April 1538, 1-5', in J.
