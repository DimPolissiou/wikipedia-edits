During February 2012, traditional Himba chiefs issued a declaration to the [[African Union]] and to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] of the [[United Nations]], titled \"Declaration of the most affected Ovahimba, Ovatwa, Ovatjimba and Ovazemba against the Orokawe Dam in the Baynes Mountains,\" which outlines the fierce objections against the dam from the traditional [[Himba people|Himba]] chiefs and communities that reside near the Kunene River.<ref name=\"Galdu\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.galdu.org/web/index.php?odas=5638&giella1=eng|title=Indigenous Himba Appeal to UN to Fight Namibian Dam|publisher=galdu.org|accessdate=April 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017232022/http://www.galdu.org/web/index.php?odas=5638&giella1=eng|archive-date=October 17, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"newsodrome\">{{Cite web|url=http://newsodrome.com/native_american_news/namibian-minority-groups-demand-their-rights-29917361|title=Namibian Minority Groups Demand Their Rights|publisher=newsodrome.com|accessdate=April 6, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017135555/http://newsodrome.com/native_american_news/namibian-minority-groups-demand-their-rights-29917361|archivedate=October 17, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"ep1061\">{{Cite web|url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=1061\n|title=Declaration of the most affected Ovahimba, Ovatwa, Ovatjimba and Ovazemba against the Orokawe Dam in the Baynes Mountains|publisher=earthpeoples.org|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2012, the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on the Rights of [[Indigenous Peoples]] visited the Himba, and heard their concerns.\n\nOn November 23, 2012, hundreds of Himba and Zemba from Omuhonga and Epupa region protested in Okanguati against Namibia's plans to construct a dam in the Kunene River in the Baynes Mountains, against increasing mining operations on their traditional land and human rights violations against them.<ref name=\"Rebecca Sommer\">{{Cite web|url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=2910=eng|title=Namibia: Indigenous semi-nomadic Himba and Zemba march in protest against dam, mining and human rights violations|publisher=earthpeoples.org|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn March 25, 2013, over a thousand Himba and Zemba people marched in Opuwo<ref name=\"Earth Peoples\">{{Cite web|url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=4151|title=German GIZ directly engaged with dispossessing indigenous peoples of their lands and territories in Namibia|publisher=earthpeoples.org|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}</ref> to protest again against Namibia's plans to build the Orokawe dam in the Baynes Mountains at the Cunene River without consulting with the indigenous peoples that do not consent to the construction plans.<ref name=\"The Namibian\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.namibian.com.na/news/full-story/archive/2013/march/article/himba-zemba-reiterate-no-to-baynes-dam/|title=Himba, Zemba reiterate \u2018no\u2019 to Baynes dam|publisher=Catherine Sasman for The Namibian|accessdate=March 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329005913/http://www.namibian.com.na/news/full-story/archive/2013/march/article/himba-zemba-reiterate-no-to-baynes-dam|archive-date=March 29, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Attraction ==\nTourists frequent campsites or lodges in Epupa which offer water sports on the river including rafting and canoeing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kaoko-namibia.com/epupa_falls.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 23, 2013|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422001005/http://www.kaoko-namibia.com/epupa_falls.html |archivedate=April 22, 2013}}</ref> There are ancient baobab trees alongside the gorge, and there is an attractive and well-kept viewpoint high above the village and falls, but both are spoiled by broken bottles and abundant garbage.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book|author=C.

W240) and '''62''' (chassis no. V240) were the first [[automobile]] models of the [[Maybach]] brand since the brand's revival by DaimlerChrysler AG (now [[Daimler AG]]). They are derived from the Benz Maybach concept car presented at the [[Tokyo Motor Show#1997|1997 Tokyo Motor Show]]. The concept car was based on the [[Mercedes-Benz W140]] S-class sedan platform, as were the production models. The [[Luxury Brand Status Index]] 2008 placed the Maybach in first place, ahead of [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Bentley]]. The models ceased production in December 2012 due to continued financial losses for the marque, and sales at one-fifth the level of the profitable Rolls-Royce models.<ref name=\"endofbrand\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[Wilhelm Maybach]] was an engineer who worked with [[Gottlieb Daimler]] to design combustion engines. The first Daimler-Maybach automobile was built in 1889. Over the years, the Maybach name developed into a brand name for automobiles that were typically very large, powerful, and luxurious. For example, the [[Maybach Zeppelin#DS8|Maybach Zeppelin DS 8 Cabriolet]] built in 1929 had side sections that could be lowered completely to allow it to be used as a car in a parade. In 1998, [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler AG]]'s competitor, [[BMW|BMW AG]], purchased the ultra-luxury brand [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Skerrett|first=Joanne|title=Vickers PLC: BMW Deal For Rolls-Royce Signed|newspaper=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|date=30 April 1998}}</ref> The Maybach brand name was reintroduced in 2002 to be a direct challenger to BMW's top vehicle, the [[Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003)|Rolls-Royce Phantom]].\n\n== Design ==\nBoth Maybach models are variants of the same [[luxury vehicle|ultra-luxurious]] automobile. The model numbers reflect the respective lengths of the automobiles in [[decimetre]]s. The 57 is more likely to be owner-driven, while the longer 62 is designed with a [[chauffeur]] in mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15135835/maybach-first-drive-review|title=Maybach|last=Wilkinson|first=Stephan|date=2003-01-01|website=Car and Driver|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Features ===\n[[File:Maybach interior.JPG|thumb|right|Interior]]\nStandard features of all models include, but are not limited to: a navigation system with voice recognition; air conditioning with four-zone climate controls; power rear sunshade; rear-seat DVD entertainment system; interior air filter; front and rear seat massage; 21-speaker Bose premium sound system; power tilt/telescopic heated wood/leather-wrapped steering wheel with radio and climate controls; power trunk open/close; voice-activated AM/FM radio with 6-disc [[CD changer]]; keyless start; heated front and rear seats; cooled front seats; adaptive cruise control; premium leather upholstery; 18-way power front seats; 14-way power rear seats; heated cupholders; rearview camera; [[iPod]] adapter; wireless cell phone link; outside-temperature indicator; universal garage door opener.\n\nOptions for the Maybach 62 and 62S include: 18-way power rear seats (replacing 14-way); power side sunshades; cooled rear seats; wireless headphones; [[Smart glass#Polymer dispersed liquid crystal devices|electrochromic]] power panoramic sunroof (replacing power sunroof); steering wheel mounted navigation controls.\n\nThe company offers various options for customers to personalise their vehicles, and provides various equipment combinations.\n\n=== Performance ===\nThe engine in the base Model 57 and 62 is the Mercedes-Benz M285, a 5.5-litre twin-turbo [[V12 engine|V12]] developed specifically for the new Maybach cars.

The concept car was based on the [[Mercedes-Benz W140]] S-class sedan platform, as were the production models. The [[Luxury Brand Status Index]] 2008 placed the Maybach in first place, ahead of [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Bentley]].

The first Daimler-Maybach automobile was built in 1889. Over the years, the Maybach name developed into a brand name for automobiles that were typically very large, powerful, and luxurious. For example, the [[Maybach Zeppelin#DS8|Maybach Zeppelin DS 8 Cabriolet]] built in 1929 had side sections that could be lowered completely to allow it to be used as a car in a parade. In 1998, [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler AG]]'s competitor, [[BMW|BMW AG]], purchased the ultra-luxury brand [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Skerrett|first=Joanne|title=Vickers PLC: BMW Deal For Rolls-Royce Signed|newspaper=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|date=30 April 1998}}</ref> The Maybach brand name was reintroduced in 2002 to be a direct challenger to BMW's top vehicle, the [[Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003)|Rolls-Royce Phantom]].\n\n== Design ==\nBoth Maybach models are variants of the same [[luxury vehicle|ultra-luxurious]] automobile. The model numbers reflect the respective lengths of the automobiles in [[decimetre]]s. The 57 is more likely to be owner-driven, while the longer 62 is designed with a [[chauffeur]] in mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15135835/maybach-first-drive-review|title=Maybach|last=Wilkinson|first=Stephan|date=2003-01-01|website=Car and Driver|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Features ===\n[[File:Maybach interior.JPG|thumb|right|Interior]]\nStandard features of all models include, but are not limited to: a navigation system with voice recognition; air conditioning with four-zone climate controls; power rear sunshade; rear-seat DVD entertainment system; interior air filter; front and rear seat massage; 21-speaker Bose premium sound system; power tilt/telescopic heated wood/leather-wrapped steering wheel with radio and climate controls; power trunk open/close; voice-activated AM/FM radio with 6-disc [[CD changer]]; keyless start; heated front and rear seats; cooled front seats; adaptive cruise control; premium leather upholstery; 18-way power front seats; 14-way power rear seats; heated cupholders; rearview camera; [[iPod]] adapter; wireless cell phone link; outside-temperature indicator; universal garage door opener.\n\nOptions for the Maybach 62 and 62S include: 18-way power rear seats (replacing 14-way); power side sunshades; cooled rear seats; wireless headphones; [[Smart glass#Polymer dispersed liquid crystal devices|electrochromic]] power panoramic sunroof (replacing power sunroof); steering wheel mounted navigation controls.\n\nThe company offers various options for customers to personalise their vehicles, and provides various equipment combinations.\n\n=== Performance ===\nThe engine in the base Model 57 and 62 is the Mercedes-Benz M285, a 5.5-litre twin-turbo [[V12 engine|V12]] developed specifically for the new Maybach cars.

They didn't. But we did. The 57S version finally gave the hapless guy up front something to do other than stirring up revolutionary resentment towards his boss, but by the time the Landaulet appeared, the game was up, and Mercedes iced the brand in favour of six different versions of the new S-Class.

After a two years' campaign by the [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian-Catholic]] Bishop [[Oxendius V\u0103rz\u0103rescu]], they converted from the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] to the [[Armenian Catholic Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nGherla is the seat of the [[Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Romania]], as well as that of a [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]] [[diocese]] &ndash; the [[Cluj-Gherla Diocese]] ([[suffragan]] to the [[Romanian Greek Catholic Major Archdiocese of F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 and Alba Iulia|Greek-Catholic Archbishop of Alba Iulia and F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219-Blaj]], who resided in [[Blaj]]). In the center of the city lie the Saint [[Gregory the Illuminator]] and the Holy Trinity Armenian Cathedral. The main Armenian-Catholic church was built in 1792. The Greek Catholic diocese was created by the [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Ad Apostolicam Sedem]]'' of November 26, 1853, and the first bishop was [[Ioan Alexi]].\n\nA [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] fortress was built here and converted to a prison in 1785. During the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], the prison was used for political detainees (''see [[Gherla prison]]''). Today it is a Romanian  high-security prison.\n\nThe town is often visited by [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] pilgrims on their way to the nearby village of [[Nicula]] and [[Nicula Monastery]].\n\nGherla also had a significant Jewish population which was decimated during the Holocaust. After the war most of the remaining Jewish population left the city. The [[Gherla Synagogue|''Synagogue'']] and the Holocaust Memorial Monument are visited by tourists from many countries.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Population==\nAccording to the 2011 Romanian census, there were 20,982 people living within the city, as follows:<ref>[http://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-2/ Tab8.
