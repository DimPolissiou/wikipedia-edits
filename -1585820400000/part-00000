(This later paved the way to the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962 and the boundary dispute between China and India that persists today.)\n\nIn 1938, the British finally published the Simla Convention as a bilateral accord and demanded that the Tawang monastery, located south of the McMahon Line, cease paying taxes to Lhasa.

The Tibetans reacted vigorously. The Chinese governor was killed on his way to [[Chamdo]] and his army put to flight after an action near Batang; several missionaries were also murdered, and Chinese fortunes were at a low ebb when a special commissioner called Chao Yu-fong appeared on the scene.\n\nActing with a savagery which earned him the sobriquet of \"The Butcher of Monks,\" he swept down on Batang, sacked the lamasery, pushed on to Chamdo, and in a series of victorious campaigns which brought his army to the gates of Lhasa, re-established order and reasserted Chinese domination over Tibet. In 1909 he recommended that [[Sikang]] should be constituted a separate province comprising thirty-six subprefectures with Batang as the capital. This project was not carried out until later, and then in modified form, for the Chinese Revolution of 1911 brought Chao's career to an end and he was shortly afterwards assassinated by his compatriots.\n\nThe troubled early years of the Chinese Republic saw the rebellion of most of the tributary chieftains, a number of pitched battles between Chinese and Tibetans, and many strange happenings in which tragedy, comedy, and (of course) religion all had a part to play. In 1914 Great Britain, China, and Tibet met at the conference table to try to restore peace, but this conclave broke up after failing to reach agreement on the fundamental question of the Sino-Tibetan frontier. This, since about 1918, has been recognized for practical purposes as following the course of the Upper Yangtze. In these years the Chinese had too many other preoccupations to bother about reconquering Tibet. However, things gradually quieted down, and in 1927 the province of Sikang was brought into being, but it consisted of only twenty-seven subprefectures instead of the thirty-six visualized by the man who conceived the idea. China had lost, in the course of a decade, all the territory which the Butcher had overrun.\n\nSince then Sikang has been relatively peaceful, but this short synopsis of the province's history makes it easy to understand how precarious this state of affairs is bound to be. Chinese control was little more than nominal; I was often to have first-hand experience of its ineffectiveness. In order to govern a territory of this kind it is not enough to station, in isolated villages separated from each other by many days' journey, a few unimpressive officials and a handful of ragged soldiers. The Tibetans completely disregarded the Chinese administration and obeyed only their own chiefs. One very simple fact illustrates the true status of Sikang's Chinese rulers: nobody in the province would accept Chinese currency, and the officials, unable to buy anything with their money, were forced to subsist by a process of barter.\n\nOnce you are outside the North Gate [of Dardo or [[Kangting]]], you say good-by to Chinese civilization and its amenities and you begin to lead a different kind of life altogether. Although on paper the wide territories to the north of the city form part of the Chinese provinces of [[Sikang]] and [[Tsinghai]], the real frontier between China and Tibet runs through Kangting, or perhaps just outside it. The empirical line which Chinese cartographers, more concerned with prestige than with accuracy, draw on their maps bears no relation to accuracy.|[[Andr\u00e9 Migot]]|''Tibetan Marches''<ref>''Tibetan Marches''.

This army was supposed to be large and modern enough to not just defend Tibet, but to also conquer surrounding regions like [[Kham]] which were inhabited by Tibetan peoples. The Tibetan Army was constantly expanded during the 13th Dalai Lama's reign,{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|pp=235, 236}} and had about 10,000 soldiers by 1936. These were adequately armed and trained infantrymen for the time, though the army almost completely lacked machine guns, artillery, planes and tanks.{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|p=246}} In addition to the regular army, Tibet also made use of great numbers of poorly armed village militias.{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|pp=240, 246}} Considering that it was usually outgunned by their opponents, the Tibetan Army performed relatively well against various Chinese warlords in the 1920s and 1930s.{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|pp=235\u2013246}} Overall, the Tibetan soldiers proved to be \"fearless and tough fighters\" during the [[Warlord Era]].{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|p=245}}\n\nDespite this, the Tibetan Army was wholly inadequate to resist the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) during the [[Battle of Chamdo|Chinese invasion]] of 1950.

At that time, the government of Tibet controlled all of [[\u00dc-Tsang]] (Dbus-gtsang) and western [[Kham]] (Khams), roughly coincident with the borders of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] today. Eastern Kham, separated by the [[Yangtze River]], was under the control of Chinese warlord [[Liu Wenhui]]. The situation in Amdo ([[Qinghai]]) was more complicated, with the [[Xining]] area controlled after 1928 by the [[Hui people|Hui]] warlord [[Ma Bufang]] of the family of Muslim warlords known as the [[Ma clique]], who constantly strove to exert control over the rest of Amdo (Qinghai).  Southern Kham along with other parts of Yunnan belonged to the [[Yunnan clique]] from 1915 till 1927, then to Governor and warlord [[Long Yun|Long (Lung) Yun]] until near the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], when [[Du Yuming]] removed him under the order of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Within territory under Chinese control, war was being waged against Tibetan rebels in Qinghai during the [[Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai]].\n\nIn 1918, [[Lhasa]] regained control of [[Chamdo]] and western Kham. A truce set the border at the [[Yangtze River]]. At this time, the government of Tibet controlled all of \u00dc-Tsang and Kham west of the [[Yangtze River]], roughly the same borders as the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] has today. Eastern Kham was governed by local Tibetan princes of varying allegiances. [[Qinghai]] province was controlled by ethnic [[Hui people|Hui]] and pro-[[Kuomintang]] warlord [[Ma Bufang]]. In 1932 [[Qinghai\u2013Tibet War|Tibet invaded Qinghai]], attempting to capture southern parts of Qinghai province, following contention in [[Yushu City, Qinghai|Yushu]], Qinghai over a monastery in 1932. Ma Bufang's Qinghai army defeated the Tibetan armies.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, China was divided by [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] and occupied with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|anti-Japanese war]], but never renounced its claim to sovereignty over Tibet, and made occasional attempts to assert it.\n\nIn 1932, the Muslim [[Qinghai]] and Han-Chinese [[Sichuan]] armies of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] led by Ma Bufang and Liu Wenhui defeated the [[Tibetan Army|Tibetan army]] in the [[Sino-Tibetan War]] when the 13th Dalai Lama tried to seize territory in Qinghai and Xikang.

''The History of Tibet,'' Vol. 1, Routledge 2003 p.14-</ref> and beggars (''ragyabas'') were endemic. The pre-Chinese social system however was rather complex.\n\nEstates (''shiga''), roughly similar to the English [[Manorialism|manorial system]], were granted by the state and were hereditary, though revocable. As agricultural properties they consisted of two kinds: land held by the nobility or monastic institutions (demesne land), and village land (tenement or villein land) held by the central government, though governed by district administrators. Demesne land consisted on average of one half to three quarters of an estate. Villein land belonged to the estates, but tenants normally exercised hereditary usufruct rights in exchange for fulfilling their [[corv\u00e9e]] obligations. Tibetans outside the nobility and the monastic system were classified as serfs, but two types existed and functionally were comparable to [[tenant farmers]]. Agricultural serfs, or \"small smoke\" (''d\u00fcchung'') were bound to work on estates as a corv\u00e9e obligation (''ula'') but they had title to their own plots, owned private goods, were free to move about outside the periods required for their tribute labour, and free of tax obligations. They could accrue wealth and on occasion became lenders to the estates themselves, and could sue the estate owners: village serfs (''tralpa'')were bound to their villages but only for tax and corv\u00e9e purposes, such as road transport duties (''ula''), and were only obliged to pay taxes. Half of the village serfs were man-lease serfs (''mi-bog''), meaning that they had purchased their freedom. Estate owners exercised broad rights over attached serfs, and flight or a monastic life was the only venue of relief. Yet no mechanism existed to restore escaped serfs to their estates, and no means to enforce bondage existed, though the estate lord held the right to pursue and forcibly return them to the land.\n\nAny serf who had absented himself from his estate for three years was automatically granted either commoner (''chi mi'') status or reclassified as a serf of the central government. Estate lords could transfer their subjects to other lords or rich peasants for labour, though this practice was uncommon in Tibet. Though rigid structurally, the system exhibited considerable flexibility at ground level, with peasants free of constraints from the lord of the manor in order once they had fulfilled their corv\u00e9e obligations. Historically, discontent or abuse of the system, according to Warren W. Smith, appears to have been rare.<ref>Warren W.

The Tibetans reacted vigorously. The Chinese governor was killed on his way to [[Chamdo]] and his army put to flight after an action near Batang; several missionaries were also murdered, and Chinese fortunes were at a low ebb when a special commissioner called Chao Yu-fong appeared on the scene.\n\nActing with a savagery which earned him the sobriquet of \"The Butcher of Monks,\" he swept down on Batang, sacked the lamasery, pushed on to Chamdo, and in a series of victorious campaigns which brought his army to the gates of Lhasa, re-established order and reasserted Chinese domination over Tibet. In 1909 he recommended that [[Sikang]] should be constituted a separate province comprising thirty-six subprefectures with Batang as the capital. This project was not carried out until later, and then in modified form, for the Chinese Revolution of 1911 brought Chao's career to an end and he was shortly afterwards assassinated by his compatriots.\n\nThe troubled early years of the Chinese Republic saw the rebellion of most of the tributary chieftains, a number of pitched battles between Chinese and Tibetans, and many strange happenings in which tragedy, comedy, and (of course) religion all had a part to play. In 1914 Great Britain, China, and Tibet met at the conference table to try to restore peace, but this conclave broke up after failing to reach agreement on the fundamental question of the Sino-Tibetan frontier. This, since about 1918, has been recognized for practical purposes as following the course of the Upper Yangtze. In these years the Chinese had too many other preoccupations to bother about reconquering Tibet. However, things gradually quieted down, and in 1927 the province of Sikang was brought into being, but it consisted of only twenty-seven subprefectures instead of the thirty-six visualized by the man who conceived the idea. China had lost, in the course of a decade, all the territory which the Butcher had overrun.\n\nSince then Sikang has been relatively peaceful, but this short synopsis of the province's history makes it easy to understand how precarious this state of affairs is bound to be. Chinese control was little more than nominal; I was often to have first-hand experience of its ineffectiveness. In order to govern a territory of this kind it is not enough to station, in isolated villages separated from each other by many days' journey, a few unimpressive officials and a handful of ragged soldiers. The Tibetans completely disregarded the Chinese administration and obeyed only their own chiefs. One very simple fact illustrates the true status of Sikang's Chinese rulers: nobody in the province would accept Chinese currency, and the officials, unable to buy anything with their money, were forced to subsist by a process of barter.\n\nOnce you are outside the North Gate [of Dardo or [[Kangting]]], you say good-by to Chinese civilization and its amenities and you begin to lead a different kind of life altogether. Although on paper the wide territories to the north of the city form part of the Chinese provinces of [[Sikang]] and [[Tsinghai]], the real frontier between China and Tibet runs through Kangting, or perhaps just outside it.

At that time, the government of Tibet controlled all of [[\u00dc-Tsang]] (Dbus-gtsang) and western [[Kham]] (Khams), roughly coincident with the borders of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] today. Eastern Kham, separated by the [[Yangtze River]], was under the control of Chinese warlord [[Liu Wenhui]]. The situation in Amdo ([[Qinghai]]) was more complicated, with the [[Xining]] area controlled after 1928 by the [[Hui people|Hui]] warlord [[Ma Bufang]] of the family of Muslim warlords known as the [[Ma clique]], who constantly strove to exert control over the rest of Amdo (Qinghai).  Southern Kham along with other parts of Yunnan belonged to the [[Yunnan clique]] from 1915 till 1927, then to Governor and warlord [[Long Yun|Long (Lung) Yun]] until near the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], when [[Du Yuming]] removed him under the order of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Within territory under Chinese control, war was being waged against Tibetan rebels in Qinghai during the [[Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai]].\n\nIn 1918, [[Lhasa]] regained control of [[Chamdo]] and western Kham. A truce set the border at the [[Yangtze River]]. At this time, the government of Tibet controlled all of \u00dc-Tsang and Kham west of the [[Yangtze River]], roughly the same borders as the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] has today.

Smith, Jr.''China's Tibet?: Autonomy Or Assimilation,'' Rowman & Littlefield, 2009 p.14</ref> Slavery did exist, for example, in places like the [[Chumbi Valley]], though British observers like [[Charles Alfred Bell|Charles Bell]] called it 'mild'.<ref>Alex McKay, (ed.) ''The History of Tibet,'' Vol. 1, Routledge 2003 p.14-</ref> and beggars (''ragyabas'') were endemic. The pre-Chinese social system however was rather complex.\n\nEstates (''shiga''), roughly similar to the English [[Manorialism|manorial system]], were granted by the state and were hereditary, though revocable. As agricultural properties they consisted of two kinds: land held by the nobility or monastic institutions (demesne land), and village land (tenement or villein land) held by the central government, though governed by district administrators. Demesne land consisted on average of one half to three quarters of an estate. Villein land belonged to the estates, but tenants normally exercised hereditary usufruct rights in exchange for fulfilling their [[corv\u00e9e]] obligations. Tibetans outside the nobility and the monastic system were classified as serfs, but two types existed and functionally were comparable to [[tenant farmers]]. Agricultural serfs, or \"small smoke\" (''d\u00fcchung'') were bound to work on estates as a corv\u00e9e obligation (''ula'') but they had title to their own plots, owned private goods, were free to move about outside the periods required for their tribute labour, and free of tax obligations. They could accrue wealth and on occasion became lenders to the estates themselves, and could sue the estate owners: village serfs (''tralpa'')were bound to their villages but only for tax and corv\u00e9e purposes, such as road transport duties (''ula''), and were only obliged to pay taxes. Half of the village serfs were man-lease serfs (''mi-bog''), meaning that they had purchased their freedom. Estate owners exercised broad rights over attached serfs, and flight or a monastic life was the only venue of relief. Yet no mechanism existed to restore escaped serfs to their estates, and no means to enforce bondage existed, though the estate lord held the right to pursue and forcibly return them to the land.\n\nAny serf who had absented himself from his estate for three years was automatically granted either commoner (''chi mi'') status or reclassified as a serf of the central government. Estate lords could transfer their subjects to other lords or rich peasants for labour, though this practice was uncommon in Tibet. Though rigid structurally, the system exhibited considerable flexibility at ground level, with peasants free of constraints from the lord of the manor in order once they had fulfilled their corv\u00e9e obligations. Historically, discontent or abuse of the system, according to Warren W. Smith, appears to have been rare.<ref>Warren W.

{"title_page": "Covenant (biblical)", "text_new": "{{short description|A religious covenant that is described in the Bible.}}\n{{about|biblical covenants||Covenant (disambiguation)}}\n{{Bible related|state=collapsed}}\n\nA '''biblical covenant''' is a [[Covenant (religion)|religious covenant]] that is described in the [[Bible]]. All [[Abrahamic religions]] consider biblical covenants important. \n\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] contains the [[Covenant (biblical)#Noahic covenant|Noahic Covenant]] (in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]), which is between God and all living creatures, as well as a number of more specific covenants with individuals or groups. Biblical covenants include those with Abraham, the whole Israelite people, the Israelite priesthood, and the Davidic lineage of kings. In form and terminology, these covenants echo the kinds of treaty agreements in the surrounding ancient world.\n\nIn the [[Book of Jeremiah]], verses {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|31:30\u201333|HE}} predict \"a new covenant\" that God will establish with \"the house of Israel\". Most [[Christian theology|Christians believe]] this [[New Covenant#Christianity|New Covenant]] is the [[Supersessionism|\"replacement\" or \"final fulfilment\"]] of the [[Old Covenant]] described in the [[Old Testament]] and as applying to the [[People of God]], while some believe both covenants are still applicable in a [[dual covenant theology]].\n\n==Ancient Near Eastern treaties==\nThere are two major types of covenants in the Hebrew Bible, including the obligatory type and the promissory type.<ref name=\"Weinfeld2005\">{{cite book|author=Moshe Weinfeld|title=Normative and Sectarian Judaism in the Second Temple Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QHUAwAAQBAJ|date=20 June 2005|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-567-04441-9|page=200}}</ref> The obligatory covenant is more common with the [[Hittites|Hittite]] peoples, and deals with the relationship between two parties of equal standing. In contrast, the promissory type of covenant is seen in the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants. Promissory covenants focus on the relationship between the suzerain and the vassal and are similar to the \"royal grant\" type of legal document, which include historical introduction, border delineations, stipulations, witnesses, blessings, and curses. In royal grants, the master could reward a servant for being loyal. God rewarded Abraham, Noah, and David in his covenants with them.<ref>Weinfeld, M. (2005). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-QHUAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Weinfeld+Normative+and+Sectarian+Judaism&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZyqnu773WAhVDKCYKHUfACzoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Weinfeld%20Normative%20and%20Sectarian%20Judaism&f=false Normative and Sectarian Judaism in the Second Temple Period].'' United States: T & T Clark International.</ref> As part of his covenant with Abraham, God has the obligation to keep Abraham's descendants as God's chosen people and be their God. God acts as the suzerain power and is the party of the covenant accompanied by the required action that comes with the oath whether it be fire or animals in the sacrificial oaths.  In doing this, God is the party taking upon the curse if he does not uphold his obligation.  Through history there were also many instances where the vassal was the one who performed the different acts and took the curse upon them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Terminology of covenants===\nWeinfeld believes that similar terminology and wording can connect the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants with ancient Near Eastern grants, as opposed to being largely similar to the Mosaic covenant, which, according to Weinfeld, is an example of a suzerainty treaty. He goes on to argue that phrases about ~*_having a \"whole heart\" or having \"walked after me [God] with all his heart\" strongly parallels with Neo-Assyrian grant language, such as \"walked with royalty\". He further argues that in Jeremiah, God uses prophetic metaphor to say that David will be adopted as a son. Expressing legal and political relationships through familial phraseology was common among Near Eastern cultures.

He also argues that during this consolidation, the new state also had to unify the religious traditions that belonged to the different groups to prevent dissent from those who might believe that the formation of a state would replace direct governance from God. Therefore, Mendenhall continues, these loosely bound tribes merged under the Mosaic covenant to legitimize their unity. They believed that to obey the law was to obey God. They also believed that the king was put into power as a result of God's benefaction, and that this accession was the fulfillment of God's promise of dynasty to David. Mendenhall also notes that a conflict arose between those who believed in the Davidic covenant, and those who believed that God would not support all actions of the state. As a result, both sides became relatively aloof, and the Davidic covenant and the Mosaic covenant were almost entirely forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mendenhall|first1=George E.|title=Covenant Forms in Israelite Tradition|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist|date=September 1954|volume=17|issue=3|pages=70\u201373|publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research|location=New Haven, Conn.|jstor=3209151|doi=10.2307/3209151}}</ref>_*~\n\n==Number of biblical covenants==\nStudents of the Bible hold wildly differing opinions as to how many major covenants exist (or did exist) between God and humanity, with numbers ranging from one to at least twelve.\n(See [[covenant theology]] and [[dispensationalism]] for further information on two of the major viewpoints.)

It is the obligation of the master to his servant and involves gifts given to individuals who were loyal serving their masters. In the covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15, it is God who is the suzerain who commits himself and swears to keep the promise. In the covenant there are procedures for taking the oath, which involve a smoking oven and a blazing torch. There are many similarities between Genesis 15 and the Abba-El deed. In Genesis 15 and similarly in the Abba-El deed, it is the superior party who places himself under oath. The oaths in both, moreover, involve a situation wherein the inferior party delivers the animals while the superior party swears the oath. \n\nThe Abrahamic covenant is part of a tradition of covenantal sacrifices that dates back to the third millennium BC. The animals that are slaughtered in the covenant in Genesis 15 are considered a sacrificial offering. And it is that covenant which preserves the sacrificial element alongside the symbolic act.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Weinfeld|first1=M.|title=The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient near East|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1970|volume= 90|issue= 2|pages=196\u2013199}}</ref>\n\n==Mosaic covenant==\n[[File:Ten Commandments Monument.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Ten Commandments]] on a monument on the grounds of the [[Texas State Capitol]]]]\n{{Main|Mosaic covenant}}\n{{See also|Ten Commandments|613 commandments|Law of Moses}}\nThe [[Mosaic covenant]] made with Moses and the Israelite people at Horeb-Sinai, which is found in {{bibleref2|Exodus|19\u201324}} and the book of [[Deuteronomy]], contains the foundations of the [[Torah|written Torah]] and the [[Oral Torah]].

Thus when King David wanted to establish [[Ancient Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] as his own capital city he brought the Ark there (2 Sam 6).\n\n\"It is this picture of the covenant which colours most of our thinking about covenant in the Old Testament, and in the expression 'Law and Gospel' it represents the ''old covenant'' of the law [of Moses] in contrast with the ''new covenant'' of the gospel [of Jesus Christ].

All [[Abrahamic religions]] consider biblical covenants important. \n\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] contains the [[Covenant (biblical)#Noahic covenant|Noahic Covenant]] (in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]), which is between God and all living creatures, as well as a number of more specific covenants with individuals or groups. Biblical covenants include those with Abraham, the whole Israelite people, the Israelite priesthood, and the Davidic lineage of kings. In form and terminology, these covenants echo the kinds of treaty agreements in the surrounding ancient world.\n\nIn the [[Book of Jeremiah]], verses {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|31:30\u201333|HE}} predict \"a new covenant\" that God will establish with \"the house of Israel\". Most [[Christian theology|Christians believe]] this [[New Covenant#Christianity|New Covenant]] is the [[Supersessionism|\"replacement\" or \"final fulfilment\"]] of the [[Old Covenant]] described in the [[Old Testament]] and as applying to the [[People of God]], while some believe both covenants are still applicable in a [[dual covenant theology]].\n\n==Ancient Near Eastern treaties==\nThere are two major types of covenants in the Hebrew Bible, including the obligatory type and the promissory type.<ref name=\"Weinfeld2005\">{{cite book|author=Moshe Weinfeld|title=Normative and Sectarian Judaism in the Second Temple Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QHUAwAAQBAJ|date=20 June 2005|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-567-04441-9|page=200}}</ref> The obligatory covenant is more common with the [[Hittites|Hittite]] peoples, and deals with the relationship between two parties of equal standing. In contrast, the promissory type of covenant is seen in the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants. Promissory covenants focus on the relationship between the suzerain and the vassal and are similar to the \"royal grant\" type of legal document, which include historical introduction, border delineations, stipulations, witnesses, blessings, and curses. In royal grants, the master could reward a servant for being loyal. God rewarded Abraham, Noah, and David in his covenants with them.<ref>Weinfeld, M. (2005). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-QHUAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Weinfeld+Normative+and+Sectarian+Judaism&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZyqnu773WAhVDKCYKHUfACzoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Weinfeld%20Normative%20and%20Sectarian%20Judaism&f=false Normative and Sectarian Judaism in the Second Temple Period].'' United States: T & T Clark International.</ref> As part of his covenant with Abraham, God has the obligation to keep Abraham's descendants as God's chosen people and be their God. God acts as the suzerain power and is the party of the covenant accompanied by the required action that comes with the oath whether it be fire or animals in the sacrificial oaths.  In doing this, God is the party taking upon the curse if he does not uphold his obligation.  Through history there were also many instances where the vassal was the one who performed the different acts and took the curse upon them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Terminology of covenants===\nWeinfeld believes that similar terminology and wording can connect the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants with ancient Near Eastern grants, as opposed to being largely similar to the Mosaic covenant, which, according to Weinfeld, is an example of a suzerainty treaty. He goes on to argue that phrases about having a \"whole heart\" or having \"walked after me [God] with all his heart\" strongly parallels with Neo-Assyrian grant language, such as \"walked with royalty\". He further argues that in Jeremiah, God uses prophetic metaphor to say that David will be adopted as a son. Expressing legal and political relationships through familial phraseology was common among Near Eastern cultures. Babylonian contracts often expressed fathership and sonship in their grants to actually mean a king to vassal relationship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weinfield|first1=M.|title=The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient near East|date=April\u2013June 1970|publisher=American Oriental Society|location=Jerusalem|pages=184\u2013203|edition=Vol 90|url=http://wisdomintorah.s3.amazonaws.com/medialibrary/Grants-and-covenant.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2015|ref=Journal of the American Oriental Society}}</ref>\n\nFurther underlying the idea that these covenants were grant-like in nature is the similar language used in both. In the grant of [[Ashurbanipal]], an Assyrian, to his servant Bulta, he describes Bulta's loyalty with the phrase \"kept the charge of my kinship\". Abraham similarly kept God's charge in Genesis 26: 4\u20135: \"I will give to your descendants all these lands...in as much as Abraham obeyed me and kept my charge, my commandments, my rules and my teachings.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weinfeld|first1=M.|title=The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient near East|journal=American Oriental Society|date=April\u2013June 1970|volume=90|issue=2|pages=186\u2013188|ref=Journal of the American Oriental Society}}</ref>\n\n===Dissolving covenant form===\nAccording to Mendhenhall, pressures from outside invaders led the loosely bound Israelite tribes to converge into monarchical unity for stability and solidarity. He also argues that during this consolidation, the new state also had to unify the religious traditions that belonged to the different groups to prevent dissent from those who might believe that the formation of a state would replace direct governance from God. Therefore, Mendenhall continues, these loosely bound tribes merged under the Mosaic covenant to legitimize their unity. They believed that to obey the law was to obey God. They also believed that the king was put into power as a result of God's benefaction, and that this accession was the fulfillment of God's promise of dynasty to David. Mendenhall also notes that a conflict arose between those who believed in the Davidic covenant, and those who believed that God would not support all actions of the state.

It is the obligation of the master to his servant and involves gifts given to individuals who were loyal serving their masters. In the covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15, it is God who is the suzerain who commits himself and swears to keep the promise. In the covenant there are procedures for taking the oath, which involve a smoking oven and a blazing torch. There are many similarities between Genesis 15 and the Abba-El deed. In Genesis 15 and similarly in the Abba-El deed, it is the superior party who places himself under oath. The oaths in both, moreover, involve a situation wherein the inferior party delivers the animals while the superior party swears the oath. \n\nThe Abrahamic covenant is part of a tradition of covenantal sacrifices that dates back to the third millennium BC. The animals that are slaughtered in the covenant in Genesis 15 are considered a sacrificial offering. And it is that covenant which preserves the sacrificial element alongside the symbolic act.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Weinfeld|first1=M.|title=The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient near East|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1970|volume= 90|issue= 2|pages=196\u2013199}}</ref>\n\n==Mosaic covenant==\n[[File:Ten Commandments Monument.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Ten Commandments]] on a monument on the grounds of the [[Texas State Capitol]]]]\n{{Main|Mosaic covenant}}\n{{See also|Ten Commandments|613 commandments|Law of Moses}}\nThe [[Mosaic covenant]] made with Moses and the Israelite people at Horeb-Sinai, which is found in {{bibleref2|Exodus|19\u201324}} and the book of [[Deuteronomy]], contains the foundations of the [[Torah|written Torah]] and the [[Oral Torah]].

The Davidic covenant is an important element in [[Jewish messianism]] and [[Christian theology]]. In [[Jewish eschatology]], the [[messiah]] is believed to be a future Jewish king from the [[Davidic line]], who will be anointed with [[holy anointing oil]], gather the Jews back into the [[Land of Israel]], usher in an era of peace, build the [[Third Temple]], have a male heir, re-institute the [[Sanhedrin]] and rule the Jewish people during the [[Messianic Age]].\n\nThe tablets of the Ten Commandments were kept in the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and this became the symbol of the Israelite nation, and of God's presence with His people. Thus when King David wanted to establish [[Ancient Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] as his own capital city he brought the Ark there (2 Sam 6).\n\n\"It is this picture of the covenant which colours most of our thinking about covenant in the Old Testament, and in the expression 'Law and Gospel' it represents the ''old covenant'' of the law [of Moses] in contrast with the ''new covenant'' of the gospel [of Jesus Christ].

It is often thought of as an [[Eschatology|eschatological]] [[Messianic Age]] or [[world to come]] and is related to the biblical concept of the [[Kingdom of God]].\n\nGenerally, [[Christian theology|Christians believe]] that the New Covenant was instituted at the [[Last Supper]] as part of the [[Eucharist]], which in the [[Gospel of John]] includes the [[New Commandment]].
