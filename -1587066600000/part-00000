An Opus stream can support up to 255 [[Channel (communications)|audio channels]], and it allows [[joint encoding|channel coupling]] between channels in groups of two using mid-side coding.\n\nOpus has very short [[Latency (audio)|latency]] (26.5&nbsp;ms using the default 20&nbsp;ms frames and default application setting), which makes it suitable for [[real-time computing|real-time applications]] such as [[telephony]], [[Voice over IP]] and [[videoconferencing]]; research by [[Xiph.Org Foundation|Xiph]] led to the [[CELT]] codec, which allows the highest quality while maintaining low delay. In any Opus stream, the bitrate, bandwidth, and delay can be continually varied without introducing any distortion or discontinuity; even mixing packets from different streams will cause a smooth change, rather than the distortion common in other codecs. Unlike Vorbis, Opus does not require large [[Codebook#Data compression|codebooks]] for each individual file, making it more efficient for short clips of audio and more resilient.\n\nAs an open standard, the algorithms are openly documented, and a [[reference implementation]] (including the [[source code]]) is published. [[Broadcom]] and the Xiph.Org Foundation own [[software patent]]s on some of the CELT algorithms, and [[Skype Technologies]]/Microsoft own some on the SILK algorithms; each offers a royalty-free perpetual for use with Opus, reserving only the right to make use of their patents to defend against infringement suits of third parties.

In Opus, both were modified to support more frame sizes, as well as further algorithmic improvements and integration, such as using CELT's [[range encoding|range encoder]] for both types. To minimize overhead at low bitrates, if latency is not as pressing, SILK has support for packing multiple 20&nbsp;ms frames together, sharing context and headers; SILK also allows Low Bit-Rate Redundancy (LBRR) frames, allowing low-quality packet loss recovery. CELT includes both spectral replication and noise generation, similar to AAC's SBR and PNS, and can further save bits by filtering out all harmonics of tonal sounds entirely, then replicating them in the decoder.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/celt/demo.html |title=next generation audio: CELT update 20101223 |date=December 23, 2010 |first=Christopher |last=Montgomery |authorlink=Chris Montgomery}}</ref> Better tone detection is an ongoing project to improve quality.\n\nThe format has three different modes: speech, hybrid, and CELT. When compressing speech, SILK is used for audio frequencies up to 8&nbsp;kHz. If wider bandwidth is desired, a hybrid mode uses CELT to encode the frequency range above 8&nbsp;kHz. The third mode is pure-CELT, designed for general audio. SILK is inherently VBR and cannot hit a bitrate target, while CELT can always be encoded to any specific number of bytes, enabling hybrid and CELT mode when CBR is required.\n\nSILK supports frame sizes of 10, 20, 40 and 60&nbsp;ms. CELT supports frame sizes of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20&nbsp;ms. Thus, hybrid mode only supports frame sizes of 10 and 20&nbsp;ms; frames shorter than 10&nbsp;ms will always use CELT mode. A typical Opus packet contains a single frame, but packets of up to 120&nbsp;ms are produced by combining multiple frames per packet. Opus can transparently switch between modes, frame sizes, bandwidths, and channel counts on a per-packet basis, although specific applications may choose to limit this.\n\nThe reference implementation is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and compiles on hardware architectures with or without a [[floating-point unit]], although floating-point is currently required for audio bandwidth detection (dynamic switching between SILK, CELT, and hybrid encoding) and most speed optimizations.\n\n===Containers===\nOpus packets are not self-delimiting, but are designed to be used inside a [[Container file format|container]] of some sort which supplies the decoder with each packet's length. Opus was originally specified for encapsulation in [[Ogg]] containers, specified as <code>audio/ogg; codecs=opus</code>, and for Ogg Opus files the <code>.opus</code> filename extension is recommended.<ref name=\"Ogg\" /> Opus streams are also supported in [[Matroska]],<ref name=\"Matroska\">{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.matroska.org/pipermail/matroska-users/2013-September/006883.html |title=MKVToolNix v6.4.0 released |first=Moritz |last=Bunkus |mailinglist=Matroska users |date=2013-09-16 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref> [[WebM]],<ref name=webm-guidelines>{{cite web|title=WebM Container Guidelines|url=http://www.webmproject.org/docs/container/|website=The WebM Project|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> [[MPEG-TS]],<ref name=\"mpeg-ts\">{{cite web |url=https://smpte-ra.org/registered-mpeg-ts-ids |title=List of Registered MPEG TS Identifiers \u2013 SMPTE Registration Authority, LLC |date=2019-01-05 |publisher=SMPTE |accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref> and [[MP4]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vfrmaniac.fushizen.eu/contents/opus_in_isobmff.html |title=Encapsulation of Opus in ISO Base Media File Format |date=2018-08-28 |accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, each Opus packet may be wrapped in a [[network packet]] which supplies the packet length.

It is based on two initially separate standard proposals from the Xiph.Org Foundation and Skype Technologies S.A. (now [[Microsoft]]). Its main developers are Jean-Marc Valin (Xiph.Org, Octasic, [[Mozilla Corporation]]), Koen Vos (Skype), and Timothy B. Terriberry (Xiph.Org, Mozilla Corporation). Among others, Juin-Hwey (Raymond) Chen ([[Broadcom]]), Gregory Maxwell (Xiph.Org, [[Wikimedia community|Wikimedia]]), and [[Christopher Montgomery]] (Xiph.Org) were also involved.\n\nThe development of the CELT part of the format goes back to thoughts on a successor for [[Vorbis]] under the working name ''Ghost''. As a newer speech codec from the Xiph.Org Foundation, Opus replaces Xiph's older speech codec [[Speex]], an earlier project of Jean-Marc Valin. CELT has been worked on since November 2007.\n\nThe SILK part has been under development at Skype since January 2007 as the successor of their [[SVOPC]], an internal project to make the company independent from third-party codecs like [[internet Speech Audio Codec|iSAC]] and [[internet Low Bitrate Codec|iLBC]] and respective license payments.\n\nIn March 2009, Skype suggested the development and standardization of a wideband audio format within the IETF. Nearly a year passed with much debate on the formation of an appropriate [[working group]].<ref name=\"WGformation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/IETF-working-towards-royalty-free-audio-codec-859394.html|title=IETF working towards royalty-free audio codec |publisher=H-online.com |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2016-04-07}}</ref> Representatives of several companies which were taking part in the standardization of patent-encumbered competing formats stated objections against the start of the standardization process for a royalty-free format: representatives of [[Polycom]] and [[Ericsson]]\u2014the creators and licensors of [[G.719]]\u2014as well as [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9com]], [[Huawei]] and the [[Orange Labs]] (department of France T\u00e9l\u00e9com), which were involved in the creation of [[G.718]]. The working group finally formed in February 2010, and even the corresponding Study Group 16 from the ITU-T pledged to support its work.\n\nIn July 2010, a prototype of a hybrid format was presented that combined the two proposed format candidates SILK and CELT. In September 2010, Opus was submitted to the IETF as proposal for standardization. For a short time the format went under the name of ''Harmony'' before it got its present name in October 2010.<ref name=\"renaming\">{{cite mailing list |url=http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/codec/current/msg01852.html |title=Harmony became Opus |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2016-01-03 |mailinglist=codec |publisher=IETF |last=Vos |first=Koen}}</ref> At the beginning of February 2011, the [[bitstream]] format was tentatively frozen, subject to last changes.<ref name=\"pre-freeze\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogenaud.io/forums/?showtopic=86580 |title=IETF Opus codec now ready for testing |publisher=Hydrogenaudio |accessdate=2012-09-12}}</ref> Near the end of July 2011, Jean-Marc Valin was hired by the [[Mozilla Corporation]] to continue working on Opus.<ref name=\"job\">{{cite web|url=http://jmspeex.livejournal.com/7352.html | first = Jean-Marc | last = Valin | title= IETF update, Mozilla |publisher= LiveJournal.com|date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref> In November 2011, the working group issued the last call for changes on the bitstream format.

An Opus stream can support up to 255 [[Channel (communications)|audio channels]], and it allows [[joint encoding|channel coupling]] between channels in groups of two using mid-side coding.\n\nOpus has very short [[Latency (audio)|latency]] (26.5&nbsp;ms using the default 20&nbsp;ms frames and default application setting), which makes it suitable for [[real-time computing|real-time applications]] such as [[telephony]], [[Voice over IP]] and [[videoconferencing]]; research by [[Xiph.Org Foundation|Xiph]] led to the [[CELT]] codec, which allows the highest quality while maintaining low delay. In any Opus stream, the bitrate, bandwidth, and delay can be continually varied without introducing any distortion or discontinuity; even mixing packets from different streams will cause a smooth change, rather than the distortion common in other codecs. Unlike Vorbis, Opus does not require large [[Codebook#Data compression|codebooks]] for each individual file, making it more efficient for short clips of audio and more resilient.\n\nAs an open standard, the algorithms are openly documented, and a [[reference implementation]] (including the [[source code]]) is published. [[Broadcom]] and the Xiph.Org Foundation own [[software patent]]s on some of the CELT algorithms, and [[Skype Technologies]]/Microsoft own some on the SILK algorithms; each offers a royalty-free perpetual for use with Opus, reserving only the right to make use of their patents to defend against infringement suits of third parties. [[Qualcomm]], [[Huawei]], [[France Telecom]], and [[Ericsson]] have claimed that their patents may apply, which Xiph's legal counsel denies, and none have pursued any legal action.<ref name=\"OpusLicense\">{{cite web |url=https://www.opus-codec.org/license/ |title=Opus Codec License |publisher=Xiph.org |accessdate=2015-12-22}}</ref><ref name=\"osnews\">{{cite web |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/26892/Nokia_s_VP8_patent_claims_we_ve_been_here_before |title=Nokia's VP8 patent claims: we've been here before |publisher=OSNews |date=2013-05-25 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}</ref> The Opus license automatically and retroactively terminates for any entity that attempts to file a patent suit.\n\n[[File:FSsongmetal2-Opus-exp7.20120823-sweep.png|thumb|400px|right|[[Spectrogram]] of Opus-encoded audio as bitrate rises (~32 to ~160&nbsp;kbit/s) clearly shows lowpass behavior and better preservation of the band energy with CELT (compare [[Commons:Opus#Spectrograms in comparison|original, Vorbis, MP3, AAC]]).]]\n\nThe Opus format is based on a combination of the full-bandwidth [[CELT]] format and the speech-oriented [[SILK]] format, both heavily modified: CELT is based on the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) that most music codecs use, using [[Code-excited linear prediction|CELP]] techniques in the frequency domain for better prediction, while SILK uses [[linear predictive coding]] (LPC) and an optional Long-Term Prediction filter to model speech. In Opus, both were modified to support more frame sizes, as well as further algorithmic improvements and integration, such as using CELT's [[range encoding|range encoder]] for both types. To minimize overhead at low bitrates, if latency is not as pressing, SILK has support for packing multiple 20&nbsp;ms frames together, sharing context and headers; SILK also allows Low Bit-Rate Redundancy (LBRR) frames, allowing low-quality packet loss recovery. CELT includes both spectral replication and noise generation, similar to AAC's SBR and PNS, and can further save bits by filtering out all harmonics of tonal sounds entirely, then replicating them in the decoder.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/celt/demo.html |title=next generation audio: CELT update 20101223 |date=December 23, 2010 |first=Christopher |last=Montgomery |authorlink=Chris Montgomery}}</ref> Better tone detection is an ongoing project to improve quality.\n\nThe format has three different modes: speech, hybrid, and CELT. When compressing speech, SILK is used for audio frequencies up to 8&nbsp;kHz. If wider bandwidth is desired, a hybrid mode uses CELT to encode the frequency range above 8&nbsp;kHz. The third mode is pure-CELT, designed for general audio. SILK is inherently VBR and cannot hit a bitrate target, while CELT can always be encoded to any specific number of bytes, enabling hybrid and CELT mode when CBR is required.\n\nSILK supports frame sizes of 10, 20, 40 and 60&nbsp;ms. CELT supports frame sizes of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20&nbsp;ms. Thus, hybrid mode only supports frame sizes of 10 and 20&nbsp;ms; frames shorter than 10&nbsp;ms will always use CELT mode. A typical Opus packet contains a single frame, but packets of up to 120&nbsp;ms are produced by combining multiple frames per packet. Opus can transparently switch between modes, frame sizes, bandwidths, and channel counts on a per-packet basis, although specific applications may choose to limit this.\n\nThe reference implementation is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and compiles on hardware architectures with or without a [[floating-point unit]], although floating-point is currently required for audio bandwidth detection (dynamic switching between SILK, CELT, and hybrid encoding) and most speed optimizations.\n\n===Containers===\nOpus packets are not self-delimiting, but are designed to be used inside a [[Container file format|container]] of some sort which supplies the decoder with each packet's length.

It is based on two initially separate standard proposals from the Xiph.Org Foundation and Skype Technologies S.A. (now [[Microsoft]]). Its main developers are Jean-Marc Valin (Xiph.Org, Octasic, [[Mozilla Corporation]]), Koen Vos (Skype), and Timothy B. Terriberry (Xiph.Org, Mozilla Corporation). Among others, Juin-Hwey (Raymond) Chen ([[Broadcom]]), Gregory Maxwell (Xiph.Org, [[Wikimedia community|Wikimedia]]), and [[Christopher Montgomery]] (Xiph.Org) were also involved.\n\nThe development of the CELT part of the format goes back to thoughts on a successor for [[Vorbis]] under the working name ''Ghost''. As a newer speech codec from the Xiph.Org Foundation, Opus replaces Xiph's older speech codec [[Speex]], an earlier project of Jean-Marc Valin. CELT has been worked on since November 2007.\n\nThe SILK part has been under development at Skype since January 2007 as the successor of their [[SVOPC]], an internal project to make the company independent from third-party codecs like [[internet Speech Audio Codec|iSAC]] and [[internet Low Bitrate Codec|iLBC]] and respective license payments.\n\nIn March 2009, Skype suggested the development and standardization of a wideband audio format within the IETF. Nearly a year passed with much debate on the formation of an appropriate [[working group]].<ref name=\"WGformation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/IETF-working-towards-royalty-free-audio-codec-859394.html|title=IETF working towards royalty-free audio codec |publisher=H-online.com |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2016-04-07}}</ref> Representatives of several companies which were taking part in the standardization of patent-encumbered competing formats stated objections against the start of the standardization process for a royalty-free format: representatives of [[Polycom]] and [[Ericsson]]\u2014the creators and licensors of [[G.719]]\u2014as well as [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9com]], [[Huawei]] and the [[Orange Labs]] (department of France T\u00e9l\u00e9com), which were involved in the creation of [[G.718]]. The working group finally formed in February 2010, and even the corresponding Study Group 16 from the ITU-T pledged to support its work.\n\nIn July 2010, a prototype of a hybrid format was presented that combined the two proposed format candidates SILK and CELT. In September 2010, Opus was submitted to the IETF as proposal for standardization.

Xiph's reference implementation is called ''libopus'' and a package called ''opus-tools'' provides command-line encoder and decoder utilities. It is published under the terms of a [[BSD licenses|BSD-like license]]. It is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and can be compiled for hardware architectures with or without a [[floating-point unit]]. The accompanying diagnostic tool ''opusinfo'' reports detailed technical information about Opus files, including information on the standard compliance of the bitstream format. It is based on ''ogginfo'' from the ''vorbis-tools'' and therefore&nbsp;\u2014 unlike the encoder and decoder&nbsp;\u2014 is available under the terms of version 2 of the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].\n\n===Implementations===\n{{IETF RFC|6716}} contains a complete source code for the reference implementation written in C.

The distinction comes from the use in homeopathy of substances that are meant to cause similar effects as the symptoms of a disease to treat patients (''homeo'' - meaning similar).\n\nAs used by homeopaths, the term ''allopathy'' has always referred to the principle of curing disease by administering substances that produce other symptoms (when given to a healthy human) than the symptoms produced by a disease. For example, part of an allopathic treatment for [[fever]] may include the use of a drug which reduces the fever, while also including a drug (such as an [[Antibacterial|antibiotic]]) that attacks the cause of the fever (such as a bacterial infection). A homeopathic treatment for fever, by contrast, is one that uses a diluted dosage of a substance that in an undiluted form would induce fever in a healthy person. These preparations are typically diluted so heavily that they no longer contain any actual particles of the original substance. Hahnemann used this term to distinguish medicine as practiced in his time from his use of infinitesimally small (or nonexistent) doses of substances to treat the spiritual causes of illness. \n\nThe ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine'' states that \"[Hahnemann] gave an all-embracing name to regular practice, calling it 'allopathy'. This term, however imprecise, was employed by his followers and other unorthodox movements to identify the prevailing methods as constituting nothing more than a competing 'school' of medicine, however dominant in terms of number of practitioner proponents and patients.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bynum |first1=W. F. |title=Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136110368 |page=608 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gyidO-ZLdiYC&pg=PA608}}</ref>\n\nContrary to the present usage, Hahnemann reserved the term \"allopathic medicine\" to the practice of treating diseases by means of drugs inducing symptoms unrelated (i.e., neither similar nor opposite) to those of the disease. He called the practice of treating diseases by means of drugs producing symptoms opposite to those of the patient \"enantiopathic\" or \"antipathic medicine.\"<ref>e.g., see [https://books.google.com/books?id=n3YC435gKFIC& Organon, VI edition], paragraphs 54-56</ref> After Hahnemann's death, the term \"enantiopathy\" fell into disuse and the two concepts of allopathy and enantiopathy have been more or less unified. Both, however, indicate what Hahnemann thought about the medical practices of his time, rather than the ideas of the present. Conventional physicians of the 19th century had never assumed that the therapeutic effects of drugs were necessarily related to the symptoms they caused in the healthy (e.g. [[James Lind]] systematically tested several common substances and foods for their effect in treating [[scurvy]] in 1747 and discovered that lemon juice was specifically effective. He did not conduct any studies of these substances in healthy volunteers).\n\n==Current==\nThe term is used in the modern era to differentiate between two types of US medical schools (both of which teach aspects of science-based medicine and neither of which teach homeopathy): Allopathic (granting the MD title) and Osteopathic (granting the DO title).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpplc.indiana.edu/medicine/med-res-twokinds.shtml|title=Two Kinds of Physicians - Health Professions and Prelaw Center - Indiana University - University Division|website=www.hpplc.indiana.edu|accessdate=27 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/medical-school-admissions-doctor/2012/04/23/how-to-decide-between-an-md-and-a-do|title=How to Decide Between an M.D. and a D.O.|last1=Prep|first1=Veritas|publisher=US News and World Report|accessdate=27 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nUse of the term remains common among homeopaths and has spread to other [[alternative medicine]] practices.

The distinction comes from the use in homeopathy of substances that are meant to cause similar effects as the symptoms of a disease to treat patients (''homeo'' - meaning similar).\n\nAs used by homeopaths, the term ''allopathy'' has always referred to the principle of curing disease by administering substances that produce other symptoms (when given to a healthy human) than the symptoms produced by a disease. For example, part of an allopathic treatment for [[fever]] may include the use of a drug which reduces the fever, while also including a drug (such as an [[Antibacterial|antibiotic]]) that attacks the cause of the fever (such as a bacterial infection). A homeopathic treatment for fever, by contrast, is one that uses a diluted dosage of a substance that in an undiluted form would induce fever in a healthy person. These preparations are typically diluted so heavily that they no longer contain any actual particles of the original substance. Hahnemann used this term to distinguish medicine as practiced in his time from his use of infinitesimally small (or nonexistent) doses of substances to treat the spiritual causes of illness. \n\nThe ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine'' states that \"[Hahnemann] gave an all-embracing name to regular practice, calling it 'allopathy'. This term, however imprecise, was employed by his followers and other unorthodox movements to identify the prevailing methods as constituting nothing more than a competing 'school' of medicine, however dominant in terms of number of practitioner proponents and patients.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bynum |first1=W.

He called the practice of treating diseases by means of drugs producing symptoms opposite to those of the patient \"enantiopathic\" or \"antipathic medicine.\"<ref>e.g., see [https://books.google.com/books?id=n3YC435gKFIC& Organon, VI edition], paragraphs 54-56</ref> After Hahnemann's death, the term \"enantiopathy\" fell into disuse and the two concepts of allopathy and enantiopathy have been more or less unified. Both, however, indicate what Hahnemann thought about the medical practices of his time, rather than the ideas of the present. Conventional physicians of the 19th century had never assumed that the therapeutic effects of drugs were necessarily related to the symptoms they caused in the healthy (e.g. [[James Lind]] systematically tested several common substances and foods for their effect in treating [[scurvy]] in 1747 and discovered that lemon juice was specifically effective. He did not conduct any studies of these substances in healthy volunteers).\n\n==Current==\nThe term is used in the modern era to differentiate between two types of US medical schools (both of which teach aspects of science-based medicine and neither of which teach homeopathy): Allopathic (granting the MD title) and Osteopathic (granting the DO title).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpplc.indiana.edu/medicine/med-res-twokinds.shtml|title=Two Kinds of Physicians - Health Professions and Prelaw Center - Indiana University - University Division|website=www.hpplc.indiana.edu|accessdate=27 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/medical-school-admissions-doctor/2012/04/23/how-to-decide-between-an-md-and-a-do|title=How to Decide Between an M.D. and a D.O.|last1=Prep|first1=Veritas|publisher=US News and World Report|accessdate=27 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nUse of the term remains common among homeopaths and has spread to other [[alternative medicine]] practices.

The reasons were a disagreement with the bishop of [[Diocese of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]], Albino Luciani, the future [[Pope]] [[John Paul I]], over the appointment of the local priest.\n\n== Background ==\nMontaner is a [[frazione]] in the municipality of [[Sarmede]] in the [[Province of Treviso]], Italy. After the local priest, Giuseppe Fa\u00e8, died on December 13th, 1966, the citizens did not agree with Luciani's decision to appoint Giovanni Gava as new priest. Instead, they supported Antonio Botteon, who, for a long time, had assisted the old priest, and as last resort, asked to have Botteon as vice-rector of the [[parish]].\n \nLuciani replied that for a village as small as Montaner a priest was enough, while noting that priests are not elected by the people but rightfully appointed by their bishop. The bishop appointed as temporary rector a former Franciscan, Father Casimiro, from [[Monselice]], again failing to meet the citizens' requests.\n\nThe last decision of Luciani was to appoint a new rector, Pietro Varnier: with a bold move, some disgruntled citizens on September 12, 1967 locked Varnier in the attic of the rectory. Luciani then arrived in Montaner, escorted by police, and took away the [[Blessed Sacrament]] from the Church, leaving the Church unblessed.\n\n== The schism ==\n[[File:Montaner - Chiesa ortodossa - Foto di Paolo Steffan.jpg|thumb|280px|The Orthodox Church of Montaner]]\nThe people then founded the Orthodox Church of Montaner. On December 26, 1967, the first [[Divine Liturgy]] was celebrated with the Orthodox Byzantine rite.

The reasons were a disagreement with the bishop of [[Diocese of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]], Albino Luciani, the future [[Pope]] [[John Paul I]], over the appointment of the local priest.\n\n== Background ==\nMontaner is a [[frazione]] in the municipality of [[Sarmede]] in the [[Province of Treviso]], Italy. After the local priest, Giuseppe Fa\u00e8, died on December 13th, 1966, the citizens did not agree with Luciani's decision to appoint Giovanni Gava as new priest. Instead, they supported Antonio Botteon, who, for a long time, had assisted the old priest, and as last resort, asked to have Botteon as vice-rector of the [[parish]].\n \nLuciani replied that for a village as small as Montaner a priest was enough, while noting that priests are not elected by the people but rightfully appointed by their bishop. The bishop appointed as temporary rector a former Franciscan, Father Casimiro, from [[Monselice]], again failing to meet the citizens' requests.\n\nThe last decision of Luciani was to appoint a new rector, Pietro Varnier: with a bold move, some disgruntled citizens on September 12, 1967 locked Varnier in the attic of the rectory. Luciani then arrived in Montaner, escorted by police, and took away the [[Blessed Sacrament]] from the Church, leaving the Church unblessed.\n\n== The schism ==\n[[File:Montaner - Chiesa ortodossa - Foto di Paolo Steffan.jpg|thumb|280px|The Orthodox Church of Montaner]]\nThe people then founded the Orthodox Church of Montaner. On December 26, 1967, the first [[Divine Liturgy]] was celebrated with the Orthodox Byzantine rite. The Orthodox priest, Claudio Vettorazzo, was permanently installed in June 1969 and on September 7, 1969, the Orthodox church was blessed.\n\nIn 1994, Vettorazzo was imprisoned for legal and financial problems.<ref>[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1994/agosto/05/sesso_droga_casa_del_vescovo_co_0_9408058135.shtml Sexe et drogue dans la maison de l'''\u00e9v\u00eaque'']</ref>\n \nOnly after 1998 was the Orthodox Church of Montaner officially recognized by the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople]], to use the [[Byzantine Rite]].

He made his first-team debut against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 18 March 1975 and played a total of six league matches that season.

He was consigned to the sidelines as Watford lost 2\u20130 to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Nonetheless, Rostron won the Player of the Season award again that year.
