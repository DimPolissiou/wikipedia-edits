Konaka]], and produced by [[Yasuyuki Ueda]], with original character design by [[Yoshitoshi ABe]].\n\nThe events take place in the vibrant yet dilapidated underground city of Lux. Denizens of Lux have come to call it \"The City\" and treat it as a sentient force. Three factions vie for control of the city: the Organo, a strictly professional conglomerate with ties to the criminal underworld in the prostheses business (\"Texhnolyze\"); the Salvation Union, a fanatical populist group interfering with the Organo's affairs; and the Racan, a marauding group of Texhnolyzed youths. The series has an ensemble cast, but events particularly focus on Ichise, a stoic [[prize fighter]] who loses a leg and an arm to satisfy an enraged promoter; Onishi, a young but level-headed executive of the Organo who has many enemies; and Ran, a little girl who has a very important gift that affects the entire city. As they struggle to accept the challenges that they are dealt, the characters bear witness to major events that determine the survival and fate of the city.\n\n''Texhnolyze'' aired on [[Fuji Television]] from April 16, 2003 to September 24, 2003 and aired twenty episodes. Two un-aired episodes were included in the DVD release. [[Geneon USA]]'s English dub of the series aired in the United States on [[STARZ!]]'s [[Starz Encore|Encore Action]] channel in 2006, then aired again on [[Toku (TV network)|FUNimation Channel]] and FUNimation Channel on Demand when [[FUNimation Entertainment]] licensed the series from Geneon Entertainment. It also aired in Canada on [[G4techTV Canada]]'s [[Anime Current]] block in the mid-2000s.\n\nJapanese [[visual kei]] singer [[Gackt]]'s song ''[[Tsuki no Uta]]'' was selected as its ending theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcuni.co.jp/rondorobe/anime/TEXHNOLYZE/note/item_cd02.html|title=TEXHNOLYZE|publisher=Rondo Robe|accessdate=2019-02-02|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a man-made underground society, descendants of a banished generation live for control of the crumbling city of Lux. Ichise, an orphan turned prize fighter, loses a leg and an arm to satisfy an enraged fight promoter. On the brink of death he is taken in by a young woman doctor and used as a guinea pig for the next evolution of Texhnolyze. With his new limbs, Ichise is taken under the wing of Onishi, a powerful leader of the Organo, an organization with some hold on Lux. As Ichise is drawn deeper into a war for territorial control of the city, he learns of his possible future from the young girl prophet Ran, who guides him from the shadows in his darkest times. With the explosion of open warfare, Ichise must uncover the truth about Lux and fight for his survival as he realizes his destiny.\n\n== Characters ==\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Ichise}}|\u6adf\u58eb}}\n:{{Voiced by|Satoshi Haga|[[Justin Gross]]}}\n:Ichise is a street fighter of very few words who participates in underground fight clubs for money.

Meanwhile, Ichise finds a hallucination of Ran underground, saying that he came back for her to protect her since she has been looking after him all this time.

An enraged Ichise begins to beat the people to a bloody pulp, even when his texhnolyzed limbs seem to function without the source of the obelisk. All the Shapes have rooted to the ground and permanently immobilized, including Kohakura. At an abandoned [[opera house]], Ichise finds Kano, who has failed in his attempt to use texhnolyzation to get people to evolve out of their violent ways, and now humanity's self-preserving bloodline has returned to its roots. Kano unveils that Ran, who has been turned into one of the Shapes, turned her mind off by her own will. Ichise begins to lose control at the sight of Ran. Kano warns that if he, the only sane person left, is killed, Ichise will be left to embrace his own madness, which then leads Ichise to punch Kano's head off in response. Ichise drops Ran's remains into the pool of raffia. He leans against a column, watching a projection of a simplistic rendering of one of Ran's flowers. Eventually, he slumps over and smiles as he and the city fade away.\n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Texhnolyze}}\n* {{ann|anime|2304}}\n* {{IMDb title|0409630}}\n* {{tv.com show|texhnolyze|Texhnolyze}}\n* [https://myanimelist.net/anime/26/Texhnolyze Texhnolyze] on [[MyAnimeList]]\n* ANN\n** [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/texhnolyze/dvd-1 Review of disk 1]\n** [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/texhnolyze/dvd-complete-series-anime-classics Series review]\n\n{{Madhouse}}\n\n[[Category:2003 anime television series]]\n[[Category:Anime with original screenplays]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:Geneon USA]]\n[[Category:Madhouse (company)]]\n[[Category:NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]]\n[[Category:Psychological anime and manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2010}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Texhnolyze\n| image           = Texhnolyze DVD vol 1.jpg\n| caption         = North American cover of the first DVD volume\n| ja_kanji        = \u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\n| ja_romaji       = Tekunoraizu\n| genre           = [[Cyberpunk]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Texhnolyze: Complete Box Set |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/56244/texhnolyze/ |publisher=[[DVD Talk]] |accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref> [[Psychological fiction|psychological]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Texhnolyze |url=https://www.funimation.com/shows/texhnolyze/ |publisher=Funimation |accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref><!-- Note: Use and cite reliable sources to identify genre/s, not personal interpretation.

Konaka]], and produced by [[Yasuyuki Ueda]], with original character design by [[Yoshitoshi ABe]].\n\nThe events take place in the vibrant yet dilapidated underground city of Lux. Denizens of Lux have come to call it \"The City\" and treat it as a sentient force. Three factions vie for control of the city: the Organo, a strictly professional conglomerate with ties to the criminal underworld in the prostheses business (\"Texhnolyze\"); the Salvation Union, a fanatical populist group interfering with the Organo's affairs; and the Racan, a marauding group of Texhnolyzed youths. The series has an ensemble cast, but events particularly focus on Ichise, a stoic [[prize fighter]] who loses a leg and an arm to satisfy an enraged promoter; Onishi, a young but level-headed executive of the Organo who has many enemies; and Ran, a little girl who has a very important gift that affects the entire city. As they struggle to accept the challenges that they are dealt, the characters bear witness to major events that determine the survival and fate of the city.\n\n''Texhnolyze'' aired on [[Fuji Television]] from April 16, 2003 to September 24, 2003 and aired twenty episodes. Two un-aired episodes were included in the DVD release. [[Geneon USA]]'s English dub of the series aired in the United States on [[STARZ!]]'s [[Starz Encore|Encore Action]] channel in 2006, then aired again on [[Toku (TV network)|FUNimation Channel]] and FUNimation Channel on Demand when [[FUNimation Entertainment]] licensed the series from Geneon Entertainment. It also aired in Canada on [[G4techTV Canada]]'s [[Anime Current]] block in the mid-2000s.\n\nJapanese [[visual kei]] singer [[Gackt]]'s song ''[[Tsuki no Uta]]'' was selected as its ending theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcuni.co.jp/rondorobe/anime/TEXHNOLYZE/note/item_cd02.html|title=TEXHNOLYZE|publisher=Rondo Robe|accessdate=2019-02-02|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a man-made underground society, descendants of a banished generation live for control of the crumbling city of Lux.

Upon arrival, Onishi meets with the sage, who proclaims that Lux inevitably will first be destroyed and then be reborn. Ishimori tells Ichise that he does not necessarily have to be part of the Organo. Onishi, seeking advice, is brought in to speak with Ran, who predicts that he is in danger of being destroyed by the loss of his real legs, but she passes out before foretelling the overwhelming future of the city. Michiko tells Onishi that Ichise found an assassin in a nearby factory, which somehow supplies armed weapons. The assassin in the factory attacks Ichise, but Ishimori shoots him down. It is unveiled that Onishi sold his real legs as a child to a disabled boy as an act of kindness. Ishimori betrays the group and attempts to kill Onishi, but Ichise uses his texhnolyzed arm to shield Onishi, who then shoots Ishimori in the shoulder. Onishi is taken by surprise when the sage shows up with his tribe and breaks his ties with the Organo, and Ichise is distraught when Ran says that he will be the one to destroy everything.\n}} \n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 14\n| Title           = REJECTION\n| DirectedBy      = Hong Hun-pyo\n| WrittenBy       = Shin Yoshida\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2003|7|30}}<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u7b2c14\u56de\u3000ROGUE 14\u3000REJECTION |url=https://www.fujitv.co.jp/b_hp/texhno/backnumber/403000009-14.html |publisher=[[Fuji TV]] |accessdate=January 5, 2020 |language=ja}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Doc goes to a mine that stores heaps of old texhnolyzed limbs for sale, but when she enters a shop for possible leads, she is harassed by the shop owner. Later, Onishi sends Ichise to see Doc at the research laboratory to fix his hand. Doc, having Ichise in tow, drives to her home outside the city limits, as she wants him to learn how to be sophisticated rather than violent. Upon arriving at the [[enclave]] of the Class at the end of a tunnel, Doc demands her leader to let her in so she can use her expertise in texhnolyzation, showing a [[magneto-optical disc]] which documented her research on Ichise. However, the only response she receives is a floating golden sphere which shoots laser beams at her, prompting Ichise to rescue her. Ultimately, her car is destroyed and her magneto-optical disc is shattered, as she and Ichise are forced to flee from the tunnel.

After witnessing this event, Tsujinaka and Toyama wonder why there have been murders occurring recently within the Organo. Yoko goes out with Hal at the bar, but she is reluctant to see Shinji spending time with Michiko there. When Hal questions why Shinji is so special to her, Yoko leaves him. Onishi sends Ichise with Kohakura and Sonoda to visit Goto in the hospital, but they are ambushed by more of Tsujinaka's men. Kohakura and Sonoda kill all the men, escaping to an abandoned building, but the tables have turned when Kohakura shoots Sonoda in the head.

Onishi, upset that Doc had disappeared on him, lets her know that he encountered Kano, but without seeing his face. Doc says that the Class plans to get rid of her ideas of texhnolyzation to allow Kano to begin his revolution upon the city. In the hospital, Ichise visits Goto, who tells him to shape his own future rather than depending on the future that Ran has foretold. Kohakura declares the Organo to be disbanded during an executive board meeting, but Onishi convinces some of the members to go against the decision. The Shapes infiltrate the hospital and attack Ichise, who tries to protect Goto from harm. When Ichise and Goto become surrounded, Onishi and his followers come to their rescue and mercilessly shoot the Shapes down.

Ran takes a train to Lux for unknown reasons. Kano captures Kohakura and forces him to be one of the Shapes. Kimata, exposing his texhnolyzed arm to his fellow men, prepares them for the battle against the Shapes. Ichise goes to retrieve Doc, where she reveals that she lied about having stored his mother's raffia inside his texhnolyzed limbs, having done so to help him accept being texhnolyzed. Ichise is greatly angered by this and nearly kills Doc in a fit of rage but manages to stop himself.

Doc, trying to persuade Ichise that the world is coming to an end, embraces him and tells him that they must leave Lux before it is too late. Onishi drives to the fortress of the Class, dodging obstacles along the way, and rendezvouses with Shinji there. The two are allowed inside the fortress, where they meet three grandmothers, who warn them that they need to stop Kano while they still have a chance.

They engage in a sword fight, which ends with Ichise beheading Toyama, who thanks Ichise for giving him a good fight just before he dies. Saginuma, showing his true form, later tells Ichise that the surface world is home to the theonormal, the remaining citizens who have resigned themselves to extinction. With the staircase shattered between the surface world and the underground city, Saginuma offers Ichise a chance to stay.

Shinji enters the fortress of the Class, killing many of the members before being shot himself by Zashi, Kano's informant, who then shoots himself in the head. Ran has displayed her visions to the people of Lux, which drive them mad. The obelisk, in the voice of Ran, speaks to Onishi, who is nearly driven to insanity, as the people have come to kill him. However, when he asks for her guidance, she suggests that he must kill her in order to stop living on with madness in body and soul.

An enraged Ichise begins to beat the people to a bloody pulp, even when his texhnolyzed limbs seem to function without the source of the obelisk. All the Shapes have rooted to the ground and permanently immobilized, including Kohakura. At an abandoned [[opera house]], Ichise finds Kano, who has failed in his attempt to use texhnolyzation to get people to evolve out of their violent ways, and now humanity's self-preserving bloodline has returned to its roots. Kano unveils that Ran, who has been turned into one of the Shapes, turned her mind off by her own will. Ichise begins to lose control at the sight of Ran. Kano warns that if he, the only sane person left, is killed, Ichise will be left to embrace his own madness, which then leads Ichise to punch Kano's head off in response. Ichise drops Ran's remains into the pool of raffia. He leans against a column, watching a projection of a simplistic rendering of one of Ran's flowers. Eventually, he slumps over and smiles as he and the city fade away.\n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Texhnolyze}}\n* {{ann|anime|2304}}\n* {{IMDb title|0409630}}\n* {{tv.com show|texhnolyze|Texhnolyze}}\n* [https://myanimelist.net/anime/26/Texhnolyze Texhnolyze] on [[MyAnimeList]]\n* ANN\n** [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/texhnolyze/dvd-1 Review of disk 1]\n** [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/texhnolyze/dvd-complete-series-anime-classics Series review]\n\n{{Madhouse}}\n\n[[Category:2003 anime television series]]\n[[Category:Anime with original screenplays]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:Geneon USA]]\n[[Category:Madhouse (company)]]\n[[Category:NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]]\n[[Category:Psychological anime and manga]]\n", "name_user": "Speedchariot", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texhnolyze"}
