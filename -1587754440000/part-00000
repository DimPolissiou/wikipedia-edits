In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]].

The first is as the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> The [[verb phrase]] can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the [[simple present]] or the [[simple past]]. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, [[noun phrase|noun phrases]] are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nBoth direct and indirect quotations in spoken discourse are not intended to be [[verbatim]] reproductions of an utterance that has been produced. Instead, direct quotations convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a direct quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref> Indirect quotations are simply paraphrases of something that a reporting speaker heard.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua|Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker usually appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare the following languages:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn American English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"adfoolen\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in other [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English as well (e.g. ''be like'' in New Zealand English,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Brian |title=\"All us girls were like euuh!\": Conversational work of be like in New Zealand adolescent talk |journal=New Zealand English Journal |date=2010 |volume=24 |pages=17\u201336 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249335742_All_us_girls_were_like_euuh_Conversational_work_of_be_like_in_New_Zealand_adolescent_talk |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> ''be like'' and ''go'' in [[Glasgow]] English<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>).<ref name=\"frederica\"/><ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117\u2013128}}</ref> Though not semantically considered verbs of saying, they are used to convey the same meaning as such verbs.

She '''went''' \"Who are you going with?\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n:: d. He''''s all''' \"Okay, come with me come with me\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\nIn conversational speech, the use of ''say'' and ''be like'' occurs at about the same frequency,<ref name=\"frederica\"/> though ''say'' tends to be used in more formal contexts (e.g. office hours between professors and students) and ''be like'' tends to occur in more informal contexts (e.g. a conversation between two young people).<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\n=====Japanese=====\n\nIn Japanese, the quotative particle ''to'' along with the verb of saying ''iu'' (say) occur after the quotation; the conjugated form of ''iu'' (say) is ''itta'':<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker ACC=Accusative COM=Complementizer HON=Honorific/Polite form\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u592a\u90ce || \u306f || \u6674\u6d77\u3000|| \u3092 || \u618e\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n|-\n| Taro || wa || Harumi || o || nikundeiru || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Taro || TOP || Harumi || ACC || hated || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''Taro said that he hated Harumi.''\" lit. \"''that 'I hated Harumi'''\"\n|}\n\nThe quotative particle ''to'' can also occur with verbs of thinking, such as ''omou'' (think). Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n=====Laal=====\n\nIn [[Laal language|Laal]], the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' is used for non-self quotation<ref name=\"laal\"/> (i.e. quotation in which the speaker quotes someone else, not themself); it is used with a quotative verb ''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''. The use of ''m\u0268\u0301'' results in an indirect quotation translation. The quotative verb ''b\u0268\u0301l\u00e1'' occurs before the quotation, while the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' occurs within the quoted speech ''j\u00e1 m\u0268\u0301 ny\u00e0g t\u0101\u0101 w\u00f3'':\n\nGloss: QEV=Quotative Evidential NEG=Negation\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u00e0<sub>i</sub> || '''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''' || m\u0268\u0301\u3000|| j\u00e1<sub>*i/j</sub> || '''m\u0268\u0301''' || ny\u00e0g || t\u0101\u0101 || w\u00f3 <ref name=\"laal\"/>\n|-\n| He || '''say''' || (say)that || I || '''QEV''' || eat || fish || NEG\n|-\n| colspan=8|\"''He<sub>i</sub> said that I<sub>*i/j</sub> don't/didn't eat fish.''\"\n|}\n\nAs the above sentence involves a non-self quotation, ''\u00e0'' (he) and ''j\u00e1'' (I) have different indices to show that they refer to different [[referent|referents]]; only this interpretation is [[well-formedness|well-formed]]. The interpretation in which they share identical indices is ill-formed (i.e. ungrammatical), as indicated by the asterisk.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation. It differs from the English structures in that it uses an overt quantifier ''zoiets'' to be [[grammaticality|well-formed]].<ref name=\"haddican et al\">{{cite journal |last1=Haddican |first1=William |last2=Zweig |first2=Eytan |last3=Johnson |first3=Daniel Ezra |title=The syntax of be like quotatives |journal=Proceedings of the 29th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics |date=2012 |page=81-89 |url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/29/paper2690.pdf}}</ref>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways: through grammatical marking, additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or systematic affixes of verbs. Quotative readings of evidentials are typologically rare. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows  the source of the quotation is from elsewhere, but this is not a quotative reading as there is no direct performative quoting or verbs of saying. Languages including Cusco Quechua, Kham, Tagalog, and Kaalallisut are documented as containing quotative evidentials.

In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]].

The first is as the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> The [[verb phrase]] can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the [[simple present]] or the [[simple past]]. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, [[noun phrase|noun phrases]] are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nBoth direct and indirect quotations in spoken discourse are not intended to be [[verbatim]] reproductions of an utterance that has been produced. Instead, direct quotations convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a direct quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref> Indirect quotations are simply paraphrases of something that a reporting speaker heard.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua|Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker usually appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare the following languages:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

He''''s all''' \"Okay, come with me come with me\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\nIn conversational speech, the use of ''say'' and ''be like'' occurs at about the same frequency,<ref name=\"frederica\"/> though ''say'' tends to be used in more formal contexts (e.g. office hours between professors and students) and ''be like'' tends to occur in more informal contexts (e.g. a conversation between two young people).<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\n=====Japanese=====\n\nIn Japanese, the quotative particle ''to'' along with the verb of saying ''iu'' (say) occur after the quotation; the conjugated form of ''iu'' (say) is ''itta'':<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker ACC=Accusative COM=Complementizer HON=Honorific/Polite form\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u592a\u90ce || \u306f || \u6674\u6d77\u3000|| \u3092 || \u618e\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n|-\n| Taro || wa || Harumi || o || nikundeiru || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Taro || TOP || Harumi || ACC || hated || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''Taro said that he hated Harumi.''\" lit. \"''that 'I hated Harumi'''\"\n|}\n\nThe quotative particle ''to'' can also occur with verbs of thinking, such as ''omou'' (think). Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n=====Laal=====\n\nIn [[Laal language|Laal]], the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' is used for non-self quotation<ref name=\"laal\"/> (i.e. quotation in which the speaker quotes someone else, not themself); it is used with a quotative verb ''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''. The use of ''m\u0268\u0301'' results in an indirect quotation translation. The quotative verb ''b\u0268\u0301l\u00e1'' occurs before the quotation, while the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' occurs within the quoted speech ''j\u00e1 m\u0268\u0301 ny\u00e0g t\u0101\u0101 w\u00f3'':\n\nGloss: QEV=Quotative Evidential NEG=Negation\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u00e0<sub>i</sub> || '''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''' || m\u0268\u0301\u3000|| j\u00e1<sub>*i/j</sub> || '''m\u0268\u0301''' || ny\u00e0g || t\u0101\u0101 || w\u00f3 <ref name=\"laal\"/>\n|-\n| He || '''say''' || (say)that || I || '''QEV''' || eat || fish || NEG\n|-\n| colspan=8|\"''He<sub>i</sub> said that I<sub>*i/j</sub> don't/didn't eat fish.''\"\n|}\n\nAs the above sentence involves a non-self quotation, ''\u00e0'' (he) and ''j\u00e1'' (I) have different indices to show that they refer to different [[referent|referents]]; only this interpretation is [[well-formedness|well-formed]]. The interpretation in which they share identical indices is ill-formed (i.e. ungrammatical), as indicated by the asterisk.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation.

Languages indicate this in various ways: through grammatical marking, additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or systematic affixes of verbs. Quotative readings of evidentials are typologically rare. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows  the source of the quotation is from elsewhere, but this is not a quotative reading as there is no direct performative quoting or verbs of saying. Languages including Cusco Quechua, Kham, Tagalog, and Kaalallisut are documented as containing quotative evidentials.

It is literally hell, do not come here.\n\n==Geography==\nEast Providence is located between the [[Providence River|Providence]] and [[Seekonk River|Seekonk]] Rivers on the west and the [[Seekonk, Massachusetts|Seekonk]] area of [[Massachusetts]] on the east. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|16.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|13.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|3.2|sqmi|km2}} of it (19.33%) is water.\n\nThe following villages are located in East Providence:<ref>[http://www.edc.uri.edu/rigis-spf/Statewide/state.html#boundaries RIGIS Villages data layer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509141349/http://www.edc.uri.edu/rigis-spf/Statewide/state.html |date=2006-05-09 }}</ref>\n* '''East Providence Center'''\n* [[Riverside, Rhode Island|Riverside]]\n* [[Rumford, Rhode Island|Rumford]]\n\nThe mayor is Roberto \"Bob\" DaSilva.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1641, the [[Plymouth Colony]] purchased from the Indians a large tract of land which today includes the northern half of East Providence (from Watchemoket to Rumford), [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]], [[Seekonk, Massachusetts]], and part of [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]]. Four years later, John Brown of Plymouth bought a considerably smaller piece of land from the Indians, which today comprises the southern part of East Providence (Riverside), Barrington, and a small part of Swansea. Finally, in 1661, Plymouth completed the \"North Purchase\" from which Attleboro, North Attleboro, and Cumberland were later formed. Over the whole the authorities gave the name 'Rehoboth'. The center of this large settlement, which is sometimes referred to as 'Old Rehoboth', is within the borders of modern East Providence. In 1812, the western half of Old Rehoboth was set off as a separate township called Seekonk, Massachusetts. Old Rehoboth's town center now became the heart of Old Seekonk. Finally, in 1862, the western part of Old Seekonk was ceded to Rhode Island and incorporated as East Providence.\n\n===Portuguese immigration===\n[[File:Phillips Street Restaurant, East Providence, Rhode Island.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|A Portuguese restaurant in East Providence]]\nBeginning around 1900 and continuing until the onset of the Depression in 1930, large numbers of Portuguese from Providence, Fall River, New Bedford, and Portugal settled in East Providence. By 1905, there were over 400 Portuguese in the town, the third-highest in the state. The Portuguese, like other ethnic groups, were drawn to East Providence primarily by the lure of jobs. Many employment opportunities were available in the Watchemoket area, where numerous immigrants settled.\n\n===Watchemoket Square===\n[[File:Former Industrial National Bank building at Watchemoket Square.jpg|thumb|right|Former Industrial National Bank building at Watchemoket Square]]\n[[File:Oddfellows' Hall, East Providence, RI 2012.jpg|thumb|right|[[Oddfellows' Hall (East Providence, Rhode Island)|Oddfellows Hall]] in Watchemoket Square]]\nIn decades preceding the Civil War, Watchemoket Point was little more than a farming and fishing area with perhaps a few hundred residents. Watchemoket was situated directly across from the thriving city of Providence and thus benefited from the expansion of that community. More importantly, two bridges across the Seekonk River gave easy access to Watchmemoket. By the 1860s, tolls were no longer being charged to cross the Washington and Central Bridges, giving further stimulus to the growth of Watchemoket and the transformation of the village from a sleepy fishing area to the vital core of East Providence in 1862. Perhaps the first businesses to come to Watchemoket were inns built to service the large numbers of people coming through. The residents of Watchemoket also had their own library by the early 1870s. At first the organizers named it Ladies Library Association, but in 1885 they changed the named to Watchemoket Free Public Library. Already the commercial and population center of East Providence, by the mid-1880s, Watchemoket next became the political center as well. The town hall was moved from Rumford to the heart of the community, so it was more accessible. They purchased a lot on Taunton Avenue for $11,500 and erected a two-story brick building which opened in 1889. That same year the East Providence Police Department opened its headquarters in the town hall.\n\nBy 1922, Watchemoket Square was the heart of downtown East Providence, supporting over 100 businesses including two department stores, two restaurants, five barber shops, bakeries, and blacksmith shops.<ref name=\"FRH2008\">{{cite news |last1=O'Connor |first1=Kevin P. |title=A place that may regain its glory |url=https://www.heraldnews.com/article/20081127/NEWS/311279604?template=ampart |accessdate=29 June 2019 |agency=Gatehosue Media |publisher=The Herald News |date=27 November 2008 |location=Fall River, Massachusetts}}</ref> Ingraham Hall was village's centerpiece, featuring a concert hall on the second floor and shopping on the first.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" /> [[Buffalo Bill#Buffalo Bill's Wild West|Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show]] performed at Ingraham Hall when it came to Rhode Island.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" /> An Industrial National Bank branch opened in 1923 with much publicity.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" /> Piers lined [[Narragansett Bay]]; in 1880, 473 ships docked at Watchemoket unloading 256,000 tons of coal.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" />\n\nHowever, the neighborhood began a decline when the [[Washington Bridge (Providence, Rhode Island)|Washington Bridge]] drew traffic south of the area in 1927.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" />  Then the [[1938 New England hurricane|Hurricane of 1938]] demolished the local [[oyster]] population.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" /> In 1955 [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] was built through the heart of Watchemoket, resulting in the northern half of the square to be demolished.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" /> Buildings which remain include the bank (now a comedy club), [[St. Mary's Episcopal Church (East Providence, Rhode Island)|St. Mary's Episcopal Church]], and [[Oddfellows' Hall (East Providence, Rhode Island)|Oddfellows' Hall]].\n\n===Rumford===\n{{see also|Rumford, Rhode Island}}\nFor some time after the incorporation of the town in 1862, the area around the old \"Ring of the Green\" was referred to as East Providence Center. The official town hall was located here until 1889, as were several churches. Moreover, the village was the population center of East Providence, containing many farms and mills along the Ten Mile River. Many people migrated from East Providence Center to the new center at Watchemoket.\n\n===Riverside===\n{{see also|Riverside, Rhode Island}}\n[[File:Old Colony Riverside train station.jpg|thumb|right|The old Riverside station on the [[East Bay Bike Path]]]]\nFrom the time of the Wannamoisett purchase in 1645 to the Civil War, the shore land from Watchemoket to Bullocks Point had remained a sparsely settled fishing and farming area. When East Providence was incorporated, no more than a few hundred of its residents made the coastal village their home. The white settlers had first learned of the plentiful supply of shellfish in the area from the Wampanoag Indians. More than two centuries later, the waters of Narragansett Bay, which washed the shores of Wannamoisett, still contained an abundant supply of edible sea treasures. Clams, quahogs, and oysters were harvested by Wannamoisett residents and sold in Providence. Arnold Medberry, for instance, brought his plow to the shoreline and began picking up clams by the handful. He loaded the shellfish on a cart and easily sold his entire day's catch in Providence. At that time, Medberry and his neighbors were referred to as \"clamdiggers\", a derogatory term comparable to the pejorative hayseed.\n\nAlready, by the early nineteenth century, individuals had begun to build summer homes, causing the population to double to about 500\u2013600. During that time period, Cedar Grove, Lewis Station, Chimney Corners, Peck's Corner, Pleasant Bluffs, Sabin's Point, Sherman's Station, and Pomham were developed. New resort facilities were built, such as the Pomham House. Numbers of roads were lined with trees and houses, Christian churches were formed, a library was built, and the Narragansett Engine Company was formed in 1878. By that time, the residents were no longer dismissed as \"clamdiggers\", but regarded as townspeople.\n[[File:Looff family at Crescent Park mgr c.1905-1910.jpg|thumb|right|Charles Looff and family at the [[Crescent Park Looff Carousel]], c. 1905]]\nWhile many transactions were taking place, [[Charles I. D. Looff]] came to Riverside. He was a wood carver for a furniture business in New York, and spent spare time in his basement carving wooden horses as a hobby. After long years of hard work, he produced the first steam-powered carousel and sold it to [[Crescent Park (defunct amusement park)|Crescent Park]]. He operated the carousel and designed a summer recreation area. By the early 1900s, New Englanders recognized Crescent Park as the leading amusement park in the region. Looff accomplished fantastic achievements and, after his death, his family continued to operate Crescent Park. The park closed in the 1970s and the land was used for condominiums. The [[Crescent Park Looff Carousel]] still remains.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Seal of East Providence, Rhode Island.jpg|thumb|right|Seal of East Providence]]\n[[File:East Providence City Hall, Rhode Island.jpg|thumb|right|City Hall]]\nThe City of East Providence is governed by an elected mayor and a five-member city council, with the mayor and counselors elected every four years. City council members are elected one each from four wards and one elected at-large.\n\n===Executive branch===\nThe mayor is both the ceremonial leader of the city and the chief executive officer. The mayor runs the daily operations of the city, enforces the charter and ordinances of the city and appoints all department heads except the city clerk. The current mayor of East Providence is [[Roberto DaSilva]], who took office on January 9, 2019.\n\nUp until January 9, 2019, the day-to-day operations were managed by a professional city manager appointed by the city council, and the mayor was the president of the city council, acting ceremonially.\n\n===Legislative branch===\nThe city council sets all city ordinances, sets the budget of the city (with recommendation from the mayor) and provides legislative oversight for city operations.\n\nThe city council elects a council president and council vice-president to preside over meetings. The city council also appoints the city clerk.\n\nUp until 2019, The city council served two-year terms, and the city council oversaw the entire city government under a council-manager system.\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the members of the East Providence City Council are:\n* Robert Rodericks\u2014At-Large (council vice-president)\n* Robert Britto\u2014Ward 1 (council president)\n* Anna Sousa\u2014Ward 2\n* Nathan Cahoon\u2014Ward 3\n* Ricardo Mourato\u2014Ward 4\n\n===Judicial branch===\nThe City of East Providence has a municipal court, which hears cases regarding violations of municipal ordinances, housing code violations and minor traffic violations. The city also has a probate court, which handles estates, name changes, guardianships and related matters. Judges for both courts are appointed by the mayor with confirmation by the city council for a term of two years.\n\n===Education governance===\nThe city also has an elected school committee, elected for two year terms by the same ward system as the city council. The school committee has broad authority to manage the school system, including setting all school system policies, setting the school system budget (within the general appropriation by the city, state and federal government) as well as selecting and overseeing the Superintendent of Schools.\n\n===Other boards and commissions===\nThe city has an appointed library board of trustees which governs the city's library system and various other appointed governing and advisory boards and commissions.\n\n==Recent development==\nThe city has recently created a commission charged with facilitating the redevelopment of old industrial sites and brownfields along most of East Providence's 14-mile coastline on the [[Seekonk River]] as mixed use residential, commercial, and light industrial zones.<ref>[http://www.projo.com/ri/eastprovidence/content/projo_20060510_epdev10.17bca881.html East Providence | Rhode Island news | projo.com | The Providence Journal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.eastprovidencewaterfront.com/?id=26 East Providence Waterfront Commission<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[File:East Prov.

The population was 47,037 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], making it the fifth-largest city in the state.\n\n==Geography==\nEast Providence is located between the [[Providence River|Providence]] and [[Seekonk River|Seekonk]] Rivers on the west and the [[Seekonk, Massachusetts|Seekonk]] area of [[Massachusetts]] on the east. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|16.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|13.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|3.2|sqmi|km2}} of it (19.33%) is water.\n\nThe following villages are located in East Providence:<ref>[http://www.edc.uri.edu/rigis-spf/Statewide/state.html#boundaries RIGIS Villages data layer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509141349/http://www.edc.uri.edu/rigis-spf/Statewide/state.html |date=2006-05-09 }}</ref>\n* '''East Providence Center'''\n* [[Riverside, Rhode Island|Riverside]]\n* [[Rumford, Rhode Island|Rumford]]\n\nThe mayor is Roberto \"Bob\" DaSilva.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1641, the [[Plymouth Colony]] purchased from the Indians a large tract of land which today includes the northern half of East Providence (from Watchemoket to Rumford), [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]], [[Seekonk, Massachusetts]], and part of [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]]. Four years later, John Brown of Plymouth bought a considerably smaller piece of land from the Indians, which today comprises the southern part of East Providence (Riverside), Barrington, and a small part of Swansea. Finally, in 1661, Plymouth completed the \"North Purchase\" from which Attleboro, North Attleboro, and Cumberland were later formed. Over the whole the authorities gave the name 'Rehoboth'. The center of this large settlement, which is sometimes referred to as 'Old Rehoboth', is within the borders of modern East Providence. In 1812, the western half of Old Rehoboth was set off as a separate township called Seekonk, Massachusetts. Old Rehoboth's town center now became the heart of Old Seekonk. Finally, in 1862, the western part of Old Seekonk was ceded to Rhode Island and incorporated as East Providence.\n\n===Portuguese immigration===\n[[File:Phillips Street Restaurant, East Providence, Rhode Island.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|A Portuguese restaurant in East Providence]]\nBeginning around 1900 and continuing until the onset of the Depression in 1930, large numbers of Portuguese from Providence, Fall River, New Bedford, and Portugal settled in East Providence. By 1905, there were over 400 Portuguese in the town, the third-highest in the state. The Portuguese, like other ethnic groups, were drawn to East Providence primarily by the lure of jobs. Many employment opportunities were available in the Watchemoket area, where numerous immigrants settled.\n\n===Watchemoket Square===\n[[File:Former Industrial National Bank building at Watchemoket Square.jpg|thumb|right|Former Industrial National Bank building at Watchemoket Square]]\n[[File:Oddfellows' Hall, East Providence, RI 2012.jpg|thumb|right|[[Oddfellows' Hall (East Providence, Rhode Island)|Oddfellows Hall]] in Watchemoket Square]]\nIn decades preceding the Civil War, Watchemoket Point was little more than a farming and fishing area with perhaps a few hundred residents. Watchemoket was situated directly across from the thriving city of Providence and thus benefited from the expansion of that community. More importantly, two bridges across the Seekonk River gave easy access to Watchmemoket. By the 1860s, tolls were no longer being charged to cross the Washington and Central Bridges, giving further stimulus to the growth of Watchemoket and the transformation of the village from a sleepy fishing area to the vital core of East Providence in 1862. Perhaps the first businesses to come to Watchemoket were inns built to service the large numbers of people coming through. The residents of Watchemoket also had their own library by the early 1870s. At first the organizers named it Ladies Library Association, but in 1885 they changed the named to Watchemoket Free Public Library. Already the commercial and population center of East Providence, by the mid-1880s, Watchemoket next became the political center as well. The town hall was moved from Rumford to the heart of the community, so it was more accessible. They purchased a lot on Taunton Avenue for $11,500 and erected a two-story brick building which opened in 1889. That same year the East Providence Police Department opened its headquarters in the town hall.\n\nBy 1922, Watchemoket Square was the heart of downtown East Providence, supporting over 100 businesses including two department stores, two restaurants, five barber shops, bakeries, and blacksmith shops.<ref name=\"FRH2008\">{{cite news |last1=O'Connor |first1=Kevin P. |title=A place that may regain its glory |url=https://www.heraldnews.com/article/20081127/NEWS/311279604?template=ampart |accessdate=29 June 2019 |agency=Gatehosue Media |publisher=The Herald News |date=27 November 2008 |location=Fall River, Massachusetts}}</ref> Ingraham Hall was village's centerpiece, featuring a concert hall on the second floor and shopping on the first.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" /> [[Buffalo Bill#Buffalo Bill's Wild West|Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show]] performed at Ingraham Hall when it came to Rhode Island.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" /> An Industrial National Bank branch opened in 1923 with much publicity.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" /> Piers lined [[Narragansett Bay]]; in 1880, 473 ships docked at Watchemoket unloading 256,000 tons of coal.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" />\n\nHowever, the neighborhood began a decline when the [[Washington Bridge (Providence, Rhode Island)|Washington Bridge]] drew traffic south of the area in 1927.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" />  Then the [[1938 New England hurricane|Hurricane of 1938]] demolished the local [[oyster]] population.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" /> In 1955 [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] was built through the heart of Watchemoket, resulting in the northern half of the square to be demolished.<ref name=\"FRH2008\" /> Buildings which remain include the bank (now a comedy club), [[St. Mary's Episcopal Church (East Providence, Rhode Island)|St. Mary's Episcopal Church]], and [[Oddfellows' Hall (East Providence, Rhode Island)|Oddfellows' Hall]].\n\n===Rumford===\n{{see also|Rumford, Rhode Island}}\nFor some time after the incorporation of the town in 1862, the area around the old \"Ring of the Green\" was referred to as East Providence Center. The official town hall was located here until 1889, as were several churches. Moreover, the village was the population center of East Providence, containing many farms and mills along the Ten Mile River. Many people migrated from East Providence Center to the new center at Watchemoket.\n\n===Riverside===\n{{see also|Riverside, Rhode Island}}\n[[File:Old Colony Riverside train station.jpg|thumb|right|The old Riverside station on the [[East Bay Bike Path]]]]\nFrom the time of the Wannamoisett purchase in 1645 to the Civil War, the shore land from Watchemoket to Bullocks Point had remained a sparsely settled fishing and farming area. When East Providence was incorporated, no more than a few hundred of its residents made the coastal village their home. The white settlers had first learned of the plentiful supply of shellfish in the area from the Wampanoag Indians. More than two centuries later, the waters of Narragansett Bay, which washed the shores of Wannamoisett, still contained an abundant supply of edible sea treasures. Clams, quahogs, and oysters were harvested by Wannamoisett residents and sold in Providence. Arnold Medberry, for instance, brought his plow to the shoreline and began picking up clams by the handful. He loaded the shellfish on a cart and easily sold his entire day's catch in Providence. At that time, Medberry and his neighbors were referred to as \"clamdiggers\", a derogatory term comparable to the pejorative hayseed.\n\nAlready, by the early nineteenth century, individuals had begun to build summer homes, causing the population to double to about 500\u2013600. During that time period, Cedar Grove, Lewis Station, Chimney Corners, Peck's Corner, Pleasant Bluffs, Sabin's Point, Sherman's Station, and Pomham were developed. New resort facilities were built, such as the Pomham House. Numbers of roads were lined with trees and houses, Christian churches were formed, a library was built, and the Narragansett Engine Company was formed in 1878. By that time, the residents were no longer dismissed as \"clamdiggers\", but regarded as townspeople.\n[[File:Looff family at Crescent Park mgr c.1905-1910.jpg|thumb|right|Charles Looff and family at the [[Crescent Park Looff Carousel]], c. 1905]]\nWhile many transactions were taking place, [[Charles I. D. Looff]] came to Riverside. He was a wood carver for a furniture business in New York, and spent spare time in his basement carving wooden horses as a hobby. After long years of hard work, he produced the first steam-powered carousel and sold it to [[Crescent Park (defunct amusement park)|Crescent Park]]. He operated the carousel and designed a summer recreation area. By the early 1900s, New Englanders recognized Crescent Park as the leading amusement park in the region. Looff accomplished fantastic achievements and, after his death, his family continued to operate Crescent Park. The park closed in the 1970s and the land was used for condominiums. The [[Crescent Park Looff Carousel]] still remains.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Seal of East Providence, Rhode Island.jpg|thumb|right|Seal of East Providence]]\n[[File:East Providence City Hall, Rhode Island.jpg|thumb|right|City Hall]]\nThe City of East Providence is governed by an elected mayor and a five-member city council, with the mayor and counselors elected every four years. City council members are elected one each from four wards and one elected at-large.\n\n===Executive branch===\nThe mayor is both the ceremonial leader of the city and the chief executive officer. The mayor runs the daily operations of the city, enforces the charter and ordinances of the city and appoints all department heads except the city clerk. The current mayor of East Providence is [[Roberto DaSilva]], who took office on January 9, 2019.\n\nUp until January 9, 2019, the day-to-day operations were managed by a professional city manager appointed by the city council, and the mayor was the president of the city council, acting ceremonially.\n\n===Legislative branch===\nThe city council sets all city ordinances, sets the budget of the city (with recommendation from the mayor) and provides legislative oversight for city operations.\n\nThe city council elects a council president and council vice-president to preside over meetings. The city council also appoints the city clerk.\n\nUp until 2019, The city council served two-year terms, and the city council oversaw the entire city government under a council-manager system.\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the members of the East Providence City Council are:\n* Robert Rodericks\u2014At-Large (council vice-president)\n* Robert Britto\u2014Ward 1 (council president)\n* Anna Sousa\u2014Ward 2\n* Nathan Cahoon\u2014Ward 3\n* Ricardo Mourato\u2014Ward 4\n\n===Judicial branch===\nThe City of East Providence has a municipal court, which hears cases regarding violations of municipal ordinances, housing code violations and minor traffic violations. The city also has a probate court, which handles estates, name changes, guardianships and related matters. Judges for both courts are appointed by the mayor with confirmation by the city council for a term of two years.\n\n===Education governance===\nThe city also has an elected school committee, elected for two year terms by the same ward system as the city council. The school committee has broad authority to manage the school system, including setting all school system policies, setting the school system budget (within the general appropriation by the city, state and federal government) as well as selecting and overseeing the Superintendent of Schools.\n\n===Other boards and commissions===\nThe city has an appointed library board of trustees which governs the city's library system and various other appointed governing and advisory boards and commissions.\n\n==Recent development==\nThe city has recently created a commission charged with facilitating the redevelopment of old industrial sites and brownfields along most of East Providence's 14-mile coastline on the [[Seekonk River]] as mixed use residential, commercial, and light industrial zones.<ref>[http://www.projo.com/ri/eastprovidence/content/projo_20060510_epdev10.17bca881.html East Providence | Rhode Island news | projo.com | The Providence Journal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.eastprovidencewaterfront.com/?id=26 East Providence Waterfront Commission<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[File:East Prov.

Gauri however is still very immature and continues her playful acts like a little village belle. Ramesh travels to the village to prepare for the marriage and tries to woe Gauri without much success. He is however eyed by another village lady Padhi who dreams of using Ramesh as her ticket to the city. After the marriage, Ramesh is not able to consummate as Gauri runs away from him. This frustrates Ramesh and he walks out into the arms of waiting Padhi. They begin a lustrous affair and Ramesh ignores his wife completely. He even goes back to the city with Padhi without the knowledge of his family promising his wife to get her as soon as he finds a suitable home. Once back in the city, they start living as husband and wife. However, Padhi loses interest in Ramesh and eyes the men around. She falls into a trap by a man who is into prostitution selling women to far Mumbai. When Ramesh finds out about Padhi's treachery he is angry but feels helpless. He gets worried about his future when police start making enquiry about Padhi and the man with whom she was seen. Back in the village his aunt along with his wife travel to Bangalore when they find that their letters were unanswered. They cannot track him in spite of visiting his work place as he has resigned.

San Francisco was chosen as the location for the first Gay Games not only because it was the home of founder Tom Waddell, but also because the games had support from local government and essential services, and because there was a large gay and lesbian population in San Francisco that could serve as volunteers and leaders. The opening ceremonies, held in Kezar Stadium, began with former U.S. Olympians, George Frenn and Susan McGrievey lighting a flame that had been carried on a torch run across America, beginning in New York at the Stonewall Inn.<ref>{{Cite book|last=edited by Rita Liberti and Maureen M.

There were three main points of contention, over which neither party could agree:\n\n* The size of the event\n* The size of the budget{{spaced ndash}} especially the planned break-even participation point\n* Financial transparency\n\nIn a weakening global economy following international terrorist attacks, including the [[September 11 attacks]], the FGG wanted Montreal to be able to plan for a successful Gay Games even if participation did not meet Montreal's optimistic projection of 24,000 participants, twice the level of participation of the previous Gay Games in 2002. Due to financial problems in previous events, the FGG also asked for transparency into Montreal 2006's financial activities. After Montreal refused to continue talks, the FGG held a second round of bidding in which Chicago and Los Angeles bidders, who had put forth well-received bids to host the 2006 games in the first round along with Montreal and Atlanta, chose to bid. Ultimately, the FGG awarded Gay Games VII to Chicago Games, Inc.\n\nThe Montreal organizing committee nevertheless decided to proceed to hold an athletic and cultural event without the sanction of the FGG; this plan developed into the [[2006 World Outgames|first edition]] of the [[World Outgames]], and the creation of its licensing body, the [[Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association]].\n\nDue to limited personal and organizational resources, many individual and team participants were forced to choose between [[Gay Games VII|Gay Games Chicago]] and [[2006 World Outgames|World Outgames Montreal]], a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on July 22, 2006, was only seven days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on July 29, 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike.\n\nFew teams were able to field complete squads for both events. In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament.\nThere were some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise.  For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew 9,112 sport and cultural participants, of which 7,929 were from the USA.  Montreal drew 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games reflecting more than 111 countries{{spaced ndash}} more 60% of the organization's original projections.\"\n\nSince 2006, the need for a secondary global multisport event has been the subject of much debate, especially after the final financial figures for 2006 were released. In 2012, a round of negotiations between the FGG and GLISA ended after a mutually agreed deadline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glisa.org/glisa-fgg-agreement-not-reached/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122071856/http://www.glisa.org/glisa-fgg-agreement-not-reached/ |archivedate=November 22, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The board of GLISA unanimously agree to the proposal set forth by the negotiation teams, however the FGG board did not reciprocate.

In contrast, the Montreal World Outgames ended with $5.3 million (Canadian) of debt.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn addition, the lack of attendees and participants at both events resulted in GLISA (the organization which heads the Outgames) changing the years of the event to precede the years of the Gay Games, {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}meaning that the World Outgames were held in 2009 in Copenhagen and the Gay Games held in Cologne in 2010, while the World Outgames were held in 2013 in Antwerp and Gay Games were held in 2014 in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n=== Media impact of AIDS on the Gay Games ===\nBefore and during the time of the 1986 Gay Games there was mass media about Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]) and how it was affecting the gay community.<ref name=\":1\" /> With the number of [[LGBT]] members at the Gay Games the founder Waddell took this time try and break the stereotype of the AIDS with a show of athleticism the Gay Games had to offer.<ref name=\":0\" /> This also was a time that volunteers would provide safe sex materials along with condoms to educate the public.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|LGBT|Sports}}\n* [[EuroGames|EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)]]\n* [[International Gay and Lesbian Football Association]]\n* [[List of LGBT sportspeople]]\n* [[Principle 6 campaign]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130929011426/http://www.gg9cle.com/ Gay Games Cleveland/Akron 2014]\n* [http://www.gaygames.org/ Federation of Gay Games]\n* [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5868750,00.html Postcard from Europe: Questioning the necessity of the Gay Games]\n* [http://www.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00450.xml Minnesota lesbian/gay committee of the International Athletic Association archives]\n*  [http://www.vivomediaarts.com/archive/gay-games-iii/ Documentation of Celebration '90 Gay Games III held in Vancouver on VIVO Media Arts Centre's website]\n* [http://gaytodo.com/ Gay Ireland]\n\n{{Gay Games}}\n{{International multi-sport events}}\n\n[[Category:Gay Games]]\n[[Category:Quadrennial sporting events]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Multi-sport events]]\n[[Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1982]]\n[[Category:LGBT sports]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Gay Olympics|other events|Gay Olympics (disambiguation)}}\n{{Distinguish|Outgames}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2013}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[File:Gay Games 2006 End-Ceremony 03.jpg|thumb|300px|The Gay Games Closing Ceremony 2006 \u2013 Handing off the flag to the [[Cologne, Germany]] contingent, host of Gay Games 2010]]\nThe '''Gay Games''' is a worldwide sport and cultural event that promotes acceptance of [[sexual diversity]], featuring [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) athletes and artists.\n\nFounded as the '''Gay Olympics''', it was started in the United States in [[San Francisco, California]], in 1982, as the brainchild of Olympic decathlete (Mexico City 1968) and medical doctor [[Tom Waddell]], [[Rikki Streicher]],<ref>ROB MORSE, San Francisco Chronicle, Perspiration Condemnation for N.Y.

There were three main points of contention, over which neither party could agree:\n\n* The size of the event\n* The size of the budget{{spaced ndash}} especially the planned break-even participation point\n* Financial transparency\n\nIn a weakening global economy following international terrorist attacks, including the [[September 11 attacks]], the FGG wanted Montreal to be able to plan for a successful Gay Games even if participation did not meet Montreal's optimistic projection of 24,000 participants, twice the level of participation of the previous Gay Games in 2002. Due to financial problems in previous events, the FGG also asked for transparency into Montreal 2006's financial activities. After Montreal refused to continue talks, the FGG held a second round of bidding in which Chicago and Los Angeles bidders, who had put forth well-received bids to host the 2006 games in the first round along with Montreal and Atlanta, chose to bid. Ultimately, the FGG awarded Gay Games VII to Chicago Games, Inc.\n\nThe Montreal organizing committee nevertheless decided to proceed to hold an athletic and cultural event without the sanction of the FGG; this plan developed into the [[2006 World Outgames|first edition]] of the [[World Outgames]], and the creation of its licensing body, the [[Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association]].\n\nDue to limited personal and organizational resources, many individual and team participants were forced to choose between [[Gay Games VII|Gay Games Chicago]] and [[2006 World Outgames|World Outgames Montreal]], a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on July 22, 2006, was only seven days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on July 29, 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike.\n\nFew teams were able to field complete squads for both events. In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament.\nThere were some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise.  For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew 9,112 sport and cultural participants, of which 7,929 were from the USA.  Montreal drew 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games reflecting more than 111 countries{{spaced ndash}} more 60% of the organization's original projections.\"\n\nSince 2006, the need for a secondary global multisport event has been the subject of much debate, especially after the final financial figures for 2006 were released.

{"title_page": "Judicial independence", "text_new": "{{Short description|Notion that judges should not be beholden to political pressures}}'''Judicial independence''' is the concept that the [[judiciary]] should be independent from the other  [[Separation of powers|branches of government]]. That is, [[court]]s should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government or from private or partisan interests. Judicial independence is important to the idea of [[separation of powers]].\n\nMany countries deal with the idea of judicial independence through different means of judicial selection, or choosing [[judge]]s. One way to promote judicial independence is by granting [[life tenure]] or long tenure for judges, which ideally frees them to decide [[Legal case|cases]] and make [[Court order|rulings]] according to the [[rule of law]] and [[judicial discretion]], even if those decisions are politically unpopular or opposed by powerful interests. This concept can be traced back to 18th-century England.\n\nIn some countries, the ability of the judiciary to check the legislature is enhanced by the power of [[judicial review]]. This power can be used, for example, by mandating certain action when the judiciary perceives that a branch of government is refusing to perform a constitutional duty or by declaring laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional.\n\n==Theory of judicial independence==\n[[File:Hamilton small.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], by portraitist Daniel Huntington ''c.'' 1865. In ''[[Federalist No. 78|The Federalist No. 78]]'', published 28 May 1788, Hamilton wrote: \"The complete independence of the courts of justice is particularly essential in a limited constitution.\"]]\n\n===Importance===\nJudicial independence serves as a safeguard for the rights and privileges provided by a limited constitution and prevents [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature|legislative]] encroachment upon those rights.<ref>{{citation|author=Alexander Hamilton|authorlink=Alexander Hamilton|contribution=The Federalist No. 78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-7DDxR-3KQC&pg=PA524|editor=Jacob E.

Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.}}.</ref> It serves as a foundation for the [[rule of law]] and [[democracy]]. The rule of law means that all authority and power must come from an ultimate source of law. Under an independent judicial system, the courts and its officers are free from inappropriate intervention in the [[judiciary]]'s affairs. With this independence, the judiciary can safeguard people's rights and freedoms which ensure equal protection for all.<ref>{{citation|author=Li-ann Thio|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|chapter=Rule of Law within a Non-liberal 'Communitarian' Democracy: The Singapore Experience|editor=Randall Peerenboom|title=Asian Discourses of Rule of Law: Theories and Implementation of Rule of Law in Twelve Asian Countries, France and the U.S.|location=London; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Routledge|RoutledgeCurzon]]|year=2004|pages=183\u2013224 at 188|isbn=978-0-415-32613-1|quote=As the partisan administration of law erodes rule of law, a central institutional requirement is an independent, accessible judiciary.}}.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the law and the respect that people have for the law and the government which enacts it is dependent upon the judiciary's independence to mete out fair decisions. Furthermore, it is a pillar of economic growth as multinational businesses and investors have confidence to invest in the economy of a nation who has a strong and stable judiciary that is independent of interference.<ref>{{citation|author=Roger K.

Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any [[separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=2\u20133}} The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and inter-dependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=3\u20135}}\n\nAlso, an extremely independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, which is the duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or problems. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=4-5}}\n\n==Economic basis==\n[[Constitutional economics]] studies issues such as the proper distribution of national wealth including government spending on the judiciary. In transitional and developing countries, spending on the judiciary may be controlled by the executive. This undermines the principle of judicial independence because it creates a financial dependence of the judiciary on the executive. It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and privileges) being the most dangerous, and private. State corruption of the judiciary can impede the ability of businesses to optimally facilitate the growth and development of a [[market economy]].<ref>Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009</ref>\n\nIn some countries, the constitution also prohibits the legislative branch from reducing salaries of sitting judges.\n\n==Development of the concept==\n\n===National and international developments===\n\nThe development of judicial independence has been argued to involve a cycle of national law having an impact on international law, and international law subsequently impacting national law.<ref name=Shetreet2009>S Shetreet, \u2018The Normative Cycle of Shaping Judicial Independence in Domestic and International Law: The Mutual Impact of National and International Jurisprudence and Contemporary Practical and Conceptual Challenges\u2019 (2009) 10 Chicago Journal of International Law 275-332</ref> This is said to occur in three phases: the first phase is characterized by the domestic development of the concept of judicial independence, the second by the spread of these concepts internationally and their implementation in international law, and the third by the implementation in national law of these newly formulated international principles of judicial independence.<ref name=Shetreet2009/>\n\nA notable example illustrating this cycle is the United Kingdom. The first phase occurred in England with the original conception of judicial independence in the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].<ref>See generally Shimon Shetreet book, Judges on Trial.</ref> The second phase was evident when England's concepts regarding judicial independence spread internationally, and were adopted into the domestic law of other countries; for instance, England served as the model for [[Montesquieu]]\u2019s [[separation of powers]] doctrine,<ref>See Baron de Montesquieu, [[The Spirit of the Laws]] (Hafner 1949) (Thomas Nugent, trans).</ref> and the Founding Fathers of the [[US Constitution]] used England as their dominant model in formulating the Constitution's Article III, which is the foundation of American judicial independence.<ref>Article III of the US Constitution provides that \u201cthe judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\u201d</ref> Other [[common law]] countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, also adopted the British model of judicial independence.<ref>Shetreet, Judicial Independence. See also Peter H. Russell, The Judiciary in Canada: The Third Branch of Government (McGraw-Hill Ryerson 1987); John Bell, Judicial Cultures and Judicial Independence, 4 Cambridge YB Eur Legal Studies 47 (2001).</ref>\n\nIn recent decades the third phase of judicial independence has been evident in the UK,<ref>UK Human Rights Act - 1998</ref> as it has been significantly influenced by judicial independence principles developed by international human rights constitutional documents. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) has had a significant impact on the conceptual analysis of judicial independence in England and Scotland. This process began in the 1990s with the ECtHR hearing UK cases and, more significantly, in the application of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in British law through the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which came into force in the UK in 2000.<ref>Human Rights Act (1998), ch 42 (UK), available online at <{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901121920/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |archivedate=2010-09-01 }}> (visited Mar 27, 2009).</ref>\n\nWhere British national law had previously impacted the international development of judicial independence, the British [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]]<ref>Constitutional Reform Act (2005), ch 4 (UK). For a detailed analysis of the history of this act, see Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: The Politics of Constitutional Reform, 2006 Pub L 35; Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: Ministers, Judges and Constitutional Change, 2005 Pub L 806. For accounts of the main players, see Lord Woolf, The Pursuit of Justice 161\u201374 (Oxford 2008); Lord Phillips, Constitutional Reform: One Year On, The Judicial Studies Board Annual Lecture (Mar 22, 2007); Lord Woolf, The Rule of Law and a Change in the Constitution, 2004 Camb L J 317; Tom Bingham, The Business of Judging: Selected Essays and Speeches 55\u201368 (Oxford 2000). All three authors served as lord chief justice in these formative years. Lord Woolf was active in the shaping of the legislation and Lord Phillips succeeded him</ref> marked a shift, with international law now impacting British domestic law. The Constitutional Reform Act dramatically reformed government control over the administration of justice in England and Wales; importantly, it discontinued the position of the [[Lord Chancellor]], one of the country's oldest constitutional offices, who was entrusted with a combination of legislative, executive, and judicial capacities.<ref name=\"Anthony Seldon 2007\">Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294</ref> The Lord Chancellor served as speaker of the Upper House of Parliament, the [[House of Lords]]; as a member of the executive branch and member of the senior cabinet; and as the head of the judiciary. Historically, the appellate function had a connection with the executive branch due to the types of cases typically heard \u2013 [[Impeachment#United Kingdom|impeachment]] and the hearing of felony charges against peers.<ref>Robert Stevens, Law and Politics: The House of Lords as a Judicial Body, 1800-1976 (University of North Carolina Press, 1978), at 6</ref> The Constitutional Reform Act established new lines of demarcation between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary, transferring all the judicial functions to the judiciary and entrusting the Lord Chancellor only with what are considered administrative and executive matters. In addition, the Constitutional Reform Act replaced the Lord Chancellor by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] as head of the judiciary, separated the judicial [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] from the legislative parliament, reforming it as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], and creating a [[Judicial Appointments Commission]].<ref name=\"Anthony Seldon 2007\"/> The creation of the Supreme Court was important, for it finally separated the highest court of appeal from the House of Lords.<ref>Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 113</ref>\n\nThus, the United Kingdom, where judicial independence began over three hundred years ago, illustrates the interaction over time of national and international law and jurisprudence in the area of judicial independence. In this process, concepts and ideas have become enriched as they have been implemented in successive judicial and political systems, as each system has enhanced and deepened the concepts and ideas it actualized. In addition to the UK, similar developments of conceptual cross-fertilization can be seen internationally, for example in [[European Union law]],<ref>See Treaty on European Union, art F, 1992 OJ (C 191) 1 (Jul 29, 1992). Paragraph 2 of Article F states, \u201cThe Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . . . and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.\u201d</ref> in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries such as Austria, and in other common law jurisdictions including Canada.<ref>See, for example, Valente v The Queen, [1985] 2 SCR 673 (Canada)</ref>\n\n===International standards===\nThe [[International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace]] produced the Mt.

These built on the same association's New Delhi Minimum Standards on Judicial independence adopted in 1982 and their Montr\u00e9al Universal Declaration on the Independence of Justice in 1983.

These include rights to tenure (although the Constitution has since been amended to introduce mandatory retirement at age 75) and the right to a salary determined by the [[Parliament of Canada]] (as opposed to the executive). In 1982 a measure of judicial independence was extended to inferior courts specializing in [[criminal law]] (but not [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]) by [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], although in the 1986 case ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'' it was found these rights are limited. They do, however, involve tenure, financial security and some administrative control.\n\nThe year 1997 saw a major shift towards judicial independence, as the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the [[Provincial Judges Reference]] found an unwritten constitutional norm guaranteeing judicial independence to all judges, including civil law inferior court judges. The unwritten norm is said to be implied by the [[preamble]] to the Constitution Act, 1867. Consequently, judicial compensation committees such as the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]] now recommend judicial salaries in Canada.\nThere are two types of judicial independence: institutional independence and decisional independence. Institutional independence means the judicial branch is independent from the executive and legislative branches. Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.\n\n== Hong Kong ==\nIn [[Hong Kong]], independence of the judiciary has been the tradition since the territory became a British crown colony in 1842. After the 1997 transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the [[People's Republic of China]] pursuant to the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], an international treaty registered with the [[United Nations]], independence of the judiciary, along with continuation of English [[common law]], has been enshrined in the territory's constitutional document, the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]].<ref>[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html \"The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China\"- Chapter 1], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008.

To safeguard judicial independence, [[law of Singapore|Singapore law]] lays down special procedures to be followed before the conduct of [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] [[judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore#The Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal, and Judges and Judicial Commissioners of the High Court|judges]] may be discussed in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|State Courts]], and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases in which they are personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges.\n\nThe [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] and other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the [[President of Singapore]] acting on the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore]]. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet's advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy [[security of tenure]] up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n===England and Wales===\n{{main|Judiciary of England and Wales}}\n\n====History====\nDuring the [[middle ages]], under the Norman monarchy of the [[Kingdom of England]], the king and his [[Curia Regis]] held judicial power. Judicial independence began to emerge during the [[early modern period]]; more courts were created and a judicial profession grew. By the fifteenth century, the king's role in this feature of government became small.<ref>Justice [[Gerard La Forest]], [[Provincial Judges Reference]], [[Supreme Court of Canada]], para. 305.</ref> Nevertheless, kings could still influence courts and dismiss judges. The [[Stuart dynasty]] used this power frequently in order to overpower the [[Parliament of England]]. After the Stuarts were removed in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, some advocated guarding against royal manipulation of the judiciary. King [[William III of England|William III]] approved the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which established tenure for judges unless Parliament removed them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref><ref>Justice Gerard La Forest, Provincial Judges Reference, para. 306.</ref>\n\n====Contemporary usage====\nUnder the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], there are two important [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] which help to preserve judicial independence. The first is that the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] does not comment on the cases which are before the court. The second is the principle of [[parliamentary privilege]]: that [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] are protected from prosecution in certain circumstances by the courts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nFurthermore, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitutional reform|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/constitutional-reform/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> In order to try to promote the independence of the judiciary, the selection process is designed to minimize political interference. The process focuses on senior members of the judiciary rather than on politicians. Part 2 of the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] aims to increase [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among the judiciary.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe pay of judges is determined by an independent pay review body. It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence from a variety of sources. The government accepts these recommendations and will traditionally implement them fully. As long as judges hold their positions in \"good order,\" they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the [[mandatory retirement]] age of 70.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nUntil 1 January 2010, the legal profession was self-regulating; with responsibility for implementing and enforcing its own professional standards and disciplining its own members. The bodies which performed this function were the [[Bar Council]] and the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]]. However, this self-regulation came to an end when approved regulators came under the regulation of the [[Legal Services Board]], composed of non-lawyers, following the passage of the [[Legal Services Act 2007]].

That is, [[court]]s should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government or from private or partisan interests. Judicial independence is important to the idea of [[separation of powers]].\n\nMany Countries deal with the idea of judicial independence through different means of judicial selection, or choosing [[judge]]s. One way to promote judicial independence is by granting [[life tenure]] or long tenure for judges, which ideally frees them to decide [[Legal case|cases]] and make [[Court order|rulings]] according to the [[rule of law]] and [[judicial discretion]], even if those decisions are politically unpopular or opposed by powerful interests. This concept can be traced back to 18th-century England.\n\nIn some countries, the ability of the judiciary to check the legislature is enhanced by the power of [[judicial review]]. This power can be used, for example, by mandating certain action when the judiciary perceives that a branch of government is refusing to perform a constitutional duty or by declaring laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional.\n\n==Theory of judicial independence==\n[[File:Hamilton small.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], by portraitist Daniel Huntington ''c.'' 1865.

The rule of law means that all authority and power must come from an ultimate source of law.

Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any [[separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=2\u20133}} The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and inter-dependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=3\u20135}}\n\nAlso, an extremely independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, which is the duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or problems. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=4-5}}\n\n==Economic basis==\n[[Constitutional economics]] studies issues such as the proper distribution of national wealth including government spending on the judiciary. In transitional and developing countries, spending on the judiciary may be controlled by the executive. This undermines the principle of judicial independence because it creates a financial dependence of the judiciary on the executive. It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and privileges) being the most dangerous, and private. State corruption of the judiciary can impede the ability of businesses to optimally facilitate the growth and development of a [[market economy]].<ref>Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009</ref>\n\nIn some countries, the constitution also prohibits the legislative branch from reducing salaries of sitting judges.\n\n==Development of the concept==\n\n===National and international developments===\n\nThe development of judicial independence has been argued to involve a cycle of national law having an impact on international law, and international law subsequently impacting national law.<ref name=Shetreet2009>S Shetreet, \u2018The Normative Cycle of Shaping Judicial Independence in Domestic and International Law: The Mutual Impact of National and International Jurisprudence and Contemporary Practical and Conceptual Challenges\u2019 (2009) 10 Chicago Journal of International Law 275-332</ref> This is said to occur in three phases: the first phase is characterized by the domestic development of the concept of judicial independence, the second by the spread of these concepts internationally and their implementation in international law, and the third by the implementation in national law of these newly formulated international principles of judicial independence.<ref name=Shetreet2009/>\n\nA notable example illustrating this cycle is the United Kingdom. The first phase occurred in England with the original conception of judicial independence in the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].<ref>See generally Shimon Shetreet book, Judges on Trial.</ref> The second phase was evident when England's concepts regarding judicial independence spread internationally, and were adopted into the domestic law of other countries; for instance, England served as the model for [[Montesquieu]]\u2019s [[separation of powers]] doctrine,<ref>See Baron de Montesquieu, [[The Spirit of the Laws]] (Hafner 1949) (Thomas Nugent, trans).</ref> and the Founding Fathers of the [[US Constitution]] used England as their dominant model in formulating the Constitution's Article III, which is the foundation of American judicial independence.<ref>Article III of the US Constitution provides that \u201cthe judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\u201d</ref> Other [[common law]] countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, also adopted the British model of judicial independence.<ref>Shetreet, Judicial Independence.

Russell, The Judiciary in Canada: The Third Branch of Government (McGraw-Hill Ryerson 1987); John Bell, Judicial Cultures and Judicial Independence, 4 Cambridge YB Eur Legal Studies 47 (2001).</ref>\n\nIn recent decades the third phase of judicial independence has been evident in the UK,<ref>UK Human Rights Act - 1998</ref> as it has been significantly influenced by judicial independence principles developed by international human rights constitutional documents. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) has had a significant impact on the conceptual analysis of judicial independence in England and Scotland. This process began in the 1990s with the ECtHR hearing UK cases and, more significantly, in the application of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in British law through the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which came into force in the UK in 2000.<ref>Human Rights Act (1998), ch 42 (UK), available online at <{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901121920/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |archivedate=2010-09-01 }}> (visited Mar 27, 2009).</ref>\n\nWhere British national law had previously impacted the international development of judicial independence, the British [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]]<ref>Constitutional Reform Act (2005), ch 4 (UK). For a detailed analysis of the history of this act, see Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: The Politics of Constitutional Reform, 2006 Pub L 35; Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: Ministers, Judges and Constitutional Change, 2005 Pub L 806. For accounts of the main players, see Lord Woolf, The Pursuit of Justice 161\u201374 (Oxford 2008); Lord Phillips, Constitutional Reform: One Year On, The Judicial Studies Board Annual Lecture (Mar 22, 2007); Lord Woolf, The Rule of Law and a Change in the Constitution, 2004 Camb L J 317; Tom Bingham, The Business of Judging: Selected Essays and Speeches 55\u201368 (Oxford 2000). All three authors served as lord chief justice in these formative years. Lord Woolf was active in the shaping of the legislation and Lord Phillips succeeded him</ref> marked a shift, with international law now impacting British domestic law. The Constitutional Reform Act dramatically reformed government control over the administration of justice in England and Wales; importantly, it discontinued the position of the [[Lord Chancellor]], one of the country's oldest constitutional offices, who was entrusted with a combination of legislative, executive, and judicial capacities.<ref name=\"Anthony Seldon 2007\">Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294</ref> The Lord Chancellor served as speaker of the Upper House of Parliament, the [[House of Lords]]; as a member of the executive branch and member of the senior cabinet; and as the head of the judiciary. Historically, the appellate function had a connection with the executive branch due to the types of cases typically heard \u2013 [[Impeachment#United Kingdom|impeachment]] and the hearing of felony charges against peers.<ref>Robert Stevens, Law and Politics: The House of Lords as a Judicial Body, 1800-1976 (University of North Carolina Press, 1978), at 6</ref> The Constitutional Reform Act established new lines of demarcation between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary, transferring all the judicial functions to the judiciary and entrusting the Lord Chancellor only with what are considered administrative and executive matters. In addition, the Constitutional Reform Act replaced the Lord Chancellor by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] as head of the judiciary, separated the judicial [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] from the legislative parliament, reforming it as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], and creating a [[Judicial Appointments Commission]].<ref name=\"Anthony Seldon 2007\"/> The creation of the Supreme Court was important, for it finally separated the highest court of appeal from the House of Lords.<ref>Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 113</ref>\n\nThus, the United Kingdom, where judicial independence began over three hundred years ago, illustrates the interaction over time of national and international law and jurisprudence in the area of judicial independence. In this process, concepts and ideas have become enriched as they have been implemented in successive judicial and political systems, as each system has enhanced and deepened the concepts and ideas it actualized. In addition to the UK, similar developments of conceptual cross-fertilization can be seen internationally, for example in [[European Union law]],<ref>See Treaty on European Union, art F, 1992 OJ (C 191) 1 (Jul 29, 1992). Paragraph 2 of Article F states, \u201cThe Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . . . and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.\u201d</ref> in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries such as Austria, and in other common law jurisdictions including Canada.<ref>See, for example, Valente v The Queen, [1985] 2 SCR 673 (Canada)</ref>\n\n===International standards===\nThe [[International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace]] produced the Mt.

These include rights to tenure (although the Constitution has since been amended to introduce mandatory retirement at age 75) and the right to a salary determined by the [[Parliament of Canada]] (as opposed to the executive). In 1982 a measure of judicial independence was extended to inferior courts specializing in [[criminal law]] (but not [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]) by [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], although in the 1986 case ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'' it was found these rights are limited. They do, however, involve tenure, financial security and some administrative control.\n\nThe year 1997 saw a major shift towards judicial independence, as the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the [[Provincial Judges Reference]] found an unwritten constitutional norm guaranteeing judicial independence to all judges, including civil law inferior court judges. The unwritten norm is said to be implied by the [[preamble]] to the Constitution Act, 1867. Consequently, judicial compensation committees such as the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]] now recommend judicial salaries in Canada.\nThere are two types of judicial independence: institutional independence and decisional independence. Institutional independence means the judicial branch is independent from the executive and legislative branches. Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.\n\n== Hong Kong ==\nIn [[Hong Kong]], independence of the judiciary has been the tradition since the territory became a British crown colony in 1842. After the 1997 transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the [[People's Republic of China]] pursuant to the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], an international treaty registered with the [[United Nations]], independence of the judiciary, along with continuation of English [[common law]], has been enshrined in the territory's constitutional document, the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]].<ref>[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html \"The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China\"- Chapter 1], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008.

To safeguard judicial independence, [[law of Singapore|Singapore law]] lays down special procedures to be followed before the conduct of [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] [[judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore#The Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal, and Judges and Judicial Commissioners of the High Court|judges]] may be discussed in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|State Courts]], and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases in which they are personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges.\n\nThe [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] and other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the [[President of Singapore]] acting on the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore]]. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet's advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy [[security of tenure]] up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n===England and Wales===\n{{main|Judiciary of England and Wales}}\n\n====History====\nDuring the [[middle ages]], under the Norman monarchy of the [[Kingdom of England]], the king and his [[Curia Regis]] held judicial power. Judicial independence began to emerge during the [[early modern period]]; more courts were created and a judicial profession grew. By the fifteenth century, the king's role in this feature of government became small.<ref>Justice [[Gerard La Forest]], [[Provincial Judges Reference]], [[Supreme Court of Canada]], para. 305.</ref> Nevertheless, kings could still influence courts and dismiss judges. The [[Stuart dynasty]] used this power frequently in order to overpower the [[Parliament of England]]. After the Stuarts were removed in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, some advocated guarding against royal manipulation of the judiciary. King [[William III of England|William III]] approved the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which established tenure for judges unless Parliament removed them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref><ref>Justice Gerard La Forest, Provincial Judges Reference, para. 306.</ref>\n\n====Contemporary usage====\nUnder the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], there are two important [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] which help to preserve judicial independence. The first is that the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] does not comment on the cases which are before the court. The second is the principle of [[parliamentary privilege]]: that [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] are protected from prosecution in certain circumstances by the courts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nFurthermore, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitutional reform|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/constitutional-reform/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> In order to try to promote the independence of the judiciary, the selection process is designed to minimize political interference. The process focuses on senior members of the judiciary rather than on politicians. Part 2 of the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] aims to increase [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among the judiciary.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe pay of judges is determined by an independent pay review body. It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence from a variety of sources. The government accepts these recommendations and will traditionally implement them fully. As long as judges hold their positions in \"good order,\" they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the [[mandatory retirement]] age of 70.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nUntil 1 January 2010, the legal profession was self-regulating; with responsibility for implementing and enforcing its own professional standards and disciplining its own members. The bodies which performed this function were the [[Bar Council]] and the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]]. However, this self-regulation came to an end when approved regulators came under the regulation of the [[Legal Services Board]], composed of non-lawyers, following the passage of the [[Legal Services Act 2007]]. This saw the establishment of the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]] to regulate [[solicitor]]s and the [[Bar Standards Board]] to regulate [[barrister]]s.<ref name=\"legal_serves_act_2007\">{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Legal Services Act 2007|chapter=29|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n==United States of America==\n\n===Federal courts===\n[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the [[United States Constitution]] establishes the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] as part of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]].\n\nThe Constitution provides that [[United States federal judge|federal judges]], including judges of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] \"by and with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]].\" Once appointed, federal judges:\n\n{{quote|...both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.}}\n\nFederal judges vacate office only upon death, resignation, or [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment and removal from office]] by [[United States Congress|Congress]]; only 13 federal judges have ever been impeached. The phrase \"during good behavior\" predates the Declaration of Independence. [[John Adams]] equated it with ''quamdiu se bene gesserint'' in a letter to the [[Boston Gazette]] published on 11 January 1773,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Works of John Adams, Vol 3|last=Adams|first=John|year=1851|publisher=Little and Brown|place=Boston|page=522}}</ref> a phrase that first appeared in section 3 of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] in England.\n\nThe President is free to appoint any person to the federal bench, yet typically he consults with the [[American Bar Association]], whose Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rates each nominee \"Well Qualified,\" \"Qualified\" or \"Not Qualified.\"\n\n===State courts===\n[[State court (United States)|State courts]] deal with independence of the judiciary in many ways, and several forms of judicial selection are used for both [[trial court]]s and [[appellate court]]s (including [[state supreme court]]s), varying between states and sometimes within states. In some [[U.S. state|states]], judges are elected (sometime on a partisan ballot, other times on a [[nonpartisan]] one), while in others they are appointed by the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].\n\nThe 2000 case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', in which a majority of the Supreme Court, including some appointees of President George H. W. Bush, overruled challenges to the election of the [[George W. Bush]] then pending in the [[Florida Supreme Court]], whose members had all been appointed by Democratic governors, is seen by many as reinforcing the need for judicial independence, both with regard to the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court. This case has increased focus and attention on judicial outcomes as opposed to the traditional focus on judicial qualifications.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Judicial reform]]\n*[[Judiciary in Russia]]\n*[[Political corruption#Judiciary corruption|Political corruption \u00a7 Judiciary corruption]]\n*[[Rule According to Higher Law]]\n*[[Rule of law]]\n*[[Separation of powers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*Independence of the judicial system [https://web.archive.org/web/20100625023314/http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2010/CDL-AD(2010)004-e.pdf Part I.

While the programme has made significant headway towards genuine financial inclusion, it is clear that improving policy communication, widening and deepening progress in low-income states, and ironing out the kinks in the bank-agent model will be crucial if these hard-fought gains are to prove sustainable.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=The admirable success of the Jan Dhan Yojana|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/wfertnZlyGRTmGiyGnJLrI/The-admirable-success-of-the-JanDhan-Yojana.html|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> At least 300 million new families have got Jan Dhan accounts in which almost {{INRConvert|650|b}} have been deposited, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on 28 August 2017, on the eve of third anniversary of the scheme aimed at financial inclusion.\n\n==Criticism==\nThe scheme has been criticized by opposition as an effort to please voters that has created unnecessary work-burden on the public-sector banks.According to the experts, offers like zero balance, free insurance and overdraft facility would result in duplication. Many individuals who already have bank accounts may have had accounts created for themselves, lured by the insurance covers and overdraft facilities.<ref name=\"cr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/critics-attack-wasteful-ineffective-pm-jan-dhan-yojana_1169557.html|title=Critics attack 'wasteful, ineffective' PM Jan Dhan Yojana|work=[[Moneycontrol.com]] }}</ref> As per the scheme, a very few people are eligible to get the life insurance worth {{INRConvert|30|k}} with a validity of just five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.licindia.in/pages/PMJDY_Guidelines&Features.pdf|title=PMJDY Guidelines & Features |work=[[LIC India]] }}</ref> The claimed overdraft facility has been completely left upon the banks.

The AN/SPS-32 was a long-range air search and target acquisition radar developed by Hughes for the U.S. Navy.

[[Henry Fonda]] played the role of Frank Beardsley, a U.S. Navy warrant officer attached to the ship.\n\n''Enterprise'' was a principal setting of the popular movie ''[[Top Gun]]'' released in 1986. Director [[Tony Scott]] filmed actual flight operations aboard ship and incorporated them into the film's plot. Some interior scenes taking place aboard ''Enterprise'' were actually filmed on {{USS|Ranger|CV-61}}.\n\nIn 1986, ''Enterprise'' was a setting of scenes in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]''. The ship was unavailable for filming, so scenes depicting ''Enterprise'' were again filmed aboard USS ''[[USS Ranger (CV-61)|Ranger]]''.<ref>Okuda, Denise & Michael (1999). ''The Star Trek Encyclopedia'', p. 90. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-53609-5}}.</ref> More important for ''[[Star Trek]]'' lore, the first nuclear aircraft carrier was in position to inspire naming of Starship {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701}}. The original premise by [[Gene Roddenberry]] dated March 1964 describes a starship USS ''Yorktown''. As USS ''Enterprise'' (CVN-65) was then one of the newest and most celebrated ships of the US Navy, occupying a similar status as the fictional Starship ''Enterprise'', the aircraft carrier may have inspired a name change, though Roddenberry himself had already dispelled that notion in a 1973 radio interview, reaffirming that he had named his fictional starship after its illustrious World War 2 namesake.<ref>Scott Arthur's interview with Gene Roddenberry (1973) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k77gMo8ifh4</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/oral-history-star-trek-180958779/|title=An Oral History of \"Star Trek\"|last=Gross|first=Edward|last2=Altman|first2=Mark A.|year=2016|website=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref> Nonetheless, one of Art Director [[Matt Jefferies]]' original drawings depicts the Starship ''Enterprise'' with ''Enterprise'' (CVN-65) for scale.<ref>Whitfield, Stephen and Roddenberry, Gene (1968). ''The Making of Star Trek'', p. 167. New York, Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|978-0-345-24691-2}}.</ref> Many of the subsequent ''Star Trek'' television shows and movies have been set aboard a ship named ''Enterprise'', and the starship {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|6}} of the show ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' has a relief of five Enterprise starship models and a model of CVN-65 on the wall of its observation lounge. Futhermore, in the subsequent prequel series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', a quartet of portraits depicting vessels named ''Enterprise'' adorns the wall of Captain [[Jonathan Archer]]'s ready room, the second of which is the CVN-65. A similar display is seen on the recreation deck of the ''Enterprise'' in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. The [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'' (OV-101)]], originally slated to be named ''Constitution'', was renamed after the Starship ''Enterprise'' following a write-in campaign to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]]. In 1995, ''Enterprise'' (covered as the USS ''Seahawk'') was also used to film scenes for the pilot episodes of the TV series \"[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aerial warfare]]\n* [[Air supremacy]]\n* [[Carrier strike group]]\n* [[Carrier battle group]]\n* [[List of aircraft carriers]]\n* [[List of aircraft carriers of the United States Navy]]\n*[[List of ships of the United States Navy named Enterprise|List of ships of the United States Navy named ''Enterprise'']]\n* [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov]]\n* [[U.S. Carrier Group tactics]]\n* [[Carrier Strike Group Twelve]]\n* [[List of world's longest ships]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Citation | last = Cracknell | first = W.

SCANFAR was intended to be better at tracking multiple airborne targets than conventional rotating antenna radars. SCANFAR consisted of two radars, the AN/SPS-32 and the AN/SPS-33. The AN/SPS-32 was a long-range air search and target acquisition radar developed by Hughes for the U.S. Navy. The AN/SPS-32 operated together with the AN/SPS-33, which was the square array used for 3D tracking, into one system.

While they are considered to be an early form of \"phased array\" radar, it would take the later technology of the Aegis phased array AN/SPY-1 with its electronically controlled beam steering to make phased array radars both reliable and practical for the USN.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The dome above the SCANFAR contained the unique electronic warfare suite, the Andrew Alford AA-8200 dipole antennas (which never acquired a military designation).

[[Henry Fonda]] played the role of Frank Beardsley, a U.S. Navy warrant officer attached to the ship.\n\n''Enterprise'' was a principal setting of the popular movie ''[[Top Gun]]'' released in 1986. Director [[Tony Scott]] filmed actual flight operations aboard ship and incorporated them into the film's plot. Some interior scenes taking place aboard ''Enterprise'' were actually filmed on {{USS|Ranger|CV-61}}.\n\nIn 1986, ''Enterprise'' was a setting of scenes in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]''. The ship was unavailable for filming, so scenes depicting ''Enterprise'' were again filmed aboard USS ''[[USS Ranger (CV-61)|Ranger]]''.<ref>Okuda, Denise & Michael (1999). ''The Star Trek Encyclopedia'', p. 90. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-53609-5}}.</ref> More important for ''[[Star Trek]]'' lore, the first nuclear aircraft carrier was in position to inspire naming of Starship {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701}}. The original premise by [[Gene Roddenberry]] dated March 1964 describes a starship USS ''Yorktown''. As USS ''Enterprise'' (CVN-65) was then one of the newest and most celebrated ships of the US Navy, occupying a similar status as the fictional Starship ''Enterprise'', the aircraft carrier may have inspired a name change, though Roddenberry himself had already dispelled that notion in a 1973 radio interview, reaffirming that he had named his fictional starship after its illustrious World War 2 namesake.<ref>Scott Arthur's interview with Gene Roddenberry (1973) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k77gMo8ifh4</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/oral-history-star-trek-180958779/|title=An Oral History of \"Star Trek\"|last=Gross|first=Edward|last2=Altman|first2=Mark A.|year=2016|website=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref> Nonetheless, one of Art Director [[Matt Jefferies]]' original drawings depicts the Starship ''Enterprise'' with ''Enterprise'' (CVN-65) for scale.<ref>Whitfield, Stephen and Roddenberry, Gene (1968). ''The Making of Star Trek'', p. 167. New York, Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|978-0-345-24691-2}}.</ref> Many of the subsequent ''Star Trek'' television shows and movies have been set aboard a ship named ''Enterprise'', and the starship {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|6}} of the show ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' has a relief of five Enterprise starship models and a model of CVN-65 on the wall of its observation lounge. Futhermore, in the subsequent prequel series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', a quartet of portraits depicting vessels named ''Enterprise'' adorns the wall of Captain [[Jonathan Archer]]'s ready room, the second of which is the CVN-65. A similar display is seen on the recreation deck of the ''Enterprise'' in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. The [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'' (OV-101)]], originally slated to be named ''Constitution'', was renamed after the Starship ''Enterprise'' following a write-in campaign to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]]. In 1995, ''Enterprise'' (covered as the USS ''Seahawk'') was also used to film scenes for the pilot episodes of the TV series \"[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aerial warfare]]\n* [[Air supremacy]]\n* [[Carrier strike group]]\n* [[Carrier battle group]]\n* [[List of aircraft carriers]]\n* [[List of aircraft carriers of the United States Navy]]\n*[[List of ships of the United States Navy named Enterprise|List of ships of the United States Navy named ''Enterprise'']]\n* [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov]]\n* [[U.S. Carrier Group tactics]]\n* [[Carrier Strike Group Twelve]]\n* [[List of world's longest ships]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Citation | last = Cracknell | first = W.
