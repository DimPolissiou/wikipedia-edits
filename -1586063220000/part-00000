It was released on 12 December 1966. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], who had previously directed the films ''[[High Noon]]'' and ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''.\n\nThe film and play both depict the final years of [[Sir Thomas More]], the 16th-century [[Lord Chancellor]] of England who refused both to sign a letter asking [[Pope Clement VII]] to annul King [[Henry VIII of England]]'s marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] and to take an [[Oath of Supremacy]] declaring Henry VIII [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. [[Paul Scofield]], who had played More in the West End stage premiere, also took the role in the film, starring alongside [[Wendy Hiller]], [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]], [[Orson Welles]] and [[Susannah York]]. Also appearing are [[Nigel Davenport]], [[Leo McKern]], [[Corin Redgrave]] and, in one of his earliest screen roles, [[John Hurt]].\n\n''A Man for All Seasons'' was a critical and box-office success. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] at the [[39th Academy Awards]], while the cast and crew won another five, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Zinnemann and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Scofield. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama]] and the [[BAFTA Awards]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Best British Film]].\n\n==Title==\nThe title reflects playwright Bolt's portrayal of More as the ultimate man of [[conscience]] and as remaining true to his principles and religion under all circumstances and at all times. Bolt borrowed the title from [[Robert Whittington]], a contemporary of More, who in 1520 wrote of him:\n{{quote|More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.<ref>Whittinton, R. in [https://books.google.com/books?id=FbtZAAAAMAAJ&q=all+seasons#search_anchor The Vulgaria of John Stonbridge and the Vulgaria of Robert Whittinton], ed Beatrice White, Kraus Reprint, 1971, at Google Books.

With the annulment, Henry would be able to marry [[Anne Boleyn]], from whom he hopes to have such an heir, hence avoiding the risk of another period of dynastic wars like the [[Wars of the Roses]]. More states that he can never go along with Wolsey's suggestion that they apply \"pressure\" on Church property and revenue in England. Unknown to More, the conversation is overheard by Wolsey's aide, [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\nReturning to his home at [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] at dawn, More finds his young acquaintance [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]] waiting for his return so as to lobby for a position at Court. More recommends instead that Rich find a job as a teacher. Rich declines More's advice, saying that that option has little prestige. More finds his daughter [[Margaret Roper|Meg]] chatting with a brilliant young lawyer named [[William Roper (biographer)|William Roper]], who announces his desire to marry her. The devoutly [[Catholic]] More states that he cannot give his blessing as long as Roper remains a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]].\n\nSome time later, Wolsey dies of a heart attack. King Henry appoints More as [[Lord Chancellor]] of England to succeed Wolsey. The King makes an \"impromptu\" visit to the More estate, but More remains unmoved as Henry alternates between threats, tantrums, and promises of unbounded royal favour. After the King leaves, Cromwell promises Rich a position at Court in return for damaging information about More.\n\nRoper, learning of More's quarrel with the King, reveals that his religious opinions have altered considerably and declares that by attacking the Church, the King has become \"[[the Devil]]'s minister.\" More is admonishing Roper to be more guarded when Rich arrives, pleading again for a position at Court. When More again refuses, Rich denounces More's steward as a spy for [[Thomas Cromwell]]. An unmoved More responds, \"Of course, that's one of my servants.\"\n\nHumiliated, Rich joins Cromwell in attempting to bring More down. Meanwhile, the King has Parliament declare him \"Supreme Head of the Church of England\" and demands that bishops and Parliament renounce all allegiance to the Pope. More quietly resigns as Lord Chancellor rather than accept the new order. His close friend, [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]], attempts to draw out his opinions in a friendly private chat, but More knows that the time for speaking openly of such matters is over.\n\nCromwell, in a meeting with Norfolk, implies that More's troubles would be over were he to attend the King's wedding to Anne Boleyn. When More declines the invitation, he is summoned again to the royal palace of Hampton Court, where Cromwell has his base. Interrogated, More refuses to answer. Infuriated, Cromwell declares that the King views him as a [[traitor]], but allows him to return home. He has to do on foot, since the boatmen are aware of his political disgrace, and are unwilling to ferry him. \n\nAs More arrives at his house, his daughter Meg informs him that a [[Oath of Supremacy|new oath]] is being circulated and that all must take it or face charges of [[high treason]]. Initially, More says he would be willing to take the oath, provided it refers only to the King's marriage to Boleyn. Upon learning that it names the King as Supreme Head of the Church, More refuses to take it and is subsequently imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].\n\nMore remains steadfast in his refusal to take the Oath and refuses to explain his objections, knowing that he cannot be convicted if he has not explicitly denied the King's supremacy. A request for new books to read backfires, resulting in confiscation of the books he has, and Rich removes them from More's cell, providing an opportunity for Rich to gather further information against More.\n\nMore says goodbye to his wife [[Alice More|Alice]], Meg and Roper, urging them not to try to defend him, but to leave the country. \n\nMore is finally brought to trial, with Cromwell as prosecuting counsel, but he refuses to speak about the marriage or why he will not take the Oath. As an experienced judge, he cites his silence in defence, maintaining that the legal principle is that silence is to be taken as consent. Rich is then called by Cromwell to testify that when he went to take away More's books, More told him he would not take the Oath because Parliament did not have the authority to make the King the Head of the Church. Since, if true, More would, according to the recent legislation, have thereby committed treason, More is convicted of treason on the [[perjury|perjured]] testimony of Rich, for which the common law punishment is death, which the judges declare. It emerges that Rich has been made Attorney General for [[Wales]] as a reward for his role.\n\nUpon hearing the death sentence, More has nothing left to lose. He denounces the King's Supremacy over the Church as without legal basis, citing the Biblical foundation for the authority of the [[Papacy]] over the Church and declaring the alleged Supremacy of the King repugnant to the legal institutions of all [[Christendom]]. More further declares that the Church's immunity to State interference is guaranteed both in [[Magna Carta]] and in the King's own coronation oath. As uproar ensues, the judges pronounce the full sentence according to the standard forms: More is remitted to the Tower and condemned to death by beheading. \n\nThe scene switches from the court to the scaffold on [[Tower Hill]], where before his execution More observes custom by pardoning and tipping the executioner, and swiftly rebuts an argument of the Archbishop before declaring, \"I die his Majesty's good servant, but God's first.\" He then kneels at the block and the executioner strikes the fatal blow with the axe.\n\nA narrator intones the [[epilogue]], listing the subsequent untimely deaths of the major characters, apart from Richard Rich, who \"became Chancellor of England, and died in his bed.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Paul Scofield]] as [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]]\n* [[Wendy Hiller]] as [[Alice More]]\n* [[Leo McKern]] as [[Thomas Cromwell]]\n* [[Orson Welles]] as [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]]\n* [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]] as [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]\n* [[Susannah York]] as [[Margaret Roper|Margaret More]]\n* [[Nigel Davenport]] as the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]]\n* [[Corin Redgrave]] as [[William Roper]]\n* [[Colin Blakely]] as Matthew\n* [[Cyril Luckham]] as Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]]\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as [[Anne Boleyn]]\n* [[Jack Gwillim]] as Chief Justice\n* [[Michael Latimer]] as Norfolk's Aide\n* [[Thomas Heathcote]] as Boatman\n* [[Yootha Joyce]] as Averil Machin\n* [[Anthony Nicholls (actor)|Anthony Nicholls]] as King's Representative\n* [[John Nettleton (actor)|John Nettleton]] as Jailer\n* Eira Heath as Matthew's Wife\n* [[Molly Urquhart]] as Maid\n* [[Paul Hardwick]] as Courtier\n* Philip Brack as Captain of the Guard\n* [[Martin Boddey]] as Governor of Tower\n* [[Eric Mason]] as Executioner\n* [[Matt Zimmerman (actor)|Matt Zimmerman]] as Messenger\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Adaptation==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}\n[[Robert Bolt]] adapted the screenplay himself. The running commentary of The Common Man was deleted and the character was divided into the roles of the Thames boatman, More's steward, an innkeeper, the jailer from the Tower, the jury foreman and the executioner. The subplot involving the imperial ambassador, [[Eustace Chapuys]], was also excised. A few minor scenes were added to the play, for instance Wolsey's death, More's investiture as Chancellor, and the King's wedding to [[Anne Boleyn]], to cover narrative gaps left by the exclusion of the Common Man.\n\nThe [[Brecht]]ian staging of the final courtroom scene (which depicted the Jury as consisting of the Common Man and several sticks bearing the hats of the various characters he has played) is changed to a more naturalistic setting. Also, while [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|the Duke of Norfolk]] was the judge both historically and in the play's depiction of the trial, the character of the [[Chief Justice]] ([[Jack Gwillim]]) was created for the film. Norfolk is still present, but plays little role in the proceedings.\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}\nThe producers initially feared that Scofield was not a big enough name to draw in audiences, so the producers approached [[Richard Burton]], who turned down the part. [[Laurence Olivier]] was also considered, but director Zinnemann demanded that Scofield be cast. He played More both in London's West End and on Broadway; the latter appearance led to a Tony Award.\n\n[[Alec Guinness]] was the studio's first choice to play Cardinal Wolsey, and [[Peter O'Toole]] was the first choice to play Henry VIII. [[Richard Harris]] was also considered. Bolt wanted film director [[John Huston]] to play Norfolk, but he refused. [[Vanessa Redgrave]] was originally to have played Margaret, but she had a theatre commitment. She agreed to a cameo as [[Anne Boleyn]] on the condition that she not be billed in the part or mentioned in the previews.\n\nTo keep the budget at under $2 million, the actors all took salary cuts. Only Scofield, York, and Welles were paid salaries exceeding \u00a310,000. For playing Rich, his first major film role, [[John Hurt]] was paid \u00a33,000. [[Vanessa Redgrave]] appeared simply for the fun of it and refused to accept any money.\n\n[[Leo McKern]] had played the Common Man in the original West End production of the show, but had been shifted to Cromwell for the Broadway production. He and Scofield are the only members of the cast to appear in both the stage and screen versions of the story. Vanessa Redgrave did appear as Lady Alice in a [[A Man for All Seasons (1988 film)|1988 remake]].\n\nThe film is shot in [[Technicolor]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office success, making $28,350,000 in the US alone,<ref name=\"numbers\">[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1966/0MFAS.php Box Office Information for ''A Man For All Seasons''.] The Numbers.

Kate Cameron of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' said: \"over all these fine performances, including Robert Shaw's opulent, bluff and forceful representation of the king, it is Scofield who dominates the screen with his genteel voice and steadfast refusal to kowtow to the king, even at the expense of his head.\"<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/oscars/man-seasons-stirring-film-article-1.2054887 \"A Man for All Seasons\": 1966 review.] Retrieved 27 August 2016.</ref> However, [[Pauline Kael]] gave the film a more critical review, writing: \"There's more than a little of the school pageant in the rhythm of the movie: Though it's neater than our school drama coaches could make it, the figures group and say their assigned lines and move on.\"<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/article/95291/tnr-film-classics-man-all-seasons-february-25-1967|TNR Film Classic: \"A Man for All Seasons\"] (February 25, 1967).

Seasons''''' is a 1966 British [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on [[Robert Bolt]]'s [[A Man for All Seasons|play of the same name]] and adapted for cinema by Bolt himself. It was released on 12 December 1966. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], who had previously directed the films ''[[High Noon]]'' and ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''.\n\nThe film and play both depict the final years of [[Sir Thomas More]], the 16th-century [[Lord Chancellor]] of England who refused to sign a letter asking [[Pope Clement VII]] to annul King [[Henry VIII of England]]'s marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] and refused to take an [[Oath of Supremacy]] declaring Henry VIII [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. [[Paul Scofield]], who had played More in the West End stage premiere, also took the role in the film, starring alongside [[Wendy Hiller]], [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]], [[Orson Welles]] and [[Susannah York]]. Also appearing are [[Nigel Davenport]], [[Leo McKern]], [[Corin Redgrave]] and, in one of his earliest screen roles, [[John Hurt]].\n\n''A Man for All Seasons'' was a critical and box office success. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] at the [[39th Academy Awards]], while the cast and crew won another five, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Zinnemann and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Scofield. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama]] and the [[BAFTA Awards]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Best British Film]].\n\n==Title==\nThe title reflects playwright Bolt's portrayal of More as the ultimate man of [[conscience]] and as remaining true to his principles and religion under all circumstances and at all times. Bolt borrowed the title from [[Robert Whittington]], a contemporary of More, who in 1520 wrote of him:\n{{quote|More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.<ref>Whittinton, R. in [https://books.google.com/books?id=FbtZAAAAMAAJ&q=all+seasons#search_anchor The Vulgaria of John Stonbridge and the Vulgaria of Robert Whittinton], ed Beatrice White, Kraus Reprint, 1971, at Google Books.

With the annulment, Henry would be able to marry [[Anne Boleyn]], from whom he hopes to have such an heir, hence avoiding the risk of another period of dynastic wars like the [[Wars of the Roses]]. More states that he can never go along with Wolsey's suggestion that they apply \"pressure\" on Church property and revenue in England. Unknown to More, the conversation is overheard by Wolsey's aide, [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\nReturning to his home at [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] at dawn, More finds his young acquaintance [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]] waiting for his return so as to lobby for a position at Court. More recommends instead that Rich find a job as a teacher. Rich declines More's advice, saying that that option has little prestige. More finds his daughter [[Margaret Roper|Meg]] chatting with a brilliant young lawyer named [[William Roper (biographer)|William Roper]], who announces his desire to marry her. The devoutly [[Catholic]] More states that he cannot give his blessing as long as Roper remains a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]].\n\nSome time later, Wolsey dies of a heart attack. King Henry appoints More as [[Lord Chancellor]] of England to succeed Wolsey. The King makes an \"impromptu\" visit to the More estate, but More remains unmoved as Henry alternates between threats, tantrums, and promises of unbounded royal favour. After the King leaves, Cromwell promises Rich a position at Court in return for damaging information about More.\n\nRoper, learning of More's quarrel with the King, reveals that his religious opinions have altered considerably and declares that by attacking the Church, the King has become \"[[the Devil]]'s minister.\" More is admonishing Roper to be more guarded when Rich arrives, pleading again for a position at Court. When More again refuses, Rich denounces More's steward as a spy for [[Thomas Cromwell]]. An unmoved More responds, \"Of course, that's one of my servants.\"\n\nHumiliated, Rich joins Cromwell in attempting to bring More down. Meanwhile, the King has Parliament declare him \"Supreme Head of the Church of England\" and demands that bishops and Parliament renounce all allegiance to the Pope. More quietly resigns as Lord Chancellor rather than accept the new order. His close friend, [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]], attempts to draw out his opinions in a friendly private chat, but More knows that the time for speaking openly of such matters is over.\n\nCromwell, in a meeting with Norfolk, implies that More's troubles would be over were he to attend the King's wedding to Anne Boleyn. When More declines the invitation, he is summoned again to the royal palace of Hampton Court, where Cromwell has his base. Interrogated, More refuses to answer. Infuriated, Cromwell declares that the King views him as a [[traitor]], but allows him to return home. He has to do on foot, since the boatmen are aware of his political disgrace, and are unwilling to ferry him. \n\nAs More arrives at his house, his daughter Meg informs him that a [[Oath of Supremacy|new oath]] is being circulated and that all must take it or face charges of [[high treason]]. Initially, More says he would be willing to take the oath, provided it refers only to the King's marriage to Boleyn. Upon learning that it names the King as Supreme Head of the Church, More refuses to take it and is subsequently imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].\n\nMore remains steadfast in his refusal to take the Oath and refuses to explain his objections, knowing that he cannot be convicted if he has not explicitly denied the King's supremacy. A request for new books to read backfires, resulting in confiscation of the books he has, and Rich removes them from More's cell, providing an opportunity for Rich to gather further information against More.\n\nMore says goodbye to his wife [[Alice More|Alice]], Meg and Roper, urging them not to try to defend him, but to leave the country. \n\nMore is finally brought to trial, with Cromwell as prosecuting counsel, but he refuses to speak about the marriage or why he will not take the Oath. As an experienced judge, he cites his silence in defence, maintaining that the legal principle is that silence is to be taken as consent. Rich is then called by Cromwell to testify that when he went to take away More's books, More told him he would not take the Oath because Parliament did not have the authority to make the King the Head of the Church. Since, if true, More would, according to the recent legislation, have thereby committed treason, More is convicted of treason on the [[perjury|perjured]] testimony of Rich, for which the common law punishment is death, which the judges declare. It emerges that Rich has been made Attorney General for [[Wales]] as a reward for his role.\n\nUpon hearing the death sentence, More has nothing left to lose. He denounces the King's Supremacy over the Church as without legal basis, citing the Biblical foundation for the authority of the [[Papacy]] over the Church and declaring the alleged Supremacy of the King repugnant to the legal institutions of all [[Christendom]]. More further declares that the Church's immunity to State interference is guaranteed both in [[Magna Carta]] and in the King's own coronation oath. As uproar ensues, the judges pronounce the full sentence according to the standard forms: More is remitted to the Tower and condemned to death by beheading. \n\nThe scene switches from the court to the scaffold on [[Tower Hill]], where before his execution More observes custom by pardoning and tipping the executioner, and swiftly rebuts an argument of the Archbishop before declaring, \"I die his Majesty's good servant, but God's first.\" He then kneels at the block and the executioner strikes the fatal blow with the axe.\n\nA narrator intones the [[epilogue]], listing the subsequent untimely deaths of the major characters, apart from Richard Rich, who \"became Chancellor of England, and died in his bed.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Paul Scofield]] as [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]]\n* [[Wendy Hiller]] as [[Alice More]]\n* [[Leo McKern]] as [[Thomas Cromwell]]\n* [[Orson Welles]] as [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]]\n* [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]] as [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]\n* [[Susannah York]] as [[Margaret Roper|Margaret More]]\n* [[Nigel Davenport]] as the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]]\n* [[Corin Redgrave]] as [[William Roper]]\n* [[Colin Blakely]] as Matthew\n* [[Cyril Luckham]] as Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]]\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as [[Anne Boleyn]]\n* [[Jack Gwillim]] as Chief Justice\n* [[Michael Latimer]] as Norfolk's Aide\n* [[Thomas Heathcote]] as Boatman\n* [[Yootha Joyce]] as Averil Machin\n* [[Anthony Nicholls (actor)|Anthony Nicholls]] as King's Representative\n* [[John Nettleton (actor)|John Nettleton]] as Jailer\n* Eira Heath as Matthew's Wife\n* [[Molly Urquhart]] as Maid\n* [[Paul Hardwick]] as Courtier\n* Philip Brack as Captain of the Guard\n* [[Martin Boddey]] as Governor of Tower\n* [[Eric Mason]] as Executioner\n* [[Matt Zimmerman (actor)|Matt Zimmerman]] as Messenger\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Adaptation==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}\n[[Robert Bolt]] adapted the screenplay himself. The running commentary of The Common Man was deleted and the character was divided into the roles of the Thames boatman, More's steward, an innkeeper, the jailer from the Tower, the jury foreman and the executioner. The subplot involving the imperial ambassador, [[Eustace Chapuys]], was also excised. A few minor scenes were added to the play, for instance Wolsey's death, More's investiture as Chancellor, and the King's wedding to [[Anne Boleyn]], to cover narrative gaps left by the exclusion of the Common Man.\n\nThe [[Brecht]]ian staging of the final courtroom scene (which depicted the Jury as consisting of the Common Man and several sticks bearing the hats of the various characters he has played) is changed to a more naturalistic setting. Also, while [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|the Duke of Norfolk]] was the judge both historically and in the play's depiction of the trial, the character of the [[Chief Justice]] ([[Jack Gwillim]]) was created for the film. Norfolk is still present, but plays little role in the proceedings.\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}\nThe producers initially feared that Scofield was not a big enough name to draw in audiences, so the producers approached [[Richard Burton]], who turned down the part. [[Laurence Olivier]] was also considered, but director Zinnemann demanded that Scofield be cast. He played More both in London's West End and on Broadway; the latter appearance led to a Tony Award.\n\n[[Alec Guinness]] was the studio's first choice to play Cardinal Wolsey, and [[Peter O'Toole]] was the first choice to play Henry VIII. [[Richard Harris]] was also considered. Bolt wanted film director [[John Huston]] to play Norfolk, but he refused. [[Vanessa Redgrave]] was originally to have played Margaret, but she had a theatre commitment. She agreed to a cameo as [[Anne Boleyn]] on the condition that she not be billed in the part or mentioned in the previews.\n\nTo keep the budget at under $2 million, the actors all took salary cuts. Only Scofield, York, and Welles were paid salaries exceeding \u00a310,000. For playing Rich, his first major film role, [[John Hurt]] was paid \u00a33,000. [[Vanessa Redgrave]] appeared simply for the fun of it and refused to accept any money.\n\n[[Leo McKern]] had played the Common Man in the original West End production of the show, but had been shifted to Cromwell for the Broadway production. He and Scofield are the only members of the cast to appear in both the stage and screen versions of the story. Vanessa Redgrave did appear as Lady Alice in a [[A Man for All Seasons (1988 film)|1988 remake]].\n\nThe film is shot in [[Technicolor]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office success, making $28,350,000 in the US alone,<ref name=\"numbers\">[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1966/0MFAS.php Box Office Information for ''A Man For All Seasons''.] The Numbers.

Kate Cameron of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' said: \"over all these fine performances, including Robert Shaw's opulent, bluff and forceful representation of the king, it is Scofield who dominates the screen with his genteel voice and steadfast refusal to kowtow to the king, even at the expense of his head.\"<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/oscars/man-seasons-stirring-film-article-1.2054887 \"A Man for All Seasons\": 1966 review.] Retrieved 27 August 2016.</ref> However, [[Pauline Kael]] gave the film a more critical review, writing: \"There's more than a little of the school pageant in the rhythm of the movie: Though it's neater than our school drama coaches could make it, the figures group and say their assigned lines and move on.\"<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/article/95291/tnr-film-classics-man-all-seasons-february-25-1967|TNR Film Classic: \"A Man for All Seasons\"] (February 25, 1967).

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==Baptism of Fire==\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed their velocity of movement by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> Wilder was the principal commander of a diversion launched against Chattanooga - artillery bombardments known as the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga]] - deceiving the Confederates into thinking the Union army would approach Chattanooga from the north in conjunction with Union forces at [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]].<ref>Woodworth, p. 54.</ref>In the ensuing combat and defeating repeated attempts to dislodge his force until the infantry arrived and winning the most significant battle in the Tullahoma Campaign.\n\n==Chickamauga==\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==Baptism of Fire==\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed their velocity of movement by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> Wilder was the principal commander of a diversion launched against Chattanooga - artillery bombardments known as the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga]] - deceiving the Confederates into thinking the Union army would approach Chattanooga from the north in conjunction with Union forces at [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]].<ref>Woodworth, p. 54.</ref>In the ensuing combat and defeating repeated attempts to dislodge his force until the infantry arrived and winning the most significant battle in the Tullahoma Campaign.\n\n==Chickamauga==\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006, for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month, and for [[Linux]] on [[April Fools]]. Versions for [[Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Chef Pee Pee and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Chef Pee Pee stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris. Sonic and Elise are brought to the past and extinguish Solaris's flame, removing the god from existence and preventing the previous events from ever occurring.<ref>{{cite video game|quote='''Elise:''' This is where everything began.

It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006, for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month, and for [[Linux]] on [[April Fools]]. Versions for [[Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Chef Pee Pee and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Chef Pee Pee stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris.

The leaf blades are  6\u201355&nbsp;mm long and 2\u201317&nbsp;mm wide. The inflorescences are terminal spikes which are up to 20&nbsp;cm long.  The bracts are narrowly lanceolate to narrowly elliptic, 4\u201325&nbsp;mm long. The bracteoles are linear to ovate and 4\u20139&nbsp;mm long. The blue to white corolla is 5\u201318&nbsp;mm long, and has straight silky hairs on the outside, and is bearded on the inside.  The ovary is incompletely 2-[[Glossary of botanical terms#locular|locular]].
