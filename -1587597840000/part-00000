The Chinese movement was effectively smashed in various cities throughout the second half of 1927, culminating with the crushing of the Canton rising of December 1927.<ref name=George1 /> In March and April 1928 a wave of arrests were conducted in Japan, leading to the imprisonment of 638 individuals, with 218 sentenced to long terms of imprisonment and hundreds of others held in jail for more than 18 months without hearing or trial.<ref name=George1 />\n\nThe situation faced by radical trade unionists in China was reportedly even more draconian, with a report by Teng Chung-hsia submitted to the PPTUS in 1928 asserting that nearly 38,000 had been killed in China \u2014 including 25,000 killed in fighting various government and paramilitary forces and 13,000 who suffered execution.<ref name=Guillermaz226>Jacques Guillermaz, ''A History of the Chinese Communist Party, 1921-1949.''

The Chinese movement was effectively smashed in various cities throughout the second half of 1927, culminating with the crushing of the Canton rising of December 1927.<ref name=George1 /> In March and April 1928 a wave of arrests were conducted in Japan, leading to the imprisonment of 638 individuals, with 218 sentenced to long terms of imprisonment and hundreds of others held in jail for more than 18 months without hearing or trial.<ref name=George1 />\n\nThe situation faced by radical trade unionists in China was reportedly even more draconian, with a report by Teng Chung-hsia submitted to the PPTUS in 1928 asserting that nearly 38,000 had been killed in China \u2014 including 25,000 killed in fighting various government and paramilitary forces and 13,000 who suffered execution.<ref name=Guillermaz226>Jacques Guillermaz, ''A History of the Chinese Communist Party, 1921-1949.''

As the author of ''A Tour in the United States of America'' (1784), he used the name '''John Ferdinand Dalziel Smyth'''. \n\nLeaving America during the Revolutionary War, Stuart spent the rest of his life in England and the West Indies.\n==Background and early life==\nStuart was born in Scotland in 1745 and began life there as John Smyth or John Ferdinand Smyth. He later wrote that he was the son of R. Wentworth Smyth, a Jacobite who had fought in the risings of [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]]. According to Stuart\u2019s account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen, as his second wife. He reported that his mother was a grand-daughter of [[James Crofts (British Army officer)|General James Crofts]], a natural son of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], a son of Charles II, and that his father was Monmouth\u2019s natural son by Henrietta Maria Wentworth, a daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 5th Baron Wentworth|Thomas, Lord Wentworth]], and grand-daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland]]. Henrietta Maria had died in 1686, not long after Monmouth's execution, and her son Wentworth had been adopted by a Colonel Smyth, an [[aide-de-camp]] of Monmouth, becoming the Colonel\u2019s heir.<ref name=dnb>[[Edward Irving Carlyle]], \u201cStuart, John Ferdinand Smyth\u201d, in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]] 1885-1900'', Vol. 55</ref> Consequently, Stuart\u2019s father grew up in France.

By the 1770s, he had became a planter, renting plantations rather than owning them.<ref name=AJC/> The [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out, and on 15 October 1775, as a loyalist to Great Britain, Smyth quitted Virginia and joined the [[Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution|Loyalist forces]].

More than once he was taken prisoner, and was shackled for eighteen months.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nAt New York, at about the end of 1777, Captain Smyth wrote his ''Narrative or Journal of Capt. John Ferdinand Dalziel Smyth, of the Queen's Rangers'', setting out his adventures, and was critical of the \u201cdeluded and mistaken\u201d rebels.

In May 1779 he brought proceedings on various grounds against his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Graves Simcoe]], but they were found to be \u201cMalicious, Frivolous, Vexatious, & Groundless\u201d. Simcoe claimed that Captain Smyth \u201cavoided military service whenever possible\u201d. He was sick in quarters at a muster on 24 June 1779, and not far into 1780, he returned to England, on the grounds of ill health.<ref name=AJC/>\n\n==England and West Indies==\nStuart remained an officer on half-pay for the duration of the American War. Commissioners had been appointed to assist loyalists who had suffered losses by the war, and in 1780 they awarded Stuart a temporary allowance of \u00a3100 a year, increasing this to \u00a3200 in 1781 and to \u00a3300 in 1783. He made an application to the Privy Council to be granted [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]] in [[the Bahamas]], in view of his claimed losses of 3,300 acres in Virginia and Maryland, but he was not believed and this was rejected. His half-pay came to an end in 1783.<ref name=AJC/>\n\nIn 1784, allegations were made against Stuart to the claims commissioners, and his allowance was suspended. Stuart then wrote his book ''A Tour in the United States of America'',<ref name=dnb/> which was published by [[George Robinson (1737\u20131801)|George Robinson]] in 1784, agreeing to pay \u00a3160 for the printing. This, however, brought his account of himself to a wide public, and people who had known him in North America challenged it.<ref name=AJC/> \n\nIn 1785, Stuart went out to Jamaica, where he was appointed a Major \u201cin that Island only\u201d, but only remained there for sixteen days, as the result of a [[hurricane]].<ref name=AJC/>\n\nIn 1793, he adopted the name of Stuart, to mark his claim to descent from the [[House of Stuart]], and went on arguing his case to the government, without success.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nIn 1795, Stuart accepted a post as assistant barrack-master-general in [[San Domingo]] and to get there joined [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Hugh Cloberry Christian|Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian]] on an expedition to the [[West Indies]]. He was shipwrecked three times in 1795 and 1796 and was present at the British capture of [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Martinique]]. In San Domingo, although not employed as a medical officer, he prescribed five grains of tartarised antimony and a tablespoonful of soft sugar for the treatment of [[yellow fever]], later claiming that this had proved a good treatment.<ref name=monthly/> On his return to England, Stuart continued to pursue his financial claims unsuccessfully, but continued to write in support of them.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nIn 1803, while Stuart was barrack-master at [[Billericay]], he suffered a severe beating which knocked out several of his teeth. In the final years of his life, he was barrack-master at [[Landguard Fort]], near [[Felixstowe]] in Suffolk. In 1814, Stuart retired from this work and settled in Vernon Place, [[Bloomsbury Square]].<ref name=monthly/>\n\n==Marriages and death==\nOn 23 October 1778, while he was Captain Smyth of the [[Queen's Rangers]], against her father\u2019s wishes Stuart married Abigail Haugewout, the 23-year-old daughter of Leffert Haugewout, a loyalist farmer of [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, New York]]. They set up house in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] and had one daughter, Elizabeth, born in October 1780, but by then Smyth had gone to live in England. His pregnant wife did not go with him and lived on until 1828, on a farm of fifteen acres in Hempstead which her father gave her. In 1797, Stuart returned on a visit and met his wife in New York.

As the author of ''A Tour in the United States of America'' (1784), he used the name '''John Ferdinand Dalziel Smyth'''. \n\nLeaving America during the Revolutionary War, Stuart spent the rest of his life in England and the West Indies.\n==Background and early life==\nStuart was born in Scotland in 1745 and began life there as John Smyth or John Ferdinand Smyth. He later wrote that he was the son of R. Wentworth Smyth, a Jacobite who had fought in the risings of [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]]. According to Stuart\u2019s account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen, as his second wife. He reported that his mother was a grand-daughter of [[James Crofts (British Army officer)|General James Crofts]], a natural son of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], a son of Charles II, and that his father was Monmouth\u2019s natural son by Henrietta Maria Wentworth, a daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 5th Baron Wentworth|Thomas, Lord Wentworth]], and grand-daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland]].

He was shipwrecked three times in 1795 and 1796 and was present at the British capture of [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Martinique]].

The [[London Borough of Hackney]] lies to the north of the borough while the [[River Lea]] forms the boundary with the [[London Borough of Newham]] in the east. On the other side of the Thames is The [[London Borough of Southwark]] to the southwest, The [[London Borough of Lewisham]] to the South, and The [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]] to the southeast. The River Lea also forms the boundary between those parts of London historically in [[Middlesex]], with those formerly in [[Essex]].\n\nThe Isle of Dogs is formed from the lock entrances to the former [[West India Docks]] and the largest current [[meander]] of the River Thames and the southern part of the borough forms a part of the historic flood plain of the River Thames;<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5092218.stm \"BBC on Thames floodplain\"], BBC News.

A stretch of the [[Hertford Union Canal]] leads from the Regent's canal, at a basin in the north of [[Mile End]] to join the River Lea at [[Old Ford]]. A further canal, [[Limehouse Cut]], London's oldest, leads from locks at [[Bromley-by-Bow]] to Limehouse Basin.

It lies east of the ancient walled [[City of London]] and north of the [[River Thames]]. Use of the term \"East End\" in a pejorative sense began in the late 19th century,<ref>''East End 1888'' William Fishman (1998) p.1</ref> as the expansion of the population of London led to extreme overcrowding throughout the area and a concentration of poor people and immigrants in the districts that made it up.<ref name=women>From 1801 to 1821, the population of Bethnal Green more than doubled, and by 1831 had trebled (see table in population section). These incomers were principally weavers.

Originally it was an area characterised by villages clustered around the City walls or along the main roads, surrounded by farmland, with marshes and small communities by the River, serving the needs of shipping and the [[Royal Navy]]. Until the arrival of formal docks, shipping was required to land goods in the [[Pool of London]], but industries related to construction, repair, and victualling of ships flourished in the area from [[Tudor era|Tudor times]]. The area attracted large numbers of rural people looking for employment. Successive waves of foreign immigration began with [[Huguenot]] refugees creating a new extramural suburb in [[Spitalfields]] in the 17th century.<ref name=Huguenot>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22743 ''Bethnal Green: Settlement and Building to 1836'', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 91\u20135] Date accessed: 17 April 2007</ref> They were followed by [[Irish people|Irish]] weavers,<ref name=Irish>''Irish in Britain'' John A.

This brought the attentions of social reformers during the mid-18th century and led to the formation of [[Trade union|unions]] and workers associations at the end of the century. The radicalism of the East End contributed to the formation of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and demands for the [[Suffragette|enfranchisement of women]].\n\nOfficial attempts to address the overcrowded housing began at the beginning of the 20th century under the [[London County Council]].

These are connected, with [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstan's church]] in Stepney known as the ''Church of the High Seas''.\nThe Manor and Parish did not have a coat of arms but the (smaller) subsequent [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]] did, and extensive use has been made of elements of that.\n\nThe Shield features:\n* Ship, representing the maritime trades.\n* Sprig of [[morus (plant)|mulberry]] and a weaver's shuttle, representing the silk and other weaving activities once so important to the borough.\n* Blacksmiths fire tongs, the emblem of [[Dunstan|St Dunstan]], the patron saint of Stepney, who had close ties to the area.

It features a simplified White Tower, above a stylised representation of the Thames in the area. This was a development of the previous logo of the White Tower, in mulberry (claret) and presented in a three-tower form, as if seen from certain quarters which obscured the furthest corner tower - and a geographically accurate representation of the local part of the Thames.

Throughout the nineteenth century, the local population increased by an average of 20% every ten years. The building of the docks intensified land use and caused the last marshy areas in the south of the parish to be drained for housing and industry. In the north of the borough, employment was principally in weaving, small household industries like boot and furniture making and new industrial enterprises like [[Bryant and May]]. The availability of cheap labour drew in many employers. To the south of the parish, employment was in the docks and related industries \u2013 such as [[Ship chandler|chandler]]y and rope making.\n\nBy the middle of the century, the district of Tower Hamlets was characterised by overcrowding and poverty. The construction of the railways caused many more displaced people to settle in Tower Hamlets, and a massive influx of Eastern European [[Jewish people|Jews]] at the end of the nineteenth century added to the population growth. This influx peaked at the end of the century and [[population growth]] entered a long decline through to the 1960s, as they moved away eastwards to newer suburbs of London in [[Essex]]. The area's population had neared 600,000 around the end of the 19th century, but fell to a low of less than 140,000 by the early 1980s.\n\nThe metropolitan boroughs suffered very badly during [[World War II]], during which considerable numbers of houses were destroyed or damaged beyond use due to [[The Blitz|heavy aerial bombing]]. This coincided with a decline in work in the docks, and the closure of many traditional industries. The [[Patrick Abercrombie|Abercrombie Plan for London]] (1944) began an exodus from London towards the [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10056858&c_id=10001043&add=N ''A Vision of Britain through time''].

As such, the borough's involvement in the Olympics includes:\n\n* A small part of the Olympic Park is in [[Bow, London|Bow]], a district of the borough, which makes the borough a host borough. \n* The energy centre (King's Yard Energy Centre) of the Olympic Park is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and gives energy to all the venues, none of which are located in Tower Hamlets. \n* The world square and the London 2012 mega-store is also in the borough. The world square is for spectators, who can buy food or drink; the world's biggest McDonald's is in the world square in Tower Hamlets. \n* The London 2012 mega-store provides official gifts and souvenirs. High Street, which is the main road to the Olympic park from west and central London, combines [[Whitechapel Road]], [[Mile End Road]] and [[Bow Road]]. \n* [[Victoria Park, London|Victoria Park]], in Tower Hamlets, is an important part of the Olympics because spectators without tickets can watch the games on big screens (London live 2012); that park is less than a mile away from the Olympic park. The main spectator cycle park is located in Victoria park. One of the entrances to the Olympic park is in Tower Hamlets, and is called the Victoria gate.\n* A few schools in Tower Hamlets have taken part in the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic and Paralympic games as well as all the other host boroughs.  The section of the Olympic Park in Tower Hamlets will be named \"Sweetwater\", one of the 5 new neighbourhoods after the games. Sweetwater will cover Tower Hamlets' part of the Olympic Park near [[Old Ford]]. \n* The Olympic marathon was planned to run through the borough but later ran through the City and [[Westminster]]. However, the [[U-turn]] was located in the borough near [[The Tower of London]].\n* [[Danny Boyle]], the artistic director of the [[London 2012 opening ceremony]], lives in [[Mile End]].\n* A large number of Tower Hamlets' residents became Olympic volunteers; Tower Hamlets ranks second, after neighbouring borough [[Newham]], for the number of volunteers from the borough.\n\n==Leisure==\n\n===Parks in Tower Hamlets===\n{{Main|Tower Hamlets parks and open spaces}}\n[[File:MileEnd Park.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mile End Park]]]]\nThere are over one hundred parks and open spaces in Tower Hamlets ranging from the large [[Victoria Park, London|Victoria Park]], to numerous small gardens and squares.

This covered a wider area than the present-day borough. In 1605, the Lieutenant of the Tower was given the right to muster the militia, which led to the area east of the tower to be a distinct military unit, officially called [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets (or the Tower Division)]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=923}} The Hamlets of the Tower paid taxes for the militia in 1646.<ref name=BHO>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/acts-ordinances-interregnum/pp1057-1058 1648 Ordinance for Militia within the Hamblets of the Tower of London] British History Online</ref>\n\nThe London Borough of Tower Hamlets forms the core of the East End. It lies east of the ancient walled [[City of London]] and north of the [[River Thames]]. Use of the term \"East End\" in a pejorative sense began in the late 19th century,<ref>''East End 1888'' William Fishman (1998) p.1</ref> as the expansion of the population of London led to extreme overcrowding throughout the area and a concentration of poor people and immigrants in the districts that made it up.<ref name=women>From 1801 to 1821, the population of Bethnal Green more than doubled, and by 1831 had trebled (see table in population section). These incomers were principally weavers.

Originally it was an area characterised by villages clustered around the City walls or along the main roads, surrounded by farmland, with marshes and small communities by the River, serving the needs of shipping and the [[Royal Navy]]. Until the arrival of formal docks, shipping was required to land goods in the [[Pool of London]], but industries related to construction, repair, and victualling of ships flourished in the area from [[Tudor era|Tudor times]]. The area attracted large numbers of rural people looking for employment. Successive waves of foreign immigration began with [[Huguenot]] refugees creating a new extramural suburb in [[Spitalfields]] in the 17th century.<ref name=Huguenot>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22743 ''Bethnal Green: Settlement and Building to 1836'', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 91\u20135] Date accessed: 17 April 2007</ref> They were followed by [[Irish people|Irish]] weavers,<ref name=Irish>''Irish in Britain'' John A.

This brought the attentions of social reformers during the mid-18th century and led to the formation of [[Trade union|unions]] and workers associations at the end of the century. The radicalism of the East End contributed to the formation of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and demands for the [[Suffragette|enfranchisement of women]].\n\nOfficial attempts to address the overcrowded housing began at the beginning of the 20th century under the [[London County Council]]. [[World War II]] devastated much of the East End, with its docks, railways and industry forming a continual target, leading to dispersal of the population to new suburbs, and new housing being built in the 1950s.<ref name=palmer/> During the war, in the Boroughs making up Tower Hamlets a total of 2,221 civilians were killed and 7,472 were injured, with 46,482 houses destroyed and 47,574 damaged.<ref>''The East End at War'' Rosemary Taylor and Christopher Lloyd (Sutton Publishing, 2007) {{ISBN|0-7509-4913-9}}</ref> The closure of the last of the East End docks in the [[Port of London]] in 1980 created further challenges and led to attempts at regeneration and the formation of the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]].

These are connected, with [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstan's church]] in Stepney known as the ''Church of the High Seas''.\nThe Manor and Parish did not have a coat of arms but the (smaller) subsequent [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]] did, and extensive use has been made of elements of that.\n\nThe Shield features:\n* Ship, representing the maritime trades.\n* Sprig of [[morus (plant)|mulberry]] and a weaver's shuttle, representing the silk and other weaving activities once so important to the borough.\n* Blacksmiths fire tongs, the emblem of [[Dunstan|St Dunstan]], the patron saint of Stepney, who had close ties to the area. Dunstan famously grabbed the devil by the nose with his tongs when he tried to tempt Dunstan.\nThe crest features:\n* A silver representation of the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|(originally whitewashed) White Tower]] of the [[Tower of London]], to which the original [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets (or Tower division)]] was intimately linked.\n* Crossed gold anchors, again representing the areas position in the Port of London.\nSupporters:\n* [[Seahorse]], representing the maritime trades.\n* [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot dog]], representing the [[Isle of Dogs]].\nMotto: From great things to greater, an anglicised version of the Latin motto on the arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney.\n\nThe Council's logo is used as an alternative to the coat of arms. It features a simplified White Tower, above a stylised representation of the Thames in the area. This was a development of the previous logo of the White Tower, in mulberry (claret) and presented in a three-tower form, as if seen from certain quarters which obscured the furthest corner tower - and a geographically accurate representation of the local part of the Thames. This older version is still seen on many street signs.\n\n==Politics==\n\n{{See also|Tower Hamlets local elections}}\n\n=== Parliament ===\nFor the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], the borough was split into two [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituencies]]:\n\n* [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green & Bow]], represented by [[Rushanara Ali]] (Labour)\n* [[Poplar and Limehouse (UK Parliament constituency)|Poplar & Limehouse]], represented by [[Apsana Begum]] (Labour)\n\nUntil the [[United Kingdom]] left the [[European Union]], the borough was a part of the [[London (European Parliament constituency)|London constituency]] for elections to the [[European Parliament]].

Throughout the nineteenth century, the local population increased by an average of 20% every ten years. The building of the docks intensified land use and caused the last marshy areas in the south of the parish to be drained for housing and industry. In the north of the borough, employment was principally in weaving, small household industries like boot and furniture making and new industrial enterprises like [[Bryant and May]]. The availability of cheap labour drew in many employers. To the south of the parish, employment was in the docks and related industries \u2013 such as [[Ship chandler|chandler]]y and rope making.\n\nBy the middle of the century, the district of Tower Hamlets was characterised by overcrowding and poverty. The construction of the railways caused many more displaced people to settle in Tower Hamlets, and a massive influx of Eastern European [[Jewish people|Jews]] at the end of the nineteenth century added to the population growth. This influx peaked at the end of the century and [[population growth]] entered a long decline through to the 1960s, as they moved away eastwards to newer suburbs of London in [[Essex]]. The area's population had neared 600,000 around the end of the 19th century, but fell to a low of less than 140,000 by the early 1980s.\n\nThe metropolitan boroughs suffered very badly during [[World War II]], during which considerable numbers of houses were destroyed or damaged beyond use due to [[The Blitz|heavy aerial bombing]]. This coincided with a decline in work in the docks, and the closure of many traditional industries. The [[Patrick Abercrombie|Abercrombie Plan for London]] (1944) began an exodus from London towards the [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10056858&c_id=10001043&add=N ''A Vision of Britain through time''].

Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on [[interior lines]], Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three [[Union Army|Union armies]] (52,000 men), preventing them from reinforcing the [[Peninsula campaign|Union offensive against Richmond]].<ref>Historians differ in their classification of Jackson's campaign. Some, such as Peter Cozzens in ''Shenandoah 1862'', include Jackson's campaign against [[Romney, West Virginia]] (the [[Romney Expedition]]). Others, such as Hattaway and Jones in ''How the North Won'', or Robert K. Krick (Gallagher, p. 24), classify it as a one-month campaign that begins at the [[Battle of McDowell]] on May 8, omitting Jackson's loss at [[First Battle of Kernstown|Kernstown]] in March. The [[National Park Service]]'s [http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/bycampgn.htm#East62 Civil War Sites Advisory Commission] (and Kennedy's ''Civil War Battlefield Guide'', which is based on the CWSAC work) includes the battles from Kernstown to Port Republic, but also adds the [[Battle of Princeton Court House]], which happened during the same time period, but involved neither Jackson nor the Shenandoah Valley. The focus of this article is on Jackson's operations in the Valley that influenced the Lincoln Administration to challenge him with forces that could have been used by Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]]'s [[Peninsula campaign]] against Richmond.</ref>\n\nJackson suffered a tactical defeat (his sole defeat of the war) at the [[First Battle of Kernstown]] (March 23, 1862) against [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Nathan Kimball]] (part of Union Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]'s army), but it proved to be a strategic Confederate victory because [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] reinforced the Union's Valley forces with troops that had originally been designated for the [[Peninsula campaign]] against Richmond. On May 8, after more than a month of skirmishing with Banks, Jackson moved deceptively to the west of the Valley and drove back elements of Maj. Gen. [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]]'s army in the [[Battle of McDowell]], preventing a potential combination of the two Union armies against him. Jackson then headed down the Valley once again to confront Banks. Concealing his movement in the [[Page Valley|Luray Valley]], Jackson joined forces with Maj. Gen. [[Richard S. Ewell]] and captured the Federal garrison at [[Battle of Front Royal|Front Royal]] on May 23, causing Banks to retreat to the north. On May 25, in the [[First Battle of Winchester]], Jackson defeated Banks and pursued him until the Union Army crossed the [[Potomac River]] into [[Maryland]].\n\nBringing in Union reinforcements from eastern Virginia, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[James Shields (politician, born 1810)|James Shields]] recaptured Front Royal and planned to link up with Fr\u00e9mont in [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]]. Jackson was now threatened by three small Union armies. Withdrawing up the Valley from Winchester, Jackson was pursued by Fr\u00e9mont and Shields. On June 8, Ewell defeated Fr\u00e9mont in the [[Battle of Cross Keys]] and on the following day, crossed the North River to join forces with Jackson to defeat Shields in the [[Battle of Port Republic]], bringing the campaign to a close.\n\nJackson followed up his successful campaign by forced marches to join Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]] for the [[Seven Days Battles]] outside Richmond. His audacious campaign elevated him to the position of the most famous general in the Confederacy (until this reputation was later supplanted by Lee) and has been studied ever since by military organizations around the world.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Peninsula campaign}}\n\nIn the spring of 1862 \"Southern morale... was at its nadir\"<ref>Cozzens, p. 4.: \"Greater arguably than the strategic value of Jackson's victories in the Shenandoah Valley was the boost they gave to Southern morale, which in the spring of 1862 was at its nadir.\"  Gallagher, p. x.</ref> and \"prospects for the Confederacy's survival seemed bleak.\"<ref>McPherson, p. 454.</ref> Following the successful summer of 1861, particularly the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (First Manassas), its prospects declined quickly. Union armies in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], under [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and others, captured [[Southern United States|Southern]] territory and won significant battles at [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]]. And in the [[Eastern United States|East]], [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]]'s massive [[Army of the Potomac]] was approaching Richmond from the southeast in the [[Peninsula campaign]], Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]]'s large corps was poised to hit Richmond from the north, and Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]'s army was threatening the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. However, Jackson's Confederate troops were in \"excellent spirits,\"<ref>Henderson, p. 162.</ref> laying the foundation for his performance in the Valley that spring, which helped derail the Union plans and re-energize Confederate morale elsewhere.<ref>Cozzens, p. 4.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shenandoah watershed.png|thumb|left|320px|Shenandoah River watershed]]\n\nDuring the Civil War, the Shenandoah Valley was one of the most strategic geographic features of Virginia.  The watershed of the [[Shenandoah River]] passed between the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] on the east and the [[Allegheny Mountains]] to the west, extending 140 miles southwest from the [[Potomac River]] at [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown]] and [[Harpers Ferry]], at an average width of 25 miles. By the conventions of local residents, the \"upper Valley\" referred to the southwestern end, which had a generally higher elevation than the lower Valley to the northeast. Moving \"up the Valley\" meant traveling southwest, for instance. Between the North and South Forks of the Shenandoah River, [[Massanutten Mountain]] soared 2,900 feet and separated the Valley into two halves for about 50 miles, from [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] to [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]]. During the 19th century, there was but a single road that crossed over the mountain, from [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]] to Luray. The Valley offered two strategic advantages to the Confederates. First, a Northern army entering Virginia could be subjected to Confederate flanking attacks pouring through the many [[wind gap (geographical feature)|wind gaps]] across the Blue Ridge. Second, the Valley offered a protected avenue that allowed Confederate armies to head north into Pennsylvania unimpeded; this was the route taken by Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]] to invade the North in the [[Gettysburg campaign]] of 1863 and by Lt. Gen. [[Jubal A. Early]] in the [[Valley campaigns of 1864]]. In contrast, the orientation of the Valley offered little advantage to a Northern army headed toward Richmond. But denying the Valley to the Confederacy would be a significant blow. It was an agriculturally rich area&mdash;the 2.5 million bushels of wheat produced in 1860, for example, accounted for about 19% of the crop in the entire state and the Valley was also rich in livestock&mdash;that was used to provision Virginia's armies and the Confederate capital of Richmond. If the Federals could reach [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] in the upper Valley, they would threaten the vital [[Virginia and Tennessee Railroad]], which ran from Richmond to the [[Mississippi River]]. Stonewall Jackson wrote to a staff member, \"If this Valley is lost, Virginia is lost.\" In addition to Jackson's campaign in 1862, the Valley was subjected to conflict for virtually the entire war, most notably in the [[Valley campaigns of 1864]].<ref>Cozzens, pp. 20&ndash;21, 37&ndash;38; Gallagher, pp. xiii, 87; Eicher, p. 208; Clark, pp. 21, 84.</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n===Confederate===\n{{Further2|Orders of battle: [[Kernstown I Confederate order of battle|Kernstown]], [[McDowell Confederate order of battle|McDowell]], [[First Winchester Confederate Order of Battle|First Winchester]], [[Cross Keys Confederate order of battle|Cross Keys]], [[Port Republic Confederate order of battle|Port Republic]]}}\n\n{| style=\"align:left; margin-left:1em\"\n!bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|'''Confederate Commander and Key Subordinates'''\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=4>\nFile:Stonewall Jackson.jpg|<center>Maj.

The forces were generally from three independent commands, an arrangement which reduced the effectiveness of the Union response to Jackson.\n\nInitially, the Valley was the responsibility of Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. In March 1862, at the time of the [[First Battle of Kernstown|Battle of Kernstown]], he commanded the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]] of the [[Army of the Potomac]]; and on April 4, he assumed command of the Department of the Shenandoah. His force initially consisted of two divisions under Brig. Gens. [[James Shields (politician, born 1810)|James Shields]] and [[Alpheus S. Williams]], with an independent brigade under Brig. Gen. [[John W. Geary]]. At Kernstown, Shields' division was led by Col. [[Nathan Kimball]] with brigades under Kimball, Col. [[Jeremiah C. Sullivan]], Col. [[Erastus B. Tyler]], and cavalry under Col. [[Thornton F. Brodhead]]. At the end of April, Shields' division would be transferred from Banks to McDowell's command, leaving Banks with just one division, under Williams, consisting of the brigades of Cols. [[Dudley Donnelly]] and [[George H. Gordon]], and a cavalry brigade under Brig. Gen. [[John P. Hatch]].<ref name=UnionOOB>Cozzens, pp. 228, 515&ndash;17; Eicher, pp. 211&ndash;12; Welcher, pp. 1009&ndash;16.</ref>\n\nMaj. Gen. [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] commanded the Mountain Department, west of the Valley. In early May, part of Fr\u00e9mont's command consisting of Brig. Gen. [[Robert C. Schenck]]'s brigade and Brig. Gen. [[Robert H. Milroy]]'s brigade faced Jackson at the [[Battle of McDowell]]. At the end of May, Fremont entered the Valley with a division under Brig. Gen. [[Louis Blenker]], consisting of brigades of Brig. Gen. [[Julius Stahel|Julius H. Stahel]], Col. [[John A. Koltes]], and Brig. Gen. [[Henry Bohlen]], as well as brigades under Col. [[Gustave Paul Cluseret|Gustave P. Cluseret]], Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy, Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck, and Brig. Gen. [[George D. Bayard]].<ref name=UnionOOB/>\n\nAlso at the end of May, McDowell was ordered to send troops to the Valley.  Thus Shields returned to the Valley with his division consisting of the brigades of Brig. Gen. Nathan Kimball, Brig. Gen. [[Orris S. Ferry]], Brig. Gen. Erastus B. Tyler, and Col. [[Samuel S. Carroll]].<ref name=UnionOOB/>\n\n==Initial movements==\n\nOn November 4, 1861,<ref>Cozzens, p. 16.</ref> Jackson accepted command of the [[Valley District]], with his headquarters at [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]]. Jackson, recently a professor at [[Virginia Military Institute]] and suddenly a hero at First Manassas, was familiar with the valley terrain, having lived there for many years. His command included the [[Stonewall Brigade]] and a variety of militia units. In December, Jackson was reinforced by [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[William W. Loring]] and 6,000 troops, but his combined force was insufficient for offensive operations. While Banks remained north of the [[Potomac River]], Jackson's cavalry commander, Col. [[Turner Ashby]], raided the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] and the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]. In the [[Romney Expedition]] of early January 1862, Jackson fought inconclusively with two small Union posts at [[Battle of Hancock|Hancock, Maryland]], and [[Bath (Berkeley Springs), West Virginia|Bath]].<ref>Cozzens, pp. 70&ndash;74, 80&ndash;83.</ref>\n\nIn late February, Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] ordered Banks, reinforced by Brig. Gen. [[John Sedgwick]], across the Potomac to protect the canal and railroad from Ashby. Banks moved south against Winchester in conjunction with Shields's division approaching from the direction of Romney. Jackson's command was operating as the left wing of Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army, and when Johnston withdrew from [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]] to [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpeper]] in March, Jackson's position at Winchester was isolated. He began withdrawing \"up\" the Valley (to the higher elevations at the southwest end of the Valley) to cover the flank of [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army, withdrawing from the [[Centreville, Virginia|Centreville]]&ndash;[[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]] area to protect Richmond. Without this protective movement, the Federal army under Banks might strike at Johnston through passes in the Blue Ridge Mountains. By March 12, 1862, Banks occupied [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]] just after Jackson had withdrawn from the town, marching at a leisurely pace 42 miles up the [[Valley Pike]] to [[Mount Jackson, Virginia|Mount Jackson]]. On March 21, Jackson received word that Banks was splitting his force, with two divisions (under Brig. Gens. [[John Sedgwick]] and [[Alpheus S. Williams]]) returning to the immediate vicinity of [[Washington, D.C.]], freeing up other Union troops to participate in Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]]'s Peninsula campaign against Richmond. The remaining division, under Brig. Gen. [[James Shields (politician, born 1810)|James Shields]], was stationed at [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] to guard the lower (northeastern) Valley, and intelligence indicated that it was withdrawing toward Winchester. Banks made preparations to leave the Valley personally on March 23.<ref>Clark, pp. 65&ndash;66; Eicher, pp. 208&ndash;10; Salmon, pp. 28&ndash;30, 33; Cozzens, pp. 140&ndash;52.</ref>\n\n==Valley campaign==\n\n===Kernstown (March 23, 1862)===\n{{further|First Battle of Kernstown}}\n[[File:Kernstown1862.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions at the First Battle of Kernstown, 11 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\nJackson's orders from Johnston were to prevent Banks's force from leaving the Valley, which it appeared they were now doing. Jackson turned his men around and, in one of the more grueling forced marches of the war, moved northeast 25 miles on March 22 and another 15 to Kernstown on the morning of March 23. Ashby's cavalry skirmished with the Federals on March 22, during which engagement Shields was wounded with a broken arm from an artillery shell fragment. Despite his injury, Shields sent part of his division south of Winchester and one brigade marching to the north, seemingly abandoning the area, but in fact halting nearby to remain in reserve. He then turned over tactical command of his division to Col. Nathan Kimball, although throughout the battle to come, he sent numerous messages and orders to Kimball. Confederate loyalists in Winchester mistakenly informed Turner Ashby that Shields had left only four regiments and a few guns (about 3,000 men) and that these remaining troops had orders to march for [[Harpers Ferry]] in the morning. Jackson marched aggressively north with his 3,000-man division, reduced from its peak as stragglers fell out of the column, unaware that he was soon to be attacking almost 9,000 men.<ref>Salmon, p. 33; Clark, p. 66; Eicher, p. 210; Cozzens, pp. 155&ndash;57; Robertson, pp. 338&ndash;39.</ref>\n\nJackson moved north from [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] and arrived before the Union position at Kernstown around 11 a.m., Sunday, March 23. He sent Turner Ashby on a [[feint]] against Kimball's position on the Valley Turnpike while his main force&mdash;the brigades of Col. Samuel Fulkerson and Brig. Gen. [[Richard B. Garnett]] (the [[Stonewall Brigade]])&mdash;attacked the Union artillery position on Pritchard Hill. The lead brigade under Fulkerson was repulsed, so Jackson decided to move around the Union right flank, about 2 miles west on Sandy Ridge, which appeared to be unoccupied. Kimball countered the maneuver by moving his brigade under Col. [[Erastus B. Tyler]] to the west, but Fulkerson's men reached a stone wall facing a clearing on the ridge before the Union men could.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 168&ndash;75; Clark, pp. 67&ndash;70; Robertson, pp. 340&ndash;42.</ref>\n\nAround 4 p.m, Tyler attacked Fulkerson and Garnett on a narrow front. The Confederates were temporarily able to counter this attack with their inferior numbers by firing fierce volleys from behind the stone wall. Jackson, finally realizing the strength of the force opposing him, rushed reinforcements to his left, but by the time they arrived around 6 p.m., Garnett's Stonewall Brigade had run out of ammunition and he pulled them back, leaving Fulkerson's right flank exposed. Jackson tried in vain to rally his troops to hold, but the entire Confederate force was forced into a general retreat. Kimball organized no effective pursuit.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 176&ndash;209; Clark, 70; Eicher, 210&ndash;11; Salmon, 34&ndash;35.</ref>\n\nUnion casualties were 590 (118 killed, 450 wounded, 22 captured or missing),<ref>Cozzens, p. 215, Eicher, p. 211; Salmon, p. 35, Kennedy, p. 78, and Clark, p. 71, cite 590 total Union casualties.</ref> Confederate 718 (80 killed, 375 wounded, 263 captured or missing).<ref>Robertson, p. 346; Cozzens, p. 215, cites 737 (139 killed, 312 wounded, 253 captured, and 33 missing); Eicher, p. 211, cites 718 (80 killed, 375 wounded, and 263 missing); Clark, p. 71, Kennedy, p. 78, and Salmon, p. 35, cite 718 total Confederate casualties.</ref> Despite the Union victory, President Lincoln was disturbed by Jackson's audacity and his potential threat to Washington. He sent Banks back to the Valley along with Alpheus Williams's division. He also was concerned that Jackson might move into western Virginia against Maj. Gen. [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], so he ordered that the division of Brig. Gen. [[Louis Blenker]] be detached from McClellan's Army of the Potomac and sent to reinforce Fr\u00e9mont. Lincoln also took this opportunity to re-examine Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]]'s plans for the defenses of Washington while the Peninsula campaign was underway and decided that the forces were insufficient. He eventually ordered that the corps of Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]], which was moving south against Richmond in support of McClellan, remain in the vicinity of the capital. McClellan claimed that the loss of these forces prevented him from taking Richmond during his campaign. The strategic realignment of Union forces caused by Jackson's battle at Kernstown&mdash;the only battle he lost in his military career&mdash;turned out to be a strategic victory for the Confederacy.<ref>Clark, p. 71; Eicher, p. 211; Cozzens, pp. 215, 227&ndash;30; Salmon, p. 35.</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, Jackson arrested Brig. Gen. [[Richard B. Garnett]] for retreating from the battlefield before permission was received. He was replaced by Brig. Gen. [[Charles Sidney Winder|Charles S. Winder]]. Garnett suffered from the humiliation of his court-martial for over a year, until he was finally killed in [[Pickett's Charge]] at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].<ref>Cozzens, pp. 221&ndash;22; Robertson, pp. 349&ndash;50.</ref>\n\n===Retreating from the Valley (March 24 &ndash; May 7)===\n[[File:Jackson's Valley Campaign March 23 - May 8, 1862.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|450px|Kernstown (March 23) to McDowell (May 8)]]\n\nAt first light the day after Kernstown, Union forces pursued Jackson and drove Ashby's cavalry in a panic. However, Banks called off the pursuit while supply problems were addressed. For the next three days the Union forces advanced slowly while Jackson retreated to Mount Jackson. It was there that he directed Capt. [[Jedediah Hotchkiss]], \"I want you to make me a map of the Valley, from Harpers Ferry to [[Lexington, Virginia|Lexington]], showing all the points of offense and defense.\" Given Hotchkiss's mapmaking skills, Jackson would have a significant advantage over his Federal opponents in the campaign to come. On April 1, Banks lunged forward, advancing to Woodstock along Stony Creek, where he once again was delayed by supply problems.  Jackson took up a new position at [[Rude's Hill]] near Mount Jackson and [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]].<ref>Cozzens, pp. 215&ndash;20, 227&ndash;34; ; Clark, pp. 82&ndash;83; Robertson, p. 348.</ref>\n\nBanks advanced again on April 16, surprising Ashby's cavalry by fording Stony Creek at a place they had neglected to picket, capturing 60 of the horsemen, while the remainder of Ashby's command fought their way back to Jackson's position on Rude's Hill. Jackson assumed that Banks had been reinforced, so he abandoned his position and marched quickly up the Valley to [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] on April 18. On April 19, his men marched 20 miles east out of the Shenandoah valley to [[Swift Run Gap]]. Banks occupied New Market and crossed Massanutten Mountain to seize the bridges across the South Fork in the Luray Valley, once again besting Ashby's cavalry, who failed to destroy the bridges in time. Banks now controlled the valley as far south as Harrisonburg.<ref>Clark, pp. 86&ndash;87; Welcher, p. 1011; Cozzens, pp. 237&ndash;46.</ref>\n\nThough Banks was aware of Jackson's location, he misinterpreted Jackson's intent, thinking that Jackson was heading east of the Blue Ridge to aid Richmond. Without clear direction from Washington as to his next objective, Banks proposed his force also be sent east of the Blue Ridge, telling his superiors that \"such [an] order would electrify our force.\" Instead, Lincoln decided to detach Shield's division and transfer it to Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]] at [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], leaving Banks in the Valley with only a single division. Banks was then instructed to retreat down the valley and assume a defensive position at Strasburg.<ref>Eicher, p. 212; Clark, pp. 86&ndash;89; Cozzens, pp. 237&ndash;46.</ref>\n\nBy this time, McClellan's [[Peninsula campaign]] was well underway and Joseph E. Johnston had relocated most of his army for the direct protection of Richmond, leaving Jackson's force isolated. Johnston sent new orders to Jackson, instructing him to prevent Banks from seizing Staunton and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, reinforcing him with the 8,500-man division under Maj. Gen. [[Richard S. Ewell]], left behind at [[Brandy Station, Virginia|Brandy Station]]. Jackson, at a strong defensive position on Rude's Hill, corresponded with Ewell to develop a strategy for the campaign.<ref>Salmon, p. 35; Cozzens, p. 244; Clark, pp. 83&ndash;86.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Jackson also faced difficulty within his own command. He arrested Garnett and had a nasty confrontation with Turner Ashby in which Jackson displayed his displeasure at Ashby's performance by stripping him of 10 of his 21 cavalry companies and reassigning them to Charles S. Winder, Garnett's replacement in command of the Stonewall Brigade. Winder mediated between the two officers and the stubborn Jackson uncharacteristically backed down, restoring Ashby's command. More importantly, Jackson received an April 21 letter from Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]], military adviser to [[President of the Confederate States of America|President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], requesting that he and Ewell attack Banks to reduce the threat against Richmond that was being posed by McDowell at Fredericksburg.<ref>Peter S. Carmichael (Gallagher, pp. 156&ndash;57); Clark, pp. 89&ndash;95; Cozzens, pp. 252&ndash;54; Robertson, pp. 361&ndash;64.</ref>\n\nJackson's plan was to have Ewell's division move into position at Swift Run Gap to threaten Banks's flank, while Jackson's force marched toward the Allegheny Mountains to assist the detached 2,800 men under Brig. Gen. [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson]], who were resisting the advance toward Staunton of Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy, the leading element of Maj. Gen. John C. Fr\u00e9mont's army. If Fr\u00e9mont and Banks were allowed to combine, Jackson's forces could be overwhelmed, so Jackson planned to defeat them in detail. Without waiting for Lee's reply, Jackson executed his plan and on April 30, Ewell's division replaced Jackson's men at Swift Run Gap. Jackson marched south to the town of Port Republic in heavy rains and on May 2, turned his men east in the direction of [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and began marching over the Blue Ridge. To the surprise of his men and officers, whom Jackson habitually left in the dark as to his intentions, on May 4 they boarded trains that were heading west, not east toward Richmond, as they had anticipated. The movement to the east had been a clever deception. On May 5, Jackson's army camped around Staunton, about 6 miles from Johnson's command. On May 7, Milroy received intelligence that Jackson and Johnson were combining against him and he began to fall back toward the Alleghenies.<ref>Salmon, p. 36; Cozzens, pp. 248&ndash;49, 255&ndash;59; Clark, pp. 95&ndash;101.</ref>\n\n===McDowell (May 8)===\n{{further|Battle of McDowell}}\nOn May 8, Jackson arrived at [[McDowell, Virginia|McDowell]], a village in [[Highland County, Virginia|Highland County]], to find that Allegheny Johnson was deploying his infantry. The Union force of about 6,000 under Milroy and Schenck was camped in the village to the west side of the [[Bullpasture River]]. Overlooking the scene was a spur of Bullpasture Mountain known as Sitlington Hill, a mile-long plateau that could potentially dominate the Union position. However, there were two disadvantages: the single trail that reached the summit was so difficult that artillery could not be deployed there, and the rugged terrain&mdash;densely forested, steep slopes and ravines&mdash;offered opportunities for Union attackers to climb the 500 feet to the summit without being subjected to constant Confederate fire.<ref>Kennedy, p. 79; Cozzens, pp. 264&ndash;66; Martin, p. 83; Clark, pp. 101&ndash;102.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of McDowell map.jpg|thumb|left|A map of the battle by Jedediah Hotchkiss]]\n\nThe Union generals realized that they were outnumbered by the 10,000 men that Jackson and Johnson commanded and that their men would be particularly vulnerable to artillery fire from Sitlington Hill. They did not realize that Jackson could not bring up his artillery. Therefore, in order to buy time for their troops to withdraw at night, Milroy recommended a preemptive assault on the hill and Schenck, his superior officer, approved. At about 4:30&nbsp;p.m., 2,300 Federal troops crossed the river and assaulted Sitlington Hill. Their initial assault almost broke Johnson's right, but Jackson sent up Taliaferro's infantry and repulsed the Federals. The next attack was at the vulnerable center of the Confederate line, where the 12th Georgia Infantry occupied a salient that was subjected to fire from both sides. The Georgians, the only non-Virginians on the Confederate side, proudly and defiantly refused to withdraw to a more defensible position and took heavy casualties as they stood and fired, silhouetted against the bright sky as easy targets at the crest of the hill. One Georgia private exclaimed, \"We did not come all this way to Virginia to run before Yankees.\" By the end of the day the 540 Georgians suffered 180 casualties, losses three times greater than any other regiment on the field. Johnson was wounded and Taliaferro assumed command of the battle while Jackson brought up additional reinforcements. The fighting continued until about 10 p.m., when the Union troops withdrew.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 266&ndash;72; Keith S. Bohannon (Gallagher, pp. 119&ndash;23); Clark, pp. 102&ndash;103; Kennedy, p. 80.</ref>\n\nMilroy and Schenck marched their men north from McDowell beginning at 12:30&nbsp;a.m. on May 9. Jackson attempted to pursue, but by the time his men started the Federals were already 13 miles away. On a high ridge overlooking the road to [[Franklin, West Virginia|Franklin]], Schenck took up a defensive position and Jackson did not attempt to attack him. Union casualties were 259 (34 killed, 220 wounded, 5 missing), Confederate 420 (116 killed, 300 wounded, 4 missing), one of the rare cases in the Civil War where the attacker lost fewer men than the defender.<ref>Salmon, p. 38; Cozzens, p. 273, cites Union casualties of 259 (26 killed, 230 wounded, and 3 missing), and Confederate casualties of 532 (146 killed, 382 wounded, and 4 missing); Eicher, p. 259, cites Union casualties of 256 (26 killed, 227 wounded, and 3 missing), and Confederate casualties of 498 (75 killed and 423 wounded).</ref>\n\n===Conflicting orders (May 10&ndash;22)===\nWhile Jackson was at McDowell, Ewell was fidgeting at Swift Run Gap, trying to sort out numerous orders he was receiving from Jackson and Johnston. On May 13 Jackson ordered Ewell to pursue Banks if he withdrew down the Valley from Strasburg, whereas Johnston had ordered Ewell to leave the Valley and return to the army protecting Richmond if Banks moved eastward to join McDowell at Fredericksburg. Since Shields's division was reported to have left the Valley, Ewell was in a quandary about which orders to follow. He met in person with Jackson on May 18 at Mount Solon and the two generals decided that while in the Valley, Ewell reported operationally to Jackson, and that a prime opportunity existed to attack Banks's army, now depleted to fewer than 10,000 men, with their combined forces. When subsequent peremptory orders came to Ewell from Johnston to abandon this idea and march to Richmond, Jackson was forced to telegraph for help from Robert E. Lee, who convinced President Davis that a potential victory in the Valley had more immediate importance than countering Shields. Johnston modified his orders to Ewell: \"The object you have to accomplish is the prevention of the junction of General Banks's troops and those of General McDowell's.\"<ref>Clark, pp. 114&ndash;20; Salmon, pp. 38&ndash;40; Eicher, p. 260; Cozzens, pp. 276&ndash;82, 284&ndash;86.</ref>\n\nOn May 21, Jackson marched his command east from [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]] over Massanutten Mountain, combining with Ewell on May 22, and proceeded down the Luray Valley. Their speed of forced marching was typical of the campaign and earned his infantrymen the nickname of \"Jackson's foot cavalry\". He sent Ashby's cavalry directly north to make Banks think that he was going to attack Strasburg, where Banks began to be concerned that his 4,476 infantry, 1,600 cavalry, and 16 artillery pieces might be insufficient to withstand Jackson's 16,000 men. However, Jackson's plan was first to defeat the small Federal outpost at Front Royal (about 1,000 men of the 1st Maryland Infantry under Col. [[John Reese Kenly|John R. Kenly]]), a [[turning movement]] that would make the Strasburg position untenable.<ref>Clark, pp. 120&ndash;21; Salmon, p. 40; Eicher, p. 260; Cozzens, pp. 288&ndash;98.</ref>\n\n===Front Royal (May 23)===\n{{further|Battle of Front Royal}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Front Royal 1.png|thumb|right|Front Royal Va.&mdash;The Union Army under Banks entering the town, drawing by Edwin Forbes]]\n\nEarly on May 23, Turner Ashby and a detachment of cavalry forded the South Fork of the Shenandoah River and rode northwest to capture a Union depot and railroad trestle at Buckton Station. Two companies of Union infantry defended the structures briefly, but the Confederates prevailed and burned the building, tore up railroad track, and cut the telegraph wires, isolating Front Royal from Banks at Strasburg. Meanwhile, Jackson led his infantry on a detour over a path named Gooney Manor Road to skirt the reach of Federal guns on his approach to Front Royal. From a ridge south of town, Jackson observed that the Federals were camped near the confluence of the South and North Forks and that they would have to cross two bridges in order to escape from his pending attack.<ref>Clark, p. 123; Cozzens, pp. 307&ndash;309.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Front Royal map.png|thumb|left|\"Action at Front Royal, Va.\"]]\n\nThe center of Jackson's line of battle was the ferocious [[Louisiana Tigers]] [[battalion]] (150 men, part of Brig. Gen. [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor's]] brigade in Ewell's division), commanded by Col. [[Chatham Roberdeau Wheat|Roberdeau Wheat]], and the 1st Maryland Infantry, the latter bitter enemies of Kenly's Union 1st Maryland Infantry. The first shots were fired around 2 p.m. and the Confederates quickly pushed the small Federal detachment out of town. Kenly and his men made a stand on a hill just north of town and Jackson prepared to charge them with the Marylanders in the center and the Louisianians against their left flank. Before the attack could commence, Kenly saw Confederate cavalry approaching the bridges that he needed for his escape route and he immediately ordered his men to abandon their position. They first crossed the South Fork bridges and then the wooden Pike Bridge over the North Fork, which they set afire behind them. Taylor's Brigade raced in pursuit and Jackson ordered them to cross the burning bridge. As he saw the Federals escaping, Jackson was frustrated that he had no artillery to fire at them. His guns were delayed on the Gooney Manor Road detour route the infantry had taken and Ashby's cavalry had failed to deliver Jackson's orders for them to take the direct route after the battle started.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 297&ndash;304; Kennedy, p. 81; Salmon, pp. 40&ndash;41; Clark, pp. 123&ndash;26; Robertson, pp. 393&ndash;97.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=By God, sir, I will not retreat.

A second charge routed the Union detachment.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 304&ndash;307; Clark, pp. 126&ndash;28.</ref> The results of the battle were lopsided.

Banks initially resisted the advice of his staff to withdraw, assuming the events at Front Royal were merely a diversion. As he came to realize that his position had been turned, at about 3 a.m. he ordered his sick and wounded to be sent from Strasburg to Winchester and his infantry began to march midmorning on May 24.<ref>Salmon, p. 42; Clark, p. 128; Hattaway and Jones, p. 179.</ref>\n\nThe most significant after effect of Banks's minor loss at Front Royal was a decision by Abraham Lincoln to redirect 20,000 men from the corps of Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]] to the Valley from their intended mission to reinforce George B. McClellan on the Peninsula. At 4 p.m. on May 24, he telegraphed to McClellan, \"In consequence of General Banks's critical position I have been compelled to suspend General McDowell's movements to you. The enemy are making a desperate push upon Harper's Ferry, and we are trying to throw Fr\u00e9mont's force and part of McDowell's in their rear.\"<ref>Cozzens, p. 345; Kennedy, p. 81.</ref>\n\n===Winchester (May 25)===\n{{further|First Battle of Winchester}}\n[[File:FrontRoyalToWinchester.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions from Front Royal to First Winchester, May 24&ndash;25, 1862]]\nOn May 24, Jackson planned to intercept Banks's retreating army, but it was not clear what route Banks would take. He could either march straight for Winchester or, if the Confederates abandoned Front Royal and raced to Winchester ahead of him, he could slip behind them and escape to the east over the Blue Ridge. Jackson decided to watch the road from Cedarville to Middletown. If Banks moved directly to Winchester, Jackson could hit him in his flank by using that road, but he deemed it unwise to commit his entire force from the Front Royal area until he could rule out the Blue Ridge escape possibility. He sent scouts from Turner Ashby's cavalry on the Strasburg&ndash;Front Royal Road and two regiments of cavalry from Ewell's division, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[George H. Steuart (brigadier general)|George H. Steuart]], to Newtown, hoping to intercept the vanguard of Banks's column. At the same time, he ordered Ewell to take the bulk of his division on the road to Winchester, but not to get too far away in case he had to be recalled. The remainder of Jackson's army moved north to Cedarville.<ref>Clark, p. 129; Salmon, p. 42; Cozzens, pp. 310&ndash;19.</ref>\n\nReceiving word from Steuart that the Federals had indeed begun a retreat down the Valley Pike, Jackson began directing forces to Middletown. Although they had to contend with Union cavalry (five companies of the 1st Maine and two companies of the 1st Vermont) and were thus delayed en route, they reached a rise outside of Middletown at about 3 p.m. and began artillery bombardments of the Union column. The chaos that this produced was exacerbated by a charge by the Louisiana Tigers, who began looting and pillaging in the wagon train. When Union artillery and infantry arrived to challenge Jackson at around 4 p.m, Richard Taylor's infantry turned to meet the threat while Jackson sent his artillery and cavalry north to harass the Union column ahead. By the time Taylor's attack started the Union troops had withdrawn and Jackson realized that it was merely the rearguard of Banks's column. He sent word to Ewell to move quickly to Winchester and deploy for an attack south of the town. Jackson's men began a pursuit down the Valley Pike, but they were dismayed to see that Ashby's cavalrymen had paused to loot the wagon train and many of them had become drunk from Federal whiskey. The pursuit continued long after dark and after 1 a.m., Jackson reluctantly agreed to allow his exhausted men to rest for two hours.<ref>Clark, pp. 129&ndash;33; Cozzens, pp. 320&ndash;39; Salmon, p. 42.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=The enemy poured grape and musketry into Taylor's line as soon as it came in sight.

Major Robert L. Dabney, Jackson's chaplain<ref>Clark, p. 135.</ref>\n}}\nJackson's troops were awakened at 4 a.m. on May 25 to fight the second Sunday battle of the campaign. Jackson was pleased to find during a personal reconnaissance that Banks had not properly secured a key ridge south of the town. He ordered Charles Winder's Stonewall Brigade to occupy the hill, which they did with little opposition, but they were soon subjected to punishing artillery and small arms fire from a second ridge to the southwest&mdash;Bower's Hill, the extreme right flank of the Federal line&mdash;and their attack stalled. Jackson ordered Taylor's Brigade to deploy to the west and the Louisianians conducted a strong charge against Bower's Hill, moving up the steep slope and over a stone wall. At the same time, Ewell's men were outflanking the extreme left of the Union line. The Union lines broke and the soldiers retreated through the streets of town. Jackson later wrote that Banks's troops \"preserved their organization remarkably well\" through the town. They did so under unusual pressure, as numerous civilians&mdash;primarily women&mdash;fired at the men and hurled objects from doorways and windows. Jackson was overcome with enthusiasm and rode cheering after the retreating enemy. When a staff officer protested that he was in an exposed position, Jackson shouted \"Go back and tell the whole army to press forward to the Potomac!\"<ref>Clark, pp. 133&ndash;35; Cozzens, pp. 349&ndash;68, 373&ndash;77; Salmon, pp. 42&ndash;44.</ref>\n\nThe Confederate pursuit was ineffective because Ashby had ordered his cavalry away from the mainstream to chase a Federal detachment. Jackson lamented, \"Never was there such a chance for cavalry. Oh that my cavalry was in place!\" The Federals fled relatively unimpeded for 35 miles in 14 hours, crossing the Potomac River into [[Williamsport, Maryland]]. Union casualties were 2,019 (62 killed, 243 wounded, and 1,714 missing or captured), Confederate losses were 400 (68 killed, 329 wounded, and 3 missing).<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/shenandoah/svs3-4.html NPS report on battlefield conditions at First Winchester] and Kennedy, p. 82. Cozzens, p. 377, explains that casualty figures are difficult to calculate because the Union forces reported combined losses for Front Royal and First Winchester, amounting to 71 killed, 243 wounded, and 1,714 missing or captured; for those same 3 days, May 23&ndash;25, the Confederates reported 68 killed, 329 wounded, and 3 missing.</ref>\n\n===Union armies pursue Jackson===\n\nWord of Banks's ejection from the Valley caused consternation in Washington because of the possibility that the audacious Jackson might continue marching north and threaten the capital. President Lincoln, who in the absence of a general in chief<ref>Eicher, p. 211: McClellan was relieved of his position as general in chief in March in order to concentrate on the field operations of his Army of the Potomac.</ref> was exerting day to day strategic control over his armies in the field, took aggressive action in response. Not yielding to panic and drawing troops in for the immediate defense of the capital, he planned an elaborate offensive. He ordered Fr\u00e9mont to march from Franklin to Harrisonburg to engage Jackson and Ewell, to \"operate against the enemy in such a way as to relieve Banks.\"<ref>Clark, p. 146.</ref> He also sent orders to McDowell at Fredericksburg:\n\n{{Quote|You are instructed to lay aside for the present the movement on Richmond to put twenty thousand men in motion at once for the Shenandoah, moving on the line or in advance of the Manassas Gap Railroad.

Fr\u00e9mont's movement to Harrisonburg would place him on Jackson's supply line. Banks would recross the Potomac and pursue Jackson if he moved up the Valley. The detachment from McDowell's corps would move to Front Royal and be positioned to attack and pursue Jackson's column as it passed by, and then to crush Jackson's army against Fr\u00e9mont's position at Harrisonburg. Unfortunately for Lincoln, his plan was complex and required synchronized movements by separate commands. McDowell was unenthusiastic about his role, wishing to retain his original mission of marching against Richmond to support McClellan, but he sent the division of Brig. Gen. James Shields, recently arrived from Banks's army, marching back to the Valley, to be followed by a second division, commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord|Edward O. C. Ord]]. But Fr\u00e9mont was the real problem for Lincoln's plan. Rather than marching east to Harrisonburg as ordered, he took note of the exceptionally difficult road conditions on Lincoln's route and marched north to [[Moorefield, West Virginia|Moorefield]]. (He also was cognizant of the enormous area his department was required to defend and he was concerned about dividing his force and abandoning his subordinate, Brig. Gen. [[Jacob D. Cox]], who had been attacked in southwestern Virginia on May 23.) But as a result, instead of a figurative hammer (Shields) striking at Jackson on an anvil (Fr\u00e9mont), all Lincoln could hope for would be a pincer movement catching Jackson at Strasburg, which would require intricate timing to succeed.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 408&ndash;15; William J. Miller (Gallagher, pp. 65&ndash;66); Clark, pp. 146&ndash;49; Salmon, p. 45.</ref>\n\nJackson received word of Shields's return march on May 26, but he had been urged by Robert E. Lee to threaten the line of the Potomac. So while the bulk of his army camped near [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], he ordered the Stonewall Brigade to demonstrate against Harpers Ferry on May 29&ndash;30. On May 30, Shields recaptured Front Royal and Jackson began moving his army back to Winchester. Lincoln's plan continued to unravel as Banks declared his army was too shaken to move in pursuit (and would remain north of the Potomac until June 10), Fr\u00e9mont moved slowly on poor roads (in contrast to Jackson, whose men had the advantage of the [[macadam]]ized Valley Pike), and Shields would not leave Front Royal until Ord's division arrived. Jackson reached Strasburg before either of the Union armies and the only source of concern was that the Stonewall Brigade had been delayed at Harpers Ferry, but it caught up with the rest of Jackson's army after noon on June 1.<ref>Clark, pp. 150&ndash;56; Eicher, p. 263; Kennedy, p. 82; Cozzens, pp. 23&ndash;25, 395&ndash;402.</ref>\n\nOn June 2, Union forces pursued Jackson&mdash;McDowell up the Luray Valley and Fr\u00e9mont up the main Valley (west of Massanutten Mountain). Jackson's men made good time on the Valley Pike, marching more than 40 miles in one 36-hour period, but heavy rains and deep mud delayed their pursuers. For the next five days, frequent clashes occurred between Turner Ashby's cavalry (screening the rear of Jackson's march) and lead Union cavalry. Ashby also burned some bridges across the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, delaying the Union pursuit and keeping Shields's and Fr\u00e9mont's forces separated. When contact was reestablished on June 6, Ashby was killed on Chestnut Ridge near Harrisonburg in a skirmish with Fr\u00e9mont's cavalry, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[George D. Bayard]]. This was a significant loss for the Confederacy since Ashby (the \"Black Knight\") was one of its most promising cavalry generals (Ashby having been promoted to brigadier general on June 3). Jackson later wrote, \"As a partisan officer, I never knew his superior.\"<ref>Eicher, p. 263; Robertson, pp. 428&ndash;29; Cozzens, pp. 424&ndash;28, 438&ndash;40; Salmon, p. 46; Krick, pp. 21, 26&ndash;32; Clark, pp. 157&ndash;58.</ref>\n\nAs the two Union armies converged at the southwestern end of Massanutten Mountain, Jackson had the option of escaping through Brown's Gap towards Charlottesville and marching to Richmond, which was closely threatened by McClellan's army. However, he was determined to finish his work in the Valley by defeating the two opposing armies in detail. To accomplish this, he recognized that the small town of [[Port Republic, Virginia|Port Republic]] would be crucial. If he could hold or destroy the bridges in this area at the confluence of the South River and North River with the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, he could prevent the two Union armies from combining against him. He positioned most of his army on the high ground overlooking the town from the south bank of the North River, from where his artillery could command the town and fords across the South River, preventing Shields from crossing. He deployed Ewell's division on a ridge about 7 miles north near the village of Cross Keys, ready to receive Fr\u00e9mont.<ref>Salmon, pp. 46&ndash;47; Robertson, pp. 430&ndash;31; Freeman, vol. 1, p. 444; Clark, pp. 158&ndash;59.</ref>\n\nOn June 7, Ewell maneuvered in an invitation for Fr\u00e9mont to attack him, but despite receiving a message from his colleague Shields, urging him to \"thunder down on [Jackson's] rear,\" Fr\u00e9mont demurred in the face of Ewell's strong position. On Sunday, June 8, Jackson hoped to avoid a fight on the Sabbath, but a raid by Shields's cavalry, commanded by Col. [[Samuel S. Carroll]], almost captured the Confederate trains in Port Republic and Jackson himself narrowly escaped by galloping over a bridge across the North River.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 443&ndash;51; Robertson, pp. 431&ndash;32; Eicher, p. 265; Krick, pp. 39&ndash;86; Salmon, p. 48; Clark, pp. 160&ndash;61.</ref>\n\n===Cross Keys (June 8)===\n{{further|Battle of Cross Keys}}\n[[File:Battle of Cross Keys map.png|thumb|Sketch of the battle-field of Cross Keys, Va., June 8, 1862, Julius Bien & Co.]]\nFr\u00e9mont moved cautiously to approach Ewell's position on the morning of June 8, assuming that he was outnumbered, although he actually outnumbered the Confederates 11,500 to 5,800. (Richard Taylor's brigade was detached from Ewell's division for service with Jackson.) His men were held up by the determined skirmishers of the 15th Alabama Infantry for over an hour and he was unable to bring up his guns until 10 a.m. His opening artillery barrage was ineffective and did little more than alert Jackson at Port Republic that the battle had started. Fr\u00e9mont's men were arranged in a line running southwest to northeast on the Keezletown Road, facing Ewell's strong position about a mile south on a ridge behind Mill Creek, with both flanks anchored by dense woods. As they advanced, they wheeled left to become roughly parallel with the Confederate line. At about noon the Federal brigade on the left, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[Julius Stahel]], chased a group of North Carolina skirmishers from Brig. Gen. [[Isaac R. Trimble]]'s brigade across a clearing and up a hill, only to be surprised by a wave of musket fire. The 500 men of the 8th New York Infantry suffered nearly 50% casualties in the engagement.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 456&ndash;64; Krick, pp. 137&ndash;81; Eicher, p. 265; Kennedy, p. 84; Salmon, p. 49; Clark, p. 164.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Cross Keys 1.png|thumb|left|The battle of Cross Keys&mdash;Sunday June 7, 1862 [sic]&mdash;Genl. Fremont and Genl. Jackson, drawing by Edwin Forbes]]\nBy mid-afternoon, Fr\u00e9mont had sent only five of his 24 regiments into battle and Ewell expected another attack. The impatient Trimble launched his own offensive against a Union battery, which took his brigade a mile in advance of the rest of Ewell's division. He and his men sat there for the rest of the afternoon, inviting an attack that never came. As Fr\u00e9mont withdrew his men back to the Keezletown Road, Ewell decided against a counterattack, knowing that his force was seriously outnumbered. Trimble proposed the idea of a night attack to both Ewell and Jackson, but neither general agreed. The Confederates merely advanced to the previous Union position, ending a battle that, considering the percentage of troops engaged, was little more than a skirmish.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 464&ndash;76; Kennedy, p. 84; Krick, pp. 183&ndash;275; Salmon, p. 49; Freeman, vol. 1, pp. 445&ndash;46; Eicher, pp. 265&ndash;66; Clark, p. 164.</ref> Union casualties were 684, Confederate only 288, although two of Ewell's brigade commanders, Brig.

[[Isaac R. Trimble]]]]\n\nStonewall Jackson's plan for June 9 was to concentrate his forces and overwhelm the outnumbered Shields at Port Republic. He rightly assumed that Fr\u00e9mont would be too shaken to launch a major attack and that he could be held at bay with a mere token force, so he ordered the majority of Ewell's division to withdraw under the cover of darkness. They slipped away from Fr\u00e9mont and crossed the North River bridge. A hastily constructed bridge across the South River allowed the Confederates to move into the foggy, flat bottomland below the south bank of the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. The Stonewall Brigade led the advance on the road to Conrad's Store, the direction from which Shields would be approaching. Also that morning, Jackson ordered his trains to begin a march into Brown's Gap.<ref>Krick, pp. 277&ndash;95; Freeman, vol. 1, p. 448; Salmon, p. 50; Clark, p. 165; Krick, p. 470.</ref>\n\n===Port Republic (June 9)===\n{{further|Battle of Port Republic}}\n[[File:Port Republic.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Battle of Port Republic]]\nJackson learned at 7 a.m. that the Federals were approaching his column. Without proper reconnaissance or waiting for the bulk of his force to come up, he ordered Winder's Stonewall Brigade to charge through the thinning fog. The brigade was caught between artillery on its flank and rifle volleys to its front and fell back in disarray. They had run into two brigades at the vanguard of Shields's army, 3,000 men under Brig. Gen. [[Erastus B. Tyler]]. Attempting to extricate himself from a potential disaster, Jackson realized that the Union artillery fire was coming from a spur of the Blue Ridge that was known locally as the Coaling, where charcoal was made by a local family for their blacksmith shop. Jackson and Winder sent the [[2nd Virginia Infantry|2nd]] and [[4th Virginia Infantry]] regiments through the thick underbrush up the hill, where they encountered three Union infantry regiments supporting the artillery and were repulsed.<ref>Salmon, p. 51; Clark, pp. 167&ndash;68; Cozzens, pp. 480&ndash;84; Krick, pp. 355&ndash;90; Kennedy, p. 85.</ref>\n\nAfter his assault on the Coaling failed, Jackson ordered the rest of Ewell's division, primarily Trimble's brigade, to cross over the North River bridge and burn it behind them, keeping Fr\u00e9mont's men isolated to the north of the River. While he waited for these troops to arrive, Jackson reinforced his line with the 7th Louisiana Infantry of Taylor's brigade and ordered Taylor to make another attempt against the Union batteries. Winder perceived that the Federals were about to attack, so he ordered a preemptive charge, but in the face of point-blank volleys and running low on ammunition, the Stonewall Brigade was routed. At this point, Ewell arrived on the battlefield and ordered the [[44th Virginia Infantry|44th]] and [[58th Virginia Infantry]] regiments to strike the left flank of the advancing Union battle line. Tyler's men fell back, but reorganized and drove Ewell's men into the forest south of the Coaling.<ref>Clark, pp. 168&ndash;69; Cozzens, pp. 484&ndash;91; Krick, pp. 391&ndash;417; Salmon, pp. 51&ndash;53; Kennedy, p. 87.</ref>\n\nTaylor attacked the infantry and artillery on the Coaling three times before prevailing, but having achieved their objective, were faced by a new charge from three Ohio regiments. It was only the surprise appearance by Ewell's troops that convinced Tyler to withdraw his men. The Confederates began bombarding the Union troops on the flat lands, with Ewell himself gleefully manning one of the cannons. More Confederate reinforcements began to arrive, including the brigade of Brig. Gen. [[William B. Taliaferro]], and the Union army reluctantly began to withdraw. Jackson remarked to Ewell, \"General, he who does not see the hand of God in this is blind, sir, blind.\"<ref>Clark, 169&ndash;70; Eicher, p. 266; Cozzens, pp. 491&ndash;97; Krick, pp. 419&ndash;58; Kennedy, p. 87; Salmon, pp. 53&ndash;54.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=The impetuosity of Jackson had betrayed him into attacking before his troops were sufficiently massed, which was made difficult by the insufficient means of crossing the river.\n|source=Brig.

Fr\u00e9mont marched back to Harrisonburg, where he was frustrated to find orders from Lincoln he had not received in time, telling him not to advance beyond that town against Jackson. As the weather became clear, Jackson's cavalry under Col. [[Thomas T. Munford]] harassed Fr\u00e9mont's withdrawal, which reached Mount Jackson on June 11, and then unencumbered to Middletown on June 14 where he joined with Banks and Brig. Gen. [[Franz Sigel]]. Shields, who complained bitterly about the exhaustion of his division, marched slowly to Front Royal and on June 21 marched across the Blue Ridge to join Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]].<ref>Cozzens, pp. 502&ndash;504.</ref>\n\nJackson sent messages to Richmond requesting that his force be augmented to 40,000 men so that he could assume the offensive down the Valley and across the Potomac. Lee sent him about 14,000 reinforcements, but then revealed his plan to call Jackson to Richmond to counterattack McClellan's Army of the Potomac and drive it away from Richmond. He needed all of the combat power he could muster and he wanted Jackson to attack the relatively unprotected right flank of McClellan's army, north of the [[Chickahominy River]]. Shortly after midnight on June 18, Jackson's men began to march toward the [[Virginia Peninsula]]. They fought with Lee in the [[Seven Days Battles]], from June 25 to July 1. Jackson delivered an uncharacteristically lethargic performance in many of those battles, perhaps because of the physical strains of the Valley campaign and the exhausting march to Richmond.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 504&ndash;12; Salmon, p. 64; Robert E. L. Krick (Gallagher, p. 204).</ref>\n\nWith the success of his Valley campaign, Stonewall Jackson became the most celebrated soldier in the Confederacy (until his reputation was eventually eclipsed by Lee's), and his victories lifted the morale of the public. In a classic military campaign of surprise and maneuver, he pressed his army to travel 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days of marching and won five significant victories with a force of about 17,000 against a combined force of over 50,000. Jackson had accomplished his difficult mission, causing Washington to withhold over 40,000 troops from McClellan's offensive.<ref>Freeman, vol. 1, pp. 485&ndash;86; Eicher, p. 266; Salmon, p. 64; Gallagher, p. xi.</ref> Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones summarized a successful campaign:\n\n{{Quote|Always outnumbered seven to three, every time Jackson engaged he fought with the odds of about four to three in his favor&mdash;because, moving rapidly on interior lines, he hit fractions of his enemy with the bulk of his own command. ... Jackson enjoyed the great advantage that the northerners remained widely scattered on a perimeter within which his troops could maneuver to concentrate against first one and then another of the Union forces. Lincoln managed very well, personally maneuvering the scattered Union armies. Since neither Lincoln nor his advisers felt that Jackson's small force could truly threaten Washington, they chose an offensive response as they sought to exploit their overwhelming forces and exterior position to overwhelm his army. But Jackson's great ability, celerity of movement, and successful series of small fights determined the outcome.|Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones, ''How the North Won''<ref>Hattaway and Jones, p. 176.</ref>}}\n\nOn the Union side, a command shakeup resulted from the embarrassing defeat by a smaller force. McDowell's corps remained in the defense of Washington, with only one division (under Brig. Gen. [[George A. McCall]]) able to join McClellan on the Peninsula. Lincoln was disillusioned by the command difficulties of controlling multiple forces in this campaign and created a single new army, the [[Army of Virginia]], under Maj. Gen. John Pope, incorporating the units of Banks, Fr\u00e9mont, McDowell, and several smaller ones from around Washington and western Virginia. This army was soundly defeated by Lee and Jackson in August at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] during the [[northern Virginia campaign]].<ref>Eicher, pp. 317&ndash;18; Salmon, pp. 126&ndash;31.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n* Clark, Champ, and the Editors of Time-Life Books.

Gen.]] [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's]] spring 1862 campaign through the [[Shenandoah Valley]] in [[Virginia]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on [[interior lines]], Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three [[Union Army|Union armies]] (52,000 men), preventing them from reinforcing the [[Peninsula campaign|Union offensive against Richmond]].<ref>Historians differ in their classification of Jackson's campaign. Some, such as Peter Cozzens in ''Shenandoah 1862'', include Jackson's campaign against [[Romney, West Virginia]] (the [[Romney Expedition]]). Others, such as Hattaway and Jones in ''How the North Won'', or Robert K. Krick (Gallagher, p. 24), classify it as a one-month campaign that begins at the [[Battle of McDowell]] on May 8, omitting Jackson's loss at [[First Battle of Kernstown|Kernstown]] in March. The [[National Park Service]]'s [http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/bycampgn.htm#East62 Civil War Sites Advisory Commission] (and Kennedy's ''Civil War Battlefield Guide'', which is based on the CWSAC work) includes the battles from Kernstown to Port Republic, but also adds the [[Battle of Princeton Court House]], which happened during the same time period, but involved neither Jackson nor the Shenandoah Valley. The focus of this article is on Jackson's operations in the Valley that influenced the Lincoln Administration to challenge him with forces that could have been used by Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]]'s [[Peninsula campaign]] against Richmond.</ref>\n\nJackson suffered a tactical defeat (his sole defeat of the war) at the [[First Battle of Kernstown]] (March 23, 1862) against [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Nathan Kimball]] (part of Union Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]'s army), but it proved to be a strategic Confederate victory because [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] reinforced the Union's Valley forces with troops that had originally been designated for the [[Peninsula campaign]] against Richmond. On May 8, after more than a month of skirmishing with Banks, Jackson moved deceptively to the west of the Valley and drove back elements of Maj. Gen. [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]]'s army in the [[Battle of McDowell]], preventing a potential combination of the two Union armies against him. Jackson then headed down the Valley once again to confront Banks. Concealing his movement in the [[Page Valley|Luray Valley]], Jackson joined forces with Maj. Gen. [[Richard S. Ewell]] and captured the Federal garrison at [[Battle of Front Royal|Front Royal]] on May 23, causing Banks to retreat to the north. On May 25, in the [[First Battle of Winchester]], Jackson defeated Banks and pursued him until the Union Army crossed the [[Potomac River]] into [[Maryland]].\n\nBringing in Union reinforcements from eastern Virginia, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[James Shields (politician, born 1810)|James Shields]] recaptured Front Royal and planned to link up with Fr\u00e9mont in [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]]. Jackson was now threatened by three small Union armies. Withdrawing up the Valley from Winchester, Jackson was pursued by Fr\u00e9mont and Shields. On June 8, Ewell defeated Fr\u00e9mont in the [[Battle of Cross Keys]] and on the following day, crossed the North River to join forces with Jackson to defeat Shields in the [[Battle of Port Republic]], bringing the campaign to a close.\n\nJackson followed up his successful campaign by forced marches to join Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]] for the [[Seven Days Battles]] outside Richmond. His audacious campaign elevated him to the position of the most famous general in the Confederacy (until this reputation was later supplanted by Lee) and has been studied ever since by military organizations around the world.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Peninsula campaign}}\n\nIn the spring of 1862 \"Southern morale... was at its nadir\"<ref>Cozzens, p. 4.: \"Greater arguably than the strategic value of Jackson's victories in the Shenandoah Valley was the boost they gave to Southern morale, which in the spring of 1862 was at its nadir.\"  Gallagher, p. x.</ref> and \"prospects for the Confederacy's survival seemed bleak.\"<ref>McPherson, p. 454.</ref> Following the successful summer of 1861, particularly the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (First Manassas), its prospects declined quickly. Union armies in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], under [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and others, captured [[Southern United States|Southern]] territory and won significant battles at [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]]. And in the [[Eastern United States|East]], [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]]'s massive [[Army of the Potomac]] was approaching Richmond from the southeast in the [[Peninsula campaign]], Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]]'s large corps was poised to hit Richmond from the north, and Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]'s army was threatening the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. However, Jackson's Confederate troops were in \"excellent spirits,\"<ref>Henderson, p. 162.</ref> laying the foundation for his performance in the Valley that spring, which helped derail the Union plans and re-energize Confederate morale elsewhere.<ref>Cozzens, p. 4.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shenandoah watershed.png|thumb|left|320px|Shenandoah River watershed]]\n\nDuring the Civil War, the Shenandoah Valley was one of the most strategic geographic features of Virginia.  The watershed of the [[Shenandoah River]] passed between the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] on the east and the [[Allegheny Mountains]] to the west, extending 140 miles southwest from the [[Potomac River]] at [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown]] and [[Harpers Ferry]], at an average width of 25 miles. By the conventions of local residents, the \"upper Valley\" referred to the southwestern end, which had a generally higher elevation than the lower Valley to the northeast. Moving \"up the Valley\" meant traveling southwest, for instance. Between the North and South Forks of the Shenandoah River, [[Massanutten Mountain]] soared 2,900 feet and separated the Valley into two halves for about 50 miles, from [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] to [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]]. During the 19th century, there was but a single road that crossed over the mountain, from [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]] to Luray. The Valley offered two strategic advantages to the Confederates. First, a Northern army entering Virginia could be subjected to Confederate flanking attacks pouring through the many [[wind gap (geographical feature)|wind gaps]] across the Blue Ridge. Second, the Valley offered a protected avenue that allowed Confederate armies to head north into Pennsylvania unimpeded; this was the route taken by Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]] to invade the North in the [[Gettysburg campaign]] of 1863 and by Lt. Gen. [[Jubal A. Early]] in the [[Valley campaigns of 1864]]. In contrast, the orientation of the Valley offered little advantage to a Northern army headed toward Richmond. But denying the Valley to the Confederacy would be a significant blow. It was an agriculturally rich area&mdash;the 2.5 million bushels of wheat produced in 1860, for example, accounted for about 19% of the crop in the entire state and the Valley was also rich in livestock&mdash;that was used to provision Virginia's armies and the Confederate capital of Richmond. If the Federals could reach [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] in the upper Valley, they would threaten the vital [[Virginia and Tennessee Railroad]], which ran from Richmond to the [[Mississippi River]]. Stonewall Jackson wrote to a staff member, \"If this Valley is lost, Virginia is lost.\" In addition to Jackson's campaign in 1862, the Valley was subjected to conflict for virtually the entire war, most notably in the [[Valley campaigns of 1864]].<ref>Cozzens, pp. 20&ndash;21, 37&ndash;38; Gallagher, pp. xiii, 87; Eicher, p. 208; Clark, pp. 21, 84.</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n===Confederate===\n{{Further2|Orders of battle: [[Kernstown I Confederate order of battle|Kernstown]], [[McDowell Confederate order of battle|McDowell]], [[First Winchester Confederate Order of Battle|First Winchester]], [[Cross Keys Confederate order of battle|Cross Keys]], [[Port Republic Confederate order of battle|Port Republic]]}}\n\n{| style=\"align:left; margin-left:1em\"\n!bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|'''Confederate Commander and Key Subordinates'''\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=4>\nFile:Stonewall Jackson.jpg|<center>Maj.

The forces were generally from three independent commands, an arrangement which reduced the effectiveness of the Union response to Jackson.\n\nInitially, the Valley was the responsibility of Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. In March 1862, at the time of the [[First Battle of Kernstown|Battle of Kernstown]], he commanded the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]] of the [[Army of the Potomac]]; and on April 4, he assumed command of the Department of the Shenandoah. His force initially consisted of two divisions under Brig. Gens. [[James Shields (politician, born 1810)|James Shields]] and [[Alpheus S. Williams]], with an independent brigade under Brig. Gen. [[John W. Geary]]. At Kernstown, Shields' division was led by Col. [[Nathan Kimball]] with brigades under Kimball, Col. [[Jeremiah C. Sullivan]], Col. [[Erastus B. Tyler]], and cavalry under Col. [[Thornton F. Brodhead]]. At the end of April, Shields' division would be transferred from Banks to McDowell's command, leaving Banks with just one division, under Williams, consisting of the brigades of Cols.

Fr\u00e9mont]] commanded the Mountain Department, west of the Valley. In early May, part of Fr\u00e9mont's command consisting of Brig. Gen. [[Robert C. Schenck]]'s brigade and Brig. Gen. [[Robert H. Milroy]]'s brigade faced Jackson at the [[Battle of McDowell]]. At the end of May, Fremont entered the Valley with a division under Brig. Gen. [[Louis Blenker]], consisting of brigades of Brig. Gen. [[Julius Stahel|Julius H. Stahel]], Col. [[John A. Koltes]], and Brig. Gen. [[Henry Bohlen]], as well as brigades under Col. [[Gustave Paul Cluseret|Gustave P. Cluseret]], Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy, Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck, and Brig. Gen. [[George D. Bayard]].<ref name=UnionOOB/>\n\nAlso at the end of May, McDowell was ordered to send troops to the Valley.  Thus Shields returned to the Valley with his division consisting of the brigades of Brig. Gen. Nathan Kimball, Brig. Gen. [[Orris S. Ferry]], Brig. Gen. Erastus B. Tyler, and Col. [[Samuel S. Carroll]].<ref name=UnionOOB/>\n\n==Initial movements==\n\nOn November 4, 1861,<ref>Cozzens, p. 16.</ref> Jackson accepted command of the [[Valley District]], with his headquarters at [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]]. Jackson, recently a professor at [[Virginia Military Institute]] and suddenly a hero at First Manassas, was familiar with the valley terrain, having lived there for many years. His command included the [[Stonewall Brigade]] and a variety of militia units. In December, Jackson was reinforced by [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[William W. Loring]] and 6,000 troops, but his combined force was insufficient for offensive operations. While Banks remained north of the [[Potomac River]], Jackson's cavalry commander, Col. [[Turner Ashby]], raided the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] and the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]. In the [[Romney Expedition]] of early January 1862, Jackson fought inconclusively with two small Union posts at [[Battle of Hancock|Hancock, Maryland]], and [[Bath (Berkeley Springs), West Virginia|Bath]].<ref>Cozzens, pp. 70&ndash;74, 80&ndash;83.</ref>\n\nIn late February, Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] ordered Banks, reinforced by Brig. Gen. [[John Sedgwick]], across the Potomac to protect the canal and railroad from Ashby. Banks moved south against Winchester in conjunction with Shields's division approaching from the direction of Romney. Jackson's command was operating as the left wing of Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army, and when Johnston withdrew from [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]] to [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpeper]] in March, Jackson's position at Winchester was isolated. He began withdrawing \"up\" the Valley (to the higher elevations at the southwest end of the Valley) to cover the flank of [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army, withdrawing from the [[Centreville, Virginia|Centreville]]&ndash;[[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]] area to protect Richmond. Without this protective movement, the Federal army under Banks might strike at Johnston through passes in the Blue Ridge Mountains. By March 12, 1862, Banks occupied [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]] just after Jackson had withdrawn from the town, marching at a leisurely pace 42 miles up the [[Valley Pike]] to [[Mount Jackson, Virginia|Mount Jackson]]. On March 21, Jackson received word that Banks was splitting his force, with two divisions (under Brig. Gens. [[John Sedgwick]] and [[Alpheus S. Williams]]) returning to the immediate vicinity of [[Washington, D.C.]], freeing up other Union troops to participate in Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]]'s Peninsula campaign against Richmond. The remaining division, under Brig. Gen. [[James Shields (politician, born 1810)|James Shields]], was stationed at [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] to guard the lower (northeastern) Valley, and intelligence indicated that it was withdrawing toward Winchester. Banks made preparations to leave the Valley personally on March 23.<ref>Clark, pp. 65&ndash;66; Eicher, pp. 208&ndash;10; Salmon, pp. 28&ndash;30, 33; Cozzens, pp. 140&ndash;52.</ref>\n\n==Valley campaign==\n\n===Kernstown (March 23, 1862)===\n{{further|First Battle of Kernstown}}\n[[File:Kernstown1862.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions at the First Battle of Kernstown, 11 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\nJackson's orders from Johnston were to prevent Banks's force from leaving the Valley, which it appeared they were now doing. Jackson turned his men around and, in one of the more grueling forced marches of the war, moved northeast 25 miles on March 22 and another 15 to Kernstown on the morning of March 23. Ashby's cavalry skirmished with the Federals on March 22, during which engagement Shields was wounded with a broken arm from an artillery shell fragment. Despite his injury, Shields sent part of his division south of Winchester and one brigade marching to the north, seemingly abandoning the area, but in fact halting nearby to remain in reserve. He then turned over tactical command of his division to Col. Nathan Kimball, although throughout the battle to come, he sent numerous messages and orders to Kimball. Confederate loyalists in Winchester mistakenly informed Turner Ashby that Shields had left only four regiments and a few guns (about 3,000 men) and that these remaining troops had orders to march for [[Harpers Ferry]] in the morning. Jackson marched aggressively north with his 3,000-man division, reduced from its peak as stragglers fell out of the column, unaware that he was soon to be attacking almost 9,000 men.<ref>Salmon, p. 33; Clark, p. 66; Eicher, p. 210; Cozzens, pp. 155&ndash;57; Robertson, pp. 338&ndash;39.</ref>\n\nJackson moved north from [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] and arrived before the Union position at Kernstown around 11 a.m., Sunday, March 23. He sent Turner Ashby on a [[feint]] against Kimball's position on the Valley Turnpike while his main force&mdash;the brigades of Col. Samuel Fulkerson and Brig. Gen. [[Richard B. Garnett]] (the [[Stonewall Brigade]])&mdash;attacked the Union artillery position on Pritchard Hill. The lead brigade under Fulkerson was repulsed, so Jackson decided to move around the Union right flank, about 2 miles west on Sandy Ridge, which appeared to be unoccupied. Kimball countered the maneuver by moving his brigade under Col. [[Erastus B. Tyler]] to the west, but Fulkerson's men reached a stone wall facing a clearing on the ridge before the Union men could.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 168&ndash;75; Clark, pp. 67&ndash;70; Robertson, pp. 340&ndash;42.</ref>\n\nAround 4 p.m, Tyler attacked Fulkerson and Garnett on a narrow front. The Confederates were temporarily able to counter this attack with their inferior numbers by firing fierce volleys from behind the stone wall. Jackson, finally realizing the strength of the force opposing him, rushed reinforcements to his left, but by the time they arrived around 6 p.m., Garnett's Stonewall Brigade had run out of ammunition and he pulled them back, leaving Fulkerson's right flank exposed. Jackson tried in vain to rally his troops to hold, but the entire Confederate force was forced into a general retreat. Kimball organized no effective pursuit.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 176&ndash;209; Clark, 70; Eicher, 210&ndash;11; Salmon, 34&ndash;35.</ref>\n\nUnion casualties were 590 (118 killed, 450 wounded, 22 captured or missing),<ref>Cozzens, p. 215, Eicher, p. 211; Salmon, p. 35, Kennedy, p. 78, and Clark, p. 71, cite 590 total Union casualties.</ref> Confederate 718 (80 killed, 375 wounded, 263 captured or missing).<ref>Robertson, p. 346; Cozzens, p. 215, cites 737 (139 killed, 312 wounded, 253 captured, and 33 missing); Eicher, p. 211, cites 718 (80 killed, 375 wounded, and 263 missing); Clark, p. 71, Kennedy, p. 78, and Salmon, p. 35, cite 718 total Confederate casualties.</ref> Despite the Union victory, President Lincoln was disturbed by Jackson's audacity and his potential threat to Washington. He sent Banks back to the Valley along with Alpheus Williams's division. He also was concerned that Jackson might move into western Virginia against Maj. Gen. [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], so he ordered that the division of Brig. Gen. [[Louis Blenker]] be detached from McClellan's Army of the Potomac and sent to reinforce Fr\u00e9mont. Lincoln also took this opportunity to re-examine Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]]'s plans for the defenses of Washington while the Peninsula campaign was underway and decided that the forces were insufficient. He eventually ordered that the corps of Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]], which was moving south against Richmond in support of McClellan, remain in the vicinity of the capital. McClellan claimed that the loss of these forces prevented him from taking Richmond during his campaign. The strategic realignment of Union forces caused by Jackson's battle at Kernstown&mdash;the only battle he lost in his military career&mdash;turned out to be a strategic victory for the Confederacy.<ref>Clark, p. 71; Eicher, p. 211; Cozzens, pp. 215, 227&ndash;30; Salmon, p. 35.</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, Jackson arrested Brig. Gen. [[Richard B. Garnett]] for retreating from the battlefield before permission was received. He was replaced by Brig. Gen. [[Charles Sidney Winder|Charles S. Winder]]. Garnett suffered from the humiliation of his court-martial for over a year, until he was finally killed in [[Pickett's Charge]] at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].<ref>Cozzens, pp. 221&ndash;22; Robertson, pp. 349&ndash;50.</ref>\n\n===Retreating from the Valley (March 24 &ndash; May 7)===\n[[File:Jackson's Valley Campaign March 23 - May 8, 1862.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|450px|Kernstown (March 23) to McDowell (May 8)]]\n\nAt first light the day after Kernstown, Union forces pursued Jackson and drove Ashby's cavalry in a panic. However, Banks called off the pursuit while supply problems were addressed. For the next three days the Union forces advanced slowly while Jackson retreated to Mount Jackson. It was there that he directed Capt. [[Jedediah Hotchkiss]], \"I want you to make me a map of the Valley, from Harpers Ferry to [[Lexington, Virginia|Lexington]], showing all the points of offense and defense.\" Given Hotchkiss's mapmaking skills, Jackson would have a significant advantage over his Federal opponents in the campaign to come. On April 1, Banks lunged forward, advancing to Woodstock along Stony Creek, where he once again was delayed by supply problems.  Jackson took up a new position at [[Rude's Hill]] near Mount Jackson and [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]].<ref>Cozzens, pp. 215&ndash;20, 227&ndash;34; ; Clark, pp. 82&ndash;83; Robertson, p. 348.</ref>\n\nBanks advanced again on April 16, surprising Ashby's cavalry by fording Stony Creek at a place they had neglected to picket, capturing 60 of the horsemen, while the remainder of Ashby's command fought their way back to Jackson's position on Rude's Hill. Jackson assumed that Banks had been reinforced, so he abandoned his position and marched quickly up the Valley to [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] on April 18. On April 19, his men marched 20 miles east out of the Shenandoah valley to [[Swift Run Gap]]. Banks occupied New Market and crossed Massanutten Mountain to seize the bridges across the South Fork in the Luray Valley, once again besting Ashby's cavalry, who failed to destroy the bridges in time. Banks now controlled the valley as far south as Harrisonburg.<ref>Clark, pp. 86&ndash;87; Welcher, p. 1011; Cozzens, pp. 237&ndash;46.</ref>\n\nThough Banks was aware of Jackson's location, he misinterpreted Jackson's intent, thinking that Jackson was heading east of the Blue Ridge to aid Richmond. Without clear direction from Washington as to his next objective, Banks proposed his force also be sent east of the Blue Ridge, telling his superiors that \"such [an] order would electrify our force.\" Instead, Lincoln decided to detach Shield's division and transfer it to Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]] at [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], leaving Banks in the Valley with only a single division. Banks was then instructed to retreat down the valley and assume a defensive position at Strasburg.<ref>Eicher, p. 212; Clark, pp. 86&ndash;89; Cozzens, pp. 237&ndash;46.</ref>\n\nBy this time, McClellan's [[Peninsula campaign]] was well underway and Joseph E. Johnston had relocated most of his army for the direct protection of Richmond, leaving Jackson's force isolated. Johnston sent new orders to Jackson, instructing him to prevent Banks from seizing Staunton and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, reinforcing him with the 8,500-man division under Maj. Gen. [[Richard S. Ewell]], left behind at [[Brandy Station, Virginia|Brandy Station]]. Jackson, at a strong defensive position on Rude's Hill, corresponded with Ewell to develop a strategy for the campaign.<ref>Salmon, p. 35; Cozzens, p. 244; Clark, pp. 83&ndash;86.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Jackson also faced difficulty within his own command. He arrested Garnett and had a nasty confrontation with Turner Ashby in which Jackson displayed his displeasure at Ashby's performance by stripping him of 10 of his 21 cavalry companies and reassigning them to Charles S. Winder, Garnett's replacement in command of the Stonewall Brigade. Winder mediated between the two officers and the stubborn Jackson uncharacteristically backed down, restoring Ashby's command. More importantly, Jackson received an April 21 letter from Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]], military adviser to [[President of the Confederate States of America|President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], requesting that he and Ewell attack Banks to reduce the threat against Richmond that was being posed by McDowell at Fredericksburg.<ref>Peter S. Carmichael (Gallagher, pp. 156&ndash;57); Clark, pp. 89&ndash;95; Cozzens, pp. 252&ndash;54; Robertson, pp. 361&ndash;64.</ref>\n\nJackson's plan was to have Ewell's division move into position at Swift Run Gap to threaten Banks's flank, while Jackson's force marched toward the Allegheny Mountains to assist the detached 2,800 men under Brig. Gen. [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson]], who were resisting the advance toward Staunton of Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy, the leading element of Maj. Gen. John C. Fr\u00e9mont's army. If Fr\u00e9mont and Banks were allowed to combine, Jackson's forces could be overwhelmed, so Jackson planned to defeat them in detail. Without waiting for Lee's reply, Jackson executed his plan and on April 30, Ewell's division replaced Jackson's men at Swift Run Gap. Jackson marched south to the town of Port Republic in heavy rains and on May 2, turned his men east in the direction of [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and began marching over the Blue Ridge. To the surprise of his men and officers, whom Jackson habitually left in the dark as to his intentions, on May 4 they boarded trains that were heading west, not east toward Richmond, as they had anticipated. The movement to the east had been a clever deception. On May 5, Jackson's army camped around Staunton, about 6 miles from Johnson's command. On May 7, Milroy received intelligence that Jackson and Johnson were combining against him and he began to fall back toward the Alleghenies.<ref>Salmon, p. 36; Cozzens, pp. 248&ndash;49, 255&ndash;59; Clark, pp. 95&ndash;101.</ref>\n\n===McDowell (May 8)===\n{{further|Battle of McDowell}}\nOn May 8, Jackson arrived at [[McDowell, Virginia|McDowell]], a village in [[Highland County, Virginia|Highland County]], to find that Allegheny Johnson was deploying his infantry. The Union force of about 6,000 under Milroy and Schenck was camped in the village to the west side of the [[Bullpasture River]]. Overlooking the scene was a spur of Bullpasture Mountain known as Sitlington Hill, a mile-long plateau that could potentially dominate the Union position. However, there were two disadvantages: the single trail that reached the summit was so difficult that artillery could not be deployed there, and the rugged terrain&mdash;densely forested, steep slopes and ravines&mdash;offered opportunities for Union attackers to climb the 500 feet to the summit without being subjected to constant Confederate fire.<ref>Kennedy, p. 79; Cozzens, pp. 264&ndash;66; Martin, p. 83; Clark, pp. 101&ndash;102.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of McDowell map.jpg|thumb|left|A map of the battle by Jedediah Hotchkiss]]\n\nThe Union generals realized that they were outnumbered by the 10,000 men that Jackson and Johnson commanded and that their men would be particularly vulnerable to artillery fire from Sitlington Hill. They did not realize that Jackson could not bring up his artillery. Therefore, in order to buy time for their troops to withdraw at night, Milroy recommended a preemptive assault on the hill and Schenck, his superior officer, approved. At about 4:30&nbsp;p.m., 2,300 Federal troops crossed the river and assaulted Sitlington Hill. Their initial assault almost broke Johnson's right, but Jackson sent up Taliaferro's infantry and repulsed the Federals. The next attack was at the vulnerable center of the Confederate line, where the 12th Georgia Infantry occupied a salient that was subjected to fire from both sides. The Georgians, the only non-Virginians on the Confederate side, proudly and defiantly refused to withdraw to a more defensible position and took heavy casualties as they stood and fired, silhouetted against the bright sky as easy targets at the crest of the hill. One Georgia private exclaimed, \"We did not come all this way to Virginia to run before Yankees.\" By the end of the day the 540 Georgians suffered 180 casualties, losses three times greater than any other regiment on the field. Johnson was wounded and Taliaferro assumed command of the battle while Jackson brought up additional reinforcements. The fighting continued until about 10 p.m., when the Union troops withdrew.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 266&ndash;72; Keith S. Bohannon (Gallagher, pp. 119&ndash;23); Clark, pp. 102&ndash;103; Kennedy, p. 80.</ref>\n\nMilroy and Schenck marched their men north from McDowell beginning at 12:30&nbsp;a.m. on May 9. Jackson attempted to pursue, but by the time his men started the Federals were already 13 miles away. On a high ridge overlooking the road to [[Franklin, West Virginia|Franklin]], Schenck took up a defensive position and Jackson did not attempt to attack him. Union casualties were 259 (34 killed, 220 wounded, 5 missing), Confederate 420 (116 killed, 300 wounded, 4 missing), one of the rare cases in the Civil War where the attacker lost fewer men than the defender.<ref>Salmon, p. 38; Cozzens, p. 273, cites Union casualties of 259 (26 killed, 230 wounded, and 3 missing), and Confederate casualties of 532 (146 killed, 382 wounded, and 4 missing); Eicher, p. 259, cites Union casualties of 256 (26 killed, 227 wounded, and 3 missing), and Confederate casualties of 498 (75 killed and 423 wounded).</ref>\n\n===Conflicting orders (May 10&ndash;22)===\nWhile Jackson was at McDowell, Ewell was fidgeting at Swift Run Gap, trying to sort out numerous orders he was receiving from Jackson and Johnston. On May 13 Jackson ordered Ewell to pursue Banks if he withdrew down the Valley from Strasburg, whereas Johnston had ordered Ewell to leave the Valley and return to the army protecting Richmond if Banks moved eastward to join McDowell at Fredericksburg. Since Shields's division was reported to have left the Valley, Ewell was in a quandary about which orders to follow. He met in person with Jackson on May 18 at Mount Solon and the two generals decided that while in the Valley, Ewell reported operationally to Jackson, and that a prime opportunity existed to attack Banks's army, now depleted to fewer than 10,000 men, with their combined forces. When subsequent peremptory orders came to Ewell from Johnston to abandon this idea and march to Richmond, Jackson was forced to telegraph for help from Robert E. Lee, who convinced President Davis that a potential victory in the Valley had more immediate importance than countering Shields. Johnston modified his orders to Ewell: \"The object you have to accomplish is the prevention of the junction of General Banks's troops and those of General McDowell's.\"<ref>Clark, pp. 114&ndash;20; Salmon, pp. 38&ndash;40; Eicher, p. 260; Cozzens, pp. 276&ndash;82, 284&ndash;86.</ref>\n\nOn May 21, Jackson marched his command east from [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]] over Massanutten Mountain, combining with Ewell on May 22, and proceeded down the Luray Valley. Their speed of forced marching was typical of the campaign and earned his infantrymen the nickname of \"Jackson's foot cavalry\". He sent Ashby's cavalry directly north to make Banks think that he was going to attack Strasburg, where Banks began to be concerned that his 4,476 infantry, 1,600 cavalry, and 16 artillery pieces might be insufficient to withstand Jackson's 16,000 men. However, Jackson's plan was first to defeat the small Federal outpost at Front Royal (about 1,000 men of the 1st Maryland Infantry under Col. [[John Reese Kenly|John R. Kenly]]), a [[turning movement]] that would make the Strasburg position untenable.<ref>Clark, pp. 120&ndash;21; Salmon, p. 40; Eicher, p. 260; Cozzens, pp. 288&ndash;98.</ref>\n\n===Front Royal (May 23)===\n{{further|Battle of Front Royal}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Front Royal 1.png|thumb|right|Front Royal Va.&mdash;The Union Army under Banks entering the town, drawing by Edwin Forbes]]\n\nEarly on May 23, Turner Ashby and a detachment of cavalry forded the South Fork of the Shenandoah River and rode northwest to capture a Union depot and railroad trestle at Buckton Station. Two companies of Union infantry defended the structures briefly, but the Confederates prevailed and burned the building, tore up railroad track, and cut the telegraph wires, isolating Front Royal from Banks at Strasburg. Meanwhile, Jackson led his infantry on a detour over a path named Gooney Manor Road to skirt the reach of Federal guns on his approach to Front Royal. From a ridge south of town, Jackson observed that the Federals were camped near the confluence of the South and North Forks and that they would have to cross two bridges in order to escape from his pending attack.<ref>Clark, p. 123; Cozzens, pp. 307&ndash;309.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Front Royal map.png|thumb|left|\"Action at Front Royal, Va.\"]]\n\nThe center of Jackson's line of battle was the ferocious [[Louisiana Tigers]] [[battalion]] (150 men, part of Brig. Gen. [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor's]] brigade in Ewell's division), commanded by Col. [[Chatham Roberdeau Wheat|Roberdeau Wheat]], and the 1st Maryland Infantry, the latter bitter enemies of Kenly's Union 1st Maryland Infantry. The first shots were fired around 2 p.m. and the Confederates quickly pushed the small Federal detachment out of town. Kenly and his men made a stand on a hill just north of town and Jackson prepared to charge them with the Marylanders in the center and the Louisianians against their left flank. Before the attack could commence, Kenly saw Confederate cavalry approaching the bridges that he needed for his escape route and he immediately ordered his men to abandon their position. They first crossed the South Fork bridges and then the wooden Pike Bridge over the North Fork, which they set afire behind them. Taylor's Brigade raced in pursuit and Jackson ordered them to cross the burning bridge. As he saw the Federals escaping, Jackson was frustrated that he had no artillery to fire at them. His guns were delayed on the Gooney Manor Road detour route the infantry had taken and Ashby's cavalry had failed to deliver Jackson's orders for them to take the direct route after the battle started.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 297&ndash;304; Kennedy, p. 81; Salmon, pp. 40&ndash;41; Clark, pp. 123&ndash;26; Robertson, pp. 393&ndash;97.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=By God, sir, I will not retreat.

A second charge routed the Union detachment.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 304&ndash;307; Clark, pp. 126&ndash;28.</ref> The results of the battle were lopsided.

Banks initially resisted the advice of his staff to withdraw, assuming the events at Front Royal were merely a diversion. As he came to realize that his position had been turned, at about 3 a.m. he ordered his sick and wounded to be sent from Strasburg to Winchester and his infantry began to march midmorning on May 24.<ref>Salmon, p. 42; Clark, p. 128; Hattaway and Jones, p. 179.</ref>\n\nThe most significant after effect of Banks's minor loss at Front Royal was a decision by Abraham Lincoln to redirect 20,000 men from the corps of Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]] to the Valley from their intended mission to reinforce George B. McClellan on the Peninsula. At 4 p.m. on May 24, he telegraphed to McClellan, \"In consequence of General Banks's critical position I have been compelled to suspend General McDowell's movements to you. The enemy are making a desperate push upon Harper's Ferry, and we are trying to throw Fr\u00e9mont's force and part of McDowell's in their rear.\"<ref>Cozzens, p. 345; Kennedy, p. 81.</ref>\n\n===Winchester (May 25)===\n{{further|First Battle of Winchester}}\n[[File:FrontRoyalToWinchester.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions from Front Royal to First Winchester, May 24&ndash;25, 1862]]\nOn May 24, Jackson planned to intercept Banks's retreating army, but it was not clear what route Banks would take. He could either march straight for Winchester or, if the Confederates abandoned Front Royal and raced to Winchester ahead of him, he could slip behind them and escape to the east over the Blue Ridge. Jackson decided to watch the road from Cedarville to Middletown. If Banks moved directly to Winchester, Jackson could hit him in his flank by using that road, but he deemed it unwise to commit his entire force from the Front Royal area until he could rule out the Blue Ridge escape possibility. He sent scouts from Turner Ashby's cavalry on the Strasburg&ndash;Front Royal Road and two regiments of cavalry from Ewell's division, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[George H. Steuart (brigadier general)|George H. Steuart]], to Newtown, hoping to intercept the vanguard of Banks's column. At the same time, he ordered Ewell to take the bulk of his division on the road to Winchester, but not to get too far away in case he had to be recalled. The remainder of Jackson's army moved north to Cedarville.<ref>Clark, p. 129; Salmon, p. 42; Cozzens, pp. 310&ndash;19.</ref>\n\nReceiving word from Steuart that the Federals had indeed begun a retreat down the Valley Pike, Jackson began directing forces to Middletown. Although they had to contend with Union cavalry (five companies of the 1st Maine and two companies of the 1st Vermont) and were thus delayed en route, they reached a rise outside of Middletown at about 3 p.m. and began artillery bombardments of the Union column. The chaos that this produced was exacerbated by a charge by the Louisiana Tigers, who began looting and pillaging in the wagon train. When Union artillery and infantry arrived to challenge Jackson at around 4 p.m, Richard Taylor's infantry turned to meet the threat while Jackson sent his artillery and cavalry north to harass the Union column ahead. By the time Taylor's attack started the Union troops had withdrawn and Jackson realized that it was merely the rearguard of Banks's column. He sent word to Ewell to move quickly to Winchester and deploy for an attack south of the town. Jackson's men began a pursuit down the Valley Pike, but they were dismayed to see that Ashby's cavalrymen had paused to loot the wagon train and many of them had become drunk from Federal whiskey. The pursuit continued long after dark and after 1 a.m., Jackson reluctantly agreed to allow his exhausted men to rest for two hours.<ref>Clark, pp. 129&ndash;33; Cozzens, pp. 320&ndash;39; Salmon, p. 42.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=The enemy poured grape and musketry into Taylor's line as soon as it came in sight.

He ordered Charles Winder's Stonewall Brigade to occupy the hill, which they did with little opposition, but they were soon subjected to punishing artillery and small arms fire from a second ridge to the southwest&mdash;Bower's Hill, the extreme right flank of the Federal line&mdash;and their attack stalled. Jackson ordered Taylor's Brigade to deploy to the west and the Louisianians conducted a strong charge against Bower's Hill, moving up the steep slope and over a stone wall. At the same time, Ewell's men were outflanking the extreme left of the Union line. The Union lines broke and the soldiers retreated through the streets of town. Jackson later wrote that Banks's troops \"preserved their organization remarkably well\" through the town. They did so under unusual pressure, as numerous civilians&mdash;primarily women&mdash;fired at the men and hurled objects from doorways and windows. Jackson was overcome with enthusiasm and rode cheering after the retreating enemy. When a staff officer protested that he was in an exposed position, Jackson shouted \"Go back and tell the whole army to press forward to the Potomac!\"<ref>Clark, pp. 133&ndash;35; Cozzens, pp. 349&ndash;68, 373&ndash;77; Salmon, pp. 42&ndash;44.</ref>\n\nThe Confederate pursuit was ineffective because Ashby had ordered his cavalry away from the mainstream to chase a Federal detachment. Jackson lamented, \"Never was there such a chance for cavalry. Oh that my cavalry was in place!\" The Federals fled relatively unimpeded for 35 miles in 14 hours, crossing the Potomac River into [[Williamsport, Maryland]]. Union casualties were 2,019 (62 killed, 243 wounded, and 1,714 missing or captured), Confederate losses were 400 (68 killed, 329 wounded, and 3 missing).<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/shenandoah/svs3-4.html NPS report on battlefield conditions at First Winchester] and Kennedy, p. 82. Cozzens, p. 377, explains that casualty figures are difficult to calculate because the Union forces reported combined losses for Front Royal and First Winchester, amounting to 71 killed, 243 wounded, and 1,714 missing or captured; for those same 3 days, May 23&ndash;25, the Confederates reported 68 killed, 329 wounded, and 3 missing.</ref>\n\n===Union armies pursue Jackson===\n\nWord of Banks's ejection from the Valley caused consternation in Washington because of the possibility that the audacious Jackson might continue marching north and threaten the capital. President Lincoln, who in the absence of a general in chief<ref>Eicher, p. 211: McClellan was relieved of his position as general in chief in March in order to concentrate on the field operations of his Army of the Potomac.</ref> was exerting day to day strategic control over his armies in the field, took aggressive action in response. Not yielding to panic and drawing troops in for the immediate defense of the capital, he planned an elaborate offensive. He ordered Fr\u00e9mont to march from Franklin to Harrisonburg to engage Jackson and Ewell, to \"operate against the enemy in such a way as to relieve Banks.\"<ref>Clark, p. 146.</ref> He also sent orders to McDowell at Fredericksburg:\n\n{{Quote|You are instructed to lay aside for the present the movement on Richmond to put twenty thousand men in motion at once for the Shenandoah, moving on the line or in advance of the Manassas Gap Railroad. Your object will be to capture the forces of Jackson and Ewell, either in cooperation with General Fr\u00e9mont or in case want of supplies or of transportation interferes with his movement, it is believed that the force with which you move will be sufficient to accomplish the object alone.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 345&ndash;46.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Jackson's Valley Campaign May 21 - June 9, 1862.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|450px|Front Royal (May 23) to Port Republic (June 9)]]\n\nLincoln's plan was to spring a trap on Jackson using three armies. Fr\u00e9mont's movement to Harrisonburg would place him on Jackson's supply line. Banks would recross the Potomac and pursue Jackson if he moved up the Valley. The detachment from McDowell's corps would move to Front Royal and be positioned to attack and pursue Jackson's column as it passed by, and then to crush Jackson's army against Fr\u00e9mont's position at Harrisonburg. Unfortunately for Lincoln, his plan was complex and required synchronized movements by separate commands. McDowell was unenthusiastic about his role, wishing to retain his original mission of marching against Richmond to support McClellan, but he sent the division of Brig. Gen. James Shields, recently arrived from Banks's army, marching back to the Valley, to be followed by a second division, commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord|Edward O. C. Ord]]. But Fr\u00e9mont was the real problem for Lincoln's plan. Rather than marching east to Harrisonburg as ordered, he took note of the exceptionally difficult road conditions on Lincoln's route and marched north to [[Moorefield, West Virginia|Moorefield]]. (He also was cognizant of the enormous area his department was required to defend and he was concerned about dividing his force and abandoning his subordinate, Brig. Gen. [[Jacob D. Cox]], who had been attacked in southwestern Virginia on May 23.) But as a result, instead of a figurative hammer (Shields) striking at Jackson on an anvil (Fr\u00e9mont), all Lincoln could hope for would be a pincer movement catching Jackson at Strasburg, which would require intricate timing to succeed.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 408&ndash;15; William J. Miller (Gallagher, pp. 65&ndash;66); Clark, pp. 146&ndash;49; Salmon, p. 45.</ref>\n\nJackson received word of Shields's return march on May 26, but he had been urged by Robert E. Lee to threaten the line of the Potomac. So while the bulk of his army camped near [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], he ordered the Stonewall Brigade to demonstrate against Harpers Ferry on May 29&ndash;30. On May 30, Shields recaptured Front Royal and Jackson began moving his army back to Winchester. Lincoln's plan continued to unravel as Banks declared his army was too shaken to move in pursuit (and would remain north of the Potomac until June 10), Fr\u00e9mont moved slowly on poor roads (in contrast to Jackson, whose men had the advantage of the [[macadam]]ized Valley Pike), and Shields would not leave Front Royal until Ord's division arrived. Jackson reached Strasburg before either of the Union armies and the only source of concern was that the Stonewall Brigade had been delayed at Harpers Ferry, but it caught up with the rest of Jackson's army after noon on June 1.<ref>Clark, pp. 150&ndash;56; Eicher, p. 263; Kennedy, p. 82; Cozzens, pp. 23&ndash;25, 395&ndash;402.</ref>\n\nOn June 2, Union forces pursued Jackson&mdash;McDowell up the Luray Valley and Fr\u00e9mont up the main Valley (west of Massanutten Mountain). Jackson's men made good time on the Valley Pike, marching more than 40 miles in one 36-hour period, but heavy rains and deep mud delayed their pursuers. For the next five days, frequent clashes occurred between Turner Ashby's cavalry (screening the rear of Jackson's march) and lead Union cavalry. Ashby also burned some bridges across the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, delaying the Union pursuit and keeping Shields's and Fr\u00e9mont's forces separated. When contact was reestablished on June 6, Ashby was killed on Chestnut Ridge near Harrisonburg in a skirmish with Fr\u00e9mont's cavalry, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[George D. Bayard]]. This was a significant loss for the Confederacy since Ashby (the \"Black Knight\") was one of its most promising cavalry generals (Ashby having been promoted to brigadier general on June 3). Jackson later wrote, \"As a partisan officer, I never knew his superior.\"<ref>Eicher, p. 263; Robertson, pp. 428&ndash;29; Cozzens, pp. 424&ndash;28, 438&ndash;40; Salmon, p. 46; Krick, pp. 21, 26&ndash;32; Clark, pp. 157&ndash;58.</ref>\n\nAs the two Union armies converged at the southwestern end of Massanutten Mountain, Jackson had the option of escaping through Brown's Gap towards Charlottesville and marching to Richmond, which was closely threatened by McClellan's army. However, he was determined to finish his work in the Valley by defeating the two opposing armies in detail. To accomplish this, he recognized that the small town of [[Port Republic, Virginia|Port Republic]] would be crucial. If he could hold or destroy the bridges in this area at the confluence of the South River and North River with the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, he could prevent the two Union armies from combining against him. He positioned most of his army on the high ground overlooking the town from the south bank of the North River, from where his artillery could command the town and fords across the South River, preventing Shields from crossing. He deployed Ewell's division on a ridge about 7 miles north near the village of Cross Keys, ready to receive Fr\u00e9mont.<ref>Salmon, pp. 46&ndash;47; Robertson, pp. 430&ndash;31; Freeman, vol. 1, p. 444; Clark, pp. 158&ndash;59.</ref>\n\nOn June 7, Ewell maneuvered in an invitation for Fr\u00e9mont to attack him, but despite receiving a message from his colleague Shields, urging him to \"thunder down on [Jackson's] rear,\" Fr\u00e9mont demurred in the face of Ewell's strong position. On Sunday, June 8, Jackson hoped to avoid a fight on the Sabbath, but a raid by Shields's cavalry, commanded by Col. [[Samuel S. Carroll]], almost captured the Confederate trains in Port Republic and Jackson himself narrowly escaped by galloping over a bridge across the North River.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 443&ndash;51; Robertson, pp. 431&ndash;32; Eicher, p. 265; Krick, pp. 39&ndash;86; Salmon, p. 48; Clark, pp. 160&ndash;61.</ref>\n\n===Cross Keys (June 8)===\n{{further|Battle of Cross Keys}}\n[[File:Battle of Cross Keys map.png|thumb|Sketch of the battle-field of Cross Keys, Va., June 8, 1862, Julius Bien & Co.]]\nFr\u00e9mont moved cautiously to approach Ewell's position on the morning of June 8, assuming that he was outnumbered, although he actually outnumbered the Confederates 11,500 to 5,800. (Richard Taylor's brigade was detached from Ewell's division for service with Jackson.) His men were held up by the determined skirmishers of the 15th Alabama Infantry for over an hour and he was unable to bring up his guns until 10 a.m. His opening artillery barrage was ineffective and did little more than alert Jackson at Port Republic that the battle had started. Fr\u00e9mont's men were arranged in a line running southwest to northeast on the Keezletown Road, facing Ewell's strong position about a mile south on a ridge behind Mill Creek, with both flanks anchored by dense woods. As they advanced, they wheeled left to become roughly parallel with the Confederate line. At about noon the Federal brigade on the left, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[Julius Stahel]], chased a group of North Carolina skirmishers from Brig. Gen. [[Isaac R. Trimble]]'s brigade across a clearing and up a hill, only to be surprised by a wave of musket fire. The 500 men of the 8th New York Infantry suffered nearly 50% casualties in the engagement.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 456&ndash;64; Krick, pp. 137&ndash;81; Eicher, p. 265; Kennedy, p. 84; Salmon, p. 49; Clark, p. 164.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Cross Keys 1.png|thumb|left|The battle of Cross Keys&mdash;Sunday June 7, 1862 [sic]&mdash;Genl. Fremont and Genl. Jackson, drawing by Edwin Forbes]]\nBy mid-afternoon, Fr\u00e9mont had sent only five of his 24 regiments into battle and Ewell expected another attack. The impatient Trimble launched his own offensive against a Union battery, which took his brigade a mile in advance of the rest of Ewell's division. He and his men sat there for the rest of the afternoon, inviting an attack that never came. As Fr\u00e9mont withdrew his men back to the Keezletown Road, Ewell decided against a counterattack, knowing that his force was seriously outnumbered. Trimble proposed the idea of a night attack to both Ewell and Jackson, but neither general agreed. The Confederates merely advanced to the previous Union position, ending a battle that, considering the percentage of troops engaged, was little more than a skirmish.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 464&ndash;76; Kennedy, p. 84; Krick, pp. 183&ndash;275; Salmon, p. 49; Freeman, vol. 1, pp. 445&ndash;46; Eicher, pp. 265&ndash;66; Clark, p. 164.</ref> Union casualties were 684, Confederate only 288, although two of Ewell's brigade commanders, Brig. Gens. [[Arnold Elzey]] and [[George H. Steuart (brigadier general)|George H. Steuart]], were badly wounded.<ref>Cozzens, p. 477, Clark, p. 165, and Kennedy, p. 84; Salmon, p. 49, cites 664 Union, 287 Confederate.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isaac R. Trimble.jpg|thumb|Brig. Gen. [[Isaac R. Trimble]]]]\n\nStonewall Jackson's plan for June 9 was to concentrate his forces and overwhelm the outnumbered Shields at Port Republic. He rightly assumed that Fr\u00e9mont would be too shaken to launch a major attack and that he could be held at bay with a mere token force, so he ordered the majority of Ewell's division to withdraw under the cover of darkness. They slipped away from Fr\u00e9mont and crossed the North River bridge. A hastily constructed bridge across the South River allowed the Confederates to move into the foggy, flat bottomland below the south bank of the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. The Stonewall Brigade led the advance on the road to Conrad's Store, the direction from which Shields would be approaching. Also that morning, Jackson ordered his trains to begin a march into Brown's Gap.<ref>Krick, pp. 277&ndash;95; Freeman, vol. 1, p. 448; Salmon, p. 50; Clark, p. 165; Krick, p. 470.</ref>\n\n===Port Republic (June 9)===\n{{further|Battle of Port Republic}}\n[[File:Port Republic.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Battle of Port Republic]]\nJackson learned at 7 a.m. that the Federals were approaching his column. Without proper reconnaissance or waiting for the bulk of his force to come up, he ordered Winder's Stonewall Brigade to charge through the thinning fog. The brigade was caught between artillery on its flank and rifle volleys to its front and fell back in disarray. They had run into two brigades at the vanguard of Shields's army, 3,000 men under Brig. Gen. [[Erastus B. Tyler]]. Attempting to extricate himself from a potential disaster, Jackson realized that the Union artillery fire was coming from a spur of the Blue Ridge that was known locally as the Coaling, where charcoal was made by a local family for their blacksmith shop. Jackson and Winder sent the [[2nd Virginia Infantry|2nd]] and [[4th Virginia Infantry]] regiments through the thick underbrush up the hill, where they encountered three Union infantry regiments supporting the artillery and were repulsed.<ref>Salmon, p. 51; Clark, pp. 167&ndash;68; Cozzens, pp. 480&ndash;84; Krick, pp. 355&ndash;90; Kennedy, p. 85.</ref>\n\nAfter his assault on the Coaling failed, Jackson ordered the rest of Ewell's division, primarily Trimble's brigade, to cross over the North River bridge and burn it behind them, keeping Fr\u00e9mont's men isolated to the north of the River. While he waited for these troops to arrive, Jackson reinforced his line with the 7th Louisiana Infantry of Taylor's brigade and ordered Taylor to make another attempt against the Union batteries. Winder perceived that the Federals were about to attack, so he ordered a preemptive charge, but in the face of point-blank volleys and running low on ammunition, the Stonewall Brigade was routed. At this point, Ewell arrived on the battlefield and ordered the [[44th Virginia Infantry|44th]] and [[58th Virginia Infantry]] regiments to strike the left flank of the advancing Union battle line. Tyler's men fell back, but reorganized and drove Ewell's men into the forest south of the Coaling.<ref>Clark, pp. 168&ndash;69; Cozzens, pp. 484&ndash;91; Krick, pp. 391&ndash;417; Salmon, pp. 51&ndash;53; Kennedy, p. 87.</ref>\n\nTaylor attacked the infantry and artillery on the Coaling three times before prevailing, but having achieved their objective, were faced by a new charge from three Ohio regiments. It was only the surprise appearance by Ewell's troops that convinced Tyler to withdraw his men. The Confederates began bombarding the Union troops on the flat lands, with Ewell himself gleefully manning one of the cannons. More Confederate reinforcements began to arrive, including the brigade of Brig. Gen. [[William B. Taliaferro]], and the Union army reluctantly began to withdraw. Jackson remarked to Ewell, \"General, he who does not see the hand of God in this is blind, sir, blind.\"<ref>Clark, 169&ndash;70; Eicher, p. 266; Cozzens, pp. 491&ndash;97; Krick, pp. 419&ndash;58; Kennedy, p. 87; Salmon, pp. 53&ndash;54.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=The impetuosity of Jackson had betrayed him into attacking before his troops were sufficiently massed, which was made difficult by the insufficient means of crossing the river.\n|source=Brig.

Eicher, p. 266, also gives combined casualties: Confederate 1,150 (139 killed, 951 wounded, and 60 missing or captured), Union 1,702 (181 killed, 836 wounded, and 685 missing or captured).</ref> Historian Peter Cozzens blames Jackson's piecemeal deployment of troops for his heavy losses and argues that it was a battle that did not need to have been fought&mdash;the Confederates could have easily burned the North River bridge and slipped into the Blue Ridge via Brown's Gap Turnpike without losses.<ref>Cozzens, p. 499.</ref> Union soldiers were particularly upset with the performance of their commanders, Shields and Fr\u00e9mont, and both of their military careers faded. Fr\u00e9mont resigned his command  just weeks later, rather than be subordinated to his rival Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]. While residing in [[New York City|New York]], Fr\u00e9mont resigned his commission in June 1864.

Fr\u00e9mont marched back to Harrisonburg, where he was frustrated to find orders from Lincoln he had not received in time, telling him not to advance beyond that town against Jackson. As the weather became clear, Jackson's cavalry under Col. [[Thomas T. Munford]] harassed Fr\u00e9mont's withdrawal, which reached Mount Jackson on June 11, and then unencumbered to Middletown on June 14 where he joined with Banks and Brig. Gen. [[Franz Sigel]]. Shields, who complained bitterly about the exhaustion of his division, marched slowly to Front Royal and on June 21 marched across the Blue Ridge to join Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]].<ref>Cozzens, pp. 502&ndash;504.</ref>\n\nJackson sent messages to Richmond requesting that his force be augmented to 40,000 men so that he could assume the offensive down the Valley and across the Potomac. Lee sent him about 14,000 reinforcements, but then revealed his plan to call Jackson to Richmond to counterattack McClellan's Army of the Potomac and drive it away from Richmond. He needed all of the combat power he could muster and he wanted Jackson to attack the relatively unprotected right flank of McClellan's army, north of the [[Chickahominy River]]. Shortly after midnight on June 18, Jackson's men began to march toward the [[Virginia Peninsula]]. They fought with Lee in the [[Seven Days Battles]], from June 25 to July 1. Jackson delivered an uncharacteristically lethargic performance in many of those battles, perhaps because of the physical strains of the Valley campaign and the exhausting march to Richmond.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 504&ndash;12; Salmon, p. 64; Robert E. L. Krick (Gallagher, p. 204).</ref>\n\nWith the success of his Valley campaign, Stonewall Jackson became the most celebrated soldier in the Confederacy (until his reputation was eventually eclipsed by Lee's), and his victories lifted the morale of the public. In a classic military campaign of surprise and maneuver, he pressed his army to travel 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days of marching and won five significant victories with a force of about 17,000 against a combined force of over 50,000. Jackson had accomplished his difficult mission, causing Washington to withhold over 40,000 troops from McClellan's offensive.<ref>Freeman, vol. 1, pp. 485&ndash;86; Eicher, p. 266; Salmon, p. 64; Gallagher, p. xi.</ref> Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones summarized a successful campaign:\n\n{{Quote|Always outnumbered seven to three, every time Jackson engaged he fought with the odds of about four to three in his favor&mdash;because, moving rapidly on interior lines, he hit fractions of his enemy with the bulk of his own command. ... Jackson enjoyed the great advantage that the northerners remained widely scattered on a perimeter within which his troops could maneuver to concentrate against first one and then another of the Union forces. Lincoln managed very well, personally maneuvering the scattered Union armies. Since neither Lincoln nor his advisers felt that Jackson's small force could truly threaten Washington, they chose an offensive response as they sought to exploit their overwhelming forces and exterior position to overwhelm his army. But Jackson's great ability, celerity of movement, and successful series of small fights determined the outcome.|Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones, ''How the North Won''<ref>Hattaway and Jones, p. 176.</ref>}}\n\nOn the Union side, a command shakeup resulted from the embarrassing defeat by a smaller force. McDowell's corps remained in the defense of Washington, with only one division (under Brig. Gen. [[George A. McCall]]) able to join McClellan on the Peninsula. Lincoln was disillusioned by the command difficulties of controlling multiple forces in this campaign and created a single new army, the [[Army of Virginia]], under Maj. Gen. John Pope, incorporating the units of Banks, Fr\u00e9mont, McDowell, and several smaller ones from around Washington and western Virginia. This army was soundly defeated by Lee and Jackson in August at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] during the [[northern Virginia campaign]].<ref>Eicher, pp. 317&ndash;18; Salmon, pp. 126&ndash;31.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n* Clark, Champ, and the Editors of Time-Life Books.

Investing in new technology research is imperative in providing answers for the following topics: efficiency, storage and variability. Regarding photovoltaic technology, efficiency plays a part in its capacity to be a part of the transition.

Among the most important drivers are the acknowledgment of the energy system\u2019s impact on climate change, as well as the diminishing resources that threaten [[energy security]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Climate change]] can be attributed to the use of [[Fossil fuel energy|fossil fuel energy]] and the contribution of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This increased level of greenhouse gas emissions creates adverse effects on a changing climate such as increased intensity and frequency of natural disasters.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trenberth|first=Kevin|date=2015|title=Attribution of climate extreme events|url=http://www.theurbanclimatologist.com/uploads/4/4/2/5/44250401/attributionextremeevents.pdf|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=5|issue=8|pages=725\u2013730|via=|doi=10.1038/nclimate2657|bibcode=2015NatCC...5..725T}}</ref> The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] has said with high certainty that society has 12 years to complete an entire transition to avoid catastrophic climate change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_SPM_version_report_LR.pdf|title=Summary for Policy Makers|last=|first=|date=2019|website=IPCC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This reality has motivated the conversation of a renewable energy transition as a mitigation tactic.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry faces risk completely separate from the impacts of climate change. Fossil fuels are a limited resource and are at risk of reaching a peak in which diminishing returns will become prevalent.<ref name=\"Mishra 337\u2013350\"/> Uncertainty with the supply of this resource questions the security of the industry and the investments in fossil fuel companies. Companies such as Blackrock are evaluating these risks and determining their desire level of involvement with the industry as a result.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter|title=Larry Fink's Letter to CEOs|website=BlackRock|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> These driving conversations are motivating organizations to reconsider the future of the energy sector.\n\n== Technologies ==\n\n=== Wind energy ===\n[[Wind power|Wind energy]] is a viable form of renewable energy, as wind is abundant and inexhaustible. Its use produces no toxic pollution nor greenhouse gas emissions. There is enough wind on Earth and in the atmosphere which could be transformed into energy to easily power the planet- we could capture more than 20 times the 18 terawatts of energy that the global population uses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidescience.org/news/studies-show-wind-powers-massive-potential|title=Studies Show Wind Power's Massive Potential|date=2012-09-10|website=Inside Science|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Wind turbines themselves are very space efficient, as one turbine can generate enough electricity to power 600 U.S. homes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/wind-power/|title=Wind Power|date=2009-10-09|website=National Geographic|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Wind energy is also becoming more affordable, as prices have decreased over 80% since 1980 and are expected to keep decreasing. The operational costs associated with wind power are also low.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/advantages-and-challenges-wind-energy|title=Advantages and Challenges of Wind Energy|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nHowever, conflicts can arise concerning land use, as the wind turbines use between 30 and 141 acres per megawatt of power output capacity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Denholm|first=P.|date=2009|title=Land-use requirements of modern wind power plants in the United States|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy09osti/45834.pdf|journal=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Some opponents of wind energy argue that the land could be better used, although the land can still be used for grazing livestock, agriculture, and highways. Another issue regarding wind energy concerns the disturbance to wildlife. Many studies have been done to assess the impact of wind turbines on bird and bat populations, and the disturbance of [[wind turbine]]s has been found to be relatively low and does not pose a threat to species population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.eere.energy.gov/wind/pdfs/birds_and_bats_fact_sheet.pdf|title=Wind turbine interactions with birds, bats, and their habitats: A summary of research results and priority questions|last=|first=|date=2010|website=National Wind Coordinating Committee|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Solar energy ===\n[[File:Solar panels in the desert.jpg|thumb|Photovoltaic array at the Mesa Verde Visitor and Research Center in Montezuma County, Colorado. This site uses 95% renewable energy and is an example of the renewable energy transition occurring.]]\n\nSolar energy is another commonly used renewable energy source. It could provide well over the energy needed to power our world- the surface of the earth receives 120,000 terawatts of solar radiation, which is 20,000 times more power than what is needed to supply the entire world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/maps/solar-energy-potential|title=Solar Energy Potential|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Solar power can be used to generate electricity in places that lack a grid connection, such as distilling water in Africa, or even to power satellites in space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lightingafrica.org/about/why-off-grid-energy/|title=Benefits of Off-Grid Solar Products|website=Lighting Africa|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> There are no moving parts involved in most applications of solar power, leading to no noise associated with photovoltaic panels. This compares favorable to certain other green-techs such as wind turbines.\n\nUnfortunately, solar energy still comes with a few drawbacks. Similarly to wind energy, land use is a concern. However, solar panels can be placed on rooftops and in this case they do not take up space that could have been used for something more productive. Panels can also be placed at low quality locations such as brownfields, abandoned mining land, or existing transportation and transmission corridors. The manufacturing of solar panels also has some negative impacts. They require a significant amount of water to be produced, but dry-cooling technology can reduce water use at manufacturing plants by approximately 90 percent.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Hand|first=M.M.|date=2012|title=Renewable Electricity Futures Study|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/52409-4.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|volume=4|id=NREL/TP-6A20-52409|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Geothermal energy ===\nGeothermal energy is another type of viable and increasingly common renewable energy source.The process of obtaining this energy is emission free- there is absolutely zero carbon used when it comes to the production of this type of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geothermal-faqs|title=Geothermal FAQs|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> The procedure can clean out sulfur that may have generally been discharged from other processes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://amsainc.com/geothermal/|title=Sulfur deposit cleaning and prevention in geothermal cooling towers in power plants|last=Codeart.mk|website=AMSA, Inc.|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Geothermal energy has the smallest land footprint of any major energy source in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/pros-and-cons-of-geothermal-energy.php|title=Pros and Cons of Geothermal Energy|last=Rinkesh|date=2015-01-19|website=Conserve Energy Future|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nWater is also used in obtaining this type of energy. Depending on the cooling technology used, geothermal plants can require between 1,700 and 4,000 gallons of water per megawatt-hour of energy produced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/how-geothermal-power-plant-works-simple|title=How a Geothermal Power Plant Works (Simple)|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> However, most geothermal plants can use either geothermal fluid or freshwater for cooling, and using the prior has a significantly lesser environmental impact. There are both open-looped and close-looped geothermal systems, and open-loop systems emit small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane, and boron.<ref>{{Cite document|url=|title=A Guide to Geothermal Energy and the Environment|last=Kagel|first=A.|date=2007|website=Geothermal Energy Association|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Hydroelectric energy ===\n[[File:Gold ray dam.jpg|thumb|Gold Ray Dam on the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] upstream of [[Gold Hill, Oregon|Gold Hill]] in the U.S. state of Oregon.

Flooding land for a hydroelectric reservoir has a significant environmental impact, as it destroys forest, wildlife habitat, agricultural land, and scenic lands.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/land-under-water-estimating-hydropowers-land-use-impacts/|title=Land Under Water: Estimating Hydropower\u2019s Land Use Impacts \u00ab Landsat Science|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> There is also a significant impact on wildlife. Fish and other organisms can be injured and killed by turbine blades.<ref name=\":1\" /> Aside from direct contact, there are also wildlife impacts within the dammed reservoirs and downstream from the facility. Reservoirs will have above average amounts of sediments and nutrients, which can cultivate an excess of algae and lead to [[eutrophication]]. In addition, reservoirs are required to release a certain amount of water every year to prevent rivers downstream from drying up, which would be detrimental to those ecosystems.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Tidal energy ===\nTidal energy utilizes the gravitational and kinetic energy of large bodies of water. The physical push and pull of the tides causes a turbine to spin, and that turbine converts the water's movement into electricity.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.renewableresourcescoalition.org/tidal-energy/|title=Tidal Energy: What is it, Pros & Cons, Future Development {{!}} 2020's Guide|date=2019-12-11|website=Renewable Resources Coalition|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> This form of renewable energy produces no pollution, and takes up little physical space when compared to other forms of renewable energy. It is predictable and reliable form of energy, as most water bodies experience two high tides and two low tides per day. This cycle is easily predicted and isn\u2019t subject to unexpected changes unlike many other renewable resources. Some systems also harvest energy from tidal currents regardless of which direction they are flowing, allowing the production of energy to go completely uninterrupted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/tidal-energy|title=Tidal Energy - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> The equipment used is long lasting, with an average lifespan of 75-100 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.power-technology.com/features/tidal-energy-advantages-and-disadvantages/|title=Tidal energy advantages and disadvantages: key points to consider|date=2018-10-26|website=Power Technology {{!}} Energy News and Market Analysis|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \n\nHowever, some cons do exist. The systems require turbulent water to power them, meaning a large foundation needs to be built, which can result in habitat destruction. The greatest offender is the tidal barrage system which utilizes dams that can impede the movement of sea life and potentially wreak havoc on aquatic ecosystems.<ref name=\":2\" /> Tidal energy systems also have a high upfront cost. Although they have long lifespans and eventually pay themselves off, governments are more concerned with their 5-year budget rather than a 60-year projection.<ref>{{Cite report |last=Kempener|first=Ruud |first2=Frank |last2=Neumann |date=2014 |title=Tidal Energy Technology Brief |url=https://www.irena.org/documentdownloads/publications/tidal_energy_v4_web.pdf |publisher=IRENA}}</ref>\n\n=== Nuclear Energy ===\nThere has been a [[Nuclear power debate|debate]] around whether nuclear energy is considered renewable or not.

However, solar panels can be placed on rooftops and in this case they do not take up space that could have been used for something more productive. Panels can also be placed at low quality locations such as brownfields, abandoned mining land, or existing transportation and transmission corridors. The manufacturing of solar panels also has some negative impacts.
