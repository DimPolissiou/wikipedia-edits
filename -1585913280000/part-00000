It was the first in a [[trilogy]], followed by ''Thunderhead'' (1943) and ''Green Grass of Wyoming'' (1946). The popular [[My Friend Flicka (film)|1943 film version]] featured young [[Roddy McDowall]] and was followed by two other film adaptations, ''[[Thunderhead, Son of Flicka]]'' (1945), and ''[[Green Grass of Wyoming]]'' (1948), both based on O'Hara's novels. A [[My Friend Flicka (TV series)|television series]] followed during 1956-1957, that first aired on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]], then on [[NBC]], with reruns on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and on CBS between 1959 and 1966. [[The Disney Channel]] re-ran the program during the mid-1980s, too.\n\n==Plot summary==\nKenneth McLaughlin is a 10-year-old boy living on Goose Bar Ranch, just out of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], with his practical father, Rob; his mother, Nell; and his older brother, Howard. Rob is often unsatisfied with Ken, who daydreams when he should be attending to practical matters; Nell, however, shares her son's sensitive nature and is more sympathetic. Howard, the older son, who looks and acts more like Rob, was allowed to choose and train a colt from among the Goose Bar herd (thoroughbreds that Rob McLaughlin is raising in the old-fashioned way, on the open range), much to the jealousy of Ken. Although Ken loves horses, Rob doesn't think his wool-gathering son deserves such a privilege yet.\n\n[[Image:Remount ranch.jpg|thumb|upright|The room on the Remount Ranch outside [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]] where Mary O'Hara wrote ''My Friend Flicka''.

This publication was produced as part of a marketing package to sell the 1,766-acre ranch.</ref>]]\n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Ken has angered his father by returning home from boarding school with failing grades and will have to repeat fifth grade, an expense Rob can ill afford. After a few mishaps in his first few days home, Nell convinces Rob to give Ken a colt, saying it will give him something to work towards and improve himself and his sense of responsibility. Ken is unable to decide which yearling he wants until he sees a beautiful [[sorrel (horse)|sorrel]] filly running swiftly away from him.\n\nRob, once again, is annoyed with his son; this particular filly has a strain of [[mustang]] blood that makes her very wild &ndash; \"loco\", in ranch idiom.  The mustang blood comes from a wild horse called the Albino, named for his pure white coat. All the Goose Bar horses with this strain have been fast and beautiful, but untameable, and after many years of trying to [[Horse training|break]] just one of them, Rob has decided to get rid of them all. Ken persists, however, and Rob reluctantly agrees to let him have the filly. Rob, Ken, and the ranch hands make two attempts to capture her. During the second attempt, she tries to escape by attempting to jump an impossibly high [[barbed wire]] fence and injures herself severely.\n\nKen spends the rest of the summer nursing the filly. He names her Flicka &ndash; Swedish for \"little girl\" &ndash; and spends hours every day tending to her needs and keeping her company. Flicka comes to love and trust the boy, but her wounds fester and cause a dangerous [[Blood poisoning|blood infection]], still young Ken perseveres in his care of her.  During this time, he writes his overdue essay well enough to convince his fifth-grade English teacher to promote him to the next grade.  Unfortunately Flicka grows so thin and weak that Rob decides she must be shot to put her out of her misery. The night before the order is to be carried out, Flicka wades into a shallow brook, falls, and is unable to rise. Ken sneaks from the house and spends the night sitting on the bank of the stream, with his legs in the cold water, holding her head to prevent her from drowning. When he is found the next morning, he has developed chills then a high fever but Flicka was alive.  As the days pass, Ken's fever turns to pneumonia, and his condition continues downhill. On the other hand, Flicka gains strength steadily. By the end of the book, Ken has not only regained sufficient health to return to school he learns that his beloved horse is alive.\n\n==Adaptations==\n;Films\n*''[[My Friend Flicka (film)|My Friend Flicka]]'' (1943), a [[20th Century Fox]] film directed by [[Harold D.

{"title_page": "Idiom", "text_new": "{{short description|Combination of words that has a figurative meaning}}\n{{about||the structural nature particular to a language|Idiom (language structure)|other uses}}\n{{English grammar}}\nAn '''idiom''' is a [[phrase]] or expression that typically presents a [[figurative language|figurative]], non-literal [[meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] attached to the phrase; but some phrases become figurative idioms while retaining the literal meaning of the phrase. Categorized as [[formulaic speech|formulaic language]], an idiom's figurative meaning is different from the [[Literal and figurative language|literal]] meaning.<ref>The Oxford companion to the English language (1992:495f.)</ref> Idioms occur frequently in all languages; in [[English language|English]] alone there are an estimated twenty-five thousand idiomatic expressions.<ref>Jackendoff (1997).</ref>\n\n==Derivations==\nMany idiomatic expressions were meant literally in their original use, but sometimes, the attribution of the literal meaning changed and the phrase itself grew away from its original roots\u2014typically leading to a [[folk etymology]]. For instance, the literal ''spill the beans'' (meaning to reveal a secret) apparently originated from an ancient method of voting, wherein a voter deposited a bean into one of several cups, indicating  the candidate they favored. If jars were spilled before the counting of votes was complete, one might see which jar had more beans and thereby could claim which candidate might be the winner. Over time, the 'bean jar' voting method fell out of favor but the idiom persisted and became figurative.\n\nOther idioms are deliberately figurative. For example, ''[[break a leg]]'' is an [[irony|ironic]] expression to wish a person good luck just prior to their giving a performance or presentation. It may have arisen from the superstition that one ought not utter the words \"good luck\" to an actor because it was believed that doing so caused the opposite result.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/break-a-leg.html |title=Break a leg |author=Gary Martin |publisher=The Phrase Finder}}</ref>\n\n==Compositionality==\n[[File:Donato Barcaglia, Liebe macht blind, Ausschnitt.jpg|thumb|''Love is blind'']]\n\nIn [[linguistics]], idioms are usually presumed to be [[figures of speech]] contradicting the [[principle of compositionality]]. That compositionality is the key notion for the analysis of idioms is emphasized in most accounts of idioms.<ref>Radford (2004:187f.)</ref><ref>Portner (2005:33f).</ref> This principle states that the meaning of a whole should be constructed from the meanings of the parts that make up the whole. In other words, one should be in a position to understand the whole if one understands the meanings of each of the parts that make up the whole. The following example is widely employed to illustrate the point:\n\n{{quote|Fred '''kicked the bucket'''.}}\n\nUnderstood compositionally, Fred has literally kicked an actual, physical bucket. The much more likely idiomatic reading, however, is non-compositional: Fred is understood to have died. Arriving at the idiomatic reading from the literal reading is unlikely for most speakers. What this means is that the idiomatic reading is, rather, stored as a single [[lexical item]] that is now largely independent of the literal reading.\n\nIn [[phraseology]], idioms are defined as a sub-type of [[Phraseme#Non-compositional phrasemes: Idioms|phraseme]], the meaning of which is not the regular sum of the meanings of its component parts.<ref>Mel\u2019\u010duk (1995:167\u2013232).</ref> John Saeed defines an idiom as [[collocation|collocated]] words that became affixed to each other until metamorphosing into a [[Fossilization (linguistics)|fossilised term]].<ref>For Saeed's definition, see Saeed (2003:60).</ref> This collocation of words redefines each component word in the [[word-group]] and becomes an ''idiomatic expression''. Idioms usually do not translate well; in some cases, when an idiom is translated directly word-for-word into another language, either its meaning is changed or it is meaningless.\n\nWhen two or three words are often used together in a particular sequence, the words are said to be irreversible binomials, or [[Siamese twins (linguistics)|Siamese twins]]. Usage will prevent the words from being displaced or rearranged. For example, a person may be left \"high and dry\" but never \"dry and high\". This idiom in turn means that the person is left in their former condition rather than being assisted so that their condition improves. Not all Siamese twins are idioms, however. \"Chips and dip\" is an irreversible binomial, but it refers to literal food items, not idiomatic ones.\n\n== Mobility ==\nIdioms possess varying degrees of mobility. Whereas some idioms are used only in a routine form, others can undergo syntactic modifications such as passivization, raising constructions, and [[clefting]], demonstrating separable constituencies within the idiom.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Horn|first=George|year=2003|title=Idioms, Metaphors, and Syntactic Mobility|url=|journal=Journal of Linguistics|volume=39|pages=245\u2013273}}</ref> ''Mobile idioms'', allowing such movement, maintain their idiomatic meaning where ''fixed idioms'' do not:\n;Mobile: ''I spilled the beans on our project.'' \u2192 ''The beans were spilled on our project.''\n;Fixed: ''The old man kicked the bucket.'' \u2192 ''The bucket was kicked'' (by the old man).\nMany fixed idioms lack ''semantic composition'', meaning that the idiom contains the semantic role of a verb, but not of any object. This is true of ''kick the bucket'', which means ''die''. By contrast, the semantically composite idiom ''spill the beans'', meaning ''reveal a secret'', contains both a semantic verb and object, ''reveal'' and ''secret''. Semantically composite idioms have a syntactic similarity between their surface and semantic forms.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe types of movement allowed for certain idiom also relate to the degree to which the literal reading of the idiom has a connection to its idiomatic meaning. This is referred to as ''motivation'' or ''transparency''. While most idioms that do not display semantic composition generally do not allow non-adjectival modification, those that are also motivated allow lexical substitution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keizer|first=Evelien|year=2016|title=Idiomatic expressions in Functional Discourse Grammar|url=|journal=Linguistics|volume=54|pages=981\u20131016|via=}}</ref> For example, ''oil the wheels'' and ''grease the wheels'' allow variation for nouns that elicit a similar literal meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mostafa|first=Massrura|year=2010|title=Variation in V+the+N idioms|url=|journal=English Today|volume=26|pages=37\u201343|via=}}</ref> These types of changes can occur only when speakers can easily recognize a connection between what the idiom is meant to express and its literal meaning, thus an idiom like ''kick the bucket'' cannot occur as ''kick the pot''.\n\nFrom the perspective of [[dependency grammar]], idioms are represented as a [[catena (linguistics)|catena]] which cannot be interrupted by non-idiomatic content. Although syntactic modifications introduce disruptions to the idiomatic structure, this continuity is only required for idioms as lexical entries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O'Grady|first=William|year=1998|title=The Syntax of Idioms|url=|journal=Natural Language and Linguistic Theory|volume=16|pages=279\u2013312|via=}}</ref>\n\nCertain idioms, allowing unrestricted syntactic modification, can be said to be metaphors. Expressions such as ''jump on the bandwagon'', ''pull strings'', and ''draw the line'' all represent their meaning independently in their verbs and objects, making them compositional. In the idiom ''jump on the bandwagon'', ''jump on'' involves joining something and a 'bandwagon' can refer to a collective cause, regardless of context.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Translating idioms==\nA [[literal translation|literal word-by-word translation]] of an opaque idiom will most likely not convey the same meaning in other languages. The English idiom ''kick the bucket'' has a variety of equivalents in other languages, such as ''kopn\u0105\u0107 w kalendarz'' (\"kick the calendar\") in Polish, ''casser sa pipe'' (\"to break his pipe\") in French<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.idiommaster.com/search/en-fr?search-term=kick+the+bucket |title=Translation of the idiom kick the bucket in French |publisher=www.idiommaster.com |date= |accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref> and ''tirare le cuoia'' (\"pulling the leathers\") in Italian.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.idiommaster.com/search/en-it?search-term=kick+the+bucket |title=Translation of the idiom kick the bucket in Italian |publisher=www.idiommaster.com |date= |accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref>\n\nSome idioms are transparent.<ref>Gibbs, R. W. (1987)</ref> Much of their meaning does get through if they are taken (or translated) literally. For example, ''lay one's cards on the table'' meaning to reveal previously unknown intentions, or to reveal a secret. Transparency is a matter of degree; ''spill the beans'' (to let secret information become known) and ''leave no stone unturned'' (to do everything possible in order to achieve or find something) are not entirely literally interpretable, but only involve a slight metaphorical broadening. Another category of idioms is a word having several meanings, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes discerned from the context of its usage. This is seen in the (mostly uninflected) [[English language]] in [[polysemes]], the common use of the same word for an activity, for those engaged in it, for the product used, for the place or time of an activity, and sometimes for a [[verb]].\n\nIdioms tend to confuse those unfamiliar with them; students of a new language must learn its idiomatic expressions as vocabulary. Many [[natural language]] words have ''idiomatic origins'', but are assimilated, so losing their figurative senses, for example, in Portuguese, the expression ''saber de cora\u00e7\u00e3o'' 'to know by heart', with the same meaning as in English, was shortened to 'saber de cor', and, later, to the verb ''decorar'', meaning ''memorize''.\n\nIn 2015, [[TED (conference)|TED]] collected 40 examples of bizarre idioms that cannot be translated literally. They include the Swedish saying \"to slide in on a shrimp sandwich\", which refers to somebody who didn't have to work to get where they are.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/40-idioms-that-cant-be-translated-literally/|title=40 brilliant idioms that simply can\u2019t be translated literally|website=TED Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-08}}</ref>\n\nConversely, idioms may be shared between multiple languages. For example, the Arabic phrase \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0643\u0628 (fi nafs al-markab) is translated as \"in the same boat,\" and it carries the same figurative meaning as the equivalent idiom in English.\n\nAccording to German linguist Elizabeth Piirainen, the idiom \"to get on one's nerves\" has the same figurative meaning in 57 European languages. She also says that the phrase \"to shed crocodile tears,\"\u2014meaning to express insincere sorrow\u2014is similarly widespread in European languages, but is also used in Arabic, Swahili, Persian, Chinese, Mongolian, and several others.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe origin of cross-language idioms is uncertain. One theory is that cross-language idioms are a [[language contact]] phenomenon, resulting from a word-for-word translation called a [[calque]]. Piirainen says that this may happen as a result of [[lingua franca]] usage; speakers incorporate expressions from their own native tongue, exposing them to speakers of other languages. Other theories suggest they come from a shared ancestor language or that humans are naturally predisposed to develop certain metaphors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Dealing with non-compositionality==\nThe non-compositionality of meaning of idioms challenges theories of syntax. The fixed words of many idioms do not qualify as [[constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] in any sense. For example:\n\n{{quote|How do we '''get to the bottom of''' this situation?}}\n\nThe fixed words of this idiom (in bold) do not form a constituent in any theory's analysis of syntactic structure because the object of the preposition (here ''this situation'') is not part of the idiom (but rather it is an [[argument (linguistics)|argument]] of the idiom). One can know that it is not part of the idiom because it is variable; for example, ''How do we get to the bottom of this situation / the claim / the phenomenon / her statement /'' etc. What this means is that theories of syntax that take the constituent to be the fundamental unit of syntactic analysis are challenged. The manner in which units of meaning are assigned to units of syntax remains unclear. This problem has motivated a tremendous amount of discussion and debate in linguistics circles and it is a primary motivator behind the [[Construction Grammar]] framework.<ref>Culicver and Jackendoff (2005:32ff.)</ref>\n\nA relatively recent development in the syntactic analysis of idioms departs from a constituent-based account of syntactic structure, preferring instead the [[catena (linguistics)|catena]]-based account. The catena unit was introduced to linguistics by William O'Grady in 1998. Any word or any combination of words that are linked together by dependencies qualifies as a catena.<ref>Osborne and Gro\u00df (2012:173ff.)</ref> The words constituting idioms are stored as catenae in the lexicon, and as such, they are concrete units of syntax. The [[dependency grammar]] trees of a few sentences containing non-constituent idioms illustrate the point:\n\n::[[File:Idiom trees 1'.png|Idiom trees 1']]\n\nThe fixed words of the idiom (in orange) in each case are linked together by dependencies; they form a catena. The material that is outside of the idiom (in normal black script) is not part of the idiom. The following two trees illustrate proverbs:\n\n::[[File:Idiom trees 2.png|Idiom trees 2]]\n\nThe fixed words of the proverbs (in orange) again form a catena each time. The adjective ''nitty-gritty'' and the adverb ''always'' are not part of the respective proverb and their appearance does not interrupt the fixed words of the proverb. A caveat concerning the catena-based analysis of idioms concerns their status in the lexicon. Idioms are lexical items, which means they are stored as catenae in the lexicon. In the actual syntax, however, some idioms can be broken up by various functional constructions.\n\nThe catena-based analysis of idioms provides a basis for an understanding of meaning compositionality.

Categorized as [[formulaic speech|formulaic language]], an idiom's figurative meaning is different from the [[Literal and figurative language|literal]] meaning.<ref>The Oxford companion to the English language (1992:495f.)</ref> Idioms occur frequently in all languages; in [[English language|English]] alone there are an estimated twenty-five thousand idiomatic expressions.<ref>Jackendoff (1997).</ref>\n\n==Derivations==\nMany idiomatic expressions were meant literally in their original use, but sometimes, the attribution of the literal meaning changed and the phrase itself grew away from its original roots\u2014typically leading to a [[folk etymology]]. For instance, the literal ''spill the beans'' (meaning to reveal a secret) apparently originated from an ancient method of voting, wherein a voter deposited a bean into one of several cups, indicating  the candidate they favored. If jars were spilled before the counting of votes was complete, one might see which jar had more beans and thereby could claim which candidate might be the winner. Over time, the 'bean jar' voting method fell out of favor but the idiom persisted and became figurative.\n\nOther idioms are deliberately figurative. For example, ''[[break a leg]]'' is an [[irony|ironic]] expression to wish a person good luck just prior to their giving a performance or presentation. It may have arisen from the superstition that one ought not utter the words \"good luck\" to an actor because it was believed that doing so caused the opposite result.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/break-a-leg.html |title=Break a leg |author=Gary Martin |publisher=The Phrase Finder}}</ref>\n\n==Compositionality==\n[[File:Donato Barcaglia, Liebe macht blind, Ausschnitt.jpg|thumb|''Love is blind'']]\n\nIn [[linguistics]], idioms are usually presumed to be [[figures of speech]] contradicting the [[principle of compositionality]]. That compositionality is the key notion for the analysis of idioms is emphasized in most accounts of idioms.<ref>Radford (2004:187f.)</ref><ref>Portner (2005:33f).</ref> This principle states that the meaning of a whole should be constructed from the meanings of the parts that make up the whole. In other words, one should be in a position to understand the whole if one understands the meanings of each of the parts that make up the whole. The following example is widely employed to illustrate the point:\n\n{{quote|Fred '''kicked the bucket'''.}}\n\nUnderstood compositionally, Fred has literally kicked an actual, physical bucket. The much more likely idiomatic reading, however, is non-compositional: Fred is understood to have died. Arriving at the idiomatic reading from the literal reading is unlikely for most speakers. What this means is that the idiomatic reading is, rather, stored as a single [[lexical item]] that is now largely independent of the literal reading.\n\nIn [[phraseology]], idioms are defined as a sub-type of [[Phraseme#Non-compositional phrasemes: Idioms|phraseme]], the meaning of which is not the regular sum of the meanings of its component parts.<ref>Mel\u2019\u010duk (1995:167\u2013232).</ref> John Saeed defines an idiom as [[collocation|collocated]] words that became affixed to each other until metamorphosing into a [[Fossilization (linguistics)|fossilised term]].<ref>For Saeed's definition, see Saeed (2003:60).</ref> This collocation of words redefines each component word in the [[word-group]] and becomes an ''idiomatic expression''. Idioms usually do not translate well; in some cases, when an idiom is translated directly word-for-word into another language, either its meaning is changed or it is meaningless.\n\nWhen two or three words are often used together in a particular sequence, the words are said to be irreversible binomials, or [[Siamese twins (linguistics)|Siamese twins]]. Usage will prevent the words from being displaced or rearranged. For example, a person may be left \"high and dry\" but never \"dry and high\". This idiom in turn means that the person is left in their former condition rather than being assisted so that their condition improves. Not all Siamese twins are idioms, however. \"Chips and dip\" is an irreversible binomial, but it refers to literal food items, not idiomatic ones.\n\n== Mobility ==\nIdioms possess varying degrees of mobility. Whereas some idioms are used only in a routine form, others can undergo syntactic modifications such as passivization, raising constructions, and [[clefting]], demonstrating separable constituencies within the idiom.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Horn|first=George|year=2003|title=Idioms, Metaphors, and Syntactic Mobility|url=|journal=Journal of Linguistics|volume=39|pages=245\u2013273}}</ref> ''Mobile idioms'', allowing such movement, maintain their idiomatic meaning where ''fixed idioms'' do not:\n;Mobile: ''I spilled the beans on our project.'' \u2192 ''The beans were spilled on our project.''\n;Fixed: ''The old man kicked the bucket.'' \u2192 ''The bucket was kicked'' (by the old man).\nMany fixed idioms lack ''semantic composition'', meaning that the idiom contains the semantic role of a verb, but not of any object. This is true of ''kick the bucket'', which means ''die''. By contrast, the semantically composite idiom ''spill the beans'', meaning ''reveal a secret'', contains both a semantic verb and object, ''reveal'' and ''secret''. Semantically composite idioms have a syntactic similarity between their surface and semantic forms.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe types of movement allowed for certain idiom also relate to the degree to which the literal reading of the idiom has a connection to its idiomatic meaning. This is referred to as ''motivation'' or ''transparency''. While most idioms that do not display semantic composition generally do not allow non-adjectival modification, those that are also motivated allow lexical substitution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keizer|first=Evelien|year=2016|title=Idiomatic expressions in Functional Discourse Grammar|url=|journal=Linguistics|volume=54|pages=981\u20131016|via=}}</ref> For example, ''oil the wheels'' and ''grease the wheels'' allow variation for nouns that elicit a similar literal meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mostafa|first=Massrura|year=2010|title=Variation in V+the+N idioms|url=|journal=English Today|volume=26|pages=37\u201343|via=}}</ref> These types of changes can occur only when speakers can easily recognize a connection between what the idiom is meant to express and its literal meaning, thus an idiom like ''kick the bucket'' cannot occur as ''kick the pot''.\n\nFrom the perspective of [[dependency grammar]], idioms are represented as a [[catena (linguistics)|catena]] which cannot be interrupted by non-idiomatic content. Although syntactic modifications introduce disruptions to the idiomatic structure, this continuity is only required for idioms as lexical entries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O'Grady|first=William|year=1998|title=The Syntax of Idioms|url=|journal=Natural Language and Linguistic Theory|volume=16|pages=279\u2013312|via=}}</ref>\n\nCertain idioms, allowing unrestricted syntactic modification, can be said to be metaphors. Expressions such as ''jump on the bandwagon'', ''pull strings'', and ''draw the line'' all represent their meaning independently in their verbs and objects, making them compositional. In the idiom ''jump on the bandwagon'', ''jump on'' involves joining something and a 'bandwagon' can refer to a collective cause, regardless of context.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Translating idioms==\nA [[literal translation|literal word-by-word translation]] of an opaque idiom will most likely not convey the same meaning in other languages. The English idiom ''kick the bucket'' has a variety of equivalents in other languages, such as ''kopn\u0105\u0107 w kalendarz'' (\"kick the calendar\") in Polish, ''casser sa pipe'' (\"to break his pipe\") in French<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.idiommaster.com/search/en-fr?search-term=kick+the+bucket |title=Translation of the idiom kick the bucket in French |publisher=www.idiommaster.com |date= |accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref> and ''tirare le cuoia'' (\"pulling the leathers\") in Italian.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.idiommaster.com/search/en-it?search-term=kick+the+bucket |title=Translation of the idiom kick the bucket in Italian |publisher=www.idiommaster.com |date= |accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref>\n\nSome idioms are transparent.<ref>Gibbs, R. W. (1987)</ref> Much of their meaning does get through if they are taken (or translated) literally. For example, ''lay one's cards on the table'' meaning to reveal previously unknown intentions, or to reveal a secret. Transparency is a matter of degree; ''spill the beans'' (to let secret information become known) and ''leave no stone unturned'' (to do everything possible in order to achieve or find something) are not entirely literally interpretable, but only involve a slight metaphorical broadening. Another category of idioms is a word having several meanings, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes discerned from the context of its usage. This is seen in the (mostly uninflected) [[English language]] in [[polysemes]], the common use of the same word for an activity, for those engaged in it, for the product used, for the place or time of an activity, and sometimes for a [[verb]].\n\nIdioms tend to confuse those unfamiliar with them; students of a new language must learn its idiomatic expressions as vocabulary. Many [[natural language]] words have ''idiomatic origins'', but are assimilated, so losing their figurative senses, for example, in Portuguese, the expression ''saber de cora\u00e7\u00e3o'' 'to know by heart', with the same meaning as in English, was shortened to 'saber de cor', and, later, to the verb ''decorar'', meaning ''memorize''.\n\nIn 2015, [[TED (conference)|TED]] collected 40 examples of bizarre idioms that cannot be translated literally. They include the Swedish saying \"to slide in on a shrimp sandwich\", which refers to somebody who didn't have to work to get where they are.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/40-idioms-that-cant-be-translated-literally/|title=40 brilliant idioms that simply can\u2019t be translated literally|website=TED Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-08}}</ref>\n\nConversely, idioms may be shared between multiple languages. For example, the Arabic phrase \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0643\u0628 (fi nafs al-markab) is translated as \"in the same boat,\" and it carries the same figurative meaning as the equivalent idiom in English.\n\nAccording to German linguist Elizabeth Piirainen, the idiom \"to get on one's nerves\" has the same figurative meaning in 57 European languages. She also says that the phrase \"to shed crocodile tears,\"\u2014meaning to express insincere sorrow\u2014is similarly widespread in European languages, but is also used in Arabic, Swahili, Persian, Chinese, Mongolian, and several others.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe origin of cross-language idioms is uncertain. One theory is that cross-language idioms are a [[language contact]] phenomenon, resulting from a word-for-word translation called a [[calque]]. Piirainen says that this may happen as a result of [[lingua franca]] usage; speakers incorporate expressions from their own native tongue, exposing them to speakers of other languages. Other theories suggest they come from a shared ancestor language or that humans are naturally predisposed to develop certain metaphors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Dealing with non-compositionality==\nThe non-compositionality of meaning of idioms challenges theories of syntax. The fixed words of many idioms do not qualify as [[constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] in any sense. For example:\n\n{{quote|How do we '''get to the bottom of''' this situation?}}\n\nThe fixed words of this idiom (in bold) do not form a constituent in any theory's analysis of syntactic structure because the object of the preposition (here ''this situation'') is not part of the idiom (but rather it is an [[argument (linguistics)|argument]] of the idiom). One can know that it is not part of the idiom because it is variable; for example, ''How do we get to the bottom of this situation / the claim / the phenomenon / her statement /'' etc. What this means is that theories of syntax that take the constituent to be the fundamental unit of syntactic analysis are challenged. The manner in which units of meaning are assigned to units of syntax remains unclear. This problem has motivated a tremendous amount of discussion and debate in linguistics circles and it is a primary motivator behind the [[Construction Grammar]] framework.<ref>Culicver and Jackendoff (2005:32ff.)</ref>\n\nA relatively recent development in the syntactic analysis of idioms departs from a constituent-based account of syntactic structure, preferring instead the [[catena (linguistics)|catena]]-based account. The catena unit was introduced to linguistics by William O'Grady in 1998. Any word or any combination of words that are linked together by dependencies qualifies as a catena.<ref>Osborne and Gro\u00df (2012:173ff.)</ref> The words constituting idioms are stored as catenae in the lexicon, and as such, they are concrete units of syntax. The [[dependency grammar]] trees of a few sentences containing non-constituent idioms illustrate the point:\n\n::[[File:Idiom trees 1'.png|Idiom trees 1']]\n\nThe fixed words of the idiom (in orange) in each case are linked together by dependencies; they form a catena. The material that is outside of the idiom (in normal black script) is not part of the idiom. The following two trees illustrate proverbs:\n\n::[[File:Idiom trees 2.png|Idiom trees 2]]\n\nThe fixed words of the proverbs (in orange) again form a catena each time. The adjective ''nitty-gritty'' and the adverb ''always'' are not part of the respective proverb and their appearance does not interrupt the fixed words of the proverb. A caveat concerning the catena-based analysis of idioms concerns their status in the lexicon. Idioms are lexical items, which means they are stored as catenae in the lexicon. In the actual syntax, however, some idioms can be broken up by various functional constructions.\n\nThe catena-based analysis of idioms provides a basis for an understanding of meaning compositionality. The [[Principle of Compositionality]] can in fact be maintained. Units of meaning are being assigned to catenae, whereby many of these catenae are not constituents.\n\nVarious studies have investigated methods to develop the ability to interpret idioms in children with various diagnoses including Autism,<ref>Mashal and Kasirer, 2011</ref> Moderate Learning Difficulties,<ref>Ezell and Goldstein, 1992</ref> Developmental Language Disorder <ref>Benjamin, Ebbels and Newton, 2020</ref> and typically developing weak readers.<ref>Lundblom and Woods, 2012</ref>\n\n==Multiword expression==\nA multiword expression is \"lexical units larger than a word that can bear both idiomatic and compositional meanings. (...) the term multi-word expression is used as a pre-theoretical label to include the range of phenomena that goes from collocations to fixed expressions.\" It is a problem in [[natural language processing]] when trying to translate lexical units such as idioms.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Muller |first1=Peter |last2=Ohneiser |first2=Ingeborg |last3=Olsen |first3=Susan |last4=Rainer |first4=Franz |title=Word Formation, An International Handbook of the Languages of Europe (HSK Series) |date=Oct 2011 |publisher=Berlin: De Gruyter |page=Chapter 25: Multword Expressions |url=http://neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de/static/mh/Huening_Schluecker_2015_ms.pdf |accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/3-540-45715-1_1 |url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1810 |accessdate=8 August 2018|chapter=Multiword Expressions: A Pain in the Neck for NLP |title=Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing |volume=2276 |pages=1\u201315 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=2002 |last1=Sag |first1=Ivan A |last2=Baldwin |first2=Timothy |last3=Bond |first3=Francis |last4=Copestake |first4=Ann |last5=Flickinger |first5=Dan |isbn=978-3-540-43219-7 }}</ref><ref name=\"sailermarkantonatou\">{{Cite book\n| veditors = Sailer M, Markantonatou S\n| title = Multiword expressions: Insights from a multi-lingual perspective\n| place = Berlin\n| publisher = Language Science Press\n| date = 2018\n| format = pdf\n| url = http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/184\n| doi = 10.5281/zenodo.1182583\n| doi-access=free\n| isbn = 978-3-96110-063-7\n}}</ref><ref name=\"parmentier\">{{Cite book\n| veditors = Parmentier Y, Waszczuk J\n| title = Representation and parsing of multiword expressions: Current trends\n| place = Berlin\n| publisher = Language Science Press\n| date = 2019\n| format = pdf\n| url = http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/202\n| doi = 10.5281/zenodo.2579017\n| doi-access=free\n| isbn = 978-3-96110-145-0\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|small=no|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Adage]]\n* [[Catena (linguistics)]]\n* [[Chengyu]]\n* [[Clich\u00e9]]\n* [[Collocation]]\n* [[Comprehension of Idioms]]\n* [[Figure of speech]]\n* [[Idiom in English language]]\n* [[List of idioms in the English language]]\n* [[Principle of compositionality]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Benjamin, L., Ebbels, S. and Newton, C., 2020, \"Investigating the effectiveness of idiom intervention for 9-16 year olds with developmental language disorder.\" ''International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders''.  https://doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.12519\n* Crystal, ''A dictionary of linguistics and phonetics'', 4th edition.

The incumbent governor of the province is [[Saud bin Nayef Al Saud|Prince Saud bin Nayef Al Saud]]. Other populous cities in the province include [[Hofuf]], Mubarraz, [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]], [[Jubail]] and [[Khobar]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/saudi-arabia-population/cities/|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. The region is extremely popular among tourists for its beaches on the [[Persian Gulf]] and proximity to the other countries of the eastern [[Arab world]], such as the [[UAE|United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]], with the latter being linked to the province via the 25 km (15 mi) long [[King Fahd Causeway]]. The region also shares a border with [[Oman]]. The province is bordered to the west, from north to south, by the provinces of the [[Northern Borders Region|Northern Borders]], [[Ha'il Region|Ha'il]], [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]], [[Riyadh Region|Riyadh]] and [[Najran Region|Najran]].\n\nThe Eastern Province encompasses the entire east coast of Saudi Arabia and acts as a major platform for most of the kingdom's oil production and exports. [[Petroleum|Oil]] was first found in the country in the Eastern Province, at the Prosperity Well site (formerly known as Dammam No.7). The [[Ghawar Field|Ghawar oil field]], located in the [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]], measuring 8400 sq.km. (3240 sq.mi.) is the largest oil field in the world, and accounts for roughly a third of the kingdom's oil production. The [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], located off the coast of the province, is the largest [[offshore oil field]] in the world. The Jubail Industrial City, part of the city of [[Jubail]], the fifth most populous in the province, is the largest industrial city in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/world-s-largest-industrial-areas.html|title=The World's Largest Industrial Areas|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe area was largely uninhabited until the [[Iron Age]], when a few people migrated over from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] empires. For most of the early medieval period, the region was under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule until the advent of Islam under [[Muhammad]], and subsequently, the [[Islamic empires]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. After a brief period of [[British Empire|British]] rule during the early modern period, the [[Unification of Saudi Arabia]] led to the consolidation of the region into the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], which in 1932, was united into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Geography==\nApproximately two-thirds of the province is desert, comprising of, from south to north, the [[Rub' al Khali]], [[Ad-Dahna Desert|Dahna]] and [[An Nafud|Nafud]] deserts, with the Rub' al-Khali alone comprising more than half of the area of the province. Areas such as [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]] and the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]] have become important sites for [[desert farming]] due to the advancements made during the [[Green Revolution]] in farming and irrigation techniques. \n\nThe entire eastern coast of the kingdom lies in the Eastern Province. The region borders, from north to south, the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain|Bahrain,]] [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Oman]].\n\n==History==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n=== Lakhmid and Sasanian rule (300-623 AD) ===\nThe northern part of the Eastern Province was first inhabited by the [[Lakhmids]] around 300 AD, with the coastal regions claimed by the [[Sasanians]] but governed by the Lakhmids. Much of the Eastern Province was under [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule at the time of [[Muhammad|Muhammad.]] The entire [[Arabian Peninsula]] fell into Muslim hands during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], after [[Muhammad]]'s death. \n\n=== Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates (623-661, 661-750 & 750-899 AD) ===\nThe region stayed stable during the first three Islamic caliphates.\n\n=== Qarmatian rule (899-1076 AD) ===\nDuring the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the region was taken over by the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] group of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] branch, around 899 AD. The Qarmatians attacked [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]] and held the [[Black Stone]] to ransom in Ahsa in 920 AD. The region was ruled by the Qaramatians until 976 AD, when after losing to the Abbasids, they were reduced to the status of a local power. After Bahrain and Qatif seceded from Qarmatian rule around 1058 AD, they retreated to the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], to which [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] laid siege and invaded in 1076 AD, ending the rule of Qarmatians in Ahsa and founding the [[Uyunid Emirate]]. \n\n=== Uyunids, Usfurids and Jabrids (1076-1253, 1253-1320 & 1520-1521 AD) ===\nNot much is known of the Uyunids, except that they were the descendants of the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] tribe. They were involved in several internal disputes, causing the emirate to become unstable and eventually leading to the rise of the Bedouin Usfurids.\n\nThe Usfurids saw a short period of stability. After overthrowing their former allies, the Uyunids, they had an uneasy relationship with the Persian rulers of Hormuz, who took control of the former Uyunid cities of Qatif and Bahrain around 1320 AD. This eventually led to the fall of the Usfurids. \n\nThe region was mostly overlooked until 1520 AD, when the [[Jabrids]] built a more stable [[polity]], only for it to fall just a year later, in 1521.\n\n=== Ottoman invasions (1551-1671 AD) ===\nIn 1551 AD, the Ottomans invaded the region during their [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)|first war with the Safavids]], and kept it under their control until 1671.\n\nThe region has stayed in Muslims hands since. In the late 1800s, during the period of the [[Second Saudi State]], the area came into Saudi control for the first time from Ottoman hands, before briefly being taken over by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and then retaken by the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]] after the in 1913, which was later consolidated into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] under [[Ibn Saud]] on September 23, 1932.\n\nDue to the significance of the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], the region around the oasis, which comprises much of modern-day [[Hofuf]] and its surrounding areas, was simply known as ''al-Ahsa''' and the region around present-day [[Bahrain]] and the [[Greater Dammam]] area was simply known as ''al-Bahran'' from pre-Islamic times.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}{{historical populations|11=1992|12=2,575,820|13=2004|14=3,360,031|15=2010|16=4,130,033|17=2018|18=5,028,753|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/en/saudiarabia/cities/ Saudi Arabia: Regions and Cities]</ref>|align=right}}According to the Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the General Authority of Statistics, the Eastern Province had a population of 4,900,325 as of December 2017<ref name=\":0\" />, of which 3,140,362 were Saudis and 1,759,963 were foreign nationals.

The kingdom's main oil and gas fields are mostly located in the Eastern Province, onshore and offshore. Notable among these are the [[Ghawar Field]] and the largest [[crude increment]] in the world. Petroleum from the fields is shipped to dozens of countries from the oil port of [[Ras Tanura]] and is also used as feedstock in numerous industrial plants in [[Jubail]].\n\nSaudi Arabia's second major product, dates, also forms a large part of Eastern Province's economy. Every year thousands of tonnes of dates are harvested from the date palms in the giant oases of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Ahsa]].\n\nThe same as other cities in the Kingdom the area has faced reasonable growth over the past two years; however, it has always maintained a more consistent real estate progress due to the smaller number of major projects that can affect its real estate landscape and due the long term outlook of many firms located within it. A D Williams indicated in the Saudi Real Estate Companion that despite being home to some of the largest conglomerates in the region, namely [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco]] and [[SABIC|Sabic]], the Eastern Province did fall behind the rest of the country when it came to non-oil related services.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Air===\nDammam's [[King Fahd International Airport]], the largest airport in the world in terms of land area. The passenger terminal is about 20&nbsp;km to the northwest of the city and is connected by a 6-lane highway. The airport is the primary air hub of the Eastern Province. Dammam is well connected by air with other cities in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe.\n\nOther international airports in the province are [[Al-Ahsa International Airport]] and [[Al Qaisumah/Hafr Al Batin Airport]].\n\n===Sea===\nThe [[King Abdul Aziz Port|King Abdul Aziz Sea Port]], located on the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], is the second largest and second busiest port in [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is also the largest port in the Persian Gulf. It was founded in the late 1940s. It has large equipment that allows it to receive various types of vessels. The most important equipments are 56 multi-purpose hoist, 8 container cranes, and 524 tanker containers. There are a number of berths for ships and fishing, as well as ship repair yard.\n\n===Road===\nThe major cities of the Eastern Province cities such as [[Abqaiq]], [[Dammam]], [[Dhahran]], [[Hofuf]], [[Jubail]], [[Khafji]], [[Khobar]], [[Ras Tanura]], Sihat and [[Qatif]] ([[Gulf Road|Gulf Road (Saudi Arabia)]]) are well connected by highways. Dammam is connected to the Saudi capital, [[Riyadh]] and [[Jeddah]] on the west coast by [[Highway 40 (Saudi Arabia)|Highway 40]]. The Eastern Province is also linked to [[Bahrain]] by the 28&nbsp;km long [[King Fahd Causeway]], and to other Middle-Eastern countries such as [[Kuwait]] ([[Abu Hadriyah Highway]]), [[Oman]], [[Qatar]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].\n\nInter-city bus services are operated in the province by the [[Saudi Arabian Public Transport Company]] (SAPTCO). Bus services also connect Dammam and other cities in Saudi Arabia, and across the Middle East.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{see also|Regions of Saudi Arabia|List of governorates of Saudi Arabia}}\nThe Eastern Province is one of the 13 [[regions of Saudi Arabia]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arab.net/saudi/sa_admindivisions.htm |title=Saudi Arabia: Administrative divisions |publisher=arab.net }}</ref> ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642 \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629}}; ''manatiq id\u0101riyya'', sing. \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629; ''[[mintaqah]] idariyya'').

The region is extremely popular among tourists for its beaches on the [[Persian Gulf]] and proximity to the other countries of the eastern [[Arab world]], such as the [[UAE|United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]], with the latter being linked to the province via the 25 km (15 mi) long [[King Fahd Causeway]]. The region also shares a border with [[Oman]]. The province is bordered to the west, from north to south, by the provinces of the [[Northern Borders Region|Northern Borders]], [[Ha'il Region|Ha'il]], [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]], [[Riyadh Region|Riyadh]] and [[Najran Region|Najran]].\n\nThe Eastern Province encompasses the entire east coast of Saudi Arabia and acts as a major platform for most of the kingdom's oil production and exports. [[Petroleum|Oil]] was first found in the country in the Eastern Province, at the Prosperity Well site (formerly known as Dammam No.7). The [[Ghawar Field|Ghawar oil field]], located in the [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]], measuring 8400 sq.km. (3240 sq.mi.) is the largest oil field in the world, and accounts for roughly a third of the kingdom's oil production. The [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], located off the coast of the province, is the largest [[offshore oil field]] in the world. The Jubail Industrial City, part of the city of [[Jubail]], the fifth most populous in the province, is the largest industrial city in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/world-s-largest-industrial-areas.html|title=The World's Largest Industrial Areas|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe area was largely uninhabited until the [[Iron Age]], when a few people migrated over from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] empires. For most of the early medieval period, the region was under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule until the advent of Islam under [[Muhammad]], and subsequently, the [[Islamic empires]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. After a brief period of [[British Empire|British]] rule during the early modern period, the [[Unification of Saudi Arabia]] led to the consolidation of the region into the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], which in 1932, was united into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Geography==\nApproximately two-thirds of the province is desert, comprising of, from south to north, the [[Rub' al Khali]], [[Ad-Dahna Desert|Dahna]] and [[An Nafud|Nafud]] deserts, with the Rub' al-Khali alone comprising more than half of the area of the province. Areas such as [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]] and the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]] have become important sites for [[desert farming]] due to the advancements made during the [[Green Revolution]] in farming and irrigation techniques. \n\nThe entire eastern coast of the kingdom lies in the Eastern Province. The region borders, from north to south, the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain|Bahrain,]] [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Oman]].\n\n==History==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n=== Lakhmid and Sasanian rule (300-623 AD) ===\nThe northern part of the Eastern Province was first inhabited by the [[Lakhmids]] around 300 AD, with the coastal regions claimed by the [[Sasanians]] but governed by the Lakhmids. Much of the Eastern Province was under [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule at the time of [[Muhammad|Muhammad.]] The entire [[Arabian Peninsula]] fell into Muslim hands during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], after [[Muhammad]]'s death. \n\n=== Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates (623-661, 661-750 & 750-899 AD) ===\nThe region stayed stable during the first three Islamic caliphates.\n\n=== Qarmatian rule (899-1076 AD) ===\nDuring the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the region was taken over by the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] group of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] branch, around 899 AD. The Qarmatians attacked [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]] and held the [[Black Stone]] to ransom in Ahsa in 920 AD. The region was ruled by the Qaramatians until 976 AD, when after losing to the Abbasids, they were reduced to the status of a local power. After Bahrain and Qatif seceded from Qarmatian rule around 1058 AD, they retreated to the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], to which [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] laid siege and invaded in 1076 AD, ending the rule of Qarmatians in Ahsa and founding the [[Uyunid Emirate]]. \n\n=== Uyunids, Usfurids and Jabrids (1076-1253, 1253-1320 & 1520-1521 AD) ===\nNot much is known of the Uyunids, except that they were the descendants of the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] tribe. They were involved in several internal disputes, causing the emirate to become unstable and eventually leading to the rise of the Bedouin Usfurids.\n\nThe Usfurids saw a short period of stability. After overthrowing their former allies, the Uyunids, they had an uneasy relationship with the Persian rulers of Hormuz, who took control of the former Uyunid cities of Qatif and Bahrain around 1320 AD. This eventually led to the fall of the Usfurids. \n\nThe region was mostly overlooked until 1520 AD, when the [[Jabrids]] built a more stable [[polity]], only for it to fall just a year later, in 1521.\n\n=== Ottoman invasions (1551-1671 AD) ===\nIn 1551 AD, the Ottomans invaded the region during their [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)|first war with the Safavids]], and kept it under their control until 1671.\n\nThe region has stayed in Muslims hands since. In the late 1800s, during the period of the [[Second Saudi State]], the area came into Saudi control for the first time from Ottoman hands, before briefly being taken over by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and then retaken by the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]] after the in 1913, which was later consolidated into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] under [[Ibn Saud]] on September 23, 1932.\n\nDue to the significance of the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], the region around the oasis, which comprises much of modern-day [[Hofuf]] and its surrounding areas, was simply known as ''al-Ahsa''' and the region around present-day [[Bahrain]] and the [[Greater Dammam]] area was simply known as ''al-Bahran'' from pre-Islamic times.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}{{historical populations|11=1992|12=2,575,820|13=2004|14=3,360,031|15=2010|16=4,130,033|17=2018|18=5,028,753|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/en/saudiarabia/cities/ Saudi Arabia: Regions and Cities]</ref>|align=right}}According to the Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the General Authority of Statistics, the Eastern Province had a population of 4,900,325 as of December 2017<ref name=\":0\" />, of which 3,140,362 were Saudis and 1,759,963 were foreign nationals.

The kingdom's main oil and gas fields are mostly located in the Eastern Province, onshore and offshore. Notable among these are the [[Ghawar Field]] and the largest [[crude increment]] in the world. Petroleum from the fields is shipped to dozens of countries from the oil port of [[Ras Tanura]] and is also used as feedstock in numerous industrial plants in [[Jubail]].\n\nSaudi Arabia's second major product, dates, also forms a large part of Eastern Province's economy. Every year thousands of tonnes of dates are harvested from the date palms in the giant oases of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Ahsa]].\n\nThe same as other cities in the Kingdom the area has faced reasonable growth over the past two years; however, it has always maintained a more consistent real estate progress due to the smaller number of major projects that can affect its real estate landscape and due the long term outlook of many firms located within it. A D Williams indicated in the Saudi Real Estate Companion that despite being home to some of the largest conglomerates in the region, namely [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco]] and [[SABIC|Sabic]], the Eastern Province did fall behind the rest of the country when it came to non-oil related services.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Air===\nDammam's [[King Fahd International Airport]], the largest airport in the world in terms of land area. The passenger terminal is about 20&nbsp;km to the northwest of the city and is connected by a 6-lane highway. The airport is the primary air hub of the Eastern Province. Dammam is well connected by air with other cities in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe.\n\nOther international airports in the province are [[Al-Ahsa International Airport]] and [[Al Qaisumah/Hafr Al Batin Airport]].\n\n===Sea===\nThe [[King Abdul Aziz Port|King Abdul Aziz Sea Port]], located on the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], is the second largest and second busiest port in [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is also the largest port in the Persian Gulf. It was founded in the late 1940s. It has large equipment that allows it to receive various types of vessels. The most important equipments are 56 multi-purpose hoist, 8 container cranes, and 524 tanker containers. There are a number of berths for ships and fishing, as well as ship repair yard.\n\n===Road===\nThe major cities of the Eastern Province cities such as [[Abqaiq]], [[Dammam]], [[Dhahran]], [[Hofuf]], [[Jubail]], [[Khafji]], [[Khobar]], [[Ras Tanura]], Sihat and [[Qatif]] ([[Gulf Road|Gulf Road (Saudi Arabia)]]) are well connected by highways. Dammam is connected to the Saudi capital, [[Riyadh]] and [[Jeddah]] on the west coast by [[Highway 40 (Saudi Arabia)|Highway 40]]. The Eastern Province is also linked to [[Bahrain]] by the 28&nbsp;km long [[King Fahd Causeway]], and to other Middle-Eastern countries such as [[Kuwait]] ([[Abu Hadriyah Highway]]), [[Oman]], [[Qatar]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].\n\nInter-city bus services are operated in the province by the [[Saudi Arabian Public Transport Company]] (SAPTCO).

Chinmoy explains that by keeping your mind calm and quiet for ten or fifteen minutes, a new experience can begin to dawn within you and this practise of stilling the mind is the root of all spiritual progress.<ref>Chinmoy, Sri.

Aum Publications, 1978 (1989 reprint). pp. 3\u20135.</ref>\n\nChinmoy recommended meditation during the quiet atmosphere of the early morning, before starting daily activities. As the traditional Hour of God, between three and four a.m., known as the ''[[Brahma Muhurta]]'', may not suit the western lifestyle of keeping late hours, Chinmoy recommended for those newer to meditation to ideally meditate before seven a.m. Chinmoy taught that both prayer and meditation are important, but there is a difference in the result. Prayer is a process of rising up to God and speaking to Him, and meditation is a practice of stilling the mind so that the God-presence can envelop us and commune with us.<ref>Chinmoy, Sri.

Self-transcendence is the practice of having a new goal and going beyond our previous capacities and limits which inevitably gives us joy. Self-transcendence is the goal of making progress in life by becoming a better human being rather than competing with the rest of the world.

Chinmoy explains that by keeping your mind calm and quiet for ten or fifteen minutes, a new experience can begin to dawn within you and this practise of stilling the mind is the root of all spiritual progress.<ref>Chinmoy, Sri.

Aum Publications, 1978 (1989 reprint). pp. 3\u20135.</ref>\n\nChinmoy recommended meditation during the quiet atmosphere of the early morning, before starting daily activities. As the traditional Hour of God, between three and four a.m., known as the ''[[Brahma Muhurta]]'', may not suit the western lifestyle of keeping late hours, Chinmoy recommended for those newer to meditation to ideally meditate before seven a.m. Chinmoy taught that both prayer and meditation are important, but there is a difference in the result. Prayer is a process of rising up to God and speaking to Him, and meditation is a practice of stilling the mind so that the God-presence can envelop us and commune with us.<ref>Chinmoy, Sri.

overall World Cup totals.\n\nAll distance races, included individual stages in Tour de Ski and in World Cup Final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the distance standings. All sprint races, including the sprint races during the Tour de Ski and the first race of the World Cup final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the sprint standings.\n\nThe Nations Cup ranking is calculated by adding each country's individual competitors' scores and scores from team events. Relay events count double (see World Cup final positions), with only one team counting towards the total, while in team sprint events two teams contribute towards the total, with the usual World Cup points (100 to winning team, etc.) awarded.\n\n==Achievements==\n\n;First World Cup career victory:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Men\n*{{flagathlete|[[Ronny Hafs\u00e5s]]|NOR}}, 24, in his 2nd season

overall World Cup totals.\n\nAll distance races, included individual stages in Tour de Ski and in World Cup Final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the distance standings. All sprint races, including the sprint races during the Tour de Ski and the first race of the World Cup final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the sprint standings.\n\nThe Nations Cup ranking is calculated by adding each country's individual competitors' scores and scores from team events. Relay events count double (see World Cup final positions), with only one team counting towards the total, while in team sprint events two teams contribute towards the total, with the usual World Cup points (100 to winning team, etc.) awarded.\n\n==Achievements==\n\n;First World Cup career victory:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Men\n*{{flagathlete|[[Ronny Hafs\u00e5s]]|NOR}}, 24, in his 2nd season \u2013 the WC 1 (15 km F) in Beitost\u00f8len;

It covers the western half of the area traditionally known as the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]]. It contains [[Birmingham]] and the larger [[West Midlands conurbation]], which is the [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|third most populous]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The City of [[Coventry]] is also located within the [[West Midlands county]], but is separated from the [[conurbation]] to the west by several miles of [[green belt]]. The region also contains 6 shire counties which stretch from the Welsh Border to the East Midlands.\n\nThe region is geographically diverse, from the urban central areas of the conurbation to the rural western counties of [[Shropshire]] and [[Herefordshire]] which border [[Wales]]. The longest river in the UK, the [[River Severn]], traverses the region southeastwards, flowing through the [[county town]]s of [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Worcester]], and the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. [[Staffordshire]] is home to the industrialised [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]] conurbation, including the city of [[Stoke-on-Trent]], and the [[Staffordshire Moorlands]] area, which borders the southeastern [[Peak District National Park]] near [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]]. The region also encompasses five [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], the [[Wye Valley]], [[Shropshire Hills]], [[Cannock Chase]], [[Malvern Hills]], and parts of the [[Cotswolds]]. [[Warwickshire]] is home to the towns of [[Stratford upon Avon]], birthplace of writer [[William Shakespeare]], [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], the birthplace of [[Rugby football]] and [[Nuneaton]], birthplace to author [[George Eliot]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe official region contains the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of [[Herefordshire]], Shropshire, [[Staffordshire]], Warwickshire, [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] and [[Worcestershire]].\n[[File:Lyth Hill 01.jpg|thumb|Rural [[Shropshire]], [[Bayston Hill|Lyth Hill]].]]\n\nThere is some confusion in the use of the term \"West Midlands\", as the name is also used for the much smaller [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands county]] and conurbation which is in the central belt of the Midlands and on the eastern side of the West Midlands Region. It is also still used by various organisations within that area, such as [[West Midlands Police]] and [[West Midlands Fire Service]].\n\nThe highest point in the region is [[Black Mountain (hill)|Black Mountain]], at 703&nbsp;metres (2,307&nbsp;ft) in west Herefordshire on the border with [[Powys]], Wales.\n\nThe region contains five [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONBs), including the [[Shropshire Hills]], [[Malvern Hills]] and [[Cannock Chase]], and parts of the [[Wye Valley]] and [[Cotswolds]]. The [[Peak District]] national park also stretches into the northern corner of [[Staffordshire]].\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway_Map.JPG|thumb|Map of the West Midlands passenger railway network]]\nServed by many lines in the urban areas such as the [[West Coast Main Line]] and branches.  The [[Welsh Marches Line]] and the [[Cotswold Line]] transect the region as well as the [[Cross Country Route]] and [[Chiltern Line]].  There are plans to reopen the [[Honeybourne Line]].\n\n===Road===\n[[File:M6 Toll plaza, Great Wyrley.jpg|thumb|The [[M6 Toll]] plaza.]]\nNumerous notable roads pass through the region, with most converging around the central conurbation. The [[M5 motorway|M5]], which connects [[South West England]] to the region, passes through Worcestershire, near to [[Worcester]], and through the [[West Midlands county]], past [[West Bromwich]], with its northern terminus at its junction with the [[M6 motorway|M6]] just south of [[Walsall]]. The M6, which has its southern terminus just outside the southeast of the region at its junction with the [[M1 motorway|M1]], and which connects the region to [[North West England]], passes [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] and [[Nuneaton]] in Warwickshire, [[Coventry]] and [[Birmingham]], and [[Stafford]] and [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in Staffordshire. The [[M6 toll]] provides an alternative route to the M6 between [[Coleshill, Warwickshire|Coleshill]] and [[Cannock]], passing north of [[Sutton Coldfield]] and just south of [[Lichfield]].  The [[M40 motorway|M40]] connects the region through [[South East England]] to London, with its northern terminus at its junction with the [[M42 motorway|M42]]; it passes close to [[Warwick]] and [[Banbury]]. The M42 connects the M5 at [[Bromsgrove]], passing around the south and east of Birmingham, joining the M40 and M6, passing [[Solihull]] and [[Castle Bromwich]], to [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], northeast of Birmingham.  The [[M50 motorway (Great Britain)|M50]] connects the M5 from near [[Tewkesbury]] to [[Ross-on-Wye]] in the southwest. The [[M54 motorway|M54]] connects [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] in the west, passing [[Telford]], to the M6 near [[Cannock]]. The [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5 road]] traverses the region northwest-southeast, passing through [[Shrewsbury]], [[Telford]], [[Cannock]], [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and [[Nuneaton]].\n\nThe longest elevated road viaduct in the UK is the {{convert|4779|m|mi|0|order=flip}} section from Gravelly Hill to Castle Bromwich on the M6, opened on 24 May 1972; the {{convert|5.6|km|mi|order=flip}} [[Bromford Viaduct]] is the longest viaduct in the UK. The section of the A45 in Coventry from [[Willenhall, Coventry|Willenhall]] to Allesley in 1939 was one of the UK's first ever large planned road schemes; road schemes on that scale had not been previously built, with few large road schemes outside of London, or were piecemeal.\n\nPrinces Square in Wolverhampton had Britain's first automatic traffic lights on 5 November 1927.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Princes_Square|title=Princes Square - Roader's Digest: The SABRE Wiki|author=|date=|website=www.sabre-roads.org.uk|access-date=15 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115221840/https://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Princes_Square|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> On 13 January 2012, 34-year-old Ben Westwood of Wednesfield, was caught by the police, when speeding at 180&nbsp;mph, in an [[Audi A5|Audi RS5]] with a [[Lamborghini]] engine, from Wolverhampton up to Stafford on the M6, and back again.

High Duty Alloys at Redditch constructed (forged) the compressor and turbine blades for Whittle's first engines, and many of the early jet engines; it made [[Concorde]]'s airframe from the [[Hiduminium]] R.R.58 [[aluminium alloy]].\n\n[[Maxaret]], the world's first [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] [[Brake|braking]] system, was invented in Coventry by Dunlop in the early 1950s for aircraft; [[John Boyd Dunlop]] was a Scottish vet who had first produced the first pneumatic [[Tire|tyres]] in 1889. [[Matthew Piers Watt Boulton]], grandson of Matthew Boulton, and born in the area, invented the [[aileron]], an important [[Flight control surfaces|flight control surface]] in 1868, decades before the first actual flight. [[Triumph Engineering]] was a famous motorbike firm in Meriden. About a quarter of all British WWI planes were built in Coventry. The [[Jensen Interceptor]] FF was the first production four-wheel-drive car in the world, designed by Major [[Tony Rolt]], and built at their factory in West Bromwich.\n\nCadbury launched ''[[Cadbury Dairy Milk|Dairy Milk]]'' in 1905, ''[[Bournville (chocolate bar)|Bournville]]'' in 1906, ''[[Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut|Fruit & Nut]]'' in 1928, ''Whole Nut'' in 1930, ''[[Cadbury Roses]]'' in 1938, and the ''[[Cadbury Creme Egg]]'' in 1971. [[George Cadbury|George]] and [[Richard Cadbury]] built their factory in 1879 and [[Bournville]] in 1893, named after the [[Bournbrook|Bourn brook]]. [[Iceland (supermarket)]] opened its first store in Oswestry in 1970 \u2013 heralding the onset of frozen food in the UK. [[Alfred Bird]] invented egg-free custard in 1837 in Birmingham \u2013 accidentally given to guests at his home, being created as his wife had an allergy to eggs; he then invented [[baking powder]] in 1843 as his wife also had an allergy to [[yeast]].\n\n===Culture===\n[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] grew up in Birmingham, Kings Heath, then part of Worcestershire, and was inspired by [[Moseley Bog]] and [[Sarehole]], and perhaps by the [[Perrott's Folly]]. [[Philip Larkin]] came from Coventry. [[Rowland Hill]] (stamps) was from Kidderminster. The writer [[George Eliot]] came from [[Nuneaton]]. [[Anthony E. Pratt]] from Birmingham invented [[Cluedo]].\n\n[[Frederick Gibberd]] of Coventry designed [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral]]. [[Edward Cave]] from Rugby made Britain's first magazine in 1731 \u2013 [[The Gentleman's Magazine]]. [[Philip Astley]] from Newcastle under Lyme invented the modern day circus in 1768 \u2013 [[Astley's Amphitheatre]].\n\nThe [[Castlemorton Common Festival]] in May 1992 near Malvern, led to the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].\n\nThe highest numbered building in the UK is 2679 Stratford Road, [[A3400 road|Stratford Road]], [[Hockley Heath]].\n\nThe [[Nowka Bais]] is a [[Bengali culture|Bengali]] [[boat racing]] festival which takes place annually in [[Birmingham]].

The board is not an elected body, but is made up of members appointed from local councils across the region and is known as a [[quango]]. It is based on ''Edward Street'' in Birmingham, near the [[National Indoor Arena]]. From March 2010, the funding decisions at regional level were taken over by [[Advantage West Midlands]], the [[Regional Development Agency]].\n\n==Demographics==\n\n===Ethnicity===\n[[File:United Kingdom European Union referendum 2016 voting area results (West Midlands).svg|thumb|450px|right|How the West Midlands region voted in the June 2016 [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|European Union referendum]]; only the (university) district of Warwick voted (58.8%) to stay in the EU; the region had the highest overall vote (59.3%) to leave, with large proportions in Stoke-on-Trent (69.4%) and [[Cannock Chase District|Cannock Chase]] (68.9%)]]\nThe West Midlands is the second most ethnically diverse region of the UK (London being the most diverse).

These areas, like all rural areas of the West Midlands, have Conservative MPs. At county level, the least deprived areas, in descending order, were Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Solihull, Staffordshire, and Shropshire.\n\nIn March 2011 the region had the second highest overall [[Jobseeker's Allowance|unemployment claimant]] count in England at 4.7%, second to [[North East England]]. The highest in the region was Wolverhampton at 7.7%, the joint second highest (with Manchester) unemployment rate in England. Next is Sandwell with 7.1%, Birmingham with 7.0%, and Walsall with 6.4%. The lowest rate in the region is the district of [[Stratford-on-Avon (district)|Stratford-on-Avon]], with 1.6% \u2013 one of the lowest unemployment rates in England.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/elmr/downloads/Table6-18.xls|title=Claimant count}}</ref>\n\n===Elections===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nThe [[Green Party of England and Wales]] was formed at the Bridge Inn in [[Napton-on-the-Hill]], Warwickshire, in February 1973,\nand originated from an article by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] about population growth in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine; it became the Ecology Party in 1975 and the Green Party in 1985; the first conference was in June 1973 at ''The Allesley Hotel'' at the [[A4114 road|A4114]]/A45 junction south of the main Jaguar works in [[Allesley]], in west Coventry.\n\n[[File:United Kingdom General Election 2017 Results Map (West Midlands).svg|thumb|right|General Election results in 2017]]\nIn the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], [[Nuneaton (UK Parliament constituency)|Nuneaton]] was taken by Labour with a 7% swing, which was one of the largest swings of the night; in the 2015 election, the Nuneaton result would largely seal the eventual outcome of the election. In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], [[North Warwickshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Warwickshire]] ([[Dan Byles]]) had the smallest Conservative majority, with 54; [[Stoke-on-Trent Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Stoke-on-Trent Central]] had the smallest number of winning votes, with 12,220.\n\nIn the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], the Conservatives gained the largest share of the region by popular vote and took control of the number of seats, with 42% of the region's electorate voting Conservative, 33% Labour, 16% UKIP, 6% Liberal Democrat and 3% Green. The Conservatives gained 2 seats with virtually no swing from Labour to Conservative.\n\nIn the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], [[South Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Staffordshire]] ([[Gavin Williamson]]) had the second-highest Conservative vote proportion in the UK \u2013 69.8%. [[David Firth (statistician)|David Firth]], at the [[University of Warwick]], invented the BBC election [[exit poll]]. 6&nbsp;ft 9 [[Daniel Kawczynski]], a Shropshire MP, is the tallest MP ever.\n\nAlthough having a slightly smaller percentage of the vote than the neighbouring [[East Midlands]], the geographic area of the West Midlands is more Conservative, due to Labour's vote now consigned to the urban areas of Birmingham, Coventry and Stoke-on-Trent. The number of seats is more favoured towards Labour than the geographic spread, with 35 Conservative seats and 24 Labour.

The highest proportion per head therefore is Warwickshire (its population is between 550,000 and 600,000 people). The other counties and metropolitan boroughs have none, their public education systems are comprehensive in intake. The grammar and independent schools tend to produce pass-rate examination results among the top twenty ranked regionally. Many pupils compete for entrance examinations to attend such long-established [[Grammar schools in England|Grammar Schools]] and most have significant parent sponsorship. In 2016 two of the top ten such schools nationally were in Warwickshire, where in the [[CV postcode area|CV37 postal district]] prices were 34% higher than the county as a whole.<ref>https://www.lloydsbank.com/assets/media/pdfs/press-releases/2016/160907-house-prices-near-schools-press-release.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212074021/http://www.lloydsbank.com/assets/media/pdfs/press-releases/2016/160907-house-prices-near-schools-press-release.pdf |date=12 December 2017 }} Press Release \"Parents willing to pay \u00a353,000 more to live near a top school\n\", Lloyds Bank, 2016</ref> The top 20 schools at A-level rarely change from year to year; slightly lower in the table pass-rate boosts and top grades regularly occur among the schools receiving industrial funding, with similar frequency to London, the North East, and the North West, particularly in [[free school (England)|schools]] and [[Academy (English school)|academies]] which have some of the most advanced facilities.\n\nAround 275,000 secondary schools are in the region, the greatest number after the [[South East England|South East]], Greater London and [[North West England|North West]].\n\nAt [[GCSE]] based on % of entrants' pass rates, the best performing local government area in 2010 was [[Solihull]], closely followed by Warwickshire and Shropshire.

The area consistently having fewest passes is [[Sandwell]], followed by Stoke-on-Trent.  Struggling pupils in Wolverhampton and Walsall also attain fewer passes than the English average in most GCSE years, sometimes by a very narrow margin.

It has a large research grant, as does the University of Warwick, which is the next largest in terms of funding. Birmingham and Warwick are members of the [[Russell Group]] of public research universities. Keele and Aston have a moderate research grant, but none of the other universities do. Keele, although having the largest campus in the UK (by area), is one of the smallest universities in the region. There are medical schools at [[Warwick Medical School|Warwick]], [[Keele University Medical School|Keele]] and [[University of Birmingham Medical School|Birmingham]]. Birmingham and Warwick receive more than twice as much total income than any other university in the region \u2013 around \u00a3400&nbsp;million each.\n\nAround 45% of students are from the region, and 35% from other parts of the UK, while 20% are from overseas.  The region attracts students from [[South East England]] owing to good access via the [[M40 motorway|M40]] and the [[West Coast Main Line]], but there is a good mix from other regions too, except the North East (especially) and Yorkshire.  Students native to the West Midlands are most likely to study in the region (40%), then the [[East Midlands]] (12%), the [[North West England|North West]] (11%), and then Yorkshire (9%). Very few go to the [[East of England]] or the [[North East England|North East]]. The region has a net export of university students to other regions.\n\nAt time of graduation in 2010 almost 60% of graduates remained in the West Midlands, with 10% going to London, 7% to the South-East, and around 5% to the East Midlands. Very few go to Yorkshire, the North-East, or even (neighbouring) Wales.\n\n==Media==\n{{See also|Media in Birmingham}}\n\n=== Television ===\n[[File:ITV Central TV studios - geograph.org.uk - 1150068.jpg|thumb|right|ITV Central [[Gas Street Studios]] in Birmingham]]\nThe West Midlands region of the [[BBC]] is based at the [[Mailbox Birmingham|Mailbox]] in Birmingham.

It covers the western half of the area traditionally known as the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]]. It contains [[Birmingham]] and the larger [[West Midlands conurbation]], which is the [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|third most populous]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The City of [[Coventry]] is also located within the [[West Midlands county]], but is separated from the [[conurbation]] to the west by several miles of [[green belt]]. The region also contains 6 shire counties which stretch from the Welsh Border to the East Midlands.\n\nThe region is geographically diverse, from the urban central areas of the conurbation to the rural western counties of [[Shropshire]] and [[Herefordshire]] which border [[Wales]]. The longest river in the UK, the [[River Severn]], traverses the region southeastwards, flowing through the [[county town]]s of [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Worcester]], and the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. [[Staffordshire]] is home to the industrialised [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]] conurbation, including the city of [[Stoke-on-Trent]], and the [[Staffordshire Moorlands]] area, which borders the southeastern [[Peak District National Park]] near [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]]. The region also encompasses five [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], the [[Wye Valley]], [[Shropshire Hills]], [[Cannock Chase]], [[Malvern Hills]], and parts of the [[Cotswolds]]. [[Warwickshire]] is home to the towns of [[Stratford upon Avon]], birthplace of writer [[William Shakespeare]], [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], the birthplace of [[Rugby football]] and [[Nuneaton]], birthplace to author [[George Eliot]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe official region contains the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of [[Herefordshire]], Shropshire, [[Staffordshire]], Warwickshire, [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] and [[Worcestershire]].\n[[File:Lyth Hill 01.jpg|thumb|Rural [[Shropshire]], [[Bayston Hill|Lyth Hill]].]]\n\nThere is some confusion in the use of the term \"West Midlands\", as the name is also used for the much smaller [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands county]] and conurbation which is in the central belt of the Midlands and on the eastern side of the West Midlands Region. It is also still used by various organisations within that area, such as [[West Midlands Police]] and [[West Midlands Fire Service]].\n\nThe highest point in the region is [[Black Mountain (hill)|Black Mountain]], at 703&nbsp;metres (2,307&nbsp;ft) in west Herefordshire on the border with [[Powys]], Wales.\n\nThe region contains five [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONBs), including the [[Shropshire Hills]], [[Malvern Hills]] and [[Cannock Chase]], and parts of the [[Wye Valley]] and [[Cotswolds]]. The [[Peak District]] national park also stretches into the northern corner of [[Staffordshire]].\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway_Map.JPG|thumb|Map of the West Midlands passenger railway network]]\nServed by many lines in the urban areas such as the [[West Coast Main Line]] and branches.  The [[Welsh Marches Line]] and the [[Cotswold Line]] transect the region as well as the [[Cross Country Route]] and [[Chiltern Line]].  There are plans to reopen the [[Honeybourne Line]].\n\n===Road===\n[[File:M6 Toll plaza, Great Wyrley.jpg|thumb|The [[M6 Toll]] plaza.]]\nNumerous notable roads pass through the region, with most converging around the central conurbation. The [[M5 motorway|M5]], which connects [[South West England]] to the region, passes through Worcestershire, near to [[Worcester]], and through the [[West Midlands county]], past [[West Bromwich]], with its northern terminus at its junction with the [[M6 motorway|M6]] just south of [[Walsall]]. The M6, which has its southern terminus just outside the southeast of the region at its junction with the [[M1 motorway|M1]], and which connects the region to [[North West England]], passes [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] and [[Nuneaton]] in Warwickshire, [[Coventry]] and [[Birmingham]], and [[Stafford]] and [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in Staffordshire. The [[M6 toll]] provides an alternative route to the M6 between [[Coleshill, Warwickshire|Coleshill]] and [[Cannock]], passing north of [[Sutton Coldfield]] and just south of [[Lichfield]].  The [[M40 motorway|M40]] connects the region through [[South East England]] to London, with its northern terminus at its junction with the [[M42 motorway|M42]]; it passes close to [[Warwick]] and [[Banbury]]. The M42 connects the M5 at [[Bromsgrove]], passing around the south and east of Birmingham, joining the M40 and M6, passing [[Solihull]] and [[Castle Bromwich]], to [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], northeast of Birmingham.  The [[M50 motorway (Great Britain)|M50]] connects the M5 from near [[Tewkesbury]] to [[Ross-on-Wye]] in the southwest. The [[M54 motorway|M54]] connects [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] in the west, passing [[Telford]], to the M6 near [[Cannock]]. The [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5 road]] traverses the region northwest-southeast, passing through [[Shrewsbury]], [[Telford]], [[Cannock]], [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and [[Nuneaton]].\n\nThe longest elevated road viaduct in the UK is the {{convert|4779|m|mi|0|order=flip}} section from Gravelly Hill to Castle Bromwich on the M6, opened on 24 May 1972; the {{convert|5.6|km|mi|order=flip}} [[Bromford Viaduct]] is the longest viaduct in the UK. The section of the A45 in Coventry from [[Willenhall, Coventry|Willenhall]] to Allesley in 1939 was one of the UK's first ever large planned road schemes; road schemes on that scale had not been previously built, with few large road schemes outside of London, or were piecemeal.\n\nPrinces Square in Wolverhampton had Britain's first automatic traffic lights on 5 November 1927.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Princes_Square|title=Princes Square - Roader's Digest: The SABRE Wiki|author=|date=|website=www.sabre-roads.org.uk|access-date=15 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115221840/https://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Princes_Square|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> On 13 January 2012, 34-year-old Ben Westwood of Wednesfield, was caught by the police, when speeding at 180&nbsp;mph, in an [[Audi A5|Audi RS5]] with a [[Lamborghini]] engine, from Wolverhampton up to Stafford on the M6, and back again.

[[Matthew Piers Watt Boulton]], grandson of Matthew Boulton, and born in the area, invented the [[aileron]], an important [[Flight control surfaces|flight control surface]] in 1868, decades before the first actual flight. [[Triumph Engineering]] was a famous motorbike firm in Meriden. About a quarter of all British WWI planes were built in Coventry. The [[Jensen Interceptor]] FF was the first production four-wheel-drive car in the world, designed by Major [[Tony Rolt]], and built at their factory in West Bromwich.\n\nCadbury launched ''[[Cadbury Dairy Milk|Dairy Milk]]'' in 1905, ''[[Bournville (chocolate bar)|Bournville]]'' in 1906, ''[[Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut|Fruit & Nut]]'' in 1928, ''Whole Nut'' in 1930, ''[[Cadbury Roses]]'' in 1938, and the ''[[Cadbury Creme Egg]]'' in 1971.

It has a large research grant, as does the University of Warwick, which is the next largest in terms of funding. Birmingham and Warwick are members of the [[Russell Group]] of public research universities. Keele and Aston have a moderate research grant, but none of the other universities do. Keele, although having the largest campus in the UK (by area), is one of the smallest universities in the region. There are medical schools at [[Warwick Medical School|Warwick]], [[Keele University Medical School|Keele]] and [[University of Birmingham Medical School|Birmingham]]. Birmingham and Warwick receive more than twice as much total income than any other university in the region \u2013 around \u00a3400&nbsp;million each.\n\nAround 45% of students are from the region, and 35% from other parts of the UK, while 20% are from overseas.  The region attracts students from [[South East England]] owing to good access via the [[M40 motorway|M40]] and the [[West Coast Main Line]], but there is a good mix from other regions too, except the North East (especially) and Yorkshire.  Students native to the West Midlands are most likely to study in the region (40%), then the [[East Midlands]] (12%), the [[North West England|North West]] (11%), and then Yorkshire (9%). Very few go to the [[East of England]] or the [[North East England|North East]]. The region has a net export of university students to other regions.\n\nAt time of graduation in 2010 almost 60% of graduates remained in the West Midlands, with 10% going to London, 7% to the South-East, and around 5% to the East Midlands. Very few go to Yorkshire, the North-East, or even (neighbouring) Wales.\n\n==Media==\n{{See also|Media in Birmingham}}\n\n=== Television ===\n[[File:ITV Central TV studios - geograph.org.uk - 1150068.jpg|thumb|right|ITV Central [[Gas Street Studios]] in Birmingham]]\nThe West Midlands region of the [[BBC]] is based at the [[Mailbox Birmingham|Mailbox]] in Birmingham.
