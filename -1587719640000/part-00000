It is known in the United Kingdom by its original title or in translation as '''''Lunch on the Grass'''''. A satire on contemporary science and politics, it revolves around a prominent biologist and politician who wants to replace sex with [[artificial insemination]], but begins to reconsider when a picnic he organizes is interrupted by the forces of nature. The film brings up issues of [[modernity]], [[human reproduction]], youth and [[European integration]]. It ridicules [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] and celebrates a type of [[materialism]] it associates with [[classical mythology]] and [[ancient Greek philosophy]].\n\nThe title is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' by [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. The female lead in ''Picnic on the Grass'' was the first major role for Rouvel, who due to an unusual contract would not appear in another film until 1963. Filming took place around Renoir's childhood home in [[Provence]], and inspiration came from the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] paintings of his father, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. The filming technique was influenced by [[live television]] and involved [[Multiple-camera setup|multiple cameras]] and direct audio recording.\n\nThe press reviews were generally positive and described the film as charming and beautiful. Negative response came from the political left, where critics disapproved of the film's treatment of [[progress]] and depiction of a European [[superstate]]. The subject of European unification was topical and sensitive due to the creation of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957. The film was a commercial failure and has attracted little attention from general audiences over the years.\n\n==Plot==\nThe famous biologist \u00c9tienne Alexis is the frontrunner in the upcoming election of the first President of [[United States of Europe|Europe]]. He advocates mandatory [[artificial insemination]] in order to [[Eugenics|improve humanity]] and make it worthy of modern science. He is newly engaged to his German cousin Marie-Charlotte and has invited her to a picnic near his mansion in [[Provence]].\n\nN\u00e9nette, a farmer's daughter, is disappointed with men after a failed relationship. She still wants children and applies to be a test subject for \u00c9tienne's insemination project. She ends up hired as his chambermaid and accompanies the picnic with the other servants. Present at the picnic are several cousins from both France and Germany. They are all stiff, rationally minded and profess belief in scientific [[progress]]. They have invited journalists to document the event as a symbol for the new unified Europe. The picnic takes place next to the ruins of a temple of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the goddess who the ancient Romans believed presided over childbirth. Nearby is also a group of young campers. N\u00e9nette is worried when she spots the goatherd Gaspard. She knows that when Gaspard plays his flute, strange things tend to happen. Gaspard plays and suddenly a strong wind blows away the picnic chairs and tables. As everybody takes cover, \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette are separated from the rest.\n\nWhen the wind subsides, they are invited to sit down with the campers. \u00c9tienne explains to the youth how he hopes to eliminate passion. Meanwhile, a [[Bacchanalia]] breaks out among the picnic guests not far away. Leaving the campers to look for Marie-Charlotte, \u00c9tienne ends up seeing N\u00e9nette [[Nude swimming|swimming nude]]. Shortly thereafter, Gaspard plays his flute again, and \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette run off into the high reeds. After returning, the two see the cousins and servants leaving in cars. They choose to not approach them and instead rejoin the campers, who offer them to stay the night in their camp. The next morning, \u00c9tienne says he wants to escape from the world for a while, so he and N\u00e9nette go to stay at N\u00e9nette's father Nino's house. \u00c9tienne begins to reconsider the relationship between humans and the natural world. The cousins eventually locate him and come to Nino's house. They convince N\u00e9nette to leave. Realizing she is gone, \u00c9tienne becomes agitated and goes to look for her. Gaspard, the goatherd, recommends him to kneel before his goat and ask for help. After doing so, \u00c9tienne turns ecstatic and shouts \"Down with science!\" before his cousins capture him.\n\n\u00c9tienne goes back to his old life, but on the day of his wedding he discovers N\u00e9nette working in a hotel kitchen. She is happily pregnant with his child. He abruptly brings her, not Marie-Charlotte, to the waiting crowd. He will launch his presidential campaign with a speech about science and nature, and he intends to marry N\u00e9nette.\n\n==Cast==\nCast adapted from ''A Companion to Jean Renoir'' and the [[British Film Institute]].{{sfnm|1a1=Phillips|1a2=Vincendeau|1y=2013|1p=583|2a1=British Film Institute}}\n* [[Paul Meurisse]] as Professor \u00c9tienne Alexis\n* [[Catherine Rouvel]] as N\u00e9nette\n* [[Fernand Sardou]] as Nino, N\u00e9nette's father\n* Jacqueline Morane as Titine, N\u00e9nette's elder sister\n* [[Jean-Pierre Granval]] as Ritou, Titine's husband\n* Ingrid Nordine as Marie-Charlotte\n* [[Charles Blavette]] as Gaspard, the old goatherd\n* [[Paulette Dubost]] as Mlle Forestier, the telephonist\n\n==Themes==\n===Modernity and nature===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 020.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Oil painting of a nude woman who sits on a rock and leans on a bow. At her feet is a dead deer with its neck pierced by an arrow.|''[[Diana (Renoir painting)|Diana]]'' by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1867]]\nThe themes of ''Picnic on the Grass'' revolve around modern issues such as artificial insemination, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and the [[mass media]]. [[Jean Renoir]]'s biographer [[Pascal M\u00e9rigeau]] writes that the film \"deals with disturbingly serious subjects using a farcical tone\".{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The film historian [[Jean Douchet]] writes that the film should be taken seriously, but describes its story as an invitation to not do so.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=295}} Renoir satirizes a [[modernity]] he does not think highly of, and uses story and tone to tell the viewer that it is not very important.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=700\u2013701}}\n\nThe central conflict is built on several [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]: between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]], the [[Technocracy|technocratic]] [[Northern Europe]] and underdeveloped [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]], and the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] of [[Postchristianity]] and [[Materialism|materialist]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy of ancient Greece]].{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=298\u2013299}} The film ridicules the idealist notion of progress and celebrates the Dionysian world.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} It portrays an empty spirituality produced by a bureaucratic [[utilitarianism]], and thereby seeks to justify the celebration of a material world imbued with spirit.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=349}} When \u00c9tienne converses with a Christian priest, the two are shown to have disagreements, but to simultaneously understand each other well. This is because both still belong to the idealist side in the film's conflict.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} According to Douchet, the film sets up a scenario where harmonious equilibrium is achieved when science abandons idealism and submits to a materialist view of nature. This happens when \u00c9tienne marries N\u00e9nette who is pregnant with their naturally conceived child.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=299\u2013300}}\n\n\u00c9tienne is an intellectual who lives in a theoretical world. This makes him similar to the main characters in two earlier works by Renoir: the play ''Orvet'' (1955) and the television film ''[[The Doctor's Horrible Experiment]]'' (1959).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=314}} \u00c9tienne's eugenic ideology combines rationalism and [[moralism]] in a way that gives [[Darwinism]] an active role in concord with [[individualism]]. [[Human reproduction]] and [[Human evolution|evolution]] become tied to \u00c9tienne's own [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficiency]] and to ideas about social responsibility.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=349\u2013350}} N\u00e9nette is comfortable with her human physicality, but is also driven by self-sufficiency in her wish to have her own child through artificial insemination. She is [[Emancipation|emancipated]] and mobile, and it is her actions that twice bring her to \u00c9tienne. Another\u2014militaristic\u2014type of women's emancipation is represented by Marie-Charlotte.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}} Allied against Western rationalism are the gods [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and Diana. Pan is evoked through the flute-playing goatherd, and Diana presides over [[chastity]] and childbirth, which in this [[Classical mythology|classical mythological]] context are aspects of female independence.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}}\n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Renoir - PORTRAIT DE JEAN RENOIR, 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painted bust portrait of Jean Renoir as a young boy|Portrait of Jean Renoir by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1910]]\nRenoir had spent years of his childhood and adolescence in the area where ''Picnic on the Grass'' was filmed.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} He had recently begun to write a book about his father, the painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], which made him reminisce about his early life.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Accordng to M\u00e9rigeau, the film was a way for Renoir to confront the boy he once was with the troubling questions of the contemporary world. Renoir's reconnection to his young self is paralleled in the mode of storytelling which is reminiscent of [[Silent film|silent cinema]]. Another parallel is with Renoir's film ''[[Partie de campagne]]'', filmed in 1936, and the similarities in its portrayal of eroticism.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The filmmaker [[Shirley Clarke]] said that ''Picnic on the Grass'' \"could only have been made by someone of 6 or 60\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=354}}\n\n===European integration===\nThe historian Hugo Frey groups ''Picnic on the Grass'' with a number of French comedies that deal with a \"modernist invasion\".{{sfn|Frey|2014|p=119}} These include the films of [[Jacques Tati]], ''[[Mr. Freedom]]'' (1968) by [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]] and ''[[The Holes]]'' (1974) by [[Pierre Tchernia]]. Renoir's film stands out in the group because it targets the nascent [[European Union]] rather than the United States.{{sfn|Frey|2014|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nThe vision of a European [[superstate]] was conceived as the logical continuation of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), created in 1957 by the [[Treaty of Rome]]. The film's depiction of a French and German elite couple follows a convention where [[European integration]] is understood as something that particularly concerns France and Germany, or France and [[Germanic-speaking Europe]] overall. The way \u00c9tienne speaks to journalists, with technical and obscure terminology, envisions a future political elite as the only people who will comprehend the European project.{{sfn|Rivi\u00e8re|2018|pp=49\u201350}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter working in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] in the 1940s, Renoir had re-established himself in European cinema following the international success of ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'' (1951). During the 1950s, he developed a more detached and depoliticized approach to filmmaking than before. Simultaneously, he became a more prominent celebrity in France due to television appearances and an increased appreciation for his films from the 1930s. His work became more oriented toward personal subjects.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=328\u2013329}}\n\nThe title of ''Picnic on the Grass'' is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1863) by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Renoir wrote seven versions of the screenplay.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} He made the film through his own production company, Compagnie Jean Renoir; it was the last time he did that, as annoyances about logistics during the production made him decide to never produce his own films again. In addition to financial backing from [[Path\u00e9]] and the UCIF, Renoir offered 50% of his earnings from ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' (1937) as a [[reimbursement]] guarantee, to a limit of 10 million [[French franc|francs]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}}\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Catherine Rouvel]]\u2014whose real last name was Rouveyre\u2014had her first major role in ''Picnic on the Grass''. Renoir had met her in 1958, shortly after her 19th birthday, during a tribute to [[Robert J. Flaherty]] at the [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]]. She accompanied her husband Georges Rouveyre, whose friend Claude Beylie, who was a film critic, introduced her to Renoir. She had enrolled at the drama school Centre d'art dramatique de la rue Blanche a few weeks earlier. The same winter, Renoir contacted her for a reading and a screen test.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=697}} Before she won the role of N\u00e9nette, Renoir considered giving it to the dancer [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]], whom he had directed in a ballet. He also auditioned [[Mich\u00e8le Mercier]] the same day as Rouveyre. Renoir told Rouveyre in April 1959 that the role was hers. Soon thereafter he suggested that she should change her name to Rouvel.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} For the male lead, Renoir first considered [[Pierre Blanchar]], a man in his mid 60s, before he gave the role to the 20 years younger [[Paul Meurisse]]. Renoir had previously worked with Meurisse in a production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and the two were good friends.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} In the role of the goatherd Gaspard he cast [[Charles Blavette]], who had played the title role in Renoir's film ''[[Toni (1935 film)|Toni]]'' (1935).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nRenoir rehearsed with the actors for a week before adding technicians to the rehearsals. After this, the director, designer, camera operator and assistant scouted the filming locations. The rehearsals then resumed with markers chalked on the floor corresponding to the locations' topography.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} Working with markers was something Renoir abandoned after ''Picnic on the Grass'', because he thought it was better if the actors could discover the surroundings more freely.{{sfn|Renoir|1989|pp=185\u2013186}}\n\n===Filming and post-production===\n[[File:Cagnes-sur-Mer- Mus\u00e9e Renoir - Ferme -1.JPG|alt=Photograph of a stone house with three floors fronted by an old olive tree|thumb|The old farmhouse at Les Collettes was a filming location. The property was acquired by the city of Cagnes-sur-Mer in 1959 and turned into the Mus\u00e9e Renoir.{{sfn|Oddos|2016}}]]\nFilming took place from 6 to 30 July 1959 at Studio Franc\u0153ur in Paris, and in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]] and [[La Gaude]] in [[Alpes-Maritimes]].{{sfn|Cin\u00e9-Ressources}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' borrows visual traits from French [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting, and in particular that of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This is reflected in the choices of filming locations. Jean Renoir called the film \"something of a homage to the olive-trees under which my father worked so much\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}} A major location was the property Les Collettes in Cagnes-sur-Mer, which Renoir the elder had bought in 1907, and which had been the home of Jean Renoir for a part of his childhood and adolescence.{{sfnm|1a1=Durgnat|1y=1974|1p=347|2a1=M\u00e9rigeau|2y=2017|2p=700}} Renoir the elder had spent significant time in the town La Gaude where a part of the film was shot. Several of his paintings feature the nearby river Le Coup, which also appears in the film.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nAnother stylistic choice came from the director's desire to follow impulses on location and encourage improvisation. Renoir said he wanted to make a \"sort of filmed poem\" written in one sitting.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} After the rehearsals, he gave very little instruction to the actors.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} He used a rapid working method influenced by [[live television]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} Renoir had first used this technique in his recent television film ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'', which he called an \"experimental film\".{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=276}} He took advantage of the cinematographer's experience from making [[newsreel]] footage. [[Multiple-camera setup|Six cameras were placed around the scene]] to cover all useful angles and shots.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} In addition to saving time and money, the ambition was to retain the uninterrupted, intensive acting of a [[long take]] and still be able to make cuts within the scene.{{sfn|Renoir|1974|pp=276\u2013277}} The method made it possible to record most of the dialogue directly, without problems of continuity due to surrounding sounds such as those from airplanes. Up to twelve microphones were present and only around 20 phrases had to be dubbed in post-production.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}}\n\nSeveral key crew members were reused from ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment''. They included the cinematographer Georges Leclerc and the editor Ren\u00e9e Lichtig. Both would work with Renoir again on his next film, ''[[The Elusive Corporal]]'', which became his final feature film.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The working method was however not used again.{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=277}} The original music was composed by [[Joseph Kosma]], who first collaborated with Renoir in 1936 and had provided music for several of his best known films.{{sfn|Hischak|2015|p=412}} The score for ''Picnic on the Grass'' includes a melody the goatherd plays in high pitch on his flute during the wind scene, an upbeat piece played on clarinet in jazz style, and a melody played on flute with harp [[glissando]]s during a lyrical passage.{{sfn|Hischak|2015|p=413}}\n\n==Release==\nPath\u00e9 released ''Picnic on the Grass'' theatrically in France on 11 November 1959.{{sfn|Faulkner|1979|p=160}} In the United Kingdom it was released by Mondial Films in April 1960 under the title ''Lunch on the Grass''.{{sfn|British Board of Film Classification}} It was released in the United States as ''Picnic on the Grass'' on 12 October 1960 by [[Kingsley-International Pictures]].{{sfn|Faulkner|1979|p=160}}\n\nFor the French home-media market, it was first released on [[VHS]] in 1990 by Fil \u00e0 film and on [[DVD]] in 2003 by [[StudioCanal|StudioCanal vid\u00e9o]]. The DVD, which was re-released in 2008, includes a 30-minute documentary directed by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Glaymann.{{sfn|BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral}} The film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2007 by [[StudioCanal UK|Optimum Releasing]], as part of a box set with other Renoir films. The DVD uses the original French title, ''Le D\u00e9jeuner Sur L'Herbe''.{{sfn|French|2007}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Contemporary critical response===\nFrench film critics generally gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a positive reception, characterized by respect for Renoir. They highlighted the film's connection to impressionism and described it as charming.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=356}} Rouvel's face was on the cover of the December 1959 issue of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', and the magazine called the film \"the most beautiful of a month rich in masterpieces\".{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959|loc=inside of the front cover}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Pour l'\u00e9quipe des \u00ab Cahiers \u00bb et le Conseil des Dix, le film de Jean Renoir est le plus beau d'un mois riche en chefs-d'\u0153uvre.}}}} The review by [[\u00c9ric Rohmer]] stressed the technical novelty of the film, released in \"the year of the '[[French New Wave|New Wave]]'\", which Renoir had influenced profoundly.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=2}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... l'ann\u00e9e de la \u00ab nouvelle vague \u00bb ...}}}} With its detached and intentionally naive style, Rohmer described it as \"avant-garde popular theater\" in the vein of ''[[Mr Puntila and his Man Matti]]''.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=4}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... th\u00e9\u00e2tre populaire d'avant-garde ...}}}} For Rohmer, the satire against science should be understood through Renoir's role as an artist, not philosopher or moralist, and not as a rejection of practical science.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=6}} As for politics, he defended the artist's right to look at the problems of the world without being politically engaged.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=7}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' made 13th place on ''Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma'''s composite list of the best films of 1959.{{sfn|Hillier|1985|p=287}} [[Pierre Braunberger]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Jacques Rivette]], Rohmer and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] were among the ''Cahiers'' critics who named it to year-end top ten lists.{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n[[File:Jean Renoir (1959).tif|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of Jean Renoir in his mid 60s|Jean Renoir in 1959]]\nRenoir had supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in the 1930s, but ''Picnic on the Grass'' received negative reviews from critics with [[Communism|communist]] sympathies. It was released at a time when the PCF idealized progress and its members were enthusiastic about the [[Soviet space program]].{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=328 and 340}} Samuel Lachize of ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' considered the film flawed on a technical level, and criticized its lack of a clear choice between scientific progress and the rejection of it. He dismissed the philosophical content, which he took as a pseudo-[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauesque]] message about going [[back to nature]].{{sfn|Lachize|1959|p=2|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Marie|2013|pp=338\u2013339}}}} ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'' received a similar treatment from communist critics.{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=339\u2013340}} Left-wing critics also criticized ''Picnic on the Grass'' for its eventual acceptance of a European superstate, which was taken as an approval of the EEC, opposed by the left at the time. Furthermore upsetting for the left, the reservations \u00c9tienne develops were interpreted as support for [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s {{lang|fr|Europe des patries}} (\"Europe of fatherlands\").{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=350\u2013352}} In the 1970s, the film critic [[Raymond Durgnat]] related the response to the left's own struggle to oppose the EEC without turning to patriotism. Durgnat wrote that it was \"perhaps not too unkind to suggest that my left-wing colleagues were making their 'lost leader' a scapegoat for the very real difficulties of the left itself\u2014or should one say the lefts themselves?\"{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=352}}\n\nGideon Bachmann wrote in ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' that many American critics gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a \"silly treatment\", because they did not understand it through its director as a person. He used [[Hollis Alpert]] of the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' as a positive counterexample.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} Alpert called it \"a nonsensically unconventional movie\" where viewers \"would be better off not trying to make sense or logic out of it, but simply allowing M. Renoir to have his day in the fields\".{{sfn|Alpert|1960|p=34}} Bachmann wrote that the film is reminiscent of Tati's films, both in message and how the message is conveyed through colors.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} He contrasted the seeming simplicity with the serious content, and the impressionism with the surreal elements. He called it \"almost facile in impact but lasting in the perturbations it causes\".{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=41}}\n\n===Retrospective critical response===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' has received little attention from general audiences over time, but it has been embraced by individual critics.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} In 2006, Luc Arbona of ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' called it an \"extraordinary pamphlet\" portraying \"the peddlers of progress\" who \"only care about security, asepticity and uniformity\".{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Renoir r\u00e9alise ici un extraordinaire pamphlet o\u00f9 il met en sc\u00e8ne les camelots du progr\u00e8s qui se contrefoutent du monde, de la nature et ne se soucient que de s\u00e9curisation, d'aseptisation et d'uniformisation.}}}} Arbona called the satire \"abuntant and exhilirating\" and the film \"brilliantly prophetic\", because by the time of his writing, Arbona wrote, \"these progress-obsessed, these ad-agency apostles who have nothing but the politically correct to say, have seized power and are leading the dance.\"{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Satire foisonnante et jubilatoire, Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe est g\u00e9nialement proph\u00e9tique.

Taking its message as a rejection of modern technology, he still compared it favorably to [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Contagion (2011 film)|Contagion]]'', which shows science and the government triumphant in a crisis of natural origin. Brody made a point of separating art and politics: \"Looking to filmmakers for practical advice in the teeth of trouble is usually as pointless as turning to politicians for visions of beauty.\"{{sfn|Brody|2012}} ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' called it \"one of Renoir's most ravishing, and simultaneously most irritating films\", because the \"sumptuous photography\" repeatedly \"collapses into cold argument\".{{sfn|Time Out}}\n\n===Box office===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' had 757,024 admissions in France.{{sfn|AlloCin\u00e9}} It was a commercial failure. Renoir addressed this in a letter to the producer Ginette Doynel a few weeks after the Paris premiere. He wrote that the failure had given him a distaste for film and television work in general. He would instead focus on his teaching position at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], his plays, and his book about his father.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' later had a significant theatrical run in the United States, which delighted Renoir.{{sfn|Silke|2005|p=134}}\n\n==Legacy==\nRouvel signed an unusual contract which had the practical effect that Renoir had to approve all her engagements for the next three years. Renoir decided to keep her away from the film industry and only accepted offers of theater roles. He rejected roles in ''[[The Green Mare (film)|The Green Mare]]'' and a film by [[G\u00e9rard Oury]]. Rouvel returned to film acting in [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Landru (film)|Bluebeard]]'', released in January 1963.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=699\u2013700}}\n\nThe film ''[[Le Bonheur (1965 film)|Le Bonheur]]'' (1965) directed by [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] pays tribute to ''Picnic on the Grass'' by including a passage which plays on a television screen.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=734}} The film scholar Nancy Pogel argues in her book on [[Woody Allen]] that Allen's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' (1982) is indebted to ''Picnic on the Grass''.{{sfn|Nichols|2000|p=95}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Farm at Les Collettes, Cagnes]]''\n* [[France\u2013Germany relations]]\n* [[Pan in popular culture]]\n* [[Physis]] and [[techne]]\n* [[Reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction]]\n\n==References==\n===Original quotations===\n{{notelist}}\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite web |author=[[AlloCin\u00e9]] |url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208035056/http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |publisher=Tiger Global |archive-date=8 December 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=CITEREFAlloCin\u00e9 }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Alpert |first=Hollis |authorlink=Hollis Alpert |date=15 October 1960 |url=https://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1960oct15-00034/ |title=Panic on the Grass |work=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Arbona |first=Luc |date=17 August 2006 |url=https://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/films-a-l-affiche/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe/ |title=le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |work=[[Les Inrockuptibles]] |language=French |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |last=Bachmann |first=Gideon |year=1960 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pp=40\u201341 |doi=10.2307/1210350 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral |url=https://data.bnf.fr/en/16179534/le_dejeuner_sur_l_herbe___film/ |title=Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe : film |publisher=[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/lunch-grass-1959 |title=Lunch on the Grass |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Film Institute]] |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a8a022a |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |accessdate=18 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Brody |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Brody |date=29 October 2012 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/watching-sandy-with-jean-renoir |title=Watching Sandy with Jean Renoir |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |date=December 1959 |title=Notre couverture |trans-title=Our cover |journal=[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]] |language=French |issue=102 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959 }}\n\n: {{cite journal |date=February 1960 |title=Les dix meilleurs films de l'ann\u00e9e |trans-title=The ten best films of the year |journal=Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma |language=French |issue=104 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960 }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[Cin\u00e9-Ressources]] |url=http://cinema.encyclopedie.films.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=50831 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |publisher=[[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]] |accessdate=26 February 2020 |ref=CITEREFCin\u00e9-Ressources }}\n\n: {{cite book |last=Douchet |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Douchet |year=1974 |chapter=Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe (1959) (Picnic on the Grass, 1960) |editor-last=Truffaut |editor-first=Fran\u00e7ois |editorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |translator1-last=Halsey II |translator1-first=W.

It is known in the United Kingdom by its original title or in translation as '''''Lunch on the Grass'''''. A satire on contemporary science and politics, it revolves around a prominent biologist and politician who wants to replace sex with [[artificial insemination]], but begins to reconsider when a picnic he organizes is interrupted by the forces of nature. The film brings up issues of [[modernity]], [[human reproduction]], youth and [[European integration]]. It ridicules [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] and celebrates a type of [[materialism]] it associates with [[classical mythology]] and [[ancient Greek philosophy]].\n\nThe title is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' by [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. The female lead in ''Picnic on the Grass'' was the first major role for Rouvel, who due to an unusual contract would not appear in another film until 1963. Filming took place around Renoir's childhood home in [[Provence]], and inspiration came from the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] paintings of his father, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. The filming technique was influenced by [[live television]] and involved [[Multiple-camera setup|multiple cameras]] and direct audio recording.\n\nThe press reviews were generally positive and described the film as charming and beautiful. Negative response came from the political left, where critics disapproved of the film's treatment of [[progress]] and depiction of a European [[superstate]]. The subject of European unification was topical and sensitive due to the creation of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957. The film was a commercial failure and has attracted little attention from general audiences over the years.\n\n==Plot==\nThe famous biologist \u00c9tienne Alexis is the frontrunner in the upcoming election of the first President of [[United States of Europe|Europe]]. He advocates mandatory [[artificial insemination]] in order to [[Eugenics|improve humanity]] and make it worthy of modern science. He is newly engaged to his German cousin Marie-Charlotte and has invited her to a picnic near his mansion in [[Provence]].\n\nN\u00e9nette, a farmer's daughter, is disappointed with men after a failed relationship. She still wants children and applies to be a test subject for \u00c9tienne's insemination project. She ends up hired as his chambermaid and accompanies the picnic with the other servants. Present at the picnic are several cousins from both France and Germany. They are all stiff, rationally minded and profess belief in scientific [[progress]]. They have invited journalists to document the event as a symbol for the new unified Europe. The picnic takes place next to the ruins of a temple of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the goddess who the ancient Romans believed presided over childbirth. Nearby is also a group of young campers. N\u00e9nette is worried when she spots the goatherd Gaspard. She knows that when Gaspard plays his flute, strange things tend to happen. Gaspard plays and suddenly a strong wind blows away the picnic chairs and tables. As everybody takes cover, \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette are separated from the rest.\n\nWhen the wind subsides, they are invited to sit down with the campers. \u00c9tienne explains to the youth how he hopes to eliminate passion. Meanwhile, a [[Bacchanalia]] breaks out among the picnic guests not far away. Leaving the campers to look for Marie-Charlotte, \u00c9tienne ends up seeing N\u00e9nette [[Nude swimming|swimming nude]]. Shortly thereafter, Gaspard plays his flute again, and \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette run off into the high reeds. After returning, the two see the cousins and servants leaving in cars. They choose to not approach them and instead rejoin the campers, who offer them to stay the night in their camp. The next morning, \u00c9tienne says he wants to escape from the world for a while, so he and N\u00e9nette go to stay at N\u00e9nette's father Nino's house. \u00c9tienne begins to reconsider the relationship between humans and the natural world. The cousins eventually locate him and come to Nino's house. They convince N\u00e9nette to leave. Realizing she is gone, \u00c9tienne becomes agitated and goes to look for her. Gaspard, the goatherd, recommends him to kneel before his goat and ask for help. After doing so, \u00c9tienne turns ecstatic and shouts \"Down with science!\" before his cousins capture him.\n\n\u00c9tienne goes back to his old life, but on the day of his wedding he discovers N\u00e9nette working in a hotel kitchen. She is happily pregnant with his child. He abruptly brings her, not Marie-Charlotte, to the waiting crowd. He will launch his presidential campaign with a speech about science and nature, and he intends to marry N\u00e9nette.\n\n==Cast==\nCast adapted from ''A Companion to Jean Renoir'' and the [[British Film Institute]].{{sfnm|1a1=Phillips|1a2=Vincendeau|1y=2013|1p=583|2a1=British Film Institute}}\n* [[Paul Meurisse]] as Professor \u00c9tienne Alexis\n* [[Catherine Rouvel]] as N\u00e9nette\n* [[Fernand Sardou]] as Nino, N\u00e9nette's father\n* Jacqueline Morane as Titine, N\u00e9nette's elder sister\n* [[Jean-Pierre Granval]] as Ritou, Titine's husband\n* Ingrid Nordine as Marie-Charlotte\n* [[Charles Blavette]] as Gaspard, the old goatherd\n* [[Paulette Dubost]] as Mlle Forestier, the telephonist\n\n==Themes==\n===Modernity and nature===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 020.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Oil painting of a nude woman who sits on a rock and leans on a bow. At her feet is a dead deer with its neck pierced by an arrow.|''[[Diana (Renoir painting)|Diana]]'' by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1867]]\nThe themes of ''Picnic on the Grass'' revolve around modern issues such as artificial insemination, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and the [[mass media]]. [[Jean Renoir]]'s biographer [[Pascal M\u00e9rigeau]] writes that the film \"deals with disturbingly serious subjects using a farcical tone\".{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The film historian [[Jean Douchet]] writes that the film should be taken seriously, but describes its story as an invitation to not do so.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=295}} Renoir satirizes a [[modernity]] he does not think highly of, and uses story and tone to tell the viewer that it is not very important.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=700\u2013701}}\n\nThe central conflict is built on several [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]: between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]], the [[Technocracy|technocratic]] [[Northern Europe]] and underdeveloped [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]], and the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] of [[Postchristianity]] and [[Materialism|materialist]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy of ancient Greece]].{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=298\u2013299}} The film ridicules the idealist notion of progress and celebrates the Dionysian world.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} It portrays an empty spirituality produced by a bureaucratic [[utilitarianism]], and thereby seeks to justify the celebration of a material world imbued with spirit.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=349}} When \u00c9tienne converses with a Christian priest, the two are shown to have disagreements, but to simultaneously understand each other well. This is because both still belong to the idealist side in the film's conflict.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} According to Douchet, the film sets up a scenario where harmonious equilibrium is achieved when science abandons idealism and submits to a materialist view of nature. This happens when \u00c9tienne marries N\u00e9nette who is pregnant with their naturally conceived child.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=299\u2013300}}\n\n\u00c9tienne is an intellectual who lives in a theoretical world. This makes him similar to the main characters in two earlier works by Renoir: the play ''Orvet'' (1955) and the television film ''[[The Doctor's Horrible Experiment]]'' (1959).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=314}} \u00c9tienne's eugenic ideology combines rationalism and [[moralism]] in a way that gives [[Darwinism]] an active role in concord with [[individualism]]. [[Human reproduction]] and [[Human evolution|evolution]] become tied to \u00c9tienne's own [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficiency]] and to ideas about social responsibility.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=349\u2013350}} N\u00e9nette is comfortable with her human physicality, but is also driven by self-sufficiency in her wish to have her own child through artificial insemination. She is [[Emancipation|emancipated]] and mobile, and it is her actions that twice bring her to \u00c9tienne. Another\u2014militaristic\u2014type of women's emancipation is represented by Marie-Charlotte.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}} Allied against Western rationalism are the gods [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and Diana. Pan is evoked through the flute-playing goatherd, and Diana presides over [[chastity]] and childbirth, which in this [[Classical mythology|classical mythological]] context are aspects of female independence.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}}\n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Renoir - PORTRAIT DE JEAN RENOIR, 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painted bust portrait of Jean Renoir as a young boy|Portrait of Jean Renoir by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1910]]\nRenoir had spent years of his childhood and adolescence in the area where ''Picnic on the Grass'' was filmed.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} He had recently begun to write a book about his father, the painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], which made him reminisce about his early life.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Accordng to M\u00e9rigeau, the film was a way for Renoir to confront the boy he once was with the troubling questions of the contemporary world. Renoir's reconnection to his young self is paralleled in the mode of storytelling which is reminiscent of [[Silent film|silent cinema]]. Another parallel is with Renoir's film ''[[Partie de campagne]]'', filmed in 1936, and the similarities in its portrayal of eroticism.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The filmmaker [[Shirley Clarke]] said that ''Picnic on the Grass'' \"could only have been made by someone of 6 or 60\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=354}}\n\n===European integration===\nThe historian Hugo Frey groups ''Picnic on the Grass'' with a number of French comedies that deal with a \"modernist invasion\".{{sfn|Frey|2014|p=119}} These include the films of [[Jacques Tati]], ''[[Mr. Freedom]]'' (1968) by [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]] and ''[[The Holes]]'' (1974) by [[Pierre Tchernia]]. Renoir's film stands out in the group because it targets the nascent [[European Union]] rather than the United States.{{sfn|Frey|2014|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nThe vision of a European [[superstate]] was conceived as the logical continuation of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), created in 1957 by the [[Treaty of Rome]]. The film's depiction of a French and German elite couple follows a convention where [[European integration]] is understood as something that particularly concerns France and Germany, or France and [[Germanic-speaking Europe]] overall. The way \u00c9tienne speaks to journalists, with technical and obscure terminology, envisions a future political elite as the only people who will comprehend the European project.{{sfn|Rivi\u00e8re|2018|pp=49\u201350}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter working in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] in the 1940s, Renoir had re-established himself in European cinema following the international success of ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'' (1951). During the 1950s, he developed a more detached and depoliticized approach to filmmaking than before. Simultaneously, he became a more prominent celebrity in France due to television appearances and an increased appreciation for his films from the 1930s. His work became more oriented toward personal subjects.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=328\u2013329}}\n\nThe title of ''Picnic on the Grass'' is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1863) by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Renoir wrote seven versions of the screenplay.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} He made the film through his own production company, Compagnie Jean Renoir; it was the last time he did that, as annoyances about logistics during the production made him decide to never produce his own films again. In addition to financial backing from [[Path\u00e9]] and the UCIF, Renoir offered 50% of his earnings from ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' (1937) as a [[reimbursement]] guarantee, to a limit of 10 million [[French franc|francs]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}}\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Catherine Rouvel]]\u2014whose real last name was Rouveyre\u2014had her first major role in ''Picnic on the Grass''. Renoir had met her in 1958, shortly after her 19th birthday, during a tribute to [[Robert J. Flaherty]] at the [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]]. She accompanied her husband Georges Rouveyre whose friend Claude Beylie, who was a film critic, introduced her to Renoir. She had enrolled at the drama school Centre d'art dramatique de la rue Blanche a few weeks earlier. The same winter, Renoir contacted her for a reading and a screen test.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=697}} Before she won the role of N\u00e9nette, Renoir considered giving it to the dancer [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]], whom he had directed in a ballet. He also auditioned [[Mich\u00e8le Mercier]] the same day as Rouveyre. Renoir told Rouveyre in April 1959 that the role was hers. Soon thereafter he suggested that she should change her name to Rouvel.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} For the male lead, Renoir first considered [[Pierre Blanchar]], a man in his mid 60s, before he gave the role to the 20 years younger [[Paul Meurisse]]. Renoir had previously worked with Meurisse in a production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and the two were good friends.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} In the role of the goatherd Gaspard he cast [[Charles Blavette]], who had played the title role in Renoir's film ''[[Toni (1935 film)|Toni]]'' (1935).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nRenoir rehearsed with the actors for a week before adding technicians to the rehearsals. After this, the director, designer, camera operator and assistant scouted the filming locations. The rehearsals then resumed with markers chalked on the floor corresponding to the locations' topography.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} Working with markers was something Renoir abandoned after ''Picnic on the Grass'', because he thought it was better if the actors could discover the surroundings more freely.{{sfn|Renoir|1989|pp=185\u2013186}}\n\n===Filming and post-production===\n[[File:Cagnes-sur-Mer- Mus\u00e9e Renoir - Ferme -1.JPG|alt=Photograph of a stone house with three floors fronted by an old olive tree|thumb|The old farmhouse at Les Collettes was a filming location. The property was acquired by the city of Cagnes-sur-Mer in 1959 and turned into the Mus\u00e9e Renoir.{{sfn|Oddos|2016}}]]\nFilming took place from 6 to 30 July 1959 at Studio Franc\u0153ur in Paris, and in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]] and [[La Gaude]] in [[Alpes-Maritimes]].{{sfn|Cin\u00e9-Ressources}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' borrows visual traits from French [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting, and in particular that of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This is reflected in the choices of filming locations. Jean Renoir called the film \"something of a homage to the olive-trees under which my father worked so much\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}} A major location was the property Les Collettes in Cagnes-sur-Mer, which Renoir the elder had bought in 1907, and which had been the home of Jean Renoir for a part of his childhood and adolescence.{{sfnm|1a1=Durgnat|1y=1974|1p=347|2a1=M\u00e9rigeau|2y=2017|2p=700}} Renoir the elder had spent significant time in the town La Gaude where a part of the film was shot. Several of his paintings feature the nearby river Le Coup, which also appears in the film.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nAnother stylistic choice came from the director's desire to follow impulses on location and encourage improvisation. Renoir said he wanted to make a \"sort of filmed poem\" written in one sitting.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} After the rehearsals, he gave very little instruction to the actors.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} He used a rapid working method influenced by [[live television]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} Renoir had first used this technique in his recent television film ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'', which he called an \"experimental film\".{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=276}} He took advantage of the cinematographer's experience from making [[newsreel]] footage. [[Multiple-camera setup|Six cameras were placed around the scene]] to cover all useful angles and shots.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} In addition to saving time and money, the ambition was to retain the uninterrupted, intensive acting of a [[long take]] and still be able to make cuts within the scene.{{sfn|Renoir|1974|pp=276\u2013277}} The method made it possible to record most of the dialogue directly, without problems of continuity due to surrounding sounds such as those from airplanes. Up to twelve microphones were present and only around 20 phrases had to be dubbed in post-production.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}}\n\nSeveral key crew members were reused from ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment''. They included the cinematographer Georges Leclerc and the editor Ren\u00e9e Lichtig. Both would work with Renoir again on his next film, ''[[The Elusive Corporal]]'', which became his final feature film.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The working method was however not used again.{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=277}} The original music was composed by [[Joseph Kosma]], who first collaborated with Renoir in 1936 and had provided music for several of his best known films.{{sfn|Hischak|2015|p=412}} The score for ''Picnic on the Grass'' includes a melody the goatherd plays in high pitch on his flute during the wind scene, an upbeat piece played on clarinet in jazz style, and a melody played on flute with harp [[glissando]]s during a lyrical passage.{{sfn|Hischak|2015|p=413}}\n\n==Release==\nPath\u00e9 released ''Picnic on the Grass'' theatrically in France on 11 November 1959.{{sfn|Faulkner|1979|p=160}} In the United Kingdom it was released by Mondial Films in April 1960 under the title ''Lunch on the Grass''.{{sfn|British Board of Film Classification}} It was released in the United States as ''Picnic on the Grass'' on 12 October 1960 by [[Kingsley-International Pictures]].{{sfn|Faulkner|1979|p=160}}\n\nFor the French home-media market, it was first released on [[VHS]] in 1990 by Fil \u00e0 film and on [[DVD]] in 2003 by [[StudioCanal|StudioCanal vid\u00e9o]]. The DVD, which was re-released in 2008, includes a 30-minute documentary directed by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Glaymann.{{sfn|BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral}} The film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2007 by [[StudioCanal UK|Optimum Releasing]], as part of a box set with other Renoir films. The DVD uses the original French title, ''Le D\u00e9jeuner Sur L'Herbe''.{{sfn|French|2007}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Contemporary critical response===\nFrench film critics generally gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a positive reception, characterized by respect for Renoir. They highlighted the film's connection to impressionism and described it as charming.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=356}} Rouvel's face was on the cover of the December 1959 issue of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', and the magazine called the film \"the most beautiful of a month rich in masterpieces\".{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959|loc=inside of the front cover}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Pour l'\u00e9quipe des \u00ab Cahiers \u00bb et le Conseil des Dix, le film de Jean Renoir est le plus beau d'un mois riche en chefs-d'\u0153uvre.}}}} The review by [[\u00c9ric Rohmer]] stressed the technical novelty of the film, released in \"the year of the '[[French New Wave|New Wave]]'\", which Renoir had influenced profoundly.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=2}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... l'ann\u00e9e de la \u00ab nouvelle vague \u00bb ...}}}} With its detached and intentionally naive style, Rohmer described it as \"avant-garde popular theater\" in the vein of ''[[Mr Puntila and his Man Matti]]''.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=4}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... th\u00e9\u00e2tre populaire d'avant-garde ...}}}} For Rohmer, the satire against science should be understood through Renoir's role as an artist, not philosopher or moralist, and not as a rejection of practical science.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=6}} As for politics, he defended the artist's right to look at the problems of the world without being politically engaged.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=7}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' made 13th place on ''Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma'''s composite list of the best films of 1959.{{sfn|Hillier|1985|p=287}} [[Pierre Braunberger]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Jacques Rivette]], Rohmer and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] were among the ''Cahiers'' critics who named it to year-end top ten lists.{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n[[File:Jean Renoir (1959).tif|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of Jean Renoir in his mid 60s|Jean Renoir in 1959]]\nRenoir had supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in the 1930s, but ''Picnic on the Grass'' received negative reviews from critics with [[Communism|communist]] sympathies. It was released at a time when the PCF idealized progress and its members were enthusiastic about the [[Soviet space program]].{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=328 and 340}} Samuel Lachize of ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' considered the film flawed on a technical level, and criticized its lack of a clear choice between scientific progress and the rejection of it. He dismissed the philosophical content, which he took as a pseudo-[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauesque]] message about going [[back to nature]].{{sfn|Lachize|1959|p=2|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Marie|2013|pp=338\u2013339}}}} ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'' received a similar treatment from communist critics.{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=339\u2013340}} Left-wing critics also criticized ''Picnic on the Grass'' for its eventual acceptance of a European superstate, which was taken as an approval of the EEC, opposed by the left at the time. Furthermore upsetting for the left, the reservations \u00c9tienne develops were interpreted as support for [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s {{lang|fr|Europe des patries}} (\"Europe of fatherlands\").{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=350\u2013352}} In the 1970s, the film critic [[Raymond Durgnat]] related the response to the left's own struggle to oppose the EEC without turning to patriotism. Durgnat wrote that it was \"perhaps not too unkind to suggest that my left-wing colleagues were making their 'lost leader' a scapegoat for the very real difficulties of the left itself\u2014or should one say the lefts themselves?\"{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=352}}\n\nGideon Bachmann wrote in ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' that many American critics gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a \"silly treatment\", because they did not understand it through its director as a person. He used [[Hollis Alpert]] of the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' as a positive counterexample.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} Alpert called it \"a nonsensically unconventional movie\" where viewers \"would be better off not trying to make sense or logic out of it, but simply allowing M. Renoir to have his day in the fields\".{{sfn|Alpert|1960|p=34}} Bachmann wrote that the film is reminiscent of Tati's films, both in message and how the message is conveyed through colors.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} He contrasted the seeming simplicity with the serious content, and the impressionism with the surreal elements. He called it \"almost facile in impact but lasting in the perturbations it causes\".{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=41}}\n\n===Retrospective critical response===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' has received little attention from general audiences over time, but it has been embraced by individual critics.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} In 2006, Luc Arbona of ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' called it an \"extraordinary pamphlet\" portraying \"the peddlers of progress\" who \"only care about security, asepticity and uniformity\".{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Renoir r\u00e9alise ici un extraordinaire pamphlet o\u00f9 il met en sc\u00e8ne les camelots du progr\u00e8s qui se contrefoutent du monde, de la nature et ne se soucient que de s\u00e9curisation, d'aseptisation et d'uniformisation.}}}} Arbona called the satire \"abuntant and exhilirating\" and the film \"brilliantly prophetic\", because by the time of his writing, Arbona wrote, \"these progress-obsessed, these ad-agency apostles who have nothing but the politically correct to say, have seized power and are leading the dance.\"{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Satire foisonnante et jubilatoire, Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe est g\u00e9nialement proph\u00e9tique.

Taking its message as a rejection of modern technology, he still compared it favorably to [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Contagion (2011 film)|Contagion]]'', which shows science and the government triumphant in a crisis of natural origin. Brody made a point of separating art and politics: \"Looking to filmmakers for practical advice in the teeth of trouble is usually as pointless as turning to politicians for visions of beauty.\"{{sfn|Brody|2012}} ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' called it \"one of Renoir's most ravishing, and simultaneously most irritating films\", because the \"sumptuous photography\" repeatedly \"collapses into cold argument\".{{sfn|Time Out}}\n\n===Box office===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' had 757,024 admissions in France.{{sfn|AlloCin\u00e9}} It was a commercial failure. Renoir addressed this in a letter to the producer Ginette Doynel a few weeks after the Paris premiere. He wrote that the failure had given him a distaste for film and television work in general. He would instead focus on his teaching position at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], his plays, and his book about his father.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' later had a significant theatrical run in the United States, which delighted Renoir.{{sfn|Silke|2005|p=134}}\n\n==Legacy==\nRouvel signed an unusual contract which had the practical effect that Renoir had to approve all her engagements for the next three years. Renoir decided to keep her away from the film industry and only accepted offers of theater roles. He rejected roles in ''[[The Green Mare (film)|The Green Mare]]'' and a film by [[G\u00e9rard Oury]]. Rouvel returned to film acting in [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Landru (film)|Bluebeard]]'', released in January 1963.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=699\u2013700}}\n\nThe film ''[[Le Bonheur (1965 film)|Le Bonheur]]'' (1965) directed by [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] pays tribute to ''Picnic on the Grass'' by including a passage which plays on a television screen.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=734}} The film scholar Nancy Pogel argues in her book on [[Woody Allen]] that Allen's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' (1982) is indebted to ''Picnic on the Grass''.{{sfn|Nichols|2000|p=95}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Farm at Les Collettes, Cagnes]]''\n* [[France\u2013Germany relations]]\n* [[Pan in popular culture]]\n* [[Physis]] and [[techne]]\n* [[Reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction]]\n\n==References==\n===Original quotations===\n{{notelist}}\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite web |author=[[AlloCin\u00e9]] |url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208035056/http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |publisher=Tiger Global |archive-date=8 December 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=CITEREFAlloCin\u00e9 }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Alpert |first=Hollis |authorlink=Hollis Alpert |date=15 October 1960 |url=https://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1960oct15-00034/ |title=Panic on the Grass |work=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Arbona |first=Luc |date=17 August 2006 |url=https://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/films-a-l-affiche/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe/ |title=le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |work=[[Les Inrockuptibles]] |language=French |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |last=Bachmann |first=Gideon |year=1960 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pp=40\u201341 |doi=10.2307/1210350 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral |url=https://data.bnf.fr/en/16179534/le_dejeuner_sur_l_herbe___film/ |title=Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe : film |publisher=[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/lunch-grass-1959 |title=Lunch on the Grass |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Film Institute]] |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a8a022a |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |accessdate=18 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Brody |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Brody |date=29 October 2012 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/watching-sandy-with-jean-renoir |title=Watching Sandy with Jean Renoir |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |date=December 1959 |title=Notre couverture |trans-title=Our cover |journal=[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]] |language=French |issue=102 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959 }}\n\n: {{cite journal |date=February 1960 |title=Les dix meilleurs films de l'ann\u00e9e |trans-title=The ten best films of the year |journal=Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma |language=French |issue=104 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960 }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[Cin\u00e9-Ressources]] |url=http://cinema.encyclopedie.films.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=50831 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |publisher=[[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]] |accessdate=26 February 2020 |ref=CITEREFCin\u00e9-Ressources }}\n\n: {{cite book |last=Douchet |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Douchet |year=1974 |chapter=Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe (1959) (Picnic on the Grass, 1960) |editor-last=Truffaut |editor-first=Fran\u00e7ois |editorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |translator1-last=Halsey II |translator1-first=W.

This launched her long running International career, performing at dance venues and festivals in Europe, South America, Asia, and Africa. In 1992 she performed at a [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] concert in [[Brussels]]. Together with Eric Nouhan, Isis received her first production assignment in 1995 given by [[Bols (brand)|Bols]]. From 1995 until 2000 Isis became a resident DJ at Amsterdam club ''Chemistry'' (aka 'Escape', [[Rembrandtplein]]). In 1995 she was contracted by [[EMI]], [[Virgin Records|Virgin]], [[Ariola]], and [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. In 1996 and 1997 Isis\u2019 mix albums (\"100% Isis 1\" and \"100% Isis 2\") were ranked on various Electronic dance music national top ten charts. At the World [[Expo '98]] in Lisbon Portugal, Isis performed as an official representative of the Netherlands. Isis was subsequently asked to perform during [[Holland Festival]] in 2000. Her mix album \"Reformation\" was ranked in the top ten mix albums of 2001. In 2002 her talent was recognized globally and she was ranked in top ten of worldwide female Tech-House DJ's. In 2003 she was ranked in the top 600 of the best DJ's worldwide. At the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|World Climate Summit 2009 in Copenhagen]] Isis achieved her audience capacity record, reaching up to 100,000 spectators.\nCrown Prince [[Willem Alexander]] was among the audience in 2010 as a special guest during an audio-visual performance by Isis at the [[Ridderzaal]].\n\n==Magma the Agency and All Is One==\nIn 2000 Isis van der Wel founded the event production and artist management company called \u2018Magma the Agency\u2019. Since 2003 Magma the Agency is organizing events under the name of 'All Is One'. Isis becomes responsible for programming and hosting an area at the world-renowned [[Mysteryland|Mystery Land]] festival from 2003 through 2008. With 'All Is One' she hosts successful events and club nights, such as All Is One Weekend and Amsterdams Glorie. Furthermore, Isis is commissioned as an art director and promoter for events like [[Amsterdam dance event]] and Museumnacht Amsterdam.\n\n==All Is One Records==\nIn 2006 \u2018All Is One Records\u2019 was officially established. In 2008 'All is One' celebrated its first releases and presents the productions of young upcoming DJs and producers such as Arjuna Schiks and Daniel Zuur. The singles released build a bridge between different genres like [[Techno]], [[House music|House]], [[Ambient music|Ambient]] and [[Experimental music|Experimental]] [[Dance music]].\n\n==Ambassador of Liberty==\nThe [[Nationaal Comit\u00e9 4 en 5 mei|national 5 May committee]] declared Isis as ''Ambassador of Liberty'' for the May 5 Dutch Independence day of 2009. This honourable title allowed her to join the queen for the annual May 4 [[Remembrance of the Dead|Remembrance ceremony]], continued by performing five big shows throughout the country on the next day, when May 5 national liberation day music festivals are held in prominent cities throughout the country.\n\n==Nachtburgemeester Amsterdam (Nightlife Ambassador)==\nIsis was elected as the Nachtburgermeester of Amsterdam (Nightlife Ambassador) in 2010, and served as such for its 2-year term. Her function was to monitor the nightlife of Amsterdam and to build bridges between local politicians, entrepreneurs, artists and its audience. During her term she joined, and continued to be a part of, an expert team led by [[Eberhard van der Laan]] (Mayor of Amsterdam) to approve 24-hour permits for specific dance venues throughout the city.\n\n==Magneet Festival==\nAnother result of Isis\u2019 Ambassadorship is the realization of the Magneet festival. Magneet Festival is a crowd-sourced festival that uses an online co-creation platform in order to assist in the programming of the event, a pioneering concept in Europe.\n\n==Zevenmanschap==\nIn 2011 she joined the \u2018Zevenmanschap\u2019, a committee headed by [[Andr\u00e9e van Es]] and aimed at raising awareness of tolerance and discrimination in Amsterdam. It consists of seven key figures from Amsterdam of diverse cultural and religious backgrounds.\n\n==Lifetime achievement award==\nIsis wins the Life Time Achievement Award in 2011 during the annual GK Awards for her outstanding achievements during her career as a prominent professional in the Dutch nightlife. Currently, Isis is extending her career to television, where she appears in several [[BNN (Dutch broadcaster)|BNN]] TV shows, like \u2018Vier Handen op 1 Buik\u2019.\n\n==20-Year Anniversary==\nIn April 2012, Isis celebrated her 20th year in the DJ business in [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]], marking her overall time in the business as one of the first professional women in worldwide dance culture, as well as an important member of the Dutch nightlife scene.\n\n==From 100% Isis to Isis==\nIn August 2006 Isis decided to change her alias. When she started back in 1991, she got the name ''100% Isis''. After 15 years she decided to stop using it and she prefers to be called ''Isis'' ever since. What she had to say about it:\n\n{{quote|100% ISIS has been my nickname since I was sixteen years old, like [[Lange Frans (rapper)|Lange Frans]] & [[50 Cent]] are aliases.

{"title_page": "NCAA Football 07", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=May 2012}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title=NCAA Football 07\n|image=NCAA Football 07 Coverart.jpg\n|developer=[[EA Tiburon]]\n|publisher=[[EA Sports]]\n|designer=\n|engine=\n|released=July 18, 2006\n|genre=[[Sports game|Sports]], [[American football]]\n|modes=[[single-player video game|Single player]], [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]], multiplayer online\n|platforms=[[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]\n}}\n\n'''''NCAA Football 07''''' is a [[college football|collegiate football]] [[video game]] published by [[Electronic Arts]]. It is the successor to ''[[NCAA Football 06]]'' in the ''[[NCAA Football series|NCAA Football]]'' series. The product features former [[University of Southern California|USC]] player [[Reggie Bush]] on the cover. While there weren't any new, major features added to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox games, tweaks were added to improve the existing features.\n\nThe theme for ''07'' is \"Turn the Tide\". Like [[NCAA Football 2005|the 2005 version]] said for home-field advantage, this year's version emphasizes that momentum is more important in college football than any other sport. This is illustrated by a momentum meter on the score graphic at the top (or bottom, in the case of the Xbox 360 version) of the screen. The more the meter is shifted towards a team, the better its players will perform (ex. If the momentum bar is all the way full with a +5 number below it (or above it), all players on the team will have their attributes boosted 5 points).\n\n''NCAA Football 07'' also includes spring drills, an update to Race for the Heisman mode called Campus Legend (which plays more like NFL Superstar mode in ''[[Madden NFL 07|Madden]]''), [[ESPN]] integration, and a spring game in Dynasty and Campus Legend modes. ESPN integration is expected to increase with the next NCAA Football releases.\n\n\n==Campus Legend==\n\nCampus Legend, for the most part, runs on the same system as its predecessor, Race for the Heisman. One creates a player, goes to a football camp, performs in drills, and is awarded a scholarship to play for a Division 1-A program. However, changes begin right from the start of camp. \n<sup>Campus Legend was not available on the Xbox 360 Version of the game.</sup>\n\n===Camp===\nRather than picking one drill to participate in, the player participates in a series of four drills which vary by position. (e.g. player gains attribute points - one to sixteen points depending on the performance - by repeatedly tapping A on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] during the 40 Yard Dash.)\n\nPick a college\n\n[[Image:Ncaa 2007 screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Screenshot of in-game action between [[Virginia Tech]] and [[University of Virginia|Virginia]] at [[ Stadium]]]]\nAnother change in ''NCAA Football 07'' is which schools you can attend. Rather than choosing one of three scholarships or applying as a walk-on to another program, performance in camp determines your points and the distribution of those to your player will determine the caliber of your player (between one and five stars). This, in turn, determines how many of the 119 schools one can sign with and how highly those teams are ranked that you sign with. For example, a five-star recruit has the option to sign with any Division 1-A program of any rank and has a 50% popularity bonus, while a four-star recruit can sign with any Division 1-A program without the bonus. The lower the caliber, the fewer schools and lower rank one can choose from.\n\n===The Dorm===\nOnce moved into the dorm, a player is required to choose a major. While some are legitimate (e.g. chemistry, sports medicine, English), others are rather odd (e.g. [[ESPN]], 1-AA team nicknames, sports geography). Academic performance will improve a player's ratings, but one must choose a major that improves relevant ratings. For example, a quarterback would not want to major in something that would improve his tackling ability. In your dorm room, there is also a fan mailbox, where you can read generated mail from your fans. Also added is an NCAA progress report, where you can check your GPA, athletic goals, attribute point bonuses, and popularity; a computer to check rankings anywhere from the Heisman watch to All-Americans to the coaches' and AP polls; a closet to edit appearance, gear, and attribute points; and a school magazine chronicling headlines from your team (or, in case of a senior year, they will boast about the player).

Each weekday on the calendar in the dorm has a morning, afternoon, and evening event. The morning event is always classes (with the exception of the midterm and final exams), and is automatically simulated (unless it's an aforementioned test). The afternoon event is always practice, where one can earn attribute points if he performs well enough. The evening event gives the player a choice of studying (a pop-up on the screen that gives the answer to a potential exam question), meeting with a tutor (a two-night event where one receives a five-question quiz to improve his GPA), participating in a position drill (a two-night event where the player takes part in one of his position's four specific drills from camp to earn attribute points), or participating in a campus social activity, which boosts popularity. Weekends are simulated except for the game, if there is one that weekend.\n\n== ''NCAA Football 07'' on the Xbox 360 ==\nThe Xbox 360 version of the game was thought by many to be incomplete as it lacked features of the console versions such as Campus Legend mode and Spring Drills. However, the game featured several mini-games of its own such as [[bowling]], where the player is put at the 20-yard line of the opponent's end zone and a touchdown is considered a [[Strike (bowling)|strike]] and if a touchdown scored on a second-down play is a [[spare (bowling)|spare]], as in bowling. Graphics in the game were well-done and showed great representation. Other problems with the game were offensive or created or edited players in the game imported to ''[[Madden NFL 07]]'' were un-signable at a rating of \"99\" and contracted at a high amount of money which were over the game's salary cap. Also, draft classes had defensive players as listed as top five picks and very few offensive players were top five or top ten picks in the NFL Draft. \"Create-a-player\" required the player to insert the player's name and gear, but the player's look or appearance could not be changed after the player was created. Also unlike ''Madden 07'' players ratings and names could be edited.\n\n==Awards & Reception==\nThe [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version of the game is the most critically successful, receiving an 87.8% on GameRankings.\n\n===Awards===\n*Received [[IGN]]'s award for Best [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] Sports Game of 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bestof.ign.com/2006/ps2/16.html |title=IGN.com Presents: the best of 2006 |accessdate=2008-05-26 |publisher= |date= }}</ref>\n*Gaming Target - \"52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2006\" selection <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=6371 |title=52 Games we'll still be playing from 2006 |accessdate=2008-05-26 |publisher= |date= }}</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://sports.ign.com/articles/703/703531p1.html Reggie Bush Immortalized]\n*[http://sports.ign.com/articles/702/702461p1.html NCAA Football 360: First Look]\n\n{{NCAA Football games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ncaa Football 07}}\n[[Category:2006 video games]]\n[[Category:College football video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 2 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Portable games]]\n[[Category:Xbox games]]\n[[Category:Xbox 360 games]]\n[[Category:Electronic Arts games]]\n[[Category:EA Sports games]]\n[[Category:North America-exclusive video games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:NCAA video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=May 2012}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title=NCAA Football 07\n|image=NCAA Football 07 Coverart.jpg\n|developer=[[EA Tiburon]]\n|publisher=[[EA Sports]]\n|designer=\n|engine=\n|released=July 18, 2006\n|genre=[[Sports game|Sports]], [[American football]]\n|modes=[[single-player video game|Single player]], [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]], multiplayer online\n|platforms=[[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]\n}}\n\n'''''NCAA Football 07''''' is a [[college football|collegiate football]] [[video game]] published by [[Electronic Arts]]. It is the successor to ''[[NCAA Football 06]]'' in the ''[[NCAA Football series|NCAA Football]]'' series. The product features former [[University of Southern California|USC]] player [[Reggie Bush]] on the cover. While there weren't any new, major features added to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox games, tweaks were added to improve the existing features.\n\nThe theme for ''07'' is \"Turn the Tide\". Like [[NCAA Football 2005|the 2005 version]] said for home-field advantage, this year's version emphasizes that momentum is more important in college football than any other sport. This is illustrated by a momentum meter on the score graphic at the top (or bottom, in the case of the Xbox 360 version) of the screen. The more the meter is shifted towards a team, the better its players will perform (ex. If the momentum bar is all the way full with a +5 number below it (or above it), all players on the team will have their attributes boosted 5 points).\n\n''NCAA Football 07'' also includes spring drills, an update to Race for the Heisman mode called Campus Legend (which plays more like NFL Superstar mode in ''[[Madden NFL 07|Madden]]''), [[ESPN]] integration, and a spring game in Dynasty and Campus Legend modes. ESPN integration is expected to increase with the next NCAA Football releases.\n\n\n==Campus Legend==\n\nCampus Legend, for the most part, runs on the same system as its predecessor, Race for the Heisman. One creates a player, goes to a football camp, performs in drills, and is awarded a scholarship to play for a Division 1-A program. However, changes begin right from the start of camp. \n<sup>Campus Legend was not available on the Xbox 360 Version of the game.</sup>\n\n===Camp===\nRather than picking one drill to participate in, the player participates in a series of four drills which vary by position. (e.g. player gains attribute points - one to sixteen points depending on the performance - by repeatedly tapping A on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] during the 40 Yard Dash.)\n\n===Picking a school===\n\n[[Image:Ncaa 2007 screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Screenshot of in-game action between [[Virginia Tech]] and [[University of Virginia|Virginia]] at [[Lane Stadium]]]]\nAnother change in ''NCAA Football 07'' is which schools you can attend. Rather than choosing one of three scholarships or applying as a walk-on to another program, performance in camp determines your points and the distribution of those to your player will determine the caliber of your player (between one and five stars). This, in turn, determines how many of the 119 schools one can sign with and how highly those teams are ranked that you sign with. For example, a five-star recruit has the option to sign with any Division 1-A program of any rank and has a 50% popularity bonus, while a four-star recruit can sign with any Division 1-A program without the bonus. The lower the caliber, the fewer schools and lower rank one can choose from.\n\n===The Dorm===\nOnce moved into the dorm, a player is required to choose a major. While some are legitimate (e.g. chemistry, sports medicine, English), others are rather odd (e.g. [[ESPN]], 1-AA team nicknames, sports geography). Academic performance will improve a player's ratings, but one must choose a major that improves relevant ratings. For example, a quarterback would not want to major in something that would improve his tackling ability. In your dorm room, there is also a fan mailbox, where you can read generated mail from your fans. Also added is an NCAA progress report, where you can check your GPA, athletic goals, attribute point bonuses, and popularity; a computer to check rankings anywhere from the Heisman watch to All-Americans to the coaches' and AP polls; a closet to edit appearance, gear, and attribute points; and a school magazine chronicling headlines from your team (or, in case of a senior year, they will boast about the player).  The dorm room also featured a picture of the player's current girlfriend, with the beauty depending on the player's success; this feature was removed for the NCAA football 08 edition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/780/780221p1.html |title=NCAA Football 08 Preview |accessdate=2008-05-26 |publisher= |date= }}</ref>\n\n===During the year===\nCampus Legend introduces a challenge for the player to balance academic performance, athletic performance, and campus popularity in hopes of becoming the greatest to ever attend his school.

Crusade}}\n{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}\n}}\nThe '''Second Crusade''' (1147\u20131150) was the second major [[crusade]] launched from Europe. The Second Crusade was started in response to the [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|fall]] of the [[County of Edessa]] in 1144 to the forces of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]]. The county had been founded during the [[First Crusade]] (1096\u20131099) by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] in 1098. While it was the first [[Crusader state]] to be founded, it was also the first to fall.\n\nThe Second Crusade was announced by [[Pope Eugene III]], and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings, namely [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Conrad III of Germany]], with help from a number of other European nobles. The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe. After crossing [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory into [[Anatolia]], both armies were separately defeated by the [[Seljuk Turks]]. The main Western Christian source, [[Odo of Deuil]], and [[Syriac Christian]] sources claim that the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] secretly hindered the crusaders' progress, particularly in Anatolia, where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them. Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached [[Jerusalem]] and participated in 1148 in an ill-advised attack on [[Damascus]]. The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the [[Muslims]]. It would ultimately have a key influence on the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] and give rise to the [[Third Crusade]] at the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe only significant Christian success of the Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the [[Holy Land]], the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the [[Siege of Lisbon|capture of Lisbon]], expelling its [[Moorish]] occupants.\n\n== Background: the fall of Edessa ==\n{{main|Siege of Edessa (1144)}}\nAfter the [[First Crusade]] and the minor [[Crusade of 1101]], there were three [[crusader state]]s established in the east: the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the [[Principality of Antioch]] and the [[County of Edessa]]. A fourth, the [[County of Tripoli]], was established in 1109. Edessa was the most northerly of these, and also the weakest and least populated; as such, it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the [[Ortoqids]], [[Danishmends]] and [[Seljuq Turks]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=50\u201353}} Count [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] and future count [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]] were taken captive after their defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]] in 1104. Baldwin and Joscelin were both captured a second time in 1122, and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the [[Battle of Azaz (1125)|Battle of Azaz]] in 1125, Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131. His successor [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II]] was forced into an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but in 1143 both the [[list of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[John II Comnenus]] and the [[King of Jerusalem]] [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk of Anjou]] died. Joscelin had also quarreled with the Count of Tripoli and the Prince of Antioch, leaving Edessa with no powerful allies.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Seljuq [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]], had added to his rule in 1128 [[Aleppo]], the key to power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and [[Damascus]]. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their attention towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}} Damascus, ruled by the [[Burid Dynasty]], later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140;{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=227\u2013228}} the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler [[Usamah ibn Munqidh]].<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5440995n.image.r=Ous%C3%A2ma+ibn+Mounkidh.f203.langEN Ous\u00e2ma ibn Mounkidh, un \u00e9mir syrien au premier si\u00e8cle des croisades, p.182 (in BnF)]</ref>\n\nIn late 1144, Joscelin II allied with the Ortoqids and marched out of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] with almost his entire army to support the Ortoqid army against Aleppo. Zengi, already seeking to take advantage of Fulk's death in 1143, hurried north to [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|besiege Edessa]], which fell to him after a month on 24 December 1144. [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]] and others were sent from Jerusalem to assist, but arrived too late. Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county from [[Turbessel]], but little by little the rest of the territory was captured by Muslims or sold to the Byzantines. Zengi himself was praised throughout Islam as \"defender of the faith\" and ''al-Malik al-Mansur'', \"the victorious king\". He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa, or the Principality of Antioch, as was feared. Events in Mosul compelled him to return home, and he once again set his sights on Damascus. However, he was [[Assassination|assassinated]] by a slave in 1146 and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=225\u2013244}}\n\n=== ''Quantum praedecessores'' ===\n{{main|Quantum praedecessores}}\nThe news of the fall of Edessa was brought back to Europe first by pilgrims early in 1145, and then by embassies from Antioch, Jerusalem and Armenia. Bishop [[Hugh of Jabala]] reported the news to [[Pope Eugene III]], who issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Quantum praedecessores]]'' on 1 December of that year, calling for a second crusade.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=273\u2013275}} Hugh also told the Pope of an eastern Christian king, who, it was hoped, would bring relief to the crusader states: this is the first documented mention of [[Prester John]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=247}} Eugene did not control Rome and lived instead at [[Viterbo]],{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=289}} but nevertheless the Second Crusade was meant to be more organized and centrally controlled than the First: the armies would be led by the strongest kings of Europe and a route would be planned beforehand.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=298}}\n\nThe initial response to the new crusade bull was poor, and it in fact had to be reissued when it was clear that [[Louis VII of France]] would be taking part in the expedition. Louis VII had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope, which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145. It is debatable whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage, as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his dead brother Philip to go to the Holy Land. It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently of hearing about ''Quantum Praedecessores''. In any case, [[Abbot Suger]] and other nobles were not in favour of Louis's plans, as he would be gone from the kingdom for several years. Louis consulted [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who referred him back to Eugene. By now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull, and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis's crusade. The bull was reissued on 1 March 1146, and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\n== Saint Bernard of Clairvaux ==\n[[File:Stained glass St Bernard MNMA Cl3273.jpg|150px|thumb|left|St Bernard in stained glass, from the Upper Rhine, c. 1450|alt=Stained glass image of a kneeling man with a halo holding an open book and a staff]]\nThe Pope commissioned French abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] to preach the Second Crusade, and granted the same [[indulgence]]s for it which [[Pope Urban II]] had accorded to the [[First Crusade]].{{sfn|Bunson|1998|p=130}} A [[Council of V\u00e9zelay (1146)|parliament]] was convoked at [[Vezelay]] in Burgundy in 1146, and Bernard preached before the assembly on 31 March. [[Louis VII of France]], his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], and the princes and lords present prostrated themselves at the feet of Bernard to receive the pilgrims' cross. Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. At Speyer, [[Conrad III of Germany]] and his nephew, later Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], received the cross from the hand of Bernard.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} Pope Eugene came in person to France to encourage the enterprise.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\nFor all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was by nature neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching inadvertently led to attacks on [[Jews]]; a fanatical French monk named [[Radulphe|Rudolf]] was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the [[Rhineland]], [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Speyer]], with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. Bernard, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problem and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=281\u2013288}}\n\n== Wendish Crusade ==\n{{Main|Wendish Crusade}}\nWhen the Second Crusade was called, many [[Southern Germany|south Germans]] volunteered to crusade in the [[Holy Land]]. The [[Northern Germany|north German]] Saxons were reluctant. They told St Bernard of their desire to campaign against pagan Slavs at an [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] meeting in [[Frankfurt]] on 13 March 1147. Approving of the Saxons' plan, Eugenius issued a [[papal bull]] known as the ''Divina dispensatione'' on 13 April. This bull stated that there was to be no difference between the spiritual rewards of the different crusaders. Those who volunteered to crusade against the pagan Slavs were primarily [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Saxons]] and [[Poles]],{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=362}} although there were also some [[Bohemia]]ns.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=326}} The [[Papal legate]], [[Anselm of Havelberg]], was placed in overall command. The campaign itself was led by Saxon families such as the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] and [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Schauenburgers]].{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=328}}\n\nUpset by German participation in the crusade, the [[Obotrites]] preemptively invaded [[Wagria]] in [[Holstein]] in June 1147, leading to the march of the crusaders in late summer 1147. After expelling the Obodrites from Christian territory, the crusaders targeted the Obodrite fort at [[Dobin am See|Dobin]] and the [[Liutizian]] fort at [[Demmin]]. The forces attacking Dobin included those of the Danes [[Canute V of Denmark|Canute V]] and [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Sweyn III]], Adalbert II, [[Archbishop of Bremen]] and Duke [[Henry the Lion]] of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. When some crusaders advocated ravaging the countryside, others objected by asking, \"Is not the land we are devastating our land, and the people we are fighting our people?\"{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=55}} The Saxon army under Henry the Lion withdrew after the pagan chief, [[Niklot]], agreed to have Dobin's garrison undergo [[baptism]].\n\nAfter an unsuccessful siege of Demmin, a contingent of crusaders was diverted by the margraves to attack [[Pomerania]] instead. They reached the already Christian city [[Szczecin|Stettin]], whereupon the crusaders dispersed after meeting with Bishop [[Adalbert of Pomerania]] and Prince [[Ratibor I of Pomerania]]. According to Bernard of Clairvaux, the goal of the crusade was to battle the pagan Slavs \"until such a time as, by God's help, they shall either be converted or deleted\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=53}}\n\nHowever, the crusade failed to achieve the conversion of most of the Wends. The Saxons achieved largely token conversions at Dobin, as the Slavs resorted to their pagan beliefs once the Christian armies dispersed. Albert of Pomerania explained, \"If they had come to strengthen the Christian faith ... they should do so by preaching, not by arms\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=54}}\n\nBy the end of the crusade, the countryside of [[Mecklenburg]] and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion.{{sfn|Barraclough|1984|p=263}} This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production, limiting their resistance in the future.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=327}}\n\n== Reconquista and the fall of Lisbon ==\n{{main|Siege of Lisbon|Siege of Tortosa (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg|thumb|''The Siege of Lisbon by D. Afonso Henriques'' by Joaquim Rodrigues Braga (1840)|alt=Painting of a group of men clustered around a seated man in armor wearing a crown. Kneeling before the seated man is another man, with a third man standing between the two men and pointing at the kneeling man.]]\nIn the spring of 1147, the Pope authorized the expansion of the crusade into the [[Iberian peninsula]], in the context of the [[Reconquista]]. He also authorized [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] to equate his campaigns against the [[Moors]] with the rest of the Second Crusade.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] in England for the [[Holy Land]]. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast, at the northern city of [[Porto]] on 16 June 1147. There they were convinced to meet with [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King]] [[Afonso I of Portugal]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}}\n\nThe crusaders agreed to help the King attack [[Lisbon]], with a solemn agreement that offered to them the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The [[Siege of Lisbon]] lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, but some of them set sail and continued to the Holy Land.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}} Some of them, who had departed earlier, helped [[Conquest of Santar\u00e9m|capture Santar\u00e9m]] earlier in the same year. Later they also helped to conquer [[Sintra]], [[Almada]], [[Palmela]] and [[Set\u00fabal]], and they were allowed to stay in the conquered lands, where they settled down and had offspring.\n\nElsewhere on the Iberian peninsula, almost at the same time, King [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]], Count [[Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona]], and others led a mixed army of [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]], Leonese, Castilians and [[France in the Middle Ages|French]] crusaders against the rich port city of [[Almer\u00eda]]. With support from a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]\u2013[[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] navy, the city was occupied in October 1147.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}}\n\nRamon Berenger then invaded the lands of the [[Almoravid]] [[taifa]] kingdom of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Murcia]]. In December 1148, he [[Siege of Tortosa (1148)|captured Tortosa]] after a five-month siege again with the help of French, [[Anglo-Normans]] and Genoese crusaders.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} The next year, [[Fraga]], [[Lleida]] and [[Mequinenza]] in the confluence of the [[Segre River|Segre]] and [[Ebro]] rivers fell to his army.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=126}}\n\n== Forces ==\n\n=== Islamic ===\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|The Near East in 1135. Crusader states are marked with a red cross.|thumb|right]]\nThe professional soldiers of the Muslim states, who were usually ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]], tended to be very well-trained and equipped. The basis of the military system in the Islamic Middle East was the ''[[iqta']]'' system of fiefs, which supported a certain number of troops in every district. In the event of war, the ''[[ahdath]]'' militias, based in the cities under the command of the ''ra\u2019is'' (chief), and who were usually ethnic [[Arab]]s, were called upon to increase the number of troops. The ''ahdath'' militia, though less well trained than the Turkish professional troops, were often very strongly motivated by religion, especially the concept of ''[[jihad]]''. Further support came from [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] and [[Kurd]]ish auxiliaries, who could be called upon in times of war, though these forces were prone to indiscipline.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 28\u201330}}\n\nThe principal Islamic commander was [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur|Mu'in al-Din Anur]], the ''atabeg'' of Damascus from 1138 to 1149. Damascus was supposedly ruled by the [[Burid amirs]] of Damascus, but Anur, who commanded the military, was the real ruler of the city. The historian David Nicolle described Anur as an able general and diplomat, also well known as a patron of the arts. Because the Burid dynasty was displaced in 1154 by the Zangid dynasty, Anur's role in repulsing the Second Crusade has been largely erased with historians and chroniclers loyal to the Zangids giving the credit to Anur's rival, Nur ad-Din Zangi, the amir of Aleppo.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 19\u201321}}\n\n=== Crusaders ===\nThe German contingent comprised about 20,000 knights; the French contingent had about 700 knights from the king's lands while the nobility raised smaller numbers of knights; and the Kingdom of Jerusalem had about 950 knights and 6,000 infantrymen.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 24}}\n\nThe French knights preferred to fight on horseback, while the German knights liked to fight on foot. The [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] chronicler [[John Kinnamos]] wrote \"the French are particularly capable of riding horseback in good order and attacking with the spear, and their cavalry surpasses that of the Germans in speed. The Germans, however, are able to fight on foot better than the French and excel in using the great sword\".{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 26\u201327}}\n\nConrad III was considered to be a brave knight, though often described as indecisive in moments of crisis.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 17}} Louis VII was a devout Christian with a sensitive side who was often attacked by contemporaries like Bernard of Clairvaux for being more in love with his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], than being interested in war or politics.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 18}}\n\n== Crusade in the East ==\n[[File:Deuxi\u00e8me croisade.JPG|thumb|Map of Second Crusade]]\n\nJoscelin II tried to re-take Edessa following Zengi's murder, but Nur ad-Din defeated him in November 1146. On 16 February 1147, the French crusaders met at [[\u00c9tampes]] to discuss their route. The Germans had already decided to travel overland through Hungary; they regarded the sea route as politically impractical because [[Roger II of Sicily]] was an enemy of Conrad. Many of the French nobles distrusted the land route, which would take them through the [[Byzantine Empire]], the reputation of which still suffered from the accounts of the [[First Crusade]]rs. Nevertheless, the French decided to follow Conrad, and to set out on 15 June. Roger II took offence and refused to participate any longer. In France, [[Abbot Suger]] was elected by a great council at [[\u00c9tampes]] (and appointed by the Pope) to act as one of the regents during the king's absence on crusade. In Germany, further preaching was done by [[Adam of Ebrach]], and [[Otto of Freising]] also took the cross. The Germans planned to set out at [[Easter]], but did not leave until May.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 257, 259}}\n\n=== German route ===\nThe German crusaders, accompanied by the [[papal legate]] and [[cardinal (religion)|cardinal]] [[Theodwin of Santa Rufina|Theodwin]], intended to meet the French in [[Constantinople]]. [[Ottokar III of Styria]] joined Conrad at [[Vienna]], and Conrad's enemy [[G\u00e9za II of Hungary]] allowed them to pass through unharmed. When the German army of 20,000 men arrived in Byzantine territory, Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] feared they were going to attack him, and had Byzantine troops posted to ensure against trouble. A brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans occurred near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] and in [[Adrianople]], where the Byzantine general Prosouch fought with Conrad's nephew, the future emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]]. To make matters worse, some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September. On 10 September, however, they arrived at Constantinople, where relations with Manuel were poor, resulting in a [[Battle of Constantinople (1147)|battle]], after which the Germans became convinced that they should cross into [[Asia Minor]] as quickly as possible.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 42}} Manuel wanted Conrad to leave some of his troops behind, to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II, who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of Greece, but Conrad did not agree, despite being a fellow enemy of Roger.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 259\u2013267}}\n\nIn Asia Minor, Conrad decided not to wait for the French, but marched towards [[Iconium]], capital of the [[Seljuq Turks|Seljuq]] [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]]. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much of the authority of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 43}} Conrad underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} The Seljuqs almost totally destroyed King Conrad's party on 25 October 1147 at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1147)|second battle of Dorylaeum]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}\n\nIn battle, the Turks used their typical tactic of pretending to retreat, and then returning to attack the small force of German cavalry which had separated from the main army to chase them. Conrad began a slow retreat back to Constantinople, his army harassed daily by the Turks, who attacked stragglers and defeated the rearguard.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 47}} Conrad himself was wounded in a skirmish with them. The other division of the German force, led by the King's half-brother, Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], had marched south to the Mediterranean coast and was similarly defeated early in 1148.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 267\u2013270}} The force led by Otto ran out of food while crossing inhospitable countryside and was ambushed by the Seljuq Turks near Laodicea on 16 November 1147. The majority of Otto's force were either killed in battle or captured and sold into slavery.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}}\n\n=== French route ===\n[[File:C croisade2 Louis7.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis VII of France]]\nThe French crusaders had departed from [[Metz]] in June 1147, led by Louis, [[Thierry, Count of Flanders|Thierry of Alsace]], [[Renaut I of Bar]], [[Amadeus III of Savoy]] and his half-brother [[William V of Montferrat]], William VII of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and others, along with armies from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Brittany]], [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Aquitaine]]. A force from [[Provence]], led by Alphonse of Toulouse, chose to wait until August, and to cross by sea. At [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Louis joined with crusaders from [[Normandy]] and England. They followed Conrad's route fairly peacefully, although Louis came into conflict with king G\u00e9za of [[Hungary]] when G\u00e9za discovered that Louis had allowed a failed Hungarian usurper, [[Boris Kalamanos]], to join his army. Relations within Byzantine territory were also grim, and the Lorrainers, who had marched ahead of the rest of the French, also came into conflict with the slower Germans whom they met on the way.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=259\u2013263}}\n\nSince the original negotiations between Louis and Manuel I, Manuel had broken off his military campaign against R\u00fbm, signing a truce with his enemy Sultan [[Mesud I]]. Manuel did this to give himself a free hand to concentrate on defending his empire from the Crusaders, who had gained a reputation for theft and treachery since the [[First Crusade]] and were widely suspected of harbouring sinister designs on [[Constantinople]]. Nevertheless, Manuel's relations with the French army were somewhat better than with the Germans, and Louis was entertained lavishly in Constantinople. Some of the French were outraged by Manuel's truce with the Seljuqs and called for an alliance with Roger II and an attack on Constantinople, but Louis restrained them.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\n[[File:Manuelcomnenus.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Manuel I|alt= A standing male, dressed in elaborate robes with a fancy hat. He has a halo around his head and is holding a long staff in one hand.]]\n\nWhen the armies from Savoy, [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] and [[Montferrat]] joined Louis in Constantinople, having taken the land route through Italy and crossing from [[Brindisi]] to [[Durazzo]], the entire army took ship across the [[Bosporus]] to [[Asia Minor]]. The Greeks were encouraged by rumours that the Germans had captured [[Iconium]] (Konya), but Manuel refused to give Louis any Byzantine troops. [[Roger II of Sicily]] had just invaded Byzantine territory, and Manuel needed all his army in the [[Peloponnese]]. Both the Germans and French therefore entered Asia without any Byzantine assistance, unlike the armies of the First Crusade. Following the example set by his grandfather [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]], Manuel had the French swear to return to the Empire any territory they captured.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p= 269}}\n\nThe French met the remnants of Conrad's army at [[Lopadion]], and Conrad joined Louis's force. They followed Otto of Freising's route, moving closer to the Mediterranean coast, and arrived at [[Ephesus]] in December, where they learned that the Turks were preparing to attack them. Manuel also sent ambassadors complaining about the pillaging and plundering that Louis had done along the way, and there was no guarantee that the Byzantines would assist them against the Turks. Meanwhile, Conrad fell sick and returned to Constantinople, where Manuel attended to him personally, and Louis, paying no attention to the warnings of a Turkish attack, marched out from Ephesus with the French and German survivors. The Turks were indeed waiting to attack, but in a [[Battle of Ephesus (1147)|small battle]] outside Ephesus on 24 December 1147, the French proved victorious.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 270\u2013271}} The French fended off [[Battle of the Meander|another Turkish ambush]] at the Meander River in the same month.\n\nThey reached [[Laodicea on the Lycus]] early in January 1148, just after Otto of Freising's army had been destroyed in the same area.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=51}} Resuming the march, the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated from the rest of the army [[Battle of Mount Cadmus|at Mount Cadmus]], where Louis's troops suffered heavy losses from the Turks (6 January 1148). Louis himself, according to [[Odo of Deuil]], climbed a rock and was ignored by the Turks, who did not recognize him. The Turks did not bother to attack further and the French marched on to [[Antalya|Adalia]], continually harassed from afar by the Turks, who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food, both for themselves and their horses. Louis no longer wanted to continue by land, and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and to sail for Antioch.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} After being delayed for a month by storms, most of the promised ships did not arrive at all. Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves, while the rest of the army had to resume the long march to Antioch. The army was almost entirely destroyed, either by the Turks or by sickness.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 272\u2013273}}\n\n=== Journey to Jerusalem ===\n[[File:RaymondOfPoitiersWelcomingLouisVIIinAntioch.JPG|thumb|Raymond of Poitiers welcoming Louis VII in Antioch|alt= Painting of two men meeting in front of a city gate. Both men are in front of crowds of other people. The one on the left is bareheaded and holds his hat in one hand while he bows to the other figure, who is dressed in blue embroidered robes and wears a crown.]]\nThough delayed by storms, Louis eventually arrived in Antioch on 19 March; Amadeus of Savoy had died on [[Cyprus]] along the way. Louis was welcomed by Eleanor's uncle [[Raymond of Poitiers]]. Raymond expected him to help defend against the Turks and to accompany him on an expedition against Aleppo, the Muslim city that functioned as the gateway to Edessa, but Louis refused, preferring instead to finish his pilgrimage to Jerusalem rather than focus on the military aspect of the crusade.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} Eleanor enjoyed her stay, but her uncle implored her to remain to enlarge family lands and divorce Louis if the king refused to help what was assuredly the military cause of the Crusade.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 54}} During this period, there were rumours of an affair between Raymond and Eleanor, which caused tensions in the marriage between Louis and Eleanor.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 18, 54}} Louis quickly left Antioch for [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]] with Eleanor under arrest. Meanwhile, [[Otto of Freising]] and the remnant of his troops arrived in Jerusalem early in April, and Conrad soon after.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|pp= 49\u201350}} [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk]], the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], was sent to invite Louis to join them. The fleet that had stopped at Lisbon arrived around this time, as well as the Proven\u00e7als who had left Europe under the command of [[Alfonso Jordan]], [[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]]. Alfonso himself did not reach Jerusalem; he died at [[Caesarea]], supposedly poisoned by [[Raymond II of Tripoli]], the nephew who feared his political aspirations in the county. The claim that Raymond had poisoned Alfonso caused much of the Proven\u00e7al force to turn back and return home.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 54}} The original focus of the crusade was [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], but the preferred target of [[King Baldwin III]] and of the [[Knights Templar]] was [[Damascus]].{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp=115\u2013121}}\n\nIn response to the arrival of the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted. Unur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus. It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Unur might lose his city to the Crusaders.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 55}}\n\n=== Council of Palmarea ===\n{{main|Council of Acre}}\nThe nobility of Jerusalem welcomed the arrival of troops from Europe. A council to decide on the best target for the crusaders took place on 24 June 1148, when the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem]] met with the recently arrived crusaders from Europe at Palmarea, near [[Akko|Acre]], a major city of the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. This was the most spectacular meeting of the Court in its existence.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}{{sfn|William of Tyre|Babcock|Krey|1943|loc= vol. 2, bk. 17, ch. 1, pp. 184\u2013185: \"it seems well worth while and quite in harmony with the present history that the names of the nobles who were present at the council... should be recorded here for the benefit of posterity&nbsp;... to name each one individually would take far too long.\"}}\n\nIn the end, the decision was made to attack the city of Damascus, a former ally of the Kingdom of Jerusalem that had shifted its allegiance to that of the Zengids, and attacked the Kingdom's allied city of [[Battle of Bosra (1147)|Bosra]] in 1147.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 54\u201355}} Historians have long seen the decision to besiege Damascus rather than Edessa as \"an act of inexplicable folly\". Noting the tensions between Unur, the ''atabeg'' of Damascus, and the growing power of the Zangids, many historians have argued that it would have been better for the Crusaders to focus their energy against the Zangids. More recently, historians such as David Nicolle have defended the decision to attack Damascus, arguing that Damascus was the most powerful Muslim state in southern Syria, and that if the Christians held Damascus, they would have been in a better position to resist the rising power of [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]]. Since Unur was clearly the weaker of the two Muslim rulers, it was believed that it was inevitable that Nur ad-Din would take Damascus sometime in the near future, and thus it seemed better for the Crusaders to hold that city rather than the Zangids.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 37\u201338}} In July their armies assembled at [[Tiberias]] and marched to Damascus, around the [[Sea of Galilee]] by way of [[Banyas]]. There were perhaps 50,000 troops in total.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=228\u2013229}}\n\n=== Siege of Damascus ===\n{{main|Siege of Damascus (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Damascus.jpg|thumb|Siege of Damascus]]\nThe crusaders decided to attack Damascus from the west, where [[orchard]]s would provide them with a constant food supply.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July. The following day, the Muslims were prepared for the attack and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus. The defenders had sought help from [[Saif ad-Din Ghazi I]] of [[Mosul]] and Nur ad-Din of [[Aleppo]], who personally led an attack on the crusader camp. The crusaders were pushed back from the walls into the orchards, leaving them exposed to ambushes and guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Tyre]], on 27 July the crusaders decided to move to the plain on the eastern side of the city, which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible for the Crusaders to return to their better position.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July, though for their entire retreat they were followed by [[Seljuqids|Turkish]] archers who constantly harassed them.{{sfn|Baldwin|Setton|1969|p= 510}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|left|266px|The Mediterranean world after the Second Crusade in 1173|alt=Map showing the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. Along the west and southwest coasts is the Muwahid Caliphate. The Zangid Sultanate covers most of the southeast coast and the inland areas from the east coast, which is occupied by the Crusader States. The Byzantine Empire covers most of the northeast coast and inland areas. The center of the north coast is held by the Holy Roman Empire and the northwest coast is held by the kingdoms of France and Aragon.]]\n\nEach of the Christian forces felt betrayed by the other.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}} A new plan was made to attack [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, due to the lack of trust that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 77}}\n\nBack in Europe, [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard considered it his duty to send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his ''Book of Consideration''. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}} He would die in 1153.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}}\n\nThe cultural impact of the Second Crusade was even greater in France, with many [[troubadour]]s fascinated by the alleged affair between Eleanor and Raymond, which helped to feed the theme of courtly love. Unlike Conrad, the image of Louis was improved by the Crusade with many of the French seeing him as a suffering pilgrim king who quietly bore God's punishments.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81\u201384}}\n\n[[File:Saladin's Conquest (1174-1189).jpg|thumb|right|320px|Map of [[Saladin]]'s Conquest into [[the Levant]]]]\n\nRelations between the Eastern Roman Empire and the French were badly damaged by the Crusade. Louis and other French leaders openly accused the Emperor Manuel I of colluding with Turkish attacks on them during the march across Asia Minor. The memory of the Second Crusade was to color French views of the Byzantines for the rest of the 12th and 13th centuries. Within the empire itself, the crusade was remembered as a triumph of diplomacy.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}} In the eulogy for the Emperor Manuel by Archbishop [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], it was declared:\n\n<blockquote>He was able to deal with his enemies with enviable skill, playing off one against the other with the aim of bringing peace and tranquility{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}}</blockquote>\n\nThe preliminary Wendish Crusade achieved mixed results. While the Saxons affirmed their possession of Wagria and Polabia, pagans retained control of the Obodrite land east of L\u00fcbeck. The Saxons also received tribute from Chief Niklot, enabled the colonization of the [[Bishopric of Havelberg]], and freed some [[Danes|Danish]] prisoners. However, the disparate Christian leaders regarded their counterparts with suspicion and accused each other of sabotaging the campaign. In Iberia, the campaigns in Spain, along with the siege of Lisbon, were some of the few lasting Christian victories of the Second Crusade. They are seen as pivotal battles of the wider Reconquista, which would be completed in 1492.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=126}}\n\nIn the East the situation was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem. In 1149, the ''atabeg'' Anur died, at which point the amir Abu Sa'id Mujir al-Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule. The ''ra'is'' of Damascus and commander of the ''ahdath'' military Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ''ahdath'' had played a major role in defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved a greater share of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}} The in-fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81}} Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}}\n\nBaldwin III finally [[Siege of Ascalon|seized Ascalon]] in 1153, which brought [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] into the sphere of conflict. Jerusalem was able to make further advances into Egypt, briefly occupying [[Cairo]] in the 1160s.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=56}} However, relations with the Byzantine Empire were mixed, and reinforcements from Europe were sparse after the disaster of the Second Crusade. King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] allied with the Byzantines and participated in a combined invasion of Egypt in 1169, but the expedition ultimately failed. In 1171, [[Saladin]], nephew of one of Nur ad-Din's generals, was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt, uniting [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and completely surrounding the crusader kingdom. Meanwhile, the Byzantine alliance ended with the death of emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel I]] in 1180, and in 1187, [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Jerusalem capitulated]] to Saladin. His forces then spread north to capture all but the capital cities of the Crusader States, precipitating the [[Third Crusade]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=60}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{cite book|author=Bunson, Matthew, Margaret, & Stephen|title=Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints| publisher = Our Sunday Visitor| location = Huntington|year=1998| isbn = 978-0-87973-588-3 |ref=CITEREFBunson1998 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Baldwin | first = Mrshall W. |last2=Setton  |first2=Kenneth M. | title =A History of the Crusades, Volume I: The First Hundred Years | location = Madison, Wisconsin | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1969 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Barraclough | first = Geoffrey |author-link=Geoffrey Barraclough | title = The Origins of Modern Germany | year = 1984 | publisher = W.

Crusade}}\n{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}\n}}\nThe '''Second Crusade''' (1147\u20131150) was the second major [[crusade]] launched from Europe. The Second Crusade was started in response to the [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|fall]] of the [[County of Edessa]] in 1144 to the forces of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]]. The county had been founded during the [[First Crusade]] (1096\u20131099) by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] in 1098. While it was the first [[Crusader state]] to be founded, it was also the first to fall.\n\nThe Second Crusade was announced by [[Pope Eugene III]], and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings, namely [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Conrad III of Germany]], with help from a number of other European nobles. The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe. After crossing [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory into [[Anatolia]], both armies were separately defeated by the [[Seljuk Turks]]. The main Western Christian source, [[Odo of Deuil]], and [[Syriac Christian]] sources claim that the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] secretly hindered the crusaders' progress, particularly in Anatolia, where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them. Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached [[Jerusalem]] and participated in 1148 in an ill-advised attack on [[Damascus]]. The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the [[Muslims]]. It would ultimately have a key influence on the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] and give rise to the [[Third Crusade]] at the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe only significant Christian success of the Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the [[Holy Land]], the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the [[Siege of Lisbon|capture of Lisbon]], expelling its [[Moorish]] occupants.\n\n== Background: the fall of Edessa ==\n{{main|Siege of Edessa (1144)}}\nAfter the [[First Crusade]] and the minor [[Crusade of 1101]], there were three [[crusader state]]s established in the east: the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the [[Principality of Antioch]] and the [[County of Edessa]]. A fourth, the [[County of Tripoli]], was established in 1109. Edessa was the most northerly of these, and also the weakest and least populated; as such, it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the [[Ortoqids]], [[Danishmends]] and [[Seljuq Turks]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=50\u201353}} Count [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] and future count [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]] were taken captive after their defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]] in 1104. Baldwin and Joscelin were both captured a second time in 1122, and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the [[Battle of Azaz (1125)|Battle of Azaz]] in 1125, Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131. His successor [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II]] was forced into an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but in 1143 both the [[list of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[John II Comnenus]] and the [[King of Jerusalem]] [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk of Anjou]] died. Joscelin had also quarreled with the Count of Tripoli and the Prince of Antioch, leaving Edessa with no powerful allies.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Seljuq [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]], had added to his rule in 1128 [[Aleppo]], the key to power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and [[Damascus]]. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their attention towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}} Damascus, ruled by the [[Burid Dynasty]], later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140;{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=227\u2013228}} the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler [[Usamah ibn Munqidh]].<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5440995n.image.r=Ous%C3%A2ma+ibn+Mounkidh.f203.langEN Ous\u00e2ma ibn Mounkidh, un \u00e9mir syrien au premier si\u00e8cle des croisades, p.182 (in BnF)]</ref>\n\nIn late 1144, Joscelin II allied with the Ortoqids and marched out of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] with almost his entire army to support the Ortoqid army against Aleppo. Zengi, already seeking to take advantage of Fulk's death in 1143, hurried north to [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|besiege Edessa]], which fell to him after a month on 24 December 1144. [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]] and others were sent from Jerusalem to assist, but arrived too late. Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county from [[Turbessel]], but little by little the rest of the territory was captured by Muslims or sold to the Byzantines. Zengi himself was praised throughout Islam as \"defender of the faith\" and ''al-Malik al-Mansur'', \"the victorious king\". He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa, or the Principality of Antioch, as was feared. Events in Mosul compelled him to return home, and he once again set his sights on Damascus. However, he was [[Assassination|assassinated]] by a slave in 1146 and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=225\u2013244}}\n\n=== ''Quantum praedecessores'' ===\n{{main|Quantum praedecessores}}\nThe news of the fall of Edessa was brought back to Europe first by pilgrims early in 1145, and then by embassies from Antioch, Jerusalem and Armenia. Bishop [[Hugh of Jabala]] reported the news to [[Pope Eugene III]], who issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Quantum praedecessores]]'' on 1 December of that year, calling for a second crusade.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=273\u2013275}} Hugh also told the Pope of an eastern Christian king, who, it was hoped, would bring relief to the crusader states: this is the first documented mention of [[Prester John]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=247}} Eugene did not control Rome and lived instead at [[Viterbo]],{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=289}} but nevertheless the Second Crusade was meant to be more organized and centrally controlled than the First: the armies would be led by the strongest kings of Europe and a route would be planned beforehand.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=298}}\n\nThe initial response to the new crusade bull was poor, and it in fact had to be reissued when it was clear that [[Louis VII of France]] would be taking part in the expedition. Louis VII had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope, which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145. It is debatable whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage, as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his dead brother Philip to go to the Holy Land. It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently of hearing about ''Quantum Praedecessores''. In any case, [[Abbot Suger]] and other nobles were not in favour of Louis's plans, as he would be gone from the kingdom for several years. Louis consulted [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who referred him back to Eugene. By now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull, and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis's crusade. The bull was reissued on 1 March 1146, and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\n== Saint Bernard of Clairvaux ==\n[[File:Stained glass St Bernard MNMA Cl3273.jpg|150px|thumb|left|St Bernard in stained glass, from the Upper Rhine, c. 1450|alt=Stained glass image of a kneeling man with a halo holding an open book and a staff]]\nThe Pope commissioned French abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] to preach the Second Crusade, and granted the same [[indulgence]]s for it which [[Pope Urban II]] had accorded to the [[First Crusade]].{{sfn|Bunson|1998|p=130}} A [[Council of V\u00e9zelay (1146)|parliament]] was convoked at [[Vezelay]] in Burgundy in 1146, and Bernard preached before the assembly on 31 March. [[Louis VII of France]], his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], and the princes and lords present prostrated themselves at the feet of Bernard to receive the pilgrims' cross. Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. At Speyer, [[Conrad III of Germany]] and his nephew, later Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], received the cross from the hand of Bernard.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} Pope Eugene came in person to France to encourage the enterprise.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\nFor all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was by nature neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching inadvertently led to attacks on [[Jews]]; a fanatical French monk named [[Radulphe|Rudolf]] was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the [[Rhineland]], [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Speyer]], with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. Bernard, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problem and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=281\u2013288}}\n\n== Wendish Crusade ==\n{{Main|Wendish Crusade}}\nWhen the Second Crusade was called, many [[Southern Germany|south Germans]] volunteered to crusade in the [[Holy Land]]. The [[Northern Germany|north German]] Saxons were reluctant. They told St Bernard of their desire to campaign against pagan Slavs at an [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] meeting in [[Frankfurt]] on 13 March 1147. Approving of the Saxons' plan, Eugenius issued a [[papal bull]] known as the ''Divina dispensatione'' on 13 April. This bull stated that there was to be no difference between the spiritual rewards of the different crusaders. Those who volunteered to crusade against the pagan Slavs were primarily [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Saxons]] and [[Poles]],{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=362}} although there were also some [[Bohemia]]ns.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=326}} The [[Papal legate]], [[Anselm of Havelberg]], was placed in overall command. The campaign itself was led by Saxon families such as the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] and [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Schauenburgers]].{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=328}}\n\nUpset by German participation in the crusade, the [[Obotrites]] preemptively invaded [[Wagria]] in [[Holstein]] in June 1147, leading to the march of the crusaders in late summer 1147. After expelling the Obodrites from Christian territory, the crusaders targeted the Obodrite fort at [[Dobin am See|Dobin]] and the [[Liutizian]] fort at [[Demmin]]. The forces attacking Dobin included those of the Danes [[Canute V of Denmark|Canute V]] and [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Sweyn III]], Adalbert II, [[Archbishop of Bremen]] and Duke [[Henry the Lion]] of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. When some crusaders advocated ravaging the countryside, others objected by asking, \"Is not the land we are devastating our land, and the people we are fighting our people?\"{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=55}} The Saxon army under Henry the Lion withdrew after the pagan chief, [[Niklot]], agreed to have Dobin's garrison undergo [[baptism]].\n\nAfter an unsuccessful siege of Demmin, a contingent of crusaders was diverted by the margraves to attack [[Pomerania]] instead. They reached the already Christian city [[Szczecin|Stettin]], whereupon the crusaders dispersed after meeting with Bishop [[Adalbert of Pomerania]] and Prince [[Ratibor I of Pomerania]]. According to Bernard of Clairvaux, the goal of the crusade was to battle the pagan Slavs \"until such a time as, by God's help, they shall either be converted or deleted\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=53}}\n\nHowever, the crusade failed to achieve the conversion of most of the Wends. The Saxons achieved largely token conversions at Dobin, as the Slavs resorted to their pagan beliefs once the Christian armies dispersed. Albert of Pomerania explained, \"If they had come to strengthen the Christian faith ... they should do so by preaching, not by arms\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=54}}\n\nBy the end of the crusade, the countryside of [[Mecklenburg]] and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion.{{sfn|Barraclough|1984|p=263}} This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production, limiting their resistance in the future.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=327}}\n\n== Reconquista and the fall of Lisbon ==\n{{main|Siege of Lisbon|Siege of Tortosa (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg|thumb|''The Siege of Lisbon by D. Afonso Henriques'' by Joaquim Rodrigues Braga (1840)|alt=Painting of a group of men clustered around a seated man in armor wearing a crown. Kneeling before the seated man is another man, with a third man standing between the two men and pointing at the kneeling man.]]\nIn the spring of 1147, the Pope authorized the expansion of the crusade into the [[Iberian peninsula]], in the context of the [[Reconquista]]. He also authorized [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] to equate his campaigns against the [[Moors]] with the rest of the Second Crusade.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] in England for the [[Holy Land]]. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast, at the northern city of [[Porto]] on 16 June 1147. There they were convinced to meet with [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King]] [[Afonso I of Portugal]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}}\n\nThe crusaders agreed to help the King attack [[Lisbon]], with a solemn agreement that offered to them the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The [[Siege of Lisbon]] lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, but some of them set sail and continued to the Holy Land.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}} Some of them, who had departed earlier, helped [[Conquest of Santar\u00e9m|capture Santar\u00e9m]] earlier in the same year. Later they also helped to conquer [[Sintra]], [[Almada]], [[Palmela]] and [[Set\u00fabal]], and they were allowed to stay in the conquered lands, where they settled down and had offspring.\n\nElsewhere on the Iberian peninsula, almost at the same time, King [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]], Count [[Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona]], and others led a mixed army of [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]], Leonese, Castilians and [[France in the Middle Ages|French]] crusaders against the rich port city of [[Almer\u00eda]]. With support from a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]\u2013[[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] navy, the city was occupied in October 1147.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}}\n\nRamon Berenger then invaded the lands of the [[Almoravid]] [[taifa]] kingdom of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Murcia]]. In December 1148, he [[Siege of Tortosa (1148)|captured Tortosa]] after a five-month siege again with the help of French, [[Anglo-Normans]] and Genoese crusaders.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} The next year, [[Fraga]], [[Lleida]] and [[Mequinenza]] in the confluence of the [[Segre River|Segre]] and [[Ebro]] rivers fell to his army.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=126}}\n\n== Forces ==\n\n=== Islamic ===\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|The Near East in 1135. Crusader states are marked with a red cross.|thumb|right]]\nThe professional soldiers of the Muslim states, who were usually ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]], tended to be very well-trained and equipped. The basis of the military system in the Islamic Middle East was the ''[[iqta']]'' system of fiefs, which supported a certain number of troops in every district. In the event of war, the ''[[ahdath]]'' militias, based in the cities under the command of the ''ra\u2019is'' (chief), and who were usually ethnic [[Arab]]s, were called upon to increase the number of troops. The ''ahdath'' militia, though less well trained than the Turkish professional troops, were often very strongly motivated by religion, especially the concept of ''[[jihad]]''. Further support came from [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] and [[Kurd]]ish auxiliaries, who could be called upon in times of war, though these forces were prone to indiscipline.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 28\u201330}}\n\nThe principal Islamic commander was [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur|Mu'in al-Din Anur]], the ''atabeg'' of Damascus from 1138 to 1149. Damascus was supposedly ruled by the [[Burid amirs]] of Damascus, but Anur, who commanded the military, was the real ruler of the city. The historian David Nicolle described Anur as an able general and diplomat, also well known as a patron of the arts. Because the Burid dynasty was displaced in 1154 by the Zangid dynasty, Anur's role in repulsing the Second Crusade has been largely erased with historians and chroniclers loyal to the Zangids giving the credit to Anur's rival, Nur ad-Din Zangi, the amir of Aleppo.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 19\u201321}}\n\n=== Crusaders ===\nThe German contingent comprised about 20,000 knights; the French contingent had about 700 knights from the king's lands while the nobility raised smaller numbers of knights; and the Kingdom of Jerusalem had about 950 knights and 6,000 infantrymen.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 24}}\n\nThe French knights preferred to fight on horseback, while the German knights liked to fight on foot. The [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] chronicler [[John Kinnamos]] wrote \"the French are particularly capable of riding horseback in good order and attacking with the spear, and their cavalry surpasses that of the Germans in speed. The Germans, however, are able to fight on foot better than the French and excel in using the great sword\".{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 26\u201327}}\n\nConrad III was considered to be a brave knight, though often described as indecisive in moments of crisis.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 17}} Louis VII was a devout Christian with a sensitive side who was often attacked by contemporaries like Bernard of Clairvaux for being more in love with his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], than being interested in war or politics.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 18}}\n\n== Crusade in the East ==\n[[File:Deuxi\u00e8me croisade.JPG|thumb|Map of Second Crusade]]\n\nJoscelin II tried to re-take Edessa following Zengi's murder, but Nur ad-Din defeated him in November 1146. On 16 February 1147, the French crusaders met at [[\u00c9tampes]] to discuss their route. The Germans had already decided to travel overland through Hungary; they regarded the sea route as politically impractical because [[Roger II of Sicily]] was an enemy of Conrad. Many of the French nobles distrusted the land route, which would take them through the [[Byzantine Empire]], the reputation of which still suffered from the accounts of the [[First Crusade]]rs. Nevertheless, the French decided to follow Conrad, and to set out on 15 June. Roger II took offence and refused to participate any longer. In France, [[Abbot Suger]] was elected by a great council at [[\u00c9tampes]] (and appointed by the Pope) to act as one of the regents during the king's absence on crusade. In Germany, further preaching was done by [[Adam of Ebrach]], and [[Otto of Freising]] also took the cross. The Germans planned to set out at [[Easter]], but did not leave until May.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 257, 259}}\n\n=== German route ===\nThe German crusaders, accompanied by the [[papal legate]] and [[cardinal (religion)|cardinal]] [[Theodwin of Santa Rufina|Theodwin]], intended to meet the French in [[Constantinople]]. [[Ottokar III of Styria]] joined Conrad at [[Vienna]], and Conrad's enemy [[G\u00e9za II of Hungary]] allowed them to pass through unharmed. When the German army of 20,000 men arrived in Byzantine territory, Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] feared they were going to attack him, and had Byzantine troops posted to ensure against trouble. A brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans occurred near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] and in [[Adrianople]], where the Byzantine general Prosouch fought with Conrad's nephew, the future emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]]. To make matters worse, some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September. On 10 September, however, they arrived at Constantinople, where relations with Manuel were poor, resulting in a [[Battle of Constantinople (1147)|battle]], after which the Germans became convinced that they should cross into [[Asia Minor]] as quickly as possible.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 42}} Manuel wanted Conrad to leave some of his troops behind, to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II, who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of Greece, but Conrad did not agree, despite being a fellow enemy of Roger.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 259\u2013267}}\n\nIn Asia Minor, Conrad decided not to wait for the French, but marched towards [[Iconium]], capital of the [[Seljuq Turks|Seljuq]] [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]]. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much of the authority of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 43}} Conrad underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} The Seljuqs almost totally destroyed King Conrad's party on 25 October 1147 at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1147)|second battle of Dorylaeum]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}\n\nIn battle, the Turks used their typical tactic of pretending to retreat, and then returning to attack the small force of German cavalry which had separated from the main army to chase them. Conrad began a slow retreat back to Constantinople, his army harassed daily by the Turks, who attacked stragglers and defeated the rearguard.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 47}} Conrad himself was wounded in a skirmish with them. The other division of the German force, led by the King's half-brother, Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], had marched south to the Mediterranean coast and was similarly defeated early in 1148.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 267\u2013270}} The force led by Otto ran out of food while crossing inhospitable countryside and was ambushed by the Seljuq Turks near Laodicea on 16 November 1147. The majority of Otto's force were either killed in battle or captured and sold into slavery.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}}\n\n=== French route ===\n[[File:C croisade2 Louis7.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis VII of France]]\nThe French crusaders had departed from [[Metz]] in June 1147, led by Louis, [[Thierry, Count of Flanders|Thierry of Alsace]], [[Renaut I of Bar]], [[Amadeus III of Savoy]] and his half-brother [[William V of Montferrat]], William VII of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and others, along with armies from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Brittany]], [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Aquitaine]]. A force from [[Provence]], led by Alphonse of Toulouse, chose to wait until August, and to cross by sea. At [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Louis joined with crusaders from [[Normandy]] and England. They followed Conrad's route fairly peacefully, although Louis came into conflict with king G\u00e9za of [[Hungary]] when G\u00e9za discovered that Louis had allowed a failed Hungarian usurper, [[Boris Kalamanos]], to join his army. Relations within Byzantine territory were also grim, and the Lorrainers, who had marched ahead of the rest of the French, also came into conflict with the slower Germans whom they met on the way.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=259\u2013263}}\n\nSince the original negotiations between Louis and Manuel I, Manuel had broken off his military campaign against R\u00fbm, signing a truce with his enemy Sultan [[Mesud I]]. Manuel did this to give himself a free hand to concentrate on defending his empire from the Crusaders, who had gained a reputation for theft and treachery since the [[First Crusade]] and were widely suspected of harbouring sinister designs on [[Constantinople]]. Nevertheless, Manuel's relations with the French army were somewhat better than with the Germans, and Louis was entertained lavishly in Constantinople. Some of the French were outraged by Manuel's truce with the Seljuqs and called for an alliance with Roger II and an attack on Constantinople, but Louis restrained them.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\n[[File:Manuelcomnenus.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Manuel I|alt= A standing male, dressed in elaborate robes with a fancy hat. He has a halo around his head and is holding a long staff in one hand.]]\n\nWhen the armies from Savoy, [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] and [[Montferrat]] joined Louis in Constantinople, having taken the land route through Italy and crossing from [[Brindisi]] to [[Durazzo]], the entire army took ship across the [[Bosporus]] to [[Asia Minor]]. The Greeks were encouraged by rumours that the Germans had captured [[Iconium]] (Konya), but Manuel refused to give Louis any Byzantine troops. [[Roger II of Sicily]] had just invaded Byzantine territory, and Manuel needed all his army in the [[Peloponnese]]. Both the Germans and French therefore entered Asia without any Byzantine assistance, unlike the armies of the First Crusade. Following the example set by his grandfather [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]], Manuel had the French swear to return to the Empire any territory they captured.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p= 269}}\n\nThe French met the remnants of Conrad's army at [[Lopadion]], and Conrad joined Louis's force. They followed Otto of Freising's route, moving closer to the Mediterranean coast, and arrived at [[Ephesus]] in December, where they learned that the Turks were preparing to attack them. Manuel also sent ambassadors complaining about the pillaging and plundering that Louis had done along the way, and there was no guarantee that the Byzantines would assist them against the Turks. Meanwhile, Conrad fell sick and returned to Constantinople, where Manuel attended to him personally, and Louis, paying no attention to the warnings of a Turkish attack, marched out from Ephesus with the French and German survivors. The Turks were indeed waiting to attack, but in a [[Battle of Ephesus (1147)|small battle]] outside Ephesus on 24 December 1147, the French proved victorious.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 270\u2013271}} The French fended off [[Battle of the Meander|another Turkish ambush]] at the Meander River in the same month.\n\nThey reached [[Laodicea on the Lycus]] early in January 1148, just after Otto of Freising's army had been destroyed in the same area.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=51}} Resuming the march, the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated from the rest of the army [[Battle of Mount Cadmus|at Mount Cadmus]], where Louis's troops suffered heavy losses from the Turks (6 January 1148). Louis himself, according to [[Odo of Deuil]], climbed a rock and was ignored by the Turks, who did not recognize him. The Turks did not bother to attack further and the French marched on to [[Antalya|Adalia]], continually harassed from afar by the Turks, who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food, both for themselves and their horses. Louis no longer wanted to continue by land, and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and to sail for Antioch.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} After being delayed for a month by storms, most of the promised ships did not arrive at all. Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves, while the rest of the army had to resume the long march to Antioch. The army was almost entirely destroyed, either by the Turks or by sickness.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 272\u2013273}}\n\n=== Journey to Jerusalem ===\n[[File:RaymondOfPoitiersWelcomingLouisVIIinAntioch.JPG|thumb|Raymond of Poitiers welcoming Louis VII in Antioch|alt= Painting of two men meeting in front of a city gate. Both men are in front of crowds of other people. The one on the left is bareheaded and holds his hat in one hand while he bows to the other figure, who is dressed in blue embroidered robes and wears a crown.]]\nThough delayed by storms, Louis eventually arrived in Antioch on 19 March; Amadeus of Savoy had died on [[Cyprus]] along the way. Louis was welcomed by Eleanor's uncle [[Raymond of Poitiers]]. Raymond expected him to help defend against the Turks and to accompany him on an expedition against Aleppo, the Muslim city that functioned as the gateway to Edessa, but Louis refused, preferring instead to finish his pilgrimage to Jerusalem rather than focus on the military aspect of the crusade.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} Eleanor enjoyed her stay, but her uncle implored her to remain to enlarge family lands and divorce Louis if the king refused to help what was assuredly the military cause of the Crusade.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 54}} During this period, there were rumours of an affair between Raymond and Eleanor, which caused tensions in the marriage between Louis and Eleanor.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 18, 54}} Louis quickly left Antioch for [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]] with Eleanor under arrest. Meanwhile, [[Otto of Freising]] and the remnant of his troops arrived in Jerusalem early in April, and Conrad soon after.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|pp= 49\u201350}} [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk]], the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], was sent to invite Louis to join them. The fleet that had stopped at Lisbon arrived around this time, as well as the Proven\u00e7als who had left Europe under the command of [[Alfonso Jordan]], [[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]]. Alfonso himself did not reach Jerusalem; he died at [[Caesarea]], supposedly poisoned by [[Raymond II of Tripoli]], the nephew who feared his political aspirations in the county. The claim that Raymond had poisoned Alfonso caused much of the Proven\u00e7al force to turn back and return home.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 54}} The original focus of the crusade was [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], but the preferred target of [[King Baldwin III]] and of the [[Knights Templar]] was [[Damascus]].{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp=115\u2013121}}\n\nIn response to the arrival of the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted. Unur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus. It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Unur might lose his city to the Crusaders.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 55}}\n\n=== Council of Palmarea ===\n{{main|Council of Acre}}\nThe nobility of Jerusalem welcomed the arrival of troops from Europe. A council to decide on the best target for the crusaders took place on 24 June 1148, when the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem]] met with the recently arrived crusaders from Europe at Palmarea, near [[Akko|Acre]], a major city of the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. This was the most spectacular meeting of the Court in its existence.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}{{sfn|William of Tyre|Babcock|Krey|1943|loc= vol. 2, bk. 17, ch. 1, pp. 184\u2013185: \"it seems well worth while and quite in harmony with the present history that the names of the nobles who were present at the council... should be recorded here for the benefit of posterity&nbsp;... to name each one individually would take far too long.\"}}\n\nIn the end, the decision was made to attack the city of Damascus, a former ally of the Kingdom of Jerusalem that had shifted its allegiance to that of the Zengids, and attacked the Kingdom's allied city of [[Battle of Bosra (1147)|Bosra]] in 1147.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 54\u201355}} Historians have long seen the decision to besiege Damascus rather than Edessa as \"an act of inexplicable folly\". Noting the tensions between Unur, the ''atabeg'' of Damascus, and the growing power of the Zangids, many historians have argued that it would have been better for the Crusaders to focus their energy against the Zangids. More recently, historians such as David Nicolle have defended the decision to attack Damascus, arguing that Damascus was the most powerful Muslim state in southern Syria, and that if the Christians held Damascus, they would have been in a better position to resist the rising power of [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]]. Since Unur was clearly the weaker of the two Muslim rulers, it was believed that it was inevitable that Nur ad-Din would take Damascus sometime in the near future, and thus it seemed better for the Crusaders to hold that city rather than the Zangids.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 37\u201338}} In July their armies assembled at [[Tiberias]] and marched to Damascus, around the [[Sea of Galilee]] by way of [[Banyas]]. There were perhaps 50,000 troops in total.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=228\u2013229}}\n\n=== Siege of Damascus ===\n{{main|Siege of Damascus (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Damascus.jpg|thumb|Siege of Damascus]]\nThe crusaders decided to attack Damascus from the west, where [[orchard]]s would provide them with a constant food supply.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July. The following day, the Muslims were prepared for the attack and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus. The defenders had sought help from [[Saif ad-Din Ghazi I]] of [[Mosul]] and Nur ad-Din of [[Aleppo]], who personally led an attack on the crusader camp. The crusaders were pushed back from the walls into the orchards, leaving them exposed to ambushes and guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Tyre]], on 27 July the crusaders decided to move to the plain on the eastern side of the city, which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible for the Crusaders to return to their better position.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July, though for their entire retreat they were followed by [[Seljuqids|Turkish]] archers who constantly harassed them.{{sfn|Baldwin|Setton|1969|p= 510}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|left|266px|The Mediterranean world after the Second Crusade in 1173|alt=Map showing the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. Along the west and southwest coasts is the Muwahid Caliphate. The Zangid Sultanate covers most of the southeast coast and the inland areas from the east coast, which is occupied by the Crusader States. The Byzantine Empire covers most of the northeast coast and inland areas. The center of the north coast is held by the Holy Roman Empire and the northwest coast is held by the kingdoms of France and Aragon.]]\n\nEach of the Christian forces felt betrayed by the other.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}} A new plan was made to attack [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, due to the lack of trust that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 77}}\n\nBack in Europe, [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard considered it his duty to send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his ''Book of Consideration''. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}} He would die in 1153.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}}\n\nThe cultural impact of the Second Crusade was even greater in France, with many [[troubadour]]s fascinated by the alleged affair between Eleanor and Raymond, which helped to feed the theme of courtly love. Unlike Conrad, the image of Louis was improved by the Crusade with many of the French seeing him as a suffering pilgrim king who quietly bore God's punishments.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81\u201384}}\n\n[[File:Saladin's Conquest (1174-1189).jpg|thumb|right|320px|Map of [[Saladin]]'s Conquest into [[the Levant]]]]\n\nRelations between the Eastern Roman Empire and the French were badly damaged by the Crusade. Louis and other French leaders openly accused the Emperor Manuel I of colluding with Turkish attacks on them during the march across Asia Minor. The memory of the Second Crusade was to color French views of the Byzantines for the rest of the 12th and 13th centuries. Within the empire itself, the crusade was remembered as a triumph of diplomacy.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}} In the eulogy for the Emperor Manuel by Archbishop [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], it was declared:\n\n<blockquote>He was able to deal with his enemies with enviable skill, playing off one against the other with the aim of bringing peace and tranquility{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}}</blockquote>\n\nThe preliminary Wendish Crusade achieved mixed results. While the Saxons affirmed their possession of Wagria and Polabia, pagans retained control of the Obodrite land east of L\u00fcbeck. The Saxons also received tribute from Chief Niklot, enabled the colonization of the [[Bishopric of Havelberg]], and freed some [[Danes|Danish]] prisoners. However, the disparate Christian leaders regarded their counterparts with suspicion and accused each other of sabotaging the campaign. In Iberia, the campaigns in Spain, along with the siege of Lisbon, were some of the few lasting Christian victories of the Second Crusade. They are seen as pivotal battles of the wider Reconquista, which would be completed in 1492.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=126}}\n\nIn the East the situation was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem. In 1149, the ''atabeg'' Anur died, at which point the amir Abu Sa'id Mujir al-Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule. The ''ra'is'' of Damascus and commander of the ''ahdath'' military Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ''ahdath'' had played a major role in defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved a greater share of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}} The in-fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81}} Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}}\n\nBaldwin III finally [[Siege of Ascalon|seized Ascalon]] in 1153, which brought [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] into the sphere of conflict. Jerusalem was able to make further advances into Egypt, briefly occupying [[Cairo]] in the 1160s.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=56}} However, relations with the Byzantine Empire were mixed, and reinforcements from Europe were sparse after the disaster of the Second Crusade. King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] allied with the Byzantines and participated in a combined invasion of Egypt in 1169, but the expedition ultimately failed. In 1171, [[Saladin]], nephew of one of Nur ad-Din's generals, was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt, uniting [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and completely surrounding the crusader kingdom. Meanwhile, the Byzantine alliance ended with the death of emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel I]] in 1180, and in 1187, [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Jerusalem capitulated]] to Saladin. His forces then spread north to capture all but the capital cities of the Crusader States, precipitating the [[Third Crusade]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=60}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{cite book|author=Bunson, Matthew, Margaret, & Stephen|title=Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints| publisher = Our Sunday Visitor| location = Huntington|year=1998| isbn = 978-0-87973-588-3 |ref=CITEREFBunson1998 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Baldwin | first = Mrshall W. |last2=Setton  |first2=Kenneth M. | title =A History of the Crusades, Volume I: The First Hundred Years | location = Madison, Wisconsin | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1969 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Barraclough | first = Geoffrey |author-link=Geoffrey Barraclough | title = The Origins of Modern Germany | year = 1984 | publisher = W.

He succeeded Ahidjo as president upon the latter's surprise resignation in 1982 and consolidated power in a 1983\u20131984 staged attempted coup{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} in which he eliminated all his rivals.\n\nHis regime is supported by France, which supplies it with weapons and trains its forces.

Under serious pressure, he accepted the introduction of multiparty politics in the early 1990s. He won the contentious [[1992 Cameroonian presidential election|1992 presidential election]] with 40% of the plural, single-ballot vote and was re-elected by large margins in 1997, 2004, 2011 and 2018. Opposition politicians and Western governments have alleged voting irregularities and fraud on each of these occasions. Many independent sources have provided evidence that he did not win the elections in 1992, and that subsequent elections were rampant with fraud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cameroonvoice.com/news/article-news-8679.html|title=Elections.

He studied at the Lyc\u00e9e General Leclerc, [[Yaound\u00e9]], and in France at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand]], [[Paris]], going on to the [[\u00c9cole Nationale de la France d'Outre-Mer|Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes d'Outre-Mer]], where he graduated in 1961 with a Higher Education Diploma in Public Law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prc.cm/en/the-president/biography|title=Biography|website=www.prc.cm}}</ref> He married [[Jeanne-Ir\u00e8ne Biya]], who did not have any children, though she adopted Franck Biya who was born from a relationship of Paul Biya with another woman.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} After Jeanne-Ir\u00e8ne Biya died on 29 July 1992, Paul Biya married [[Chantal Biya]] (37 years his junior) on 23 April 1994,<ref name=Elect/> and had two more children with her. Biya is a good friend of the former [[Angola]]n President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]].\n\n==Political career==\nAs an official in post-independence 1960s Cameroon, Biya rose to prominence under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. After becoming Director of the Cabinet of the Minister of National Education in January 1964 and Secretary-General of the Ministry of National Education in July 1965, he was named Director of the Civil Cabinet of the President in December 1967 and Secretary-General of the Presidency (while remaining Director of the Civil Cabinet) in January 1968. He gained the rank of Minister in August 1968 and the rank of Minister of State in June 1970, while remaining Secretary-General of the Presidency. Following the creation of a [[unitary state]] in 1972, he became [[Prime Minister of Cameroon]] on 30 June 1975. In June 1979, a law designated the Prime Minister as the President's constitutional successor. Ahidjo unexpectedly announced his resignation on 4 November 1982, and Biya accordingly succeeded him as President of Cameroon on 6 November.<ref name=Pres/><ref name=Elect/>\n\nBecause Biya is a [[Christianity|Christian]] from the South Region of Cameroon, it was considered surprising that he was chosen by Ahidjo, a [[Islam|Muslim]] from the north, as his successor. His father who was a catechist wanted him to be in the clergy but at the age of 16 while in Catholic school, he was dismissed. After Biya became President, Ahidjo initially remained head of the ruling [[Cameroon National Union]] (CNU). Biya was brought into the CNU Central Committee and Political Bureau and was elected as the Vice-President of the CNU. On 11 December 1982, he was placed in charge of managing party affairs in Ahidjo's absence. During the first months after Biya's succession, he continued to show loyalty to Ahidjo, and Ahidjo continued to show support for Biya, but in 1983 a deep rift developed between the two. Ahidjo went into exile in France, and from there he publicly accused Biya of abuse of power and paranoia about plots against him. The two could not be reconciled despite efforts by several foreign leaders. After Ahidjo resigned as CNU leader, Biya took the helm of the party at an \"extraordinary session\" of the CNU party held on 14 September 1983.<ref name=KT>Milton H. Krieger and Joseph Takougang, ''African State and Society in the 1990s: Cameroon's Political Crossroads'' (2000), Westview Press, pages 65\u201374.</ref>\n\nIn November 1983, Biya announced that the next presidential election would be held on 14 January 1984; it had been previously scheduled for 1985. He was the sole candidate in this election and won 99.98% of the vote.<ref name=KT/> In February 1984, Ahidjo was put on trial ''in absentia'' for alleged involvement in a 1983 [[coup]] plot, along with two others; they were sentenced to death, although Biya commuted their sentences to life in prison, a gesture seen by many as a sign of weakness.<ref name=WP>Jonathan C.

According to official results, Biya won the [[1992 Cameroonian presidential election|first multiparty presidential election]], held on 11 October 1992, with about 40% of the vote.  There was no provision for a runoff; the opposition was unable to unite around a single candidate.

Since the early 1990s, he has faced his strongest opposition from the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] population of the former [[Southern Cameroons]] in the western part of the country.\n\nAlthough Biya made some efforts to open up the political environment, his regime still retains clear [[authoritarianism|authoritarian characteristics]] and has largely bucked the trend toward democracy in Africa since the 1990s.  Under the constitution, Biya has sweeping executive and legislative powers.  He even has considerable authority over the judiciary; the courts can only review a law's constitutionality at his request.  The RDPC continues to dominate the National Assembly, which does little more than approve his policies.\n\n\"Tyrants, the World's 20 Worst Living Dictators\", by [[David Wallechinsky]], ranked Biya with three others commonly in sub-Saharan Africa: [[Robert Mugabe]] of [[Zimbabwe]], [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]] of [[Equatorial Guinea]], and [[Mswati III|King Mswati]] of [[Swaziland]]. He describes Cameroon's electoral process in these terms: \"Every few years, Biya stages an election to justify his continuing reign, but these elections have no credibility. In fact, Biya is credited with a creative innovation in the world of phony elections. In 2004, annoyed by the criticisms of international vote-monitoring groups, he paid for his own set of international observers, six ex-U.S. congressmen, who certified his election as free and fair.\"<ref>David Wallechinsky, \"Tyrants: the World's 20 Worst Living Dictators\", Regan Press, 2006, pp. 286\u2013290</ref> In a 2005 interview [[William Quantrill (diplomat)|William Quantrill]], a retired member of [[HM Diplomatic Service]], argued that the reluctance of Biya to delegate responsibility seriously hampered the quality of governance, with trivial decisions often delayed until he got round to delivering them, and that there was too much government interference in the economy in general.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kometa |first1=Georgiana Magho |title=There Was Disparity Between Biya's Professed Policies And Reality -Former British Ambassador |url=https://www.postnewsline.com/2005/06/strongthere_was.html |website=Up Station Mountain Club |accessdate=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nBiya regularly spends extended periods of time in [[Switzerland]] at the Hotel [[InterContinental]] [[Geneva]] where the former director Herbert Schott reportedly said he comes to work without being disturbed.<ref>Jean Francis Belibi {{cite web |url=http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200710300790.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110629144705/http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200710300790.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 June 2011 |title=Cameroun: Herbert Schott \u2013 Paul Biya est un sacr\u00e9 personnage |access-date=1 September 2016}}. fr.allafrica.com. 30 October 2007 (in French)</ref> These extended stays away from Cameroon \u2013 while sometimes as short as two weeks \u2013 are sometimes as long as three months and are almost always referred to as \"short stays\" in the state-owned press and other media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prc.cm/index_fr.php?link=magazine/sejour_prive_europe_310507 |title=Le Chef de l\u2019Etat en s\u00e9jour priv\u00e9 en Europe |publisher=Prc.cm |accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prc.cm/index_en.php?link=magazine/retour_sejour_prive_europe_190607 |title=Le Pr\u00e9sident est de retour |language=French|publisher=Prc.cm |accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref> In February 2008, he passed a bill that allows for having an additional term in office as president which was followed by civil unrests throughout the country.

After becoming Director of the Cabinet of the Minister of National Education in January 1964 and Secretary-General of the Ministry of National Education in July 1965, he was named Director of the Civil Cabinet of the President in December 1967 and Secretary-General of the Presidency (while remaining Director of the Civil Cabinet) in January 1968. He gained the rank of Minister in August 1968 and the rank of Minister of State in June 1970, while remaining Secretary-General of the Presidency. Following the creation of a [[unitary state]] in 1972, he became [[Prime Minister of Cameroon]] on 30 June 1975. In June 1979, a law designated the Prime Minister as the President's constitutional successor. Ahidjo unexpectedly announced his resignation on 4 November 1982, and Biya accordingly succeeded him as President of Cameroon on 6 November.<ref name=Pres/><ref name=Elect/>\n\nBecause Biya is a [[Christianity|Christian]] from the South Region of Cameroon, it was considered surprising that he was chosen by Ahidjo, a [[Islam|Muslim]] from the north, as his successor. His father who was a catechist wanted him to be in the clergy but at the age of 16 while in Catholic school, he was dismissed. After Biya became President, Ahidjo initially remained head of the ruling [[Cameroon National Union]] (CNU). Biya was brought into the CNU Central Committee and Political Bureau and was elected as the Vice-President of the CNU. On 11 December 1982, he was placed in charge of managing party affairs in Ahidjo's absence. During the first months after Biya's succession, he continued to show loyalty to Ahidjo, and Ahidjo continued to show support for Biya, but in 1983 a deep rift developed between the two. Ahidjo went into exile in France, and from there he publicly accused Biya of abuse of power and paranoia about plots against him. The two could not be reconciled despite efforts by several foreign leaders. After Ahidjo resigned as CNU leader, Biya took the helm of the party at an \"extraordinary session\" of the CNU party held on 14 September 1983.<ref name=KT>Milton H.

The change also provided for the President to enjoy immunity from prosecution for his actions as President after leaving office.<ref>[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/fluxafp/fil_info.asp?art_cle=44617 \"Cameroun: adoption d'une r\u00e9vision constitutionnelle controvers\u00e9e\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522000318/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/fluxafp/fil_info.asp?art_cle=44617 |date=22 May 2011 }}, AFP, 10 April 2008 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref>\n[[File:Paul Biya with Obamas 2014.jpg|thumb|Biya with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] in 2014]]\n\nHe has been consistently re-elected as the National President of the RDPC; he was re-elected at the party's second extraordinary congress on 7 July 2001 and its third extraordinary congress on 21 July 2006.<ref>[http://www.camerounlink.net/fr/news.php?nid=24113&kat=1&seite=195 \"21 ANS DE T\u00c2TONNEMENT\"], Camerounlink.net, 21 July 2007 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/079/article_45203.asp \"Paul Biya r\u00e9\u00e9lu sans surprise \u00e0 la t\u00eate du RDPC\"], rfi.fr, 22 July 2006 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref>\n\nOn 12 June 2006 he signed the [[Greentree Agreement]] with Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] which formally put an end to the [[Bakassi]] peninsula border dispute.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sgsm11745.doc.htm|title=AGREEMENT TRANSFERRING AUTHORITY OVER BAKASSI PENINSULA FROM NIGERIA TO CAMEROON \u2018TRIUMPH FOR THE RULE OF LAW\u2019, SECRETARY-GENERAL SAYS IN MESSAGE FOR CEREMONY - Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2008, riots broke out, calling for lower prices and the departure of Paul Biya.

Since the early 1990s, he has faced his strongest opposition from the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] population of the former [[Southern Cameroons]] in the western part of the country.\n\nAlthough Biya made some efforts to open up the political environment, his regime still retains clear [[authoritarianism|authoritarian characteristics]] and has largely bucked the trend toward democracy in Africa since the 1990s.  Under the constitution, Biya has sweeping executive and legislative powers.  He even has considerable authority over the judiciary; the courts can only review a law's constitutionality at his request.  The RDPC continues to dominate the National Assembly, which does little more than approve his policies.\n\n\"Tyrants, the World's 20 Worst Living Dictators\", by [[David Wallechinsky]], ranked Biya with three others commonly in sub-Saharan Africa: [[Robert Mugabe]] of [[Zimbabwe]], [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]] of [[Equatorial Guinea]], and [[Mswati III|King Mswati]] of [[Swaziland]]. He describes Cameroon's electoral process in these terms: \"Every few years, Biya stages an election to justify his continuing reign, but these elections have no credibility. In fact, Biya is credited with a creative innovation in the world of phony elections. In 2004, annoyed by the criticisms of international vote-monitoring groups, he paid for his own set of international observers, six ex-U.S. congressmen, who certified his election as free and fair.\"<ref>David Wallechinsky, \"Tyrants: the World's 20 Worst Living Dictators\", Regan Press, 2006, pp. 286\u2013290</ref> In a 2005 interview [[William Quantrill (diplomat)|William Quantrill]], a retired member of [[HM Diplomatic Service]], argued that the reluctance of Biya to delegate responsibility seriously hampered the quality of governance, with trivial decisions often delayed until he got round to delivering them, and that there was too much government interference in the economy in general.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kometa |first1=Georgiana Magho |title=There Was Disparity Between Biya's Professed Policies And Reality -Former British Ambassador |url=https://www.postnewsline.com/2005/06/strongthere_was.html |website=Up Station Mountain Club |accessdate=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nBiya regularly spends extended periods of time in [[Switzerland]] at the Hotel [[InterContinental]] [[Geneva]] where the former director Herbert Schott reportedly said he comes to work without being disturbed.<ref>Jean Francis Belibi {{cite web |url=http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200710300790.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110629144705/http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200710300790.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 June 2011 |title=Cameroun: Herbert Schott \u2013 Paul Biya est un sacr\u00e9 personnage |access-date=1 September 2016}}. fr.allafrica.com. 30 October 2007 (in French)</ref> These extended stays away from Cameroon \u2013 while sometimes as short as two weeks \u2013 are sometimes as long as three months and are almost always referred to as \"short stays\" in the state-owned press and other media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prc.cm/index_fr.php?link=magazine/sejour_prive_europe_310507 |title=Le Chef de l\u2019Etat en s\u00e9jour priv\u00e9 en Europe |publisher=Prc.cm |accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prc.cm/index_en.php?link=magazine/retour_sejour_prive_europe_190607 |title=Le Pr\u00e9sident est de retour |language=French|publisher=Prc.cm |accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref> In February 2008, he passed a bill that allows for having an additional term in office as president which was followed by civil unrests throughout the country.

The song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year. Dylan recorded the song in September 1974, but as with some other songs from ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', re-recorded it in December 1974. Between the recordings, he often reworked the lyrics. A live version of the song was released on Dylan's 1976 album ''[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]'', and all of the studio outtakes from the September sessions were released on the deluxe edition of ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks]]'' in 2018. Some reviewers have speculated that the song is a reflection on Dylan's personal life, and in particular on his deteriorating relationship with his wife [[Sara Dylan]], whilst Dylan has denied that it is autobiographical.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year and a separation from [[Sara Dylan]], who he had married in 1965. Dylan had moved to a farm in Minnesota with his brother, David Zimmerman and there started to write the songs that were recorded for his album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]''.<ref name=\"UNCUT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656/ |title=Shelter From The Storm \u2013 the inside story of Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks |last=Hasted |first=Nick |date=15 November 2013 |work=Uncut |access-date=6 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715011356/https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656 |archive-date=15 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the Spring of 1974, Dylan had taken art classes at [[Carnegie Hall]] and was influenced by his tutor [[Norman Raeben]].<ref name=\"UNCUT\" /><ref name=\"Rogovoy2009\">{{cite book|author=Seth Rogovoy|title=Bob Dylan: Prophet, Mystic, Poet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdbgeObYgIkC&pg=PA160|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-5983-2}}</ref>{{rp|160}} and, in particular, Raeben's view of [[time]].<ref name=\"GillOdegard2004\">{{cite book|author1=Andy Gill|author2=Kevin Odegard|title=A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks|url=https://archive.org/details/simpletwistoffat00gill|url-access=registration|date=January 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81231-6}}</ref> Dylan was later to say that \"Idiot Wind\" was \"a song I wanted to make as a painting.\"<ref name=\"Flanagan2010\">{{cite book|author=Bill Flanagan|title=Written in My Soul: Conversations with Rock's Great Songwriters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|date=1 April 2010|publisher=RosettaBooks|isbn=978-0-7953-1081-2|access-date=6 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506011534/https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> \"Idiot Wind\" was a derogatory phrase employed by Raeben and this may have inspired Dylan's use of it, although the term also appears in the poem ''June 1940'' by [[Weldon Kees]] and that may have been the reference point.<ref name=\"Wilentz2011\">{{cite book|author=Sean Wilentz|title=Bob Dylan in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sb5UygkZlH0C&pg=PA140|date=15 February 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-7411-5|}}{{rp|140-141}}</ref>\n\nDylan first recorded \"Idiot Wind\" in New York City on 12 September 1974 during the initial ''Blood on the Tracks'' sessions at [[A & R Recording|A&R Studios]].

The song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year. Dylan recorded the song in September 1974, but as with some other songs from ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', re-recorded it in December 1974. Between the recordings, he often reworked the lyrics. A live version of the song was released on Dylan's 1976 album ''[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]'', and all of the studio outtakes from the September sessions were released on the deluxe edition of ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks]]'' in 2018.

This layer \u2013 conventionally called a [[surface layer]] \u2013 constitutes about 10% of the total PBL depth. Above the surface layer the PBL turbulence gradually dissipates, losing its kinetic energy to friction as well as converting the kinetic to potential energy in a density stratified flow. The balance between the rate of the turbulent kinetic energy production and its dissipation determines the planetary boundary layer depth. The PBL depth varies broadly. At a given wind speed, e.g. 8&nbsp;m/s, and so at a given rate of the turbulence production, a PBL in wintertime Arctic could be as shallow as 50&nbsp;m, a nocturnal PBL in mid-latitudes could be typically 300&nbsp;m in thickness, and a tropical PBL in the trade-wind zone could grow to its full theoretical depth of 2000&nbsp;m.\n\nIn addition to the surface layer, the planetary boundary layer also comprises the PBL ''core'' (between 0.1 and 0.7 of the PBL depth) and the PBL top or ''entrainment layer'' or ''capping inversion layer'' (between 0.7 and 1 of the PBL depth). Four main external factors determine the PBL depth and its mean vertical structure: \n# the free atmosphere wind speed;\n# the surface heat (more exactly buoyancy) balance;\n# the free atmosphere density stratification;\n# the free atmosphere vertical wind shear or [[baroclinicity]].\n\n{{further|Ekman layer}}\n\n==Principal types==\n[[File:Atmospheric boundary layer.svg|thumbnail]]\n\n===Convective planetary boundary layer (CBL)===\n{{main|Convective planetary boundary layer}}\nA convective planetary boundary layer  is a type of planetary boundary layer where positive buoyancy flux at the surface creates a thermal instability and thus generates additional or even major turbulence. (This is also known as having CAPE or [[convective available potential energy]]); see [[atmospheric convection]].) A convective boundary layer is typical in tropical and mid-latitudes during daytime. Solar heating assisted by the heat released from the water vapor condensation could create so strong convective turbulence that the [[Free convective layer]] comprises the entire troposphere up to the [[tropopause]] (the boundary in the Earth's atmosphere between the [[troposphere]] and the [[stratosphere]]), which is at 10&nbsp;km to 18&nbsp;km in the [[Intertropical convergence zone]]).\n\n===Stably stratified planetary boundary layer (SBL)===\nThe SBL is a PBL when negative buoyancy flux at the surface damps the turbulence; see [[Convective inhibition]]. An SBL is solely driven by the wind shear turbulence and hence the SBL cannot exist without the free atmosphere wind. An SBL is typical in nighttime at all locations and even in daytime in places where the Earth's surface is colder than the air above. An SBL plays a particularly important role in high latitudes where it is often prolonged (days to months), resulting in very cold air temperatures.\n\nPhysical laws and equations of motions, which govern the planetary boundary layer dynamics and microphysics, are strongly non-linear and considerably influenced by properties of the Earth's surface and evolution of the processes in the free atmosphere. To deal with this complicity, the whole array of [[turbulence models|turbulence modelling]] has been proposed. However, they are often not accurate enough to meet practical requests. Significant improvements are expected from application of a [[large eddy simulation]] technique to problems related to the PBL.\n\nPerhaps the most important processes, which are critically dependent on the correct representation of the PBL in the atmospheric models ([[Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project]]), are turbulent transport of moisture ([[evapotranspiration]]) and pollutants ([[Air pollution|air pollutants]]). [[Cloud]]s in the boundary layer influence [[trade wind]]s, the [[hydrological cycle]], and energy exchange.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Alpine planetary boundary layer]]\n*[[Boundary layer]]\n*[[Turbulence]]\n*[[Wind shear]]\n*[[Microburst]]\n*[[Atmospheric physics]]\n*[[Atmospheric sciences]]\n*[[Atmospheric electricity]]\n*[[Astronomical seeing]]\n*[[Mixed layer]]\n*[[Remote sensing atmospheric boundary layer]]\n*[[Representations of the atmospheric boundary layer in global climate models]]\n*[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.theweatherprediction.com/basic/pbl/ Description of the planetary boundary layer] at [http://www.theweatherprediction.com/ theweatherprediction.com]\n*[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=atmospheric-boundary-layer1 American Meteorological Society glossary entry]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Planetary Boundary Layer}}\n[[Category:Boundary layer meteorology]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n\n[[fr:Couche limite#M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|The lowest part of the atmosphere directly influenced by contact with the planetary surface}}\n{{distinguish|planetary boundaries}}\n[[File:The air over Los Angeles.ogv|thumb|300px|This movie is a combined visualization of the PBL and wind dynamics over the Los Angeles basin for a one-month period.

Four main external factors determine the PBL depth and its mean vertical structure: \n# the free atmosphere wind speed;\n# the surface heat (more exactly buoyancy) balance;\n# the free atmosphere density stratification;\n# the free atmosphere vertical wind shear or [[baroclinicity]].\n\n{{further|Ekman layer}}\n\n==Principal types==\n[[File:Atmospheric boundary layer.svg|thumbnail]]\n\n===Convective planetary boundary layer (CBL)===\n{{main|Convective planetary boundary layer}}\nA convective planetary boundary layer  is a type of planetary boundary layer where positive buoyancy flux at the surface creates a thermal instability and thus generates additional or even major turbulence. (This is also known as having CAPE or [[convective available potential energy]]); see [[atmospheric convection]].) A convective boundary layer is typical in tropical and mid-latitudes during daytime. Solar heating assisted by the heat released from the water vapor condensation could create so strong convective turbulence that the [[Free convective layer]] comprises the entire troposphere up to the [[tropopause]] (the boundary in the Earth's atmosphere between the [[troposphere]] and the [[stratosphere]]), which is at 10&nbsp;km to 18&nbsp;km in the [[Intertropical convergence zone]]).\n\n===Stably stratified planetary boundary layer (SBL)===\nThe SBL is a PBL when negative buoyancy flux at the surface damps the turbulence; see [[Convective inhibition]]. An SBL is solely driven by the wind shear turbulence and hence the SBL cannot exist without the free atmosphere wind. An SBL is typical in nighttime at all locations and even in daytime in places where the Earth's surface is colder than the air above. An SBL plays a particularly important role in high latitudes where it is often prolonged (days to months), resulting in very cold air temperatures.\n\nPhysical laws and equations of motions, which govern the planetary boundary layer dynamics and microphysics, are strongly non-linear and considerably influenced by properties of the Earth's surface and evolution of the processes in the free atmosphere. To deal with this complicity, the whole array of [[turbulence models|turbulence modelling]] has been proposed. However, they are often not accurate enough to meet practical requests. Significant improvements are expected from application of a [[large eddy simulation]] technique to problems related to the PBL.\n\nPerhaps the most important processes, which are critically dependent on the correct representation of the PBL in the atmospheric models ([[Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project]]), are turbulent transport of moisture ([[evapotranspiration]]) and pollutants ([[Air pollution|air pollutants]]). [[Cloud]]s in the boundary layer influence [[trade wind]]s, the [[hydrological cycle]], and energy exchange.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Alpine planetary boundary layer]]\n*[[Boundary layer]]\n*[[Turbulence]]\n*[[Wind shear]]\n*[[Microburst]]\n*[[Atmospheric physics]]\n*[[Atmospheric sciences]]\n*[[Atmospheric electricity]]\n*[[Astronomical seeing]]\n*[[Mixed layer]]\n*[[Remote sensing atmospheric boundary layer]]\n*[[Representations of the atmospheric boundary layer in global climate models]]\n*[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.theweatherprediction.com/basic/pbl/ Description of the planetary boundary layer] at [http://www.theweatherprediction.com/ theweatherprediction.com]\n*[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=atmospheric-boundary-layer1 American Meteorological Society glossary entry]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Planetary Boundary Layer}}\n[[Category:Boundary layer meteorology]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n\n[[fr:Couche limite#M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie]]\n", "name_user": "BenBuc", "label": "safe", "comment": "Inserted wikilink to Eddy (fluid dynamics) in \"Atmospheric stability occurring at night with radiative cooling tends to contain turbulent eddies vertically\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundary_layer"}

{"title_page": "Midrasha", "text_new": "A '''''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{hebrew|\u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05d4}}, pl. ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot/midrashas}}'') is an institute of [[Torah study]] for women, generally in [[Israel]], and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men. \nAn alternative term, and translation, is '[[seminary]]' ({{hebrew|\u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05e8}}); <ref name=\"science.co.il\">[https://www.science.co.il/jewish-studies/Midrashot.php ''Midrashot''], science.co.il</ref> these are modeled on the [[Sarah_Schenirer#Teacher's_Seminary|institution established by Sarah Schenirer]] in 1923.\n\"''Midrasha''\" is often associated with Religious Zionist institutions, while \"Seminary\" refers to ''[[Haredi]]'' institutions.\nA ''midrasha'' that offers [[academic degree|degree studies]] is sometimes called a ''machon'' ({{hebrew|\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df}}, institute).\n\nThe word \"''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''\" is based on the term ''[[beit midrash]]'', \"house of study\".  It is [[cognate]] with the [[Arabic]] \"''{{transl|ar|[[madrasa|madrasah]]}}'',\" which also refers to a place of learning.\n\nThe term ''Midrasha'' is sometimes used  more widely, referring to [[Cultural Judaism|pluralistic]], as opposed to [[orthodox Judaism|orthodox]], educational  institutions.\nIt may also refer to [[field school]]s that organize seminars and nature field trips.<ref name=\"science.co.il\"/>\n\n==Structure==\n===Curriculum===\n''{{lang|he-Latn|Midrashot}}'' and seminaries vary in curriculum and ''[[hashkafah]]'', or outlook. \n<ref name=\"Lilith\">[https://www.lilith.org/blog/2014/09/a-modest-year-in-israel-when-young-women-go-to-seminary/ A Modest Year in Israel: When Young Women go to \u201cSeminary\u201d]. [[Lilith (magazine)|''Lilith'']], 2014 </ref>\nAll cover [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Halacha|Jewish law]]  and [[Musar Literature|Musar (Ethics)]] / [[Hasidic philosophy|''Hasidus'']].<ref name=\"science.co.il\"/> \nDepending on the institution's stance, the weight and role assigned to Talmud particularly, and in fact to textual-skills generally, will differ re men's yeshivot, and between ''midrashot''.<ref name=\"Lilith\"/>\nSee [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]] for the general content of each topic. \n\n[[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' include the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]'s [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]], sister school of [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]].\nTreatment of Tanakh and Jewish philosophy,  referred to here as [[Jewish thought|''Machshavah'']],  will typically be text-focused, built around [[chavruta]]-based study as at yeshivot.<ref name=\"Lilith\"/>\nThis entails paired-study where assigned sources are prepared for ''[[shiur]]'', a lecture delivered as a discursive-review.\nAt some institutions, [[Talmud]] is studied directly, also as at men's ''yeshivot'', if less intensively (see [[Women in Judaism #Joseph Solovetchik]]); others treat Talmud as at Seminaries, below.\nRegardless, Jewish law will generally be studied with ''practice'' in view: i.e., as opposed to [[Yeshiva#Jewish_law|at a men's Yeshiva]], where the derivation is from Talmudic sources through codification. (At [[Matan_Women's_Institute_for_Torah_Studies|Matan]], [[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] and [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] the treatment is Talmud-based; see also [[Drisha Institute]].<ref>[https://www.drisha.co.il/ drisha.co.il]: \"\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05d1\u05e7\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05d4\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4\"</ref>)\nWomen usually attend ''Midrasha'' for one year, following or before ''[[Sherut Leumi]]'' (national service); a second year is sometimes offered. Programs often emphasize ''Machshavah'', deepening their students' religious identity at this stage;<ref>See discussion at the corresponding Hebrew article: [[:he: \u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05d4_\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea_\u05dc\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd]] </ref> this includes the writings of [[Rav Kook]], and ''[[Torat Eretz Yisrael]]'' in general.\n\nThe [[Haredi]] aligned seminaries - for example [[Beth Jacob Jerusalem]] - are modeled on the [[Beis Yaakov]] teacher-training seminary established by [[Sarah Schenirer]].\n(''Beis Yaakov'' almost invariably refers to high school, while \"Seminary\" is used for a post-high school institution.)\nSeminaries are typically more conservative in their approach than ''Midrashot'':\nselections from the Talmud - usually the non-legalistic ''[[aggadah]]'' - may be studied, but only in the context of other classes, especially philosophy and Musar; \nthese institutions then also assign less weight to textual skills,<ref name=\"Lilith\"/> with content delivered primarily via lecture.\n(See [[Bais Yaakov #Curriculum]], [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]].)\n[[Bais_Yaakov#Hasidic_schools|Hasidic-aligned institutions]], for example [[Beth Rivkah]], are similarly positioned; their curricula differ in that they emphasize the works of their respective [[Rebbe]]. \nParallel to their academic content, most Seminaries also focus on [[Hashkafa#Gender_roles|the role of women in Torah]] - covering topics such as ''[[Tzniut]]'' (modesty), ''[[Shalom Bayit]]'' (\"domestic peace\") and ''[[Chinuch]]'' (education of one's children) - with these classes emphasizing ''values'', as opposed to sources. <ref name=\"Lilith\"/>\n(Several ''Midrashot'' similarly.<ref name =\"tal\"/>)\nThe programs usually span two years; see below.\n\nMany diaspora-based Orthodox Jewish girls attend a ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}'', or \u201csem\u201d, in Israel for a year or more following high school; \nseveral ''midrashot'' and seminaries offer special programs, for example ''Shana Ba'aretz'' at Nishmat, or  the \"Overseas Program\" at [[Midreshet HaRova]].\nAdditional to Torah study, these usually include <ref name=\"Lilith\"/> [[Tourism_in_Israel|touring of Israel]], [[Shabbaton]]s in various communities, and often volunteer work in local schools and hospitals, and seminars with journalists and politicians.\nSome institutions accommodate  [[baal teshuva|the newly observant]] with similar year-programs, designed to build knowledge and skills;

He was the [[Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg|Bishop of Johannesburg]] from 1985 to 1986 and then the [[Archbishop of Cape Town]] from 1986 to 1996, in both cases being the first black African to hold the position. Theologically, he sought to fuse ideas from [[black theology]] with [[African theology]]; politically, he identifies as a [[socialist]].\n\nTutu was born of mixed [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Motswana]] heritage to a poor family in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Union of South Africa]]. Entering adulthood, he trained as a teacher and married [[Nomalizo Leah Tutu]], with whom he had several children. In 1960, he was ordained as an Anglican priest and in 1962 moved to the United Kingdom to study theology at [[King's College London]]. In 1966 he returned to southern Africa, teaching at the [[Federal Theological Seminary of Southern Africa|Federal Theological Seminary]] and then the [[University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland]]. In 1972, he became the Theological Education Fund's director for Africa, a position based in [[London]] but necessitating regular tours of the African continent. Back in southern Africa in 1975, he served first as [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Johannesburg]] and then as [[Bishop of Lesotho]], taking an active role in opposition to South Africa's [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[White South African|white-minority]] rule. From 1978 to 1985 he was general-secretary of the [[South African Council of Churches]], emerging as one of South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid activists. Although warning the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government that anger at apartheid would lead to racial violence, as an activist he stressed [[non-violent protest]] and foreign economic pressure to bring about [[universal suffrage]].\n\nIn 1985, Tutu became Bishop of Johannesburg and in 1986 the Archbishop of Cape Town, the most senior position in southern Africa's Anglican hierarchy. In this position he emphasised a consensus-building model of leadership and oversaw the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|introduction of women priests]]. Also in 1986, he became president of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]], resulting in further tours of the continent. After President [[F. W. de Klerk]] released the anti-apartheid activist [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison in 1990 and the pair led negotiations to end apartheid and introduce multi-racial democracy, Tutu assisted as a mediator between rival black factions. After the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]] resulted in a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|coalition government]] headed by Mandela, the latter selected Tutu to chair the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past human rights abuses committed by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. Since apartheid's fall, Tutu has campaigned for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]] and spoken out on a wide range of subjects, among them the [[Israel-Palestine conflict]], his opposition to the [[Iraq War]], and his criticism of South African Presidents [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Jacob Zuma]].

White conservatives who supported apartheid despised him, while many white [[liberalism|liberals]] regarded him as too radical; many black radicals accused him of being too moderate and focused on cultivating white goodwill, while [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninists]] criticised his [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance.

despite his objections to Hani's Marxist beliefs, Tutu had admired him as an activist.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=140|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=333\u2013334}} Amid these events, Tutu had experienced physical exhaustion and ill-health,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=327}} and he undertook a four-month sabbatical at [[Emory University]]'s Candler School of Theology in Atlanta, Georgia.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=329}}\n\nTutu had been exhilarated by the prospect that South Africa was transforming towards universal suffrage via a negotiated transition rather than a racial civil war.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He allowed his face to be used on posters encouraging South Africans to vote.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=142}} When the [[South African general election, 1994|April 1994 multi-racial general election]] took place, Tutu was visibly exuberant, telling reporters that \"we are on cloud nine\".{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=142|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=338}} He voted in Cape Town's [[Gugulethu]] township.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=142|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=338}} The ANC won the election and Mandela was declared president, overseeing the formation of a government of national unity.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=143|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=339}} Tutu attended Mandela's inauguration ceremony and had been responsible for planning its religious component; Tutu had insisted that it be a multi-religious ceremony, with Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and Hindu leaders taking part in prayers and readings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\n====International affairs====\n\nAlongside his domestic work, he also turned his attention to events elsewhere in Africa, and in 1987 gave the keynote speech at the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]] (AACC) in [[Lom\u00e9]], Togo. There, he called on churches to champion the oppressed throughout the continent, stating that \"it pains us to have to admit that there is less freedom and personal liberty in most of Africa now then there was during the much-maligned colonial days.\"{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=347\u2013348}} At the conference, he was elected president of the AACC, while [[Jos\u00e9 Belo]] was elected its general-secretary. Calling for an \"African renaissance\" across the continent, the pair formed a partnership that would last a decade.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=375}} In 1989 they visited Zaire to encourage the country's churches to distance themselves from Seko's autocratic government.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=375}} In 1994, he and Belo visited war-torn Liberia in a mission co-organised by the AACC and the [[Carter Center]]. There, they met [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], but Tutu did not trust his promise of a ceasefire.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=376\u2013377}} In 1995, Mandela sent Tutu to Nigeria to meet with Nigerian military leader [[Sani Abacha]] to request the release of imprisoned politicians [[Moshood Abiola]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=377}} In July 1995, he visited Rwanda a year after the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]], where he preached to 10,000 people in [[Kigali]]. Drawing on his experiences in South Africa, he called for justice to be tempered with mercy towards the Hutu who had orchestrated the genocide.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=377\u2013378}} Tutu also travelled to other parts of world, for instance spending March 1989 in Panama and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=130}}\n\nTutu also spoke out on the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]]. While in New York in 1989, he had praised God for the creation of the state of Israel and asserted its right to \"territorial integrity and fundamental security against attacks from those who deny her right to exist\".{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=129|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=383}} He visited [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]] in Cairo, urging him to accept Israel's existence.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=385}} At the same time he expressed anger that Israel had supplied military hardware to South Africa during the apartheid era, expressing bemusement as to how the Jewish state could co-operate with a government that had contained many Nazi sympathisers.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=382\u2013383, 384}} Referring to the [[Israeli-occupied territories]] in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, he stated that there were \"deeply, deeply distressing\" parallels with the situation in apartheid South Africa.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=384}} He called for the formation of a distinct Palestinian state,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}} and emphasised that his criticisms were of the Israeli government rather than Jews as a broader group.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=388}} At the invite of Palestinian bishop [[Samir Kafity]], he undertook a [[Christmas]] pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where he gave a sermon at [[Shepherd's Field]] near [[Bethlehem]], in which he called for a [[two-state solution]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=384, 386}} On that trip, he also visited the [[Yad Vashem]] Holocaust memorial, where he laid a wreath and spoke to journalists on the importance of forgiveness.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=386\u2013387}} His calls to forgive those who perpetrated the Holocaust, coupled with his support for a Palestinian state, brought criticism from many Jewish groups across the world.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=387}} This was exacerbated by the fact that he sought to evade suspicions of [[anti-Semitism]] through comments such as \"my dentist is a Dr. Cohen\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=385}}\n\nTutu also spoke out regarding [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. At the Lambeth conference of 1988, he backed a resolution on the issue which condemned the use of violence by all sides; Tutu believed that, given Irish republicans had the right to vote, they had not exhausted peaceful means of bringing about change and thus should not resort to armed struggle.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} Three years later, he gave a televised service from [[Dublin]]'s [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] where he called for negotiations to take place between all factions, including the Irish republican [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], groups which Thatcher's UK government had refused to engage with.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} He visited [[Belfast]] in 1998 and again in 2001.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}}\n\n==Later life==\nIn October 1994, Tutu announced his intention to retire as archbishop in 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}} Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops bestowed on him a new title: \"archbishop emeritus\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} There, Mandela awarded Tutu the [[Order for Meritorious Service]], South Africa's highest honour.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} Tutu was succeeded as archbishop by Ndungane.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}}\n\nIn January 1997, Tutu was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and travelled abroad for treatment.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=153|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=370}} He publicly revealed his diagnosis, hoping to encourage other men to go for prostate exams.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=153}} He faced recurrences of the disease in 1999 and 2006.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=370}} Back in South Africa, he divided his time between homes in Soweto's Orlando West and Cape Town's [[Milnerton]] area.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In 2000, he opened an office in Cape Town.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In June 2000, the Cape Town-based Desmond Tutu Peace Centre was launched, which in 2003 launched an Emerging Leadership Program.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}}\n\nConscious that his presence in South Africa might overshadow Ndungane, Tutu agreed to a two-year [[visiting professor]]ship at Emory University.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} This took place between 1998 and 2000, and during the period he wrote a book about the TRC, ''No Future Without Forgiveness''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=162}} In early 2002 he taught at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} From January to May 2003 he taught at the [[University of North Carolina]].{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} In January 2004, he was visiting professor of postconflict societies at KCL, his ''alma mater''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} While in the United States, he signed up with a speakers' agency and travelled widely on speaking engagements; this gave him financial independence in a way that his clerical pension would not.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In his speeches, he focused on South Africa's transition from apartheid to universal suffrage, presenting it as a model for other troubled nations to adopt.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=161}} In the US, he thanked anti-apartheid activists for campaigning for sanctions, also calling for US companies to now invest in South Africa.{{sfn|Gish|2004|pp=161\u2013162}}\n\n===Truth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996\u20131998===\n\n[[File:Desmond Tutu 1997.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[Embassy of South Africa, Washington, D.C.]], in 1997]]\nTutu popularised the term \"[[Rainbow Nation]]\" as a metaphor for [[post-apartheid South Africa]] after 1994 under ANC rule.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=520}} He had first used the metaphor in 1989 when he described a multi-racial protest crowd as the \"rainbow people of God\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=391}} Tutu advocated what liberation theologians call \"critical solidarity\", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise his allies.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He criticised Mandela on several points, such as his tendency to wear brightly coloured [[Madiba shirt]]s, which he regarded as inappropriate; Mandela offered the tongue-in-cheek response that it was ironic coming from a man who wore dresses.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=345}} More serious was Tutu's criticism of Mandela's retention of South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected Members of Parliament adopted.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=143\u2013144|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=517}} Mandela hit back, calling Tutu a \"populist\" and stating that he should have raised these issues privately rather than publicly.{{sfnm|1a1=Allen|1y=2006|1p=345|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=517}}\n\nA key question facing the post-apartheid government was how they would respond to the various human rights abuses that had been committed over the previous decades by both the state and by anti-apartheid activists. The National Party had wanted a comprehensive amnesty package whereas the ANC wanted trials of former state figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=343\u2013344}} [[Alex Boraine]] helped Mandela's government to draw up legislation for the establishment of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), which was passed by parliament in July 1995.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=344\u2013345}} Nuttall suggested that Tutu become one of the TRC's seventeen commissioners, while in September a synod of bishops formally nominated him.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=147|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345}} Tutu proposed that the TRC adopt a threefold approach: the first being confession, with those responsible for human rights abuses fully disclosing their activities, the second being forgiveness in the form of a legal amnesty from prosecution, and the third being restitution, with the perpetrators making amends to their victims.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=344}}\n\nMandela named Tutu as the chair of the TRC, with Boraine as his deputy.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=147, 148|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=345\u2013346|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=529}} The commission was a significant undertaking, employing over 300 staff, dividing into three committees, and holding as many as four hearings simultaneously.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=346}} In the TRC, Tutu advocated \"restorative justice\", something which he considered characteristic of traditional African jurisprudence \"in the spirit of ''ubuntu''\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=347}} As head of the commission, Tutu had to deal with its various inter-personal problems, with much suspicion between those on its board who had been anti-apartheid activists and those who had supported the apartheid system.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=349}} He acknowledged that \"we really were like a bunch of prima donnas, frequently hypersensitive, often taking umbrage easily at real or imagined slights\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} Tutu opened meetings with prayers and often referred to Christian teachings when discussing the TRC's work, frustrating some who saw him as incorporating too many religious elements into an expressly secular body.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}}\n\nThe first hearing took place in April 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} The hearings were publicly televised and had a considerable impact on South African society.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=350}} He had very little control over the committee responsible for granting amnesty, instead chairing the committee which heard accounts of human rights abuses perpetrated by both anti-apartheid and apartheid figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=348}} While listening to the testimony of victims, Tutu was sometimes overwhelmed by emotion and cried during the hearings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=352}} He singled out those victims who expressed forgiveness towards those who had harmed them and used these individuals as his leitmotif.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=351}} The ANC's image was tarnished by the revelations that some of its activists had engaged in torture, attacks on civilians, and other human rights abuses. It sought to suppress part of the final TRC report, infuriating Tutu.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=157|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=366\u2013367|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=531\u2013532}} He warned of the ANC's \"abuse of power\", stating that \"yesterday's oppressed can quite easily become today's oppressors... We've seen it happen all over the world and we shouldn't be surprised if it happens here\".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=532}} Tutu presented the five-volume TRC report to Mandela in a public ceremony in Pretoria in October 1998.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=157}} Ultimately, Tutu was pleased with the TRC's achievement, believing that it would aid long-term reconciliation, although recognised its short-comings.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=158}}\n\n===Social and international issues: 1999\u20132009===\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = I would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven.

She has nurtured the deepest things in us blacks.\"{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=115}}\n\nHe became, according to Du Boulay, \"one of the most eloquent and persuasive communicators\" of black theology.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}} He expressed his views on theology largely through sermons and addresses rather than in extended academic treatises.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}}\nTutu expressed the view that Western theology sought answers to questions that Africans were not asking.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=135\u2013136}} For Tutu, two major questions were being posed by African Christianity: how to replace imported Christian expressions of faith with something authentically African, and how to liberate people from bondage.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=136}} He believed that there were many comparisons to be made between contemporary African understandings of God and those featured in the Old Testament.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=137}} He nevertheless criticised African theology for failing to sufficiently address contemporary societal problems, and suggested that to correct this it should learn from the black theology tradition.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=116}}\n\nWhen chairing the TRC, Tutu advocated an explicitly Christian model of reconciliation, as part of which he believed that South Africans had to face up to the damages that they had caused and accept the consequences of their actions.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} As part of this, he believed that the perpetrators and beneficiaries of apartheid must admit to their actions but that the system's victims should respond generously, stating that it was a \"gospel imperative\" to forgive.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} At the same time, he argued that those responsible had to display true repentance in the form of restitution.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\n[[File:Desmond tutu 20070607 2.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]], 2007]]\n\nGish noted that by the time of apartheid's fall, Tutu had attained \"worldwide respect\" for his \"uncompromising stand for justice and reconciliation and his unmatched integrity\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=148}} According to Allen, Tutu \"made a powerful and unique contribution to publicizing the antiapartheid struggle abroad\", particularly in the United States.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=233}} In the latter country, he was able to rise to prominence as a South African anti-apartheid activist because\u2014unlike Mandela and other members of the ANC\u2014he had no links to the South African Communist Party and thus was more acceptable to Americans amid the Cold War anti-communist sentiment of the period.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=253}} In the U.S., he was often compared to Martin Luther King, with the African-American civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]] referring to him as \"the Martin Luther King of South Africa\"; this was a comparison that Tutu was embarrassed by.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=198}}\nAfter the end of apartheid, Tutu became \"perhaps the world's most prominent religious leader advocating gay and lesbian rights\", according to Allen.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=372}} Ultimately, Allen thought that perhaps Tutu's \"greatest legacy\" was the fact that he gave \"to the world as it entered the twenty-first century an African model for expressing the nature of human community\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=396}}\n\nDuring Tutu's rise to notability during the 1970s and 1980s, responses to him were \"sharply polarized\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} Noting that he was \"simultaneously loved and hated, honoured and vilified\",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=170}} Du Boulay attributed his divisive reception to the fact that \"strong people evoke strong emotions\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}} Tutu gained much adulation from black journalists, inspired imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, and led to many black parents naming their children after him.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} For many black South Africans, he was a respected religious leader and a symbol of black achievement.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=247}} By 1984 he was\u2014according to Gish\u2014\"the personification of the South African freedom struggle\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=103}} In 1988, Du Boulay described him as \"a spokesman for his people, a voice for the voiceless\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}}\n\nThe response he received from South Africa's white minority was more mixed. Most of those who criticised him were conservative whites who did not want a shift away from apartheid and white-minority rule.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=138|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=78}} Many of these whites were angered that he was calling for economic sanctions against South Africa and that he was warning that racial violence was impending.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=98}} Said whites often accused him of being a tool of the communists.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} This hostility was exacerbated by the government's campaign to discredit Tutu and distort his image,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=97}} which included repeatedly misquoting him to present his statements out of context.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=263}} According to Du Boulay, the SABC and much of the white press went to \"extraordinary attempts to discredit him\", something that \"made it hard to know the man himself\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} Allen noted that in 1984, Tutu was \"the black leader white South Africans most loved to hate\" and that this antipathy extended beyond supporters of the far-right government to liberals too.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=202}} The fact that he was \"an object of hate\" for many was something that deeply pained him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Hated by many white South Africans for being too radical, he was also scorned by many black militants for being too moderate.\n| source=\u2014 On Tutu in the mid-1980s, by Steven D.

1931) is a South African [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cleric and [[theologian]] known for his work as an [[anti-apartheid movement|anti-apartheid]] and [[human rights]] activist. He was the [[Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg|Bishop of Johannesburg]] from 1985 to 1986 and then the [[Archbishop of Cape Town]] from 1986 to 1996, in both cases being the first black African to hold the position. Theologically, he sought to fuse ideas from [[black theology]] with [[African theology]]; politically, he identifies as a [[socialist]].\n\nTutu was born of mixed [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Motswana]] heritage to a poor family in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Union of South Africa]]. Entering adulthood, he trained as a teacher and married [[Nomalizo Leah Tutu]], with whom he had several children. In 1960, he was ordained as an Anglican priest and in 1962 moved to the United Kingdom to study theology at [[King's College London]]. In 1966 he returned to southern Africa, teaching at the [[Federal Theological Seminary of Southern Africa|Federal Theological Seminary]] and then the [[University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland]]. In 1972, he became the Theological Education Fund's director for Africa, a position based in [[London]] but necessitating regular tours of the African continent. Back in southern Africa in 1975, he served first as [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Johannesburg]] and then as [[Bishop of Lesotho]], taking an active role in opposition to South Africa's [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[White South African|white-minority]] rule. From 1978 to 1985 he was general-secretary of the [[South African Council of Churches]], emerging as one of South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid activists. Although warning the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government that anger at apartheid would lead to racial violence, as an activist he stressed [[non-violent protest]] and foreign economic pressure to bring about [[universal suffrage]].\n\nIn 1985, Tutu became Bishop of Johannesburg and in 1986 the Archbishop of Cape Town, the most senior position in southern Africa's Anglican hierarchy. In this position he emphasised a consensus-building model of leadership and oversaw the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|introduction of women priests]]. Also in 1986, he became president of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]], resulting in further tours of the continent. After President [[F. W. de Klerk]] released the anti-apartheid activist [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison in 1990 and the pair led negotiations to end apartheid and introduce multi-racial democracy, Tutu assisted as a mediator between rival black factions. After the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]] resulted in a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|coalition government]] headed by Mandela, the latter selected Tutu to chair the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past human rights abuses committed by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. Since apartheid's fall, Tutu has campaigned for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]] and spoken out on a wide range of subjects, among them the [[Israel-Palestine conflict]], his opposition to the [[Iraq War]], and his criticism of South African Presidents [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Jacob Zuma]]. In 2010, he retired from public life.\n\nTutu polarised opinion as he rose to notability in the 1970s. White conservatives who supported apartheid despised him, while many white [[liberalism|liberals]] regarded him as too radical; many black radicals accused him of being too moderate and focused on cultivating white goodwill, while [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninists]] criticised his [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance. He was widely popular among South Africa's black majority, and was internationally praised for his anti-apartheid activism, receiving a range of awards, including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. He has also compiled several books of his speeches and sermons.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: 1931\u20131950===\n\nDesmond Mpilo Tutu was born on 7 October 1931 in [[Klerksdorp]], a city in [[North West (South African province)|northwest South Africa]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=2|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=9\u201310}} His mother, Allen Dorothea Mavoertsek Mathlare, was born to a [[Tswana people|Motswana]] family in [[Boksburg]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=10}} His father, Zachariah Zelilo Tutu, was from the [[Fengu people|amaFengu]] branch of [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and had grown up in [[Gcuwa]], [[Eastern Cape]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=10\u201311}} At home, the couple both spoke the [[Xhosa language]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=11}} Zachariah trained as a primary school teacher at [[Lovedale (South Africa)|Lovedale]] college before taking a post in Boksburg, where he married his wife.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=14}} In the late 1920s, he took a job in Klerksdorp; in the [[Afrikaaner]]-founded city, he and his wife resided in the black residential area. Established in 1907, it was then known as the \"native location\" although was later renamed Makoetend.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=14\u201315}} The native location housed a diverse community; although most residents were [[Tswana people|Tswana]], it also housed Xhosa, [[Sotho people|Sotho]], and a few Indian traders.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=16}} Zachariah worked as the principal of a [[Methodism|Methodist]] primary school and the family lived in the schoolmaster's house, a small mud-brick building in the yard of the Methodist mission.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=16}}\n\n[[File:ChurchofChristtheKing.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Church of Christ the King|The Church of Christ the King in Sophiatown, where Tutu was a server under priest Trevor Huddlestone]]\n\nThe Tutus were poor;{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=28|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3}} describing his family, Tutu later related that \"although we weren't affluent, we were not destitute either\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} Tutu had an older sister, Sylvia Funeka, who called him \"Mpilo\" (\"life\"), a name given to him by his paternal grandmother.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=22, 29|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=19}} The rest of the family called him \"Boy\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=19}} He was his parent's second son; their firstborn boy, Sipho, had died in infancy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=19}} Another daughter, Gloria Lindiwe, would be born after him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=22}} Tutu was sickly from birth;{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=2|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=19}} [[polio]] resulted in the atrophy of his right hand,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=32|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=19}} and on one occasion he was hospitalised with serious burns.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=20}} Tutu had a close relationship with his father, although was angered at the latter's heavy drinking, during which he would sometimes beat his wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=22}} The family were initially Methodists and Tutu was [[baptism|baptised]] into the [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa|Methodist Church]] in June 1932.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=30|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=33}} They subsequently changed denominations, first to the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] and then to the [[Anglican Church]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=30\u201331|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=33}}\n\nIn 1936, the family moved to [[Tshing]], where Zachariah was employed as the principal of a Methodist school; they lived in a hut in the school yard.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=20}} There, Tutu started his primary education and played football with the other children,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} also becoming the server at St Francis Anglican Church.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=33}} He developed a love of reading, particularly enjoying comic books and European [[fairy tales]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=30|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} Here, he also learned [[Afrikaans]], the main language of the area.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=23|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} It was in Tshing that his parents had a third son, Tamsanqa, who also died in infancy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} Around 1941, Tutu's mother moved to [[Witwatersrand]] to work as a cook at Ezenzeleni, an institute for the blind in western Johannesburg. Tutu joined her in the city, first living with an aunt in [[Roodepoort|Roodepoort West]] before they secured their own house in the township.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=5|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=24}} In Johannesburg, he attended a Methodist primary school before transferring to the [[Swedish Boarding School]] (SBS) in the [[St. Martin's School (Rosettenville)|St Agnes Mission]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=24}} Several months later, he moved with his father to [[Ermelo]], eastern Transvaal.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=25}} After six months, the duo returned to live with the rest of the family in Roodepoort West, where Tutu resuming his studies at SBS.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=25}} He had pursued his interest in [[Christianity]] and at the age of 12 underwent [[confirmation]] at St Mary's Church, Roodepoort.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=34}}\n\nTutu failed the arithmetic component of his primary school exam, but despite this, his father secured him entry to the Johannesburg Bantu High School in 1945, where he excelled academically.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=25, 34\u201335}} There, he joined a school [[rugby union|rugby]] team, developing a lifelong love of the sport.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=36}} Outside of school, he earned money selling oranges and as a [[caddie]] for white [[golf]]ers.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=27|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=7|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=37}} To avoid the expense of a daily train commute to school, he briefly lived with family nearer to Johannesburg, before moving back in with his parents when they relocated to [[Munsieville]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=36, 37\u201338}} He then returned to Johannesburg by moving into a hostel that was part of the Anglican complex surrounding the Church of Christ the King in [[Sophiatown]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=29|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=8|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=42}} He became a server at the church and came under the influence of its priest, [[Trevor Huddleston]];{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=10|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=43\u201345}} later biographer [[Shirley du Boulay]] suggested that Huddleston was \"the greatest single influence\" in Tutu's life.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=31}} In 1947, Tutu contracted [[tuberculosis]] and was hospitalised in [[Rietfontein]] for 18 months, during which he spent much of his time reading and was regularly visited by Huddleston.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=29\u201330|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=9|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=45\u201346}} In the hospital, he underwent a [[circumcision]] to mark his transition to manhood.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=47}} He returned to school in 1949 and took his national exams in late 1950, gaining a second-class pass.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n===College and teaching career: 1951\u20131955===\n\nWanting to become a doctor, Desmond Tutu secured admission to study medicine at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]; however, his parents could not afford the tuition fees.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=47\u201348}} Instead, he turned toward teaching, gaining a government scholarship to start a course at Pretoria Bantu Normal College, a teacher training institution, in 1951.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=12|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=48}} There, he served as treasurer of the Student Representative Council, helped to organise the Literacy and Dramatic Society, and chaired the Cultural and Debating Society for two years.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=48}} It was during one local debating event that he first met the lawyer\u2014and future president of South Africa\u2014[[Nelson Mandela]]; the latter did not remember the meeting and they would not encounter each other again until 1990.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=17|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=48\u201349}} At the college, Tutu attained his Transvaal Bantu Teachers Diploma, having gained advice about taking exams from the activist [[Robert Sobukwe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=50}} He had also taken five correspondence courses provided by the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA), graduating in the same class as future Zimbabwean leader [[Robert Mugabe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=49\u201350}}\n\nIn 1954, he began teaching English at Madibane High School; the following year, he transferred to the [[Krugersdorp High School]], where he taught English and history.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=17, 18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=50\u201351}} He began courting Nomalizo Leah Shenxane, a friend of his sister Gloria who was studying to become a primary school teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=18|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=51}} They were legally married at Krugersdorp Native Commissioner's Court in June 1955, before undergoing a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] wedding ceremony at the Church of Mary Queen of Apostles; although he was an Anglican, Tutu had agreed to the ceremony due to Leah's Roman Catholic faith.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=38|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=51\u201352}} The newly married couple initially lived in a room at Tutu's parental home before renting their own home six months later.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=52}} Their first child, Trevor, was born in April 1956;{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=53}} their first daughter, Thandeka, appeared 16 months later.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=53}} The couple worshipped at St Paul's Church, where Tutu volunteered as a [[Sunday school]] teacher, assistant choirmaster, church councillor, lay preacher, and sub-deacon,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=53}} while outside of the church he also volunteered as a football administrator for a local team.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=52}}\n\n===Joining the clergy: 1956\u20131966===\n\n[[File:St Albans, Golders Green-2.jpg|thumb|right|Tutu first ministered to a white congregation at the Church of St Alban the Martyr in Golders Green, living with his family in the curate's flat]]\n\nIn 1953, the white-minority [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government had introduced the [[Bantu Education Act, 1953|Bantu Education Act]] as a means of furthering their [[apartheid]] system of racial segregation and white domination; both Tutu and his wife disliked these changes and decided to leave the teaching profession.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=41\u201345|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=20\u201321|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=60\u201361}} With Huddleston's support, Tutu left the teaching profession to become an Anglican priest.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=23|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=61}} In January 1956, his request to join the [[Ordinands Guild]] was turned down due to the debts he had accrued;

At the Lambeth conference of 1988, he backed a resolution on the issue which condemned the use of violence by all sides; Tutu believed that, given Irish republicans had the right to vote, they had not exhausted peaceful means of bringing about change and thus should not resort to armed struggle.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} Three years later, he gave a televised service from [[Dublin]]'s [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] where he called for negotiations to take place between all factions, including the Irish republican [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], groups which Thatcher's UK government had refused to engage with.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} He visited [[Belfast]] in 1998 and again in 2001.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}}\n\n==Later life==\nIn October 1994, Tutu announced his intention to retire as archbishop in 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}} Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops bestowed on him a new title: \"archbishop emeritus\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} There, Mandela awarded Tutu the [[Order for Meritorious Service]], South Africa's highest honour.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} Tutu was succeeded as archbishop by Ndungane.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}}\n\nIn January 1997, Tutu was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and travelled abroad for treatment.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=153|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=370}} He publicly revealed his diagnosis, hoping to encourage other men to go for prostate exams.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=153}} He faced recurrences of the disease in 1999 and 2006.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=370}} Back in South Africa, he divided his time between homes in Soweto's Orlando West and Cape Town's [[Milnerton]] area.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In 2000, he opened an office in Cape Town.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In June 2000, the Cape Town-based Desmond Tutu Peace Centre was launched, which in 2003 launched an Emerging Leadership Program.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}}\n\nConscious that his presence in South Africa might overshadow Ndungane, Tutu agreed to a two-year [[visiting professor]]ship at Emory University.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} This took place between 1998 and 2000, and during the period he wrote a book about the TRC, ''No Future Without Forgiveness''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=162}} In early 2002 he taught at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} From January to May 2003 he taught at the [[University of North Carolina]].{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} In January 2004, he was visiting professor of postconflict societies at KCL, his ''alma mater''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} While in the United States, he signed up with a speakers' agency and travelled widely on speaking engagements; this gave him financial independence in a way that his clerical pension would not.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In his speeches, he focused on South Africa's transition from apartheid to universal suffrage, presenting it as a model for other troubled nations to adopt.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=161}} In the US, he thanked anti-apartheid activists for campaigning for sanctions, also calling for US companies to now invest in South Africa.{{sfn|Gish|2004|pp=161\u2013162}}\n\n===Truth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996\u20131998===\n\n[[File:Desmond Tutu 1997.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[Embassy of South Africa, Washington, D.C.]], in 1997]]\nTutu popularised the term \"[[Rainbow Nation]]\" as a metaphor for [[post-apartheid South Africa]] after 1994 under ANC rule.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=520}} He had first used the metaphor in 1989 when he described a multi-racial protest crowd as the \"rainbow people of God\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=391}} Tutu advocated what liberation theologians call \"critical solidarity\", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise his allies.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He criticised Mandela on several points, such as his tendency to wear brightly coloured [[Madiba shirt]]s, which he regarded as inappropriate; Mandela offered the tongue-in-cheek response that it was ironic coming from a man who wore dresses.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=345}} More serious was Tutu's criticism of Mandela's retention of South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected Members of Parliament adopted.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=143\u2013144|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=517}} Mandela hit back, calling Tutu a \"populist\" and stating that he should have raised these issues privately rather than publicly.{{sfnm|1a1=Allen|1y=2006|1p=345|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=517}}\n\nA key question facing the post-apartheid government was how they would respond to the various human rights abuses that had been committed over the previous decades by both the state and by anti-apartheid activists. The National Party had wanted a comprehensive amnesty package whereas the ANC wanted trials of former state figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=343\u2013344}} [[Alex Boraine]] helped Mandela's government to draw up legislation for the establishment of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), which was passed by parliament in July 1995.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=344\u2013345}} Nuttall suggested that Tutu become one of the TRC's seventeen commissioners, while in September a synod of bishops formally nominated him.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=147|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345}} Tutu proposed that the TRC adopt a threefold approach: the first being confession, with those responsible for human rights abuses fully disclosing their activities, the second being forgiveness in the form of a legal amnesty from prosecution, and the third being restitution, with the perpetrators making amends to their victims.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=344}}\n\nMandela named Tutu as the chair of the TRC, with Boraine as his deputy.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=147, 148|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=345\u2013346|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=529}} The commission was a significant undertaking, employing over 300 staff, dividing into three committees, and holding as many as four hearings simultaneously.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=346}} In the TRC, Tutu advocated \"restorative justice\", something which he considered characteristic of traditional African jurisprudence \"in the spirit of ''ubuntu''\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=347}} As head of the commission, Tutu had to deal with its various inter-personal problems, with much suspicion between those on its board who had been anti-apartheid activists and those who had supported the apartheid system.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=349}} He acknowledged that \"we really were like a bunch of prima donnas, frequently hypersensitive, often taking umbrage easily at real or imagined slights\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} Tutu opened meetings with prayers and often referred to Christian teachings when discussing the TRC's work, frustrating some who saw him as incorporating too many religious elements into an expressly secular body.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}}\n\nThe first hearing took place in April 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} The hearings were publicly televised and had a considerable impact on South African society.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=350}} He had very little control over the committee responsible for granting amnesty, instead chairing the committee which heard accounts of human rights abuses perpetrated by both anti-apartheid and apartheid figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=348}} While listening to the testimony of victims, Tutu was sometimes overwhelmed by emotion and cried during the hearings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=352}} He singled out those victims who expressed forgiveness towards those who had harmed them and used these individuals as his leitmotif.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=351}} The ANC's image was tarnished by the revelations that some of its activists had engaged in torture, attacks on civilians, and other human rights abuses. It sought to suppress part of the final TRC report, infuriating Tutu.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=157|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=366\u2013367|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=531\u2013532}} He warned of the ANC's \"abuse of power\", stating that \"yesterday's oppressed can quite easily become today's oppressors...

He noted that whereas the latter was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, the National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where they lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=212}} In his words, \"Apartheid is as evil and as vicious as Nazism and Communism\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=84}}\n\nTutu never became anti-white, in part due to his many positive experiences with white people.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=129}} In his speeches, he stressed that it was apartheid\u2014rather than white people\u2014that was the enemy.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=68}} He promoted racial reconciliation between South Africa's communities, believing that most blacks fundamentally wanted to live in harmony with whites,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=80}} although he stressed that reconciliation would only be possible among equals, after blacks had been given full civil rights.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=100}} He tried to cultivate goodwill from the country's white community, making a point of showing white individuals gratitude when they made concessions to black demands.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=80}} He also spoke to many white audiences, urging them to support his cause, referring to it as the \"winning side\",{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=161|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=81}} and reminding them that when apartheid had been overthrown, black South Africans would remember who their friends had been.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=186}} When he held public prayers, he always included mention of those who upheld apartheid, such as politicians and police, alongside the system's victims, emphasising his view that all humans were the children of God.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=74}} He stated that \"the people who are perpetrators of injury in our land are not sporting horns or tails.

She has nurtured the deepest things in us blacks.\"{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=115}}\n\nHe became, according to Du Boulay, \"one of the most eloquent and persuasive communicators\" of black theology.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}} He expressed his views on theology largely through sermons and addresses rather than in extended academic treatises.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}}\nTutu expressed the view that Western theology sought answers to questions that Africans were not asking.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=135\u2013136}} For Tutu, two major questions were being posed by African Christianity: how to replace imported Christian expressions of faith with something authentically African, and how to liberate people from bondage.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=136}} He believed that there were many comparisons to be made between contemporary African understandings of God and those featured in the Old Testament.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=137}} He nevertheless criticised African theology for failing to sufficiently address contemporary societal problems, and suggested that to correct this it should learn from the black theology tradition.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=116}}\n\nWhen chairing the TRC, Tutu advocated an explicitly Christian model of reconciliation, as part of which he believed that South Africans had to face up to the damages that they had caused and accept the consequences of their actions.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} As part of this, he believed that the perpetrators and beneficiaries of apartheid must admit to their actions but that the system's victims should respond generously, stating that it was a \"gospel imperative\" to forgive.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} At the same time, he argued that those responsible had to display true repentance in the form of restitution.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\n[[File:Desmond tutu 20070607 2.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]], 2007]]\n\nGish noted that by the time of apartheid's fall, Tutu had attained \"worldwide respect\" for his \"uncompromising stand for justice and reconciliation and his unmatched integrity\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=148}} According to Allen, Tutu \"made a powerful and unique contribution to publicizing the antiapartheid struggle abroad\", particularly in the United States.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=233}} In the latter country, he was able to rise to prominence as a South African anti-apartheid activist because\u2014unlike Mandela and other members of the ANC\u2014he had no links to the South African Communist Party and thus was more acceptable to Americans amid the Cold War anti-communist sentiment of the period.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=253}} In the U.S., he was often compared to Martin Luther King, with the African-American civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]] referring to him as \"the Martin Luther King of South Africa\"; this was a comparison that Tutu was embarrassed by.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=198}}\nAfter the end of apartheid, Tutu became \"perhaps the world's most prominent religious leader advocating gay and lesbian rights\", according to Allen.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=372}} Ultimately, Allen thought that perhaps Tutu's \"greatest legacy\" was the fact that he gave \"to the world as it entered the twenty-first century an African model for expressing the nature of human community\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=396}}\n\nDuring Tutu's rise to notability during the 1970s and 1980s, responses to him were \"sharply polarized\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} Noting that he was \"simultaneously loved and hated, honoured and vilified\",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=170}} Du Boulay attributed his divisive reception to the fact that \"strong people evoke strong emotions\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}} Tutu gained much adulation from black journalists, inspired imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, and led to many black parents naming their children after him.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} For many black South Africans, he was a respected religious leader and a symbol of black achievement.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=247}} By 1984 he was\u2014according to Gish\u2014\"the personification of the South African freedom struggle\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=103}} In 1988, Du Boulay described him as \"a spokesman for his people, a voice for the voiceless\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}}\n\nThe response he received from South Africa's white minority was more mixed. Most of those who criticised him were conservative whites who did not want a shift away from apartheid and white-minority rule.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=138|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=78}} Many of these whites were angered that he was calling for economic sanctions against South Africa and that he was warning that racial violence was impending.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=98}} Said whites often accused him of being a tool of the communists.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} This hostility was exacerbated by the government's campaign to discredit Tutu and distort his image,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=97}} which included repeatedly misquoting him to present his statements out of context.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=263}} According to Du Boulay, the SABC and much of the white press went to \"extraordinary attempts to discredit him\", something that \"made it hard to know the man himself\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} Allen noted that in 1984, Tutu was \"the black leader white South Africans most loved to hate\" and that this antipathy extended beyond supporters of the far-right government to liberals too.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=202}} The fact that he was \"an object of hate\" for many was something that deeply pained him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Hated by many white South Africans for being too radical, he was also scorned by many black militants for being too moderate.\n| source=\u2014 On Tutu in the mid-1980s, by Steven D.
