A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009, with a direct train to London that terminates at Corby, with a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}.

Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[South Staffordshire Line]] between Stourbridge and Walsall is set to reopen as a part of the Midland Metro expansion scheme. The line will be shared between trams and freight trains.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].

Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Auchinleck}}, {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track. The line was doubled, electrified and extended beyond Bathgate to Airdrie in 2010, creating a fourth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n* A 35-mile (56&nbsp;km) stretch of the former [[Waverley Route]] between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and {{Stnlnk|Tweedbank}} via Galashiels [[Borders Railway|reopened]] on 6 September 2015. The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between

This update features new front-end styling and tail lamps.

There is also a new engine and the interior has also been revised.<ref>[http://www.thetorquereport.com/2008/03/2009_kia_optima_debuts_in_new.html Redesigned 2009 Kia Optima Debuts in New York] 20 March 2008, The Torque Report</ref> Main changes in the interior are a redesigned instrument cluster and a [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]/AM/FM/MP3/CD with an auxiliary jack. In certain markets, the option of satellite navigation is offered.\n\nThe new ''[[Hyundai Theta engine|Theta II]]'' 2.4-liter I4 employs dual continuously [[variable valve timing]] (CVVT) and a variable intake system (VIS) to increase power to {{convert|131|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, while returning improved fuel consumption over its predecessor. Torque is rated at {{convert|229|Nm|abbr=on}}. There is a 2.0L I4 for other markets with either a 5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic transmission. Power is rated at {{Convert|164|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6200 RPM and {{Convert|197|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|abbr=on}} of torque. Acceleration for the 2.0L is {{convert|0|-|100|km/h|abbr=on}} in 9.2 seconds for the 5 speed manual and 10.1 seconds for the 4 speed automatic. Top speed rated up to {{Convert|208|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} outside of the US. The 2.7-liter [[V6]] offers few changes to the previous model, though power is increased to {{convert|144|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, and torque to {{convert|249|Nm|abbr=on}}. Acceleration for the 5-speed automatic takes it from {{Convert|0|-|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 8.9sec with a top speed up to {{Convert|220|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. A five-speed manual transmission is standard in the base model, and a five-speed automatic is included with mid- and high-end levels (or as an option in the base model).\n\n2010 models see the addition of a [[Electronic key|Proximity Key]] with Push-Button Start and paddle shifters on SX models.\n\nIn Australia, the Magentis was introduced in August 2006, and replaced the Optima. Initially available with a choice of 2.4&nbsp;L 4-cylinder or 2.7&nbsp;L V6 engines, the Magentis' sales never caught on, with sales peaking at only 741 units in 2007. In 2008, the V6 engine was dropped, as was the EX-L model, leaving only the entry-level 2.4&nbsp;L EX on sale until its discontinuation in 2009. While the facelifted 2010 model was never officially launched, a very small number were imported for \"evaluation\" purposes, and eventually sold to the public as demos.\n\n====U.S. engines====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Type!!Model Years!!Power@rpm!!Torque@rpm\n|-\n|{{convert|2359|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 2.4&nbsp;L [[Hyundai Theta engine|''Theta II'']] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] || 2006.5\u20132008 || {{convert|162|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5800 || {{convert|164|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000\n|-\n|{{convert|2359|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 2.4&nbsp;L [[Hyundai Theta engine|''Theta II'']] I4||2009\u20132010|| {{convert|175|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6000|| {{convert|169|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000\n|-\n|{{convert|2656|cc|cuin||abbr=on}}  2.7&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai Engine|Delta]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||2006|| {{convert|170|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6000|| {{convert|181|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{convert|2657|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 2.7&nbsp;L [[Hyundai Mu engine|''Mu'']] V6||2006.5-2008|| {{convert|185|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6000|| {{convert|182|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000\n|-\n|2009\u20132010|| {{convert|194|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6000|| {{convert|184|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4500\n|-\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|TF/QF}}Third generation (2010\u20132015)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name          = Third generation (TF)\n| image         = 2011 Kia Optima SX -- 08-26-2011.jpg\n| caption       =\n| aka           = {{Plainlist|\n*Kia K5 (South Korea, China)\n*Kia Optima K5 (Malaysia)\n}}\n| production    = 2010\u20132015\n| assembly      = {{Plainlist|\n*South Korea: [[Hwaseong, Gyeonggi|Hwaseong]] ([[List of Kia design and manufacturing facilities#Hwaseong Plant|Hwaseong Plant]])\n*China: [[Yancheng]] ([[List of Kia design and manufacturing facilities#Yancheng Plant|Yancheng Plant]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n*Kazakhstan: [[Oskemen]] (Azia Avto)\n*Russia: [[Kaliningrad]] ([[Avtotor]])\n*United States: [[West Point, Georgia|West Point, GA]] ([[List of Kia design and manufacturing facilities#Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia (KMMG)|KMMG]])<ref>{{cite web|author= Chris Shunk RSS feed |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/04/22/kia-adding-optima-production-line-to-georgia-plant/ |title=Kia adding optima production line to georgia plant |publisher=Autoblog.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n| designer      = {{Plainlist|\n*[[Peter Schreyer]]\n*[[Mikl\u00f3s Kov\u00e1cs (automobile designer)|Mikl\u00f3s Kov\u00e1cs]]\n*Davide Limongelli\n}}\n| body_style    = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| platform      =\n| related       = [[Hyundai Sonata]] (YF)\n| engine        = {{Plainlist|\n*2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai Theta engine|Theta II]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] ([[Petrol engine|gasoline]])\n*2.0&nbsp;L ''Theta II'' [[Gasoline direct injection|GDI]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] I4 (gasoline)\n*2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai Nu engine|Nu]]'' [[Continuous variable valve timing|''CVVL'']] I4 (gasoline)\n*2.4&nbsp;L ''Theta II'' I4 (gasoline)\n*2.4&nbsp;L ''Theta II'' GDI I4 (gasoline)\n*1.7&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai U engine|U2]]'' [[Common rail|CRDi]] [[Turbodiesel|TD]] I4 ([[Diesel engine|diesel]])\n*2.0&nbsp;L ''D4EA'' CRDi TD I4 (diesel)\n}}\n| transmission  = {{Plainlist|\n*6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n*6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n}}\n| wheelbase     = {{convert|2795|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| length        = {{convert|4845|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| width         = {{convert|1835|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| height        = {{convert|1455|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| weight        = {{convert|1391|-|1411|kg|lb|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|1535|kg|lb|abbr=on}} <small>(Turbo)</small><br />{{convert|1583|kg|lb|abbr=on}} <small>(Hybrid)</small>\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 2012 Kia Optima (TF) Si sedan (2015-12-24) 02.jpg\n| caption1 = Kia Optima Si (Australia; pre-facelift)\n| image2 = Kia optima interior.jpg\n| caption2 = Interior\n}}\n\nThe completely redesigned Optima, sharing the same platform as its sibling [[Hyundai i40]], named the '''Kia K5''' in the South Korean and China market, made its world debut at the 2010 [[New York Auto Show]]. It features a much sleeker, sportier profile designed by new Kia design chief [[Peter Schreyer]], following the new design language featured on the [[Kia Forte]], [[Kia Sorento]], and upcoming [[Kia Sportage]] and [[Kia Cadenza]] \u2014 and using Kia's new corporate grille, known as the [[Kia Motors#Design emphasis|Tiger Nose]], also designed by Schreyer. Lead designer of the TF in the team of Peter Schreyer and Miklos Kovacs was the Italian Davide Limongelli. For the first time, this model will be using the Optima name worldwide, where the Magentis name had been used previously.\n\nAs with its [[Hyundai Sonata]] sibling, the Optima's lineup has been replaced with a universal GDI 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, either mated to a 6-speed [[automatic transmission]] with Eco dash display, or to a 6-speed [[manual transmission]] that is only standard on the LX model.  Sales began in fall 2010. The new K5 was released in the South Korean market on 29 April 2010.\n\nThe new Optima retains its trim lines of the base LX, upscale EX, and sporty SX models. Standard equipment includes safety features such as [[electronic stability control]] (ESC) and [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] brakes, as well as Sirius Satellite Radio, cooled glove box, [[iPod]] connectivity, and handsfree [[Bluetooth]] phone operation.  Starting in October 2013, on LX models, Kia will offer the [[Kia UVO|UVO]] infotainment system by [[Microsoft]] as part of the convenience package.  EX model options include Kia's new [[Kia UVO|UVO]] infotainment system by [[Microsoft]], integrated backup camera, and [[Electronic key|Proximity Key]] with Push-Button Start. A panoramic moonroof, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats and a navigation system are also available. SX models add a rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]], metal pedals, black hybrid metal and carbon insert trim, paddle shifters, and illuminated scuff plates.\n\nA Hybrid model and a Turbo model were also released. In addition, a wagon version was planned for European markets, and two-door coup\u00e9 version was mooted for the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/248826/ |title=Kia to launch Magentis estate |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=19 April 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> The turbo model will have the same powertrain as the Hyundai Sonata 2.0T.<ref name=\"kiaturbo.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kiaturbo.com |title=Optima Turbo |publisher=Kiaturbo.com.com|accessdate=2 August 2011}}</ref> The turbocharged model will have {{Convert|274|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|269|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque in the North American model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turbosonata.com/rumors-news-f1/specs-t2.htm |title=Specs |publisher=Turbosonata.com |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref> The car is estimated to obtain {{convert|34|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} on the highway.<ref name=\"kia.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kia.com/#/optima/specifications/|title=Specifications|accessdate=6 January 2011|work=kia.com}}</ref>\n\nThe third generation Kia Optima is built and manufactured in [[West Point, Georgia]], which began in 2011 with the 2012 model.\n\nIn Australia, the new Optima went on sale in January 2011.

The new K5 was released in the South Korean market on 15 July 2015.\n\nFor the Malaysian market, the fourth generation Kia Optima was launched in May 2017 powered by the Theta II 2.0 liter turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline engine with a 6-speed automatic transmission.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://paultan.org/2017/05/24/kia-optima-gt-launched-in-malaysia-242-hp-rm180k/|title=Kia Optima GT launched in Malaysia - 242 hp, RM180k|date=24 May 2017|work=Paul Tan's Automotive News|access-date=6 May 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Safety===\nThe 2017 Optima received a \"Top Safety Pick+\" rating from the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/kia/optima-4-door-sedan |title=2017 Kia Optima |publisher=[[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] |accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Test'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Rating'''\n|-\n|Overall:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{rating|5|5}}\n|-\n|Small overlap front:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Good\n|-\n|Moderate overlap front:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Good\n|-\n|Side:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Good\n|-\n|Roof strength:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Good\n|-\n|Head restraints & seats:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Good\n|-\n|Front crash prevention:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Superior\n|-\n|Headlights:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Good\n|-\n|Child seat anchors (Latch) ease of use:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Acceptable\n|}\n\n===Engines===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Type!!Model Years!!Power@rpm!!Torque@rpm\n|-\n|{{convert|1591|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai Gamma engine|G4FJ]]'' [[Turbocharger|turbo]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] || 2016-present || {{convert|178|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5500 || {{convert|195|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 1500\n|-\n|{{convert|2359|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 2.4&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai Theta engine|''Theta II'']]'' I4|| 2016-present || {{convert|185|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6000|| {{convert|178|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000\n|-\n|{{convert|1998|cc|cuin||abbr=on}}  2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai Theta engine|Theta]]'' turbo I4 || 2016-present || {{convert|245|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6000|| {{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 1350\n|-\n|{{convert|1685|cc|cuin||abbr=on}}  1.7CRDi&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai U2 engine|U2]]'' turbo I4 || 2015-present || {{convert|139|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000|| {{convert|251|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2000-2500\n|}\n\n===Plug-in hybrid===\n[[File:2019 Kia Optima PHEV Automatic Estate 2.0.jpg|left|thumb|Kia Optima plug-in hybrid]]\nA [[plug-in hybrid]] variant was unveiled at the 2016 [[Chicago Auto Show]].

The introduction of the SW should broaden the appeal of the Optima. The SW variant is sold worldwide excluding the North American and South Korea market, as station wagons have been overtaken by Crossover Utility Vehicles as the standard family hauler.\n\n===Kia Optima Convertible Concept===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Kia Optima Convertible Concept\n| image        = \n| manufacturer = [[Kia Motors|Kia]]\n| production   = 2015 ([[concept car]])\n| class        = [[Mid-size car|Mid-size]]\n| body_style   = 4-door [[convertible]]\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n| engine       = 1.6 L [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase    = \n}}\n\nThe Kia Optima Convertible Concept was shown in 2015; a 4-door [[concept car]] similar to the Kia Optima [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] without a roof and rear-hinged doors for the rear passengers in place of the front-hinged doors of the production car. The new Optima will continue to offer its familiar 2.4L and 2.0T Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder engines, though will also offer a new engine option for 2016: an all-new 1.6T Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder engine. As before, no V6 engine options will be available. While the 2.4L and 2.0T engines will be paired with an automatic transmission, the 1.6T engine will be paired with an all-new seven-speed Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT). All engines will offer improved fuel economy ratings.\n\nA Hybrid version has not yet been announced, however, it is likely that Kia will release a [[hybrid car|hybrid]] Optima by 2017. Like its [[Hyundai Sonata Hybrid]] platform mate, the existing Optima Hybrid will most likely continue to be sold as a 2016 model, with the new model debuting by mid-2016.\n\nAn all-new, upscale interior will offer an optional UVO infotainment system, with support for both Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto technologies. Top-of-the-line Optimas will include a hand-stitched dashboard, quilted luxury leather seating surfaces, high-quality aluminum interior trim panels, Advanced Smart Cruise Control, a Surround-View Monitor, and Bi-Xenon LED Front [[Headlamp]]s with Auto-Leveling. Blind-Spot Detection and Backup Warning Sensors will also be available, as will Automatic Emergency Braking.\n\nStandard features for the new Optima are expected to include, as with the current Optima: keyless entry, an A/M-F/M stereo with SIRIUS-XM Satellite Radio, single-disc CD/MP3 player, iPod/USB and auxiliary audio input jacks, and Bluetooth with hands-free stereo streaming of audio, six speakers, alloy wheels, and premium cloth seating surfaces.\n\n===Facelift===\nThe facelifted Kia Optima was officially revealed at the 2018 Geneva motor show.

However, the styling is unique, featuring Z-shaped running lights, a textured grille and a chrome strip that runs along the window line and becomes more prominent at the C-pillar. Under the hood, engines mostly mirror that of the Sonata, but the Optima receives a high-performance 2.5L [[turbocharged]] I4 which produces 286 horsepower. The interior has been redesigned significantly as well, with an optional 12.3 inch digital cluster and 10.3 inch center screen, augmented by Apple Carplay/Android Auto and an optional 12-speaker Bose audio system. All-wheel drive is newly available, further distinguishing it from the Sonata. The Optima will have several driver-assistance technology features available, including forward-collision warning and automated emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:20191227 K5 Rear Side.png|Rear view\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Engines ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=7|Petrol engines\n|- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\"\n!Model\n!Engine\n!Displacement\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Note\n!{{CO2}} emissions ([[Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure|WLTP]])\n|-\n|''[[Hyundai Smartstream Engine|Smartstream G1.6]]'' T-GDi [[Continuous variable valve timing|'''CVVD''']]||1.6&nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|I4]]||1598 cc||{{Convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm||{{Convert|265|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1500\u20134500 rpm||||122-134 g/km\n|-\n|''[[Hyundai Smartstream Engine|Smartstream G2.0]] MPi''||rowspan=\"1\"|2.0&nbsp;L  [[Inline-four engine|I4]]||1999 cc||{{Convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6500 rpm||{{Convert|196|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4800 rpm||||126\u2013129 g/km\n|-\n|''[[Hyundai Smartstream Engine|Smartstream G2.5]] GDi''||rowspan=\"1\"|2.5&nbsp;L  [[Inline-four engine|I4]]||2497 cc||{{Convert|194|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6100 rpm||{{Convert|245|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm||||?-? g/km\n|-\n|''[[Hyundai Smartstream Engine|Smartstream G2.5]] T-GDi''||rowspan=\"1\"|2.5&nbsp;L  [[Inline-four engine|I4]]||2497 cc||{{Convert|304|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm||{{Convert|422|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1750\u20134000 rpm||||?-? g/km\n|}\n\n==Motorsport==\nThe third generation Kia Optima is an official entry in the [[Pirelli World Challenge]].

The Optima was sold until 2006, when it was replaced by the Magentis.\n\n===Safety===\nThe 2001 Optima received Poor to Average ratings from the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/kia/optima-4-door-sedan/2001 |title=2001 Kia Optima |publisher=[[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] |accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Test'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Rating'''\n|-\n|Overall:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{rating|1|5}}\n|-\n|Moderate overlap front:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Average\n|-\n|Side:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Poor\n|-\n|Head restraints & seats:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Poor\n|}\n\n===Update===\nThe 2002 Optima received a minor update.

This generation differed further from the [[Hyundai Sonata]] donor vehicle than the previous model. Unlike the previous Optima though, this vehicle uses a global platform, unique to Kia, designated \"MG\". The car continues to be built in [[South Korea]] and shares its 2.4-liter [[inline-four engine]], five-speed ''[[Tiptronic|Sportmatic]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]] or five-speed [[manual transmission]] with the Sonata.\n\nThe second generation Kia Optima was launched in Malaysia on 15 August 2007 powered by a 2.0 liter Theta DOHC CVVT engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission.\n\n===Safety===\nThe Optima received a crash test rating of five stars from the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kia.com/optima/optima-safety.php |title=internationallanding |publisher=Kia.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> and four stars from [[EuroNCAP]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carpages.co.uk/kia/kia-magentis-review-part-1-03-12-06.asp |title=Kia Magentis Review |publisher=Carpages.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> The 2006 Optima received Marginal to Good ratings from the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/kia/optima-4-door-sedan/2006 |title=2006 Kia Optima |publisher=[[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] |accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Test'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Rating'''\n|-\n|Overall:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{rating|3|5}}\n|-\n|Moderate overlap front:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Good\n|-\n|Side:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Average\n|-\n|Roof strength:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Marginal\n|-\n|Head restraints & seats:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Good\n|}\n\n===Update===\n[[File:2010 Kia Optima EX -- 06-16-2010.jpg|thumb|left| Kia Optima EX (US; facelift)]]\n[[File:2010 Kia Optima SX -- 06-16-2010.jpg|thumb|left| Kia Optima SX (US; facelift)]]\n[[File:2009-2010 Kia Optima (MG) LX sedan (2010-03-22).jpg|thumbnail|left|Kia Optima LX (US; facelift)]]\nThe Optima was revised and updated in 2008, debuting at the [[New York International Auto Show]] (as a 2009 model year). This update features new front-end styling and tail lamps. In addition to the revised exterior, length is also slightly increased by roughly {{convert|70|mm|in}} to approximately {{convert|4800|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. There is also a new engine and the interior has also been revised.<ref>[http://www.thetorquereport.com/2008/03/2009_kia_optima_debuts_in_new.html Redesigned 2009 Kia Optima Debuts in New York] 20 March 2008, The Torque Report</ref> Main changes in the interior are a redesigned instrument cluster and a [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]/AM/FM/MP3/CD with an auxiliary jack. In certain markets, the option of satellite navigation is offered.\n\nThe new ''[[Hyundai Theta engine|Theta II]]'' 2.4-liter I4 employs dual continuously [[variable valve timing]] (CVVT) and a variable intake system (VIS) to increase power to {{convert|131|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, while returning improved fuel consumption over its predecessor. Torque is rated at {{convert|229|Nm|abbr=on}}. There is a 2.0L I4 for other markets with either a 5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic transmission. Power is rated at {{Convert|164|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6200 RPM and {{Convert|197|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|abbr=on}} of torque. Acceleration for the 2.0L is {{convert|0|-|100|km/h|abbr=on}} in 9.2 seconds for the 5 speed manual and 10.1 seconds for the 4 speed automatic. Top speed rated up to {{Convert|208|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} outside of the US. The 2.7-liter [[V6]] offers few changes to the previous model, though power is increased to {{convert|144|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, and torque to {{convert|249|Nm|abbr=on}}. Acceleration for the 5-speed automatic takes it from {{Convert|0|-|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 8.9sec with a top speed up to {{Convert|220|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. A five-speed manual transmission is standard in the base model, and a five-speed automatic is included with mid- and high-end levels (or as an option in the base model).\n\n2010 models see the addition of a [[Electronic key|Proximity Key]] with Push-Button Start and paddle shifters on SX models.\n\nIn Australia, the Magentis was introduced in August 2006, and replaced the Optima. Initially available with a choice of 2.4&nbsp;L 4-cylinder or 2.7&nbsp;L V6 engines, the Magentis' sales never caught on, with sales peaking at only 741 units in 2007. In 2008, the V6 engine was dropped, as was the EX-L model, leaving only the entry-level 2.4&nbsp;L EX on sale until its discontinuation in 2009. While the facelifted 2010 model was never officially launched, a very small number were imported for \"evaluation\" purposes, and eventually sold to the public as demos.\n\n====U.S. engines====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Type!!Model Years!!Power@rpm!!Torque@rpm\n|-\n|{{convert|2359|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 2.4&nbsp;L [[Hyundai Theta engine|''Theta II'']] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] || 2006.5\u20132008 || {{convert|162|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 5800 || {{convert|164|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000\n|-\n|{{convert|2359|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 2.4&nbsp;L [[Hyundai Theta engine|''Theta II'']] I4||2009\u20132010|| {{convert|175|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6000|| {{convert|169|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000\n|-\n|{{convert|2656|cc|cuin||abbr=on}}  2.7&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai Engine|Delta]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||2006|| {{convert|170|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6000|| {{convert|181|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|{{convert|2657|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 2.7&nbsp;L [[Hyundai Mu engine|''Mu'']] V6||2006.5-2008|| {{convert|185|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6000|| {{convert|182|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4000\n|-\n|2009\u20132010|| {{convert|194|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6000|| {{convert|184|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4500\n|-\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|TF/QF}}Third generation (2010\u20132015)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name          = Third generation (TF)\n| image         = 2011 Kia Optima SX -- 08-26-2011.jpg\n| caption       =\n| aka           = {{Plainlist|\n*Kia K5 (South Korea, China)\n*Kia Optima K5 (Malaysia)\n}}\n| production    = 2010\u20132015\n| assembly      = {{Plainlist|\n*South Korea: [[Hwaseong, Gyeonggi|Hwaseong]] ([[List of Kia design and manufacturing facilities#Hwaseong Plant|Hwaseong Plant]])\n*China: [[Yancheng]] ([[List of Kia design and manufacturing facilities#Yancheng Plant|Yancheng Plant]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n*Kazakhstan: [[Oskemen]] (Azia Avto)\n*Russia: [[Kaliningrad]] ([[Avtotor]])\n*United States: [[West Point, Georgia|West Point, GA]] ([[List of Kia design and manufacturing facilities#Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia (KMMG)|KMMG]])<ref>{{cite web|author= Chris Shunk RSS feed |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/04/22/kia-adding-optima-production-line-to-georgia-plant/ |title=Kia adding optima production line to georgia plant |publisher=Autoblog.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n| designer      = {{Plainlist|\n*[[Peter Schreyer]]\n*[[Mikl\u00f3s Kov\u00e1cs (automobile designer)|Mikl\u00f3s Kov\u00e1cs]]\n*Davide Limongelli\n}}\n| body_style    = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| platform      =\n| related       = [[Hyundai Sonata]] (YF)\n| engine        = {{Plainlist|\n*2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai Theta engine|Theta II]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] ([[Petrol engine|gasoline]])\n*2.0&nbsp;L ''Theta II'' [[Gasoline direct injection|GDI]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] I4 (gasoline)\n*2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai Nu engine|Nu]]'' [[Continuous variable valve timing|''CVVL'']] I4 (gasoline)\n*2.4&nbsp;L ''Theta II'' I4 (gasoline)\n*2.4&nbsp;L ''Theta II'' GDI I4 (gasoline)\n*1.7&nbsp;L ''[[Hyundai U engine|U2]]'' [[Common rail|CRDi]] [[Turbodiesel|TD]] I4 ([[Diesel engine|diesel]])\n*2.0&nbsp;L ''D4EA'' CRDi TD I4 (diesel)\n}}\n| transmission  = {{Plainlist|\n*6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n*6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n}}\n| wheelbase     = {{convert|2795|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| length        = {{convert|4845|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| width         = {{convert|1835|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| height        = {{convert|1455|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| weight        = {{convert|1391|-|1411|kg|lb|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|1535|kg|lb|abbr=on}} <small>(Turbo)</small><br />{{convert|1583|kg|lb|abbr=on}} <small>(Hybrid)</small>\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 2012 Kia Optima (TF) Si sedan (2015-12-24) 02.jpg\n| caption1 = Kia Optima Si (Australia; pre-facelift)\n| image2 = Kia optima interior.jpg\n| caption2 = Interior\n}}\n\nThe completely redesigned Optima, sharing the same platform as its sibling [[Hyundai i40]], named the '''Kia K5''' in the South Korean and China market, made its world debut at the 2010 [[New York Auto Show]]. It features a much sleeker, sportier profile designed by new Kia design chief [[Peter Schreyer]], following the new design language featured on the [[Kia Forte]], [[Kia Sorento]], and upcoming [[Kia Sportage]] and [[Kia Cadenza]] \u2014 and using Kia's new corporate grille, known as the [[Kia Motors#Design emphasis|Tiger Nose]], also designed by Schreyer. Lead designer of the TF in the team of Peter Schreyer and Miklos Kovacs was the Italian Davide Limongelli. For the first time, this model will be using the Optima name worldwide, where the Magentis name had been used previously.\n\nAs with its [[Hyundai Sonata]] sibling, the Optima's lineup has been replaced with a universal GDI 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, either mated to a 6-speed [[automatic transmission]] with Eco dash display, or to a 6-speed [[manual transmission]] that is only standard on the LX model.  Sales began in fall 2010. The new K5 was released in the South Korean market on 29 April 2010.\n\nThe new Optima retains its trim lines of the base LX, upscale EX, and sporty SX models. Standard equipment includes safety features such as [[electronic stability control]] (ESC) and [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] brakes, as well as Sirius Satellite Radio, cooled glove box, [[iPod]] connectivity, and handsfree [[Bluetooth]] phone operation.  Starting in October 2013, on LX models, Kia will offer the [[Kia UVO|UVO]] infotainment system by [[Microsoft]] as part of the convenience package.  EX model options include Kia's new [[Kia UVO|UVO]] infotainment system by [[Microsoft]], integrated backup camera, and [[Electronic key|Proximity Key]] with Push-Button Start. A panoramic moonroof, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats and a navigation system are also available. SX models add a rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]], metal pedals, black hybrid metal and carbon insert trim, paddle shifters, and illuminated scuff plates.\n\nA Hybrid model and a Turbo model were also released. In addition, a wagon version was planned for European markets, and two-door coup\u00e9 version was mooted for the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/248826/ |title=Kia to launch Magentis estate |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=19 April 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> The turbo model will have the same powertrain as the Hyundai Sonata 2.0T.<ref name=\"kiaturbo.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kiaturbo.com |title=Optima Turbo |publisher=Kiaturbo.com.com|accessdate=2 August 2011}}</ref> The turbocharged model will have {{Convert|274|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|269|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque in the North American model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turbosonata.com/rumors-news-f1/specs-t2.htm |title=Specs |publisher=Turbosonata.com |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref> The car is estimated to obtain {{convert|34|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} on the highway.<ref name=\"kia.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kia.com/#/optima/specifications/|title=Specifications|accessdate=6 January 2011|work=kia.com}}</ref>\n\nThe third generation Kia Optima is built and manufactured in [[West Point, Georgia]], which began in 2011 with the 2012 model.\n\nIn Australia, the new Optima went on sale in January 2011.

The new Optima will continue to offer its familiar 2.4L and 2.0T Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder engines, though will also offer a new engine option for 2016: an all-new 1.6T Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder engine. As before, no V6 engine options will be available. While the 2.4L and 2.0T engines will be paired with an automatic transmission, the 1.6T engine will be paired with an all-new seven-speed Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT). All engines will offer improved fuel economy ratings.\n\nA Hybrid version has not yet been announced, however, it is likely that Kia will release a [[hybrid car|hybrid]] Optima by 2017. Like its [[Hyundai Sonata Hybrid]] platform mate, the existing Optima Hybrid will most likely continue to be sold as a 2016 model, with the new model debuting by mid-2016.\n\nAn all-new, upscale interior will offer an optional UVO infotainment system, with support for both Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto technologies.

However, the styling is unique, featuring Z-shaped running lights, a textured grille and a chrome strip that runs along the window line and becomes more prominent at the C-pillar. Under the hood, engines mostly mirror that of the Sonata, but the Optima receives a high-performance 2.5L [[turbocharged]] I4 which produces 286 horsepower. The interior has been redesigned significantly as well, with an optional 12.3 inch digital cluster and 10.3 inch center screen, augmented by Apple Carplay/Android Auto and an optional 12-speaker Bose audio system. All-wheel drive is newly available, further distinguishing it from the Sonata. The Optima will have several driver-assistance technology features available, including forward-collision warning and automated emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:20191227 K5 Rear Side.png|Rear view\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Engines ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=7|Petrol engines\n|- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\"\n!Model\n!Engine\n!Displacement\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Note\n!{{CO2}} emissions ([[Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure|WLTP]])\n|-\n|''[[Hyundai Smartstream Engine|Smartstream G1.6]]'' T-GDi [[Continuous variable valve timing|'''CVVD''']]||1.6&nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|I4]]||1598 cc||{{Convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm||{{Convert|265|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1500\u20134500 rpm||||122-134 g/km\n|-\n|''[[Hyundai Smartstream Engine|Smartstream G2.0]] MPi''||rowspan=\"1\"|2.0&nbsp;L  [[Inline-four engine|I4]]||1999 cc||{{Convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6500 rpm||{{Convert|196|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4800 rpm||||126\u2013129 g/km\n|-\n|''[[Hyundai Smartstream Engine|Smartstream G2.5]] GDi''||rowspan=\"1\"|2.5&nbsp;L  [[Inline-four engine|I4]]||2497 cc||{{Convert|194|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6100 rpm||{{Convert|245|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm||||?-? g/km\n|-\n|''[[Hyundai Smartstream Engine|Smartstream G2.5]] T-GDi''||rowspan=\"1\"|2.5&nbsp;L  [[Inline-four engine|I4]]||2497 cc||{{Convert|304|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm||{{Convert|422|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1750\u20134000 rpm||||?-? g/km\n|}\n\n==Motorsport==\nThe third generation Kia Optima is an official entry in the [[Pirelli World Challenge]].

Manufacturers are expected to implement the appropriate specifications for their device in order to ensure compatibility. A device may contain implementations of multiple profiles.\n\nThe majority of current low energy application profiles are based on the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT), a general specification for sending and receiving short pieces of data, known as attributes, over a low energy link.<ref>Bluetooth SIG [https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications Adopted specifications]</ref> The [[Bluetooth mesh]] profile is an exception to this rule, being based on the General Access Profile (GAP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/mesh|title=Bluetooth Mesh and the IOT|last=bluetooth|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Mesh profiles ===\nBluetooth mesh profiles use Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with other Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the network. Each device can pass the information forward to other Bluetooth Low Energy devices creating a \"mesh\" effect. For example, switching off an entire building of lights from a single smartphone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/markets/smart-building|title=Smart Building - Bluetooth Technology Website|author=|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref>\n\n* MESH (Mesh Profile) \u2014 for base mesh networking.\n* MMDL ([[Bluetooth mesh networking#Mesh models|Mesh models]]) \u2014 for application layer definitions. Term \"model\" is used in mesh specifications instead of \"profile\" to avoid ambiguities.\n\n=== Health care profiles ===\nThere are many profiles for Bluetooth Low Energy devices in healthcare applications.

Instead of the classic Bluetooth 79 1-MHz channels, Bluetooth Low Energy has 40 2-MHz channels. Within a channel, data is transmitted using [[GFSK|Gaussian frequency shift modulation]], similar to classic Bluetooth's Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1&nbsp;Mbit/s (with an option of 2&nbsp;Mbit/s in Bluetooth 5), and the maximum transmit power is 10&nbsp;mW (100&nbsp;mW in Bluetooth 5). Further details are given in Volume 6 Part A (Physical Layer Specification) of the [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=229737 Bluetooth Core Specification V4.0].\n\nBluetooth Low Energy uses [[frequency hopping]] to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different; as a result, while both [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and [[ETSI]] classify Bluetooth technology as an [[FHSS]] scheme, Bluetooth Low Energy is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]].<ref>Bluetooth Special Interest Group [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=237781 \"Bluetooth Low Energy Regulatory Aspects\"], April 2011</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Note that power consumption is not part of the Bluetooth specification.\n\n=== Advertising and discovery ===\nBLE devices are detected through a procedure based on broadcasting advertising packets. This is done using 3 separate channels (frequencies), in order to reduce interference. The advertising device sends a packet on at least one of these three channels, with a repetition period called the advertising interval. For reducing the chance of multiple consecutive collisions, a random delay of up to 10 milliseconds is added to each advertising interval. The scanner listens to the channel for a duration called the scan window, which is periodically repeated every scan interval.\n\nThe discovery latency is therefore determined by a probabilistic process and depends on the three parameters (viz., the advertising interval, the scan interval and the scan window). The discovery scheme of BLE adopts a periodic-interval based technique, for which upper bounds on the discovery latency can be inferred for most parametrizations. While the discovery latencies of BLE can be approximated by models<ref>{{Cite journal|title=PI-LatencyComp - Neighbor Discovery in BLE-Like protocols|url=https://codeocean.com/2017/08/08/pi-latencycomp-neighbor-discovery-in-ble-like-protocols|journal=CodeOcean|volume=|pages=|doi=10.24433/co.fec70c60-c265-4eea-9e37-8f7222ec5c92|via=|year=2017|last1=Kindt|first1=Philipp H.}}</ref> for purely periodic interval-based protocols, the random delay added to each advertising interval and the three-channel discovery can cause deviations from these predictions, or potentially lead to unbounded latencies for certain parametrizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kindt|first=P.

The [[application programming interface]] offered by a Bluetooth Low Energy aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.<ref>See for example Apple's [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CoreBluetooth_Framework/_index.html Core Bluetooth] framework</ref> GATT has the following terminology:\n\n;Client\n:A device that initiates GATT commands and requests, and accepts responses, for example, a computer or smartphone.\n;Server\n:A device that receives GATT commands and requests, and returns responses, for example, a temperature sensor.\n;Characteristic\n:A data value transferred between client and server, for example, the current battery voltage.\n;Service\n:A collection of related characteristics, which operate together to perform a particular function. For instance, the ''Health Thermometer'' service includes characteristics for a temperature measurement value, and a time interval between measurements.\n;Descriptor\n:A descriptor provides additional information about a characteristic. For instance, a temperature value characteristic may have an indication of its units (e.g. Celsius), and the maximum and minimum values which the sensor can measure. Descriptors are optional \u2013 each characteristic can have any number of descriptors.\n\nSome service and characteristic values are used for administrative purposes \u2013 for instance, the model name and serial number can be read as standard characteristics within the ''Generic Access'' service. Services may also include other services as sub-functions; the main functions of the device are so-called ''primary'' services, and the auxiliary functions they refer to are ''secondary'' services.\n\n==== Identifiers ====\n\nServices, characteristics, and descriptors are collectively referred to as ''attributes'', and identified by [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]]s. Any implementer may pick a random or pseudorandom UUID for [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] uses, but the Bluetooth SIG have reserved a range of UUIDs (of the form ''{{not a typo|xxxxxxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB}}'' <ref>See sec 2.5.1 of the ''Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification''</ref>) for standard attributes. For efficiency, these identifiers are represented as 16-bit or 32-bit values in the protocol, rather than the 128 bits required for a full UUID. For example, the ''Device Information'' service has the short code 0x180A, rather than {{not a typo|0000180A-0000-1000-}}... . The full list is kept in the [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services/ Bluetooth Assigned Numbers] document online.\n\n==== GATT operations ====\n\nThe GATT protocol provides a number of commands for the client to discover information about the server. These include:\n* Discover UUIDs for all primary services\n* Find a service with a given UUID\n* Find secondary services for a given primary service\n* Discover all characteristics for a given service\n* Find characteristics matching a given UUID\n* Read all descriptors for a particular characteristic\n\nCommands are also provided to ''read'' (data transfer from server to client) and ''write'' (from client to server) the values of characteristics:\n* A value may be read either by specifying the characteristic's UUID, or by a ''handle'' value (which is returned by the information discovery commands above).\n* Write operations always identify the characteristic by handle, but have a choice of whether or not a response from the server is required.\n* 'Long read' and 'Long write' operations can be used when the length of the characteristic's data exceeds the [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] of the radio link.\n\nFinally, GATT offers ''notifications'' and ''indications''. The client may request a notification for a particular characteristic from the server. The server can then send the value to the client whenever it becomes available. For instance, a temperature sensor server may notify its client every time it takes a measurement. This avoids the need for the client to [[Polling (computer science)|poll]] the server, which would require the server's radio circuitry to be constantly operational.\n\nAn ''indication'' is similar to a notification, except that it requires a response from the client, as confirmation that it has received the message.\n\n==== Battery impact ====\n\n[[File:BLE Chipsets Power.png|thumb|upright|300px|Bluetooth Low Energy chipset power consumption profiles with different configuration parameters, as per The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware by Aislelabs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/|title=The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware: A Comprehensive Report by Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref>]]\n\nBluetooth Low Energy is designed to enable devices with low power consumption. Several chipmakers including [[Cambridge Silicon Radio]], [[Dialog Semiconductor]], [[Nordic Semiconductor]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Cypress Semiconductor]], [[Silicon Labs]] and [[Texas Instruments]] have introduced their Bluetooth Low Energy optimized chipsets over the last few years. Devices with peripheral and central roles have different power requirements. A study by beacon software company, [[Aislelabs]], reported that peripherals, such as proximity beacons, usually function for 1\u20132 years with a 1,000mAh coin cell battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/11/04/how-to-find-the-best-beacon-hardware-for-everything-from-stores-to-cities/|title=How to find the best beacon hardware for everything from stores to cities|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-10-04|accessdate=2014-10-11}}</ref> This is possible because of power efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol which only transmits small packets as compared to Bluetooth Classic which is also suitable for audio and high bandwidth data.\n\nIn contrast, a continuous scan for the same beacons in central role can consume 1,000 mAh in a few hours. Android and iOS devices also have very different battery impact depending on type of scans and number of Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/08/14/in-terms-of-battery-life-android-devices-are-more-optimized-for-ibeacons-than-iphones/|title=In terms of battery life, Android devices are more optimized for iBeacons than iPhones|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref> With the newer chipsets and advances in software, both Android and iOS phones now have negligible power consumption in real-life Bluetooth Low Energy use scenarios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/|title=iBeacon Battery Drain on Apple vs Android: A Technical Report \u2013 Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 2M PHY ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced a new transmission mode with a doubled [[symbol rate]]. Bluetooth LE has been traditionally transmitting 1 bit per symbol so that theoretically the data rate doubles as well. However the new mode doubles the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] from about 1&nbsp;MHz to about 2&nbsp;MHz which makes for more interferences on the edge regions. The partitioning of the ISM frequency band has not changed being still 40&nbsp;channels spaced at a distance of 2&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=edn2017>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459086/Bluetooth-5--More-speeds--more-range--new-RF-tests|title=Bluetooth 5: More speeds, more range, new RF tests|author=Allen Henley|date=2017-11-21|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref> This is an essential differences over Bluetooth 2 EDR which did also double the data rate but it is doing that by employing a \u03c0/4-DQPSK or 8-DPSK [[phase modulation]] on a 1&nbsp;MhZ channel while Bluetooth 5 continues to use just frequency shift keying.\n\nThe traditional transmission of 1 Mbit in the Bluetooth Basic Rate was renamed 1M PHY in Bluetooth 5. The new mode at a doubled symbol speed was introduced as the 2M PHY. In Bluetooth Low Energy every transmission starts on the 1M PHY leaving it to the application to initiate a switch to the 2M PHY. In that case both sender and receiver will switch to the 2M PHY for transmissions. This is designed to facilitate firmware updates where the application can switch back to a traditional 1M PHY in case of errors. In reality the target device should be close to the programming station (at a few meters).\n\n=== LE Coded ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced two new modes with lower data rate. The symbol rate of the new \"Coded PHY\" is the same as the Base Rate 1M PHY but in mode S=2 there are two symbols transmitted per data bit. In mode S=2 only a simple Pattern Mapping P=1 is used which simply produces the same stuffing bit for each input data bit. In mode S=8 there are eight symbols per data bit with a Pattern Mapping P=4 producing contrasting symbol sequences - a 0 bit is encoded as binary 0011 and a 1 bit is encoded as binary 1100.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/long-distance-bluetooth-low-energy-bit-data-paths/|title=What is Bluetooth 5? Learn about the Bit Paths Behind the New BLE Standard|author=Mark Hughes}}</ref> In mode S=2 using P=1 the range doubles approximately, while in mode S=8 using P=4 it does quadruple.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/exploring-bluetooth-5-going-the-distance/|title=Exploring Bluetooth 5 -Going the Distance|first=Martin|last=Woolley|date=13 February 2017|website=Bluetooth Technology Website}}</ref>\n\nThe \"LE Coded\" transmissions have not only changed the error correction scheme but it uses a fundamentally new package format. Each \"LE Coded\" burst consists of three blocks. The switch block (\"extended preamble\") is transmitted on the LE 1M PHY but it does only consist of 10 times a binaryr '00111100' pattern. These 80 bits are not FEC encoded as usual but they are sent directly to the radio channel. It is followed by a header block (\"FEC Block 1\") which is always transmitted in S=8 mode. The header block does only contain the destination address (\"Access Address\" / 32 bit) and an encoding flag (\"Coding Indicator\" / 2 Bit). The Coding Indicator defines the Pattern Mapping used for the following payload block (\"FEC Block 2\") where S=2 is possible.<ref name=edn2018>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459130/Bluetooth-5-variations-complicate-PHY-testing|title=Bluetooth 5 variations complicate PHY testing|author=Dorine Gurney|date=2018-01-29|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref>\n\nThe new package format of Bluetooth 5 allows to transmit from 2 up to 256 bytes as the payload in a single burst. This is a lot more than the maximum of 31 bytes in Bluetooth 4. Along with reach measurements this should allow for localisation functions. As a whole the quadrupled range - at the same transmission power - is achieved at the expense of a lower data being at an eight with 125&nbsp;kBit. The old transmission package format, as it continues to be used in the 1M PHY and 2M PHY modes, has been named \"Uncoded\" in Bluetooth 5. The intermediate \"LE Coded\" S=2 mode allows for a  500&nbsp;kBit data rate in the payload which is both beneficial for shorter latencies as well lower power consumption as the burst time itself is shorter.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ANT (network)|ANT]]\n* [[ANT+]]\n* [[DASH7]]\n* [[Eddystone (Google)|Eddystone]]\n* [[IEEE 802.15]] / [[IEEE 802.15.4-2006]]\n* [[Indoor positioning system]] (IPS)\n*[[LoRa]]\n* [[MyriaNed]]\n* [[Ultra-wideband]] (UWB)\n* [[UWB Forum]]\n* [[WiMedia Alliance]]\n* [[WirelessHD]]\n* [[Wireless USB]]\n* [[Zigbee]]\n* [[Z-Wave]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications|title=Specifications - Bluetooth Technology Website|website=www.bluetooth.org}} \"Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification\" \u2013 GATT is described in full in Volume 3, Part G\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|https://www.bluetooth.com}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Gomez|first1=Carles|last2=Oller|first2=Joaquim|last3=Paradells|first3=Josep|title=Overview and Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy: An Emerging Low-Power Wireless Technology|journal=Sensors|volume=12|issue=9|date=29 August 2012|pages=11734\u201311753|issn=1424-8220|doi=10.3390/s120911734|pmc=3478807}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bluetooth Low Energy}}\n[[Category:Bluetooth]]\n[[Category:Open standards]]\n[[Category:Wireless networking]]\n[[Category:Radio-frequency identification]]\n[[Category:Tracking]]\n[[Category:Ubiquitous computing]]\n[[Category:Wireless locating]]\n[[Category:Indoor positioning system]]\n[[Category:Wireless communication systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n'''Bluetooth Low Energy''' ('''Bluetooth LE''', colloquially '''BLE''', formerly marketed as '''Bluetooth Smart'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310111443/https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-03-10|title=Bluetooth Smart or Version 4.0+ of the Bluetooth specification|website=bluetooth.com}}</ref>) is a [[Personal area network|wireless personal area network]] technology designed and marketed by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] (Bluetooth SIG) aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, [[Physical fitness|fitness]], beacons,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/beacons-retail-location.aspx |title=beacons |access-date=21 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024074548/http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/beacons-retail-location.aspx |archive-date=24 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> security, and home entertainment industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart.aspx|title=bluetooth.com: Bluetooth Smart|author=|date=|website=bluetooth.com}}</ref>  It is independent of BR / EDR and has no compatibility, but BR / EDR and LE can coexist.

Instead of the classic Bluetooth 79 1-MHz channels, Bluetooth Low Energy has 40 2-MHz channels. Within a channel, data is transmitted using [[GFSK|Gaussian frequency shift modulation]], similar to classic Bluetooth's Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1&nbsp;Mbit/s (with an option of 2&nbsp;Mbit/s in Bluetooth 5), and the maximum transmit power is 10&nbsp;mW (100&nbsp;mW in Bluetooth 5). Further details are given in Volume 6 Part A (Physical Layer Specification) of the [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=229737 Bluetooth Core Specification V4.0].\n\nBluetooth Low Energy uses [[frequency hopping]] to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different; as a result, while both [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and [[ETSI]] classify Bluetooth technology as an [[FHSS]] scheme, Bluetooth Low Energy is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]].<ref>Bluetooth Special Interest Group [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=237781 \"Bluetooth Low Energy Regulatory Aspects\"], April 2011</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Note that power consumption is not part of the Bluetooth specification.\n\n=== Advertising and discovery ===\nBLE devices are detected through a procedure based on broadcasting advertising packets. This is done using 3 separate channels (frequencies), in order to reduce interference. The advertising device sends a packet on at least one of these three channels, with a repetition period called the advertising interval. For reducing the chance of multiple consecutive collisions, a random delay of up to 10 milliseconds is added to each advertising interval. The scanner listens to the channel for a duration called the scan window, which is periodically repeated every scan interval.\n\nThe discovery latency is therefore determined by a probabilistic process and depends on the three parameters (viz., the advertising interval, the scan interval and the scan window). The discovery scheme of BLE adopts a periodic-interval based technique, for which upper bounds on the discovery latency can be inferred for most parametrizations. While the discovery latencies of BLE can be approximated by models<ref>{{Cite journal|title=PI-LatencyComp - Neighbor Discovery in BLE-Like protocols|url=https://codeocean.com/2017/08/08/pi-latencycomp-neighbor-discovery-in-ble-like-protocols|journal=CodeOcean|volume=|pages=|doi=10.24433/co.fec70c60-c265-4eea-9e37-8f7222ec5c92|via=|year=2017|last1=Kindt|first1=Philipp H.}}</ref> for purely periodic interval-based protocols, the random delay added to each advertising interval and the three-channel discovery can cause deviations from these predictions, or potentially lead to unbounded latencies for certain parametrizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kindt|first=P.

The [[application programming interface]] offered by a Bluetooth Low Energy aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.<ref>See for example Apple's [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CoreBluetooth_Framework/_index.html Core Bluetooth] framework</ref> GATT has the following terminology:\n\n;Client\n:A device that initiates GATT commands and requests, and accepts responses, for example, a computer or smartphone.\n;Server\n:A device that receives GATT commands and requests, and returns responses, for example, a temperature sensor.\n;Characteristic\n:A data value transferred between client and server, for example, the current battery voltage.\n;Service\n:A collection of related characteristics, which operate together to perform a particular function. For instance, the ''Health Thermometer'' service includes characteristics for a temperature measurement value, and a time interval between measurements.\n;Descriptor\n:A descriptor provides additional information about a characteristic. For instance, a temperature value characteristic may have an indication of its units (e.g. Celsius), and the maximum and minimum values which the sensor can measure. Descriptors are optional \u2013 each characteristic can have any number of descriptors.\n\nSome service and characteristic values are used for administrative purposes \u2013 for instance, the model name and serial number can be read as standard characteristics within the ''Generic Access'' service. Services may also include other services as sub-functions; the main functions of the device are so-called ''primary'' services, and the auxiliary functions they refer to are ''secondary'' services.\n\n==== Identifiers ====\n\nServices, characteristics, and descriptors are collectively referred to as ''attributes'', and identified by [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]]s. Any implementer may pick a random or pseudorandom UUID for [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] uses, but the Bluetooth SIG have reserved a range of UUIDs (of the form ''{{not a typo|xxxxxxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB}}'' <ref>See sec 2.5.1 of the ''Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification''</ref>) for standard attributes. For efficiency, these identifiers are represented as 16-bit or 32-bit values in the protocol, rather than the 128 bits required for a full UUID. For example, the ''Device Information'' service has the short code 0x180A, rather than {{not a typo|0000180A-0000-1000-}}... . The full list is kept in the [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services/ Bluetooth Assigned Numbers] document online.\n\n==== GATT operations ====\n\nThe GATT protocol provides a number of commands for the client to discover information about the server. These include:\n* Discover UUIDs for all primary services\n* Find a service with a given UUID\n* Find secondary services for a given primary service\n* Discover all characteristics for a given service\n* Find characteristics matching a given UUID\n* Read all descriptors for a particular characteristic\n\nCommands are also provided to ''read'' (data transfer from server to client) and ''write'' (from client to server) the values of characteristics:\n* A value may be read either by specifying the characteristic's UUID, or by a ''handle'' value (which is returned by the information discovery commands above).\n* Write operations always identify the characteristic by handle, but have a choice of whether or not a response from the server is required.\n* 'Long read' and 'Long write' operations can be used when the length of the characteristic's data exceeds the [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] of the radio link.\n\nFinally, GATT offers ''notifications'' and ''indications''. The client may request a notification for a particular characteristic from the server. The server can then send the value to the client whenever it becomes available. For instance, a temperature sensor server may notify its client every time it takes a measurement. This avoids the need for the client to [[Polling (computer science)|poll]] the server, which would require the server's radio circuitry to be constantly operational.\n\nAn ''indication'' is similar to a notification, except that it requires a response from the client, as confirmation that it has received the message.\n\n==== Battery impact ====\n\n[[File:BLE Chipsets Power.png|thumb|upright|300px|Bluetooth Low Energy chipset power consumption profiles with different configuration parameters, as per The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware by Aislelabs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/|title=The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware: A Comprehensive Report by Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref>]]\n\nBluetooth Low Energy is designed to enable devices with low power consumption. Several chipmakers including [[Cambridge Silicon Radio]], [[Dialog Semiconductor]], [[Nordic Semiconductor]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Cypress Semiconductor]], [[Silicon Labs]] and [[Texas Instruments]] have introduced their Bluetooth Low Energy optimized chipsets over the last few years. Devices with peripheral and central roles have different power requirements. A study by beacon software company, [[Aislelabs]], reported that peripherals, such as proximity beacons, usually function for 1\u20132 years with a 1,000mAh coin cell battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/11/04/how-to-find-the-best-beacon-hardware-for-everything-from-stores-to-cities/|title=How to find the best beacon hardware for everything from stores to cities|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-10-04|accessdate=2014-10-11}}</ref> This is possible because of power efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol which only transmits small packets as compared to Bluetooth Classic which is also suitable for audio and high bandwidth data.\n\nIn contrast, a continuous scan for the same beacons in central role can consume 1,000 mAh in a few hours. Android and iOS devices also have very different battery impact depending on type of scans and number of Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/08/14/in-terms-of-battery-life-android-devices-are-more-optimized-for-ibeacons-than-iphones/|title=In terms of battery life, Android devices are more optimized for iBeacons than iPhones|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref> With the newer chipsets and advances in software, both Android and iOS phones now have negligible power consumption in real-life Bluetooth Low Energy use scenarios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/|title=iBeacon Battery Drain on Apple vs Android: A Technical Report \u2013 Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 2M PHY ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced a new transmission mode with a doubled [[symbol rate]]. Bluetooth LE has been traditionally transmitting 1 bit per symbol so that theoretically the data rate doubles as well. However the new mode doubles the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] from about 1&nbsp;MHz to about 2&nbsp;MHz which makes for more interferences on the edge regions. The partitioning of the ISM frequency band has not changed being still 40&nbsp;channels spaced at a distance of 2&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=edn2017>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459086/Bluetooth-5--More-speeds--more-range--new-RF-tests|title=Bluetooth 5: More speeds, more range, new RF tests|author=Allen Henley|date=2017-11-21|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref> This is an essential differences over Bluetooth 2 EDR which did also double the data rate but it is doing that by employing a \u03c0/4-DQPSK or 8-DPSK [[phase modulation]] on a 1&nbsp;MhZ channel while Bluetooth 5 continues to use just frequency shift keying.\n\nThe traditional transmission of 1 Mbit in the Bluetooth Basic Rate was renamed 1M PHY in Bluetooth 5. The new mode at a doubled symbol speed was introduced as the 2M PHY. In Bluetooth Low Energy every transmission starts on the 1M PHY leaving it to the application to initiate a switch to the 2M PHY. In that case both sender and receiver will switch to the 2M PHY for transmissions. This is designed to facilitate firmware updates where the application can switch back to a traditional 1M PHY in case of errors. In reality the target device should be close to the programming station (at a few meters).\n\n=== LE Coded ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced two new modes with lower data rate. The symbol rate of the new \"Coded PHY\" is the same as the Base Rate 1M PHY but in mode S=2 there are two symbols transmitted per data bit. In mode S=2 only a simple Pattern Mapping P=1 is used which simply produces the same stuffing bit for each input data bit. In mode S=8 there are eight symbols per data bit with a Pattern Mapping P=4 producing contrasting symbol sequences - a 0 bit is encoded as binary 0011 and a 1 bit is encoded as binary 1100.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/long-distance-bluetooth-low-energy-bit-data-paths/|title=What is Bluetooth 5? Learn about the Bit Paths Behind the New BLE Standard|author=Mark Hughes}}</ref> In mode S=2 using P=1 the range doubles approximately, while in mode S=8 using P=4 it does quadruple.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/exploring-bluetooth-5-going-the-distance/|title=Exploring Bluetooth 5 -Going the Distance|first=Martin|last=Woolley|date=13 February 2017|website=Bluetooth Technology Website}}</ref>\n\nThe \"LE Coded\" transmissions have not only changed the error correction scheme but it uses a fundamentally new package format. Each \"LE Coded\" burst consists of three blocks. The switch block (\"extended preamble\") is transmitted on the LE 1M PHY but it does only consist of 10 times a binaryr '00111100' pattern. These 80 bits are not FEC encoded as usual but they are sent directly to the radio channel. It is followed by a header block (\"FEC Block 1\") which is always transmitted in S=8 mode. The header block does only contain the destination address (\"Access Address\" / 32 bit) and an encoding flag (\"Coding Indicator\" / 2 Bit). The Coding Indicator defines the Pattern Mapping used for the following payload block (\"FEC Block 2\") where S=2 is possible.<ref name=edn2018>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459130/Bluetooth-5-variations-complicate-PHY-testing|title=Bluetooth 5 variations complicate PHY testing|author=Dorine Gurney|date=2018-01-29|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref>\n\nThe new package format of Bluetooth 5 allows to transmit from 2 up to 256 bytes as the payload in a single burst. This is a lot more than the maximum of 31 bytes in Bluetooth 4. Along with reach measurements this should allow for localisation functions. As a whole the quadrupled range - at the same transmission power - is achieved at the expense of a lower data being at an eight with 125&nbsp;kBit. The old transmission package format, as it continues to be used in the 1M PHY and 2M PHY modes, has been named \"Uncoded\" in Bluetooth 5. The intermediate \"LE Coded\" S=2 mode allows for a  500&nbsp;kBit data rate in the payload which is both beneficial for shorter latencies as well lower power consumption as the burst time itself is shorter.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ANT (network)|ANT]]\n* [[ANT+]]\n* [[DASH7]]\n* [[Eddystone (Google)|Eddystone]]\n* [[IEEE 802.15]] / [[IEEE 802.15.4-2006]]\n* [[Indoor positioning system]] (IPS)\n*[[LoRa]]\n* [[MyriaNed]]\n* [[Ultra-wideband]] (UWB)\n* [[UWB Forum]]\n* [[WiMedia Alliance]]\n* [[WirelessHD]]\n* [[Wireless USB]]\n* [[Zigbee]]\n* [[Z-Wave]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications|title=Specifications - Bluetooth Technology Website|website=www.bluetooth.org}} \"Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification\" \u2013 GATT is described in full in Volume 3, Part G\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|https://www.bluetooth.com}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Gomez|first1=Carles|last2=Oller|first2=Joaquim|last3=Paradells|first3=Josep|title=Overview and Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy: An Emerging Low-Power Wireless Technology|journal=Sensors|volume=12|issue=9|date=29 August 2012|pages=11734\u201311753|issn=1424-8220|doi=10.3390/s120911734|pmc=3478807}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bluetooth Low Energy}}\n[[Category:Bluetooth]]\n[[Category:Open standards]]\n[[Category:Wireless networking]]\n[[Category:Radio-frequency identification]]\n[[Category:Tracking]]\n[[Category:Ubiquitous computing]]\n[[Category:Wireless locating]]\n[[Category:Indoor positioning system]]\n", "name_user": "Yerachmiel Coinblatt", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy"}
