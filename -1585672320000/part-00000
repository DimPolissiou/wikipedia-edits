{"title_page": "Patriot Parliament", "text_new": "{{Use Irish English|date=August 2019}}\nThe '''Patriot Parliament''' is the name commonly used for the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] called by [[James II of England|James II]] during the 1689 to 1691 [[Williamite war in Ireland|war in Ireland]]. The first since 1666, it held only one session, from 7 May 1689 to 20 July 1689.\n\nThe [[Irish House of Commons|Commons]] was 70 members short since there were no elections in the northern provinces; as a result its members were overwhelmingly [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] and [[Roman Catholic]].{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=437}} [[Richard Nagle|Sir Richard Nagle]] was elected [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] while the [[Irish House of Lords|Lords]] was led by [[Baron Fitton of Gawsworth|Baron Fitton]]; the opposition was led by [[Anthony Dopping|Anthony Dopping, Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath]].{{sfn|Moody, Martin and Byrne|2009|p=489}}\n\n[[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] historian [[Charles Gavan Duffy|Sir Charles Gavan Duffy]] first used the term \"Patriot Parliament\" in 1893 but in reality, it was deeply divided.{{sfn|Szechi|1997|p=44}} The deliberate destruction of its records after 1695 mean assessments, both negative and positive, often rely on individual accounts.{{sfn|Davis|1843|p=128}} \n\n==Background==\n[[File:King James II by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[James II of England|James II & VII]]]]\nDespite his [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[James II of England|James II]] became king in 1685 with widespread support in all three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, largely due to fear of civil war if he were bypassed; by 1688, it seemed only his removal could prevent one. He was ousted by [[William_III_of_England|William III]] and his wife [[Mary_II_of_England|Mary II]] in the November 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]], and went into exile in France, where he was sheltered by [[Louis_XIV_of_France|Louis XIV]].{{sfn|Wormsley|2015|p=189}}\n\nLouis wanted to absorb English resources from the European conflict known as the [[Nine Years War]]; the cheapest way to do this was a war in Ireland, where support for James was highest. Since England was his primary objective, James was extremely reluctant, but the French insisted and he landed in Ireland on 12 March 1689. Of the Irish people, 800,000 were Catholic, nearly 75% of the population, who supported James due to his own Catholicism; 75,000 were members of the Protestant [[Church of Ireland]], many of whom were sympathisers. The third group of 200,000 [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|NonConformists]] were concentrated in [[Ulster]], where they comprised nearly 50% of the population; hopes of gaining their support quickly faded.{{sfn|Harris|2006|pp=88-90}} \n\nFor many Catholics, the most pressing issues were the removal of [[penal laws]] restricting their ability to hold public office, and land reform. The proportion owned by Irish Catholics declined from 90% in 1600 to 22% by 1685, most of it concentrated in the hands of the Catholic [[Normans in Ireland#Old English|Old English]] elite. There was also a small middle class of Catholic and Protestant merchants, who objected to commercial restrictions imposed on Irish trade, policies continued by James prior to his exile.{{sfn|Harris|2005|pp=106-108}}\n\nDemands for greater autonomy by those allied with the [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Earl of Tyrconnell]] clashed with James' vision of a unitary state of England, Scotland and Ireland, where the role of Parliament and the church was simply to obey their monarch.{{sfn|Stephen|2010|pp=55-58}} Contrary to normal practice, James also claimed the right to appoint Catholic bishops and clergy in his kingdoms, which caused conflict with [[Pope Innocent XI]].{{sfn|Miller|2001|p=153}}\n\nIrish Catholic support for James was based on his religion and willingness to deliver their demands. In 1685, Gaelic poet [[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair]] celebrated his accession as ensuring the supremacy of Catholicism and the Irish language. Tyrconnell's expansion of the army by the creation of Catholic regiments was welcomed by Diarmuid Mac Carthaigh, as enabling the native Irish 'Tadhg' to be armed and to assert their dominance over 'John' the English Protestant.{{sfn|\u00d3 Ciardha|2000|pp=77-79}} \n\nConversely, most Irish Protestants viewed his policies as designed to \"utterly ruin the Protestant interest and the English interest in Ireland\".{{sfn|Lenihan|2008|p=175}} While James hoped to attract their support, Jacobitosm was restricted to \"doctrinaire Protestant clergymen, disgruntled Tory landowners and Catholic converts\", who viewed his removal as unlawful.{{sfn|\u00d3 Ciardha|2000|p=89}} While many were sympathetic, only a few Church of Ireland ministers refused to swear allegiance to the new regime and became [[Nonjuring_schism|Non-Jurors]]; the most famous was propagandist [[Charles_Leslie_(nonjuror)|Charles Leslie]].{{sfn|Doyle|1997|pp=29\u201330}}\n\n==Composition==\n{{Main article|Members of 1689 Irish Parliament}}\n[[File:TyrconnellBrighter.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Earl of Tyrconnell]], member of the Old English Catholic elite whose main objective was Irish autonomy]]\nIn March 1689, James landed in Ireland and issued writs for the first [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] since 1666. Tyrconnell ensured a predominately Catholic electorate by issuing new [[Borough#Ireland|borough]] charters, that added Catholics to city corporations, and removed \"disloyal members\", many Protestant.{{sfn|Gillen|2016|p=52}} The war prevented elections being held in [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Donegal|Donegal]], leaving the [[Irish House of Commons|Commons]] seventy [[Member_of_parliament|MPs]] short; six were Protestant, 224 Catholic.{{sfn|Doyle|1997|p=30}}  \n\n[[Richard Nagle|Sir Richard Nagle]], a wealthy lawyer and close ally of Tyrconnell, acted as [[Speaker (politics)|leader]] of the Commons.{{sfn|McGuire|2004|p=Online}} The [[Irish House of Lords|Lords]] was led by [[Baron Fitton of Gawsworth|Baron Fitton]], who spent 1664 to 1684 imprisoned for criminal libel; allegedly selected by James because he was a Protestant, he promptly converted to Catholicism.{{sfn|Slater|2007|p=Online}} The Lords included five Protestant peers, the most prominent being [[William Stewart, 1st Viscount Mountjoy|Viscount Mountjoy]], and four bishops from the [[Church of Ireland]], the [[Anthony Dopping|Bishop of Meath]] serving as leader of the opposition.{{sfn|Moody, Martin and Byrne|2009|p=489}}\n\nA French diplomat observed James had 'a heart too English to do anything that might vex the English.'{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=445}} He viewed the Irish campaign as a distraction from regaining the English throne, and as concessions to Irish Catholics cost him support from Protestants in England and Scotland, he made them with reluctance.{{sfn|Moody, Martin and Byrne|2009|p=490}}\n\nThis meant although Tyrconnell was personally loyal to James, the Catholic minority who benefited from the [[Act of Settlement 1662|1662 Land Settlement]] mistrusted him. Led by the Earl of Limerick, they wanted to negotiate from strength, and retain the gains made under Tyrconnell.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=436}} Some purchased lands confiscated in 1652, including Tyrconnell, Limerick and James himself; this placed them in opposition to those who wanted the position reset to 1641, and an end to their exclusion from government positions. While a minority in Parliament, they were a majority in the country.{{sfn|Szechi|1994|pp=47-48}}\n\nTraditionally, these differences were presented as an ethnic division between Irish Gaels and [[Normans_in_Ireland|Old English]]; in 1692, Jacobite historian Charles Kelly claimed Tyrconnell fatally weakened the cause by his opposition to the Gaels. There is some truth in this, particularly as Parliament failed to address compensation for estates confiscated prior to 1641, much of it from Gaelic landowners in [[Ulster]].{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=444}} Modern historians argue differences were based primarily on economics, although those who benefitted from the 1662 Settlement were mostly Old English, those who had not, mostly Gaelic.{{sfn|Connolly|2008|pp=186-187}}\n\n==Key legislation==\nThe 1689 Parliament \"ended up going much further than James would have liked, while...falling short of what many Irish Catholics hoped for.\"{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=440}} Called in order to raise funds for the war, Parliament approved a subsidy of \u00a320,000 per month, for 13 months but had no way to raise the funds.       \n\n'''Act of Recognition''' recognised James's right to the Crown of Ireland and compared the usurpation by [[William III of England|William III]] to the murder of James' father [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. It emphasised indefeasible hereditary rights and the [[Divine right of kings]]; these contradicted the 1689 English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and Scottish Articles of Grievances, which made explicit an assumed [[Social contract]] between a king and his subjects.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=439}}\n\n'''Declaratory Act''' affirmed the Kingdom of Ireland as always having been \"distinct\" from England, and no Act of the English Parliament was binding unless ratified by the Irish Parliament.{{sfn|Simms|1970|p=80}} However, [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]],  remained on the books; created in 1494, this effectively allowed the English Parliament to legislate for Ireland and James was unwilling to repeal it.{{sfn|Bartlett|2010|p=135}} \n\n'''Land Settlement'''; despite opposition in the Lords from Protestants, and the small number of Catholics who had purchased land since 1660, Parliament refused to approve taxes until James agreed to repeal the 1652 [[Cromwellian Settlement]], and [[Act_of_Settlement_1662|1662 Act]]. However, it failed to address compensation for estates confiscated prior to 1641, many held by Gaelic landowners, particularly those lost after [[Nine_Years'_War_(Ireland)|Tyrone's Rebellion]] in 1603.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=444}}\n\n'''[[Bill of Attainder]]'''; this named 2,470 Protestants as traitors, subject to confiscation of property and their lives.{{sfn|Firth|1937|pp=212-213}} While many viewed this as unwise, it was the only way to raise money for the taxes voted by Parliament; after defeat, it was used to justify a new round of confiscations.  \n\n'''Liberty of Conscience'''; this allowed freedom of worship and civic and political equality for Roman Catholics and Protestant [[Dissenter]]s, and repeal of the [[Oath of Supremacy]]. However, it retained the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]]; while James sought the abolition of penalties against liberty of conscience, he viewed the [[Church of Ireland]] as an essential element of his support and wanted to retain it, despite his own Catholicism.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=441}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nAfter defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]] in July 1690, the Jacobites abandoned Dublin and retreated to [[Limerick]], while James left Ireland. After the October 1691 [[Treaty of Limerick]] ended the war, all legislation enacted by the Patriot Parliament was declared void by the [[Parliament of England]].{{sfn|Hill|1961|p=256}} The 1695 Irish Parliament passed an Act declaring all actions of the \"late pretended Parliament\" void and ordered its records destroyed.{{sfn|Davis|1843|p=54}}\n\nFor 19th century Irish nationalists, its declaration of autonomy was the most important act of the 1689 Parliament. {{sfn|Moody|2009|p=491}} Shortly before his death in 1843, [[Young Ireland]] leader [[Thomas Davis (Young Irelander)|Thomas Davis]] wrote a history of the Parliament, which explicitly linked it to  the [[Irish_Rebellion_of_1798|1798 Rebellion]].{{sfn|Sullivan|1979|pp=25-26}} The term \"Patriot Parliament\" was first used in 1893 by [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] historian [[Charles Gavan Duffy|Sir Charles Gavan Duffy]].{{sfn|Bartlett|2010|p=135}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book |last1=Bartlett |first1=Thomas |last2=Jeffery |first2=Keith |title=A Military History of Ireland |publisher=Cambridge UP |year=1997|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Connolly |first1=SJ |title=Divided Kingdom: Ireland 1630-1800 |date=2008 |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0199543472 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Thomas Osborne|title=The Irish Parliament of James II|date=1843|publisher=University College Cork|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Doyle |first1=Thomas |title=Jacobitism, Catholicism and the Irish Protestant Elite, 1700-1710 |journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland / Iris an D\u00e1 Chult\u00far |date=1997 |volume=12 |ref=harv |jstor=30071383}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Firth, CH (author) |first1=Davies, Godfrey (ed) |title=A Commentary on Macaulay's History of England |date=1937 |publisher=Hesperides Press |isbn=978-1443725637 |ref=harv |edition=2008}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Tim |title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685\u20131720 |date=2006 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0141016528|edition=2007|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hill|first=Christopher|title=The Century of Revolution, 1603-1714|date=1937|ref=harv|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415267397|edition=2002}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McGuire |first1=James |title=Nagle, Sir Richard |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford DNB |edition=Online |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=John |title=James II; A study in kingship |date=1978 |publisher=Methuen |isbn=978-0413652904|edition=1991|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Moody |last2=Martin |last3=Byrne (eds.) |title=A New History of Ireland: Volume III: Early Modern Ireland 1534-1691 |year=2009 |publisher=OUP |isbn=9780198202424|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Simms |first1=JG |title=Jacobite Ireland, 1685-91 |date=1970 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0710064462 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/jacobiteireland10000simm }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Slater |first1=Victor |title=Fitton, Alexander [styled Sir Alexander Fitton], Jacobite Baron Fitton |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford DNB |edition=Online |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Sullivan |first1=Eileen |title=Thomas Davis (Irish Writers Series) |date=1979 |publisher=Bucknell University Press |isbn=978-0838712344 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Szechi |first=Daniel |title=The Jacobites: Britain and Europe 1688-1788 |year=1994 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=9780719037740|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Wormsley|first1=David|title=James II: The Last Catholic King|date=2015|publisher=Allen Lane|isbn=014197706X|ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/E800002-045.html#p54|title=The Irish Parliament of James II|last=Davis|first=Thomas Osborne|work=CELT|publisher=University College Cork|page=54|accessdate=18 May 2017}}\n* [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/texts/E703001-003.xml Members of Parliament at Dublin, 1689]\n* [http://www.jacobite.ca/documents/1689recognition.htm Act of Recognition]\n* [http://www.jacobite.ca/documents/1689declaratory.htm Declaratory Act].\n* [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E800002-045/index.html On-line text of \"The Irish Parliament of James II\" by TO Davis, 1843]\n\n{{Lists of Irish MPs}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Historical Irish legislatures]]\n[[Category:1689 in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Parliament of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Ireland politics-related lists|Parliaments]]\n[[Category:Irish MPs 1689|*]]\n[[Category:Lists of members of the Parliament of Ireland|689]]\n[[Category:James II of England]]\n[[Category:Williamite War in Ireland]]\n[[Category:17th-century elections in Ireland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Irish English|date=August 2019}}\nThe '''Patriot Parliament''' is the name commonly used for the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] called by [[James II of England|James II]] during the 1689 to 1691 [[Williamite war in Ireland|war in Ireland]].

It was originally a minor hit for [[Marilyn McCoo]] and [[Billy Davis Jr.]] in 1978 on their album ''Marilyn & Billy''. A cover of the song was done by American singer [[Whitney Houston]], for her debut, [[Whitney Houston (album)|self-titled album]], which was released on February 14, 1985, by [[Arista Records]]. The song was the second [[Single (music)|single]] from the album in the [[United States]] and third worldwide.\n\nThe song received generally favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who picked it as one of the album's highlights and praised her vocals on the song. Whitney also earned her first [[Grammy Award]] with the song, on the category [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. Commercially, the song topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], being her first number one on the charts; it also went to number one in both the UK and Ireland, and was her first major hit in the British Isles. In the [[United States]], it was awarded a [[Gold certification|Gold]] certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 1995.\n\n==Background and release==\n\"Saving All My Love for You\" was written by [[Michael Masser]] and [[Gerry Goffin]] during the 1970s and originally recorded with [[Marilyn McCoo]] and [[Billy Davis Jr.]] on their LP \"Marilyn and Billy\" (1978).<ref name=allmusicmarilynandbilly>{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Andrew|title=Billy Davis, Jr. / Marilyn McCoo - Marilyn & Billy: Allmusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/marilyn-billy-mw0000877760|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}</ref> Years later, Masser saw Whitney for the first time when he went into New York City's Sweetwater club, an invitation made by [[Arista Records]] president [[Clive Davis]], and she was singing one of his songs, \"[[The Greatest Love of All]]\". After her performance, the singer told Masser that the song was one of her favorites and later, Masser was chosen by Arista to produce some tracks for Houston's self-titled debut.<ref name=allmusicsaving>{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Ed|title=Saving All My Love for You - Whitney Houston: Allmusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/saving-all-my-love-for-you-mt0003461200|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}</ref> After getting the right emotionally vulnerable-tailored take from Houston, the producer guaranteed her that it would become \"a woman's song\", meaning that women will feel a special affinity for the song.<ref name=allmusicsaving/>\n\nAfter the success of her previous single, \"[[You Give Good Love]]\", the label initially didn't think about releasing \"Saving All My Love for You\" as the next single. When Masser heard that another single besides the song was being considered for the next single, he made a friendly wager with Davis during one of Houston's performance at [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|the Roxy Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]]. He proposed that if all the women get on their feet when Houston sings \"Saving...\", then Davis would agree that it should be the next single.<ref name=allmusicsaving/> Ultimately, the song was released as the second single in the [[United States]] and third single worldwide.\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"Saving All My Love for You\" is a [[soul music|soul]] and [[R&B]] song, composed in the key of [[A major]], having a slowly tempo of 84 beats per minute.

Houston's mother [[Cissy Houston]] didn't at all like the scenario described in the lyrics, claiming that the song's message would reflect badly on her daughter.

It was originally a minor hit for [[Marilyn McCoo]] and [[Billy Davis Jr.]] in 1978 on their album ''Marilyn & Billy''. A cover of the song was done by American singer [[Whitney Houston]], for her debut, [[Whitney Houston (album)|self-titled album]], which was released on February 14, 1985, by [[Arista Records]]. The song was the second [[Single (music)|single]] from the album in the [[United States]] and third worldwide.\n\nThe song received generally favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who picked it as one of the album's highlights and praised her vocals on the song. Whitney also earned her first [[Grammy Award]] with the song, on the category [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. Commercially, the song topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], being her first number one on the charts; it also went to number one in both the UK and Ireland, and was her first major hit in the British Isles. In the [[United States]], it was awarded a [[Gold certification|Gold]] certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 1995.\n\n==Background and release==\n\"Saving All My Love for You\" was written by [[Michael Masser]] and [[Gerry Goffin]] during the 1970s and originally recorded with [[Marilyn McCoo]] and [[Billy Davis Jr.]] on their LP \"Marilyn and Billy\" (1978).<ref name=allmusicmarilynandbilly>{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Andrew|title=Billy Davis, Jr. / Marilyn McCoo - Marilyn & Billy: Allmusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/marilyn-billy-mw0000877760|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}</ref> Years later, Masser saw Whitney for the first time when he went into New York City's Sweetwater club, an invitation made by [[Arista Records]] president [[Clive Davis]], and she was singing one of his songs, \"[[The Greatest Love of All]]\". After her performance, the singer told Masser that the song was one of her favorites and later, Masser was chosen by Arista to produce some tracks for Houston's self-titled debut.<ref name=allmusicsaving>{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Ed|title=Saving All My Love for You - Whitney Houston: Allmusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/saving-all-my-love-for-you-mt0003461200|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}</ref> After getting the right emotionally vulnerable-tailored take from Houston, the producer guaranteed her that it would become \"a woman's song\", meaning that women will feel a special affinity for the song.<ref name=allmusicsaving/>\n\nAfter the success of her previous single, \"[[You Give Good Love]]\", the label initially didn't think about releasing \"Saving All My Love for You\" as the next single. When Masser heard that another single besides the song was being considered for the next single, he made a friendly wager with Davis during one of Houston's performance at [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|the Roxy Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]]. He proposed that if all the women get on their feet when Houston sings \"Saving...\", then Davis would agree that it should be the next single.<ref name=allmusicsaving/> Ultimately, the song was released as the second single in the [[United States]] and third single worldwide.\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"Saving All My Love for You\" is a [[soul music|soul]] and [[R&B]] song, composed in the key of [[A major]], having a slowly tempo of 84 beats per minute.

Houston's mother [[Cissy Houston]] didn't at all like the scenario described in the lyrics, claiming that the song's message would reflect badly on her daughter.

Louisiana]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Hans v. Louisiana|volume=134|page=1|pin=|year=1890}}.</ref> which had established the modern doctrine of sovereign immunity. The Court suggested that allowing Congress to abrogate sovereign immunity improperly expanded the jurisdiction of the federal courts beyond what [[Article Three of the U.S. Constitution]] permitted. The Eleventh Amendment, it contended, had further protected the states' sovereign immunity; the Fourteenth Amendment placed limitations on the Eleventh Amendment, but only with respect to the rights guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Court also found that the doctrine of ''Ex parte Young'' did not apply, invoking the rationale of an earlier case, ''[[Schweiker v.

Souter's dissent focuses on the language of the Eleventh Amendment, which only appears to eliminate [[diversity jurisdiction]] between states and citizens of ''other'' states. He rejects the \"critical errors\" in ''Hans'', which had read common law sovereign immunity to extend the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment to suits between states and their ''own'' citizens. Souter discounts the importance of the common law in interpreting the Constitution because the Constitution itself was such a new and unprecedented device at the time of its creation that it was clearly intended as a rejection of the common law that came before it. As support for this contention, Souter notes that the framers of the U.S. Constitution did not include language adopting the common law that had already been adopted by many of the states in their own constitutions. Souter also notes that Congress had rejected proposed language for the Eleventh Amendment which would clearly have barred suits between states and their own citizens, and which would clearly have prevented Congress from abrogating this bar.\n\nSouter also disagrees with the Court's rejection of ''Ex parte Young'', noting that where ''Chilicky'' was a rejection of the extra-statutory remedy proposed, ''Young'' was merely a jurisdictional device. Souter found it implausible that Congress would wish to see their statute made ''completely'' unenforceable simply because they had included a remedy for those injured by the failure of states to abide by it.\n\nJustice Stevens dissented separately, agreeing with the points raised in Souter's dissent, but adding some additional observations.

It changed hands repeatedly, passing between [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Hungarians]], [[Serbs]], and [[Austrians]], until 1867, when it was turned over to the Serbian [[Knez (title)|Knez]], [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 III, Prince of Serbia|Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 III]].

It is not uncommon name source in the Serbian [[toponymy]], but the exact reason for the fortress' name is not known and only the myths of the origin of the name exist. Some sources use the descriptive method, as the \"towers, like pigeons aim for the skies\". The most popular, but obviously also much later myth, is that of a beautiful Serbian girl named Golubana. A local Turkish [[pasha]] fell in love with her, but she loved a young Serbian man and rejected all the proposals and expensive gifts from the pasha. Angered, he took her down in a boat and either imprisoned her in the only cone-roofed tower, or tied her to the rock above the river and left her there until she died.<ref name=legende/>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe remains uncovered during the 2010s reconstruction, points to the Roman and Byzantine settlement which predated the fortress. The evidence was found in the typical brick-stone combination of construction, especially in the building which the Ottomans later used as a [[Turkish bath|hammam]].<ref name=legende/> Remains of the waterworks system were also discovered.<ref name=kapija/>\n\nGolubac's early history is uncertain. From 803 to 1018, the area belonged to the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], to the [[Byzantine Empire]] from then until 1193, and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] until 1257. The area remained in Serbian hands from then until the Ottoman conquest in the 15th century, with control of the region changing many times between Hungarians, Bulgarians and Serbs before then. It is also unclear whether the medieval fortress was built by Bulgarians, Serbs or Hungarians,<ref name=dons/><ref name=dejan>{{cite web | last = Ranisavljevi\u0107 | first = Dejan | title = Stari Grad Golubac | url = http://www.golubac.co.yu/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070307132644/http://www.golubac.co.yu/ | archivedate = 2007-03-07 | language = Serbian | accessdate = 2007-03-03}}</ref> or how many towers it had originally. However, an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[chapel]] built as part of one tower shows that it, at least, was built by a local noble. There is also uncertainty about when construction started, although it is generally agreed that the majority of the fortress was built early in the 14th century.<ref name=ntos/><ref name=YUTA/><ref name=beo/> The chapel probably originated from the period of Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=kapija/>\n\nSome of the proposed theories are those that Serbian king [[Stefan Dragutin]] built it in 1286 or that Hungarians built it soon after they conquered this part of the Brani\u010devo region from the Serbs a bit after this date. None can be confirmed by the historiography, but the discovery of the aforementioned Orthodox chapel might tentatively point to the Serbian origin of the fortress.<ref name=legende/>\n\n[[File:Dunav 063.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Main entrance and forward compound]]\n\nThe first known record of Golubac is in Hungarian sources from 1335, when it was occupied by Hungarian military.<ref name=dejan/><ref name=Politika/> It was described as the \"watcher made of stone, guarding the gorge\".<ref name=legende/> Sometime between 1345 and 1355, Serbian [[Tsar]] [[Stefan Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia|Stefan Du\u0161an]] toured the [[Brani\u010devo (region)|Brani\u010devo region]], which was part of Serbia along the boundary between Serbia and Hungary.

Between 1964\u201372, a [[hydroelectric]] dam was built in the [[Iron Gate (Danube)#Dam|Iron Gate gorge]], significantly elevating the river's water level.  As a result, the lower edge of the slope and corresponding parts of the fortress are now flooded.<ref name=ban/>\n\nFrom the beginning of the 21st century, much of the fort has been overgrown, making most of the sections higher on the hill inaccessible.  During the spring of 2005, a public project to restore the fort was started.  Most of the plants were removed and certain parts, like the fountain in the moat raised in honour of knight [[Zawisza Czarny]], were repaired.  The walls, towers and stone stairs are in good condition, but the wooden floors and steps have rotted out, making most of the upper floors impassable. Golubac has also gained popularity as a tourist attraction. Two key reasons are the major road that passes through it, and its proximity to [[Lepenski Vir]], making the two locales a touristic whole.\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n<!-- Unless specifically cited, this section is based on the Serbian Golubac page (which agrees with the cited parts). -->\nGolubac consists of three main [[compound (fortification)|compounds]] guarded by 9&nbsp;towers, 2&nbsp;[[portcullis]]es and a palace, all connected by fortress walls {{convert|2|to|3|m|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=dons/><ref name=beo/> In front of the fortress, the forward wall&nbsp;(I) doubled as the outer wall of the [[moat]],<ref name=beo/> which connected to the Danube and was likely filled with water.  A settlement for common people was situated in front of the wall.<ref name=dons/>\n\nAs is the case with many fortresses, Golubac's structure was modified over time. For years, there were only five towers. Later, four more were added.<ref name=dons/><ref name=smed>{{cite web|title=Monumental Heritage of the Smederevo and Brani\u010devo Region |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/smederevo/spomenici_e.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121221130432/http://www.rastko.org.rs/smederevo/spomenici_e.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-12-21 |year=2003 |work=Regional Institute for Protection of Cultural Monuments in Smederevo, Serbia |publisher=[[Project Rastko]] |accessdate=2007-03-29 }}</ref> The towers were all built as squares, a sign of the fortress' age, showing that battles were still fought with [[Cold weapon|cold steel]].

It includes the citadel (tower 1) and the [[Serbian Orthodox]] chapel (tower 4). Although it remains uncertain, the chapel has led many to believe that this section was built by a Serbian noble.\n\nLater, during either Serbian or Hungarian rule, the fortress was expanded to include the rear and forward compounds.\n\n=== Rear compound ===\n\nThe rear compound (D) is separated from the upper compound by both a wall connecting towers 2 and 4, and a steep rock {{convert|3|to|4|m|abbr=on}} high.  Next to tower 5 is a building&nbsp;(VII) which was probably used as a military barracks and for ammunition storage.\n\n=== Forward compound ===\n\nThe forward compound was split into lower&nbsp;(C) and upper&nbsp;(B) parts by a wall linking towers 4 and 7. The entrance&nbsp;(II) is in the lower part, guarded by towers 8 and 9.  Tower 8 has, in turn, been fortified with a cannon port. Opposing the entrance was a second portcullis that led to the rear compound. Along the path was a ditch {{convert|0.5|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|0.75|m|abbr=on}} deep which then became a steep decline. At the outer end of the lower part, and connected to the 9th&nbsp;tower with a low wall, is tower 10, which the Turks added to act as a lower artillery tower.  It controlled passage along the Danube and guarded the entrance to the [[harbour]]<!-- May well be [[port]] instead, it's not clear. -->, which was probably situated between towers 5 and 10. There are remains connected to tower 8 which probably formed a larger whole with it, but the lower part did not otherwise contain buildings.\n\nIn the wall that separated the upper and lower parts was a gate that led to the upper part. The upper part did not have buildings, but there remains a pathway to the stairs up to gate&nbsp;IV, which is {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} off the ground, right next to tower 3.\n\n=== Towers ===\n\nThe first nine towers are {{convert|20|to|25|m|abbr=on}} high.<ref name=dons/><ref name=beo/>  In all ten towers, the floors and stairs inside were made of wood, while external stairs were made of stone.

On the top floor is a [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] that overlooks the [[Danube]] and the entrance to the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate gorge]].  Down the slope from tower 3 is tower 4, which also has a square base. The ground floor has a Serbian Orthodox chapel that was built into the tower, rather than being added later.  The last tower along this wall, tower 5, is the only tower to remain completely square. All towers were originally rectangular, but the Ottomans upgraded them and additionally fortified them against the artillery.<ref name=Politika/>\n\nThe top tower along the front wall of the forward compound, tower 6, has a square base which was reinforced with a six-sided foundation. Working west, the square base of tower 7 was reinforced with a circular foundation. Tower 8, on the upper side of the front portcullis, has an irregular, but generally square, base. It is also the shortest of the first nine towers. Guarding the other side is tower 9, which has a square base reinforced by an eight-sided foundation.\n\nThe last tower is the cannon tower. It has only one floor and is the shortest of all ten towers. It was built with an eight-sided base and cannon ports to help control traffic on the Danube. Tower 10 is almost identical to the three artillery towers added to [[Smederevo fortress]]. The cannon tower is also the youngest. It used to be on dry land, but with the formation of the artificial [[Lake \u0110erdap]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the water level rose so today it protrudes into the Danube. It is also called the White Tower.<ref name=Politika/>\n\n== 2014-2019 reconstruction ==\n[[File:Panorama Goluba\u010dke tvr\u0111ave.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Reconstruction of the fortress 2017]]\n\nThe area surrounding the fortress was declared a touristic area by the government in 2011, covering {{convert|23|ha|abbr=on}}, within the [[\u0110erdap national park]]. The Government of the [[Republic of Serbia]] has applied to the reconstruction project fortress Blace with IPA funds of the [[European Union]] in the framework of the international project \"Cultural Route - Fortresses on the Danube\". The funds were provided through these funds in the amount of \u20ac6.5 million in 2011 and \u20ac2.1 million in 2016.<ref name=Politika/> Preliminary reconstruction project is work of architect Marina Jovin, professional consultants on the project were Sini\u0161a Temerinski and archaeologist Dr Miomir Kora\u0107.\n\nBecause of decades of neglect, harsh working conditions, discrepancy between the projected solutions and the existing situation and a fact that heavy traffic was passing right through the fortress, the works dragged on. Projected to last three years, the rebuilding which began in the summer of 2014 is, as of February 2018, still ongoing. In July 2017, a tunnel was open which redirected the traffic, which passed through since the 1930s, out of the fortress and the reconstruction area. The {{convert|152|m|abbr=on}} long tunnel and {{convert|700|m|abbr=on}} were constructed for 2 years, using the specifically controlled explosion in order not to damage the fortress.<ref name=Politika/>\n\nTraditional materials (stone) and techniques (manual treatment) are used.

Its placement at the head of the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]] gorge allowed for easy control of river traffic.<ref name=dons/><ref name=beo/> It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman-held.<ref name=varna/> The importance of the fortress is further indicated by the attention it received from [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] and [[Murad II]], rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities. The Golubac Fortress was declared a [[Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance]] in 1979, and it is protected by the [[Republic of Serbia]].\n\nWith the [[Belgrade fortress]], it is today the only [[cultural monument]] in Serbia which has its own administration - a state company founded specifically for handling the fortress.<ref name=Politika/>\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Golubac grad 2019 08.jpg|thumb|Golubac Fortress after reconstruction, July 2019]]\n\nThe partially renovated fortress was officially open for tourists in the autumn of 2016 and had 63,000 visitors in 2017 despite there is nothing more to see in the fortress except from the view and the small exhibition \"Panorama through the centuries\", so the administration expected no more than 10,000 visitors. Almost one third, 20.000, were foreign tourists. Two piers, one larger and other smaller, are placed in the Danube, but the touristic boats were not allowed to dock until the fortress was officially declared a port area in April 2018, when the international [[cruise ships]] began to dock. Also, there are plans for bringing the model cannons into the cannon tower.<ref name=legende/><ref name=Politika/>\n\nIn April 2018, four towers were planned to be open for public, 6, 7, 8 and 10, or the cannon tower, but the deadline was extended to the end of the year. The tower 8 will host a three-floor exhibition dedicated to the knights, with a section devoted to the Polish knight Zawisza Czarny. Plans include the joining of the attractions in the vicinity, like \u0110erdap national park and prehistoric site [[Lepenski Vir]], in one tourist arrangement.<ref name=legende/><ref name=Politika/>\n\nAs number of visitors grew significantly since the full re-opening of the fortress, various works are planned in the surrounding area to the west, in the direction of the modern town of Golubac. They include new restaurants, [[Pension (lodging)|pension-type facilities]], new roads, bicycle and pedestrian paths and arrangement of the touristic settlement Dedinski Raj (\"Golubac's [[Dedinje]]\"), between the town and the fortress. Also, the beach will be adapted along the Danube's bank.<ref>{{cite news | author = Mirjana Niki\u0107 | script-title=sr: \u041e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043f\u0446\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u045a\u0443 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0437\u0430 | trans-title = Restoration of Golubac prompted construction of the beach and paths | newspaper = Politika-Moja ku\u0107a | page = 1 | language = Serbian | date = 27 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Serbia}}\n{{commons category|Golubac Fortress}}\n*[[Vr\u0161ac Castle]]\n*[[List of fortresses in Serbia]]\n*[[Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance]]\n*[[Tourism in Serbia]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n*The information in the ''Architecture'' and ''In recent years'' sections is from the [[:sr:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434|Serbian page]].\n*Uncited information in the remaining sections is from either the [[:sr:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434|Serbian page]] or the [[:de:Golubac|German page]], and much of it overlapped.\n**The main author of the Serbian page said it is based on ''[[Aleksandar Deroko]], \"Srednjevekovni gradovi u Srbiji, Crnoj Gori i Makedoniji\", Belgrade 1950'' and ''Aleksandar Deroko, \"Medieval Castles on the Danube\", Belgrade 1964''.\n**The [[:de:Benutzer:Carski|main author]] of the German<!-- No, NOT a typo. --> page said it is based on ''Istorija srpskog naroda (u \u0161est knjiga), druga knjiga; Srpska knji\u017eevna zadruga, drugo izdanje, Beograd 1994 (History of the Serbs (in six books), second book; Serbian authors society, second edition, Belgrade 1994)'', which is a different edition of the book in citation<ref name=rastko/> below.\n<!-- *[http://www.mimi.hu/tortenelem1/galamboc.html Galamboc] {{hu icon}} - Might be a repeat of already sourced info. -->\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Cultural Heritage of Exceptional Importance}}\n{{Good article}}\n\n[[Category:14th-century establishments in Serbia]]\n[[Category:1480s establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Forts in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Tourism in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Architecture of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)]]\n[[Category:Ruins in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Danube]]\n[[Category:Medieval sites in Serbia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military installation\n|name=Golubac Fortress\n|location=[[Golubac]], [[Serbia]] \n|coordinates = {{coord|44.660717|21.677914|type:landmark|display=inline}}\n|image=Golubac_Fortress_(27379120351).jpg\n|caption=Golubac Fortress\n|map_type=Serbia\n|map_size=200\n|type=[[Fortification]], mixed\n|built=14th century\n|builder=\n|materials=Stone\n|height=\n|used=\n|condition= \n|ownership=\n|open_to_public= Yes\n}}\n\nThe '''Golubac Fortress''' ({{lang-sr|\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434}} or ''Goluba\u010dki grad'', {{lang-hu|Galamb\u00f3c v\u00e1ra}}, {{lang-bg|\u0413\u044a\u043b\u044a\u0431\u0435\u0446}}, {{lang-ro|Cetatea Golub\u0103\u021b}}, {{lang-tr|G\u00fcvercinlik Kalesi}}) was a [[medieval]] [[Fortification|fortified]] town on the south side of the [[Danube]] River, {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} downstream from the modern-day town of [[Golubac]], [[Serbia]].

The area remained in Serbian hands from then until the Ottoman conquest in the 15th century, with control of the region changing many times between Hungarians, Bulgarians and Serbs before then.

This road is the shortest link between Serbia and eastern parts of the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]].

As a result, the lower edge of the slope and corresponding parts of the fortress are now flooded.<ref name=ban/>\n\nFrom the beginning of the 21st century, much of the fort has been overgrown, making most of the sections higher on the hill inaccessible.  During the spring of 2005, a public project to restore the fort was started.  Most of the plants were removed and certain parts, like the fountain in the moat raised in honour of knight [[Zawisza Czarny]], were repaired.  The walls, towers and stone stairs are in good condition, but the wooden floors and steps have rotted out, making most of the upper floors impassable. Golubac has also gained popularity as a tourist attraction. Two key reasons are the major road that passes through it, and its proximity to [[Lepenski Vir]], making the two locales a touristic whole.\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n<!-- Unless specifically cited, this section is based on the Serbian Golubac page (which agrees with the cited parts). -->\nGolubac consists of three main [[compound (fortification)|compounds]] guarded by 9&nbsp;towers, 2&nbsp;[[portcullis]]es and a palace, all connected by fortress walls {{convert|2|to|3|m|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=dons/><ref name=beo/> In front of the fortress, the forward wall&nbsp;(I) doubled as the outer wall of the [[moat]],<ref name=beo/> which connected to the Danube and was likely filled with water.

It includes the citadel (tower 1) and the [[Serbian Orthodox]] chapel (tower 4). Although it remains uncertain, the chapel has led many to believe that this section was built by a Serbian noble.\n\nLater, during either Serbian or Hungarian rule, the fortress was expanded to include the rear and forward compounds.\n\n=== Rear compound ===\n\nThe rear compound (D) is separated from the upper compound by both a wall connecting towers 2 and 4, and a steep rock {{convert|3|to|4|m|abbr=on}} high.  Next to tower 5 is a building&nbsp;(VII) which was probably used as a military barracks and for ammunition storage.\n\n=== Forward compound ===\n\nThe forward compound was split into lower&nbsp;(C) and upper&nbsp;(B) parts by a wall linking towers 4 and 7. The entrance&nbsp;(II) is in the lower part, guarded by towers 8 and 9.  Tower 8 has, in turn, been fortified with a cannon port. Opposing the entrance was a second portcullis that led to the rear compound. Along the path was a ditch {{convert|0.5|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|0.75|m|abbr=on}} deep which then became a steep decline. At the outer end of the lower part, and connected to the 9th&nbsp;tower with a low wall, is tower 10, which the Turks added to act as a lower artillery tower.  It controlled passage along the Danube and guarded the entrance to the [[harbour]]<!-- May well be [[port]] instead, it's not clear. -->, which was probably situated between towers 5 and 10. There are remains connected to tower 8 which probably formed a larger whole with it, but the lower part did not otherwise contain buildings.\n\nIn the wall that separated the upper and lower parts was a gate that led to the upper part. The upper part did not have buildings, but there remains a pathway to the stairs up to gate&nbsp;IV, which is {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} off the ground, right next to tower 3.\n\n=== Towers ===\n\nThe first nine towers are {{convert|20|to|25|m|abbr=on}} high.<ref name=dons/><ref name=beo/>  In all ten towers, the floors and stairs inside were made of wood, while external stairs were made of stone.

Down the slope from tower 3 is tower 4, which also has a square base. The ground floor has a Serbian Orthodox chapel that was built into the tower, rather than being added later.  The last tower along this wall, tower 5, is the only tower to remain completely square. All towers were originally rectangular, but the Ottomans upgraded them and additionally fortified them against the artillery.<ref name=Politika/>\n\nThe top tower along the front wall of the forward compound, tower 6, has a square base which was reinforced with a six-sided foundation. Working west, the square base of tower 7 was reinforced with a circular foundation. Tower 8, on the upper side of the front portcullis, has an irregular, but generally square, base. It is also the shortest of the first nine towers. Guarding the other side is tower 9, which has a square base reinforced by an eight-sided foundation.\n\nThe last tower is the cannon tower. It has only one floor and is the shortest of all ten towers. It was built with an eight-sided base and cannon ports to help control traffic on the Danube. Tower 10 is almost identical to the three artillery towers added to [[Smederevo fortress]]. The cannon tower is also the youngest. It used to be on dry land, but with the formation of the artificial [[Lake \u0110erdap]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the water level rose so today it protrudes into the Danube.

The Government of the [[Republic of Serbia]] has applied to the reconstruction project fortress Blace with IPA funds of the [[European Union]] in the framework of the international project \"Cultural Route - Fortresses on the Danube\". The funds were provided through these funds in the amount of \u20ac6.5 million in 2011 and \u20ac2.1 million in 2016.<ref name=Politika/> Preliminary reconstruction project is work of architect Marina Jovin, professional consultants on the project were Sini\u0161a Temerinski and archaeologist Dr Miomir Kora\u0107.\n\nBecause of decades of neglect, harsh working conditions, discrepancy between the projected solutions and the existing situation and a fact that heavy traffic was passing right through the fortress, the works dragged on. Projected to last three years, the rebuilding which began in the summer of 2014 is, as of February 2018, still ongoing. In July 2017, a tunnel was open which redirected the traffic, which passed through since the 1930s, out of the fortress and the reconstruction area.

Its placement at the head of the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]] gorge allowed for easy control of river traffic.<ref name=dons/><ref name=beo/> It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman-held.<ref name=varna/> The importance of the fortress is further indicated by the attention it received from [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] and [[Murad II]], rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities. The Golubac Fortress was declared a [[Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance]] in 1979, and it is protected by the [[Republic of Serbia]].\n\nWith the [[Belgrade fortress]], it is today the only [[cultural monument]] in Serbia which has its own administration - a state company founded specifically for handling the fortress.<ref name=Politika/>\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Golubac grad 2019 08.jpg|thumb|Golubac Fortress after reconstruction, July 2019]]\n\nThe partially renovated fortress was officially open for tourists in the autumn of 2016 and had 63,000 visitors in 2017 despite there is nothing more to see in the fortress except from the view and the small exhibition \"Panorama through the centuries\", so the administration expected no more than 10,000 visitors. Almost one third, 20.000, were foreign tourists. Two piers, one larger and other smaller, are placed in the Danube, but the touristic boats were not allowed to dock until the fortress was officially declared a port area in April 2018, when the international [[cruise ships]] began to dock. Also, there are plans for bringing the model cannons into the cannon tower.<ref name=legende/><ref name=Politika/>\n\nIn April 2018, four towers were planned to be open for public, 6, 7, 8 and 10, or the cannon tower, but the deadline was extended to the end of the year. The tower 8 will host a three-floor exhibition dedicated to the knights, with a section devoted to the Polish knight Zawisza Czarny.

They include new restaurants, [[Pension (lodging)|pension-type facilities]], new roads, bicycle and pedestrian paths and arrangement of the touristic settlement Dedinski Raj (\"Golubac's [[Dedinje]]\"), between the town and the fortress.

He plays and sings with the band Cran, and also played in a 40-year duet with [[Peadar O'Loughlin|Peter O'Loughlin]]. He was the original piper with both ''[[Riverdance]]'' and the [[Afro Celt Sound System]].\n\nBrowne has also contributed music to the film soundtracks of ''[[Circle of Friends (1995 film)|Circle of Friends]]'',  ''[[Rob Roy (1995 film)|Rob Roy]]'', ''[[Robin of Locksley (film)|Robin of Locksley]]'', ''[[The Secret of Roan Inish]]'', ''[[Streets of Gold]]'', ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', and the TV series ''[[Bringing It All Back Home (TV Series)|Bringing It All Back Home]]''.\n\n==Early years==\nBrowne was born in [[Dublin]] in 1965 into a musical background.  His grandmother, [[Delia Murphy]], wrote, recorded and popularised many Irish songs in the 1930s and 1940s. Musicians such as [[S\u00e9amus Ennis]], [[Willie Clancy (musician)|Willie Clancy]] and [[Denis Murphy (Irish musician)|Denis Murphy]] were regular visitors to Browne's family home over the years. He began playing the pipes at the age of seven, his main influences being pipers [[Willie Clancy (musician)|Willie Clancy]], [[Johnny Doran]] and [[S\u00e9amus Ennis]], and fiddlers [[Denis Murphy (Irish musician)|Denis Murphy]] and [[Tommy Potts]].\n\n==Career==\nBrowne has toured extensively in Europe and in the US, as well as playing in Russia, India, Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Japan.  He gives master classes throughout the world.\n\nHe has been involved in many album recordings since his first venture into the studio in 1982 and has collaborated with many of the top artists playing [[traditional Irish music]], classical, pop, [[jazz]] and [[Country music|Country]].  These include people such as [[An\u00fana]], [[D\u00f3nal Lunny]], [[Finbar Wright]], [[Alan Stivell]], [[Indigo Girls|The Indigo Girls]], Tommy Hayes, [[Sean Tyrrell]], [[Bill Whelan]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Nightnoise]], [[Michael Kamen]], [[Paul Brady]], [[Bill Laswell]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Deep Forest]].\n\nAfter releasing the easy-listening album ''Celtic Moods'' in 1997, Browne released a solo traditional CD ''The Wynd You Know'' in 2001, with [[Claddagh Records]].\n\n===Duet with Peter O'Loughlin===\nBrowne's friendship and musical collaboration with Peter O'Loughlin spanned the 40 years from their initial meeting in 1977 to Peter's death on 22 October 2017. Their strong combination of mid-19th century flat-pitch pipes and tuned-down fiddle, playing the old dance music of Ireland, makes for a rare and thoroughly enjoyable evening's entertainment. They recorded 3 albums: 'The South West Wind' (1988), '''Touch Me if You Dare' (2002), and 'The Legacy (2016).''\n\n===Cran===\nBrowne is a member of the group Cran with Se\u00e1n Corcoran and Desi Wilkinson.  Cran has released five CDs and tour worldwide.\nThe core of their repertoire is native Irish material \u2013 dance music or slow airs on flute and [[Uilleann pipes|pipes]], and vocals ranging from the highly ornamented sean-n\u00f3s songs of [[Conamara]] to the rollicking port a' bh\u00e9il or mouth music of [[County Donegal|Donegal]]. Their Hiberno-English song repertoire (songs from Ireland in English) covers the entire gamut from the old story-telling \"long ballads\" to lively comic songs of \"pure divilment and rascality\". They also include material from the related Scots-Gaelic tradition and from the other Atlantic Celts, the Bretons.\n\nCran have released five CDs: [The Crooked Stair (1993, reissued 2005); Black Black Black (1998); Lover\u2019s Ghost (2000); Music from the Edge of the World (2002); Dally and Stray (2014)].\n\nSince their teens, Browne and fiddle player Kevin Glackin have played as a duet.  Kevin, regularly joins Cran for recordings along with [[Tr\u00edona N\u00ed Dhomhnaill]] ([[Bothy Band]]).\n\n===''Riverdance''===\nBrowne was the original piper for the Eurovision interval performance of Riverdance in 1994 and his recording has featured in almost every show since.  He chose not to join the teeming cast when the show went on the road, preferring instead to concentrate on his personal projects and to leave the touring to pipers with more time on their hands.\n\n===Afro Celt Sound System===\nIn the mid-1990s, Browne was asked if he would like to join a project which was starting up revolving around Peter Gabriel's 2nd \"World Music Recording Week\".  Musicians converged from all over the planet to ramble from project to project being recorded in up 7 recording setups in Real World Studios.  Out of this intense meeting of musicians was born the Afro Celt Sound System which went on to become Real World's most successful venture.  It was a meeting of African and Irish musicians in the convivial company of some of the top London programmers.\n\nThe Afro Celts toured the world and Browne remained with the band for the first two albums, writing and recording in various locations between Ireland and England.  Tracks were licensed for countless documentaries, ads and films, the strangest of which was Farrah Fawcett sculpting nude in a Playboy video to the sound of Browne's opening track on the 1st Afro Celt CD.\n\n===Performances===\nBrowne has played many prestigious concerts in Ireland and abroad as a solo musician and has also been a guest member to a wide variety of groups.\n\nAlthough best known as a traditional musician, Browne is also keenly interested in exploring other musical genres particularly in film and television. He has written and performed music for fashion shows in London and Paris by designers [[Lainey Keogh]] and [[John Rocha]].\n\n===Teaching===\nBrowne has been teaching the pipes, flute and whistle worldwide for the last 25 years and has recently developed a much sought-after music appreciation/listening class.  In 2005 an Arts Council DEIS grant enabled him to make his class completely portable and has proved a huge addition to his teaching capabilities.\n\n===Film Music and Television===\nAlong with [[Michael Kamen]], Browne composed the soundtrack for the documentary film ''[[The Dolphin's Gift]]'', directed by [[Kim Kindersley]].  More recently, the two of them collaborated on the score to ''[[Circle of Friends (1995 film)|Circle of Friends]]'', the film dramatisation of [[Maeve Binchy]]'s novel.\n\nBrowne has also contributed music to the film soundtracks of ''[[Robin of Lcksley (film)|Robin of Lcksley]]'', ''[[Rob Roy (1995 film)|Rob Roy]]'', ''[[Fierce Creatures]]'', ''[[The Secret of Roan Inish]]'', ''[[Streets of Gold]]'' and ''[[Gangs of New York]]''.\n\nOn [[Anjelica Huston]]'s ''[[Mrs. Browne]]'', Browne was Traditional Irish Music Director.\n\nHe composed and recorded scores for the audio-visual displays at the National 1798 Visitor Centre in Enniscorthy, at the Waterford Treasures museum and at King John's Castle in Limerick city.\n\n[[TG4]], the Irish TV station, commissioned Browne to write the music for the daily news program ''[[Nuacht]]'', a six-part drama series ''[[Geibheann]]'' and the drama ''[[An Gaeilgeoir Nocht]]''. Browne appears regularly on Irish music and magazine programmes on national television and radio.  He has also played for numerous television advertisements.\n\nHe appeared on ABC Network's 65 million-audience ''[[Good Morning America]]'' playing the [[Uilleann Pipes]] with [[D\u00f3nal Lunny]], [[Nollaig Casey]] and [[Arty McGlynn]].  He played on the theme music to the six-part series ''[[Bringing It All Back Home (TV series)|Bringing It All Back Home]]'' \u2013 an independent television programme dealing with the influence of Irish music on American folk and contemporary music.\n\nBrowne featured on Hummingbird's ''[[Rivers of Sound]]'', which explored many aspects of traditional Irish music.\n\n===Theatre===\nBrowne worked with Tommy Hayes, on the writing and performance of music for the [[Abbey Theatre]] productions of ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]''.  He joined forces again with Tommy and dancer Cindy Cummings to give off-beat improvised performances.\n\nThe Olympia Theatre performance of ''[[The Tailor and Ansty]]'' with [[Anna Manahan]] and [[Frank Kelly]] saw Browne playing music and acting a small role.\n\nBrowne's version of the [[Blasket Island]] air ''[[Port na bPuca\u00ed]]'' was chosen by Limerick's [[Daghda dance group]] for their part in the huge [[Famine]] commemoration held in [[Millstreet]] in 1997.\n\n==Selected discography==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Solo===\n* ''Celtic Moods'' (1997) \n* ''The Wynd You Know'' (2001) \u2013 Traditional pipes solo CD\n* ''Salute to the Brave'' (2005) \u2013 with the Patriot Corps\n\n===With Cran===\n* ''The Crooked Stair'' (1995/2006)\n* ''Black, Black, Black'' (1998) \u2013 with Shel Talmy\n* ''Lover's Ghost'' (2000)\n* ''Music from the Edge of the World'' (2003)\n* ''Dally And Stray'' (2014)\n\n===With Peter O'Loughlin===\n* ''The South West Wind'' (1988)\n* ''Touch me if you Dare'' (2002)\n* ''The Thing Itself'' (2004) \u2013 with [[Maeve Donnelly]]\n* ''Geantra\u00ed'' (2006) \u2013 TV performance (CD & DVD) \n* ''The Legacy'' (2015)\n\n===With Afro Celt Sound System===\n* ''[[Volume 1: Sound Magic]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[Volume 2: Release]]'' (1999)\n* ''Capture 1995-2010'' (2010)\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n===With Transatlantic Sessions===\n* ''[[Transatlantic Sessions|Transatlantic Sessions 2]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Transatlantic Sessions|Transatlantic Sessions 3]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Transatlantic Sessions|Transatlantic Sessions 4]]'' (2009)\n\n===With others===\n* ''Taobh na Greine/Under the Sun'' (1994) \u2013 with [[Seosaimh\u00edn N\u00ed Bheaglaoich]] and [[D\u00f3nal Lunny]] \n* ''Branohm/The Voyage of Bran'' (1994) \u2013 with [[Maire Breathnach]]\n* ''[[Riverdance: Music from the Show]]'' (1995)\n* ''Secret of Roan Inish'' (1995) \u2013 soundtrack to the film\n* ''River of Sound'' (1995) \u2013 Accompanying the TV series\n* ''[[When I Was Young (album)|When I Was Young]]'' (1996) \u2013 with [[P\u00e1draig\u00edn N\u00ed Uallach\u00e1in]] & [[Len Graham (singer)|Len Graham]]\n* ''Celtic Tenors'' (1998) \u2013 Volume 1\n* ''The Crossing'' (1999) \u2013 with [[Tim O'Brien (musician)|Tim O'Brien]]\n* ''Celtic Tenors'' (2000)  \u2013 Volume 2\n* ''Journey \u2013 Best of [[D\u00f3nal Lunny]]'' (2001)\n* ''The Irish Tenors'' (2001) \u2013 Ellis Island Guest\n* ''Celtic Tenors'' (2002)  \u2013 Volume 3 (So Strong: \"Pipes on The Green Fields Of France\" and \"Mull of Kintyre\")\n* ''Celtic Tiger'' (2005)  \u2013 Soundtrack to [[Michael Flatley|Flatley]]'s show\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cranmusic.com Official CRAN Website]\n*[http://www.rocketbaby.net/interviews_ronan_browne.html Ronan Browne Interview]\n* Varlet, Philippe.

The crash was caused by an error by the pilot, who misestimated the altitude during low-flight manoeuvres, and by muggy weather, which complicated the detection of a water surface. The depth of the crash site was only about 1 metre, which helped to absorb the shock but was too shallow for the pilot to drown. The pilot survived with head injuries.

The crash was caused by an error by the pilot, who misestimated the altitude during low-flight manoeuvres, and by muggy weather, which complicated the detection of a water surface. The depth of the crash site was only about 1 metre, which helped to absorb the shock but was too shallow for the pilot to drown. The pilot survived with head injuries.

Like the previous ''[[Shenmue]]''  games, it consists of [[open-world]] environments interspersed with [[Beat 'em up|brawler]] battles and [[quick time event]]s. It features a [[Persistent world|day-and-night system]], variable weather effects, [[non-player character]]s with daily schedules, and various [[minigame]]s. The story continues teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki's quest to find his father's killer in the mountains of 1980s [[Guilin]], China.\n\nDirector [[Yu Suzuki]] conceived ''Shenmue'' as a saga spanning multiple games. The first two games were developed by [[Sega AM2]] and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Dreamcast]] in 1999 and 2001. The original ''[[Shenmue (video game)|Shenmue]]'' was the [[List of most expensive video games to develop|most expensive video game ever developed]] at the time, with an estimated production and marketing cost of over US$47 million, though this also covered some of ''[[Shenmue II]]'' and groundwork for future ''Shenmue'' games. Despite attracting a [[cult following]], the games were commercial failures.\n\nDuring [[E3 2015]], following years of speculation, Suzuki launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to [[crowdfund]] ''Shenmue III'', with Sega having licensed ''Shenmue'' to Suzuki's company Ys Net. It became the fastest campaign to raise $2 million, in under seven hours, and ended the following month having raised over $6 million, making it the [[Crowdfunding in video games|highest-funded video game]] and the [[List of highest-funded crowdfunding projects|sixth-highest-funded campaign in Kickstarter history]]. Further funding came from Sony and Deep Silver and crowdfunding on other platforms. The development team was much smaller than that of previous games, though key staff from the original ''Shenmue'' team returned. The game was built using [[Unreal Engine 4]].\n\n''Shenmue III'' was released on November 19, 2019, 18 years after ''Shenmue II''. It received mixed reviews, with critics divided over its similarity to its predecessors; some described it as outdated, while others praised its faithfulness to the franchise. Retail sales were low, but exclude copies sent to Kickstarter backers.\n\n==Gameplay==\nLike the previous ''[[Shenmue]]'' games, the player controls teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki, who is searching for his father's killer. Most of the game is spent exploring the [[open world]] in [[Guilin]], China, searching for clues, examining objects and talking to [[non-player character]]s for information.<ref name=\":15\" /> The game features a 3D fighting system similar to the ''[[Virtua Fighter]]'' series; Ryo can practice moves to increase their power.<ref name=\":15\" /> In quick time events, the player must press the right buttons at the right moment to succeed.<ref name=\":16\" /> Ryo can earn money through [[minigame]]s such as gambling, fishing, woodchopping, and forklift driving, and by selling foraged herbs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/best-way-to-make-shenmue-3-money-quick-fast-easy-yuan/|title=Make it rain Yuan with these Shenmue 3 money-making tips|last=Bartlett|first=Liam|date=2019-11-22|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191123190123/https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/best-way-to-make-shenmue-3-money-quick-fast-easy-yuan/|archive-date=November 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Shenmue III'' introduces a stamina system, whereby Ryo's [[hit points]] (HP) gradually decline as the player explores. If his HP drops too low, he loses the ability to sprint while exploring. Ryo can restore HP through sleeping and eating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-23-shenmue-3-food-6078|title=Shenmue 3 food explained: Best food to buy, how to eat food, and stamina regeneration explained|last=Reynolds|first=Matthew|date=2019-11-23|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219194531/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-23-shenmue-3-food-6078|archive-date=December 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1987, teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki has journeyed from [[Yokosuka]], Japan, to the mountains of [[Guilin]], China, in search of his father's killer, Lan Di. Ryo and his new friend, Ling Shenhua, search for Shenhua's missing father, stonemason Yuan, in Shenhua's hometown of Bailu Village. They learn that thugs have been harassing the local stonemasons, looking for the phoenix mirror, which Ryo has brought from his father's [[D\u014dj\u014d|dojo]]. Another stonemason, Xu, is also missing. Ryo defeats two of the thugs, but is defeated by their boss, Yanlang.\n\nRyo learns that Lan Di's father, Sunming Zhao, visited Bailu Village with Ryo's father to train under the local grandmaster. Zhao died under mysterious circumstances several years later. Ryo also discovers that the phoenix and dragon mirrors were created by Yuan's grandfather at the request of the Chinese emperor. Their creation is connected to the local Verdant Bridge, constructed to honor the visit of a Chinese envoy.\n\nAt the thugs' hideout, Ryo is defeated again by Yanlang. He convinces Sun, a local martial arts master, to teach him a powerful [[Bajiquan]] move, and uses it to defeat Yanlang. A village elder helps them discover a map to the treasure connected to the mirrors. Ryo fends off an attack from Lan Di's henchman Chai, who reveals that Yuan and Xu have been taken to the city of Niaowu.\n\nRyo and Shenhua travel to Niaowu by boat. Ryo learns that a local gang, the Red Snakes, is holding Yuan and Xu. Ryo encounters his Hong Kong ally, Wuying Ren, who has traveled to Niaowu in pursuit of the treasure connected to the mirrors. At the Red Snakes\u2019 hideout, Ryo and Ren are defeated by their boss, Ge, who uses an animalistic fighting style. Ryo meets a cormorant fisherman, Grandmaster Bei, who teaches him a similar Bajiquan move.\n\nRyo and Ren approach the hideout, only to find Li Feng, a mysterious woman whom Ryo has enountered in Niaowu. She tells them that the Red Snakes have kidnapped Shenhua and taken her across the river to a castle. Ryo convinces Bei to take him and Ren by boat. Before departing, Ren reveals that he has acquired a counterfeit phoenix mirror, believing it could be useful.\n\nThe three cross the river with Hsu, a former student of Bei, and Lin Shiling, the maiden of a local shrine. Ryo and Ren infiltrate the castle while the others guard the perimeter. Ryo finds Yuan and Xu trapped in a cell; Ryo defeats Chai again and releases them. They encounter a Chi You Men leader, Niao Sun, Li Feng's true identity. Ryo gives her the real phoenix mirror to save Shenhua, and Niao Sun tells them Lan Di is up ahead.\n\nRyo and Ren fight their way to the top of the castle, defeat Ge, and find Lan Di. Ryo challenges him to a fight, but Lan Di defeats him easily. Ren offers Lan Di the counterfeit phoenix mirror in exchange for Ryo's life. Lan Di accepts, but Ren hurls the mirror out of a window. Niao Sun has her men burn the castle to kill Lan Di and consolidate her power, and Ryo and Ren escape.\n\nRyo, Shenhua, Ren, Yuan, and Xu depart Niaowu by boat. On board, Yuan reveals that the mirrors were initially locked away in a cliff temple; Zhao Sunming retrieved them to keep them from \"falling into the wrong hands\". After Zhao died, his son, Lan Di, was raised by the Chi You Men. While captive, Yuan also learned that the Chi You have taken over the cliff temple. Ryo, Shenhua, and Ren continue their journey along the [[Great Wall of China]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Yu Suzuki - Game Developers Conference 2011 - Day 3 (2).jpg|thumb|''Shenmue'' creator Yu Suzuki speaking at the 2011 Game Developers Conference|alt=A 2011 photograph of Yu Suzuki]]{{See also|Shenmue III#Development}}The first two [[Shenmue|''Shenmue'' games]] were directed, written and produced by [[Yu Suzuki]], developed by [[Sega AM2]], and published by Sega for the [[Dreamcast]] in 1999 and 2001 respectively.

Like the previous ''[[Shenmue]]''  games, it consists of [[open-world]] environments interspersed with [[Beat 'em up|brawler]] battles and [[quick time event]]s. It features a [[Persistent world|day-and-night system]], variable weather effects, [[non-player character]]s with daily schedules, and various [[minigame]]s. The story continues teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki's quest to find his father's killer in the mountains of 1980s [[Guilin]], China.\n\nDirector [[Yu Suzuki]] conceived ''Shenmue'' as a saga spanning multiple games. The first two games were developed by [[Sega AM2]] and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Dreamcast]] in 1999 and 2001. The original ''[[Shenmue (video game)|Shenmue]]'' was the [[List of most expensive video games to develop|most expensive video game ever developed]] at the time, with an estimated production and marketing cost of over US$47 million, though this also covered some of ''[[Shenmue II]]'' and groundwork for future ''Shenmue'' games. Despite attracting a [[cult following]], the games were commercial failures.\n\nDuring [[E3 2015]], following years of speculation, Suzuki launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to [[crowdfund]] ''Shenmue III'', with Sega having licensed ''Shenmue'' to Suzuki's company Ys Net. It became the fastest campaign to raise $2 million, in under seven hours, and ended the following month having raised over $6 million, making it the [[Crowdfunding in video games|highest-funded video game]] and the [[List of highest-funded crowdfunding projects|sixth-highest-funded campaign in Kickstarter history]]. Further funding came from Sony and Deep Silver and crowdfunding on other platforms. The development team was much smaller than that of previous games, though key staff from the original ''Shenmue'' team returned. The game was built using [[Unreal Engine 4]].\n\n''Shenmue III'' was released on November 19, 2019, 18 years after ''Shenmue II''. It received mixed reviews, with critics divided over its similarity to its predecessors; some described it as outdated, while others praised its faithfulness to the franchise. Retail sales were low, but exclude copies sent to Kickstarter backers.\n\n==Gameplay==\nLike the previous ''[[Shenmue]]'' games, the player controls teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki, who is searching for his father's killer. Most of the game is spent exploring the [[open world]] in [[Guilin]], China, searching for clues, examining objects and talking to [[non-player character]]s for information.<ref name=\":15\" /> The game features a 3D fighting system similar to the ''[[Virtua Fighter]]'' series; Ryo can practice moves to increase their power.<ref name=\":15\" /> In quick time events, the player must press the right buttons at the right moment to succeed.<ref name=\":16\" /> Ryo can earn money through [[minigame]]s such as gambling, fishing, woodchopping, and forklift driving, and by selling foraged herbs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/best-way-to-make-shenmue-3-money-quick-fast-easy-yuan/|title=Make it rain Yuan with these Shenmue 3 money-making tips|last=Bartlett|first=Liam|date=2019-11-22|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191123190123/https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/best-way-to-make-shenmue-3-money-quick-fast-easy-yuan/|archive-date=November 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Shenmue III'' introduces a stamina system, whereby Ryo's [[hit points]] (HP) gradually decline as the player explores. If his HP drops too low, he loses the ability to sprint while exploring. Ryo can restore HP through sleeping and eating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-23-shenmue-3-food-6078|title=Shenmue 3 food explained: Best food to buy, how to eat food, and stamina regeneration explained|last=Reynolds|first=Matthew|date=2019-11-23|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219194531/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-23-shenmue-3-food-6078|archive-date=December 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1987, teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki has journeyed from [[Yokosuka]], Japan, to the mountains of [[Guilin]], China, in search of his father's killer, Lan Di. Ryo and his new friend, Ling Shenhua, search for Shenhua's missing father, stonemason Yuan, in Shenhua's hometown of Bailu Village. They learn that thugs have been harassing the local stonemasons, looking for the phoenix mirror, which Ryo has brought from his father's [[D\u014dj\u014d|dojo]]. Another stonemason, Xu, is also missing. Ryo defeats two of the thugs, but is defeated by their boss, Yanlang.\n\nRyo learns that Lan Di's father, Sunming Zhao, visited Bailu Village with Ryo's father to train under the local grandmaster. Zhao died under mysterious circumstances several years later. Ryo also discovers that the phoenix and dragon mirrors were created by Yuan's grandfather at the request of the Chinese emperor. Their creation is connected to the local Verdant Bridge, constructed to honor the visit of a Chinese envoy.\n\nAt the thugs' hideout, Ryo is defeated again by Yanlang. He convinces Sun, a local martial arts master, to teach him a powerful [[Bajiquan]] move, and uses it to defeat Yanlang. A village elder helps them discover a map to the treasure connected to the mirrors. Ryo fends off an attack from Lan Di's henchman Chai, who reveals that Yuan and Xu have been taken to the city of Niaowu.\n\nRyo and Shenhua travel to Niaowu by boat. Ryo learns that a local gang, the Red Snakes, is holding Yuan and Xu. Ryo encounters his Hong Kong ally, Wuying Ren, who has traveled to Niaowu in pursuit of the treasure connected to the mirrors. At the Red Snakes\u2019 hideout, Ryo and Ren are defeated by their boss, Ge, who uses an animalistic fighting style. Ryo meets a cormorant fisherman, Grandmaster Bei, who teaches him a similar Bajiquan move.\n\nRyo and Ren approach the hideout, only to find Li Feng, a mysterious woman whom Ryo has enountered in Niaowu. She tells them that the Red Snakes have kidnapped Shenhua and taken her across the river to a castle. Ryo convinces Bei to take him and Ren by boat. Before departing, Ren reveals that he has acquired a counterfeit phoenix mirror, believing it could be useful.\n\nThe three cross the river with Hsu, a former student of Bei, and Lin Shiling, the maiden of a local shrine. Ryo and Ren infiltrate the castle while the others guard the perimeter. Ryo finds Yuan and Xu trapped in a cell; Ryo defeats Chai again and releases them. They encounter a Chi You Men leader, Niao Sun, Li Feng's true identity. Ryo gives her the real phoenix mirror to save Shenhua, and Niao Sun tells them Lan Di is up ahead.\n\nRyo and Ren fight their way to the top of the castle, defeat Ge, and find Lan Di. Ryo challenges him to a fight, but Lan Di defeats him easily. Ren offers Lan Di the counterfeit phoenix mirror in exchange for Ryo's life. Lan Di accepts, but Ren hurls the mirror out of a window. Niao Sun has her men burn the castle to kill Lan Di and consolidate her power, and Ryo and Ren escape.\n\nRyo, Shenhua, Ren, Yuan, and Xu depart Niaowu by boat. On board, Yuan reveals that the mirrors were initially locked away in a cliff temple; Zhao Sunming retrieved them to keep them from \"falling into the wrong hands\". After Zhao died, his son, Lan Di, was raised by the Chi You Men. While captive, Yuan also learned that the Chi You have taken over the cliff temple. Ryo, Shenhua, and Ren continue their journey along the [[Great Wall of China]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Yu Suzuki - Game Developers Conference 2011 - Day 3 (2).jpg|thumb|''Shenmue'' creator Yu Suzuki speaking at the 2011 Game Developers Conference|alt=A 2011 photograph of Yu Suzuki]]{{See also|Shenmue III#Development}}The first two [[Shenmue|''Shenmue'' games]] were directed, written and produced by [[Yu Suzuki]], developed by [[Sega AM2]], and published by Sega for the [[Dreamcast]] in 1999 and 2001 respectively.

Between 100 and 150 million years ago, during the Lower [[Cretaceous]] Period, the [[Bay of Biscay]] [[Seafloor spreading|fanned out]], pushing present-day Spain against France and applying intense [[Compression (geology)|compressional pressure]] to large layers of [[sedimentary rock]]. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth's crust first affected the eastern part and moved progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the [[Eocene]] Epoch.\n\nThe eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of [[granite]] and [[gneiss]]ose rocks, while in the western part the granite peaks are flanked by layers of [[limestone]]. The massive and unworn character of the chain comes from its abundance of [[granite]], which is particularly resistant to [[erosion]], as well as weak [[glacier|glacial]] development.\n\nThe upper parts of the Pyrenees contain low-relief surfaces forming a [[peneplain]]. This peneplain originated no earlier than in [[Miocene|Late Miocene]] times. Presumably it formed at height as extensive sedimentation raised the local [[base level]] considerably.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Babault |first1=Julien |last2=Van Den Driessche |first2=Jean|last3=Bonnet |first3=Stephanie|last4=Castelltort |first4=S\u00e9bastien|last5=Crave |first5=Alain |date=2005 |title=Origin of the highly elevated Pyrenean peneplain |url= https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:20401/ATTACHMENT01|journal=Tectonics |volume=24 |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1029/2004TC001697 |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n== Landscape ==\nConspicuous features of Pyrenean scenery are:\n* the absence of great lakes, such as those that fill the lateral valleys of the Alps<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the rarity and relative high elevation of usable [[Mountain pass|passes]]<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the large number of the mountain torrents locally called ''[[Gave (stem)|gaves]]'', which often form lofty [[waterfall]]s, surpassed in Europe only by those of [[Scandinavia]]<ref name=EB1911/>\n* the frequency with which the upper end of a valley assumes the form of a semicircle of precipitous cliffs, called a [[cirque]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe highest [[waterfall]] is [[Gavarnie Falls|Gavarnie]] (462&nbsp;m or 1,515&nbsp;ft), at the head of the [[Gave de Pau]]; the [[Cirque de Gavarnie]], in the same valley,<ref name=EB1911/> together with the nearby Cirque de Troumouse and [[Cirque d'Estaub\u00e9]], are notable examples of the [[cirque]] formation. \n\nLow passes are lacking, and the principal roads and the railroads between France and Spain run only in the lowlands at the western and eastern ends of the Pyrenees, near sea level at [[Irun]] and [[La Jonquera]]. The main passes of note are:\n* the [[Col de la Perche]] ({{convert|1581|m|abbr=on}}), towards the east, between the valley of the [[T\u00eat River|T\u00eat]] and the valley of the [[river Segre|Segre]], \n* the [[Pas de la Casa|Pas de la Casa or Port d'Envalira]], the highest road pass in the Pyrenees at {{convert|2408|m|abbr=on}}, and one of the highest points of the European road network, which provides the route from France to Andorra,\n* the nearby [[Col de Puymorens]] ({{convert|1920|m|abbr=on}}), on [[European route E09]] between the French departments of [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]] and [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] [[Northern Catalonia|(Northern Catalonia).]]\n* the [[Port de la Bonaigua]] ({{convert|2070|m|abbr=on}}) connects Val d'Aran to the rest of Catalonia, although the nearby col at Plan de Beret ({{convert|1870|m|abbr=on}}), the watershed between the [[Garonne]] and the [[Noguera Pallaresa]], is the lowest point in the main ridge between the Col de la Perche, almost {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the east and the [[Col du Pourtalet]] ({{convert|1794|m|abbr=on}}), over {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the west.\n* the Col de [[Somport]] or Port de Canfranc ({{convert|1632|m|abbr=on}}), where there were old [[Roman road]]s. \n* the [[Roncevaux Pass]] ({{convert|1057|m|abbr=on}}), entirely in [[Navarre]] (Spain) is an important point on the [[Santiago de Compostela]] pilgrimage route\n\nBecause of the lack of low passes a number of tunnels have been drilled beneath the passes at Somport, Envalira and Puymorens, and new routes in the center of the range at [[Bielsa]] and [[Vielha Tunnel|Vielha]], as well as in the foothills of the Catalan Pyrenees at [[Serra del Cad\u00ed]].\n\nA notable visual feature of this [[mountain range]] is [[La Br\u00e8che de Roland]], a gap in the ridge line, which{{spaced ndash}}according to legend{{spaced ndash}}was created by [[Roland]].\n\n[[File:Ib\u00f3n.JPG|thumb|Ib\u00f3n (glacial lake) Basa Mora, in Gistain valley, [[Aragon]]. ]]\n\n== Natural resources ==\nThe metallic [[ore]]s of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance now, though there were [[iron]] mines at several locations in [[Geography of Andorra#Natural resources|Andorra]], as well as at [[Vicdessos]] in Ari\u00e8ge, and the foot of [[Canigou]] in [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] ([[Northern Catalonia]]) long ago. [[Coal]] deposits capable of being profitably worked are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes, but the French side has beds of [[lignite]].<ref name=EB1911/> The open pit of Trimoun near the commune of [[Luzenac]] (Ari\u00e8ge) is one of the greatest sources of [[talc]] in Europe.\n\n[[Mineral spring]]s are abundant and remarkable, and especially noteworthy are the [[hot spring]]s. The hot springs, among which those of [[Les Escaldes]] in Andorra, [[Panticosa]] and [[Lles]] in Spain, [[Ax-les-Thermes]], [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon]] and [[Eaux-Chaudes]] in France may be mentioned, are [[sulfur]]ous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre]] ([[Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]), [[Rennes-les-Bains]] ([[Aude]]), and [[Campagne-sur-Aude]] (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not hot.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Climate ==\nThe amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] the range receives, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees<ref name=EB1911/> because of the moist air that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean over the [[Bay of Biscay]]. After dropping its moisture over the western and central Pyrenees, the air is left dry over the eastern Pyrenees. The winter average temperature is {{cvt|-2|\u00b0C}}.\n\nSections of the mountain range vary in more than one respect. There are some [[glacier]]s in the western and snowy central Pyrenees, but there are no glaciers in the eastern Pyrenees because there is insufficient snowfall to cause their development. Glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down into the valleys but rather have their greatest lengths along the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, in a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there is substantial evidence of a much wider expanse of glaciation during the [[glacial period]]s. The best evidence of this is in the valley of Argeles Gazost, between Lourdes and Gavarnie, in the ''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'' of Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe annual snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from about {{convert|2700|to|2800|m}} above sea level.<ref name=EB1911/> In average the seasonal snow is observed at least 50% of the time above {{convert|1600|m}} between December and April.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gascoin|first1=S.|last2=Hagolle|first2=O.|last3=Huc|first3=M.|last4=Jarlan|first4=L.|last5=Dejoux|first5=J.F.|last6=Szczypta|first6=C.|last7=Marti|first7=R.|last8=S\u00e1nchez|first8=R.|title=A snow cover climatology for the Pyrenees from MODIS snow products|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|date=2015|issue=19|pages=2337\u20132351|doi=10.5194/hess-19-2337-2015|url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|access-date=2015-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529112043/http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|archive-date=2015-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n[[File:Cascada aigualluts.jpg|thumb|Aigualluts cascade in Benasque Valley, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]]\n{{See also|Forests of the Iberian Peninsula#The Eurosiberian region|l1=Forests of the Iberian Peninsula - Eurosiberian region}}\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{Main category|Flora of the Pyrenees}}\nA still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are wooded, but the extent of forest declines as one moves eastwards. The eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. Also moving from west to east, there is a change in the composition of the flora, with the change becoming most evident as one passes the centre of the mountain chain from which point the [[Corbi\u00e8res (region)|Corbi\u00e8res]] stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. Though the difference in latitude is only about 1\u00b0, in the west the flora resembles that of central Europe while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character. The Pyrenees are nearly as rich in [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that [[endemism]] is the occurrence of the monotypic genus ''Xatardia'' (family [[Apiaceae]]), which grows only on a high alpine pass between the Val d'Eynes and [[Catalonia]]. Other examples include ''[[Arenaria montana]]'', ''[[Bulbocodium vernum]]'', and ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]''. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the [[saxifrage]]s, several species of which are endemic here.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Fauna ===\nIn their [[fauna]] the Pyrenees present some striking instances of [[endemism]]. The [[Pyrenean desman]] is found only in some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains; the only other [[desman]]s are confined to the rivers of the [[Caucasus]] in southern Russia. The Pyrenean euprocte (''Euproctus pyrenaicus''), an endemic relative of the [[salamander]], also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among other peculiarities of Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the [[cave]]rns of Ari\u00e8ge, the principal genera of which are ''[[Anophthalmus]]'' and ''Adelops''.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pyrenees|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pyrenean ibex]] mysteriously became extinct in January 2000; the native Pyrenean [[brown bear]] was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s, but it was re-introduced in 1996 when three bears were brought from [[Slovenia]]. The bear population has bred successfully, and there are now believed to be about 15 brown bears in the central region around [[Fos, Haute-Garonne|Fos]], but only four native ones are still living in the [[Aspe Valley]].\n\n== Protected areas ==\n[[File:20080824-Ib\u00f3n de Barrancs.jpg|thumb|Ib\u00f3n de Barrancs ([[glacial lake]]) in Posets-Maladeta Natural Park, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]]\nPrincipal nature reserves and national parks:\n*[[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park]] (Spain)\n*[[Pyrenees National Park|Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es National Park]] (France)\n*[[Aig\u00fcestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park]] (Spain)\n*[[Natural Park of Posets-Maladeta|Posets-Maladeta Natural Park]] (Spain)\n\n== Demographics and culture ==\n[[File:Bovins estive Pic du Midi Ossau.jpg|thumb|Some [[Blonde d'Aquitaine]] on summer pasture near the [[Pic du Midi d'Ossau]]]]\nThe Pyrenean region possesses a varied ethnology, [[folklore]] and history: see [[Andorra]]; [[Aragon]]; [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]]; [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]; [[B\u00e9arn]]; [[Catalonia]]; [[Navarre]]; [[Roussillon]].

[[Occitan language|Occitan]] is also spoken in [[Val d'Aran]], [[Catalonia]], where it enjoys official status.\n\nAn important feature of rural life in the Pyrenees is '[[transhumance]]', the moving of livestock from the farms in the valleys up to the higher grounds of the mountains for the summer.<ref name=ariegecom>{{cite web |url=http://www.ariege.com/en/discover-ariege/agro-pastoralism/the-transhumance |title=The Transhumance |publisher=Ariege.com |accessdate=2016-02-01}}</ref> In this way the farming communities could keep larger herds than the lowland farms could support on their own.

The Pyrenees are also a good place for athletes to do high-altitude training in the summertime, such as by bicycling and cross-country running.\n\nIn the [[summer]] and the [[autumn]], the Pyrenees are usually featured in two of cycling's grand tours, the [[Tour de France]] held annually in July and the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] held in September. The stages held in the Pyrenees are often crucial legs of both tours, drawing hundreds of thousands of spectators to the region.\n\nThree main [[long-distance footpath]]s run the length of the mountain range: the [[GR 10 (France)|GR 10]] across the northern slopes, the [[GR 11 (Spain)|GR 11]] across the southern slopes, and the [[Haute Randonn\u00e9e Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9enne|HRP]] which traverses peaks and ridges along a high altitude route.

Between 100 and 150 million years ago, during the Lower [[Cretaceous]] Period, the [[Bay of Biscay]] [[Seafloor spreading|fanned out]], pushing present-day Spain against France and applying intense [[Compression (geology)|compressional pressure]] to large layers of [[sedimentary rock]]. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth's crust first affected the eastern part and moved progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the [[Eocene]] Epoch.\n\nThe eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of [[granite]] and [[gneiss]]ose rocks, while in the western part the granite peaks are flanked by layers of [[limestone]]. The massive and unworn character of the chain comes from its abundance of [[granite]], which is particularly resistant to [[erosion]], as well as weak [[glacier|glacial]] development.\n\nThe upper parts of the Pyrenees contain low-relief surfaces forming a [[peneplain]]. This peneplain originated no earlier than in [[Miocene|Late Miocene]] times.

The main passes of note are:\n* the [[Col de la Perche]] ({{convert|1581|m|abbr=on}}), towards the east, between the valley of the [[T\u00eat River|T\u00eat]] and the valley of the [[river Segre|Segre]], \n* the [[Pas de la Casa|Pas de la Casa or Port d'Envalira]], the highest road pass in the Pyrenees at {{convert|2408|m|abbr=on}}, and one of the highest points of the European road network, which provides the route from France to Andorra,\n* the nearby [[Col de Puymorens]] ({{convert|1920|m|abbr=on}}), on [[European route E09]] between the French departments of [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]] and [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] [[Northern Catalonia|(Northern Catalonia).]]\n* the [[Port de la Bonaigua]] ({{convert|2070|m|abbr=on}}) connects Val d'Aran to the rest of Catalonia, although the nearby col at Plan de Beret ({{convert|1870|m|abbr=on}}), the watershed between the [[Garonne]] and the [[Noguera Pallaresa]], is the lowest point in the main ridge between the Col de la Perche, almost {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the east and the [[Col du Pourtalet]] ({{convert|1794|m|abbr=on}}), over {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the west.\n* the Col de [[Somport]] or Port de Canfranc ({{convert|1632|m|abbr=on}}), where there were old [[Roman road]]s. \n* the [[Roncevaux Pass]] ({{convert|1057|m|abbr=on}}), entirely in [[Navarre]] (Spain) is an important point on the [[Santiago de Compostela]] pilgrimage route\n\nBecause of the lack of low passes a number of tunnels have been drilled beneath the passes at Somport, Envalira and Puymorens, and new routes in the center of the range at [[Bielsa]] and [[Vielha Tunnel|Vielha]], as well as in the foothills of the Catalan Pyrenees at [[Serra del Cad\u00ed]].\n\nA notable visual feature of this [[mountain range]] is [[La Br\u00e8che de Roland]], a gap in the ridge line, which{{spaced ndash}}according to legend{{spaced ndash}}was created by [[Roland]].\n\n[[File:Ib\u00f3n.JPG|thumb|Ib\u00f3n (glacial lake) Basa Mora, in Gistain valley, [[Aragon]]. ]]\n\n== Natural resources ==\nThe metallic [[ore]]s of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance now, though there were [[iron]] mines at several locations in [[Geography of Andorra#Natural resources|Andorra]], as well as at [[Vicdessos]] in Ari\u00e8ge, and the foot of [[Canigou]] in [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] ([[Northern Catalonia]]) long ago. [[Coal]] deposits capable of being profitably worked are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes, but the French side has beds of [[lignite]].<ref name=EB1911/> The open pit of Trimoun near the commune of [[Luzenac]] (Ari\u00e8ge) is one of the greatest sources of [[talc]] in Europe.\n\n[[Mineral spring]]s are abundant and remarkable, and especially noteworthy are the [[hot spring]]s. The hot springs, among which those of [[Les Escaldes]] in Andorra, [[Panticosa]] and [[Lles]] in Spain, [[Ax-les-Thermes]], [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon]] and [[Eaux-Chaudes]] in France may be mentioned, are [[sulfur]]ous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of [[Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre]] ([[Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]), [[Rennes-les-Bains]] ([[Aude]]), and [[Campagne-sur-Aude]] (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not hot.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Climate ==\nThe amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] the range receives, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees<ref name=EB1911/> because of the moist air that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean over the [[Bay of Biscay]]. After dropping its moisture over the western and central Pyrenees, the air is left dry over the eastern Pyrenees. The winter average temperature is {{cvt|-2|\u00b0C}}.\n\nSections of the mountain range vary in more than one respect. There are some [[glacier]]s in the western and snowy central Pyrenees, but there are no glaciers in the eastern Pyrenees because there is insufficient snowfall to cause their development. Glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down into the valleys but rather have their greatest lengths along the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, in a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there is substantial evidence of a much wider expanse of glaciation during the [[glacial period]]s. The best evidence of this is in the valley of Argeles Gazost, between Lourdes and Gavarnie, in the ''{{lang|fr|d\u00e9partement}}'' of Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe annual snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from about {{convert|2700|to|2800|m}} above sea level.<ref name=EB1911/> In average the seasonal snow is observed at least 50% of the time above {{convert|1600|m}} between December and April.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gascoin|first1=S.|last2=Hagolle|first2=O.|last3=Huc|first3=M.|last4=Jarlan|first4=L.|last5=Dejoux|first5=J.F.|last6=Szczypta|first6=C.|last7=Marti|first7=R.|last8=S\u00e1nchez|first8=R.|title=A snow cover climatology for the Pyrenees from MODIS snow products|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|date=2015|issue=19|pages=2337\u20132351|doi=10.5194/hess-19-2337-2015|url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|access-date=2015-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529112043/http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/2337/2015/hess-19-2337-2015.html|archive-date=2015-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n[[File:Cascada aigualluts.jpg|thumb|Aigualluts cascade in Benasque Valley, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]]\n{{See also|Forests of the Iberian Peninsula#The Eurosiberian region|l1=Forests of the Iberian Peninsula - Eurosiberian region}}\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{Main category|Flora of the Pyrenees}}\nA still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are wooded, but the extent of forest declines as one moves eastwards. The eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. Also moving from west to east, there is a change in the composition of the flora, with the change becoming most evident as one passes the centre of the mountain chain from which point the [[Corbi\u00e8res (region)|Corbi\u00e8res]] stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. Though the difference in latitude is only about 1\u00b0, in the west the flora resembles that of central Europe while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character. The Pyrenees are nearly as rich in [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that [[endemism]] is the occurrence of the monotypic genus ''Xatardia'' (family [[Apiaceae]]), which grows only on a high alpine pass between the Val d'Eynes and [[Catalonia]]. Other examples include ''[[Arenaria montana]]'', ''[[Bulbocodium vernum]]'', and ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]''. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the [[saxifrage]]s, several species of which are endemic here.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Fauna ===\nIn their [[fauna]] the Pyrenees present some striking instances of [[endemism]]. The [[Pyrenean desman]] is found only in some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains; the only other [[desman]]s are confined to the rivers of the [[Caucasus]] in southern Russia. The Pyrenean euprocte (''Euproctus pyrenaicus''), an endemic relative of the [[salamander]], also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among other peculiarities of Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the [[cave]]rns of Ari\u00e8ge, the principal genera of which are ''[[Anophthalmus]]'' and ''Adelops''.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pyrenees|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pyrenean ibex]] mysteriously became extinct in January 2000; the native Pyrenean [[brown bear]] was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s, but it was re-introduced in 1996 when three bears were brought from [[Slovenia]]. The bear population has bred successfully, and there are now believed to be about 15 brown bears in the central region around [[Fos, Haute-Garonne|Fos]], but only four native ones are still living in the [[Aspe Valley]].\n\n== Protected areas ==\n[[File:20080824-Ib\u00f3n de Barrancs.jpg|thumb|Ib\u00f3n de Barrancs ([[glacial lake]]) in Posets-Maladeta Natural Park, [[Aragon]] (Spain)]]\nPrincipal nature reserves and national parks:\n*[[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park]] (Spain)\n*[[Pyrenees National Park|Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es National Park]] (France)\n*[[Aig\u00fcestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park]] (Spain)\n*[[Natural Park of Posets-Maladeta|Posets-Maladeta Natural Park]] (Spain)\n\n== Demographics and culture ==\n[[File:Bovins estive Pic du Midi Ossau.jpg|thumb|Some [[Blonde d'Aquitaine]] on summer pasture near the [[Pic du Midi d'Ossau]]]]\nThe Pyrenean region possesses a varied ethnology, [[folklore]] and history: see [[Andorra]]; [[Aragon]]; [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]]; [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]; [[B\u00e9arn]]; [[Catalonia]]; [[Navarre]]; [[Roussillon]].

[[Occitan language|Occitan]] is also spoken in [[Val d'Aran]], [[Catalonia]], where it enjoys official status.\n\nAn important feature of rural life in the Pyrenees is '[[transhumance]]', the moving of livestock from the farms in the valleys up to the higher grounds of the mountains for the summer.<ref name=ariegecom>{{cite web |url=http://www.ariege.com/en/discover-ariege/agro-pastoralism/the-transhumance |title=The Transhumance |publisher=Ariege.com |accessdate=2016-02-01}}</ref> In this way the farming communities could keep larger herds than the lowland farms could support on their own.

The Pyrenees are also a good place for athletes to do high-altitude training in the summertime, such as by bicycling and cross-country running.\n\nIn the [[summer]] and the [[autumn]], the Pyrenees are usually featured in two of cycling's grand tours, the [[Tour de France]] held annually in July and the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] held in September. The stages held in the Pyrenees are often crucial legs of both tours, drawing hundreds of thousands of spectators to the region.\n\nThree main [[long-distance footpath]]s run the length of the mountain range: the [[GR 10 (France)|GR 10]] across the northern slopes, the [[GR 11 (Spain)|GR 11]] across the southern slopes, and the [[Haute Randonn\u00e9e Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9enne|HRP]] which traverses peaks and ridges along a high altitude route. In addition, there are numerous marked and unmarked trails throughout the region.\n\n''[[Pirena (race)|Pirena]]'' is a dog-[[mushing]] competition held in the Pyrenees.\n\n=== Ski resorts ===\n[[File:Ski Center.jpg|thumb|Ski Center, Cerler (Spain)]]\n\n[[Skiing|Ski]] resorts in the Pyrenees include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alp 2500]] (Spain)\n* [[Arette]] (France)\n* [[Ast\u00fan]] (Spain)\n* [[Artouste]] (France)\n* [[Ax-les-Thermes]] (France)\n* [[Baqueira-Beret]] (Spain)\n* [[Bo\u00ed Ta\u00fcll Resort]] (Spain)\n* [[La Mongie|Bareges-La Mongie (Tourmalet)]] (France)\n* [[Luz Ardiden]] (France)\n* [[Bourg-d'Oueil]] (France)\n* [[Cauterets]] (France)\n* [[Candanch\u00fa]] (Spain)\n* [[Cerler]] (Spain)\n* [[Espot Esqu\u00ed]] (Spain)\n* [[Font-Romeu]] (France)\n* [[Formigal]] (Spain)\n* [[Gavarnie G\u00e8dre]]<ref>[http://pistehors.com/backcountry/wiki/Ski-Areas/Pays-Toy Pays Toy Ski Resort] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329082309/http://pistehors.com/backcountry/wiki/Ski-Areas/Pays-Toy |date=2009-03-29 }} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130731201355/http://pistehors.com/backcountry/wiki/Ski-Areas/Pays-Toy; archive])</ref> (France)\n* [[Gourette]] (France)\n* [[Guzet-Neige]] (France)\n* [[Hautacam]] (France)\n* [[La Molina (ski resort)|La Molina]] (Spain)\n* [[La Pierre Saint Martin]]\n* [[Le Mourtis]] (France)\n* [[Les Angles, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Les Angles]] (France)\n* [[Luchon-Superbagn\u00e8res]] (France)\n* [[Luz-Ardiden]] (France)\n* [[Nistos cap nestes]] (France)\n* [[Panticosa-Los Lagos]] (Spain)\n* [[Pas de la Casa]] (Andorra)\n* [[Peyragudes]] (France)\n* [[Piau-Engaly]] (France)\n* [[Port Ain\u00e9]] (Spain)\n* [[Port del Comte (ski resort)|Port del Comte]] (Spain)\n* [[Somport]] (France-Spain)\n* [[Saint Lary]] (France)\n* [[Soldeu|Soldeu / El Tarter]] (Andorra)\n* [[Superbagn\u00e8res]] (France)\n* [[Tavascan]] (Spain)\n* [[Vall de N\u00faria]] (Spain)\n* [[Vallnord]] (Andorra)\n* [[Vallter 2000]] (Spain)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Montcalm Massif]]\n* [[:Category:Mountain passes of the Pyrenees|Mountain passes of the Pyrenees]]\n* [[Pre-Pyrenees]]\n* [[Sub-Pyrenees]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|first=Hilaire|last=Belloc|title=The Pyrenees|year=1909|publisher=Methuen & Co., London}}\n* {{cite book|first= Friedrich |last= Edelmayer |title= The Pyrenees Region |year=2012|publisher=[[Institute of European History]]|language=German, English|url= http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0159-2012053102}}\n* {{cite book|first=Claus|last=Paegelow|title=Pyren\u00e4en Bibliografie.

Canada took over the sponsorship because of the potential for discovery of new land and Stefansson, who though born in [[Canada]] was now an American, re-established his Canadian citizenship. The expedition was divided into a Northern Party led by Stefansson, and a Southern Party led by [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R M. Anderson]].\n\n==Northern Party==\nThe objective of the Northern Party was to explore for new land north and west of the known lands of the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]]. At this time the possible existence of large undiscovered land masses, comparable to the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic islands]] or even a small continent, was scientifically plausible. The approach of the Northern Party, besides simply going out and looking for land, was a program of through-ice depth soundings to map the edge of the continental shelf. Meteorological, magnetic, and marine biological investigations were also planned.\n\n==Southern Party==\nThe objective of the Southern Party was scientific documentation of the geography, geology, resources, wildlife, and people of the [[Mackenzie River]] delta and adjacent regions of Canada between [[Cape Parry]] and the [[Kent Peninsula]], for about {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} inland, and southern and eastern [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]]. Copper deposits and trade routes were of particular interest.\n\n==Results==\n\n1913 was a particularly bad year for [[Arctic]] navigation. All of the expedition ships were frozen in before they could reach their initial destination of [[Herschel Island]]. The principal ship of the expedition, the ''[[HMCS Karluk|Karluk]]'', was [[Last voyage of the Karluk|carried off and eventually crushed by the ice]], leading to the loss of eleven lives before a famous rescue. Most of the Southern Party had travelled in other ships of the expedition, and Stefansson left the ''Karluk'' with a party of five before the ship was carried off. Stefansson promptly purchased a small [[schooner]], the ''North Star'', reconstituted the Northern Party with local hires and resumed exploring. Only one of the fourteen ''Karluk'' survivors rejoined the expedition. The expedition purchased another ship, the ''Polar Bear'', in 1915. The Southern Party remained in the North through the summer of 1916, exploring and mapping as far east as [[Bathurst Inlet]]. Some members of the Northern Party continued exploring through 1918.
