A local household name in the music industry, he enjoys a large following on Vietnamese television. Quoc Trung distinguishes himself as a man of vision with innovative approaches in the Music business. His creative works set the standards for Vietnamese pop culture and inspires numerous contemporaries and emerging artists.\n\n==Recent activities and on-going projects==\nA deep thinker and visionary, Quoc Trung yearns to reach out as far as his music with take him, beyond his birth country all the while introducing current new sounds to music listeners in Vietnam. One of his goals is moving the Vietnamese music industry towards more standardized practices with intellectual property and copyright laws.  Quoc Trung has collaborated with various international artists, and performed in many countries including for the Royal Family in [[Japan]].  He has taken part in esteemed music festivals such as the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] - [[France]], [[Roskilde Music Festival]] - [[Denmark]] and many other festivals in [[Asia]].  He recently announced he is gearing up to put forward Music Festivals in Vietnam that will bring more international music and performers from other parts of the globe. His Work and experience include:\n\n''The Hanoi Monsoon Music Festival'' 2014 is a 3-day event of live performances of various musical genres. With over 100 performers ranging from foreign and local artists such as Julien Sato (France), Dj Van Cliffe (Japan), 9Bach (Wales), Benjamin Schoos (Belgium), Carpark North (Denmark), Lulu Rouge (Denmark), Dominic Miller (UK-Argentina), Yi Sung Yol (South Korea).

Although his best contestant, Ha My, did not win the title, her songs, performances, sound arrangements under Quoc Trung's guidance showcased the artist's soul depth and maturity which were appreciated by more seasoned music listeners and audiophiles. With help from his collaborator/assistant  the talented female musician Thien Huong Luu, Quoc Trung team\u2019s contestants performances were most memorable throughout the episodes of season II.\n\n''The Roots'' is a cross-cultural project in collaboration with French-Vietnamese jazz guitarist [[Nguyen Le]]. The duo aim to bring Vietnamese folk sounds to a wider audience with the release of two albums in 2013 and through performances at international music festivals. This project was officially launched with a concert, billed as Kh\u1edfi Ngu\u1ed3n (The Roots- Beginning) on September 1, 2012 at the prestigious venue [[Hanoi Opera House]]. Alongside Quoc Trung and Nguyen Le, the concert featured Vietnamese pop diva Thanh Lam, traditional opera singer Kieu Anh, Tunisian musician Dhafer Youssef, and German percussion artist Rhani Krija.\n\nJudge for ''[[Vietnam Idol]]'', the televised singing competition (season 2010 and 2012). A veteran producer and well regarded by his peers, Quoc Trung first appeared on the 3rd season of Vietnam Idol in 2010. He is since dubbed and apprehended by many contestants as Sir Difficult due to his sharp observation, keen ears and unequivocal comments. With his serious yet witty commenting style, Quoc Trung greatly contributed to the unprecedented social media phenomenon and assisted to the rise of 3rd season Vietnam Idol winner Uyen Linh in 2010.\n\n''Thanh Viet Production'' founded by Quoc Trung in 2011, a record label and stage production company. He amiably took Vietnam Idol 2010 winner Uyen Linh under his wings, Quoc Trung produced her first album My Own Dream (Gi\u1ea5c M\u01a1 T\u00f4i) released in February 2011 under Thanh Viet Production. Thanh Viet also put together the annually concert series \u201cHold Hands when Summer Comes\u201d(C\u1ea7m Tay M\u00f9a H\u00e8) and represent several talented young Vietnamese artists.\n\nFor earlier works see Personal and Love life, Production Discography.\n\n==Early life==\nQuoc Trung is the only son of [[Trung Ki\u00ean]], former vice-minister of Culture and Information in Vietnam, and of Thanh Nga (deceased) a stage performer. Being descendant of performers-artistes, born and raised in [[Hanoi]], Quoc Trung is considered a late-boomer musically, his musical sensibility only became apparent in his early teens, which is uncommon for a child of similar upbringing.\n\n==Academic Study==\nHis parents wanted Quoc Trung to follow the path of classical music. Despite his father's intent, young Quoc Trung rather played with his friends, and had only begun to seriously study classical piano at age 12. Quoc Trung progressed quickly with high marks. Unlike his father, a reputable tenor in classical and semi-classical, young Quoc Trung revealed an affinity for Pop music and sound-arrangement.  He opted to pursuit his passion and graduated from the Faculty of Composition at the Hanoi Conservatory of Music.  Quoc Trung was then sent for 2 years to National Music Academy of [[Sofia]] in [[Bulgaria]] for advanced learning. The National Music Academy of Sofia was unique and renowned musical institution of the Pop genre, in the then communist/socialist countries.\n\n==Personal and Love life==\nQuoc Trung and his wife Thanh Lam knew each other since childhood. When they fell in love they became the inspirational driving force behind each other's rising,  fame and success. Upon returning to Ha Noi, Vietnam in 1991, Quoc Trung founded a music band with like-minded musicians called The Orient. Within two years of its creation, The Orient reached the top spot in the National Music Band Festival. Through Quoc Trung's leadership he transformed the band into the most popular band in North Vietnam. For over a decade, Quoc Trung and his bandmates produced and propelled singer Thanh Lam to stardom and Queen of Pop status, being the first Vietnamese female singer with own band. As the Diva\u2019s singing performances and career gradually won over public's adulation, so grew the popularity of Quoc Trung and The Orient band from the North Vietnam to South Vietnam over the years.\n\nUnlike their art and collaboration in work that continues until today, the couple separated in 2004, after ten years. Both parted their own ways to collaborate with different entourage and artists. Ex-wife Thanh Lam bears two children s, a boy and a girl 17 and 19 as of 2015. Quoc Trung went on to build a major recording studio, produced most of Vietnam\u2019s biggest singing stars for more than 20 years.\n\nQuoc Trung remained single father for several years after the separation with his first-wife Thanh Lam. He finally found another half and is currently happy in a relationship with a women who can make his heart sings again.\n\n==Influences and Styles==\nThe distinct impression about Quoc Trung is that he possesses the ability to fuse and fine-tuning traditional Vietnamese sounds with modern electronic influences without losing his original pop and folklore identity. Quoc Trung incorporates many Vietnamese traditional strings instruments (Dan Bau, Dan Tranh, Dan Co, etc.), which he blends with digital mixers, samplers, and current Western instruments to create new revitalized tunes. As Quoc Trung gained more experience and exposure over the years in his musical journey, his style evolved and transitioned to what are now considered world/electronic/experimental/ambient/lounge all the while preserving his strong ties to the Vietnamese traditional instruments and sounds.\n\nQuoc Trung has said to be influenced by [[Phil Colins]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Moby]], [[Massive Attack]], [[The Prodigy]], [[Richard Bona]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Air (French band)]] etc.\n\n==Achievements==\nThroughout his lifetime Quoc Trung has received a wide range of honours and awards. His reputation firmly established as the top producer and musical authority in Vietnam's music industry. His opinions are flag-bearers and are well respected by the public, professional musicians, artists and producers. In 2012, Quoc Trung was very vocal about the digital intellectual property copyright issue and the distribution of music on Internet websites, who freely broadcast tracks from new Albums with no regards to the artists and their copyrights in Vietnam. He admitted that this is a worldwide problem for the entertainment industry and not unique to Vietnam. His contestation proved to bring results as the Vietnam government starts to clench, regulate and apply profit sharing barometers between these online websites and recording artists.\n\nBeside working as a producer, arranger, music director for shows and festivals, Quoc Trung has also ventured in to the cinema and TV, composed soundtrack commercials, most notably for the [[Sony]] brand. He has written music for a number of Asian feature films. His music was even played in the official ads for [[Vietnam Airlines]].\n\n==Collaborators==\n[[Thanh Lam]], [[Duong Thu]], [[Niels Lan Doky]], [[Nguyen Le]], Martin Hedin, [[Dhafer Youssef]], Rhani Krija, Hong Nhung, [[Stephan Eicher]], [[T\u00f9ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng]], [[Xavier Desandre Navarre]], Bui Huy Tuan, Manu Katche, Truong Anh Quan,\nBent Bitte Iversen, [[My Linh]], [[Tran Thu Ha]], [[Uyen Linh]] and others.\n\n==Discography==\nThe Roots (2012) - V\u00f2ng Tr\u00f2n (2011) - Wishing Upon the Moon (2011) - Nh\u01b0 c\u00e1nh v\u1ea1c bay (2006) - Road to Infinity (2005) - Khu v\u01b0\u1eddn y\u00ean t\u0129nh (2004) - M\u1ed9t ng\u00e0y m\u1edbi (2003) and more previous works.\n\n==Conclusion==\nQuoc Trung is also known as a devoted recording studio builder.

A local household name in the music industry, he enjoys a large following on Vietnamese television. Quoc Trung distinguishes himself as a man of vision with innovative approaches in the Music business. His creative works set the standards for Vietnamese pop culture and inspires numerous contemporaries and emerging artists.\n\n==Recent activities and on-going projects==\nA deep thinker and visionary, Quoc Trung yearns to reach out as far as his music with take him, beyond his birth country all the while introducing current new sounds to music listeners in Vietnam. One of his goals is moving the Vietnamese music industry towards more standardized practices with intellectual property and copyright laws.  Quoc Trung has collaborated with various international artists, and performed in many countries including for the Royal Family in [[Japan]].  He has taken part in esteemed music festivals such as the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] - [[France]], [[Roskilde Music Festival]] - [[Denmark]] and many other festivals in [[Asia]].  He recently announced he is gearing up to put forward Music Festivals in Vietnam that will bring more international music and performers from other parts of the globe. His Work and experience include:\n\n''The Hanoi Monsoon Music Festival'' 2014 is a 3-day event of live performances of various musical genres. With over 100 performers ranging from foreign and local artists such as Julien Sato (France), Dj Van Cliffe (Japan), 9Bach (Wales), Benjamin Schoos (Belgium), Carpark North (Denmark), Lulu Rouge (Denmark), Dominic Miller (UK-Argentina), Yi Sung Yol (South Korea).

Although his best contestant, Ha My, did not win the title, her songs, performances, sound arrangements under Quoc Trung's guidance showcased the artist's soul depth and maturity which were appreciated by more seasoned music listeners and audiophiles. With help from his collaborator/assistant  the talented female musician Thien Huong Luu, Quoc Trung team\u2019s contestants performances were most memorable throughout the episodes of season II.\n\n''The Roots'' is a cross-cultural project in collaboration with French-Vietnamese jazz guitarist [[Nguyen Le]]. The duo aim to bring Vietnamese folk sounds to a wider audience with the release of two albums in 2013 and through performances at international music festivals. This project was officially launched with a concert, billed as Kh\u1edfi Ngu\u1ed3n (The Roots- Beginning) on September 1, 2012 at the prestigious venue [[Hanoi Opera House]]. Alongside Quoc Trung and Nguyen Le, the concert featured Vietnamese pop diva Thanh Lam, traditional opera singer Kieu Anh, Tunisian musician Dhafer Youssef, and German percussion artist Rhani Krija.\n\nJudge for ''[[Vietnam Idol]]'', the televised singing competition (season 2010 and 2012). A veteran producer and well regarded by his peers, Quoc Trung first appeared on the 3rd season of Vietnam Idol in 2010. He is since dubbed and apprehended by many contestants as Sir Difficult due to his sharp observation, keen ears and unequivocal comments. With his serious yet witty commenting style, Quoc Trung greatly contributed to the unprecedented social media phenomenon and assisted to the rise of 3rd season Vietnam Idol winner Uyen Linh in 2010.\n\n''Thanh Viet Production'' founded by Quoc Trung in 2011, a record label and stage production company. He amiably took Vietnam Idol 2010 winner Uyen Linh under his wings, Quoc Trung produced her first album My Own Dream (Gi\u1ea5c M\u01a1 T\u00f4i) released in February 2011 under Thanh Viet Production. Thanh Viet also put together the annually concert series \u201cHold Hands when Summer Comes\u201d(C\u1ea7m Tay M\u00f9a H\u00e8) and represent several talented young Vietnamese artists.\n\nFor earlier works see Personal and Love life, Production Discography.\n\n==Early life==\nQuoc Trung is the only son of [[Trung Kien Nguyen]], Minister of Culture and Information in Vietnam, and of Thanh Nga (deceased) a stage performer. Being descendant of performers-artistes, born and raised in [[Hanoi]], Quoc Trung is considered a late-boomer musically, his musical sensibility only became apparent in his early teens, which is uncommon for a child of similar upbringing.\n\n==Academic Study==\nHis parents wanted Quoc Trung to follow the path of classical music. Despite his father's intent, young Quoc Trung rather played with his friends, and had only begun to seriously study classical piano at age 12. Quoc Trung progressed quickly with high marks. Unlike his father, a reputable tenor in classical and semi-classical, young Quoc Trung revealed an affinity for Pop music and sound-arrangement.  He opted to pursuit his passion and graduated from the Faculty of Composition at the Hanoi Conservatory of Music.  Quoc Trung was then sent for 2 years to National Music Academy of [[Sofia]] in [[Bulgaria]] for advanced learning. The National Music Academy of Sofia was unique and renowned musical institution of the Pop genre, in the then communist/socialist countries.\n\n==Personal and Love life==\nQuoc Trung and his wife Thanh Lam knew each other since childhood. When they fell in love they became the inspirational driving force behind each other's rising,  fame and success. Upon returning to Ha Noi, Vietnam in 1991, Quoc Trung founded a music band with like-minded musicians called The Orient. Within two years of its creation, The Orient reached the top spot in the National Music Band Festival. Through Quoc Trung's leadership he transformed the band into the most popular band in North Vietnam. For over a decade, Quoc Trung and his bandmates produced and propelled singer Thanh Lam to stardom and Queen of Pop status, being the first Vietnamese female singer with own band. As the Diva\u2019s singing performances and career gradually won over public's adulation, so grew the popularity of Quoc Trung and The Orient band from the North Vietnam to South Vietnam over the years.\n\nUnlike their art and collaboration in work that continues until today, the couple separated in 2004, after ten years. Both parted their own ways to collaborate with different entourage and artists. Ex-wife Thanh Lam bears two children s, a boy and a girl 17 and 19 as of 2015. Quoc Trung went on to build a major recording studio, produced most of Vietnam\u2019s biggest singing stars for more than 20 years.\n\nQuoc Trung remained single father for several years after the separation with his first-wife Thanh Lam. He finally found another half and is currently happy in a relationship with a women who can make his heart sings again.\n\n==Influences and Styles==\nThe distinct impression about Quoc Trung is that he possesses the ability to fuse and fine-tuning traditional Vietnamese sounds with modern electronic influences without losing his original pop and folklore identity. Quoc Trung incorporates many Vietnamese traditional strings instruments (Dan Bau, Dan Tranh, Dan Co, etc.), which he blends with digital mixers, samplers, and current Western instruments to create new revitalized tunes. As Quoc Trung gained more experience and exposure over the years in his musical journey, his style evolved and transitioned to what are now considered world/electronic/experimental/ambient/lounge all the while preserving his strong ties to the Vietnamese traditional instruments and sounds.\n\nQuoc Trung has said to be influenced by [[Phil Colins]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Moby]], [[Massive Attack]], [[The Prodigy]], [[Richard Bona]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Air (French band)]] etc.\n\n==Achievements==\nThroughout his lifetime Quoc Trung has received a wide range of honours and awards. His reputation firmly established as the top producer and musical authority in Vietnam's music industry. His opinions are flag-bearers and are well respected by the public, professional musicians, artists and producers. In 2012, Quoc Trung was very vocal about the digital intellectual property copyright issue and the distribution of music on Internet websites, who freely broadcast tracks from new Albums with no regards to the artists and their copyrights in Vietnam. He admitted that this is a worldwide problem for the entertainment industry and not unique to Vietnam. His contestation proved to bring results as the Vietnam government starts to clench, regulate and apply profit sharing barometers between these online websites and recording artists.\n\nBeside working as a producer, arranger, music director for shows and festivals, Quoc Trung has also ventured in to the cinema and TV, composed soundtrack commercials, most notably for the [[Sony]] brand. He has written music for a number of Asian feature films. His music was even played in the official ads for [[Vietnam Airlines]].\n\n==Collaborators==\n[[Thanh Lam]], [[Duong Thu]], [[Niels Lan Doky]], [[Nguyen Le]], Martin Hedin, [[Dhafer Youssef]], Rhani Krija, Hong Nhung, [[Stephan Eicher]], [[T\u00f9ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng]], [[Xavier Desandre Navarre]], Bui Huy Tuan, Manu Katche, Truong Anh Quan,\nBent Bitte Iversen, [[My Linh]], [[Tran Thu Ha]], [[Uyen Linh]] and others.\n\n==Discography==\nThe Roots (2012) - V\u00f2ng Tr\u00f2n (2011) - Wishing Upon the Moon (2011) - Nh\u01b0 c\u00e1nh v\u1ea1c bay (2006) - Road to Infinity (2005) - Khu v\u01b0\u1eddn y\u00ean t\u0129nh (2004) - M\u1ed9t ng\u00e0y m\u1edbi (2003) and more previous works.\n\n==Conclusion==\nQuoc Trung is also known as a devoted recording studio builder. For many years his studio in Ha Noi were second to none, it was the dream venue to record albums and the envy of many composers/producers. Collecting and redistributing studio equipment remain his hobby and it also what keeps this veteran young at heart. As of today, Quoc Trung continues on his chosen path and he is looking forward to challenging himself on a higher level to the world audience with international artists and collaborations.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\nhttp://www.monsoonfestival.vn/\n\nhttp://www.talkvietnam.com/2014/03/stop-using-rhino-horn-campaign-launched-in-vietnam/#.UzghNq1dVn8\n\nhttp://talkvietnam.com/2012/09/cross-cultural-collaboration/#.UFKLk2jyZNE\n\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=42893#.UFKO4WjyZNE\n\nhttp://www.thanhniennews.com/2010/pages/20120831-a-return-to-the-roots.aspx\n\nhttp://vnmusic.com.vn/p696-chan-dung-nguoi-dan-ong-bi-hiem-quoc-trung.html\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/quoctrung\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quoc Trung}}\n[[Category:1966 births]]\n[[Category:People from Hanoi]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "name_user": "DangTungDuong", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarly life", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%E1%BB%91c_Trung"}

Carcinogenesis is caused by mutation and epimutation of the genetic material of normal cells, which upsets the normal balance between proliferation and cell death. This results in uncontrolled cell division and the [[Somatic evolution in cancer|evolution of those cells]] by [[natural selection]] in the body. The uncontrolled and often rapid proliferation of cells can lead to benign or malignant tumours (cancer). [[Benign tumor]]s do not spread to other parts of the body or invade other tissues. [[Malignant tumor]]s can invade other organs, spread to distant locations ([[metastasis]]) and become life-threatening.\n\nMore than one mutation is necessary for carcinogenesis. In fact, a series of several mutations to certain classes of genes is usually required before a normal cell will transform into a cancer cell.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title = A genetic model for colorectal tumorigenesis\n| journal = Cell\n| volume = 61\n| issue = 5\n| pages = 759\u201367\n| date=June 1990\n| pmid = 2188735\n| doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(90)90186-I\n| author1 = Fearon ER\n| author2 = Vogelstein B\n|name-list-format=vanc\n}}</ref>\n\nDamage to [[DNA]] can be caused by exposure to radiation, chemicals, and other environmental sources, but mutations also accumulate naturally over time through uncorrected errors in [[DNA transcription]], making age another risk factor.

They are also able to spread from one part of the body to another in a process known as [[metastasis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=National Cancer Institute: is this cancer?|url=http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer|accessdate=1 August 2016|date=2007-09-17}}</ref>\n[[File:Breast cancer cells.jpg|thumb|[[Breast cancer]] cells]]\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are different categories of cancer cell, defined according to the cell type from which they originate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Histological types of cancer - CRS - Cancer Research Society|url=http://www.crs-src.ca/page.aspx?pid=1765|website=www.crs-src.ca}}</ref>\n\n* [[Carcinoma]], the majority of cancer cells are [[epithelial]] in origin, beginning in the membranous tissues that line the surfaces of the body.\n* [[Leukaemia]], originate in the tissues responsible for producing new [[blood cells]], most commonly in the [[bone marrow]].\n* [[Lymphoma]] and [[myeloma]], derived from cells of the [[immune system]].\n* [[Sarcoma]], originating in [[connective tissue]], including fat, muscle and bone.\n* [[Central nervous system]], derived from cells of the body and spinal cord.\n* [[Mesothelioma]], originating in the [[mesothelium]]; the lining of body cavities.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile: Apocrine carcinoma - high mag.jpg|Carcinoma\nFile:Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia smear.jpg|Leukaemia\nFile:Burkitt lymphoma, touch prep, Wright stain.jpg|Lymphoma\nFile:Multiple myeloma (1) MG stain.jpg|Myeloma\nFile:Ewing sarcoma cells.png|Sarcoma\nFile:Well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma - alt 2 -- intermed. mag.jpg|Mesothelioma\n</gallery>\n\n==Histology==\n[[File:Normal and cancer cells structure.jpg|left|thumb|[[Histology|Histological]] features of normal cells and cancer cells]]\n\nCancer cells have distinguishing [[histological]] features visible under the microscope.

Carcinogenesis is caused by mutation and epimutation of the genetic material of normal cells, which upsets the normal balance between proliferation and cell death. This results in uncontrolled cell division and the [[Somatic evolution in cancer|evolution of those cells]] by [[natural selection]] in the body. The uncontrolled and often rapid proliferation of cells can lead to benign or malignant tumours (cancer). [[Benign tumor]]s do not spread to other parts of the body or invade other tissues. [[Malignant tumor]]s can invade other organs, spread to distant locations ([[metastasis]]) and become life-threatening.\n\nMore than one mutation is necessary for carcinogenesis. In fact, a series of several mutations to certain classes of genes is usually required before a normal cell will transform into a cancer cell.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title = A genetic model for colorectal tumorigenesis\n| journal = Cell\n| volume = 61\n| issue = 5\n| pages = 759\u201367\n| date=June 1990\n| pmid = 2188735\n| doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(90)90186-I\n| author1 = Fearon ER\n| author2 = Vogelstein B\n|name-list-format=vanc\n}}</ref>\n\nDamage to [[DNA]] can be caused by exposure to radiation, chemicals, and other environmental sources, but mutations also accumulate naturally over time through uncorrected errors in [[DNA transcription]], making age another risk factor.

On his first day at his new school, he meets a beautiful second-year female student named Chizuru Minamoto. Chizuru asks him to meet her alone in the music room. When he arrives, she tells him that she is in love with him and accidentally reveals to him that she is in fact a [[kitsune|fox spirit]]. Chizuru constantly and openly flirts with Kouta, even in front of others, embarrassing him greatly. Soon after the story begins, a wolf spirit named Nozomu Ezomori transfers into Kouta's school and class. From day one, she is all over Kouta, serving to embarrass him more and causing Chizuru to become annoyed at her new competition for Kouta's affection.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|Kouta Oyamada|\u5c0f\u5c71\u7530 \u8015\u592a|Oyamada K\u014dta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamiko Noto]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118161848/http://www.kanokon.com/staffcast.html|archivedate=January 18, 2013|url=http://www.kanokon.com/staffcast.html|title=Staff & Cast|publisher=www.kanokon.com|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}</ref>|[[Mona Marshall]]}}\n:Kouta is the protagonist of the story.

He is initially reluctant to engage in the \"intimate\" acts Chizuru desires, but does so later on in the series citing her inspiration. Kouta's true bond with Chizuru is shown when they fuse into a powerful being that gives Kouta black fox ears with tails. According to Chizuru's brother Tayura, this possession can only happen if a human and a [[y\u014dkai]] share a deep emotional bond with each other.<ref>{{cite book|title=Kanokon Omnibus 1-2|author=Katsumi Nishino|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]|date=April 16, 2013|chapter=1|pages=79-80|ISBN=978-1-9378-6735-5}}</ref>\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chizuru Minamoto|\u6e90 \u5343\u9db4|Minamoto Chizuru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayako Kawasumi]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast\"/>|[[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tower.com/kanokon-girl-who-cried-fox-tv-ova-collection-n-a-dvd/wapi/122152628|title=DVD: Kanokon: The Girl Who Cried Fox TV & OVA Collection (DVD) with Ayako Kawasumi, Dorothy Elias-Fahn, Mamiko Noto, Mona Marshall|author=|date=|work=Tower.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\n:Chizuru is second-year female student at Kouta's school. On the outside she appears to be a well endowed teenage girl, but she is in fact a powerful [[kitsune]]. When she changes form, her black hair turns blonde, and she gains fox ears and a tail. While it is implied by her brother Tayura that she is 400 years old, it is later revealed that her age may be in the thousands. She has no recollection of her past from before she met her foster mother Tamamo, but over time remembers some things she had forgotten about herself. From the start of the series she has fallen in love with Kouta, and is constantly hanging around him. She very much wants to enter into a \"relationship of sin\" with him and is very forthright in her almost constant sexual suggestions and actions.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nozomu Ezomori|\u72b9\u5b88 \u671b|Ezomori Nozomu}}\n:{{Voiced by|Miy\u016b Takeuchi<ref name=\"Japanese cast\"/>|May Kao}}\n:Nozomu is a first-year female transfer student at Kouta's school.

Like his sister, he is also a [[Kitsune|fox spirit]] but was adopted into her family. He frequently teases Chizuru about her age which results in her getting visibly annoyed. Initially Tayura was jealous of the relationship between his sister and Kouta prompting Chizuru to say that he is suffering from a [[Complex (psychology)|sister complex]]. He ends up falling in love with Akane but whenever he tries to get closer to her, he is given the cold shoulder.

Due to her position as [[Class president|class representative]] she has a high sense of regulations, and therefore disagrees with how ardently Chizuru pursues Kouta while at school.

The girls are nearly identical except for their slightly different hair styles.

On his first day at his new school, he meets a beautiful second-year female student named Chizuru Minamoto. Chizuru asks him to meet her alone in the music room. When he arrives, she tells him that she is in love with him and accidentally reveals to him that she is in fact a [[kitsune|fox spirit]]. Chizuru constantly and openly flirts with Kouta, even in front of others, embarrassing him greatly. Soon after the story begins, a wolf spirit named Nozomu Ezomori transfers into Kouta's school and class. From day one, she is all over Kouta, serving to embarrass him more and causing Chizuru to become annoyed at her new competition for Kouta's affection.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|Kouta Oyamada|\u5c0f\u5c71\u7530 \u8015\u592a|Oyamada K\u014dta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamiko Noto]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118161848/http://www.kanokon.com/staffcast.html|archivedate=January 18, 2013|url=http://www.kanokon.com/staffcast.html|title=Staff & Cast|publisher=www.kanokon.com|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}</ref>|[[Mona Marshall]]}}\n:Kouta is the protagonist of the story.

He is initially reluctant to engage in the \"intimate\" acts Chizuru desires, but does so later on in the series citing her inspiration. Kouta's true bond with Chizuru is shown when they fuse into a powerful being that gives Kouta black fox ears with tails. According to Chizuru's brother Tayura, this possession can only happen if a human and a [[y\u014dkai]] share a deep emotional bond with each other.<ref>{{cite book|title=Kanokon Omnibus 1-2|author=Katsumi Nishino|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]|date=April 16, 2013|chapter=1|pages=79-80|ISBN=978-1-9378-6735-5}}</ref>\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chizuru Minamoto|\u6e90 \u5343\u9db4|Minamoto Chizuru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayako Kawasumi]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast\"/>|[[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tower.com/kanokon-girl-who-cried-fox-tv-ova-collection-n-a-dvd/wapi/122152628|title=DVD: Kanokon: The Girl Who Cried Fox TV & OVA Collection (DVD) with Ayako Kawasumi, Dorothy Elias-Fahn, Mamiko Noto, Mona Marshall|author=|date=|work=Tower.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\n:Chizuru is second-year female student at Kouta's school. On the outside she appears to be a well endowed teenage girl, but she is in fact a powerful [[kitsune]]. When she changes form, her black hair turns blonde, and she gains fox ears and a tail. While it is implied by her brother Tayura that she is 400 years old, it is later revealed that her age may be in the thousands. She has no recollection of her past from before she met her foster mother Tamamo, but over time remembers some things she had forgotten about herself. From the start of the series she has fallen in love with Kouta, and is constantly hanging around him. She very much wants to enter into a \"relationship of sin\" with him and is very forthright in her almost constant sexual suggestions and actions.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nozomu Ezomori|\u72b9\u5b88 \u671b|Ezomori Nozomu}}\n:{{Voiced by|Miy\u016b Takeuchi<ref name=\"Japanese cast\"/>|May Kao}}\n:Nozomu is a first-year female transfer student at Kouta's school. She has short light ash blonde hair and is in fact a 200-year-old wolf spirit who lives by herself in an expensive but empty [[penthouse apartment]], where she always sleeps naked on the floor.
