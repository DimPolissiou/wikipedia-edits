Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Steam ===\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?d=UmMx9ixu90kC&pg=PA190&dq=electrical+power+generators+steam+percent&hl=en&ei=JppoTpVexNmBB4C72MkM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=steam&f=false|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n=== External combustion ===\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&hl=en|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Sintz in America built several commercially available engines from 1893. About 1895 the inboard oil engine emerged for small boats.  From this, hundreds of small boat engine manufactures set up shop: [[Bolinder (company)|Bolinder]], [[Gray Marine Engine]], Kermath, [[Union Iron Works]], Caille, Palmer, Red Wing, St. Lawrence, and Buda; Sulzer, B and W, Gardner, and Ailsa Craig to mention a few.  [[Two-stroke engine|Two-stroke engines]] were popular for many years, however, the  parallel development of the auto engine, with their many cylinders, became a natural transposition.  Chrysler, Ford, [[Packard]], and Hudson also made marine engines.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Sailing yachts==\n[[Image:Aerial view Yacht Harbour Residence Rostock Yachthafenresidenz Hohe D\u00fcne 1.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial view of a [[yacht club]] and [[marina]] - ''Yacht Harbour Residence \"Hohe D\u00fcne\"'' in [[Rostock]], Germany]]{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}{{main|Sailing yacht}}\n[[Image:CS30.jpg|thumb|right|A small [[sailing yacht]]]]\n\nSailing yachts can range in overall length ([[length overall]]\u2014LOA) from about {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} to well over {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}, where the distinction between a yacht and a ship becomes blurred. Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[File:80 foot motor yacht Alchemist photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|350px|The Lazzara 80-foot ''Alchemist'' on the California Coast]]\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake.

It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Steam ===\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?d=UmMx9ixu90kC&pg=PA190&dq=electrical+power+generators+steam+percent&hl=en&ei=JppoTpVexNmBB4C72MkM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=steam&f=false|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n=== External combustion ===\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&hl=en|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Sintz in America built several commercially available engines from 1893. About 1895 the inboard oil engine emerged for small boats.  From this, hundreds of small boat engine manufactures set up shop: [[Bolinder (company)|Bolinder]], [[Gray Marine Engine]], Kermath, [[Union Iron Works]], Caille, Palmer, Red Wing, St. Lawrence, and Buda; Sulzer, B and W, Gardner, and Ailsa Craig to mention a few.  [[Two-stroke engine|Two-stroke engines]] were popular for many years, however, the  parallel development of the auto engine, with their many cylinders, became a natural transposition.  Chrysler, Ford, [[Packard]], and Hudson also made marine engines.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Sailing yachts==\n[[Image:Aerial view Yacht Harbour Residence Rostock Yachthafenresidenz Hohe D\u00fcne 1.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial view of a [[yacht club]] and [[marina]] - ''Yacht Harbour Residence \"Hohe D\u00fcne\"'' in [[Rostock]], Germany]]{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}{{main|Sailing yacht}}\n[[Image:CS30.jpg|thumb|right|A small [[sailing yacht]]]]\n\nSailing yachts can range in overall length ([[length overall]]\u2014LOA) from about {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} to well over {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}, where the distinction between a yacht and a ship becomes blurred. Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

Their first product, the Fairlight, was a glass-fibre body shell priced at \u00a349 for fitting to a Ford 8 or 10&nbsp;hp chassis.<ref name=car_mechanics>{{cite book |last= |first= |title=Car Mechanics magazine advert |year=1959}}</ref> The first car, not destined for production, which subsequently became known as the Ginetta G1, was based on a pre-war [[Wolseley Hornet six]].<ref name=Beaulieu>{{cite book |last=Georgano |first=N.   | authorlink=G.N. Georgano |title=Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile |year=2000 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |isbn=1-57958-293-1}}</ref>\n\nThe four Walklett brothers each had their areas of expertise: Bob was the Managing Director, Douglas was the mechanical engineer and also handled the electrical work, Ivor was the designer and Trevers was the stylist, working closely with Ivor.\n\nFrom their original base, the company moved to [[Witham]], [[Essex]], in 1962, and between 1972 and 1974 operated from larger premises in Ballingdon Street adjacent to the railway bridge [[Sudbury, Suffolk]], before returning to Witham. In 1988, the Walklett brothers needed bigger premises and so moved the company to [[Scunthorpe]] where they could expand. On 7 November 1989, the Walkletts sold Ginetta to an international group of enthusiasts, based in [[Sheffield]] and run by managing director Martin Phaff. Ginetta was in a strong financial position at the time of its sale and the Walkletts went on to retire.\n\nUnder Phaff, the company went on to produce the Ginetta G20 and the Ginetta G33. It was during this period that the company hit troubled times.\n\n===21st century===\nIn late 2005, Ginetta was acquired by LNT Automotive, a company run by race car driver, engineer and businessman [[Lawrence Tomlinson]]. His aims were in line with the founders; to produce innovative, capable and great value sports cars.\n\nIn mid-2007, Ginetta moved to a factory near Leeds, with a target to sell 200 cars per year. Tomlinson himself penned the base specification for the [[Ginetta G50]], which marked 50 years of Ginetta production and became a successful [[GT4 European Cup|GT4]] car.\n\nIn March 2010, Ginetta acquired the [[Somerset]]-based sports car manufacturer Farbio, and re-badged their car as the [[Ginetta F400]]. In March 2011, Ginetta launched the [[Ginetta G55|G55]], which competed in the [[Michelin]] [[Ginetta GT Supercup]] and was built to comply to the GT3 class regulations. In October 2011, Ginetta launched the [[Ginetta G60|G60]], a two-door mid-engine sports car developed from the F400 and powered by a Ford-sourced 3.7-litre V6 engine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Drives/Search-Results/First-drives/Ginetta-G60-2011-CAR-review/|title=Ginetta G60 (2011) CAR review|accessdate=21 October 2011|publisher=Car Magazine|date=21 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\nModels produced by Ginetta include the following:\n\n===G2===\nGinetta's first car, the G2, was produced as a [[kit car]] for enthusiasts and consisted of a tubular frame chassis to take Ford components and aluminium body. About 100 were produced.\n\n===G3 and G4===\n[[File:Markg4.jpg|thumb|right|1964-1968 Ginetta G4R]]\nThe G3 was introduced with a glass fibre body in 1959 to be followed by the G4 in 1961.<ref>For road test see ''Motor Sport'', September 1962, Pages 690, 693.</ref>\n\nThe G4 used the new Ford 105E engine and had a glass fibre GT-style body along with the suspension updated to coil springing at the front with a Ford live axle at the rear. Whereas the G2 and G3 had been designed for racing, the G4 was usable as an everyday car but still was very competitive in motor sport with numerous successes. In 1963, a coup\u00e9 variant was introduced alongside the open top variant and a BMC axle replaced the Ford unit at the rear.<ref>''Motor Sport'', May 1963, Pages 345-346.</ref> In road tests, the car attains a top speed of  {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} with a 1,500&nbsp;cc engine.<ref>''Motor Sport'', April 1964, Pages 260-261.</ref> The series III version of 1966 added pop-up headlights. Production stopped in 1968 but was revived in 1981 with the Series IV which was two inches wider and three inches (76&nbsp;mm) longer than the III. Over 500 units were made up to 1969 with a variety of Ford engines. \n{{-}}\n\n===G10, G11 and G12===\n[[File:1965 Ginetta G12 sn 25.jpg|thumb|right|Ginetta G12]]\nLaunched at the 1965 Racing car show, the Ginetta G10 was meant to be a more powerful racing car than its predecessors. Weighing around {{cvt|900|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and fitted with a {{cvt|289|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine from the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], it was well received by the enthusiasts. Ginetta works driver Chris Meek secured a win with a prototype at the car's debut at Brands Hatch, beating a [[Jaguar E-Type]] which was considered to be the most successful GT racing car. However Ginetta failed to make a homologated version of the G10 in order for it to keep competing and as a result, it was forced out of the competition with a total production of only three cars. Following the reception the G10 had generated, Ginetta produced the G11, a street legal version of the G10 with the same body but with the Ford V8 replaced by the MGB 1800 engine. However, slow deliveries of the engine curbed production of the car and therefore only a handful were made.<ref>https://www.dkeng.co.uk/press/1451909267-94fe01c5a552f5a3b1ba64b0dcd53506.pdf|Ginetta G10 and G11</ref>\n\nUnveiled in 1966, the G12 was an evolution of the G4 but had many new features that made it stand apart from its predecessors. The car had a new tubular steel space frame chassis, with the cockpit section mounted to it for extra strength, while removable body work allowed for easy repair. The front suspension consisted of Triumph-derived uprights and double wishbones (with camber adjustment courtesy of rose-joints on the upper items) and coil springs. While, at the rear, the usual arrangement of single upper transverse links with lower reversed wishbones (with rose-joints) and radius arms was present, along with coil springs. The car was fitted with anti-roll bars for increased safety, and the Triumph-sourced Girling disc brakes at the front and rear ensured increased stopping power. Power came from a 1.0-litre Cosworth SCA [[inline-four engine]], though larger engines were fitted later such as an [[Aston Martin]] V8, but were less successful. The G12 dominated the competition in its class, outclassing [[Lotus Elan|Lotus Elan 26R]]s and [[Coventry Climax]]es, winning the 1,150&nbsp;cc MN series. Outside track racing, the G12 also found success at hill climb events, before it was replaced by the G16. Approximately 28 were built.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-2008/126/ginetta-g12|title=Ginetta G12|work=Motorsport Magazine|date=October 2008|accessdate=29 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===G15===\n{{main|Ginetta G15}}\n[[File:Ginetta G15 875cc August 1972.JPG|thumb|1969 [[Ginetta G15]]]]\nIn 1967 the [[Ginetta G15|G15]], utilizing a rear-mounted 875&nbsp;cc [[Sunbeam Imp]] engine, was launched.<ref name=Sedgwick>Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, page 82</ref> This two-seat coup\u00e9 had a glass fibre body bolted to a tube chassis and used Imp rear and Triumph front suspension.

The car largely used Rootes components.<ref name=Motor197010>{{cite journal| authorlink = Charles Bulmer (Ed)| title =Motor Show Number: Car by Car Guide and Ginetta advertisement| journal = [[The Motor|Motor]]| volume =  nbr 3565| pages = Pages 21 & 175 |date = 17 October 1970}}</ref> The 1.7-litre [[Sunbeam Rapier]] engine subsequently became the standard four-cylinder engine for the car. 80 cars in total were produced before production ceased in 1974 due to the oil crisis.

Called the GRS Tora Mark I it was first shown in October 1982, going on sale the next year. Although it was a two-door estate, it used the somewhat short front doors of a four-door Hunter, leading to limited rear seat access and somewhat awkward proportions. More troubling was that the Hunter's fuel tank and filler location meant that the rear gate opening was very high, limiting the cars utility. In October 1983, a GRS Tora Pickup was shown.<ref name=pyman2>[[#TP1|Pyman]], p. 6</ref> In August 1984 the GRS Tora Mark II started deliveries.<ref name=pyman2/> This version rectified the concerns with the rear opening, with a relocated fuel tank (and filler now mounted on the flank of the car) allowing for a full-height rear gate. Being more expensive than the simpler Mark I model the two were offered side by side. Sales of the GRS Tora helped Ginetta stay afloat in the 1980s, but by 1988 Tora production gradually came to a halt as the market was changing and donor cars were becoming rarer.\n\nAt the July 1989 Newark Kit Car Show, Ginetta showed a GRS Tora Mark III - unlike previous models, this was a four-door estate (of a rather beefy appearance) on [[Ford Cortina]] saloon underpinnings. It used the doors as well as the taillights of a Mark IV Cortina four-door saloon, and had Cortina engines or the option of a Perkins diesel. Only two were built, and Ginetta went back to its main business of making sports cars. All in all, about 320 Toras of all variants were built.<ref name=pyman1/>\n\n===G26, G27, G28, G30 and G31===\n{{multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = 200\n|image1= 1989 Ginetta G26 2.0 Front.jpg\n|caption1= Ginetta G26\n|image2= 1988 Ginetta G30 (front left).jpg\n|caption2= Ginetta G30\n|image3= Ginetta-G27-series3.jpg\n|caption3= Ginetta G27\n}}\nFollowing reorganisation, the company moved to [[Scunthorpe]] and started making cars in kit form again in the 1980s starting with the G27 and followed by the G26, G28, G30 and G31, with all cars using Ford parts. The G26 and G31 both used flip-up headlamps; the G26 and G30 were fastback coup\u00e9s while the G28 and G31 had a [[notchback]] profile.\n\nThe G27, which was introduced in November 1985, was a two-seater sports car derived from the G4.<ref name=Observer's_1986>John Bladon, The New Observer's Book of Automobiles, Twenty-ninth edition, 1986, page 79</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===G32 and G33===\n{{multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = 200\n|image1= Ginetta G33 V8.jpg\n|caption1= 1992 Ginetta G33\n|image2= G32 front.jpg\n|caption2= Ginetta G32\n}}\nIt was decided to re-enter the complete car business with the mid-engined [[Ginetta G32|G32]] with a choice of 1.6- or 1.9-litre four-cylinder engine, available as a coup\u00e9 or convertible and the G33 speedster which was equipped with a 3.9-litre [[Rover V8]] capable of a top speed of {{convert|145|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} and a 0-97&nbsp;km/h acceleration time of 5 seconds.

Their first product, the Fairlight, was a glass-fibre body shell priced at \u00a349 for fitting to a Ford 8 or 10&nbsp;hp chassis.<ref name=car_mechanics>{{cite book |last= |first= |title=Car Mechanics magazine advert |year=1959}}</ref> The first car, not destined for production, which subsequently became known as the Ginetta G1, was based on a pre-war [[Wolseley Hornet six]].<ref name=Beaulieu>{{cite book |last=Georgano |first=N.   | authorlink=G.N. Georgano |title=Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile |year=2000 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |isbn=1-57958-293-1}}</ref>\n\nThe four Walklett brothers each had their areas of expertise: Bob was the Managing Director, Douglas was the mechanical engineer and also handled the electrical work, Ivor was the designer and Trevers was the stylist, working closely with Ivor.\n\nFrom their original base, the company moved to [[Witham]], [[Essex]], in 1962, and between 1972 and 1974 operated from larger premises in Ballingdon Street adjacent to the railway bridge [[Sudbury, Suffolk]], before returning to Witham. In 1988, the Walklett brothers needed bigger premises and so moved the company to [[Scunthorpe]] where they could expand. On 7 November 1989, the Walkletts sold Ginetta to an international group of enthusiasts, based in [[Sheffield]] and run by managing director Martin Phaff. Ginetta was in a strong financial position at the time of its sale and the Walkletts went on to retire.\n\nUnder Phaff, the company went on to produce the Ginetta G20 and the Ginetta G33. It was during this period that the company hit troubled times.\n\n===21st century===\nIn late 2005, Ginetta was acquired by LNT Automotive, a company run by race car driver, engineer and businessman [[Lawrence Tomlinson]]. His aims were in line with the founders; to produce innovative, capable and great value sports cars.\n\nIn mid-2007, Ginetta moved to a factory near Leeds, with a target to sell 200 cars per year. Tomlinson himself penned the base specification for the [[Ginetta G50]], which marked 50 years of Ginetta production and became a successful [[GT4 European Cup|GT4]] car.\n\nIn March 2010, Ginetta acquired the [[Somerset]]-based sports car manufacturer Farbio, and re-badged their car as the [[Ginetta F400]]. In March 2011, Ginetta launched the [[Ginetta G55|G55]], which competed in the [[Michelin]] [[Ginetta GT Supercup]] and was built to comply to the GT3 class regulations. In October 2011, Ginetta launched the [[Ginetta G60|G60]], a two-door mid-engine sports car developed from the F400 and powered by a Ford-sourced 3.7-litre V6 engine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Drives/Search-Results/First-drives/Ginetta-G60-2011-CAR-review/|title=Ginetta G60 (2011) CAR review|accessdate=21 October 2011|publisher=Car Magazine|date=21 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\nModels produced by Ginetta include the following:\n\n===G2===\nGinetta's first car, the G2, was produced as a [[kit car]] for enthusiasts and consisted of a tubular frame chassis to take Ford components and aluminium body. About 100 were produced.\n\n===G3 and G4===\n[[File:Markg4.jpg|thumb|right|1964-1968 Ginetta G4R]]\nThe G3 was introduced with a glass fibre body in 1959 to be followed by the G4 in 1961.<ref>For road test see ''Motor Sport'', September 1962, Pages 690, 693.</ref>\n\nThe G4 used the new Ford 105E engine and had a glass fibre GT-style body along with the suspension updated to coil springing at the front with a Ford live axle at the rear. Whereas the G2 and G3 had been designed for racing, the G4 was usable as an everyday car but still was very competitive in motor sport with numerous successes. In 1963, a coup\u00e9 variant was introduced alongside the open top variant and a BMC axle replaced the Ford unit at the rear.<ref>''Motor Sport'', May 1963, Pages 345-346.</ref> In road tests, the car attains a top speed of  {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} with a 1,500&nbsp;cc engine.<ref>''Motor Sport'', April 1964, Pages 260-261.</ref> The series III version of 1966 added pop-up headlights. Production stopped in 1968 but was revived in 1981 with the Series IV which was two inches wider and three inches (76&nbsp;mm) longer than the III. Over 500 units were made up to 1969 with a variety of Ford engines. \n{{-}}\n\n===G10, G11 and G12===\n[[File:1965 Ginetta G12 sn 25.jpg|thumb|right|Ginetta G12]]\nLaunched at the 1965 Racing car show, the Ginetta G10 was meant to be a more powerful racing car than its predecessors. Weighing around {{cvt|900|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and fitted with a {{cvt|289|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine from the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], it was well received by the enthusiasts. Ginetta works driver Chris Meek secured a win with a prototype at the car's debut at Brands Hatch, beating a [[Jaguar E-Type]] which was considered to be the most successful GT racing car. However Ginetta failed to make a homologated version of the G10 in order for it to keep competing and as a result, it was forced out of the competition with a total production of only three cars. Following the reception the G10 had generated, Ginetta produced the G11, a street legal version of the G10 with the same body but with the Ford V8 replaced by the MGB 1800 engine. However, slow deliveries of the engine curbed production of the car and therefore only a handful were made.<ref>https://www.dkeng.co.uk/press/1451909267-94fe01c5a552f5a3b1ba64b0dcd53506.pdf|Ginetta G10 and G11</ref>\n\nUnveiled in 1966, the G12 was an evolution of the G4 but had many new features that made it stand apart from its predecessors. The car had a new tubular steel space frame chassis, with the cockpit section mounted to it for extra strength, while removable body work allowed for easy repair. The front suspension consisted of Triumph-derived uprights and double wishbones (with camber adjustment courtesy of rose-joints on the upper items) and coil springs. While, at the rear, the usual arrangement of single upper transverse links with lower reversed wishbones (with rose-joints) and radius arms was present, along with coil springs. The car was fitted with anti-roll bars for increased safety, and the Triumph-sourced Girling disc brakes at the front and rear ensured increased stopping power. Power came from a 1.0-litre Cosworth SCA [[inline-four engine]], though larger engines were fitted later such as an [[Aston Martin]] V8, but were less successful. The G12 dominated the competition in its class, outclassing [[Lotus Elan|Lotus Elan 26R]]s and [[Coventry Climax]]es, winning the 1,150&nbsp;cc MN series. Outside track racing, the G12 also found success at hill climb events, before it was replaced by the G16. Approximately 28 were built.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-2008/126/ginetta-g12|title=Ginetta G12|work=Motorsport Magazine|date=October 2008|accessdate=29 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===G15===\n{{main|Ginetta G15}}\n[[File:Ginetta G15 875cc August 1972.JPG|thumb|1969 [[Ginetta G15]]]]\nIn 1967 the [[Ginetta G15|G15]], utilizing a rear-mounted 875&nbsp;cc [[Sunbeam Imp]] engine, was launched.<ref name=Sedgwick>Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, page 82</ref> This two-seat coup\u00e9 had a glass fibre body bolted to a tube chassis and used Imp rear and Triumph front suspension.

Called the GRS Tora Mark I it was first shown in October 1982, going on sale the next year. Although it was a two-door estate, it used the somewhat short front doors of a four-door Hunter, leading to limited rear seat access and somewhat awkward proportions. More troubling was that the Hunter's fuel tank and filler location meant that the rear gate opening was very high, limiting the cars utility. In October 1983, a GRS Tora Pickup was shown.<ref name=pyman2>[[#TP1|Pyman]], p. 6</ref> In August 1984 the GRS Tora Mark II started deliveries.<ref name=pyman2/> This version rectified the concerns with the rear opening, with a relocated fuel tank (and filler now mounted on the flank of the car) allowing for a full-height rear gate. Being more expensive than the simpler Mark I model the two were offered side by side. Sales of the GRS Tora helped Ginetta stay afloat in the 1980s, but by 1988 Tora production gradually came to a halt as the market was changing and donor cars were becoming rarer.\n\nAt the July 1989 Newark Kit Car Show, Ginetta showed a GRS Tora Mark III - unlike previous models, this was a four-door estate (of a rather beefy appearance) on [[Ford Cortina]] saloon underpinnings. It used the doors as well as the taillights of a Mark IV Cortina four-door saloon, and had Cortina engines or the option of a Perkins diesel. Only two were built, and Ginetta went back to its main business of making sports cars.

In 2009 it moved to support the BTCC. In 2011, with the introduction of the Ginetta G55, the championship became the [[Ginetta GT4 Supercup|Michelin Ginetta GT4 SuperCup]].\n\nThe 2014 season will be the fourth running of the Michelin Ginetta GT4 Supercup, but it will be the first year in which the G50 GT4 and G55 GT4 cars are consolidated into one single class. In order to maintain fair competition, the two models will be equalised through a balance of performance test.\n\n===Protyre Motorsport Ginetta GT5 Challenge===\n{{main|Ginetta GT5 Challenge}}\n\nThe Protyre Motorsport [[Ginetta GT5 Challenge]] offers a unique, low-cost opportunity to race in a single-make racing championship, over seven race weekends supporting the [[British GT]] package. For 2014, the series will once again return to Spa for an international round alongside the Swedish Ginetta Challenge series.\n\nA popular entry-level championship for many GT racers, the series boasts packed grids with close racing. All weekends are triple headers, providing 21 races throughout the season, with all races counting towards the final championship positions.\n\n===Prototype===\n[[File:GinettaG60LTP1lemans2018.jpg|thumb|[[Ginetta G60-LT-P1]]]]\n\nGinetta supplies customer [[LMP3]] cars for the [[European Le Mans Series]] and [[Asian Le Mans Series]] as well as the [[IMSA Prototype Challenge]]. \n\nIn 2017 Ginetta developed a [[LMP1]] class car the [[Ginetta G60-LT-P1]].<ref>http://sportscar365.com/lemans/wec/ginetta-announces-lmp1-chassis-for-2018/</ref> \nFor the 2018\u201319 FIA World Endurance Championship season Ginetta entered 2 G60-LT-P1 in the WEC series in conjunction with TRSM Racing Manor. \nAt the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans, the #5 car finished 5th in class, while the #6 car retired after 10 hours due to persistent electrical issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.motorsport.com/wec/news/manor-ginetta-solid-building-block-1054780/|title= Ginetta LMP1 a solid building block for ManorDriver line up|publisher= Motorsports.com |date=2 July 2018 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref> \n\n{{-}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | author=Walklett, Bob | title=Ginetta - The Inside Story: 31 Years of British Specialist Car Manufacturer | publisher=Bookmarque Publishing | year=1994 | isbn=1-870519-28-0}}\n*{{cite book | author=Rose, John | title=Ginetta: The Illustrated History   | publisher=G T Foulis & Co Ltd | year=1988 | isbn=0-85429-685-9}}\n*{{cite book | author=Pyman, T | title=History of the Ginetta G4   | publisher=Bookmarque Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-870519-69-8}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ginetta vehicles}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070104151925/http://www.ginettacars.com/ Official '''Ginetta Cars''' website]\n* [http://www.ginetta.org Ginetta Owners Club]\n* [http://www.ginetta.com Ginetta Racing Site]\n* [http://en.ginetta-club.com/ Ginetta Club] {{in lang|en}}\n\n{{Ginetta Cars |state=collapsed}}\n{{Automotive industry in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Ginetta seasons}}\n\n[[Category:Ginetta vehicles| ]]\n[[Category:Car manufacturers of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Leeds]]\n[[Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1958]]\n[[Category:1958 establishments in England]]\n", "name_user": "Mr.choppers", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eG26, G27, G28, G30 and G31:WL", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginetta_Cars"}
