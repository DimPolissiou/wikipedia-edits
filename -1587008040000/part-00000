However, this golden bird was destroyed due to several invasions. \n\nThe introduction follows up with a young Tanhaji Malusare learning sword fight under his father.  After winning a sword fight and a duel between his father, the plot thickens.\n\n[[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] has escaped from the house arrest of Mughals but had to hand over his precious forts to [[Aurangzeb]]. [[Kondhana]] ([[Sinhagad|Singhad]]) is included too. Aurangzeb thus appoints Udaybhan Singh Rathod, a Rajput, to be the [[Kiladar|Killedar]] or fort keeper of Kondhana with the intention of making Kondhana the capital of the South. Shivaji Maharaj prepares to take back Kondhana, Tanhaji Malusare, unaware of the situation comes to Rajgad to invite the Maharaj for his son's - Raiba's - wedding. He eventually finds out due to the treacherous intentions of fellow ministers in the Maharaj's council and decides that Kondhana is more important than his son's wedding.\n\nAfter thorough planning, Tanhaji Malusare decides to attack Udaybhan before he can reach Kondhana. The attempt fails and Udaybhan along with Naagin, a fictional long canon, reaches Kondhana. Thus begins Tanhaji's actual battle of reconnaissance of the Kondhana fort, its secret doors and the actual war. After taking 300 mavalas with him, he climbs the Kondhana fort with Suryaji Malusare (brother of Tanhaji Malusare) and Shelar Mama (uncle of Tanhaji Malusare) along with 400 mavalas waits at the Kalyan Darwaza. A group of Marathas opens the Kalyan Darwaza and the Marathas rush into the fort. Tanhaji and the mavalas enter through the Pune Darwaza by sheer bravery and battle begins with Udaybhan singlehandedly destroying the Marathas. After the battle and exhilarating background music, the duel between Udaybhan and Tanhaji starts. While Tanhaji cuts the fire to the Naagin canon in mid-air, Udaybhan cuts his fore-arm. After wrapping his turban around his fore-arm he pushes Udaybhan along with Naagin down the fort. Shivaji Maharaj rushes onto Kondhana and Tanhaji dies in his presence.\n\nThe film ends with Tanhaji's wife Savitribai welcoming him in bridal attire, as she had promised him that she would grant any of his wishes if he won Kondhana and his wish was for her to come to him dressed up as a bride.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ajay Devgn]] as [[Tanaji Malusare]]\n* [[Saif Ali Khan]] as [[Uday Bhan|Udaybhan Singh Rathore]] \n* [[Kajol]] as Savitribai Malusare \n* [[Sharad Kelkar]] as [[Shivaji|Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]]\n* [[Luke Kenny]] as [[Aurangzeb]]\n* [[Vipul Gupta]] as Jagat Singh \n* Padmavati Rao as [[Jijabai|Rajmata Jijabai]] \n* [[Shashank Shende]] as Shelaar Mama\n* [[Devdatta Nage]] as Suryaji Malusare \n* [[Neha Sharma]] as Kamla Devi \n* [[Ajinkya Deo]] as Chandraji Pisal\n* Yuri Suri as [[Jai Singh I|Mirza Raje Jai Singh]]\n* Jagannath Nivangune as Kaloji Malusare \n* Trisha Patil as Parvatibai \"Parvati\" Malusare \n* Hardik Sangani as Gondya\n* [[Nissar Khan]] as Beshak Khan\n* Prasanna Ketkar as Sarnaik\n* Kailash Waghmare as Chultiya\n* Harsh Sharma as Young Tanhaji\n* Ranav Sharma as Young Suryaji\n* Arush Nand as Raiba Malusare\n* Dhairyasheel Gholap as Shrubhau\n* Nilesh Lalwani as Tatya\n* Pramod More as Leader of Gondia\n* Bhagyashree Nhalve as Suryaji's wife\n* Devendra Gaikwad as Raiba's father-in-law\n* Rajesh Ahir as Raja Sangram Singh\n\n== [https://blog.biographypro.xyz/2020/04/tanhaji-unsung-warrior-2020-review.html Production] ==\n[[Pre-production]] began on 20 July 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/ajay-devgn-reveals-first-look-of-taanaji-the-unsung-warrior/story-JLG1bg6gPEWhTGhRZ0PIuJ.html|title=Ajay Devgn reveals first look of Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior|date=2017-07-20|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] commenced from 25 September 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/TSeries/status/1044483007912992769/|title=TSeries on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Marketing and release ==\nEarlier marketed as ''Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior'', it was revealed on Twitter by [[Ajay Devgn]] that the film will be known as ''Tanhaji''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In December 2017, the release date of ''Tanhaji'' was revealed as 22 November 2019 but was postponed to December 2019 due to shooting problems.

However, this golden bird was destroyed due to several invasions. \n\nThe introduction follows up with a young Tanhaji Malusare learning sword fight under his father.  After winning a sword fight and a duel between his father, the plot thickens.\n\n[[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] has escaped from the house arrest of Mughals but had to hand over his precious forts to [[Aurangzeb]]. [[Kondhana]] ([[Sinhagad|Singhad]]) is included too. Aurangzeb thus appoints Udaybhan Singh Rathod, a Rajput, to be the [[Kiladar|Killedar]] or fort keeper of Kondhana with the intention of making Kondhana the capital of the South. Shivaji Maharaj prepares to take back Kondhana, Tanhaji Malusare, unaware of the situation comes to Rajgad to invite the Maharaj for his son's - Raiba's - wedding. He eventually finds out due to the treacherous intentions of fellow ministers in the Maharaj's council and decides that Kondhana is more important than his son's wedding.\n\nAfter thorough planning, Tanhaji Malusare decides to attack Udaybhan before he can reach Kondhana. The attempt fails and Udaybhan along with Naagin, a fictional long canon, reaches Kondhana. Thus begins Tanhaji's actual battle of reconnaissance of the Kondhana fort, its secret doors and the actual war. After taking 300 mavalas with him, he climbs the Kondhana fort with Suryaji Malusare (brother of Tanhaji Malusare) and Shelar Mama (uncle of Tanhaji Malusare) along with 400 mavalas waits at the Kalyan Darwaza. A group of Marathas opens the Kalyan Darwaza and the Marathas rush into the fort. Tanhaji and the mavalas enter through the Pune Darwaza by sheer bravery and battle begins with Udaybhan singlehandedly destroying the Marathas. After the battle and exhilarating background music, the duel between Udaybhan and Tanhaji starts. While Tanhaji cuts the fire to the Naagin canon in mid-air, Udaybhan cuts his fore-arm. After wrapping his turban around his fore-arm he pushes Udaybhan along with Naagin down the fort. Shivaji Maharaj rushes onto Kondhana and Tanhaji dies in his presence.\n\nThe film ends with Tanhaji's wife Savitribai welcoming him in bridal attire, as she had promised him that she would grant any of his wishes if he won Kondhana and his wish was for her to come to him dressed up as a bride.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ajay Devgn]] as [[Tanaji Malusare]]\n* [[Saif Ali Khan]] as [[Uday Bhan|Udaybhan Singh Rathore]] \n* [[Kajol]] as Savitribai Malusare \n* [[Sharad Kelkar]] as [[Shivaji|Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]]\n* [[Luke Kenny]] as [[Aurangzeb]]\n* [[Vipul Gupta]] as Jagat Singh \n* Padmavati Rao as [[Jijabai|Rajmata Jijabai]] \n* [[Shashank Shende]] as Shelaar Mama\n* [[Devdatta Nage]] as Suryaji Malusare \n* [[Neha Sharma]] as Kamla Devi \n* [[Ajinkya Deo]] as Chandraji Pisal\n* Yuri Suri as [[Jai Singh I|Mirza Raje Jai Singh]]\n* Jagannath Nivangune as Kaloji Malusare \n* Trisha Patil as Parvatibai \"Parvati\" Malusare \n* Hardik Sangani as Gondya\n* [[Nissar Khan]] as Beshak Khan\n* Prasanna Ketkar as Sarnaik\n* Kailash Waghmare as Chultiya\n* Harsh Sharma as Young Tanhaji\n* Ranav Sharma as Young Suryaji\n* Arush Nand as Raiba Malusare\n* Dhairyasheel Gholap as Shrubhau\n* Nilesh Lalwani as Tatya\n* Pramod More as Leader of Gondia\n* Bhagyashree Nhalve as Suryaji's wife\n* Devendra Gaikwad as Raiba's father-in-law\n* Rajesh Ahir as Raja Sangram Singh\n\n== Production ==\n[[Pre-production]] began on 20 July 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/ajay-devgn-reveals-first-look-of-taanaji-the-unsung-warrior/story-JLG1bg6gPEWhTGhRZ0PIuJ.html|title=Ajay Devgn reveals first look of Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior|date=2017-07-20|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] commenced from 25 September 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/TSeries/status/1044483007912992769/|title=TSeries on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Marketing and release ==\nEarlier marketed as ''Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior'', it was revealed on Twitter by [[Ajay Devgn]] that the film will be known as ''Tanhaji''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In December 2017, the release date of ''Tanhaji'' was revealed as 22 November 2019 but was postponed to December 2019 due to shooting problems.
