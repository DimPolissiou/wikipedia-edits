In 1977, Maddux broke up with Einhorn and went to [[New York City]], where she became involved with Saul Lapidus. On September 9, 1977, Maddux returned to the Philadelphia apartment she had previously shared with Einhorn to collect her belongings (which Einhorn had reportedly threatened to throw out into the street as trash) and was never seen again. Several weeks later, the [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia police]] questioned Einhorn about her disappearance. He claimed that Maddux had gone out to the neighborhood co-op to buy some [[tofu]] and [[Bean sprouts|sprouts]], and never returned.\n\nEinhorn's initial [[alibi]] came into question when his neighbors began complaining about a foul smell coming from his apartment, which in turn aroused the suspicion of authorities. Eighteen months later, on March 28, 1979, Maddux's [[human decomposition|decomposing]] corpse was found by police in a trunk stored in Einhorn's closet. After finding the body, a police officer reportedly said to Einhorn, \"It looks like we found Holly,\" to which he reportedly replied, \"You found what you found.\" Einhorn's [[bail]] was reduced to $40,000 at the request of his attorney [[Arlen Specter]]; he was released from custody in advance of his trial by paying 10% of the bond's value, or $4,000. This amount was paid by socialite [[Phyllis Lambert]], one of the many people Einhorn had convinced to support him financially.\n\nIn 1981, just days before his murder trial was to begin, Einhorn skipped bail and fled to [[Europe]]. He lived there for the next seventeen years and married a [[Sweden|Swedish]] woman named Annika Flodin. Back in [[Pennsylvania]], as Einhorn had already been [[arraignment|arraigned]], the state convicted him ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for Maddux's murder in 1996. Einhorn was sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] without the possibility of [[parole]].\n\n==Extradition==\nThroughout Ira Einhorn's fugitive flight he was supported by the wealthy Canadian Bronfman family,  heirs to the whisky fortune. Others, friends of the Bronfmans, joined them in supporting Einhorn, indifferent to or doubtful of his murder of his ex-girlfriend Holly.\n\nIn 1997, Einhorn was arrested in [[Champagne-Mouton]], [[France]], where he had been living under the name \"Eug\u00e8ne Mallon\". The [[extradition]] process, however, proved more complex than initially envisioned. Under the extradition treaty between France and the US, either country may refuse extradition under certain circumstances, and Einhorn used multiple avenues to avoid extradition.\n\nAlthough Einhorn was not [[death penalty|sentenced to death]], his defense attorneys argued that he would face the death penalty if he were returned to the US. France, like many countries that have abolished the death penalty, does not extradite defendants to jurisdictions that retain the death penalty without assurance that it will be neither sought nor applied. Pennsylvania authorities pointed out that when the murder occurred, the state did not practice the death penalty and so Einhorn could not be executed because the state and federal constitutions forbid ''[[ex post facto]]'' law. Einhorn's next strategy involved French law and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which require a new trial when the defendant was tried ''in absentia'' and unable to present his [[defense (law)|defense]]. On this basis, the court of appeals of [[Bordeaux]] rejected the extradition request.\n\nFollowing the court's decision, thirty-five members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] sent a letter to [[President of France|French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] to ask for Einhorn's extradition. However, under France's doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], which was invoked in this case, the President cannot give orders to courts and does not intervene in extradition affairs. Therefore, in 1998, to secure Einhorn's extradition, the Pennsylvania legislature passed a bill, nicknamed the \"Einhorn Law\", allowing defendants convicted ''in absentia'' to request another trial. In another delay tactic, Einhorn's attorneys criticized the bill as unconstitutional and tried to get the French courts to once again deny the extradition on the grounds that the law would be inapplicable. However, the French court ruled itself unable to evaluate the constitutionality of foreign laws. Another point of friction with the US was that the court freed Einhorn under police supervision, as French laws put restrictions on [[detention of suspects|remand]], the imprisonment of suspects awaiting trial. Einhorn then became the focus of intense surveillance by French police.\n\nThe matter went before [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]]; extraditions, after having been approved by courts, must be ordered by the executive. The [[French Green Party]] stated that Einhorn should not be extradited until the issues concerning his case were fully settled.<ref name=\"LesVerts\"><!-- this site no longer exists: {{cite web|url=http://www.les-verts.org/article.php3?id_article=224 |title=Les Verts \u2013 Ira Einhorn extrad\u00e9 }}--> {{cite web|url=http://www.lesverts.fr/spip.php?page=imprimir_articulo&id_article=224|title=Ira Einhorn extrad\u00e9|date=July 20, 2001|publisher=Les Verts|language=french|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026202806/http://www.lesverts.fr/spip.php?page=imprimir_articulo&id_article=224|archivedate=October 26, 2013|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> Jospin rejected the claims and issued an extradition [[decree]].

In 1977, Maddux broke up with Einhorn and went to [[New York City]], where she became involved with Saul Lapidus. On September 9, 1977, Maddux returned to the Philadelphia apartment she had previously shared with Einhorn to collect her belongings (which Einhorn had reportedly threatened to throw out into the street as trash) and was never seen again. Several weeks later, the [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia police]] questioned Einhorn about her disappearance. He claimed that Maddux had gone out to the neighborhood co-op to buy some [[tofu]] and [[Bean sprouts|sprouts]], and never returned.\n\nEinhorn's initial [[alibi]] came into question when his neighbors began complaining about a foul smell coming from his apartment, which in turn aroused the suspicion of authorities. Eighteen months later, on March 28, 1979, Maddux's [[human decomposition|decomposing]] corpse was found by police in a trunk stored in Einhorn's closet. After finding the body, a police officer reportedly said to Einhorn, \"It looks like we found Holly,\" to which he reportedly replied, \"You found what you found.\" Einhorn's [[bail]] was reduced to $40,000 at the request of his attorney [[Arlen Specter]]; he was released from custody in advance of his trial by paying 10% of the bond's value, or $4,000. This amount was paid by socialite [[Phyllis Lambert]], one of the many people Einhorn had convinced to support him financially.\n\nIn 1981, just days before his murder trial was to begin, Einhorn skipped bail and fled to [[Europe]]. He lived there for the next seventeen years and married a [[Sweden|Swedish]] woman named Annika Flodin. Back in [[Pennsylvania]], as Einhorn had already been [[arraignment|arraigned]], the state convicted him ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for Maddux's murder in 1996. Einhorn was sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] without the possibility of [[parole]].\n\n==Extradition==\nThroughout Ira Einhorn's fugitive flight he was supported by the wealthy Canadian Bronfman family,  heirs to the whisky fortune. Others, friends of the Bronfmans, joined them in supporting Einhorn, indifferent to doubtful of his murder of his ex-girlfriend Holly.\n\nIn 1997, Einhorn was arrested in [[Champagne-Mouton]], [[France]], where he had been living under the name \"Eug\u00e8ne Mallon\". The [[extradition]] process, however, proved more complex than initially envisioned. Under the extradition treaty between France and the US, either country may refuse extradition under certain circumstances, and Einhorn used multiple avenues to avoid extradition.\n\nAlthough Einhorn was not [[death penalty|sentenced to death]], his defense attorneys argued that he would face the death penalty if he were returned to the US. France, like many countries that have abolished the death penalty, does not extradite defendants to jurisdictions that retain the death penalty without assurance that it will be neither sought nor applied. Pennsylvania authorities pointed out that when the murder occurred, the state did not practice the death penalty and so Einhorn could not be executed because the state and federal constitutions forbid ''[[ex post facto]]'' law. Einhorn's next strategy involved French law and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which require a new trial when the defendant was tried ''in absentia'' and unable to present his [[defense (law)|defense]]. On this basis, the court of appeals of [[Bordeaux]] rejected the extradition request.\n\nFollowing the court's decision, thirty-five members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] sent a letter to [[President of France|French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] to ask for Einhorn's extradition. However, under France's doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], which was invoked in this case, the President cannot give orders to courts and does not intervene in extradition affairs. Therefore, in 1998, to secure Einhorn's extradition, the Pennsylvania legislature passed a bill, nicknamed the \"Einhorn Law\", allowing defendants convicted ''in absentia'' to request another trial. In another delay tactic, Einhorn's attorneys criticized the bill as unconstitutional and tried to get the French courts to once again deny the extradition on the grounds that the law would be inapplicable. However, the French court ruled itself unable to evaluate the constitutionality of foreign laws. Another point of friction with the US was that the court freed Einhorn under police supervision, as French laws put restrictions on [[detention of suspects|remand]], the imprisonment of suspects awaiting trial.

In 1964, his family fled the [[Zanzibar Revolution]], moving to [[Middlesex]], England. Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]]. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]\", \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", \"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\", and \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert. He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. He confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease, having been diagnosed in 1987. In 1992, [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|his tribute concert]] was held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\nAs a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2003, and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen members were awarded the [[Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and one year after his death Mercury was awarded it individually.<!-- This is what text says in article below --> In 2005, Queen were awarded an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]].

In 1964, his family fled the [[Zanzibar Revolution]], moving to [[Middlesex]], England. Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]]. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]\", \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", \"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\", and \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\".
