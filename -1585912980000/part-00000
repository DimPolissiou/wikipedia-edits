Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1480/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1480/>\n\nErnest DeBurgh, the designer of DeBurgh truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer with the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1480/>\n\nThe MacDonald River bridge at St Albans was built between 1901 and 1903 to replace an earlier bridge which had become unsafe. It was built by contractors John Ahearn and Sons of [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]] at a cost of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]7290 6[[Shilling (Australian)|s]] 11[[Australian penny|d]], under the supervision of the Commissioner for Roads, W.

Stromboli tries to catch the guests in a cage, but Jiminy Cricket warns riders of the trap and leads the car down an alley to safety. The ride then goes to [[Land of Toys|Pleasure Island]], which is filled with boys enjoying [[carnival ride]]s, and inside a [[pool hall]], where [[Candlewick (Pinocchio character)|Lampwick]] is turning into a [[donkey]]. Outside, behind Pleasure Island, [[the Coachman]] and his [[henchmen]] are caging the other boys who have become donkeys. The Coachman tries to trap the guests in a [[crate]] and send them to the [[salt mines]], but Jiminy Cricket leads them past the [[dock]]s, where [[The Terrible Dogfish#Disney version|Monstro the whale]] appears, and back to Pinocchio's village. Inside Geppetto's workshop, the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]] appears and disappears beside Geppetto and Pinocchio, and the ride vehicle travels through Geppetto's workshop, filled with animated clocks, toys and automatons, back to the station.\n\nThere's a \"[[Hidden Mickey]]\" in the final scene as the vehicle goes through the workshop; the top of a carved wooden display case holding a ship has a familiar pair of mouse ears.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sconlon |first1=Bill |title=The Hidden Mickeys of Disneyland |date=2015 |publisher=Disney Editions |isbn=978-1484712764 |page=23}}</ref>\n\n==Geppetto's shop==\nWhen the ride was built in 1983, it was paired with a souvenir shop located next to the attraction's exit. Geppetto's Arts & Crafts was a toy shop designed to look like the movie setting, selling wooden marionettes, old-fashioned figurines and cuckoo clocks. Over the years, the shop's merchandise shifted to more conventional plush toys, and in the mid-90s, the store's name was changed to Geppetto's Toys & Gifts. The shop closed in 2004, replaced briefly by a store called Names Unraveled.

The ride then goes to [[Land of Toys|Pleasure Island]], which is filled with boys enjoying [[carnival ride]]s, and inside a [[pool hall]], where [[Candlewick (Pinocchio character)|Lampwick]] is turning into a [[donkey]]. Outside, behind Pleasure Island, [[the Coachman]] and his [[henchmen]] is caging the other boys who have become donkeys. The Coachman tries to trap the guests in a [[crate]] and send them to the [[salt mines]], but Jiminy Cricket leads them past the [[dock]]s, where [[The Terrible Dogfish#Disney version|Monstro the whale]] appears, and back to Pinocchio's village.

Over the years, the shop's merchandise shifted to more conventional plush toys, and in the mid-90s, the store's name was changed to Geppetto's Toys & Gifts.

First admirals were mentioned in 14th century as commanders of the royal fleet of Croatian-Hungarian king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. Officers from today's Croatia served in various navies in control of Croatia or its parts. For instance, [[Jusuf Ma\u0161kovi\u0107]] served as a [[Kapudan Pasha|grand admiral]] of Ottoman Navy in 1630s, just like [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] in 1530s; [[Ivan of Vrana]] was a Venetian admiral in late 16th century, taking part in the [[Battle of Lepanto]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u010corali\u0107|first=Lovorka|last2=Prijatelj Pavi\u010di\u0107|first2=Ivana|date=2005-12-01|title=Ivan iz Vrane \u2013 mleta\u010dki admiral u Lepantskom boju (1571.)|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/12728|journal=Povijesni prilozi|language=hr|volume=24|issue=29|pages=127\u2013149|issn=0351-9767}}</ref> Croatian personnel served in the [[Venetian navy|Venetian Navy]] until its demise in 1797 and, in modern times, in Habsburg/[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as Croatia was a constituent part of the monarchy (until 1918). First Croatian admirals distinguished themselves commanding Habsburg ships in [[First Italian War of Independence]] in 1848.\n\nCroatian admirals helped lead Austro-Hungarian Navy through [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|World War I]] and later oversaw the creation and development of [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] in the interwar years (1918-1941). In World War II they found themselves on opposing sides, as some chose to collaborate and joined rather limited Navy of Independent State of Croatia (1941\u201345), while others founded guerilla [[Yugoslav Partisans#Partisan Navy|Partisan Navy]], which liberated the Croatian Adriatic and later developed into [[Yugoslav Navy]] (1942\u201391). Croatian admirals led Yugoslav Navy during the Cold War, overseeing its development of submarines and strengthening its capacities. After 1991, breaking off from Yugoslav Navy, Croatian admirals steered Croatian Navy through the [[Croatian War of Independence]] from Yugoslavia (1991-5).\n\nWhat follows is a list of naval officers '''from the territory of today's Republic of Croatia'''. For a list of admirals of the modern, post-1991 [[Croatian Navy]], see [[List of Croatian Navy admirals]].

First admirals were mentioned in 14th century as commanders of the royal fleet of Croatian-Hungarian king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. Officers from today's Croatia served in various navies in control of Croatia or its parts. For instance, [[Jusuf Ma\u0161kovi\u0107]] served as a [[Kapudan Pasha|grand admiral]] of Ottoman Navy in 1630s, just like [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] in 1530s; [[Ivan of Vrana]] was a Venetian admiral in late 16th century, taking part in the [[Battle of Lepanto]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u010corali\u0107|first=Lovorka|last2=Prijatelj Pavi\u010di\u0107|first2=Ivana|date=2005-12-01|title=Ivan iz Vrane \u2013 mleta\u010dki admiral u Lepantskom boju (1571.)|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/12728|journal=Povijesni prilozi|language=hr|volume=24|issue=29|pages=127\u2013149|issn=0351-9767}}</ref> Croatian personnel served in the [[Venetian navy|Venetian Navy]] until its demise in 1797 and, in modern times, in Habsburg/[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as Croatia was a constituent part of the monarchy (until 1918). First Croatian admirals distinguished themselves commanding Habsburg ships in [[First Italian War of Independence]] in 1848.\n\nCroatian admirals helped lead Austro-Hungarian Navy through [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|World War I]] and later oversaw the creation and development of [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] in the interwar years (1918-1941). In World War II they found themselves on opposing sides, as some chose to collaborate and joined rather limited Navy of Independent State of Croatia (1941\u201345), while others founded guerilla [[Yugoslav Partisans#Partisan Navy|Partisan Navy]], which liberated the Croatian Adriatic and later developed into [[Yugoslav Navy]] (1942\u201391). Croatian admirals led Yugoslav Navy during the Cold War, overseeing its development of submarines and strengthening its capacities. After 1991, breaking off from Yugoslav Navy, Croatian admirals steered Croatian Navy through the [[Croatian War of Independence]] from Yugoslavia (1991-5).\n\nWhat follows is a list of naval officers '''from the territory of today's Republic of Croatia'''. For a list of admirals of the modern, post-1991 [[Croatian Navy]], see [[List of Croatian Navy admirals]]. [[Croats of Boka Kotorska|Historical Croat community in Boka Kotorska]] has produced a long line of admirals (Russian Grand admiral [[Matija Zmajevi\u0107]], Austrian vice-admiral [https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Bujacovich,_Alexander_Freiherr Aleksandar Bujakovi\u0107] (1792-1870) etc.), but these are excluded from this list.\n\n==Admiral flote==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horisontal\n| image1   = Zastava admirala flote OS RH.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>1991\u2013</small></center>\n| width1     = 70\n| image2   = SFR Yugoslavia Fleet Admiral.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>1956-91?\u2013</small></center>\n| width2     = 70\n| header    = <center>Rank Flag</center>\n| footer    = <center><span style=\"color:white;\">'''Admiral Flote'''</span></center>\n| footer_background = #007\n}}\n\nIn Yugoslav Navy, [[Branko Mamula]] was promoted to the rank of the Admiral of the Fleet in 1983. In [[Croatian Navy]], rank of Fleet Admiral was introduced in 1995 as the naval equivalent to the [[five-star rank]] of the  [[OF-10]]. Commending him on his role as the commander of Croatian Navy during the [[Croatian War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1991-5), president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man|Tu\u0111man]] conferred the rank on admiral Letica. ''[[Sveto Letica|Sveto Letica-Barba]]'' was the first and so far the only Croatian [[flag officer]] to hold this rank.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
