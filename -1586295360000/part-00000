South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.

South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.

The album was produced by Aerosmith and [[Kevin Shirley]], and was the band's first studio album released by [[Columbia Records]] since 1982's ''[[Rock in a Hard Place]]''. It peaked at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. One of the album's singles, [[Pink (song)|\"Pink\"]], won a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].\n\n==Production==\nEarly recordings took place at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami, Florida, where the band worked with producer [[Glen Ballard]]. There, [[Steven Tyler]] and Ballard co-wrote the lyrics for \"[[Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)]]\", \"[[Taste of India]]\" and \"[[Pink (song)|Pink]]\".<ref name=billboard/> Other collaborators, including [[Desmond Child]] and [[Taylor Rhodes]], joined Tyler and guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] to write songs. Child previously collaborated with Aerosmith on such hits as \"[[Angel (Aerosmith song)|Angel]],\" \"[[Crazy (Aerosmith song)|Crazy]]\" and \"[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)|Dude (Looks like a Lady)]].\" \n\nOnly a week before rehearsals, drummer [[Joey Kramer]] was suffering from depression, having grieved the loss of his father a few years prior.<ref name=\"Kramer\">{{cite book | title = Hit Hard: A Story Of Hitting Rock Bottom At The Top | last1 = Joey Kramer| last2 = Patrick | first2 = William | authorlink2 = Keith Garde | year = 2009| publisher = HarperOne | location =  | isbn = 0061887943}} Retrieved July 10th, 2016</ref> With Kramer unavailable, rumors began to circulate that the band would disband.

He helped trim the twenty-four songs that had been written to thirteen.<ref name=billboard/> Initially, the band called the album \"Vindaloo\"<ref name=\"RecordHeaven\"/> after adding in elements of [[India]]n music throughout some of the songs, including a [[sarangi]] intro by [[Ramesh Mishra]] on the song, \"[[Taste of India]]\". But upon completing the track \"Nine Lives\", the band felt that would make the perfect title, serving as a metaphor for the album's troubled conception.\n\n==Artwork==\nThe booklet for ''Nine Lives'' contains 12 pieces of album art (including the cover).  Each picture contains a smaller version of the previous picture within itself. The final picture is included in the first, creating an infinite loop. It was designed by [[Stefan Sagmeister]].\n\nThe original cover art, inspired by a painting in a book by [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], featured Lord [[Krishna]] (with a cat's head and female breasts) dancing on the head of the [[N\u0101ga|snake demon]], [[K\u0101liy\u0101]]. The [[Hindu]] community protested, feeling the artwork was offensive. The band had been unaware of the source of the artwork, and the record company apologized, leading to the next prints removing the art from the cover and booklet.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/1424759/aerosmith-changes-cover-art-to-appease-protesters/ AEROSMITH CHANGES COVER ART TO APPEASE PROTESTERS]</ref><ref>Author unknown.

The album was produced by Aerosmith and [[Kevin Shirley]], and was the band's first studio album released by [[Columbia Records]] since 1982's ''[[Rock in a Hard Place]]''. It peaked at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. One of the album's singles, [[Pink (song)|\"Pink\"]], won a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].\n\n==Production==\nEarly recordings took place at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami, Florida, where the band worked with producer [[Glen Ballard]]. There, [[Steven Tyler]] and Ballard co-wrote the lyrics for \"[[Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)]]\", \"[[Taste of India]]\" and \"[[Pink (song)|Pink]]\".<ref name=billboard/> Other collaborators, including [[Desmond Child]] and [[Taylor Rhodes]], joined Tyler and guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] to write songs. Child previously collaborated with Aerosmith on such hits as \"[[Angel (Aerosmith song)|Angel]],\" \"[[Crazy (Aerosmith song)|Crazy]]\" and \"[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)|Dude (Looks like a Lady)]].\" \n\nOnly a week before rehearsals, drummer [[Joey Kramer]] was suffering from depression, having grieved the loss of his father a few years prior.<ref name=\"Kramer\">{{cite book | title = Hit Hard: A Story Of Hitting Rock Bottom At The Top | last1 = Joey Kramer| last2 = Patrick | first2 = William | authorlink2 = Keith Garde | year = 2009| publisher = HarperOne | location =  | isbn = 0061887943}} Retrieved July 10th, 2016</ref> With Kramer unavailable, rumors began to circulate that the band would disband.

Shirley, who had also worked with [[Journey (band)|Journey]], helped with the album's overtones and instruments, particularly the guitar sounds. In a 1997 MTV special promoting the making of ''Nine Lives'', Tyler declared: \"He's got it somewhere stuck between ''[[Toys in the Attic (album)|Toys in the Attic]]'' and ''[[Rocks (Aerosmith album)|Rocks]]''.\"<ref name=\"MTV\">MTV \u2013 Making Nine Lives.

But upon completing the track \"Nine Lives\", the band felt that would make the perfect title, serving as a metaphor for the album's troubled conception.\n\n==Artwork==\nThe booklet for ''Nine Lives'' contains 12 pieces of album art (including the cover).  Each picture contains a smaller version of the previous picture within itself. The final picture is included in the first, creating an infinite loop. It was designed by [[Stefan Sagmeister]].\n\nThe original cover art, inspired by a painting in a book by [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], featured Lord [[Krishna]] (with a cat's head and female breasts) dancing on the head of the [[N\u0101ga|snake demon]], [[K\u0101liy\u0101]]. The [[Hindu]] community protested, feeling the artwork was offensive. The band had been unaware of the source of the artwork, and the record company apologized, leading to the next prints removing the art from the cover and booklet.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/1424759/aerosmith-changes-cover-art-to-appease-protesters/ AEROSMITH CHANGES COVER ART TO APPEASE PROTESTERS]</ref><ref>Author unknown.

Hamaker''' (1914\u20131994), was an [[United States|American]] [[mechanical engineer]], [[ecologist]], [[agronomist]] and science writer in the fields of [[soil regeneration]], [[rock dust]]ing, [[mineral cycles]], [[climate cycles]] and [[glaciology]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Background===\n\nJohn Hamaker was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], [[United States]] and graduated from [[Purdue University]] in [[Mechanical Engineering]]. Concerned for the [[Natural environment|environment]], he became a student of [[ecology]] and [[agriculture]] and was influenced by books such as ''Bread From Stones'',<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Bread From Stones: A New and Rational System of Land Fertilization and Physical Regeneration'', republished by Acres USA, Austin, Texas&nbsp;\u2013 Julius Hensel</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>[http://www.carbon-negative.us/soil/bread.htm Julius Hensel by John Mann]</ref> which showed [[plants]] grow better in [[soils]] generated by mimicking natural soil-forming processes that take [[millennia]], such as the advance and retreat of [[glaciers]] scouring over the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], or rock [[weathering]] of [[volcanic]] [[lava]]. In the 1960s, Hamaker cultivated a strong interest in soil and climate issues, and began publishing articles about how the health of an individual, society and [[planet]]ary ecology only thrive as an integrated interdependent whole. For 30 years, he wrote and campaigned for [[organic agriculture]] based on soil remineralization, and was the first to call for the remineralization of the [[Earth]] to forestall the next [[glacial period]] within the current [[ice age]] cycle. Hamaker produced a notable book ''The Survival Of Civilization'' in 1982, republished in 2002<ref>\"Hamaker's book, The Survival of Civilization, published in 1982, declares that only a worldwide remineralization of the soil can stop a plunge into the worst catastrophe of recorded history. He wrote that we must stop fossil fuel use on a crash basis, grind rocks to put the minerals back into the soil to save our forests and crops, and manage the greatest social transition ever attempted. Otherwise we die.\", ''The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited'', Acres, U.S.A., Volume 16, page 28, published by Acres U.S.A., Kansas City, Missouri, 1989, digitized by Cornell University, Dec 16, 2008</ref> by Remineralize The Earth.<ref>[http://www.remineralize.org/don/synopsis01.html The Survival Of Civilization by John D Hamaker, Remineralize The Earth, 2002]</ref> [http://www.remineralize.org]\n\n===Early developments===\n\nIn the 1970s, a series of scientific conferences concluded that the world's climate is [[Global cooling|cooling]].<ref>Implications of the Climatic Controversy for Global Society, Irving Kaplan, November 1980, \"In 1972, a sizable group of climatologists meeting at Brown University issued letters to the governments of the world in which they warned of a global climatic disaster. Again in 1974, the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Study issued a similarly grave message to the community of governments from a meeting in Bonn. In 1976, a meeting of 85 climatologists chaired by Nobel Laureate Willard Libby and pioneer climatologist Cesare Emiliani put forth another warning which it had written in 1974 and which provided the same message in greater detail. The consensus of the 1979 World Climate Conference was reported by Nature as stating that the world had entered a 10,000 year cooling, that the warming theory was complex and questionable and that the loss of life and economic substance to the climate would increase.\"</ref> Books such as ''The Cooling'',<ref>The Cooling, Lowe Ponte, 1976, \"The cooling has already killed thousands of people in poor nations. If it continues and no strong measures are taken to deal with it, the cooling will cause world famine, world chaos, and probably world war, and this could all come about by the year 2000.\"</ref> ''The Weather Conspiracy'',<ref>''The Weather Conspiracy'', Peter Kilroy, Alastair Clark and The Climate Impact Team, Heron Publishing/Ballantine Books (1977). {{ISBN|0-345-27209-9}}.</ref> ''The Weather Machine & The Threat Of Ice'',<ref>''The Weather Machine & The Threat Of Ice'', Nigel Calder, BBC Publications, 1974, \"Going by past form, the warm periods between ice ages last about 10,000 years and ours has lasted 10,000 years.

H. Lamb, Routledge 1977</ref> warned of a coming ice age within decades. In 1975, Newsweek ran an article entitled \"The Cooling World\" that foretold the [[wikt:decimation|decimation]] of agricultural productivity based on a dramatic decrease in the Earth's [[temperature]].<ref>[http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/newsweek-coolingworld.pdf Newsweek, The Cooling World, 28 April 1975]</ref> and the New York Times published the article \"Scientists ask why world is changing; Major cooling may be ahead\".<ref>http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/ny-times-1975-05-21.pdf</ref> In parallel, books such as ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'',<ref>''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'', [[Edward Goldsmith]], Penguin Books, 1972</ref> ''[[The Limits To Growth]]'',<ref>''The Limits To Growth'', Donella Meadows, Club Of Rome, 1972</ref> and ''[[The Population Bomb]]'',<ref>The Population Bomb, Paul Ehrlich, Ballantine Books, 1976</ref> warned of multiple [[social]], [[economic]], [[ecological]] and [[population]] [[crises]]. At the same time, Hamaker continued to generate articles and bulletins<ref>''Factors That May Be Bringing On The Next Ice Age and How We Can Stop It'', John Hamaker, Hamaker Weaver Publishers</ref><ref>Solar Age Or Ice Age? Bulletin, John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers</ref> as well as campaign, on what was by now his main pre-occupation, the remineralization of the world's [[soils]].\n\nAccording to his writings, in 1976, Hamaker spread rock dust on part of his {{convert|10|acre|m2}} in [[Michigan]]. The following year, his [[Maize|corn]] produced 65 [[bushels]] per [[acre]], compared to [[Crop yield|yield]]s of under 25 from other local [[farms]], and also tested higher in many [[minerals]]. He calculated that remineralizing the soil with [[river]], [[Shore|seashore]], [[mountain]] and [[glacial]] rock dust, would enable [[United States|American]] agriculture to produce four times as much [[food]] or the same amount with a 25% reduction in cost, without the need for [[pesticides]] or [[chemical fertilizers]].\n\n===''The Survival Of Civilization''===\n\nIn 1982, he produced with [[California]]n [[ecologist]] Donald A. Weaver ''The Survival Of Civilization: Carbon Dioxide, Investment Money, Population&nbsp;\u2013 Three Problems Threatening Our Existence'', which was re-published by Remineralize The Earth in 2002<ref>http://www.remineralize.org/don/synopsis01.html The Survival Of Civilization: Carbon Dioxide, Investment Money, Population&nbsp;\u2013 Three Problems Threatening Our Existence; Soil, Tectonics, Climate & Economic Systems Explained-Problems and Solutions'', John Hamaker & Donald Weaver, Hamaker Weaver Publishers, 1982 / Remineralize The Earth, 2002</ref> and in 2006 by SoilandHealth.org. Annotations and supporting evidence were provided by Weaver. The book which initially sold 14,000 copies, concerned the threat of an imminent ice age, remineralizing the world's soils on a local and global scale and [[reforesting]] the [[planet]] to return [[atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] to a normal [[interglacial]] level near 280 ppm, to help slow the glacial advance.<ref>\"worldwide destruction of forests at 30 hectares per minute, plus acid rain and pollution, depleted minerals in soils&nbsp;\u2013 also causing trees and forests to die and burn, causing the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere normally balanced by forests, causing extremes in climate, cold, heat, drought, floods, storms, wind and an imminent new ice age, causing crop failure, food shortages, global famine and starvation, - is the end of civilization.\" ''The Survival Of Civilization'', John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers, 1982</ref>\n\nThe [[treatise]] was a synthesis of Hamaker's thinking that emerged from his studies and research in several disciplines including [[soil science]] and [[paleoclimatology]]. His message, dubbed the ''Hamaker Thesis'', was that due to [[intensive farming|modern]] agricultural and agro-forestry practices, the soils were running out of minerals, causing the dying and burning of [[forests]] worldwide and [[nutrient]] deficiencies in food. He offered soil remineralization as a solution, advocating regeneration of soil and forests with rock dusts as an economic and ecologically [[sustainable]] alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Hamaker regarded this as one of the most powerful ideas in [[human history]]. The book and its message was well received by soil and [[nutritional]] [[scientists]] and regarded as a [[blueprint]] for restoring the planet's ecological integrity by the worldwide remineralization movement.<ref>\"The book contained a carbon dioxide curve based on the Mauna Loa recorded concentration of carbon dioxide between 1957 and 1976, plus an anticipated extension of the curve based on soil demineralization and anticipated forest decline and burning. This curve demonstrates that more than 345 part per million of {{CO2}} will produce a glacial period if nothing is done to reduce the carbon dioxide. The destruction of our forests must be offset and a sufficient soil forest-energy program must be carried out to stop and reverse the {{CO2}} increase.\" ''The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited'', Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA, eco-agriculture newspaper, 1990s</ref>\n\n===Testimonials===\n\nEndorsing the book, [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[inventor]] of the [[geodesic dome]], author of the book ''Critical Path'' and Professor Emeritus at the University of [[Pennsylvania]], wrote in a publicized letter to Donald Weaver in 1983: \"I have received and read John Hamaker's ''The Survival of Civilization''. Well done. Completely convincing.... I will tell all those inquiring of me about matters relevant to our survival that they had best read Hamaker's book.\" <ref>''To Love & Regenerate The Earth'' (book), Don Weaver, 2002, remineralize.org</ref> Reviewing the book, writer Bertram Cohen expressed concern that a [[Abrupt climate change|global climate shift]] would make the [[temperate zone]] part of the sub-[[arctic]] zone and deprive [[World population|humanity]] of its [[food supply]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Bertram Cohen, ''Health Science Journal'', American Natural Hygiene Society, Tampa, Florida, July 1986</ref> Cohen also pointed out that \"Dr [[Herbert Shelton]], both in his books and in Hygienic Review, emphasised the importance of soil remineralization in creating a Hygienic Agriculture.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn support of the book, The Earth Renewal Society presented a statement to a [[Congressional hearing]] in [[Chicago]] in March 1984.<ref>(Palynologist) Genevi\u00e8ve Woillard has shown that the transition period to an Ice Age occurs in a 75 to 150 period with an intense 20 year changeover period at the end. John Hamaker states that we are 10 years into this changeover period. His criteria are the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: the annual rate of increase doubled from 1975 to 1985 and will double again from 1985 to 1995. Other criteria: the increase of volcanic activity and of [[earthquakes]], the shortening of the growing seasons, the increase of [[soil erosion]] - doubling in the United States from 1975 to 1981 - the increased flooding in spring, the increase of drought in the tropical areas and the drought in the temperate zones in summer, the increasing severity of winters, the increase of snow and ice masses in the polar regions, the advances of glaciers in localized areas such as [[China]] and the increase of forest fires.\" The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited, Acres USA, 1990s, page 28</ref>\n\n==Discoveries and inventions==\n\n===Rock medicine===\n\nHamaker believed remineralizing the world's soil with rock dust, a [[quarrying]] [[by-product]], could revitalise barren soil and reverse climate change. Rock dust nourished soil [[micro-organisms]] whose [[protoplasm]] is the basis of all living things. When mixed with [[compost]], the dust created rich, deep soils which could produce high growth [[vegetation]] free from [[pest (organism)|pest]]s and [[predator]]s, at an accelerated rate. The idea was later confirmed by agricultural scientists such as Arden Andersen, who showed how high [[sugar]] and [[mineral]] levels in soil gave [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to soil [[bacteria]], stopping [[insect]] and [[fungal]] attacks.<ref>''Anatomy Of Life and Energy in Agriculture'', Arden Andersen, Paperback. {{ISBN|0-911311-19-X}}. Publisher: Acres USA.</ref> For Hamaker and Andersen, minerals were the primal food for micro-organisms which provided [[life]] and [[health]] for the soil.\n\n===Rock grinders===\n\nHamaker invented an [[autogenous grinding mill|autogenous]] rock [[Mill (grinding)|grinder]], designed to grind rock upon rock with minimal wear of [[metal]] parts, and a macro version, both for creating rock dust. The full design for the rock grinder was described in ''The Survival Of Civilization'' and Donald Weaver's ''To Love And Regenerate The Earth''. On 19 October 1984, [[China]]'s Research Institute of Forests accepted a copy of Hamaker's rock grinder [[patent]] papers, since at the time, China was taking the lead in [[reforestation]] programs.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited, by Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA, 1990s</ref>\n\n==Scientific basis==\n\n===Climate cycles===\n\nThe Earth's soil is demineralized during every [[interglacial period]], the short 10,000-year [[warm period]] between every 90,000-year glacial period which is within the current Ice Age or [[Quaternary Period]] encompassing the [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]], or current [[interglacial]]. This causes a decline in the world's forests and other vegetation which are [[carbon dioxide sinks]], and so more carbon dioxide is released into the [[atmosphere]].<ref>''Stone Age Science: Rejuvenating The Earth With Rock Dust'', Dylan Keating, Permaculture, Spring 2007, \"As we reach the end of the interglacial period, the minerals have mainly left the soil.... as these minerals leave the soil, plant life decreases and carbon is released. The increased carbon acts as a signal to the planet that minerals are needed. The Earth then goes through a glacial period to replace those nutrients.\"</ref> Carbon dioxide levels in Earth's atmosphere rose throughout the 20th century and continue to do so. Excessive [[heat]] from the [[sun]] is trapped by CO<sub>2</sub> and other [[greenhouse gases]], affecting global climate. Hamaker explained the 100,000-year cycle of major ice ages by postulating that the [[greenhouse effect]] takes place mainly in the [[tropics]], which receives the most sun, instead of in [[polar region]]s.\n\n===Polar expansion===\n\nWhen temperature differences between the [[poles]] and the tropics increase, a cycle of heavy [[wind]], [[hurricanes]], [[storms]] and [[tornadoes]] occurs.<ref>''The Next Ice Age'', Larry Ephron, in The Futurist; September 01, 1989, \"The hot tropical air rises faster, and cold polar air rushes in to replace it. The result is higher winds, including more and bigger hurricanes and tornadoes. These greenhouse winds often carry much moisture with them, evaporated from the overheated tropical oceans. Carried in clouds to the higher latitudes, this moisture falls as increasing rain during the spring and fall and as increasing snow during the winter. Thus, winters get longer and colder, and there are more devastating floods in the spring.\"</ref><ref>The Next Ice Age Is on Its Way, Philip V. Brennan, Newsmax.com, Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2005 \"The {{CO2}} becomes moisture and falls as rain in the summer, autumn and spring, and snow in winter.\"</ref><ref>How Global Warming May Cause The Next Ice Age, Thom Hartmann, adapted from chapter in The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight, Three Rivers Press</ref> More [[evaporated]] [[moisture]] is carried to higher [[latitudes]] where it is deposited in [[ice]] and [[snow]], the eventual result being [[glaciation]] and another ice age.<ref>\"the global climate system seems to be more stable when the Earth has a huge volume of water locked in ice sheets in polar regions than under the present condition with ice sheets existing only on Antarctica and Greenland. It is therefore possible that the present global warming may act as the trigger of the next glaciation. If the interglacial is indeed a brief unstable period for Earth, then we should be very careful not to risk triggering the shift to the next glacial period through anthropogenic activities.\", Isamu Kayane in Interactions between the Biospheric Aspects of the Hydrological Cycle and Land Use/Cover Change, Global Change Newsletter, 25: 8-9, March 1996, quoted in Global Warming Triggers New Ice Age, Living Nutrition, Volume 4, 1997</ref> Record snow in the [[Northern hemisphere]] and the shortening of the [[growing season]] is a prevailing pattern. As glaciers [[Glacial motion|advance]] and recede during each ice age, they grind down rocks in their path.<ref>[http://www.naturallifemagazine.com/9712/organics.htm Remineralization by Jeff Johnston, Natural Life Magazine, 1997 \"These glaciers ground rock into powders as fine as flour and distributed them over wide areas.\"]</ref> The mineral-rich dust is distributed over the Earth's surface, by powerful wind and [[water]] [[systems]], remineralizing soils and enlivening plant life.\n\n===Shorter growing season===\n\nHamaker believed that within as little as a [[decade]], the growing season would decrease leading to mass [[starvation]] in [[Wealth|rich]] and [[Poverty|poor]] [[nations]] alike. He therefore proposed the remineralization of the world's soils and reforesting the land, to propagate carbon sinks, thereby absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and so contributing to general climatic stability. By assuming the task of remineralizing the Earth's soils, just like glaciers do during an ice age, remineralization would create fertile soils&nbsp;\u2013 the basis for the re-creation of stable [[ecosystems]].\n\n===Glacial threat===\n\nHamaker believed in a distinct and imminent threat of a new glacial period, following a long series of glaciations in the [[geological]] and glacial-interglacial cycle [[timeframe]].<ref>''Climatic Cycles (Hamaker)'', Australia: Nexus Magazine, 1990s, vol. 1, no. 4</ref><ref>''Climate: The Key to Understanding Business Cycles'', Raymond H. Wheeler, Tide Press (1983)</ref> He felt that remineralizing the world's soils and reforesting the land could generate a climax geosystem (as opposed to a pioneer one), through mass reforestation. This would solve the [[climate crisis]] as well as the [[food crisis]], by assisting the planet's ability to geophysiologically self-regulate, and potentially, postpone the next glaciation indefinitely.\n\n===Volcanic El Ninos===\n\nHamaker also believed that increased [[tectonic]] activity occurring with snow and ice buildup, could heat up tropical [[oceans]] through [[sea floor]] [[volcanism]], and in addition to the intensified greenhouse effect, be a prime cause of the [[El Nino]] phenomenon.\n\n==Corroborated findings==\n\nIn 1983, [[Nicholas Shackleton]] and other [[UK]] scientists published an article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' which stated that the last glacial period began when the {{CO2}} in the atmosphere reached about 290ppm, and that the world was already ahead of that figure at a critical 343-345 ppm. Hamaker explained the significance of Shackleton's findings in Acres USA:[http://www.acresusa.com] \"{{CO2}} has its primary importance as the initiator of glaciation. Once an extensive ice field is established, its cooling effect maintains the temperature differential which keeps glaciation going.

As well as [[recycling]] and returning [[organic matter]] to the soil, the organization asserted that returning all of the mineral nutrients which create fertile soils and healthy crops and forests, was equally important. For RTE, remineralization was essential to restoring [[ecological balance]] and stabilizing the climate.\n\nIn 1994, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]], National Stone Association and National Aggregates Association co-sponsored a [[symposium]]  \"Soil Remineralization and Sustainable Agriculture\" at USDA headquarters in [[Washington DC]].\n\nIn 1995, Campe coordinated a two-year research project with the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] into remineralization.\n\nIn Campe's letter to [[Newsweek]] Magazine in October 2006, she warned that [[global warming]] could trigger an ice age <ref>\u201cwe are still concerned that global warming could trigger an ice age. Remineralize the Earth advocates the remineralization of soils worldwide with finely ground rock dust as an alternative to chemical fertlilizers and pesticides and as a way to sequester carbon and stabilize the climate, whether it is ultimately warming or cooling.\u201d [[Newsweek]], October 2006</ref> and that soil remineralization and reforestation were the solutions.<ref>\"Global warming is now accelerating so quickly and so alarmingly, that if the Arctic were to totally melt, it would possibly take us out of the glacial to interglacial cycle altogether. Otherwise, warming leading to cooling is still a possibility.

Previous interglacials averaged 10 to 12,000 years in duration, with the most significant environmental change being interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession.<ref>Global Warming Triggers New Ice Age, Don Weaver, Living Nutrition Volume 4, 1997 \"We must learn from the paleo-ecological and paleo-climatological evidence of past interglacial periods and their alternation with approximately 90,000 years average glacial periods within our current ice age.\"</ref> Since this meant modern soils were relatively barren, leading to the adoption of imbalanced and artificial fertilisers, it was SEER's belief that by \"By spreading the dust, we are doing in minutes what the earth takes thousands of years to do&nbsp;\u2013 putting essential minerals in the rocks back into the earth.\" SEER won funding from the [[Scottish Executive]] to conduct the UK's first official rock dust trials, and maintained that rock dust could fight climate change because [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] in the dust converts carbon in the [[air]] into [[carbonates]], in addition to enhanced [[biosequestration]] by soil organisms and vegetation. The theory captured the attention of [[NASA]] who were researching the growing of plants on other planets.<ref>Lunar Base Agriculture: Soils For Plant Growth&nbsp;\u2013 D. Ming & D.

For Weaver and Hamaker, a new glacial period, one in a long series of glacial periods, was due in the geological and glacial-interglacial cycle timeframe. Weaver explained that Hamaker was convinced that [[human]]ity was rushing into the next glacial period due to carbon dioxide build-up after the normal interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession, as summarized by [[Johannes Iversen]] and Svend Andersen, [[Sovereign state|State]] [[Geologists]] from [[Denmark]] in the book ''The Holocene'' by Neil Roberts.<ref>Andersen, Svend, 1966, The Palaeobotanist 15:117; Andersen, Svend, 1969</ref><ref>Interglacial vegetation and soil development, Medd.

An exception was Pierre Lehman, a [[Swiss]] [[atmospheric physicist]] who noted the important link between soil and climate.<ref>\"Hamaker has at least made an attempt to put the climatic issue on a broader basis not very different from the Gaia approach of Jim Lovelock. Climate, biosphere and tectonic systems form an indissociable whole and condition each other. The biosphere and the atmosphere are interlocked in a permanent exchange of matter (carbon in particular) and energy which makes it impossible for the one not to be influenced by the other. So the soil fertility is a contributor to the climate.\" The Political Climate, in The End, Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, 1988</ref> NASA climatologist [[James Hansen]] was also noted as saying \"it is not certain whether {{CO2}} warming will cause the ice sheets to shrink or grow. For example, if the ocean warms but the air above the ice sheets remains below freezing, the effect could be increased snowfall, net ice sheet growth.\"<ref>The Political Climate, in The End, Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, 1988</ref>\n\nIn the book, [[Dave Foreman]], Founder of [[Earth First!]] wrote: \"An ice age is coming, and I welcome it as a much needed cleansing. I see no possible solution to our ruination of Earth except for a drastic reduction of the human population.\" Also quoted is S. W. Matthews, Assistant Editor, ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'': \"The ice age, which has really not left the planet for two million years, is reasserting itself. The warm time... is over. The next great return of ice has begun.\" and Paul Gersper, Professor of Soil Science, University of California: \"The actions recommended here are urgently needed to avoid global disaster.\"\n\nA film was made of the book called ''Stopping The Ice Age''<ref>Stopping The Coming Ice Age, 1988, Institute For A Future, Director: Larry Ephron</ref> in 1988, which Ephron co-produced and directed.

Ephron's writing on the ice age threat also appeared in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Weekly]]'' and Acres USA.\n\n===New Energy Movement===\n\nIn the 1980s, a contemporary of Hamaker, Alden Bryant,<ref>''Broken Planet, Broken Dreams'', Alden Bryant, Earth Regeneration Society</ref><ref>''Whose World to Lose?'', Alden Bryant, Earth Regeneration Society, 1992</ref> founded a campaign organization called Earth Regeneration Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20091221082526/http://www.earthregenerationsociety.org/] with former [[IBM]] [[engineer]] Fred Wood, Barbara Logan and others, advocating global soil remineralization, reforestation, carbon dioxide reduction and a [[Alternative energy|new energy]] movement.

Yeomans, Biosphere Media, 2007, 700 pages, {{ISBN|0-9794799-3-2}}</ref> documented in ''Priority One'', the potential to bring atmospheric carbon to pre-industrial levels within 5 years, through remineralization of the world's agricultural lands. For Yeoman, as well as reducing global {{CO2}} levels to safe levels, it would revitalize the soil and biological life on the planet, and increase human nutrition and health levels.\n\nIn 2006, British author, Graham Harvey,<ref>We Want Real Food by Graham Harvey, Constable, 2006, {{ISBN|1-84529-267-7}}</ref> produced the book ''We Want Real Food'' which documented the results of remineralization, in terms of soil health and nutritional values in food, and documented major declines in the mineral content of crops.\n\n==Rocks for Crops==\nIn 2007, the research organization Rocks for Crops<ref>''Agrogeology: The Use of Rocks for Crops'', Peter Von Straaten, Enviroquest Ltd 2007, {{ISBN|0-9680123-5-3}}</ref> [https://web.archive.org/web/20091004003108/http://www.uoguelph.ca/rocks/] was initiated by soil scientist, Jairo Restrepo Rivera of the University of [[Pelotas]], Rio Grande do Sul ([[Brazil]]), who translated ''Bread From Stones'' into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and gave conferences on remineralization in [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]]; Peter Von Straaten from the University of [[Guelph]] ([[Canada]]); and Suzi Teodoro from the University of [[Brasilia]] ([[Brazil]]).\n\nThe group confirmed that a branch of geology called '''agrogeology''', originating at the University of Guelph, was evolving, since Von Straaten published the book ''Agrogeology: The Use of Rocks for Crops'' and Rivera produced the book and [[video]], ''Manual Pr\u00e1ctico ABC de la Agricultura Org\u00e1nica y Harina de Rocas'',<ref>''Manual Pr\u00e1ctico ABC de la Agricultura Org\u00e1nica y Harina de Rocas'', Jairo Restrepo Rivera, Ventas Publicaciones/COAS, Mexico</ref> which described how to regenerate overcultivated soils with rock dust. The science was developing in Germany, [[Canada]] and USA, and being researched in Brazil, [[Tanzania]] and the [[Canary Islands]]. Other university researchers included professors William Fyfe and Ward Chesworth.\n\nThe science of agrogeology is the study of natural geological materials suitable for restoring soils as an alternative to chemical fertilizers, particularly for worn out tropical soils. Due to intense tropical [[rainfall]], chemical fertilizers are washed away from [[laterite]] soils within weeks, and cannot be stored by the soils, are thus especially harmful to the [[groundwater]]. Rock fertilizers supply nutrients over longer periods to cultivated plants. When the rocks break down, new minerals are made available to the soil micro-organisms and whole soil-food web. From the soil chemist's perspective, the process improves the [[ion-exchange]] capacity of soils while forming new clay minerals.<ref>\"The total ionic charge that can be held in a soil. The number of positively or negatively charged sites in a soil body.\", ''Cation Exchange Capacity'', http://www.tereco.sr.unh.edu/definitions.html</ref>\n\nIn November 2009, a Rocks for Crops conference was held in Brasilia with 170 participants to discuss the new [[science]].

His proposal, [[rock dust]]ing, known to enhance plant growth by nourishing biological and chemical aspects of the rhizosphere, resulted in [[soil regeneration]] to boost global plant cover. This assisted Earth's self-regulation and offered a more natural [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] solution to the climate crisis not dependent on [[high technology]], or on-going climate manipulation by man.<ref>The Royal Society's Report on Geoengineering the Climate: Geoengineering or Geopiracy?, Sep 4 2009, ETC Group, Canada, etcgroup.org</ref> Some scientists have postulated that [[technological]] solutions may exist to assist the remineralization process, such as converting carbon dioxide into [[organic carbon]] to be mineralized as [[sediment]] before being weathered to soil.\n\n==Writings==\nHamaker's main book was ''The Survival Of Civilization'' (1983, 2002).<ref>[http://www.remineralize.org/don/synopsis01.html ''The Survival Of Civilization'', John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers, 1983, Remineralize The Earth 2002]</ref> He also produced various articles and publications from the 1960s to the 1990s.

Weaver remains involved in education campaigns to alert humanity to the climate crisis and foundational rock dust solution.\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n===Energy===\n\nHamaker's hypothesis is criticised because [[fossil fuel]] energy is potentially required to create and distribute rock dust, and this generates {{CO2}} when derived from fossil fuel, however, rock dust is predominantly a byproduct of the existing aggregate and quarrying industries <ref>[http://www.championtrees.org/topsoil/PitnQuarry.htm Soil remineralization: a future market for aggregate industry fines, Robert J. Able, June 1995, ''Pit & Quarry'']</ref> Future rock dust production for broad-scale soil remineralization can be powered by renewable sources, such as wind energy and bio-fuels grown on remineralized soils.\n\n===Climate control===\n\nSince land is naturally fertilized in glacial periods, remineralizing the Earth would emulate the glaciation process, allowing the reversal of what Hamaker and Weaver referred to as the ''interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession'' (decline in the [[NDVI|vegetative index]]).<ref>''The Survival of Civilization'', John Hamaker, Hamaker Weaver Publishers, 198</ref> They reasoned that this would indefinitely sustain the interglacial ecosystem and climate, or at least slow down the speed of re-glaciation.

He believed the coming glacial period would preceded by an interglacial-to-glacial transition phase already underway since the 1970s, and strongly advocated an intensive global co-operative soil remineralization effort to maintain the quantity of food while improving its quality. To achieve this, he recommended simultaneous remineralization of dying forests and soils, also needed to grow bio-fuels, as part of a goal to return excessive carbon dioxide to stable interglacial levels of 280 ppm.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Immobilization (soil science)]]\n*[[Mineralization (soil)]]\n*[[Noctilucent clouds]]\n*[[Remineralisation]]\n*[[Rockdust]]\n*[[Rock flour]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.renew-the-earth.org Renew The Earth]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hamaker, John}}\n[[Category:Sustainability advocates]]\n[[Category:Independent scientists]]\n[[Category:Non-fiction environmental writers]]\n[[Category:1914 births]]\n[[Category:1994 deaths]]\n[[Category:Geoengineers]]\n[[Category:American ecologists]]\n[[Category:American agronomists]]\n[[Category:American mechanical engineers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American engineers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Mechanical engineer, ecologist, agronomist (1914\u20131994)}}\n'''John D.

Concerned for the [[Natural environment|environment]], he became a student of [[ecology]] and [[agriculture]] and was influenced by books such as ''Bread From Stones'',<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Bread From Stones: A New and Rational System of Land Fertilization and Physical Regeneration'', republished by Acres USA, Austin, Texas&nbsp;\u2013 Julius Hensel</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>[http://www.carbon-negative.us/soil/bread.htm Julius Hensel by John Mann]</ref> which showed [[plants]] grow better in [[soils]] generated by mimicking natural soil-forming processes that take [[millennia]], such as the advance and retreat of [[glaciers]] scouring over the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], or rock [[weathering]] of [[volcanic]] [[lava]]. In the 1960s, Hamaker cultivated a strong interest in soil and climate issues, and began publishing articles about how the health of an individual, society and [[planet]]ary ecology only thrive as an integrated interdependent whole. For 30 years, he wrote and campaigned for [[organic agriculture]] based on soil remineralization, and was the first to call for the remineralization of the [[Earth]] to forestall the next [[glacial period]] within the current [[ice age]] cycle. Hamaker produced a notable book ''The Survival Of Civilization'' in 1982, republished in 2002<ref>\"Hamaker's book, The Survival of Civilization, published in 1982, declares that only a worldwide remineralization of the soil can stop a plunge into the worst catastrophe of recorded history.

Again in 1974, the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Study issued a similarly grave message to the community of governments from a meeting in Bonn. In 1976, a meeting of 85 climatologists chaired by Nobel Laureate Willard Libby and pioneer climatologist Cesare Emiliani put forth another warning which it had written in 1974 and which provided the same message in greater detail. The consensus of the 1979 World Climate Conference was reported by Nature as stating that the world had entered a 10,000 year cooling, that the warming theory was complex and questionable and that the loss of life and economic substance to the climate would increase.\"</ref> Books such as ''The Cooling'',<ref>The Cooling, Lowe Ponte, 1976, \"The cooling has already killed thousands of people in poor nations.

H. Lamb, Routledge 1977</ref> warned of a coming ice age within decades. In 1975, Newsweek ran an article entitled \"The Cooling World\" that foretold the [[wikt:decimation|decimation]] of agricultural productivity based on a dramatic decrease in the Earth's [[temperature]].<ref>[http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/newsweek-coolingworld.pdf Newsweek, The Cooling World, 28 April 1975]</ref> and the New York Times published the article \"Scientists ask why world is changing; Major cooling may be ahead\".<ref>http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/ny-times-1975-05-21.pdf</ref> In parallel, books such as ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'',<ref>''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'', [[Edward Goldsmith]], Penguin Books, 1972</ref> ''[[The Limits To Growth]]'',<ref>''The Limits To Growth'', Donella Meadows, Club Of Rome, 1972</ref> and ''[[The Population Bomb]]'',<ref>The Population Bomb, Paul Ehrlich, Ballantine Books, 1976</ref> warned of multiple [[social]], [[economic]], [[ecological]] and [[population]] [[crises]]. At the same time, Hamaker continued to generate articles and bulletins<ref>''Factors That May Be Bringing On The Next Ice Age and How We Can Stop It'', John Hamaker, Hamaker Weaver Publishers</ref><ref>Solar Age Or Ice Age? Bulletin, John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers</ref> as well as campaign, on what was by now his main pre-occupation, the remineralization of the world's [[soils]].\n\nAccording to his writings, in 1976, Hamaker spread rock dust on part of his {{convert|10|acre|m2}} in [[Michigan]]. The following year, his [[Maize|corn]] produced 65 [[bushels]] per [[acre]], compared to [[Crop yield|yield]]s of under 25 from other local [[farms]], and also tested higher in many [[minerals]]. He calculated that remineralizing the soil with [[river]], [[Shore|seashore]], [[mountain]] and [[glacial]] rock dust, would enable [[United States|American]] agriculture to produce four times as much [[food]] or the same amount with a 25% reduction in cost, without the need for [[pesticides]] or [[chemical fertilizers]].\n\n===''The Survival Of Civilization''===\n\nIn 1982, he produced with [[California]]n [[ecologist]] Donald A. Weaver ''The Survival Of Civilization: Carbon Dioxide, Investment Money, Population&nbsp;\u2013 Three Problems Threatening Our Existence'', which was re-published by Remineralize The Earth in 2002<ref>http://www.remineralize.org/don/synopsis01.html The Survival Of Civilization: Carbon Dioxide, Investment Money, Population&nbsp;\u2013 Three Problems Threatening Our Existence; Soil, Tectonics, Climate & Economic Systems Explained-Problems and Solutions'', John Hamaker & Donald Weaver, Hamaker Weaver Publishers, 1982 / Remineralize The Earth, 2002</ref> and in 2006 by SoilandHealth.org. Annotations and supporting evidence were provided by Weaver. The book which initially sold 14,000 copies, concerned the threat of an imminent ice age, remineralizing the world's soils on a local and global scale and [[reforesting]] the [[planet]] to return [[atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] to a normal [[interglacial]] level near 280 ppm, to help slow the glacial advance.<ref>\"worldwide destruction of forests at 30 hectares per minute, plus acid rain and pollution, depleted minerals in soils&nbsp;\u2013 also causing trees and forests to die and burn, causing the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere normally balanced by forests, causing extremes in climate, cold, heat, drought, floods, storms, wind and an imminent new ice age, causing crop failure, food shortages, global famine and starvation, - is the end of civilization.\" ''The Survival Of Civilization'', John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers, 1982</ref>\n\nThe [[treatise]] was a synthesis of Hamaker's thinking that emerged from his studies and research in several disciplines including [[soil science]] and [[paleoclimatology]]. His message, dubbed the ''Hamaker Thesis'', was that due to [[intensive farming|modern]] agricultural and agro-forestry practices, the soils were running out of minerals, causing the dying and burning of [[forests]] worldwide and [[nutrient]] deficiencies in food. He offered soil remineralization as a solution, advocating regeneration of soil and forests with rock dusts as an economic and ecologically [[sustainable]] alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Hamaker regarded this as one of the most powerful ideas in [[human history]]. The book and its message was well received by soil and [[nutritional]] [[scientists]] and regarded as a [[blueprint]] for restoring the planet's ecological integrity by the worldwide remineralization movement.<ref>\"The book contained a carbon dioxide curve based on the Mauna Loa recorded concentration of carbon dioxide between 1957 and 1976, plus an anticipated extension of the curve based on soil demineralization and anticipated forest decline and burning. This curve demonstrates that more than 345 part per million of {{CO2}} will produce a glacial period if nothing is done to reduce the carbon dioxide. The destruction of our forests must be offset and a sufficient soil forest-energy program must be carried out to stop and reverse the {{CO2}} increase.\" ''The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited'', Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA, eco-agriculture newspaper, 1990s</ref>\n\n===Testimonials===\n\nEndorsing the book, [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[inventor]] of the [[geodesic dome]], author of the book ''Critical Path'' and Professor Emeritus at the University of [[Pennsylvania]], wrote in a publicized letter to Donald Weaver in 1983: \"I have received and read John Hamaker's ''The Survival of Civilization''. Well done. Completely convincing.... I will tell all those inquiring of me about matters relevant to our survival that they had best read Hamaker's book.\" <ref>''To Love & Regenerate The Earth'' (book), Don Weaver, 2002, remineralize.org</ref> Reviewing the book, writer Bertram Cohen expressed concern that a [[Abrupt climate change|global climate shift]] would make the [[temperate zone]] part of the sub-[[arctic]] zone and deprive [[World population|humanity]] of its [[food supply]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Bertram Cohen, ''Health Science Journal'', American Natural Hygiene Society, Tampa, Florida, July 1986</ref> Cohen also pointed out that \"Dr [[Herbert Shelton]], both in his books and in Hygienic Review, emphasised the importance of soil remineralization in creating a Hygienic Agriculture.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn support of the book, The Earth Renewal Society presented a statement to a [[Congressional hearing]] in [[Chicago]] in March 1984.<ref>(Palynologist) Genevi\u00e8ve Woillard has shown that the transition period to an Ice Age occurs in a 75 to 150 period with an intense 20 year changeover period at the end. John Hamaker states that we are 10 years into this changeover period. His criteria are the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: the annual rate of increase doubled from 1975 to 1985 and will double again from 1985 to 1995. Other criteria: the increase of volcanic activity and of [[earthquakes]], the shortening of the growing seasons, the increase of [[soil erosion]] - doubling in the United States from 1975 to 1981 - the increased flooding in spring, the increase of drought in the tropical areas and the drought in the temperate zones in summer, the increasing severity of winters, the increase of snow and ice masses in the polar regions, the advances of glaciers in localized areas such as [[China]] and the increase of forest fires.\" The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited, Acres USA, 1990s, page 28</ref>\n\n==Discoveries and inventions==\n\n===Rock medicine===\n\nHamaker believed remineralizing the world's soil with rock dust, a [[quarrying]] [[by-product]], could revitalise barren soil and reverse climate change. Rock dust nourished soil [[micro-organisms]] whose [[protoplasm]] is the basis of all living things. When mixed with [[compost]], the dust created rich, deep soils which could produce high growth [[vegetation]] free from [[pest (organism)|pest]]s and [[predator]]s, at an accelerated rate. The idea was later confirmed by agricultural scientists such as Arden Andersen, who showed how high [[sugar]] and [[mineral]] levels in soil gave [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to soil [[bacteria]], stopping [[insect]] and [[fungal]] attacks.<ref>''Anatomy Of Life and Energy in Agriculture'', Arden Andersen, Paperback. {{ISBN|0-911311-19-X}}. Publisher: Acres USA.</ref> For Hamaker and Andersen, minerals were the primal food for micro-organisms which provided [[life]] and [[health]] for the soil.\n\n===Rock grinders===\n\nHamaker invented an [[autogenous grinding mill|autogenous]] rock [[Mill (grinding)|grinder]], designed to grind rock upon rock with minimal wear of [[metal]] parts, and a macro version, both for creating rock dust. The full design for the rock grinder was described in ''The Survival Of Civilization'' and Donald Weaver's ''To Love And Regenerate The Earth''. On 19 October 1984, [[China]]'s Research Institute of Forests accepted a copy of Hamaker's rock grinder [[patent]] papers, since at the time, China was taking the lead in [[reforestation]] programs.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited, by Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA, 1990s</ref>\n\n==Scientific basis==\n\n===Climate cycles===\n\nThe Earth's soil is demineralized during every [[interglacial period]], the short 10,000-year [[warm period]] between every 90,000-year glacial period which is within the current Ice Age or [[Quaternary Period]] encompassing the [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]], or current [[interglacial]]. This causes a decline in the world's forests and other vegetation which are [[carbon dioxide sinks]], and so more carbon dioxide is released into the [[atmosphere]].<ref>''Stone Age Science: Rejuvenating The Earth With Rock Dust'', Dylan Keating, Permaculture, Spring 2007, \"As we reach the end of the interglacial period, the minerals have mainly left the soil.... as these minerals leave the soil, plant life decreases and carbon is released. The increased carbon acts as a signal to the planet that minerals are needed. The Earth then goes through a glacial period to replace those nutrients.\"</ref> Carbon dioxide levels in Earth's atmosphere rose throughout the 20th century and continue to do so. Excessive [[heat]] from the [[sun]] is trapped by CO<sub>2</sub> and other [[greenhouse gases]], affecting global climate. Hamaker explained the 100,000-year cycle of major ice ages by postulating that the [[greenhouse effect]] takes place mainly in the [[tropics]], which receives the most sun, instead of in [[polar region]]s.\n\n===Polar expansion===\n\nWhen temperature differences between the [[poles]] and the tropics increase, a cycle of heavy [[wind]], [[hurricanes]], [[storms]] and [[tornadoes]] occurs.<ref>''The Next Ice Age'', Larry Ephron, in The Futurist; September 01, 1989, \"The hot tropical air rises faster, and cold polar air rushes in to replace it. The result is higher winds, including more and bigger hurricanes and tornadoes. These greenhouse winds often carry much moisture with them, evaporated from the overheated tropical oceans. Carried in clouds to the higher latitudes, this moisture falls as increasing rain during the spring and fall and as increasing snow during the winter. Thus, winters get longer and colder, and there are more devastating floods in the spring.\"</ref><ref>The Next Ice Age Is on Its Way, Philip V. Brennan, Newsmax.com, Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2005 \"The {{CO2}} becomes moisture and falls as rain in the summer, autumn and spring, and snow in winter.\"</ref><ref>How Global Warming May Cause The Next Ice Age, Thom Hartmann, adapted from chapter in The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight, Three Rivers Press</ref> More [[evaporated]] [[moisture]] is carried to higher [[latitudes]] where it is deposited in [[ice]] and [[snow]], the eventual result being [[glaciation]] and another ice age.<ref>\"the global climate system seems to be more stable when the Earth has a huge volume of water locked in ice sheets in polar regions than under the present condition with ice sheets existing only on Antarctica and Greenland. It is therefore possible that the present global warming may act as the trigger of the next glaciation. If the interglacial is indeed a brief unstable period for Earth, then we should be very careful not to risk triggering the shift to the next glacial period through anthropogenic activities.\", Isamu Kayane in Interactions between the Biospheric Aspects of the Hydrological Cycle and Land Use/Cover Change, Global Change Newsletter, 25: 8-9, March 1996, quoted in Global Warming Triggers New Ice Age, Living Nutrition, Volume 4, 1997</ref> Record snow in the [[Northern hemisphere]] and the shortening of the [[growing season]] is a prevailing pattern. As glaciers [[Glacial motion|advance]] and recede during each ice age, they grind down rocks in their path.<ref>[http://www.naturallifemagazine.com/9712/organics.htm Remineralization by Jeff Johnston, Natural Life Magazine, 1997 \"These glaciers ground rock into powders as fine as flour and distributed them over wide areas.\"]</ref> The mineral-rich dust is distributed over the Earth's surface, by powerful wind and [[water]] [[systems]], remineralizing soils and enlivening plant life.\n\n===Shorter growing season===\n\nHamaker believed that within as little as a [[decade]], the growing season would decrease leading to mass [[starvation]] in [[Wealth|rich]] and [[Poverty|poor]] [[nations]] alike. He therefore proposed the remineralization of the world's soils and reforesting the land, to propagate carbon sinks, thereby absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and so contributing to general climatic stability. By assuming the task of remineralizing the Earth's soils, just like glaciers do during an ice age, remineralization would create fertile soils&nbsp;\u2013 the basis for the re-creation of stable [[ecosystems]].\n\n===Glacial threat===\n\nHamaker believed in a distinct and imminent threat of a new glacial period, following a long series of glaciations in the [[geological]] and glacial-interglacial cycle [[timeframe]].<ref>''Climatic Cycles (Hamaker)'', Australia: Nexus Magazine, 1990s, vol. 1, no. 4</ref><ref>''Climate: The Key to Understanding Business Cycles'', Raymond H. Wheeler, Tide Press (1983)</ref> He felt that remineralizing the world's soils and reforesting the land could generate a climax geosystem (as opposed to a pioneer one), through mass reforestation. This would solve the [[climate crisis]] as well as the [[food crisis]], by assisting the planet's ability to geophysiologically self-regulate, and potentially, postpone the next glaciation indefinitely.\n\n===Volcanic El Ninos===\n\nHamaker also believed that increased [[tectonic]] activity occurring with snow and ice buildup, could heat up tropical [[oceans]] through [[sea floor]] [[volcanism]], and in addition to the intensified greenhouse effect, be a prime cause of the [[El Nino]] phenomenon.\n\n==Corroborated findings==\n\nIn 1983, [[Nicholas Shackleton]] and other [[UK]] scientists published an article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' which stated that the last glacial period began when the {{CO2}} in the atmosphere reached about 290ppm, and that the world was already ahead of that figure at a critical 343-345 ppm. Hamaker explained the significance of Shackleton's findings in Acres USA:[http://www.acresusa.com] \"{{CO2}} has its primary importance as the initiator of glaciation. Once an extensive ice field is established, its cooling effect maintains the temperature differential which keeps glaciation going. Variations in the amount of {{CO2}} simply cause variations in the world albedo, but they do not stop or start glaciation. The world is committed to glaciation when the ice fields alone reflect enough sunlight to ensure cooling.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nOn 3 June 1984, Hamaker appeared on [[Ted Turner]]'s [[Atlanta]] [[Superstation]] declaring that increased high-latitude [[albedo]] is what initiates glacial advances/retreats. He was citing [[George Simpson (meteorologist)|Sir George Simpson]]'s 1938 analysis on ice ages<ref>Simpson, Sir George, Ice Ages, Nature 141: 591, 1938, reprinted in the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution 1938, 289-302.</ref> and later commentary by [[Richard Somerville]] and Lorraine Remer of the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in their article in the Journal of Geophysical Research: \"It's that cloud that you have to worry about because it's reflecting 80% of the sun's energy back into space and it's never becoming effective in warming the Earth. So we're getting cooling as the result of the carbon dioxide buildup.\" <ref>''The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited'', by Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA (newspaper), 1990s</ref> Around this time, [[Scientific American]] summarized: \"They (Somerville & Remer) suggest the global warming might be lessened by concurrent changes in the properties of clouds... Denser clouds will reflect a larger proportion of incoming solar radiation; the reduction in the energy reaching the surface will counteract the greenhouse effect.\" <ref>Scientific American article quoted in ''The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited'', by Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA, 1990s</ref>\n\nAlso in 1984, Robert Beckman produced ''The Downwave'' citing the studies of Dr. [[Raymond Wheeler]] and its climate-societal implications.<ref>The Downwave, Robert Beckman, 1984, \"Dr Raymond Wheeler of the University of Kansas invested 20 years and a staff of over 200 to compile detailed charts covering 3,000 years of world weather, correlated with the exact dates of significant events in recorded history. According to Wheeler, the world should now be preparing for long shortages in water supplies and for shorter, not longer, growing seasons.

Hamaker's work inspired a growing [[Social movement|movement]] of [[people]] to become involved in remineralization, including [[permaculture|permaculturists]], organic [[farmers]], [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic]] farmers, [[gardeners]], [[vegetarians]], [[environmentalists]], scientists, [[climatologists]], [[journalists]], [[Religious denomination|religious groups]], [[political groups]], [[community organizations]] and ordinary [[citizens]].\n\n===''Remineralize The Earth''===\n\nIn the 1980s, Hamaker became a [[catalyst]] for the formation of Remineralize The Earth (RTE), set up by Joanna Campe, its President and Executive Director who produced the Soil Remineralization Newsletter in the 1980s and Remineralize the Earth magazine in the 1990s, before the [[non-profit]] organization's [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] in 1994.\n\nRTE began promoting the regeneration of soils and forests worldwide with finely ground rock dust as a sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. As well as [[recycling]] and returning [[organic matter]] to the soil, the organization asserted that returning all of the mineral nutrients which create fertile soils and healthy crops and forests, was equally important. For RTE, remineralization was essential to restoring [[ecological balance]] and stabilizing the climate.\n\nIn 1994, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]], National Stone Association and National Aggregates Association co-sponsored a [[symposium]]  \"Soil Remineralization and Sustainable Agriculture\" at USDA headquarters in [[Washington DC]].\n\nIn 1995, Campe coordinated a two-year research project with the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] into remineralization.\n\nIn Campe's letter to [[Newsweek]] Magazine in October 2006, she warned that [[global warming]] could trigger an ice age <ref>\u201cwe are still concerned that global warming could trigger an ice age. Remineralize the Earth advocates the remineralization of soils worldwide with finely ground rock dust as an alternative to chemical fertlilizers and pesticides and as a way to sequester carbon and stabilize the climate, whether it is ultimately warming or cooling.\u201d [[Newsweek]], October 2006</ref> and that soil remineralization and reforestation were the solutions.<ref>\"Global warming is now accelerating so quickly and so alarmingly, that if the Arctic were to totally melt, it would possibly take us out of the glacial to interglacial cycle altogether. Otherwise, warming leading to cooling is still a possibility. Remineralization of soils is not only key to stabilizing the climate, but in this era of great concern about peak oil, could create an [[post-scarcity economy|economics of abundance]] rather than scarcity (fertilizing soils with petrochemicals). Millions of tons of mineral fines are stored as a by-product of the aggregate industry and could be the basis for a new sustainable agriculture and forestry.\" [[Newsweek]], October 2006</ref> In the same period, major [[magazines]] expressed concern of a coming ice age including The [[Atlantic Monthly]],<ref>The Great Climate Flip-Flop, William Calvin, Atlantic Monthly, January 1998.</ref> ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'',<ref>''Sea Study Warns Mini Ice Age May Be Coming Soon'', James Owen, National Geographic News, November 2005.</ref> [[Discover Magazine]],<ref>Discover, \"Global Warming Surprise: A New Ice Age\", \"Oceanographers have discovered a huge river of freshwater in the Atlantic formed by melting polar ice.

Previous interglacials averaged 10 to 12,000 years in duration, with the most significant environmental change being interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession.<ref>Global Warming Triggers New Ice Age, Don Weaver, Living Nutrition Volume 4, 1997 \"We must learn from the paleo-ecological and paleo-climatological evidence of past interglacial periods and their alternation with approximately 90,000 years average glacial periods within our current ice age.\"</ref> Since this meant modern soils were relatively barren, leading to the adoption of imbalanced and artificial fertilisers, it was SEER's belief that by \"By spreading the dust, we are doing in minutes what the earth takes thousands of years to do&nbsp;\u2013 putting essential minerals in the rocks back into the earth.\" SEER won funding from the [[Scottish Executive]] to conduct the UK's first official rock dust trials, and maintained that rock dust could fight climate change because [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] in the dust converts carbon in the [[air]] into [[carbonates]], in addition to enhanced [[biosequestration]] by soil organisms and vegetation. The theory captured the attention of [[NASA]] who were researching the growing of plants on other planets.<ref>Lunar Base Agriculture: Soils For Plant Growth&nbsp;\u2013 D. Ming & D. Henninger, American Society of Agronomy (1989), {{ISBN|0-89118-100-8}}.</ref>\n\nFor SEER, as well as producing high yields, and re-balancing the Earth's ecology and [[geophysiology]], rock dusting also brought nutritional benefits due to the enrichment of crops, and so benefits to human health.<ref>[http://www.gardening-guy.com/stories/storyReader$37 On a Fad Diet of Rock Dust, How the Garden Does Grow Henry Homeyer, June 24, 2004, ''New York Times''.]</ref>\n\nBut the SEER centre has been frustrated in their hopes to provide [[scientific proof]] of their claims for higher yields and enriched crops, through the use of rock dust.

For Weaver and Hamaker, a new glacial period, one in a long series of glacial periods, was due in the geological and glacial-interglacial cycle timeframe. Weaver explained that Hamaker was convinced that [[human]]ity was rushing into the next glacial period due to carbon dioxide build-up after the normal interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession, as summarized by [[Johannes Iversen]] and Svend Andersen, [[Sovereign state|State]] [[Geologists]] from [[Denmark]] in the book ''The Holocene'' by Neil Roberts.<ref>Andersen, Svend, 1966, The Palaeobotanist 15:117; Andersen, Svend, 1969</ref><ref>Interglacial vegetation and soil development, Medd.

If not, we may stop eating.\" ''The End'' by Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, California, 1988, {{ISBN|0-89087-507-3}}</ref> Topics covered included [[astrophysics]], climatology, geology, glaciology, [[microbiology]], [[paleobotany]], [[paleontology]], [[palynology]], [[plate tectonics]], soil remineralization, [[seismology]], soil science, [[solar physics]] and human survival.\n\nEphron showed how climatologists such as [[John Gribbin]] and [[Stephen Schneider]] who recognized the connection between global warming and the buildup of snow and ice, saw ice buildup only as a side effect of continued overall warming, rather than linking {{CO2}} increase, global warming, ice buildup, glaciation and [[ice ages]], together. An exception was Pierre Lehman, a [[Swiss]] [[atmospheric physicist]] who noted the important link between soil and climate.<ref>\"Hamaker has at least made an attempt to put the climatic issue on a broader basis not very different from the Gaia approach of Jim Lovelock. Climate, biosphere and tectonic systems form an indissociable whole and condition each other. The biosphere and the atmosphere are interlocked in a permanent exchange of matter (carbon in particular) and energy which makes it impossible for the one not to be influenced by the other. So the soil fertility is a contributor to the climate.\" The Political Climate, in The End, Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, 1988</ref> NASA climatologist [[James Hansen]] was also noted as saying \"it is not certain whether {{CO2}} warming will cause the ice sheets to shrink or grow. For example, if the ocean warms but the air above the ice sheets remains below freezing, the effect could be increased snowfall, net ice sheet growth.\"<ref>The Political Climate, in The End, Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, 1988</ref>\n\nIn the book, [[Dave Foreman]], Founder of [[Earth First!]] wrote: \"An ice age is coming, and I welcome it as a much needed cleansing. I see no possible solution to our ruination of Earth except for a drastic reduction of the human population.\" Also quoted is S. W. Matthews, Assistant Editor, ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'': \"The ice age, which has really not left the planet for two million years, is reasserting itself. The warm time... is over. The next great return of ice has begun.\" and Paul Gersper, Professor of Soil Science, University of California: \"The actions recommended here are urgently needed to avoid global disaster.\"\n\nA film was made of the book called ''Stopping The Ice Age''<ref>Stopping The Coming Ice Age, 1988, Institute For A Future, Director: Larry Ephron</ref> in 1988, which Ephron co-produced and directed. Like the book, it carried endorsements from various scientists and [[universities]] including Kenneth Watt, Professor of [[Environmental Studies]], [[University of California]]: \"An astonishing service for humanity\" and [[recording artist]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]: \"Everybody has to see this\". Ephron's writing on the ice age threat also appeared in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Weekly]]'' and Acres USA.\n\n===New Energy Movement===\n\nIn the 1980s, a contemporary of Hamaker, Alden Bryant,<ref>''Broken Planet, Broken Dreams'', Alden Bryant, Earth Regeneration Society</ref><ref>''Whose World to Lose?'', Alden Bryant, Earth Regeneration Society, 1992</ref> founded a campaign organization called Earth Regeneration Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20091221082526/http://www.earthregenerationsociety.org/] with former [[IBM]] [[engineer]] Fred Wood, Barbara Logan and others, advocating global soil remineralization, reforestation, carbon dioxide reduction and a [[Alternative energy|new energy]] movement. After attending many international conferences on climate issues, Bryant set up the New Energy Movement organization.[http://www.newenergymovement.org]\n\n==Further proponents==\nSeveral books citing remineralization have been published including ''The Tree War: How to Save the Earth and Bring Together the Nations'',<ref>''The Tree War: How to save the earth and bring together the nations'', Barry Lynes, Mass: Springfield, 1983</ref> ''The Enlivened Rock Powders'',<ref>The Enlivened Powders, Harvey Lisle, Acres USA, 1994</ref> ''The Secrets of the Soil'',<ref>''The Secrets of the Soil: New Solutions for Restoring Our Planet'', Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird (Arkana,  1992), {{ISBN|0-14-019311-1}}</ref> ''Empty Harvest''<ref>Empty Harvest: understanding the link Between Our Food, Our Immunity, and Our Planet, Dr. Bernard Jensen & Mark Anderson, 1989</ref> and ''The Secret Life Of Plants''.<ref>''The Secret Life of Plants'', Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, HarperPerennial 1989, {{ISBN|0-06-091587-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, [[Peter von Fragstein]] of the [[University of Kassel]], Germany, began researching remineralization with many different rock types as a slow-release [[fertilizer]] and to deter insects.\n\nHamaker's research also complemented work by [[Bill Mollison]]<ref>Permaculture: A Designers' Manual: A Designer's Manual by Bill Mollison and Andrew Jeeves, Tagari Publications, 1998</ref> on permaculture, John Jeavons<ref>How to Grow More Vegetables: And Fruits, Nuts, Berries, Grains, and Other Crops Than You Can Imagine, John Jeavons, Ten Speed Press; 7th Revised edition (30 Nov 2006), {{ISBN|1-58008-796-5}}</ref> and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] on sustainable organiculture, [[Emilia Hazelip]] on synergistic agriculture and [[Rudolf Steiner]] on biodynamic farming.

Yeomans, Biosphere Media, 2007, 700 pages, {{ISBN|0-9794799-3-2}}</ref> documented in ''Priority One'', the potential to bring atmospheric carbon to pre-industrial levels within 5 years, through remineralization of the world's agricultural lands. For Yeoman, as well as reducing global {{CO2}} levels to safe levels, it would revitalize the soil and biological life on the planet, and increase human nutrition and health levels.\n\nIn 2006, British author, Graham Harvey,<ref>We Want Real Food by Graham Harvey, Constable, 2006, {{ISBN|1-84529-267-7}}</ref> produced the book ''We Want Real Food'' which documented the results of remineralization, in terms of soil health and nutritional values in food, and documented major declines in the mineral content of crops.\n\n==Rocks for Crops==\nIn 2007, the research organization Rocks for Crops<ref>''Agrogeology: The Use of Rocks for Crops'', Peter Von Straaten, Enviroquest Ltd 2007, {{ISBN|0-9680123-5-3}}</ref> [https://web.archive.org/web/20091004003108/http://www.uoguelph.ca/rocks/] was initiated by soil scientist, Jairo Restrepo Rivera of the University of [[Pelotas]], Rio Grande do Sul ([[Brazil]]), who translated ''Bread From Stones'' into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and gave conferences on remineralization in [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]]; Peter Von Straaten from the University of [[Guelph]] ([[Canada]]); and Suzi Teodoro from the University of [[Brasilia]] ([[Brazil]]).\n\nThe group confirmed that a branch of geology called '''agrogeology''', originating at the University of Guelph, was evolving, since Von Straaten published the book ''Agrogeology: The Use of Rocks for Crops'' and Rivera produced the book and [[video]], ''Manual Pr\u00e1ctico ABC de la Agricultura Org\u00e1nica y Harina de Rocas'',<ref>''Manual Pr\u00e1ctico ABC de la Agricultura Org\u00e1nica y Harina de Rocas'', Jairo Restrepo Rivera, Ventas Publicaciones/COAS, Mexico</ref> which described how to regenerate overcultivated soils with rock dust. The science was developing in Germany, [[Canada]] and USA, and being researched in Brazil, [[Tanzania]] and the [[Canary Islands]]. Other university researchers included professors William Fyfe and Ward Chesworth.\n\nThe science of agrogeology is the study of natural geological materials suitable for restoring soils as an alternative to chemical fertilizers, particularly for worn out tropical soils. Due to intense tropical [[rainfall]], chemical fertilizers are washed away from [[laterite]] soils within weeks, and cannot be stored by the soils, are thus especially harmful to the [[groundwater]]. Rock fertilizers supply nutrients over longer periods to cultivated plants. When the rocks break down, new minerals are made available to the soil micro-organisms and whole soil-food web. From the soil chemist's perspective, the process improves the [[ion-exchange]] capacity of soils while forming new clay minerals.<ref>\"The total ionic charge that can be held in a soil. The number of positively or negatively charged sites in a soil body.\", ''Cation Exchange Capacity'', http://www.tereco.sr.unh.edu/definitions.html</ref>\n\nIn November 2009, a Rocks for Crops conference was held in Brasilia with 170 participants to discuss the new [[science]]. Further conferences were held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and in [[Mexico]], in December 2009 for the study and promotion of remineralization worldwide.<ref>First International Conference on Rock Dust and Soil Health, University of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, December 2009</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHamaker conducted the groundwork for a mass movement of people concerned about the health of the world's soils, sustainable forests, climate change and improved nutrition from food. His proposal, [[rock dust]]ing, known to enhance plant growth by nourishing biological and chemical aspects of the rhizosphere, resulted in [[soil regeneration]] to boost global plant cover. This assisted Earth's self-regulation and offered a more natural [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] solution to the climate crisis not dependent on [[high technology]], or on-going climate manipulation by man.<ref>The Royal Society's Report on Geoengineering the Climate: Geoengineering or Geopiracy?, Sep 4 2009, ETC Group, Canada, etcgroup.org</ref> Some scientists have postulated that [[technological]] solutions may exist to assist the remineralization process, such as converting carbon dioxide into [[organic carbon]] to be mineralized as [[sediment]] before being weathered to soil.\n\n==Writings==\nHamaker's main book was ''The Survival Of Civilization'' (1983, 2002).<ref>[http://www.remineralize.org/don/synopsis01.html ''The Survival Of Civilization'', John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers, 1983, Remineralize The Earth 2002]</ref> He also produced various articles and publications from the 1960s to the 1990s.

Weaver remains involved in education campaigns to alert humanity to the climate crisis and foundational rock dust solution.\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n===Energy===\n\nHamaker's hypothesis is criticised because [[fossil fuel]] energy is potentially required to create and distribute rock dust, and this generates {{CO2}} when derived from fossil fuel, however, rock dust is predominantly a byproduct of the existing aggregate and quarrying industries <ref>[http://www.championtrees.org/topsoil/PitnQuarry.htm Soil remineralization: a future market for aggregate industry fines, Robert J. Able, June 1995, ''Pit & Quarry'']</ref> Future rock dust production for broad-scale soil remineralization can be powered by renewable sources, such as wind energy and bio-fuels grown on remineralized soils.\n\n===Climate control===\n\nSince land is naturally fertilized in glacial periods, remineralizing the Earth would emulate the glaciation process, allowing the reversal of what Hamaker and Weaver referred to as the ''interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession'' (decline in the [[NDVI|vegetative index]]).<ref>''The Survival of Civilization'', John Hamaker, Hamaker Weaver Publishers, 198</ref> They reasoned that this would indefinitely sustain the interglacial ecosystem and climate, or at least slow down the speed of re-glaciation.

He believed the coming glacial period would preceded by an interglacial-to-glacial transition phase already underway since the 1970s, and strongly advocated an intensive global co-operative soil remineralization effort to maintain the quantity of food while improving its quality. To achieve this, he recommended simultaneous remineralization of dying forests and soils, also needed to grow bio-fuels, as part of a goal to return excessive carbon dioxide to stable interglacial levels of 280 ppm.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Immobilization (soil science)]]\n*[[Mineralization (soil)]]\n*[[Noctilucent clouds]]\n*[[Remineralisation]]\n*[[Rockdust]]\n*[[Rock flour]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.renew-the-earth.org Renew The Earth]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hamaker, John}}\n[[Category:Sustainability advocates]]\n[[Category:Independent scientists]]\n[[Category:Non-fiction environmental writers]]\n[[Category:1914 births]]\n[[Category:1994 deaths]]\n[[Category:Geoengineers]]\n[[Category:American ecologists]]\n[[Category:American agronomists]]\n[[Category:American mechanical engineers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American engineers]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClimate control:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 2013-2041 \u2192 2013\u20132041", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Hamaker"}
