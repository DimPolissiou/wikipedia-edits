It was founded in 1645 and has had numerous locations over the years before its previous home. The college waa a co-educational, non-fee-paying [[secondary school]] and one of a number of [[Jesuit schools in Ireland]]. There were approximately 600 pupils in the school. \n\n==Organisation==\nCol\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id is run by a board of management comprising parent, teacher, and Jesuit representatives. It is non-fee-paying, co-educational, and has no school uniforms. Students study there from ages thirteen to eighteen and sit the [[Junior Certificate|Junior]] and [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] examinations. Each of the six-year groups is divided into four classes. The four groups are Gaeilge (\"Irish Stream\"), Xavier, Loyola, and Collins (G, X, L, C). Students are taught in similar ability classes throughout the school. The school is known locally as the 'Jes'.\n\nIn the fourth year (\"[[Transition Year]]\"), all students are reassigned into one of four classes, Brebeuf, Gonzaga, Ricci, or Claver (B, G, R, C). The classes return to the initial four groups in the fifth year for Irish classes only. The reorganisation of the groups for the fourth year is part of the school's \"[[Transition Year]]\" programme. While the Transition Year is optional in some Irish schools, it is compulsory in Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id.\n\n==History==\n\nSince 1620, the [[Jesuits]] have, with some involuntary intermissions, been working with and for the people of Galway. In 1645 their first school was founded through the generosity of Edmund Kirwan. While the language of the classroom was Latin, only the Jesuits with a fluent command of Irish were sent on the \u201cIrish Mission\u201d.<ref name=hist/>\n\nThe school, which was incorporated into a Jesuit residence in the present Abbeygate Street, continued in Galway through a time of political upheaval and military activity.<ref name=hist/>\n\nIn 1859, at the request of the [[Bishop of Galway]], the Jesuits once more took up residence in the city, this time in Prospect Hill and served in the nearby St. Patrick\u2019s Church. Within a year they had opened a college near the site of the present Bank of Ireland at 19 Eyre Square. The college\u2019s present location on Sea Road dates from 1863, when it was built the same year as the Jesuit church next door, [[St Ignatius Church, Galway|St Ignatius Church]].<ref name=hist/>\n\nThe modern phase of Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id began in 1929. The local enthusiasm for the language revival efforts of the emerging Republic of Ireland was to be served by a re-invigorated Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id, which became an Irish-medium School in 1931.<ref name=hist/>\n\nIn 1967, in contrast with its foundation of 1620, Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id became part of the \u201cnon-fee-paying\u201d secondary school system. In 1969, with the co-operation of management and staff, coupled with the help of parents, past pupils, and friends of the Jesuits, the present main school building, the Griffin Building, was built.<ref name=hist/>\n\nIn 1974, when the school population was increased to provide three-form entry, one co-educational form became the Irish-medium Scoil Gaeilge. Following consultation with staff and Jesuits, the school established the Board of Management in 1980 to take shared responsibility for all aspects of the school \u2013 the first agreed board of its kind in Ireland.<ref name=hist>[http://www.jesuit.ie/where-we-work/colaiste-iognaid Colaiste Iognaid] from Jesuits.ie, retrieved 8 April 2014</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the school underwent a buildings programme. This produced a new science block (O\u2019Reilly Building), a refurbished classroom block (Andrews Building), a library, and art, computer, and co-educational facilities. The Colombian Hall was refurbished and an indoor sports area was added. Co-education was extended to the whole school in 1984, to become the first fully co-educational secondary school in the city.<ref name=hist/>\n\nThe senator [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 C\u00e9idigh]] taught at Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id for a time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/news-and-events/news-archive/2003/february2003/nui-galway-announces-awards-for-outstanding-graduates.html|title=NUI Galway announces Awards for Outstanding Graduates|date=3 February 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n\nCol\u00e1\u00edste \u00cdogn\u00e1\u00edd is a non-fee-paying, co-educational, secondary school, comprising Jesuit and lay staff and catering to a broad spectrum of social and academic intake.

It was founded in 1645 and has had numerous locations over the years before its current home. The college is a co-educational, non-fee-paying [[secondary school]] and one of a number of [[Jesuit schools in Ireland]]. There are approximately 600 pupils in the school.\n\n==Organisation==\nCol\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id is run by a board of management comprising parent, teacher, and Jesuit representatives. It is non-fee-paying, co-educational, and has no school uniforms. Students study there from ages thirteen to eighteen and sit the [[Junior Certificate|Junior]] and [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] examinations. Each of the six-year groups is divided into four classes. The four groups are Gaeilge (\"Irish Stream\"), Xavier, Loyola, and Collins (G, X, L, C). Students are taught in similar ability classes throughout the school. The school is known locally as the 'Jes'.\n\nIn the fourth year (\"[[Transition Year]]\"), all students are reassigned into one of four classes, Brebeuf, Gonzaga, Ricci, or Claver (B, G, R, C). The classes return to the initial four groups in the fifth year for Irish classes only. The reorganisation of the groups for the fourth year is part of the school's \"[[Transition Year]]\" programme. While the Transition Year is optional in some Irish schools, it is compulsory in Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id.\n\n==History==\n\nSince 1620, the [[Jesuits]] have, with some involuntary intermissions, been working with and for the people of Galway. In 1645 their first school was founded through the generosity of Edmund Kirwan. While the language of the classroom was Latin, only the Jesuits with a fluent command of Irish were sent on the \u201cIrish Mission\u201d.<ref name=hist/>\n\nThe school, which was incorporated into a Jesuit residence in the present Abbeygate Street, continued in Galway through a time of political upheaval and military activity.<ref name=hist/>\n\nIn 1859, at the request of the [[Bishop of Galway]], the Jesuits once more took up residence in the city, this time in Prospect Hill and served in the nearby St. Patrick\u2019s Church. Within a year they had opened a college near the site of the present Bank of Ireland at 19 Eyre Square. The college\u2019s present location on Sea Road dates from 1863, when it was built the same year as the Jesuit church next door, [[St Ignatius Church, Galway|St Ignatius Church]].<ref name=hist/>\n\nThe modern phase of Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id began in 1929. The local enthusiasm for the language revival efforts of the emerging Republic of Ireland was to be served by a re-invigorated Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id, which became an Irish-medium School in 1931.<ref name=hist/>\n\nIn 1967, in contrast with its foundation of 1620, Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id became part of the \u201cnon-fee-paying\u201d secondary school system. In 1969, with the co-operation of management and staff, coupled with the help of parents, past pupils, and friends of the Jesuits, the present main school building, the Griffin Building, was built.<ref name=hist/>\n\nIn 1974, when the school population was increased to provide three-form entry, one co-educational form became the Irish-medium Scoil Gaeilge. Following consultation with staff and Jesuits, the school established the Board of Management in 1980 to take shared responsibility for all aspects of the school \u2013 the first agreed board of its kind in Ireland.<ref name=hist>[http://www.jesuit.ie/where-we-work/colaiste-iognaid Colaiste Iognaid] from Jesuits.ie, retrieved 8 April 2014</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the school underwent a buildings programme. This produced a new science block (O\u2019Reilly Building), a refurbished classroom block (Andrews Building), a library, and art, computer, and co-educational facilities. The Colombian Hall was refurbished and an indoor sports area was added. Co-education was extended to the whole school in 1984, to become the first fully co-educational secondary school in the city.<ref name=hist/>\n\nThe senator [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 C\u00e9idigh]] taught at Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id for a time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/news-and-events/news-archive/2003/february2003/nui-galway-announces-awards-for-outstanding-graduates.html|title=NUI Galway announces Awards for Outstanding Graduates|date=3 February 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n\nCol\u00e1\u00edste \u00cdogn\u00e1\u00edd is a non-fee-paying, co-educational, secondary school, comprising Jesuit and lay staff and catering to a broad spectrum of social and academic intake.

There are also options to study home economics, technical graphics, art, music (each student studies one of these), and German, which can be chosen instead of French.  \n \nTransition year follows the Junior Certificate and comprises a selection of courses designed within the school and taught as modules. The subjects taken are as follows: accounting, art - design & craft, career guidance, computers, English (in 4 modules - media studies, modern fiction, drama, creative writing), French, Gaeilge, geography, German, history, home economics, safety, home maintenance, mathematics, music, P.E., religious education, science, Spanish, and social studies.\n\nIn the two-year Senior cycle pupils prepare for the Leaving Certificate. In addition to religious education, pupils study Irish, English, maths, French, and a choice of three from chemistry, accountancy, German, art, physics, geography, economics, music, biology, history, business, home economics (social and scientific), and design and communication graphics.\n\n==Sport and extracurricular activities==\n\nStaff, parents, and former pupils undertake extracurricular activities voluntarily. It is expected that each pupil will participate in at least one of the activities provided. As circumstances allow, the school provides the following sports: rowing, Gaelic football, rugby, hockey, soccer, basketball, canoeing, athletics, swimming and mountaineering.<ref name=act>[http://colaisteiognaid.ie/activities/ Activities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408213337/http://colaisteiognaid.ie/activities/ |date=2014-04-08 }} from Colaiste Iognaid, retrieved 8 April 2014</ref>\n\nGaelic football is now very popular in the school.

Hard drives started to be used in portables, encouraged by the introduction of 3.5\" drives in the late 1980s, and became common in laptops starting with the introduction of 2.5\" and smaller drives around 1990; capacities have typically lagged behind physically larger desktop drives. Optical storage, [[read-only memory|read-only]] CD-ROM followed by writeable CD and later read-only or writeable DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] players, became common in laptops early in the 2000s.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Compaqarmada7800.jpg|thumb|[[Compaq]] Armada laptop from the late 1990s]]\n[[File:Macbook Air.jpg|thumb|Apple [[MacBook Air]], an ultraportable laptop weighing under {{convert|3.0|lb|kg|2|abbr=on}}]]\n[[File:ThinkPad X220.jpg|thumb|[[Lenovo]]'s [[ThinkPad]] business laptop, originally an [[IBM]] product]]\n\n[[File:Asus Transformer Pad TF701T Tablet and Keyboard Dock.png|thumb|[[ASUS Transformer|Asus Transformer Pad]], a hybrid tablet, powered by [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Operating system|OS]]]]\n[[File:Microsoft Surface Pro 3 with Type Cover.jpg|thumb|[[Microsoft Surface Pro 3]], 2-in-1 detachable]]\n[[File:Alienware.JPG|thumb|[[Alienware]] gaming laptop]]\n[[Image:Toughbook-cf-m34 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Toughbook|Panasonic Toughbook]] CF-M34, a rugged laptop/subnotebook]]\n\nSince the introduction of portable computers during the late 1970s, their form has changed significantly, [[spawning]] a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses.  Except where there is a distinct legal [[trademark]] around a term (notably [[Ultrabook]]), there are rarely hard distinctions between these classes and their usage has varied over time and between different sources.\n\n===Traditional laptop===\nThe form of the traditional laptop computer is a clamshell, with a screen on one of its inner sides and a keyboard on the opposite, facing the screen. It can be easily folded to conserve space while traveling. The screen and keyboard are inaccessible while closed. Devices of this form are commonly called a 'traditional laptop' or notebook, particularly if they have a screen size of 11 to 17 inches measured diagonally and run a full-featured operating system like [[Windows 10]], [[macOS]], or [[GNU]]/[[Linux_kernel|Linux]]. Traditional laptops are the most common form of laptops, although [[Chromebook]]s, Ultrabooks, convertibles and 2-in-1s (described below) are becoming more common, with similar performance being achieved in their more portable or affordable forms.\n\n===Subnotebook===\n{{Main|Subnotebook}}\n\nA ''subnotebook'' or an ''ultraportable'', is a laptop designed and marketed with an emphasis on portability (small size, low weight, and often longer battery life). Subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops, weighing between 0.8 and 2&nbsp;kg (2-5&nbsp;lb),<ref name=\"types_pcmag\" /> with a battery life exceeding 10 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |title=Breaking the Mold: New Lenovo ThinkPad laptop and Tablet PCs Defy Ultraportable Computing |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=Lenovo |date=23 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106182812/http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |archive-date=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the introduction of ''netbooks'' and ''ultrabooks'', the line between ''subnotebooks'' and either category has blurred.

The ''hybrids'', ''convertibles'' and ''2-in-1s'' emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a [[touchscreen]] display designed to allow users to work in a ''tablet'' mode, using either [[multi-touch]] gestures or a [[stylus (computing)|stylus]]/[[digital pen]].\n\n''Convertibles'' are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. ''Hybrids'' have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. ''2-in-1s'' can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed ''2-in-1 detachables'' and ''2-in-1 convertibles'' respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop [[operating system|OS]], such as [[Windows 10]]. 2-in-1s are often marketed as ''laptop replacement tablets''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/best-2-in-1-pcs-in-2020-when-you-need-a-laptop-and-tablet-in-one/|title=Best 2-in-1 PCs in 2020 for when you need a laptop and tablet in one|website=CNet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>.\n\n2-in-1s are often very thin, around {{convert|10|mm}}, and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an [[x86]]-architecture [[CPU]] (typically a low- or [[Ultra-low-voltage processor|ultra-low-voltage]] model), such as the Intel [[Intel Core|Core i5]], run a full-featured desktop [[operating system|OS]] like [[Windows 10]], and have a number of typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]].\n\n2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a [[media consumption]] device, but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run ''desktop'' applications, such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It is possible to connect multiple [[peripheral]] devices, such as a mouse, keyboard and a number of external displays to a modern 2-in-1.\n\n[[Microsoft Surface]] Pro-series devices and [[Surface Book]] are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachables, whereas [[Lenovo Yoga]]-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older [[Surface RT]] and [[Surface 2]] have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]] and [[Windows RT]] do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/laptop-faqs/what-is-hybrid/|title=What Is a Hybrid Laptop? {{!}} Advantages & Buying Guide {{!}} Lenovo US|website=www.lenovo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a [[mobile operating system]], such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. These include [[Asus Transformer|Asus's Transformer Pad]] devices, examples of [[hybrid tablet|hybrids]] with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall in the category of 2-in-1s.\n\n===Desktop replacement===\n{{Main|Desktop replacement computer}}\n{{See also|Gaming computer#Gaming laptop computers}}\n\nA desktop-replacement laptop is a class of large device which is not intended primarily for mobile use.

Rugged laptops are commonly used by public safety services (police, fire, and medical emergency), military, utilities, field service technicians, construction, mining, and oil drilling personnel. Rugged laptops are usually sold to organizations rather than individuals, and are rarely marketed via retail channels.\n\n===Business laptop===\nA business laptop is a laptop designed for those in a workplace. Typically, it is ruggedised, with consumer facing features, like high resolution [[sound card|sound]], removed to allow the device to be used for pure productivity. It may sometimes include business oriented features like [[Trusted Platform Module]], [[Fingerprint|fingerprint scanner]], [[smart card|smart card reader]] and/or a [[pointing stick]].\n\n==Hardware==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016|small=y}}\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n[[Image:Motherboards.png|thumb|right|Miniaturization: a comparison of a desktop computer motherboard ([[ATX]] form factor) to a motherboard from a 13\" laptop (2008 unibody [[Macbook]])]]\n[[Image:Laptop innen.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a [[VAIO|Sony VAIO]] laptop]]\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SODIMM]] memory module]]\n\nThe basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] and adapted to mobile use, although desktop systems increasingly use the same smaller, lower-power parts which were originally developed for mobile use. The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=D\u00e9 specialist voor smartphone, tablet en laptop reparaties|title=Laptop reparatie|url=https://www.smart-repair.nl/laptop/|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Smartrepair Den Bosch, Nijmegen, Tilburg, Almere en Utrecht|agency=www.smart-repair.nl|date=4 January 2013|language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable, with the exception of components which can be detached, such as a battery or CD/CDR/DVD drive. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large \"tower\" cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new [[motherboard]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and other components can be added. In a very compact laptop, such as laplets, there may be no upgradeable components at all.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+3+Teardown/26595|website=iFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]], and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards and inability to upgrade components.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Building Blocks Platform,|url=http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516184350/http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2006|publisher=Intel|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe following sections summarizes the differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in comparison to desktop personal computer parts.<ref name=\"parts-kate\">{{cite web |title = What Makes Laptops Work&nbsp;\u2013 The Laptop Motherboard |url = http://mobileoffice.about.com/od/laptopstabletpcs/tp/laptopmotherboards.htm |author = Catherine Roseberry |publisher = About.com |accessdate =15 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Display===\nInternally, a display is an LCD panel which could be CCFL or LED [[Backlight|backlit]] which interfaces to the laptop using the [[LVDS]] protocol, while externally, it can be a glossy screen or a matte screen. Most modern laptops feature a {{convert|13|in|cm}} [[viewable image size|VIS]] or larger color [[active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix display]] based on [[LED]] lighting with resolutions of 1280\u00d7800 ([[16:10]]) or 1366\u00d7768 ([[16:9]]) pixels and above. Models with LED-based lighting offer lower power consumption and often increased brightness. [[Netbook]]s with a {{convert|10|in|cm}} or smaller screen typically use a resolution of 1024\u00d7600, while netbooks and [[subnotebook]]s with an {{convert|11.6|in|cm}} or {{convert|12|in|cm}} screen use standard notebook resolutions. Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user's ability to multitask, although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area. Since the introduction of the [[MacBook Pro with Retina display]] in 2012, there has been an increase in the availability of very-high-resolution (1920\u00d71080 and higher) displays, even in relatively small systems, and in typical 15-inch screens resolutions as high as 3200\u00d71800 are available. External displays can be connected to most laptops, and models with a [[Mini DisplayPort]] can handle up to three.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\"/>\n\n===Central processing unit===\nA laptop's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) has advanced power-saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use. Typically, laptop CPUs made after 2018 have four processor cores, although 6-core and 8-core models are also available. For low price and mainstream performance, there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs, but at the high end, the fastest desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest laptop processors, at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat, while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts.\n\nThere have been a wide range of [[notebook processors|CPUs designed for laptops]] available from both [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and other manufacturers. On non-[[x86]] architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former [[PowerPC]]-based Apple laptops ([[iBook]] and [[PowerBook]]). Many laptops have removable CPUs, although this has become less common in the past few years as the trend has been towards thinner and lighter models. In other laptops the CPU is soldered on the motherboard and is non-replaceable; this is nearly universal in ultrabooks.\n\nIn the past, some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have had high performance gains at the cost of greater weight, heat, and limited battery life, but the practice was largely extinct as of 2013. Unlike their desktop counterparts, laptop CPUs are nearly impossible to [[overclocking|overclock]]. A thermal operating mode of laptops is very close to its limits and there is almost no headroom for an overclocking\u2013related operating temperature increase. The possibility of improving a cooling system of a laptop to allow overclocking is extremely difficult to implement.\n\n===Graphical processing unit===\nOn most laptops a [[graphical processing unit]] (GPU) is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the [[Intel Core|Core i-series]] of mobile processors in 2010, and similar [[accelerated processing unit]] (APU) processors by AMD later that year. Prior to that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the [[chipset#Computers|system chipset]], while higher end machines had a separate graphics processor. In the past, laptops lacking a separate graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors in the past few years. Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated, and in some cases even dual, graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is no demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient integrated graphics processor will be used. [[Nvidia Optimus]] and [[AMD Hybrid Graphics]] are examples of this sort of system of switchable graphics.\n\n===Memory===\nMost laptops use [[SO-DIMM]] (small outline dual in-line memory module) [[random-access memory|memory]] modules, as they are about half the size of desktop [[DIMM]]s.<ref name=\"parts-kate\"/> They are sometimes accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading, or placed in locations not intended for user replacement. Most laptops have two memory slots, although some of the lowest-end models will have only one, and some high end models (usually mobile engineering workstations and a few high-end models intended for gaming) have four slots. Most mid-range laptops are factory equipped with 4-8 GB of RAM. with higher-end laptops containing 16 GB of RAM or more. Netbooks are commonly equipped with only 1\u20132 GB of RAM and are generally only expandable to 2 GB, if at all. Laptops may have memory soldered to the motherboard to conserve space, which allows the laptop to have a thinner chassis design. Soldered memory cannot be easily upgraded.\n\n===Internal storage===\nTraditionally, laptops had a [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) as a main [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile storage]], but these proved inefficient for use in mobile devices due to high power consumption, heat production, and a presence of moving parts, which can cause damage to both the drive itself and the data stored when a laptop is unstable physically, e.g. during its use while transporting it or after its accidental drop. With the advent of [[flash memory]] technology, most mid- to high-end laptops opted for more compact, power efficient, and fast [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD), which eliminated the hazard of drive and data corruption caused by a laptop's physical impacts.<ref name=PCW-SSD>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=Evolution of the Solid-State Drive|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/evolution_of_the_solid_state_drive.html|website=PCWorld.com|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=17 January 2012}}</ref>  Most laptops use 2.5-inch drives, which are a smaller version of a 3.5-inch desktop drive form factor. 2.5-inch HDDs are more compact, power efficient, and produce less heat, while at the same time have a smaller capacity and a slower [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics#Data transfer rate|data transfer rate]]. Some very compact laptops support even smaller 1.8-inch HDDs. For SSDs, however, these miniaturization-related trade-offs are nonexistent, because SSDs were designed to have a very small footprint. SSDs feature a traditional 2.5- or 1.8-inch or a laptop-specific [[mSATA]] or [[M.2]] card's form factor. SSDs have a higher data transfer rate, lower power consumption, lower failure rate, and a larger capacity<ref name=\"behardware 2011\">BeHardware reported lower retailer return rates for SSDs than HDDs between April and October 2010. {{cite web | url=http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | title=Components returns rates | date=6 May 2011 | publisher=BeHardware | first=Marc | last=Prieur | accessdate=10 February 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214142908/http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | archive-date=14 February 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>A 2011 study by [[Intel]] on the use of 45,000 SSDs reported an annualized failure rate of 0.61% for SSDs, compared with 4.85% for HDDs. {{cite web | url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/it-management/intel-it/intel-it-validating-reliability-of-intel-solid-state-drives-brief.html | title=Validating the Reliability of Intel\u00ae Solid-State Drives |publisher=Intel|date=July 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"behardware 2012\">{{cite web | url = http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | publisher = BeHardware | title = Components returns rates (7) | first = Marc | last = Prieur | date = 16 November 2012 | accessdate = 25 August 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130809033951/http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | archive-date = 9 August 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Samsung 16TB SSD is the World's Largest Hard Drive|url = http://petapixel.com/2015/08/15/samsung-16tb-ssd-is-the-worlds-largest-hard-drive/|website = PetaPixel|accessdate = 20 September 2015}}</ref> compared to HDDs. However, HDDs have a significantly lower cost.\n\nMost laptops can contain a single 2.5-inch drive, but a small number of laptops with a screen wider than 15 inches can house two drives. Some laptops support a hybrid mode, combining a 2.5-inch drive, typically a spacious HDD for data, with an mSATA or M.2 SDD drive, typically having less capacity, but a significantly faster read/write speed. The [[operating system]] partition would be located on the SSD to increase laptop [[I/O]] performance. Another way to increase performance is to use a smaller SSD of 16-32 GB as a [[Hybrid drive#Dual-drive hybrid systems|cache drive]] with a compatible OS. Some laptops may have very limited drive upgradeability when the [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] used has a non-standard shape or requires a proprietary daughter card.<ref name=\"IFI-rMBP\">{{cite web|title=MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Late 2013 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18696|website=IFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> Some laptops have very limited space on the installed SSD, instead relying on availability of [[cloud storage]] services for storing of user data; [[Chromebooks]] are a prominent example of this approach. A variety of [[Hard disk drive#External hard disk drives|external HDDs]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] data storage servers with support of [[RAID]] technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[eSATA]], or [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], or over a wired or wireless network to further increase space for the storage of data. Many laptops also incorporate a [[card reader]] which allows for use of [[memory card]]s, such as those used for [[digital camera]]s, which are typically [[Secure Digital|SD]] or [[microSD]] cards. This enables users to download digital pictures from an SD card onto a laptop, thus enabling them to delete the SD card's contents to free up space for taking new pictures.\n\n===Removable media drive===\n[[Optical disc drive]]s capable of playing [[CD-ROM]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CD), [[DVD#DVD drives and players|DVDs]], and in some cases, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray disc]]s (BD),  were nearly universal on full-sized models by the early 2010s. A disc drive remains fairly common in laptops with a screen wider than {{convert|15|in|cm}}, although the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating these drives and players; these drives are uncommon in compact laptops, such as subnotebooks and netbooks. Laptop optical drives tend to follow a standard form factor, and usually have a standard [[mSATA]] connector. It is often possible to replace an optical drive with a newer model. In certain laptop models there is a possibility to replace an optical drive with a second hard drive, using a caddy that fills the extra space the optical drive would have occupied.\n\n===Inputs===\n[[File:Acer CB5-311 series touchpad.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a [[touchpad]] on an [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] laptop]]\n[[File:Trackpoint Assembly.JPG|thumb|200px|Closeup of a [[TrackPoint]] cursor and UltraNav buttons on a [[ThinkPad]] laptop]]\nAn alphanumeric keyboard is used to enter text and data and make other commands (e.g., [[function key]]s). A [[touchpad]] (also called a trackpad), a [[pointing stick]], or both, are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, and an integrated keyboard<ref>Most keyboards are not illuminated. Some models of laptop feature an illuminated keyboard.</ref> is used for typing. An external keyboard and mouse may be connected using a [[USB]] port or wirelessly, via [[Bluetooth]] or similar technology. With the advent of ultrabooks and support of touch input on screens by 2010-era operating systems, such as [[Windows 8.1]], [[multitouch]] [[touchscreen]] displays are used in many models. Some models have [[webcam]]s and [[microphone]]s, which can be used to communicate with other people with both moving images and sound, via [[Skype]], [[Google Hangouts Chat|Google Chat]] and similar software.\nLaptops typically have USB ports and a microphone jack, for use with an external mic. Some laptops have a [[card reader]] for reading digital camera SD cards.\n\n===Input/output (I/O) ports===\nOn a typical laptop there are several [[USB]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s, an external monitor port ([[VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]] or [[Mini DisplayPort]]), an audio in/out port (often in form of a single socket) is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, utilizing [[DisplayPort#Multi-Stream Transport|multi-stream transport]] technology.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Configuration 3-Displays FAQ|url=http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-033714.htm|website=Intel.com|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], in a 2015 version of its [[MacBook]], transitioned from a number of different [[I/O]] ports to a single [[USB-C]] port.<ref name=MacBook_2015>{{cite web|title=Apple \u2014 MacBook \u2014 Tech Specs|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/|website=apple.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] adapters. [[Google]], with its updated version of [[Chromebook Pixel]], shows a similar transition trend towards USB-C, although keeping older USB Type-A ports for a better compatibility with older devices.<ref name=ChromebookPixel_2015>{{cite web|title=Chromebook Pixel|url=https://www.google.com/chromebook/pixel/|website=google.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> Although being common until the end of the 2000s decade, [[Ethernet]] network port are rarely found on modern laptops, due to widespread use of [[wireless network]]ing, such as [[Wi-Fi]]. [[Legacy port]]s such as a [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard/mouse port, [[serial port]], [[parallel port]], or [[FireWire]] are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] ports, but [[Thunderbolt 3]] uses USB-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect external headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.\n\n===Expansion cards===\nIn the past, a [[PC Card]] (formerly [[PCMCIA]]) or [[ExpressCard]] slot for expansion was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality, even when the laptop is powered on; these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of [[USB 3.0]]. Some internal subsystems such as: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards, usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop. The standard for such cards is [[PCI Express]], which comes in both [[PCI Express Mini Card|mini]] and even smaller [[M.2]] sizes. In newer laptops, it is not uncommon to also see [[Micro SATA#mSATA|Micro SATA]] (mSATA) functionality on PCI Express Mini or M.2 card slots allowing the use of those slots for SATA-based solid state drives.<ref name=\"parts-cards\">{{cite web|title=Innovations in Notebook Expansion |url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428031253/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89  |archive-date=28 April 2005 |author=Gabriel Torres |date=25 November 2004 |publisher=Hardware Secrets, LLC |accessdate=15 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Battery and power supply ===\n{{Main|Smart battery}}\n[[File:HP Laptop Battery.jpg|thumb|Almost all laptops use [[Smart battery|smart batteries]]]]\n2016-era laptops use [[lithium ion]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], with some thinner models using the flatter [[lithium polymer]] technology. These two technologies have largely replaced the older [[nickel metal-hydride]] batteries. Battery life is highly variable by model and workload and can range from one hour to nearly a day. A battery's performance gradually decreases over time; substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |title=HP EliteBook 6930p Notebook PC specifications \u2013 HP Products and Services Products |publisher=H10010.www1.hp.com |date=25 May 2009 |access-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103622/http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA laptop's battery is charged using an external [[power supply]], which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically in the range of 7.2\u201424 volts. The power supply is usually external and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about {{convert|400|g|lb}} to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a [[smart battery]], a rechargeable [[battery pack]] with a built-in [[battery management system]] (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and State of Health (SoH) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Waste heat]] from operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. Early laptops used [[heat sink]]s placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on [[heat pipe]]s to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. It is believed that some designs with metal cases, like Apple's aluminum [[MacBook Pro]] and [[MacBook Air]], also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink, allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core. Secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with laptops to reduce operating temperatures.\n\n===Docking station===\n[[Image:Docking station 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Docking station and laptop]]\n\nA [[docking station]] (sometimes referred to simply as a ''dock'') is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports, and in some cases expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to \"[[Road warrior (computing)|road warrior]]\" employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a [[Docking station#Port replicator|port replicator]]. These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through [[USB]] or [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]].\n\n===Charging trolleys===\n[[Laptop charging trolley]]s, also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple [[laptops]], [[netbooks]], and [[tablet computer]]s at the same time.

Schools, especially those with [[open plan]] designs, are often prime targets for [[thieves]] who steal high-value items. Laptops, netbooks, and tablets are among the highest\u2013value portable items in a school. Moreover, laptops can easily be concealed under clothing and stolen from buildings. Many types of laptop\u2013charging trolleys are designed and constructed to protect against theft. They are generally made out of steel, and the laptops remain locked up while not in use. Although the trolleys can be moved between areas from one classroom to another, they can often be mounted or locked to the floor or walls to prevent thieves from stealing the laptops, especially overnight.<ref name=\"doug\" />\n\n===Solar panels===\n{{main|Solar notebook}}\n\nIn some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Gavin|title=The SOLAR-POWERED Ubuntu laptop|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/07/ubuntu_solar_powered_laptop/|publisher=THE REGISTER|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> The [[One Laptop Per Child]] Initiative released the [[OLPC XO-1]] laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITHNbOrPQyM |title=OLPC XO laptop powered by a solar panel |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Presently, they are designing an [[OLPC XO-3]] laptop with these features.

Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of [[neoprene]], with sturdier ones made of [[LRPu|low-resilience polyurethane]]. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in [[ballistic nylon]] to provide some measure of [[waterproofing]]. Bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a [[laptop cooler]], a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow. Some stores sell laptop pads which enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.\n\n===Changes in certain features===\n\nSome of the components of earlier models of laptops can easily be replaced without opening completely its bottom part, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc.\n\nSome of the components of recent models of laptop reside inside. Replacing most of its components, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc., requires removal of its either top or bottom part, removal of motherboard, and returning them back.\n\n===Obsolete features===\n[[File:3Com modem - Ethernet PCMCIA in IBM 9547.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[modem]] [[PCMCIA]] card on an old ThinkPad]]\n\nFeatures that certain early models of laptops used to have that are not available in most current laptops include:\n* Reset (\"cold restart\") button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Instant power off button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Integrated charger or power adapter inside the laptop\n* [[Floppy disk drive]]\n* [[Serial port]]\n* [[Parallel port]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* Shared [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] input device port\n* [[VHS]] or [[8 mm video format|8mm]] VCR\n* [[IrDA]]\n* [[S-video]] port{{NoteTag|Unconfirmed if this exists in most recent models of laptops.}}\n* [[PC Card]] / [[PCMCIA]] slot\n* [[ExpressCard]] slot\n* [[CD Drive|CD/DVD Drives]] (starting with 2013 models)\n* [[VGA port]] (starting with 2013 models)\n\n==Comparison with desktops==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File:Astrid Gruppefremvisning.jpg|thumb|A teacher using laptop as part of a workshop for school children]]\n[[File:Jimmy Wales accessing Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] using a laptop on a park bench]]\n\n'''Portability''' is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop PCs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Should I buy a laptop or desktop? | publisher = IT Division&nbsp;\u2013 University of Wisconsin | date = 19 March 2008 | url = http://kb.wisc.edu/showroom/page.php?id=3044 | accessdate =27 November 2008 }}</ref> Physical portability allows a laptop to be used in many places\u2014not only at home and at the office, but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients' locations or at a meeting room, etc. Within a home, portability enables laptop users to move their device from the living room to the dining room to the family room. Portability offers several distinct advantages:\n* '''Productivity''': Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used can help employees and students to increase their productivity on work or school tasks. For example, an office worker reading their work e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, or a student doing their homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures.\n* '''Immediacy''': Carrying a laptop means having instant access to information, including personal and work files. This allows better collaboration between coworkers or students, as a laptop can be flipped open to look at a report, document, spreadsheet, or presentation anytime and anywhere.\n* '''Up-to-date information''': If a person has more than one desktop PC, a problem of synchronization arises: changes made on one computer are not automatically propagated to the others. There are ways to resolve this problem, including physical transfer of updated files (using a USB flash memory stick or CD-ROMs) or using synchronization software over the Internet, such as [[cloud computing]]. However, transporting a single laptop to both locations avoids the problem entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.\n* '''Connectivity''': In the 2010s, a proliferation of [[Wi-Fi]] wireless networks and cellular broadband data services ([[HSDPA]], [[EVDO]] and others) in many urban centers, combined with near-ubiquitous Wi-Fi support by modern laptops{{NoteTag|Almost all laptops contain a Wi-Fi interface; broadband cellular devices are available widely as extension cards and USB devices, and also as internal cards in select models.}} meant that a laptop could now have easy [[Internet]] and local network connectivity while remaining mobile. Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Faster Wi-Fi Predicted for Colleges | newspaper = The Chronicle of Higher Education | author = Josh Fischman | date = 7 August 2008| url = http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3226/faster-wifi-predicted-for-colleges | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of laptops:\n* '''Size''': Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away in a desk drawer.\n* '''Low power consumption''': Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20\u2013120 W, compared to 100\u2013800 W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for large businesses, which run hundreds of personal computers thus multiplying the potential savings, and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.).\n* '''Quiet''': Laptops are typically much quieter than desktops, due both to the components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.\n* '''Battery''': a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts. A desktop PC needs an [[Uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) to handle short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving on-battery time of more than 20\u201330 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS.<ref>A sample line of UPS devices and on-battery power: {{cite web | title = Back-UPS RS | publisher = APC | url = http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=23 | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* '''All-in-One''': designed to be portable, most 2010-era laptops have all components integrated into the chassis (however, some small laptops may not have an internal CD/CDR/DVD drive, so an external drive needs to be used). For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is divided into the desktop \"tower\" (the unit with the CPU, hard drive, power supply, etc.), keyboard, mouse, display screen, and optional peripherals such as speakers.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCompared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:\n\n====Performance====\nWhile the performance of mainstream desktops and laptop is comparable, and the cost of laptops has fallen less rapidly than desktops, laptops remain more expensive than desktop PCs at the same performance level.<ref>In a comparison between laptop and desktop of equal cost, the desktop's System Benchmark Score was twice that of the laptop. {{cite web | title = What to Buy, a Notebook or Desktop PC? | publisher = Tom's Hardware | date = 11 June 2008 | url = http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/desktop-vs-notebook,1946-7.html | accessdate =28 November 2008}}</ref> The upper limits of performance of laptops remain much lower than the highest-end desktops (especially \"workstation class\" machines with two processor sockets), and \"bleeding-edge\" features usually appear first in desktops and only then, as the underlying technology matures, are adapted to laptops.\n\nFor Internet browsing and typical office applications, where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input, even relatively low-end laptops (such as Netbooks) can be fast enough for some users.<ref>For example, a review of the [[MSI Wind Netbook]] says that \"''The device is rarely sluggish in general use. It renders Web pages quickly, launches most applications without becoming too bogged down and generally doesn't feel like it's a budget laptop.''\" {{cite web | last = Reid | first = Rory | title = MSI Wind Review | publisher = CNET Australia | date = 7 July 2008 | url = http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | accessdate = 28 November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205092148/http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | archivedate = 5 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Most higher-end laptops are sufficiently powerful for high-resolution movie playback, some 3D gaming and video editing and encoding. However, laptop processors can be disadvantaged when dealing with a higher-end database, maths, engineering, financial software, virtualization, etc. This is because laptops use the mobile versions of processors to conserve power, and these lag behind desktop chips when it comes to performance. Some manufacturers work around this performance problem by using desktop CPUs for laptops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/07/14/rock-delivers-bd-core-i7-equipped-xtreme-790-and-xtreme-840-ga/|title=Rock delivers BD / Core i7-equipped Xtreme 790 and Xtreme 840 gaming laptops|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n====Upgradeability====\nUpgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops, which are thoroughly standardized. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Optical drives and [[internal expansion card]]s may be upgraded if they follow an [[Technical standard|industry standard]], but all other internal components, including the motherboard, CPU and graphics, are not always intended to be upgradeable. [[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]] and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards. The reasons for limited upgradeability are both technical and economic. There is no industry-wide standard [[Computer form factor|form factor]] for laptops; each major laptop manufacturer pursues its own [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] design and construction, with the result that laptops are difficult to upgrade and have high repair costs. Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SDD, RAM, Keyboard...) in order to reduce size and upgradeability prospects. Devices such as sound cards, network adapters, hard and optical drives, and numerous other peripherals are available, but these upgrades usually impair the laptop's portability, because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is on the move.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ergonomics and health effects====\n\n=====Wrists=====\n[[Image:laptop-coaster.jpg|thumb|[[Laptop cooler]] (silver) under laptop (white), preventing heating of lap and improving laptop airflow]]\n\nProlonged use of laptops can cause [[repetitive strain injury]] because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices,.<ref>{{cite web| last = Toub| first = Allegra| title = Take It Easy on Those Keyboards| publisher = Backlight Resumes| date = 23 May 2017| url = http://blog.backlightresumes.com/take-it-easy-on-those-keyboards| accessdate = 23 May 2017}}</ref> Usage of separate, external [[ergonomic keyboard]]s and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.\n\n=====Neck and spine=====\nA laptop's integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view, which can cause neck or spinal injuries. A larger and higher-quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate this and to provide additional screen space for more productive work. Another solution is to use a [[Docking station#Computer stands|computer stand]].\n\n=====Possible effect on fertility=====\nA study by [[State University of New York]] researchers found that heat generated from laptops can increase the temperature of the lap of male users when balancing the computer on their lap, potentially putting [[sperm count]] at risk. The study, which included roughly two dozen men between the ages of 21 and 35, found that the sitting position required to balance a laptop can increase scrotum temperature by as much as {{convert|2.1|C-change|0}}.

Components such as screen hinges, latches, [[DC connector|power jack]]s, and [[power cord]]s deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and may have to be replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer, result in a costly repair or entire replacement of laptops. One study found that a laptop is three times more likely to break during the first year of use than a desktop.<ref>{{cite web| title = Gartner: Notebook PCs still prone to hardware failure| date = 27 June 2006| publisher = IDG News Service / ITWorld| url = http://www.itworld.com/060627notebookpc| accessdate =27 November 2008}}</ref> To maintain a laptop, it is recommended to clean it every three months for dirt, debris, dust, and food particles. Most cleaning kits consist of a lint-free or [[microfiber]] cloth for the LCD screen and keyboard, compressed air for getting dust out of the cooling fan, and cleaning solution. Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geier|first=Eric|title=Zen and the Art of Laptop Maintenance|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260438/zen_and_the_art_of_laptop_maintenance.html|work=PC World|accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===== Parts replacement =====\nOriginal external components are expensive and usually proprietary and non-interchangeable; other parts are inexpensive\u2014a power jack can cost a few dollars\u2014but their replacement may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician. Other inexpensive but fragile parts often cannot be purchased separately from larger more expensive components. For example, the video display cable and the backlight power cable that pass through the lid hinges to connect the motherboard to the screen may eventually break from repeated opening and closing of the lid. These tiny cables usually cannot be purchased from the original manufacturer separate from the entire LCD panel, with the price of hundreds of dollars, although for popular models an aftermarket in pulled parts generally exists. The repair costs of a failed motherboard or LCD panel often exceeds the value of a used laptop. Parts can also be ordered from third party vendors.\n\n=====Heating and cooling=====\nLaptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a [[computer fan|fan]] and [[heat sink]] that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. A complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).\n\n===== Battery life =====\nBattery life is limited because the capacity drops with time, eventually requiring replacement after as little as a year. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours, depending on usage, configuration, and power management settings. Yet, as it ages, the battery's energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and discharging time. Some laptops (specifically ultrabooks) do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have its battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive.\n\n====Security and privacy====\n{{Main|Laptop theft}}\nBecause they are valuable, commonly used, portable, and easy to hide in a backpack or other type of travel bag, laptops are often [[laptop theft|stolen]]. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/services/dell_lost_laptop_study.pdf], Ponemon Institute, Airport Insecurity: The Case of Lost Laptops, June 2008</ref> The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems ([[identity theft]], [[credit card fraud]], breach of privacy), can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself. Consequently, physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance. Most laptops have a [[Kensington security slot]], which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock. In addition, modern operating systems and [[disk encryption software|third-party software]] offer [[disk encryption]] functionality, which renders the data on the laptop's [[hard drive]] unreadable without a [[key (cryptography)|key]] or a passphrase. As of 2015, some laptops also have additional security elements added, including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.laptop-security-pro.com/biometric-devices.html|title= Secure File Sharing|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website= Biometric Devices and Laptop Security|publisher= Laptop Security Pro|accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSoftware such as LoJack for Laptops, Laptop Cop, and GadgetTrack have been engineered to help people locate and recover their stolen laptop in the event of theft. Setting one's laptop with a password on its firmware (protection against going to firmware setup or booting), internal HDD/SSD (protection against accessing it and loading an operating system on it afterwards), and every user account of the operating system are additional security measures that a user should do.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186235/how-to-secure-your-computer-with-a-bios-or-uefi-password/|title=How to Secure Your Computer With a BIOS or UEFI Password|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186881/hard-disk-passwords-explained-should-you-set-one-to-secure-your-files/|title=Hard Disk Passwords Explained: Should You Set One to Secure Your Files?|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref> Fewer than 5% of lost or stolen laptops are recovered by the companies that own them,<ref>[http://www.intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html#.UP2bUFSzBJN#ixzz2Ucm2oKSg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606040557/http://intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html|date=6 June 2013}}, Ponemon Institute, The Billion Dollar Lost Laptop Problem, September 2010</ref> however, that number may decrease due to a variety of companies and software solutions specializing in laptop recovery.

Several major brands that offer notebooks in various classes are listed in the adjacent box.\nThe major brands usually offer good service and support, including well-executed documentation and driver downloads that remain available for many years after a particular laptop model is no longer produced. Capitalizing on service, support, and brand image, laptops from major brands are more expensive than laptops by smaller brands and [[Original design manufacturer|ODMs]]. Some brands specialize in a particular class of laptops, such as gaming laptops ([[Alienware]]), high-performance laptops ([[HP Envy]]), netbooks ([[EeePC]]) and laptops for children ([[One Laptop per Child|OLPC]]).\n\nMany brands, including the major ones, do not design and do not manufacture their laptops. Instead, a small number of Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) design new models of laptops, and the brands choose the models to be included in their lineup. In 2006, 7 major ODMs manufactured 7 of every 10 laptops in the world, with the largest one ([[Quanta Computer]]) having 30% of world market share.<ref>{{cite web |title=Identical Laptops, Different Prices: Don't Be Fooled by Branding |url-access=registration |publisher=Info-Tech Research Group |date=10 October 2006 |url= http://www.infotech.com/research/identical-laptops-different-prices-dont-be-fooled-by-branding |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref> Therefore, identical models are available both from a major label and from a low-profile ODM in-house brand.\n\n=== Market share ===\nBattery-powered portable computers had just 2% worldwide market share in 1986.<ref>{{cite news| title = Lap-top computers gain stature as power grows| work = Daily News of Los Angeles (CA)| date = 12 April 1987| url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&p_theme=la&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EF513A9C40DA46F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM| accessdate =1 November 2008 }}</ref> However, laptops have become increasingly popular, both for business and personal use.<ref name=\"Computer Economics, Inc\">{{cite web| title = The Falling Costs of Mobile Computing| work = Falling Costs of Mobile Computing Drive Corporate Adoption| publisher = Computer Economics, Inc.|date=December 2005| url = http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1084| accessdate =1 November 2008 }}</ref> Around 109 million notebook PCs shipped worldwide in 2007, a growth of 33% compared to 2006.<ref name=\"ssev2011-09-12\">[http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20080131PD209.html Worldwide notebook shipments grow 33% on year in 2007, says IDC], 31 January 2008, Yen Ting Chen, DigiTimes, retrieved at 12 September 2011</ref> In 2008 it was estimated that 145.9 million notebooks were sold, and that the number would grow in 2009 to 177.7 million.<ref name=\"ee2009-01-10\">[http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=YN1M2POYEMEN0QSNDLSCKHA?articleID=212701251 Analysis: Did Intel underestimate netbook success?], Accessed at 10 January 2009</ref> The third quarter of 2008 was the first time when worldwide notebook PC shipments exceeded [[Desktop computer|desktops]], with 38.6 million units versus 38.5 million units.<ref name=\"Computer Economics, Inc\"/><ref name=\"is2009-01-13\">[http://www.isuppli.com/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=19823 Notebook PC Shipments Exceed Desktops for First Time in Q3], isuppli.com, accessed at 13 January 2009</ref><ref name=\"NYT09\">{{cite news| title =The PC Doesn't Have to Be an Anchor|work=The New York Times|author= Randall Stross| date =18 April 2008| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/business/19digi.html?_r=1&ref=technology| accessdate =20 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/04/17/intel_laptop_desktop_crossover/ |title=Intel: laptop/desktop crossover coming sooner than expected |work=The Register, UK |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007091449/http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/04/17/intel_laptop_desktop_crossover/ |archive-date=7 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nMay 2005 was the first time notebooks outsold desktops in the US over the course of a full month; at the time notebooks sold for an average of $1,131 while desktops sold for an average of $696.<ref>Michael Singer.

Although these toxins are relatively harmless when the laptop is in use, concerns that discarded laptops cause a serious health risk and toxic environment damage, were so strong, that the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in Europe specified that all laptop computers must be recycled by law. Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ([[Epargyreus clarus|EPA]]) has outlawed [[landfill]] dumping or the incinerating of discarded laptop computers.\n\nMost laptop computers begin the recycling process with a method known as Demanufacturing ([[Demanufacture]]), this involves the physical separation of the components of the laptop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/where_to_recycle/business_laptops/what_to_do_with_used_office_laptops.html|title=Laptop Disposal Ewaste Recycling and IT asset disposition (ITAD)|last=Recycling|first=Newtech|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  These components are then either grouped into materials (e.g. plastic, metal and glass) for recycling or more complex items that require more advanced materials separation (e.g.) circuit boards, hard drives and batteries.\n\nCorporate laptop recycling can require an additional process known as data destruction.

Subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops, weighing between 0.8 and 2&nbsp;kg (2-5&nbsp;lb),<ref name=\"types_pcmag\" /> with a battery life exceeding 10 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |title=Breaking the Mold: New Lenovo ThinkPad laptop and Tablet PCs Defy Ultraportable Computing |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=Lenovo |date=23 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106182812/http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |archive-date=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the introduction of ''netbooks'' and ''ultrabooks'', the line between ''subnotebooks'' and either category has blurred. Netbooks are a more basic and cheaper type of subnotebook, and while some ultrabooks have a screen size too large to qualify as subnotebooks, certain ultrabooks fit in the subnotebook category. One notable example of a subnotebook is the [[Apple MacBook Air]].\n\n===Netbook===\n{{main|Netbook}}\n\nThe netbook is an inexpensive, light-weight, energy-efficient form of laptop, especially suited for wireless communication and Internet access.<ref name=\"upenn\">{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-net-impact-of-netbooks-it-depends-on-who-uses-them-for-what/|title=The Net Impact of Netbooks?

The ''hybrids'', ''convertibles'' and ''2-in-1s'' emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a [[touchscreen]] display designed to allow users to work in a ''tablet'' mode, using either [[multi-touch]] gestures or a [[stylus (computing)|stylus]]/[[digital pen]].\n\n''Convertibles'' are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. ''Hybrids'' have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. ''2-in-1s'' can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed ''2-in-1 detachables'' and ''2-in-1 convertibles'' respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop [[operating system|OS]], such as [[Windows 10]]. 2-in-1s are often marketed as ''laptop replacement tablets''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/best-2-in-1-pcs-in-2020-when-you-need-a-laptop-and-tablet-in-one/|title=Best 2-in-1 PCs in 2020 for when you need a laptop and tablet in one|website=CNet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>.\n\n2-in-1s are often very thin, around {{convert|10|mm}}, and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an [[x86]]-architecture [[CPU]] (typically a low- or [[Ultra-low-voltage processor|ultra-low-voltage]] model), such as the Intel [[Intel Core|Core i5]], run a full-featured desktop [[operating system|OS]] like [[Windows 10]], and have a number of typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]].\n\n2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a [[media consumption]] device, but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run ''desktop'' applications, such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It is possible to connect multiple [[peripheral]] devices, such as a mouse, keyboard and a number of external displays to a modern 2-in-1.\n\n[[Microsoft Surface]] Pro-series devices and [[Surface Book]] are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachables, whereas [[Lenovo Yoga]]-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older [[Surface RT]] and [[Surface 2]] have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]] and [[Windows RT]] do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/laptop-faqs/what-is-hybrid/|title=What Is a Hybrid Laptop? {{!}} Advantages & Buying Guide {{!}} Lenovo US|website=www.lenovo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a [[mobile operating system]], such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. These include [[Asus Transformer|Asus's Transformer Pad]] devices, examples of [[hybrid tablet|hybrids]] with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall in the category of 2-in-1s.\n\n===Desktop replacement===\n{{Main|Desktop replacement computer}}\n{{See also|Gaming computer#Gaming laptop computers}}\n\nA desktop-replacement laptop is a class of large device which is not intended primarily for mobile use. These devices are bulkier and not as portable as other laptops, and are intended for use as compact and transportable alternatives to a desktop computer.<ref name=\"types_cnet\">{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7602_7-1016082-2.html |title=Laptop Buying Guide |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. }}</ref> Desktop replacements are larger and typically heavier than other classes of laptops. They are capable of containing more powerful components and have a 15-inch or larger display.<ref name=\"types_cnet\"/> Desktop replacement laptops' operation time on batteries is typically shorter than other laptops; in rare cases they have no [[battery (electricity)|battery]] at all. In the past, some laptops in this class used a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance for the same price at the expense of battery life, although this practice has largely died out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com/2100-1040-979763.html |title=Desktop notebooks stake their claim |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |date=8 January 2003 }}</ref> The names ''Media Center Laptops'' and ''Gaming Laptops'' are used to describe specialized notebook computers, often overlapping with the desktop replacement form factor.<ref name=\"types_pcmag\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2311016,00.asp |title= Types of Laptops: How Do You Compute |accessdate=7 November 2008 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc. |date=18 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Rugged laptop===\n{{Main|Rugged computer}}\n\nA rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are usually designed from scratch, rather than adapted from regular consumer laptop models. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/rugged-laptop.html |title=Rugged Laptop: Choices, Pointers &amp; Specs of Buying Rugged Laptops |accessdate=27 November 2008 |publisher=Linux-on-laptops.com}}</ref> and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.\n\nThe design features found in rugged laptops include a rubber sheeting under the keyboard keys, sealed port and connector covers, passive cooling, very bright displays easily readable in daylight, cases and frames made of lightweight magnesium alloys that are much stronger than plastics found in commercial laptops, and solid-state storage devices or hard disk drives that are shock mounted to withstand constant vibrations. Rugged laptops are commonly used by public safety services (police, fire, and medical emergency), military, utilities, field service technicians, construction, mining, and oil drilling personnel. Rugged laptops are usually sold to organizations rather than individuals, and are rarely marketed via retail channels.\n\n===Business laptop===\nA business laptop is a laptop designed for those in a workplace. Typically, it is ruggedised, with consumer facing features, like high resolution [[sound card|sound]], removed to allow the device to be used for pure productivity. It may sometimes include business oriented features like [[Trusted Platform Module]], [[Fingerprint|fingerprint scanner]], [[smart card|smart card reader]] and/or a [[pointing stick]].\n\n==Hardware==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016|small=y}}\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n[[Image:Motherboards.png|thumb|right|Miniaturization: a comparison of a desktop computer motherboard ([[ATX]] form factor) to a motherboard from a 13\" laptop (2008 unibody [[Macbook]])]]\n[[Image:Laptop innen.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a [[VAIO|Sony VAIO]] laptop]]\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SODIMM]] memory module]]\n\nThe basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] and adapted to mobile use, although desktop systems increasingly use the same smaller, lower-power parts which were originally developed for mobile use. The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=D\u00e9 specialist voor smartphone, tablet en laptop reparaties|title=Laptop reparatie|url=https://www.smart-repair.nl/laptop/|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Smartrepair Den Bosch, Nijmegen, Tilburg, Almere en Utrecht|agency=www.smart-repair.nl|date=4 January 2013|language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable, with the exception of components which can be detached, such as a battery or CD/CDR/DVD drive. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large \"tower\" cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new [[motherboard]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and other components can be added. In a very compact laptop, such as laplets, there may be no upgradeable components at all.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+3+Teardown/26595|website=iFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]], and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards and inability to upgrade components.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Building Blocks Platform,|url=http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516184350/http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2006|publisher=Intel|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe following sections summarizes the differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in comparison to desktop personal computer parts.<ref name=\"parts-kate\">{{cite web |title = What Makes Laptops Work&nbsp;\u2013 The Laptop Motherboard |url = http://mobileoffice.about.com/od/laptopstabletpcs/tp/laptopmotherboards.htm |author = Catherine Roseberry |publisher = About.com |accessdate =15 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Display===\nInternally, a display is an LCD panel which could be CCFL or LED [[Backlight|backlit]] which interfaces to the laptop using the [[LVDS]] protocol, while externally, it can be a glossy screen or a matte screen. Most modern laptops feature a {{convert|13|in|cm}} [[viewable image size|VIS]] or larger color [[active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix display]] based on [[LED]] lighting with resolutions of 1280\u00d7800 ([[16:10]]) or 1366\u00d7768 ([[16:9]]) pixels and above. Models with LED-based lighting offer lower power consumption and often increased brightness. [[Netbook]]s with a {{convert|10|in|cm}} or smaller screen typically use a resolution of 1024\u00d7600, while netbooks and [[subnotebook]]s with an {{convert|11.6|in|cm}} or {{convert|12|in|cm}} screen use standard notebook resolutions. Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user's ability to multitask, although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area. Since the introduction of the [[MacBook Pro with Retina display]] in 2012, there has been an increase in the availability of very-high-resolution (1920\u00d71080 and higher) displays, even in relatively small systems, and in typical 15-inch screens resolutions as high as 3200\u00d71800 are available. External displays can be connected to most laptops, and models with a [[Mini DisplayPort]] can handle up to three.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\"/>\n\n===Central processing unit===\nA laptop's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) has advanced power-saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use. Typically, laptop CPUs made after 2018 have four processor cores, although 6-core and 8-core models are also available. For low price and mainstream performance, there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs, but at the high end, the fastest desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest laptop processors, at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat, while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts.\n\nThere have been a wide range of [[notebook processors|CPUs designed for laptops]] available from both [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and other manufacturers. On non-[[x86]] architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former [[PowerPC]]-based Apple laptops ([[iBook]] and [[PowerBook]]). Many laptops have removable CPUs, although this has become less common in the past few years as the trend has been towards thinner and lighter models. In other laptops the CPU is soldered on the motherboard and is non-replaceable; this is nearly universal in ultrabooks.\n\nIn the past, some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have had high performance gains at the cost of greater weight, heat, and limited battery life, but the practice was largely extinct as of 2013. Unlike their desktop counterparts, laptop CPUs are nearly impossible to [[overclocking|overclock]]. A thermal operating mode of laptops is very close to its limits and there is almost no headroom for an overclocking\u2013related operating temperature increase. The possibility of improving a cooling system of a laptop to allow overclocking is extremely difficult to implement.\n\n===Graphical processing unit===\nOn most laptops a [[graphical processing unit]] (GPU) is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the [[Intel Core|Core i-series]] of mobile processors in 2010, and similar [[accelerated processing unit]] (APU) processors by AMD later that year. Prior to that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the [[chipset#Computers|system chipset]], while higher end machines had a separate graphics processor. In the past, laptops lacking a separate graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors in the past few years. Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated, and in some cases even dual, graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is no demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient integrated graphics processor will be used. [[Nvidia Optimus]] and [[AMD Hybrid Graphics]] are examples of this sort of system of switchable graphics.\n\n===Memory===\nMost laptops use [[SO-DIMM]] (small outline dual in-line memory module) [[random-access memory|memory]] modules, as they are about half the size of desktop [[DIMM]]s.<ref name=\"parts-kate\"/> They are sometimes accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading, or placed in locations not intended for user replacement. Most laptops have two memory slots, although some of the lowest-end models will have only one, and some high end models (usually mobile engineering workstations and a few high-end models intended for gaming) have four slots. Most mid-range laptops are factory equipped with 4-8 GB of RAM. with higher-end laptops containing 16 GB of RAM or more. Netbooks are commonly equipped with only 1\u20132 GB of RAM and are generally only expandable to 2 GB, if at all. Laptops may have memory soldered to the motherboard to conserve space, which allows the laptop to have a thinner chassis design. Soldered memory cannot be easily upgraded.\n\n===Internal storage===\nTraditionally, laptops had a [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) as a main [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile storage]], but these proved inefficient for use in mobile devices due to high power consumption, heat production, and a presence of moving parts, which can cause damage to both the drive itself and the data stored when a laptop is unstable physically, e.g. during its use while transporting it or after its accidental drop. With the advent of [[flash memory]] technology, most mid- to high-end laptops opted for more compact, power efficient, and fast [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD), which eliminated the hazard of drive and data corruption caused by a laptop's physical impacts.<ref name=PCW-SSD>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=Evolution of the Solid-State Drive|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/evolution_of_the_solid_state_drive.html|website=PCWorld.com|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=17 January 2012}}</ref>  Most laptops use 2.5-inch drives, which are a smaller version of a 3.5-inch desktop drive form factor. 2.5-inch HDDs are more compact, power efficient, and produce less heat, while at the same time have a smaller capacity and a slower [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics#Data transfer rate|data transfer rate]]. Some very compact laptops support even smaller 1.8-inch HDDs. For SSDs, however, these miniaturization-related trade-offs are nonexistent, because SSDs were designed to have a very small footprint. SSDs feature a traditional 2.5- or 1.8-inch or a laptop-specific [[mSATA]] or [[M.2]] card's form factor. SSDs have a higher data transfer rate, lower power consumption, lower failure rate, and a larger capacity<ref name=\"behardware 2011\">BeHardware reported lower retailer return rates for SSDs than HDDs between April and October 2010. {{cite web | url=http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | title=Components returns rates | date=6 May 2011 | publisher=BeHardware | first=Marc | last=Prieur | accessdate=10 February 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214142908/http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | archive-date=14 February 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>A 2011 study by [[Intel]] on the use of 45,000 SSDs reported an annualized failure rate of 0.61% for SSDs, compared with 4.85% for HDDs. {{cite web | url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/it-management/intel-it/intel-it-validating-reliability-of-intel-solid-state-drives-brief.html | title=Validating the Reliability of Intel\u00ae Solid-State Drives |publisher=Intel|date=July 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"behardware 2012\">{{cite web | url = http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | publisher = BeHardware | title = Components returns rates (7) | first = Marc | last = Prieur | date = 16 November 2012 | accessdate = 25 August 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130809033951/http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | archive-date = 9 August 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Samsung 16TB SSD is the World's Largest Hard Drive|url = http://petapixel.com/2015/08/15/samsung-16tb-ssd-is-the-worlds-largest-hard-drive/|website = PetaPixel|accessdate = 20 September 2015}}</ref> compared to HDDs. However, HDDs have a significantly lower cost.\n\nMost laptops can contain a single 2.5-inch drive, but a small number of laptops with a screen wider than 15 inches can house two drives. Some laptops support a hybrid mode, combining a 2.5-inch drive, typically a spacious HDD for data, with an mSATA or M.2 SDD drive, typically having less capacity, but a significantly faster read/write speed. The [[operating system]] partition would be located on the SSD to increase laptop [[I/O]] performance. Another way to increase performance is to use a smaller SSD of 16-32 GB as a [[Hybrid drive#Dual-drive hybrid systems|cache drive]] with a compatible OS. Some laptops may have very limited drive upgradeability when the [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] used has a non-standard shape or requires a proprietary daughter card.<ref name=\"IFI-rMBP\">{{cite web|title=MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Late 2013 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18696|website=IFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> Some laptops have very limited space on the installed SSD, instead relying on availability of [[cloud storage]] services for storing of user data; [[Chromebooks]] are a prominent example of this approach. A variety of [[Hard disk drive#External hard disk drives|external HDDs]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] data storage servers with support of [[RAID]] technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[eSATA]], or [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], or over a wired or wireless network to further increase space for the storage of data. Many laptops also incorporate a [[card reader]] which allows for use of [[memory card]]s, such as those used for [[digital camera]]s, which are typically [[Secure Digital|SD]] or [[microSD]] cards. This enables users to download digital pictures from an SD card onto a laptop, thus enabling them to delete the SD card's contents to free up space for taking new pictures.\n\n===Removable media drive===\n[[Optical disc drive]]s capable of playing [[CD-ROM]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CD), [[DVD#DVD drives and players|DVDs]], and in some cases, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray disc]]s (BD),  were nearly universal on full-sized models by the early 2010s. A disc drive remains fairly common in laptops with a screen wider than {{convert|15|in|cm}}, although the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating these drives and players; these drives are uncommon in compact laptops, such as subnotebooks and netbooks. Laptop optical drives tend to follow a standard form factor, and usually have a standard [[mSATA]] connector. It is often possible to replace an optical drive with a newer model. In certain laptop models there is a possibility to replace an optical drive with a second hard drive, using a caddy that fills the extra space the optical drive would have occupied.\n\n===Inputs===\n[[File:Acer CB5-311 series touchpad.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a [[touchpad]] on an [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] laptop]]\n[[File:Trackpoint Assembly.JPG|thumb|200px|Closeup of a [[TrackPoint]] cursor and UltraNav buttons on a [[ThinkPad]] laptop]]\nAn alphanumeric keyboard is used to enter text and data and make other commands (e.g., [[function key]]s). A [[touchpad]] (also called a trackpad), a [[pointing stick]], or both, are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, and an integrated keyboard<ref>Most keyboards are not illuminated. Some models of laptop feature an illuminated keyboard.</ref> is used for typing. An external keyboard and mouse may be connected using a [[USB]] port or wirelessly, via [[Bluetooth]] or similar technology. With the advent of ultrabooks and support of touch input on screens by 2010-era operating systems, such as [[Windows 8.1]], [[multitouch]] [[touchscreen]] displays are used in many models. Some models have [[webcam]]s and [[microphone]]s, which can be used to communicate with other people with both moving images and sound, via [[Skype]], [[Google Hangouts Chat|Google Chat]] and similar software.\nLaptops typically have USB ports and a microphone jack, for use with an external mic. Some laptops have a [[card reader]] for reading digital camera SD cards.\n\n===Input/output (I/O) ports===\nOn a typical laptop there are several [[USB]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s, an external monitor port ([[VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]] or [[Mini DisplayPort]]), an audio in/out port (often in form of a single socket) is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, utilizing [[DisplayPort#Multi-Stream Transport|multi-stream transport]] technology.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Configuration 3-Displays FAQ|url=http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-033714.htm|website=Intel.com|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], in a 2015 version of its [[MacBook]], transitioned from a number of different [[I/O]] ports to a single [[USB-C]] port.<ref name=MacBook_2015>{{cite web|title=Apple \u2014 MacBook \u2014 Tech Specs|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/|website=apple.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] adapters.

[[Legacy port]]s such as a [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard/mouse port, [[serial port]], [[parallel port]], or [[FireWire]] are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] ports, but [[Thunderbolt 3]] uses USB-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect external headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.\n\n===Expansion cards===\nIn the past, a [[PC Card]] (formerly [[PCMCIA]]) or [[ExpressCard]] slot for expansion was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality, even when the laptop is powered on; these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of [[USB 3.0]]. Some internal subsystems such as: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards, usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop. The standard for such cards is [[PCI Express]], which comes in both [[PCI Express Mini Card|mini]] and even smaller [[M.2]] sizes. In newer laptops, it is not uncommon to also see [[Micro SATA#mSATA|Micro SATA]] (mSATA) functionality on PCI Express Mini or M.2 card slots allowing the use of those slots for SATA-based solid state drives.<ref name=\"parts-cards\">{{cite web|title=Innovations in Notebook Expansion |url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428031253/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89  |archive-date=28 April 2005 |author=Gabriel Torres |date=25 November 2004 |publisher=Hardware Secrets, LLC |accessdate=15 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Battery and power supply ===\n{{Main|Smart battery}}\n[[File:HP Laptop Battery.jpg|thumb|Almost all laptops use [[Smart battery|smart batteries]]]]\n2016-era laptops use [[lithium ion]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], with some thinner models using the flatter [[lithium polymer]] technology. These two technologies have largely replaced the older [[nickel metal-hydride]] batteries. Battery life is highly variable by model and workload and can range from one hour to nearly a day. A battery's performance gradually decreases over time; substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |title=HP EliteBook 6930p Notebook PC specifications \u2013 HP Products and Services Products |publisher=H10010.www1.hp.com |date=25 May 2009 |access-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103622/http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA laptop's battery is charged using an external [[power supply]], which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically in the range of 7.2\u201424 volts. The power supply is usually external and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about {{convert|400|g|lb}} to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a [[smart battery]], a rechargeable [[battery pack]] with a built-in [[battery management system]] (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and State of Health (SoH) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Waste heat]] from operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. Early laptops used [[heat sink]]s placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on [[heat pipe]]s to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. It is believed that some designs with metal cases, like Apple's aluminum [[MacBook Pro]] and [[MacBook Air]], also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink, allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core. Secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with laptops to reduce operating temperatures.\n\n===Docking station===\n[[Image:Docking station 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Docking station and laptop]]\n\nA [[docking station]] (sometimes referred to simply as a ''dock'') is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports, and in some cases expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to \"[[Road warrior (computing)|road warrior]]\" employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a [[Docking station#Port replicator|port replicator]]. These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through [[USB]] or [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]].\n\n===Charging trolleys===\n[[Laptop charging trolley]]s, also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple [[laptops]], [[netbooks]], and [[tablet computer]]s at the same time. The trolleys are used in schools that have replaced their traditional static computer labs<ref name=\"doug\">{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Dough|title=Getting rid of the ICT suite|url=http://dougwoods.co.uk/blog/getting-rid-of-the-ict-suite/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006051528/http://dougwoods.co.uk/blog/getting-rid-of-the-ict-suite/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 October 2010|work=Blog}}</ref> suites of desktop equipped with \"tower\" computers, but do not have enough plug sockets in an individual classroom to charge all of the devices.

Schools, especially those with [[open plan]] designs, are often prime targets for [[thieves]] who steal high-value items. Laptops, netbooks, and tablets are among the highest\u2013value portable items in a school. Moreover, laptops can easily be concealed under clothing and stolen from buildings. Many types of laptop\u2013charging trolleys are designed and constructed to protect against theft. They are generally made out of steel, and the laptops remain locked up while not in use. Although the trolleys can be moved between areas from one classroom to another, they can often be mounted or locked to the floor or walls to prevent thieves from stealing the laptops, especially overnight.<ref name=\"doug\" />\n\n===Solar panels===\n{{main|Solar notebook}}\n\nIn some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Gavin|title=The SOLAR-POWERED Ubuntu laptop|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/07/ubuntu_solar_powered_laptop/|publisher=THE REGISTER|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> The [[One Laptop Per Child]] Initiative released the [[OLPC XO-1]] laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITHNbOrPQyM |title=OLPC XO laptop powered by a solar panel |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Presently, they are designing an [[OLPC XO-3]] laptop with these features.

Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of [[neoprene]], with sturdier ones made of [[LRPu|low-resilience polyurethane]]. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in [[ballistic nylon]] to provide some measure of [[waterproofing]]. Bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a [[laptop cooler]], a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow. Some stores sell laptop pads which enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.\n\n===Changes in certain features===\n\nSome of the components of earlier models of laptops can easily be replaced without opening completely its bottom part, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc.\n\nSome of the components of recent models of laptop reside inside. Replacing most of its components, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc., requires removal of its either top or bottom part, removal of motherboard, and returning them back.\n\n===Obsolete features===\n[[File:3Com modem - Ethernet PCMCIA in IBM 9547.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[modem]] [[PCMCIA]] card on an old ThinkPad]]\n\nFeatures that certain early models of laptops used to have that are not available in most current laptops include:\n* Reset (\"cold restart\") button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Instant power off button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Integrated charger or power adapter inside the laptop\n* [[Floppy disk drive]]\n* [[Serial port]]\n* [[Parallel port]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* Shared [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] input device port\n* [[VHS]] or [[8 mm video format|8mm]] VCR\n* [[IrDA]]\n* [[S-video]] port{{NoteTag|Unconfirmed if this exists in most recent models of laptops.}}\n* [[PC Card]] / [[PCMCIA]] slot\n* [[ExpressCard]] slot\n* [[CD Drive|CD/DVD Drives]] (starting with 2013 models)\n* [[VGA port]] (starting with 2013 models)\n\n==Comparison with desktops==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File:Astrid Gruppefremvisning.jpg|thumb|A teacher using laptop as part of a workshop for school children]]\n[[File:Jimmy Wales accessing Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] using a laptop on a park bench]]\n\n'''Portability''' is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop PCs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Should I buy a laptop or desktop? | publisher = IT Division&nbsp;\u2013 University of Wisconsin | date = 19 March 2008 | url = http://kb.wisc.edu/showroom/page.php?id=3044 | accessdate =27 November 2008 }}</ref> Physical portability allows a laptop to be used in many places\u2014not only at home and at the office, but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients' locations or at a meeting room, etc. Within a home, portability enables laptop users to move their device from the living room to the dining room to the family room. Portability offers several distinct advantages:\n* '''Productivity''': Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used can help employees and students to increase their productivity on work or school tasks. For example, an office worker reading their work e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, or a student doing their homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures.\n* '''Immediacy''': Carrying a laptop means having instant access to information, including personal and work files. This allows better collaboration between coworkers or students, as a laptop can be flipped open to look at a report, document, spreadsheet, or presentation anytime and anywhere.\n* '''Up-to-date information''': If a person has more than one desktop PC, a problem of synchronization arises: changes made on one computer are not automatically propagated to the others. There are ways to resolve this problem, including physical transfer of updated files (using a USB flash memory stick or CD-ROMs) or using synchronization software over the Internet, such as [[cloud computing]]. However, transporting a single laptop to both locations avoids the problem entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.\n* '''Connectivity''': In the 2010s, a proliferation of [[Wi-Fi]] wireless networks and cellular broadband data services ([[HSDPA]], [[EVDO]] and others) in many urban centers, combined with near-ubiquitous Wi-Fi support by modern laptops{{NoteTag|Almost all laptops contain a Wi-Fi interface; broadband cellular devices are available widely as extension cards and USB devices, and also as internal cards in select models.}} meant that a laptop could now have easy [[Internet]] and local network connectivity while remaining mobile. Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Faster Wi-Fi Predicted for Colleges | newspaper = The Chronicle of Higher Education | author = Josh Fischman | date = 7 August 2008| url = http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3226/faster-wifi-predicted-for-colleges | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of laptops:\n* '''Size''': Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away in a desk drawer.\n* '''Low power consumption''': Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20\u2013120 W, compared to 100\u2013800 W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for large businesses, which run hundreds of personal computers thus multiplying the potential savings, and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.).\n* '''Quiet''': Laptops are typically much quieter than desktops, due both to the components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.\n* '''Battery''': a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts. A desktop PC needs an [[Uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) to handle short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving on-battery time of more than 20\u201330 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS.<ref>A sample line of UPS devices and on-battery power: {{cite web | title = Back-UPS RS | publisher = APC | url = http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=23 | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* '''All-in-One''': designed to be portable, most 2010-era laptops have all components integrated into the chassis (however, some small laptops may not have an internal CD/CDR/DVD drive, so an external drive needs to be used). For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is divided into the desktop \"tower\" (the unit with the CPU, hard drive, power supply, etc.), keyboard, mouse, display screen, and optional peripherals such as speakers.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCompared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:\n\n====Performance====\nWhile the performance of mainstream desktops and laptop is comparable, and the cost of laptops has fallen less rapidly than desktops, laptops remain more expensive than desktop PCs at the same performance level.<ref>In a comparison between laptop and desktop of equal cost, the desktop's System Benchmark Score was twice that of the laptop. {{cite web | title = What to Buy, a Notebook or Desktop PC? | publisher = Tom's Hardware | date = 11 June 2008 | url = http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/desktop-vs-notebook,1946-7.html | accessdate =28 November 2008}}</ref> The upper limits of performance of laptops remain much lower than the highest-end desktops (especially \"workstation class\" machines with two processor sockets), and \"bleeding-edge\" features usually appear first in desktops and only then, as the underlying technology matures, are adapted to laptops.\n\nFor Internet browsing and typical office applications, where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input, even relatively low-end laptops (such as Netbooks) can be fast enough for some users.<ref>For example, a review of the [[MSI Wind Netbook]] says that \"''The device is rarely sluggish in general use. It renders Web pages quickly, launches most applications without becoming too bogged down and generally doesn't feel like it's a budget laptop.''\" {{cite web | last = Reid | first = Rory | title = MSI Wind Review | publisher = CNET Australia | date = 7 July 2008 | url = http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | accessdate = 28 November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205092148/http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | archivedate = 5 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Most higher-end laptops are sufficiently powerful for high-resolution movie playback, some 3D gaming and video editing and encoding. However, laptop processors can be disadvantaged when dealing with a higher-end database, maths, engineering, financial software, virtualization, etc. This is because laptops use the mobile versions of processors to conserve power, and these lag behind desktop chips when it comes to performance. Some manufacturers work around this performance problem by using desktop CPUs for laptops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/07/14/rock-delivers-bd-core-i7-equipped-xtreme-790-and-xtreme-840-ga/|title=Rock delivers BD / Core i7-equipped Xtreme 790 and Xtreme 840 gaming laptops|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n====Upgradeability====\nUpgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops, which are thoroughly standardized. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Optical drives and [[internal expansion card]]s may be upgraded if they follow an [[Technical standard|industry standard]], but all other internal components, including the motherboard, CPU and graphics, are not always intended to be upgradeable. [[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]] and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards. The reasons for limited upgradeability are both technical and economic. There is no industry-wide standard [[Computer form factor|form factor]] for laptops; each major laptop manufacturer pursues its own [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] design and construction, with the result that laptops are difficult to upgrade and have high repair costs. Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SDD, RAM, Keyboard...) in order to reduce size and upgradeability prospects. Devices such as sound cards, network adapters, hard and optical drives, and numerous other peripherals are available, but these upgrades usually impair the laptop's portability, because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is on the move.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ergonomics and health effects====\n\n=====Wrists=====\n[[Image:laptop-coaster.jpg|thumb|[[Laptop cooler]] (silver) under laptop (white), preventing heating of lap and improving laptop airflow]]\n\nProlonged use of laptops can cause [[repetitive strain injury]] because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices,.<ref>{{cite web| last = Toub| first = Allegra| title = Take It Easy on Those Keyboards| publisher = Backlight Resumes| date = 23 May 2017| url = http://blog.backlightresumes.com/take-it-easy-on-those-keyboards| accessdate = 23 May 2017}}</ref> Usage of separate, external [[ergonomic keyboard]]s and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.\n\n=====Neck and spine=====\nA laptop's integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view, which can cause neck or spinal injuries. A larger and higher-quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate this and to provide additional screen space for more productive work. Another solution is to use a [[Docking station#Computer stands|computer stand]].\n\n=====Possible effect on fertility=====\nA study by [[State University of New York]] researchers found that heat generated from laptops can increase the temperature of the lap of male users when balancing the computer on their lap, potentially putting [[sperm count]] at risk.

Components such as screen hinges, latches, [[DC connector|power jack]]s, and [[power cord]]s deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and may have to be replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer, result in a costly repair or entire replacement of laptops.

Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geier|first=Eric|title=Zen and the Art of Laptop Maintenance|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260438/zen_and_the_art_of_laptop_maintenance.html|work=PC World|accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===== Parts replacement =====\nOriginal external components are expensive and usually proprietary and non-interchangeable; other parts are inexpensive\u2014a power jack can cost a few dollars\u2014but their replacement may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician. Other inexpensive but fragile parts often cannot be purchased separately from larger more expensive components. For example, the video display cable and the backlight power cable that pass through the lid hinges to connect the motherboard to the screen may eventually break from repeated opening and closing of the lid. These tiny cables usually cannot be purchased from the original manufacturer separate from the entire LCD panel, with the price of hundreds of dollars, although for popular models an aftermarket in pulled parts generally exists. The repair costs of a failed motherboard or LCD panel often exceeds the value of a used laptop. Parts can also be ordered from third party vendors.\n\n=====Heating and cooling=====\nLaptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a [[computer fan|fan]] and [[heat sink]] that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. A complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).\n\n===== Battery life =====\nBattery life is limited because the capacity drops with time, eventually requiring replacement after as little as a year. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours, depending on usage, configuration, and power management settings. Yet, as it ages, the battery's energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and discharging time. Some laptops (specifically ultrabooks) do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have its battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive.\n\n====Security and privacy====\n{{Main|Laptop theft}}\nBecause they are valuable, commonly used, portable, and easy to hide in a backpack or other type of travel bag, laptops are often [[laptop theft|stolen]]. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/services/dell_lost_laptop_study.pdf], Ponemon Institute, Airport Insecurity: The Case of Lost Laptops, June 2008</ref> The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems ([[identity theft]], [[credit card fraud]], breach of privacy), can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself. Consequently, physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance. Most laptops have a [[Kensington security slot]], which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock. In addition, modern operating systems and [[disk encryption software|third-party software]] offer [[disk encryption]] functionality, which renders the data on the laptop's [[hard drive]] unreadable without a [[key (cryptography)|key]] or a passphrase. As of 2015, some laptops also have additional security elements added, including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.laptop-security-pro.com/biometric-devices.html|title= Secure File Sharing|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website= Biometric Devices and Laptop Security|publisher= Laptop Security Pro|accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSoftware such as LoJack for Laptops, Laptop Cop, and GadgetTrack have been engineered to help people locate and recover their stolen laptop in the event of theft. Setting one's laptop with a password on its firmware (protection against going to firmware setup or booting), internal HDD/SSD (protection against accessing it and loading an operating system on it afterwards), and every user account of the operating system are additional security measures that a user should do.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186235/how-to-secure-your-computer-with-a-bios-or-uefi-password/|title=How to Secure Your Computer With a BIOS or UEFI Password|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186881/hard-disk-passwords-explained-should-you-set-one-to-secure-your-files/|title=Hard Disk Passwords Explained: Should You Set One to Secure Your Files?|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref> Fewer than 5% of lost or stolen laptops are recovered by the companies that own them,<ref>[http://www.intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html#.UP2bUFSzBJN#ixzz2Ucm2oKSg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606040557/http://intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html|date=6 June 2013}}, Ponemon Institute, The Billion Dollar Lost Laptop Problem, September 2010</ref> however, that number may decrease due to a variety of companies and software solutions specializing in laptop recovery.

Several major brands that offer notebooks in various classes are listed in the adjacent box.\nThe major brands usually offer good service and support, including well-executed documentation and driver downloads that remain available for many years after a particular laptop model is no longer produced. Capitalizing on service, support, and brand image, laptops from major brands are more expensive than laptops by smaller brands and [[Original design manufacturer|ODMs]]. Some brands specialize in a particular class of laptops, such as gaming laptops ([[Alienware]]), high-performance laptops ([[HP Envy]]), netbooks ([[EeePC]]) and laptops for children ([[One Laptop per Child|OLPC]]).\n\nMany brands, including the major ones, do not design and do not manufacture their laptops. Instead, a small number of Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) design new models of laptops, and the brands choose the models to be included in their lineup.

Although these toxins are relatively harmless when the laptop is in use, concerns that discarded laptops cause a serious health risk and toxic environment damage, were so strong, that the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in Europe specified that all laptop computers must be recycled by law. Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ([[Epargyreus clarus|EPA]]) has outlawed [[landfill]] dumping or the incinerating of discarded laptop computers.\n\nMost laptop computers begin the recycling process with a method known as Demanufacturing ([[Demanufacture]]), this involves the physical separation of the components of the laptop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/where_to_recycle/business_laptops/what_to_do_with_used_office_laptops.html|title=Laptop Disposal Ewaste Recycling and IT asset disposition (ITAD)|last=Recycling|first=Newtech|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  These components are then either grouped into materials (e.g. plastic, metal and glass) for recycling or more complex items that require more advanced materials separation (e.g.) circuit boards, hard drives and batteries.\n\nCorporate laptop recycling can require an additional process known as data destruction.

There is no distinction between ''town'' and ''city'' in Germany; a ''Stadt'' is an independent municipality (see [[Municipalities of Germany]]) that has been given the right to use that title. In contrast, the generally smaller German municipalities that don't use this title, and are thus not included here, are usually just called ''Gemeinden''. Historically, the title ''Stadt'' was associated with [[Town privileges|town privileges]], but today it is a mere honorific title. The title can be bestowed to a municipality by its respective [[States of Germany|state government]] and is generally given to such municipalities that have either had historic town rights or have attained considerable size and importance more recently. Towns with over 100,000 inhabitants are called ''Gro\u00dfstadt'', a statistical notion sometimes translated as \"city\", but having no effect on their administrative status. In this list, only the cities' and towns' names are given.

cities and towns in [[Germany]] (as of January 1st, 2020). There is no distinction between ''town'' and ''city'' in Germany; a ''Stadt'' is an independent municipality (see [[Municipalities of Germany]]) that has been given the right to use that title. In contrast, the generally smaller German municipalities that don't use this title, and are thus not included here, are usually just called ''Gemeinden''. Historically, the title ''Stadt'' was associated with [[Town privileges|town privileges]], but today it is a mere honorific title. The title can be bestowed to a municipality by its respective [[States of Germany|state government]] and is generally given to such municipalities that have either had historic town rights or have attained considerable size and importance more recently. Towns with over 100,000 inhabitants are called ''Gro\u00dfstadt'', a statistical notion sometimes translated as \"city\", but having no effect on their administrative status. In this list, only the cities' and towns' names are given. For more restricted lists with more details, see:\n* [[List of cities in Germany by population]] (only ''Gro\u00dfst\u00e4dte'', i.e. cities over 100,000 population)\n* [[Metropolitan Regions in
