Alaska and [[Louisiana]] are the only states that do not call their first-order administrative subdivisions [[County (United States)|counties]] (Louisiana uses [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parishes]] instead).<ref name=\"DLWD\">{{cite web|url=http://live.laborstats.alaska.gov/pop/estimates/data/TotalPopulationBCA.xls|accessdate=2020-03-01|title=Alaska Population Estimates|work=Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development}}</ref>\n\nMany of the most densely populated regions of the state are part of Alaska's boroughs, which function similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county equivalents in the other 49 states, the organized boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. There are four different classes of organized boroughs: \"Unified Home Rule\" (may exercise all legislative powers not prohibited by law or charter); \"Non-unified Home Rule\"; \"First Class\" (may exercise any power not prohibited by law on non-area wide basis by adopting ordinances); and \"Second Class\" (must gain voter approval for authority to exercise many non-area wide powers).<ref>[https://www.akml.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/FinalPrimer2017-Revised.pdf Alaska Municipal League: Alaska Local Government Primer]</ref>\n\nThe area not part of any organized borough is referred to as the Unorganized Borough. The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], in cooperation with the state, divides the Unorganized Borough into 11 [[Census tract|census area]]s, each roughly corresponding to an election district, thus totaling 30 county equivalents. However, these areas exist solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation; they have no government of their own. Boroughs and census areas are both treated as county-level equivalents by the Census Bureau.\n\nSome areas in the unorganized borough receive limited public services directly from the Alaska state government, usually law enforcement from the [[Alaska State Troopers]] and educational funding.\n\nSix [[consolidated city-county|consolidated city-borough]] governments exist&mdash;[[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau City and Borough]], [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway Municipality]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka City and Borough]], [[Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska|Yakutat City and Borough]], [[Wrangell City and Borough]], as well as the state's largest city, [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]. Though its legal name is the ''Municipality of Anchorage,'' it is considered a consolidated city-borough under state law.\n\nThe [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] (FIPS) 55-2,3,4 codes, which are used by the [[United States Census Bureau]] to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip6-4.htm|title= FIPS Publish 6-4|publisher= National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate= 2007-04-11|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130929074056/http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip6-4.htm|archive-date= 2013-09-29|url-status= dead}}</ref> Alaska's code is 02, so each code is of the format 02XXX.

However, unlike county equivalents in the other 49 states, the organized boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. There are four different classes of organized boroughs: \"Unified Home Rule\" (may exercise all legislative powers not prohibited by law or charter); \"Non-unified Home Rule\"; \"First Class\" (may exercise any power not prohibited by law on non-area wide basis by adopting ordinances); and \"Second Class\" (must gain voter approval for authority to exercise many non-area wide powers).<ref>[https://www.akml.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/FinalPrimer2017-Revised.pdf Alaska Municipal League: Alaska Local Government Primer]</ref>\n\nThe area not part of any organized borough is referred to as the Unorganized Borough. The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], in cooperation with the state, divides the Unorganized Borough into 11 [[Census tract|census area]]s, each roughly corresponding to an election district, thus totaling 30 county equivalents. However, these areas exist solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation; they have no government of their own. Boroughs and census areas are both treated as county-level equivalents by the Census Bureau.\n\nSome areas in the unorganized borough receive limited public services directly from the Alaska state government, usually law enforcement from the [[Alaska State Troopers]] and educational funding.\n\nSix [[consolidated city-county|consolidated city-borough]] governments exist&mdash;[[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau City and Borough]], [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway Municipality]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka City and Borough]], [[Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska|Yakutat City and Borough]], [[Wrangell City and Borough]], as well as the state's largest city, [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]. Though its legal name is the ''Municipality of Anchorage,'' it is considered a consolidated city-borough under state law.\n\nThe [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] (FIPS) 55-2,3,4 codes, which are used by the [[United States Census Bureau]] to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip6-4.htm|title= FIPS Publish 6-4|publisher= National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate= 2007-04-11|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130929074056/http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip6-4.htm|archive-date= 2013-09-29|url-status= dead}}</ref> Alaska's code is 02, so each code is of the format 02XXX.

He calls upon Tigtone to find the source of the beauty plague, (Which has already claimed Helpy, making him incredibly handsome) and put an end to it, to \"re-uglify\" the land. Their travels lead them to a kingdom of stunningly gorgeous unicorns residing above the clouds, who are locked in battle with each other to determine who is the most beautiful. Amidst the chaos of the battling unicorns, Tigtone meets an ugly unicorn named Zlotovf ([[Alan Oppenheimer]]), who explains that their bloodshed is what's causing the beauty plague in Tigtone's realm, and reveals another hidden world above the unicorn's, where a race of hideously ugly creatures reside. Tigtone and Helpy journey to this realm, and upon discovering that the creatures' tears reverse the unicorn's blood, Tigtone verbally abuses them until they cry an uglifying rain upon the land.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=3\n| EpisodeNumber2=3\n| Title=...and the Wine Crisis\n| WrittenBy=Andreas Trolf\n| Aux2=Sean Glaze and Stanley Von Medvey\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|1|20}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= A wine shortage has wracked Propecia, and several of the land's vineyards have gone missing, leaving the populace without much-desired wine to drink.

Tigtone and Helpy's travels lead them to an untouched vineyard, where they happily drink their fill of wine, only for the entire vineyard (along with the rest of Propecia's vineyards) to be uprooted by a band of sky pirates, lead by the vicious air pirate Zuviell ([[Grey Delisle]]). Tigtone fights Zuviell to a standstill, and he and Helpy are forced to retreat. Tigtone soon hatches a plan to rid themselves of the sky pirates, by turning Helpy into a vampire, and unleashing them upon the pirates in their slumber. They awaken in horror to discover their transformation, only for Tigtone to explain that they no longer crave wine, but blood instead. Upon realizing this, Zuviell declares they will no longer steal wine, and returns the stolen vineyards to Propecia, where they set to drinking the blood of its denizens.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=4\n| EpisodeNumber2=4\n| Title=...and Those Elemental Kings\n| WrittenBy=Andrew Koehler\n| Aux2=Frederic Cristy, Sean Glaze, and Stanley Von Medvey\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|1|20}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= Tigtone regales Helpy with a story of the time he discovered an enchanted doorway, which only could be opened with several symbols of power held by four elemental kings.

Helpy then asks what Tigtone discovered behind the doorway once he got it open, only for Tigtone to remember that he never opened the door after receiving the symbols. The two of them immediately head to the doorway's location to see for themselves, but the visions they encounter inside of it horrify and traumatize the both of them for several days. Tigtone then declares that no mortal man should ever set foot inside the door... for free.

As he and Helpy marvel and delight in his newfound magical powers, Propecia prepares for its annual Wizard Hunt, during which an alignment of the land's many moons saps the land's magician community of its magical powers, rendering them mortal. Tigtone soon finds himself caught up in the middle of the hunt when his powers give out without warning, gravely injuring Helpy, who can no longer magically regenerate. Tigtone seeks refuge amongst a clan of wizards hiding out from the hunting parties, whose leader Crackers ([[Fred Willard]]) devises a plan to reroute all the magic sapped by Propecia's moons into the creation of a giant kaiju-like wizard. The giant wizard goes berserk and begins to destroy much of Propecia, during which Tigtone comes up with a new plan: Build a giant Tigtone to battle the wizard. With the assistance of the giant Tigtone the wizard is defeated, releasing all the collected magic back into Propecia's wizards, and into Helpy, who can now regenerate again.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=6\n| EpisodeNumber2=6\n| Title=...and the Freaks of Love\n| WrittenBy=Patricia Villetto\n| Aux2=Sean Glaze and Stanley Von Medvey\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|1|27}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= Tigtone and Helpy enthusiastically answer the call to quest for a coven of centaurs. Tigtone's excitement turns to disappointment when he learns that his task is to locate the legendary Fertile Centaur ([[John Waters]]) and escort him back to the coven before sundown. Tigtone agrees, but angrily makes his disdain for the quest known at every opportunity, escort quests being Tigtone's least favorite. He and Helpy locate the Fertile Centaur, but find him a nuisance who stubbornly refuses to travel, and is very nearly killed multiple times. After Tigtone searches inward, he realizes that all of his quests have indirectly been escort quests, and fully dedicates himself to completing his task, which moves the Fertile Centaur into cooperation, before promptly dying from an allergic reaction to a bee sting, forcing Tigtone and Helpy to cobble together a makeshift fake Fertile Centaur to present to the coven.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=7\n| EpisodeNumber2=7\n| Title=...and His Manless Match\n| WrittenBy=Andreas Trolf\n| Aux2=Frederic Cristy, Sean Glaze, and Stanley Von Medvey\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|2|3}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= In between quests, Tigtone happens upon Beconka ([[Cree Summer]]), who appears to be a gender-swapped equal to Tigtone.

After mercilessly competing with each other throughout the journey, Tigtone and Beconka eventually realize they will not be able to traverse the giant separately and team up, becoming soulmates along the way. Meanwhile Helpy stays behind at the tavern with Beconka's helper, Jacques, who lords over Helpy with his superior qualities, driving Helpy into depression and inferiority complex. Helpy turns the tables on Jacques however, murdering him brutally after learning Jacques does not have regenerative powers. After retrieving their quarry Tigtone and Helpy part ways with Beconka, mourning that in spite of their mutual love of questing they could never be together.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=8\n| EpisodeNumber2=8\n| Title=...and the Cemetery of the Dead\n| WrittenBy=Benjamin Martian\n| Aux2=Frederic Cristy, Sean Glaze, and Stanley Von Medvey\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|2|3}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= After being called to investigate a series of murders at a local campsite, Tigtone deduces that the only way to get the answers he seeks is to enter the land of the dead and interrogate the spirits of those that were killed. With the assistance of a temporary death potion, Tigtone enters the afterlife, and is initially confused by the terrified reaction he receives. A mysterious spirit ([[Paul Reubens]]) reveals to Tigtone's horror that he was responsible for the murders. Upon is revival from temporary death, Tigtone turns himself in to Propecia's authority to be tried and executed. Helpy, not convinced that Tigtone was responsible, decides to investigate. Helpy soon discovers that the murders were committed by the local groundskeeper C.J. ([[Blake Anderson]]), who had disguised himself as Tigtone to frame him at the orders of the mysterious spirit in the afterlife, revealed to be a serial killer whom Tigtone had brought to justice named Cryptomb. Before Tigtone can be executed, Helpy reveals the truth to Propecia. Enraged, Tigtone re-enters the afterlife temporarily and takes revenge on Cryptomb and C.J. for framing him.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=9\n| EpisodeNumber2=9\n| Title=...and the Singing Blade\n| WrittenBy=Benjamin Martian\n| Aux2=Mike Carlo, Sean Glaze, and Stanley Von Medvey\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|2|10}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= The story is told from the perspective of the talking, murderous Bard Sword ([[John DiMaggio]]), recounting the story of his encounter with Tigtone to King Queen and Tigtone himself in front of an active volcano. The Bard Sword sings a story of his discovery by a delinquent youth named Daker, who teams up with the talking blade to kill citizens of Propecia and take their armaments, to build a body made out of weapons (for more efficient killing purposes). Tigtone, angered that there are no more weapons to purchase, tracks the duo down, but is unable to fight them as he morally cannot kill a child. To get around this, Tigtone drinks a magic potion that transforms him into a youth, but only succeeds in irritating Helpy with childish behavior. The Bard Sword completes his body without Daker, who gradually gets bored and leaves. Before the Bard Sword can commit any more murders however, Helpy arrives to challenge the Bard Sword with Tigtone, who has now transformed himself into a sword. The Bard Sword is defeated, but Tigtone is unable to transform back as he only has enough potion to transform back into a child. Tigtone is transformed thusly, while Helpy raises him. Back in present day however, the Bard Sword is declared to be an unreliable narrator, and is tossed into the volcano.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=10\n| EpisodeNumber2=10\n| Title=...vs. Nothing\n| WrittenBy=Andrew Koehler\n| Aux2=Mike Carlo, Sean Glaze, and Stanley Von Medvey\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|2|10}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= Partway through a quest, Helpy reveals to Tigtone that they were on a quest of their own- to form a magical talisman known as the Jingis, which they had been doing over the course of the season with random trinkets found in each episode. Declaring that their life purpose was to help the greater good, Helpy takes the Jingis and disappears, but not before using it to bring the world into perfect balance and peacefulness. Tigtone soon finds himself restless and without direction, as there are no quests to be found in a peaceful world. In desperation, Tigtone calls upon the Crystal Gods for assistance, who reveal to him that the \"greater good\" that Helpy was assisting was actually a rogue god with the name The Greater Good ([[Jeffrey Combs]]). Determined to defeat him, Tigtone journeys to The Greater Good's ethereal realm, only to find that he has betrayed Helpy, and is now using him as a source of infinite life. Helpy implores Tigtone to kill them in order to sever their regenerative powers from The Greater Good, which Tigtone does with great hesitation and despair. Drained of regenerative abilities, The Greater Good is left vulnerable to Tigtone, who promptly kills him to avenge Helpy. In gratitude for killing The Greater Good, the Crystal Gods bring Helpy back to life, and the two of them leave with the Jingis. Once returned to Propecia, Tigtone uses the Jingis' power to create widespread chaos and havoc throughout the world, ensuring an endless supply of quests for the two of them.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n}}<!--Do not delete this line.

Helpy helps Tigtone kill Wadsor, with Tigtone deciding to keep Helpy as his companion.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=2\n| EpisodeNumber2=2\n| Title=...and the Beautiful War\n| WrittenBy=Andreas Trolf\n| Aux2=Frederic Cristy\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|1|13}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= A spreading plague of beauty has wracked the land of Propecia, and made it impossible for Lord Festus to do his job, working best in a brutal and hideous environment. He calls upon Tigtone to find the source of the beauty plague, (Which has already claimed Helpy, making him incredibly handsome) and put an end to it, to \"re-uglify\" the land. Their travels lead them to a kingdom of stunningly gorgeous unicorns residing above the clouds, who are locked in battle with each other to determine who is the most beautiful. Amidst the chaos of the battling unicorns, Tigtone meets an ugly unicorn named Zlotovf ([[Alan Oppenheimer]]), who explains that their bloodshed is what's causing the beauty plague in Tigtone's realm, and reveals another hidden world above the unicorn's, where a race of hideously ugly creatures reside. Tigtone and Helpy journey to this realm, and upon discovering that the creatures' tears reverse the unicorn's blood, Tigtone verbally abuses them until they cry an uglifying rain upon the land.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=3\n| EpisodeNumber2=3\n| Title=...and the Wine Crisis\n| WrittenBy=Andreas Trolf\n| Aux2=Sean Glaze and Stanley Von Medvey\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|1|20}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= A wine shortage has wracked Propecia, and several of the land's vineyards have gone missing, leaving the populace without much-desired wine to drink. King Queen tasks Tigtone with finding the cause of the wine shortage before it's too late. Tigtone and Helpy's travels lead them to an untouched vineyard, where they happily drink their fill of wine, only for the entire vineyard (along with the rest of Propecia's vineyards) to be uprooted by a band of sky pirates, lead by the vicious air pirate Zuviell ([[Grey Delisle]]). Tigtone fights Zuviell to a standstill, and he and Helpy are forced to retreat. Tigtone soon hatches a plan to rid themselves of the sky pirates, by turning Helpy into a vampire, and unleashing them upon the pirates in their slumber. They awaken in horror to discover their transformation, only for Tigtone to explain that they no longer crave wine, but blood instead. Upon realizing this, Zuviell declares they will no longer steal wine, and returns the stolen vineyards to Propecia, where they set to drinking the blood of its denizens.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=4\n| EpisodeNumber2=4\n| Title=...and Those Elemental Kings\n| WrittenBy=Andrew Koehler\n| Aux2=Frederic Cristy, Sean Glaze, and Stanley Von Medvey\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|1|20}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= Tigtone regales Helpy with a story of the time he discovered an enchanted doorway, which only could be opened with several symbols of power held by four elemental kings.

Helpy then asks what Tigtone discovered behind the doorway once he got it open, only for Tigtone to remember that he never opened the door after receiving the symbols. The two of them immediately head to the doorway's location to see for themselves, but the visions they encounter inside of it horrify and traumatize the both of them for several days. Tigtone then declares that no mortal man should ever set foot inside the door... for free.

Tigtone soon finds himself caught up in the middle of the hunt when his powers give out without warning, gravely injuring Helpy, who can no longer magically regenerate. Tigtone seeks refuge amongst a clan of wizards hiding out from the hunting parties, whose leader Crackers ([[Fred Willard]]) devises a plan to reroute all the magic sapped by Propecia's moons into the creation of a giant kaiju-like wizard. The giant wizard goes berserk and begins to destroy much of Propecia, during which Tigtone comes up with a new plan: Build a giant Tigtone to battle the wizard. With the assistance of the giant Tigtone the wizard is defeated, releasing all the collected magic back into Propecia's wizards, and into Helpy, who can now regenerate again.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=6\n| EpisodeNumber2=6\n| Title=...and the Freaks of Love\n| WrittenBy=Patricia Villetto\n| Aux2=Sean Glaze and Stanley Von Medvey\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|1|27}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= Tigtone and Helpy enthusiastically answer the call to quest for a coven of centaurs.

Tigtone agrees, but angrily makes his disdain for the quest known at every opportunity, escort quests being Tigtone's least favorite. He and Helpy locate the Fertile Centaur, but find him a nuisance who stubbornly refuses to travel, and is very nearly killed multiple times. After Tigtone searches inward, he realizes that all of his quests have indirectly been escort quests, and fully dedicates himself to completing his task, which moves the Fertile Centaur into cooperation, before promptly dying from an allergic reaction to a bee sting, forcing Tigtone and Helpy to cobble together a makeshift fake Fertile Centaur to present to the coven.\n| LineColor=564CA5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=7\n| EpisodeNumber2=7\n| Title=...and His Manless Match\n| WrittenBy=Andreas Trolf\n| Aux2=Frederic Cristy, Sean Glaze, and Stanley Von Medvey\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2019|2|3}}\n| ProdCode=\n| Viewers=\n| ShortSummary= In between quests, Tigtone happens upon Beconka ([[Cree Summer]]), who appears to be a gender-swapped equal to Tigtone.

After mercilessly competing with each other throughout the journey, Tigtone and Beconka eventually realize they will not be able to traverse the giant separately and team up, becoming soulmates along the way. Meanwhile Helpy stays behind at the tavern with Beconka's helper, Jacques, who lords over Helpy with his superior qualities, driving Helpy into depression and inferiority complex. Helpy turns the tables on Jacques however, murdering him brutally after learning Jacques does not have regenerative powers.

A mysterious spirit ([[Paul Reubens]]) reveals to Tigtone's horror that he was responsible for the murders. Upon is revival from temporary death, Tigtone turns himself in to Propecia's authority to be tried and executed. Helpy, not convinced that Tigtone was responsible, decides to investigate. Helpy soon discovers that the murders were committed by the local groundskeeper C.J. ([[Blake Anderson]]), who had disguised himself as Tigtone to frame him at the orders of the mysterious spirit in the afterlife, revealed to be a serial killer whom Tigtone had brought to justice named Cryptomb.

The Bard Sword sings a story of his discovery by a delinquent youth named Daker, who teams up with the talking blade to kill citizens of Propecia and take their armaments, to build a body made out of weapons (for more efficient killing purposes). Tigtone, angered that there are no more weapons to purchase, tracks the duo down, but is unable to fight them as he morally cannot kill a child. To get around this, Tigtone drinks a magic potion that transforms him into a youth, but only succeeds in irritating Helpy with childish behavior. The Bard Sword completes his body without Daker, who gradually gets bored and leaves. Before the Bard Sword can commit any more murders however, Helpy arrives to challenge the Bard Sword with Tigtone, who has now transformed himself into a sword. The Bard Sword is defeated, but Tigtone is unable to transform back as he only has enough potion to transform back into a child. Tigtone is transformed thusly, while Helpy raises him.

Tigtone soon finds himself restless and without direction, as there are no quests to be found in a peaceful world. In desperation, Tigtone calls upon the Crystal Gods for assistance, who reveal to him that the \"greater good\" that Helpy was assisting was actually a rogue god with the name The Greater Good ([[Jeffrey Combs]]). Determined to defeat him, Tigtone journeys to The Greater Good's ethereal realm, only to find that he has betrayed Helpy, and is now using him as a source of infinite life. Helpy implores Tigtone to kill them in order to sever their regenerative powers from The Greater Good, which Tigtone does with great hesitation and despair. Drained of regenerative abilities, The Greater Good is left vulnerable to Tigtone, who promptly kills him to avenge Helpy. In gratitude for killing The Greater Good, the Crystal Gods bring Helpy back to life, and the two of them leave with the Jingis.

Over a writing career of more than 50 years, he became one of the most prolific and popular authors of children's books in Welsh. He wrote, and was generally known, as '''T. Llew Jones'''.\n\n== Biography ==\nT. Llew Jones was born at 1 Bwlch Melyn, [[Penlan]], [[Swansea]]. Educated at ''ygg pont y brennin'', he was a primary school teacher in various schools in [[Ceredigion]] for 35 years before becoming a full-time writer, first at Tregroes Primary School and then at Ysgol Coedybryn near [[Llandysul]] where he became headmaster. He first came to prominence as a poet, winning the chair at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] in 1958 and then again in 1959.\n\nHe continued to write poetry, for children often, but was best known as a writer of adventure and detective novels for children. Many of these are historical novels based on the exploits of people such as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] and [[Twm Sion Cati]]. He published well over 50 books in total, including books for adults as well as children. Some of these are non-fiction titles, for example ''Ofnadwy Nos'' is an account of the wrecking of the [[Royal Charter (ship)|Royal Charter]]. Some of his books have been translated into English and a number have been adapted for television.\n\nHe was awarded an honorary MA degree by the [[University of Wales]] in 1977, and in 1991 he was awarded the [[Mary Vaughan Jones Award]], given for outstanding contributions to children's literature in Wales. In March 2005, aged nearly 90, he won the chair in Cymdeithas Ceredigion's annual Eisteddfod.\n\nJones died aged 93 on 9 January 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/welsh/hi/newsid_4120000/newsid_4129700/4129778.stm| title=Colli 'un o eiconau'r genedl'| work=BBC Cymru| language=Welsh| date=10 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nA new Welsh-medium primary school, Ysgol Gynradd Gymunedol T Llew Jones, in Brynhoffnant near Llangrannog, was named in his honour in 2012.

He was one of the small group of [[Welsh Chess Union]] members and officials who instigated and fought for the secession of the WCU from the [[British Chess Federation]] (as it then was) in 1970 and its successful application to join the World Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]) as an independent member.  As well as holding several posts in the WCU, Jones founded and edited ''Y Ddraig'' which grew from the Dyfed Chess Association newsletter into the magazine of Welsh chess in the 1970s. He managed the Men's [[21st Chess Olympiad|1974 Olympiad]] team in [[Nice]] which achieved Wales best-ever result and also the Women's team in the [[22nd Chess Olympiad|1976 Olympiad]] in Israel.

At his death he was Life President of the Dyfed Chess Association.  Over the board he was a keen and competitive player, but achieved his best results at postal chess, representing Welsh international teams with distinction.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n*1958 \u2013 Chair, Welsh National Eisteddfod, Ebbw Vale\n*1959 \u2013 Chair, Welsh National Eisteddfod, Caernarfon\n*1967 \u2013 [[Tir na n-Og Award]] for ''T\u00e2n ar y Comin''\n*1990 \u2013 Tir na n-Og Award for ''Lleuad yn Olau''\n*1991 \u2013 [[Mary Vaughan Jones Award]]\n*2007 \u2013 Welsh Publishing Awards, \"Best Seller \u2013 Poetry\", for ''Geiriau a Gerais''\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Books by T.

He wrote, and was generally known, as '''T. Llew Jones'''.\n\n== Biography ==\nT. Llew Jones was born at 1 Bwlch Melyn, [[Penlan]], [[Swansea]]. Educated at ''ygg pont y brennin'', he was a primary school teacher in various schools in [[Ceredigion]] for 35 years before becoming a full-time writer, first at Tregroes Primary School and then at Ysgol Coedybryn near [[Llandysul]] where he became headmaster. He first came to prominence as a poet, winning the chair at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] in 1958 and then again in 1959.\n\nHe continued to write poetry, for children often, but was best known as a writer of adventure and detective novels for children. Many of these are historical novels based on the exploits of people such as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] and [[Twm Sion Cati]]. He published well over 50 books in total, including books for adults as well as children. Some of these are non-fiction titles, for example ''Ofnadwy Nos'' is an account of the wrecking of the [[Royal Charter (ship)|Royal Charter]]. Some of his books have been translated into English and a number have been adapted for television.\n\nHe was awarded an honorary MA degree by the [[University of Wales]] in 1977, and in 1991 he was awarded the [[Mary Vaughan Jones Award]], given for outstanding contributions to children's literature in Wales. In March 2005, aged nearly 90, he won the chair in Cymdeithas Ceredigion's annual Eisteddfod.\n\nJones died aged 93 on 9 January 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/welsh/hi/newsid_4120000/newsid_4129700/4129778.stm| title=Colli 'un o eiconau'r genedl'| work=BBC Cymru| language=Welsh| date=10 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nA new Welsh-medium primary school, Ysgol Gynradd Gymunedol T Llew Jones, in Brynhoffnant near Llangrannog, was named in his honour in 2012.

He was one of the small group of [[Welsh Chess Union]] members and officials who instigated and fought for the secession of the WCU from the [[British Chess Federation]] (as it then was) in 1970 and its successful application to join the World Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]) as an independent member.  As well as holding several posts in the WCU, Jones founded and edited ''Y Ddraig'' which grew from the Dyfed Chess Association newsletter into the magazine of Welsh chess in the 1970s. He managed the Men's [[21st Chess Olympiad|1974 Olympiad]] team in [[Nice]] which achieved Wales best-ever result and also the Women's team in the [[22nd Chess Olympiad|1976 Olympiad]] in Israel.  He was for many years Vice-President of the WCU.\n\nJones was heavily involved in Dyfed chess from the 1960s onwards, in founding and running the Dyfed Chess Association, its league, Cardigan Chess Club and the highly successful Dyfed Open Congress. At his death he was Life President of the Dyfed Chess Association.  Over the board he was a keen and competitive player, but achieved his best results at postal chess, representing Welsh international teams with distinction.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n*1958 \u2013 Chair, Welsh National Eisteddfod, Ebbw Vale\n*1959 \u2013 Chair, Welsh National Eisteddfod, Caernarfon\n*1967 \u2013 [[Tir na n-Og Award]] for ''T\u00e2n ar y Comin''\n*1990 \u2013 Tir na n-Og Award for ''Lleuad yn Olau''\n*1991 \u2013 [[Mary Vaughan Jones Award]]\n*2007 \u2013 Welsh Publishing Awards, \"Best Seller \u2013 Poetry\", for ''Geiriau a Gerais''\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Books by T.

''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', which continues the story, was released six months after ''Reloaded'', in November 2003.\n\n==Plot==\nSix months after the events of ''[[The Matrix]]'', [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] and [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] are now romantically involved. [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] receives a message from Captain [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]] of the ''Logos'' calling an emergency meeting of all ships of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]]. Zion has confirmed [[The_Animatrix#Final Flight of the Osiris|the last transmission of the ''Osiris'']]: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Lock|Commander Lock]] orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain to contact the [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]]. As the ''Caduceus'' receives a message from the Oracle, one of the ''Caduceus'' crew, [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]], encounters [[Agent Smith|Smith]], who reveals that his previous encounter with Neo severed his connection with the Matrix and is now a rogue program, then absorbs his avatar. Smith then uses the phone line to leave the Matrix and gain control of Bane's real body.\n\nIn Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. In the Matrix, Neo meets the Oracle's bodyguard [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]], who leads him to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that this is his decision. The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix with the help of the [[Keymaker (The Matrix)|Keymaker]]. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted and is now a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the Matrix, including other Agents, as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo but fails, prompting a battle between Smith's clones and Neo. Neo manages to defend himself, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers.\n\nNeo, Morpheus, and Trinity visit the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]], who is imprisoning the Keymaker. The Merovingian, a rogue Matrix program with his own agenda, refuses to let him go. His wife [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]], seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity, leads the trio to the Keymaker. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker flee while Neo holds off the Merovingian's henchmen. Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker, pursued by several Agents and the Merovingian's chief henchmen, [[Twins (The Matrix)|the Twins]]. After a long chase, Trinity escapes, Morpheus defeats the Twins, and Neo saves Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agent Johnson.\n\nThe crews of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', ''Vigilant'', and ''Logos'' help the Keymaker and Neo reach the Source. The ''Logos'' crew must destroy a power plant and the ''Vigilant'' crew must disable a back-up power station, to prevent a security system from being triggered, allowing Neo to open the door to the Source. Haunted by a vision of Trinity's death, Neo asks her to remain on the ''Nebuchadnezzar''.\n\nThe ''Logos'' succeeds, while the ''Vigilant'' is destroyed by a Sentinel, killing everyone on board. Trinity replaces the ''Vigilant'' crew and completes their mission. However, Agent Thompson corners her and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus, and the Keymaker try to reach the Source, the Smiths ambush them. The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source, but the Smiths shoot him dead as he closes the door.\n\nNeo meets a program called the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]], the creator of the Matrix. The Architect explains that Neo is himself a program and an intentional part of the Matrix, which is now in its sixth iteration. Neo is meant to stop the Matrix's fatal system crash that naturally recurs due to the concept of human choice within it. As with the five previous Ones, Neo has a choice: either return to the Source to reboot the Matrix and pick survivors to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion, as his predecessors all did, or cause the Matrix to crash and kill everyone connected to it, which would mean humanity's extinction when Zion is destroyed. Neo learns of Trinity's situation and chooses to save her instead of returning to the Source, to which the Architect responds dismissively.\n\nTrinity is shot as she and Agent Thompson fall off a building. Before she hits the ground, Neo catches her. He then removes the bullet from her heart and revives her. They return to the real world, where Sentinels attack them. The ''Nebuchadnezzar'' is destroyed, but the crew escape. Neo displays a new ability to disable the machines with his thoughts, but falls into a coma from the effort.

The [[freeway]] chase and \"Burly Brawl\" scenes were filmed at the decommissioned [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] in [[Alameda, California]]. The producers constructed a 1.5-mile freeway on the old runways specifically for the film. Some portions of the chase were also filmed in [[Oakland, California]], and the tunnel shown briefly is the [[Webster Tube]], which connects Oakland and Alameda. Some post-production editing was also done in old aircraft hangars on the base. The city of [[Akron, Ohio]] was willing to give full access to [[Ohio State Route 59|Route 59]], the stretch of freeway known as the \"Innerbelt\", for filming of the freeway chase when it was under consideration.

To develop technologies for the film, Warner Bros. launched ESC Entertainment.<ref name=\"Wired VFX\" >{{cite magazine | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html | title=Matrix<sup>2</sup> | magazine=Wired | accessdate=December 25, 2012 | author=Silberman, Steve}}</ref> The ESC team tried to figure out how to bring the Wachowskis' vision to the screen, but because bullet time required arrays of carefully aligned cameras and months of planning, even for a brief scene featuring two or three actors, a scene like the Burly Brawl seemed almost impossible as envisioned and could take years to composite. Eventually [[John Gaeta]] realized that the technology he and his crew had developed for ''The Matrix''{{'}}s [[bullet time]] was no longer sufficient and concluded they needed a [[virtuality|virtual]] [[camera]] (in other words, a [[simulation]] of a camera). Having before used real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models in ''The Matrix'', the team started digitizing all data, such as scenes, characters' motions, or even the reflectivity of Neo's [[cassock]]. The [[reflection (computer graphics)|reflectivity]] of objects needs to be [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|captured and simulated adequately]] and [[Paul Debevec]] et al. captured the reflectance of the [[human face]] and Borshukov's work was strongly based on the findings of Debevec et al. They developed \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution, then capture expressions from Reeves and Weaving using [[Motion capture#Markerless|dense aka. markerless capture]] and [[multi-camera setup]] (similar to the bullet time rig) [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] capture [[Art techniques and materials|technique]] called [[optical flow]].<ref name=\"Deb2005\">{{cite book | last = Debevec | first = Paul | authorlink = |author2=J.

With this collected wealth of data and the right algorithms, they finally were able to create [[virtual cinematography]] in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras, years of compositing data, and replacing the use of still camera arrays or, in some scenes, cameras altogether. The ESC team rendered the final effects using the program [[mental ray]].<ref name=\"Wired VFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|The Matrix Reloaded: The Album|The Matrix Reloaded (score)}}\n[[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], who composed for ''The Matrix'', returned to score ''Reloaded''. For many of the pivotal action sequences, such as the \"Burly Brawl\", he collaborated with [[Juno Reactor]]. Some of the collaborative cues by Davis and Juno Reactor are extensions of material by Juno Reactor; for example, a version of \"Komit\" featuring Davis' strings is used during a flying sequence, and \"Burly Brawl\" is essentially a combination of Davis' unused \"Multiple Replication\" and a piece similar to Juno Reactor's \"Masters of the Universe\". One of the collaborations, \"[[Mona Lisa Overdrive (song)|Mona Lisa Overdrive]]\", is titled in reference to the [[cyberpunk]] [[Mona Lisa Overdrive|novel of the same name]] by [[William Gibson]], a major influence on the directors.\n\n[[Leitmotif]]s established in ''The Matrix'' return \u2014 such as the Matrix main theme, Neo and Trinity's love theme, the Sentinel's theme, Neo's flying theme, and a more frequent use of the four-note Agent Smith theme \u2014 and others used in ''Revolutions'' are established.\n\nAs with its predecessor, many tracks by external musicians are featured in the movie, its closing credits, and the soundtrack album, some of which were written for the film. Many of the musicians featured, for example [[Rob Zombie]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], had also appeared on the soundtrack for ''The Matrix''. [[Rob Dougan]] also re-contributed, licensing the instrumental version of \"[[Furious Angels]]\", as well as being commissioned to provide an original track, ultimately scoring the battle in the Merovingian's chateau. A remixed version of \"[[Slap It (Fluke song)|Slap It]]\" by electronic artist [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]] \u2014 listed on the soundtrack as \"Zion\" \u2014 was used during the rave scene.\n\n[[Linkin Park]] contributed their instrumental song \"Session\" to the film as well, although it did not appear during the course of the film. [[P.O.D.]] composed a song called \"[[Sleeping Awake]]\", with a [[music video]] which focused heavily on Neo, as well as many images that were part of the film.

Smith then uses the phone line to leave the Matrix and gain control of Bane's real body.\n\nIn Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. In the Matrix, Neo meets the Oracle's bodyguard [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]], who leads him to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that this is his decision. The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix with the help of the [[Keymaker (The Matrix)|Keymaker]]. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted and is now a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the Matrix, including other Agents, as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo but fails, prompting a battle between Smith's clones and Neo. Neo manages to defend himself, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers.\n\nNeo, Morpheus, and Trinity visit the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]], who is imprisoning the Keymaker. The Merovingian, a rogue Matrix program with his own agenda, refuses to let him go. His wife [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]], seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity, leads the trio to the Keymaker. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker flee while Neo holds off the Merovingian's henchmen. Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker, pursued by several Agents and the Merovingian's chief henchmen, [[Twins (The Matrix)|the Twins]]. After a long chase, Trinity escapes, Morpheus defeats the Twins, and Neo saves Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agent Johnson.\n\nThe crews of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', ''Vigilant'', and ''Logos'' help the Keymaker and Neo reach the Source. The ''Logos'' crew must destroy a power plant and the ''Vigilant'' crew must disable a back-up power station, to prevent a security system from being triggered, allowing Neo to open the door to the Source. Haunted by a vision of Trinity's death, Neo asks her to remain on the ''Nebuchadnezzar''.\n\nThe ''Logos'' succeeds, while the ''Vigilant'' is destroyed by a Sentinel, killing everyone on board. Trinity replaces the ''Vigilant'' crew and completes their mission. However, Agent Thompson corners her and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus, and the Keymaker try to reach the Source, the Smiths ambush them. The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source, but the Smiths shoot him dead as he closes the door.\n\nNeo meets a program called the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]], the creator of the Matrix. The Architect explains that Neo is himself a program and an intentional part of the Matrix, which is now in its sixth iteration. Neo is meant to stop the Matrix's fatal system crash that naturally recurs due to the concept of human choice within it. As with the five previous Ones, Neo has a choice: either return to the Source to reboot the Matrix and pick survivors to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion, as his predecessors all did, or cause the Matrix to crash and kill everyone connected to it, which would mean humanity's extinction when Zion is destroyed. Neo learns of Trinity's situation and chooses to save her instead of returning to the Source, to which the Architect responds dismissively.\n\nTrinity is shot as she and Agent Thompson fall off a building. Before she hits the ground, Neo catches her. He then removes the bullet from her heart and revives her. They return to the real world, where Sentinels attack them. The ''Nebuchadnezzar'' is destroyed, but the crew escape. Neo displays a new ability to disable the machines with his thoughts, but falls into a coma from the effort. The crew are picked up by another ship, the ''Hammer''. Its captain, Roland, reveals the other ships were wiped out by the machines after someone activated an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] too early, and that they found only one survivor: the Smith-possessed Bane.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[Agent Smith]]\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]]\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Link\n* [[Randall Duk Kim]] as [[Keymaker|The Keymaker]]\n* [[Gloria Foster]] as [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]]\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]]\n* [[Lambert Wilson]] as The Merovingian\n* [[Helmut Bakaitis]] as [[Architect (The Matrix)|The Architect]]\n* Neil and Adrian Rayment as [[Twins (The Matrix)|Twins]]\n* [[Daniel Bernhardt]] as Agent Johnson\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Axel\n* [[Collin Chou]] as [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]]\n* [[Nona Gaye]] as Zee\n* [[Gina Torres]] as Cas\n* Donald Anjaya Batte as Vector\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Councillor Hamann\n* [[Roy Jones Jr.]] as Captain Ballard\n* David A.

The [[freeway]] chase and \"Burly Brawl\" scenes were filmed at the decommissioned [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] in [[Alameda, California]]. The producers constructed a 1.5-mile freeway on the old runways specifically for the film. Some portions of the chase were also filmed in [[Oakland, California]], and the tunnel shown briefly is the [[Webster Tube]], which connects Oakland and Alameda. Some post-production editing was also done in old aircraft hangars on the base. The city of [[Akron, Ohio]] was willing to give full access to [[Ohio State Route 59|Route 59]], the stretch of freeway known as the \"Innerbelt\", for filming of the freeway chase when it was under consideration.

To develop technologies for the film, Warner Bros. launched ESC Entertainment.<ref name=\"Wired VFX\" >{{cite magazine | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html | title=Matrix<sup>2</sup> | magazine=Wired | accessdate=December 25, 2012 | author=Silberman, Steve}}</ref> The ESC team tried to figure out how to bring the Wachowskis' vision to the screen, but because bullet time required arrays of carefully aligned cameras and months of planning, even for a brief scene featuring two or three actors, a scene like the Burly Brawl seemed almost impossible as envisioned and could take years to composite. Eventually [[John Gaeta]] realized that the technology he and his crew had developed for ''The Matrix''{{'}}s [[bullet time]] was no longer sufficient and concluded they needed a [[virtuality|virtual]] [[camera]] (in other words, a [[simulation]] of a camera). Having before used real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models in ''The Matrix'', the team started digitizing all data, such as scenes, characters' motions, or even the reflectivity of Neo's [[cassock]]. The [[reflection (computer graphics)|reflectivity]] of objects needs to be [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|captured and simulated adequately]] and [[Paul Debevec]] et al. captured the reflectance of the [[human face]] and Borshukov's work was strongly based on the findings of Debevec et al. They developed \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution, then capture expressions from Reeves and Weaving using [[Motion capture#Markerless|dense aka. markerless capture]] and [[multi-camera setup]] (similar to the bullet time rig) [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] capture [[Art techniques and materials|technique]] called [[optical flow]].<ref name=\"Deb2005\">{{cite book | last = Debevec | first = Paul | authorlink = |author2=J.

With this collected wealth of data and the right algorithms, they finally were able to create [[virtual cinematography]] in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras, years of compositing data, and replacing the use of still camera arrays or, in some scenes, cameras altogether.

For many of the pivotal action sequences, such as the \"Burly Brawl\", he collaborated with [[Juno Reactor]]. Some of the collaborative cues by Davis and Juno Reactor are extensions of material by Juno Reactor; for example, a version of \"Komit\" featuring Davis' strings is used during a flying sequence, and \"Burly Brawl\" is essentially a combination of Davis' unused \"Multiple Replication\" and a piece similar to Juno Reactor's \"Masters of the Universe\". One of the collaborations, \"[[Mona Lisa Overdrive (song)|Mona Lisa Overdrive]]\", is titled in reference to the [[cyberpunk]] [[Mona Lisa Overdrive|novel of the same name]] by [[William Gibson]], a major influence on the directors.\n\n[[Leitmotif]]s established in ''The Matrix'' return \u2014 such as the Matrix main theme, Neo and Trinity's love theme, the Sentinel's theme, Neo's flying theme, and a more frequent use of the four-note Agent Smith theme \u2014 and others used in ''Revolutions'' are established.\n\nAs with its predecessor, many tracks by external musicians are featured in the movie, its closing credits, and the soundtrack album, some of which were written for the film. Many of the musicians featured, for example [[Rob Zombie]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], had also appeared on the soundtrack for ''The Matrix''. [[Rob Dougan]] also re-contributed, licensing the instrumental version of \"[[Furious Angels]]\", as well as being commissioned to provide an original track, ultimately scoring the battle in the Merovingian's chateau. A remixed version of \"[[Slap It (Fluke song)|Slap It]]\" by electronic artist [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]] \u2014 listed on the soundtrack as \"Zion\" \u2014 was used during the rave scene.\n\n[[Linkin Park]] contributed their instrumental song \"Session\" to the film as well, although it did not appear during the course of the film. [[P.O.D.]] composed a song called \"[[Sleeping Awake]]\", with a [[music video]] which focused heavily on Neo, as well as many images that were part of the film. Both songs played during the film's credits.\n\nIt was originally planned for the electronic band [[R\u00f6yksopp]] to create the soundtrack, but this offer was turned down.<ref>\"[http://www.fib.no/en/News-2015/Kafka-feat-Royksopp-at-the-Bergen-International-Festival/ Kafka feat.
