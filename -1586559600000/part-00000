Ikastolak can be nowadays either private or public, divided into different networks.\n\nThe Basque language public network relies on state funding and management, allocated in Spain by the education institutions of the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre in their corresponding territories, while in France the association Ikas-Bi in the public network advocates for bilingual education. Seaska is the private network of Basque language schools in the French Basque Country, closely linked to the similar network in the [[Southern Basque Country]]. The private networks base their activity on the fees paid by parents, popular subscription (either directly or by means of annual massive festivals, e.g. ''[[Herri Urrats]]'', ''[[Nafarroa Oinez]]'', ''[[Araba Euskaraz]]'', etc.) and the allowance provided by public educational institutions.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sanpelaio4.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Salbatore Mitxelena ikastola of [[Zarautz]]]]\nAlthough spoken more widely than in later times, there was very little schooling undertaken in Basque before the early 20th century revival in [[Basque nationalism]]. Spanish and French were mandatory in schooling at either side of the border. The first official ikastola was opened in 1914, and the movement to transfer the medium of education in the [[Southern Basque Country]] from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to Basque became widespread in the late 20th century. \n\nDuring the early 1930s, the seeds of the \"Basque Schools\" (''Escuelas Vascas'') were sown  in [[Navarre]] by the Basque Nationalist Party, featuring an instruction where the teachings of the Christian doctrine were central. They were conceived as an attempt to counter increased laicization of state schools and the lack of focus (\"the neutrality\") on Basque matters in regular religious schooling. The first such educative institution was founded in November 1931 at Pamplona, followed by another one in [[Estella-Lizarra]] (1933) and Elizondo (1935).<ref>{{cite book |last=Dronda |first=Javier |date=2013 |title=Con Cristo o contra Cristo: Religi\u00f3n y movilizaci\u00f3n antirrepublicana en Navarra (1931-1936)|url= |location=Tafalla |publisher=Txalaparta |page=300 |isbn=978-84-15313-31-1 |accessdate= }}</ref>   \n\nFollowing the Republican defeat in the [[Spanish Civil War]], the public use of [[Basque language|Basque]] was [[Language politics in Spain under Franco|made illegal]], and all educational institutions were forced to teach entirely through the medium of [[Spanish language|Castilian]], to the complete neglect and persecution of Basque. There are, however, isolated examples of ikastolak which clandestinely continued to teach in Basque. \n\nSince thousands of children were studying out of the authorized schools and hence forbidden to progress to higher education, in 1969 the Roman Catholic Church arranged with the parent associations the lawful Diocesan Federation of Ikastolas, later becoming a secular federation. With the return of democracy following the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in 1975, large degrees of self-government were given to the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and [[Navarre]], and ikastolak sprang up all over the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque region]] in northern [[Spain]].\n\nFor a time, the ikastolak operated along the public school system, the private schools publicly funded under a charter and the private schools. During his term as Basque minister for education, the [[Partido Socialista de Euskadi|Socialist]] [[Fernando Buesa]] proposed the 1993 Law of the Basque Public School, prompting ikastolak to choose between full integration in the public system or operating under the rules for chartered private schools.\n\nAt the present time, tens of thousands of schoolchildren in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and [[Navarre]] attend ikastolak, but the status of ikastolak differs greatly depending on their location. They are firmly entrenched in the traditionally Basque-speaking areas of the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC), but less so in non-Basque speaking areas (i.e. the southern fringes). Basque language schools in the north of Navarre do not enjoy the same support from the regional government as they do in the BAC, but they are officially recognised and enjoy widespread local support (traditionally Basque speaking), unlike central and southern areas of Navarre, where they lack public recognition and funding, remaining in a legal limbo until 2007.\n\nIn the French Basque Country, the ikastolak developed later, but grew steadily, so much so that a network, [[Seaska]], is now widespread throughout the whole territory covering education up to the A levels.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Basque education system]]\n* [[Breton language]] [[Diwan schools]]\n* [[Euskal Herriak Bere Eskola]]\n* [[Irish language]] [[Gaelscoil]]eana\n* [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[Welsh medium education]]\n* [[Scottish Gaelic]] [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland|Gaelic medium education]]\n* [[Catalan language]] [[La Bressola]]\n* [[Occitan language]] [[Calandreta]]s\n* Illegal [[German language]] [[Katakombenschule]] in Italian Tyrol.\n* [[Greek language]] [[Krifo scholio]] during the Ottoman occupation\n* [[Galician language]] [[A gali\u00f1a azul]] in [[Galiza]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat|Ikastolak|lcfirst=yes}}\nOfficial site of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203130928/http://www.ikastola.net/web/default.php Federation of Ikastolak] (Basque)\n\n[[Category:Basque culture]]\n[[Category:Education in Spain]]\n[[Category:Education in France]]\n[[Category:Minority schools]]\n[[Category:Education in the Basque Country]]\n", "text_old": "An '''Ikastola''' ({{IPA-eu|ikas\u033atola}}, plural ''ikastolak'') is a type of primary and secondary school in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]], [[Navarre]] and (to a much lesser extent) the [[French Basque Country]] (see [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]) in which pupils are taught either entirely or predominantly in the [[Basque language]].

The private networks base their activity on the fees paid by parents, popular subscription (either directly or by means of annual massive festivals, e.g. ''[[Herri Urrats]], [[Nafarroa Oinez]], [[Araba Euskaraz]]'', etc.) and the allowance provided by public educational institutions.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sanpelaio4.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Salbatore Mitxelena ikastola of [[Zarautz]]]]\nAlthough spoken more widely than in later times, there was very little schooling undertaken in Basque before the early 20th century revival in [[Basque nationalism]]. Spanish and French were mandatory in schooling at either side of the border. The first official ikastola was opened in 1914, and the movement to transfer the medium of education in the [[Southern Basque Country]] from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to Basque became widespread in the late 20th century. \n\nDuring the early 1930s, the seeds of the \"Basque Schools\" (''Escuelas Vascas'') were sown  in [[Navarre]] by the Basque Nationalist Party, featuring an instruction where the teachings of the Christian doctrine were central. They were conceived as an attempt to counter increased laicization of state schools and the lack of focus (\"the neutrality\") on Basque matters in regular religious schooling. The first such educative institution was founded in November 1931 at Pamplona, followed by another one in [[Estella-Lizarra]] (1933) and Elizondo (1935).<ref>{{cite book |last=Dronda |first=Javier |date=2013 |title=Con Cristo o contra Cristo: Religi\u00f3n y movilizaci\u00f3n antirrepublicana en Navarra (1931-1936)|url= |location=Tafalla |publisher=Txalaparta |page=300 |isbn=978-84-15313-31-1 |accessdate= }}</ref>   \n\nFollowing the Republican defeat in the [[Spanish Civil War]], the public use of [[Basque language|Basque]] was [[Language politics in Spain under Franco|made illegal]], and all educational institutions were forced to teach entirely through the medium of [[Spanish language|Castilian]], to the complete neglect and persecution of Basque. There are, however, isolated examples of ikastolak which clandestinely continued to teach in Basque. \n\nSince thousands of children were studying out of the authorized schools and hence forbidden to progress to higher education, in 1969 the Roman Catholic Church arranged with the parent associations the lawful Diocesan Federation of Ikastolas, later becoming a secular federation. With the return of democracy following the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in 1975, large degrees of self-government were given to the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and [[Navarre]], and ikastolak sprang up all over the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque region]] in northern [[Spain]].\n\nFor a time, the ikastolak operated along the public school system, the private schools publicly funded under a charter and the private schools. During his term as Basque minister for education, the [[Partido Socialista de Euskadi|Socialist]] [[Fernando Buesa]] proposed the 1993 Law of the Basque Public School, prompting ikastolak to choose between full integration in the public system or operating under the rules for chartered private schools.\n\nAt the present time, tens of thousands of schoolchildren in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and [[Navarre]] attend ikastolak, but the status of ikastolak differs greatly depending on their location. They are firmly entrenched in the traditionally Basque-speaking areas of the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC), but less so in non-Basque speaking areas (i.e. the southern fringes). Basque language schools in the north of Navarre do not enjoy the same support from the regional government as they do in the BAC, but they are officially recognised and enjoy widespread local support (traditionally Basque speaking), unlike central and southern areas of Navarre, where they lack public recognition and funding, remaining in a legal limbo until 2007.\n\nIn the French Basque Country, the ikastolak developed later, but grew steadily, so much so that a network, [[Seaska]], is now widespread throughout the whole territory covering education up to the A levels.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Basque education system]]\n* [[Breton language]] [[Diwan schools]]\n* [[Euskal Herriak Bere Eskola]]\n* [[Irish language]] [[Gaelscoil]]eana\n* [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[Welsh medium education]]\n* [[Scottish Gaelic]] [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland|Gaelic medium education]]\n* [[Catalan language]] [[La Bressola]]\n* [[Occitan language]] [[Calandreta]]s\n* Illegal [[German language]] [[Katakombenschule]] in Italian Tyrol.\n* [[Greek language]] [[Krifo scholio]] during the Ottoman occupation\n* [[Galician language]] [[A gali\u00f1a azul]] in [[Galiza]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat|Ikastolak|lcfirst=yes}}\nOfficial site of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203130928/http://www.ikastola.net/web/default.php Federation of Ikastolak] (Basque)\n\n[[Category:Basque culture]]\n[[Category:Education in Spain]]\n[[Category:Education in France]]\n[[Category:Minority schools]]\n[[Category:Education in the Basque Country]]\n", "name_user": "OwenBlacker", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Language tagging", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikastola"}

The screenplay was written by [[Dan Sterling]], based on a story he co-wrote with Rogen and Goldberg. The film stars Rogen and [[James Franco]] as journalists who set up an interview with [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] ([[Randall Park]]), and are then recruited by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to assassinate him. The film is heavily inspired by a 2012 ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' documentary.\n\nRogen and Goldberg developed the idea for ''The Interview'' in the late 2000s, with [[Kim Jong-il]] as the original assassination target. In 2011, after [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|Jong-il's death]] and Jong-un's succession as the [[List of heads of state of North Korea|North Korean leader]], Rogen and Goldberg redeveloped the script with the focus on Jong-un's character. ''The Interview'' was first announced in March 2013, at the beginning of pre-production. [[Principal photography]] was in [[Vancouver]] from October to December 2013. The film was produced by [[Columbia Pictures]], [[LStar Capital]] and Rogen and Goldberg's [[Point Grey Pictures]], and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]].\n\nIn June 2014, the North Korean government threatened action against the United States if Sony released the film. As a result, Sony delayed the release from October to December and reportedly re-edited the film to make it more acceptable to North Korea. In November, the computer systems of Sony were [[Sony Pictures hack|hacked]] by the \"Guardians of Peace\", a group the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] claimed has ties to North Korea.<ref>[[Gabi Siboni]] and David Siman-Tov, [http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20646%20-%20Gabi%20and%20Dudi%20for%20web.pdf Cyberspace Extortion: North Korea versus the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820031432/http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20646%20-%20Gabi%20and%20Dudi%20for%20web.pdf |date=August 20, 2016 }}, [[Institute for National Security Studies (Israel)|INSS]] Insight No. 646, December 23, 2014.</ref> The group also threatened terrorist attacks against theaters showing the film. As a result, major theater chains opted not to release the film, and Sony instead released it for online digital rental and purchase on December 24, 2014, followed by a [[limited release]] at selected theaters the next day.\n\nIn December 2014, [[South Korea|South Korean]] singer [[Yoon Mi-rae]] revealed that the film used her song \"Pay Day\" without permission, and that she was taking legal action.<ref name=\"newsmp\">{{cite news|url=http://www.soompi.com/2014/12/26/yoon-mi-rae-to-take-legal-action-against-sony-pictures-for-using-her-song-in-the-interview-without-permission/|title=Yoon Mi Rae to Take Legal Action against Sony Pictures for Using Her Song in \"The Interview\" without Permission|date=27 December 2014|work=Soompi|author=|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref> Yoon Mi-rae and her label [[Feel Ghood Music]] reached a settlement with Sony Pictures Entertainment on the 13th of May 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/201343/20150517/sony-the-interview-yoon-mi-rae-payday.htm|title=Sony And Yoon Mi Rae Reach Settlement Over Unlicensed Song Usage In 'The Interview'|website=KpopStarz|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> \n\n''The Interview'' grossed $40 million in digital rentals, making it Sony's most successful digital release and earned an additional $12.3 million worldwide in box office ticket sales on a $44 million budget. It received mixed reviews for its humor and subject matter, although a few critics praised the performances of Rogen, Franco, Park and [[Diana Bang]].\n\n==Plot==\nDave Skylark is the host of the [[talk show]] ''Skylark Tonight'', where he interviews various celebrities about personal topics and gossip. After Skylark and his crew celebrate their producer Aaron Rapaport's 1,000th episode, Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticized the show as not being a real news program. Rapaport reveals his concern and urge for change, to which Skylark agrees. Later, Skylark discovers that [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] is a fan of ''Skylark Tonight'', prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview for him. Rapaport travels to a place outside [[Dandong]], [[China]] to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, the [[Propaganda in North Korea|North Korean chief propagandist]], and Rapaport accepts the task of interviewing Kim on behalf of Skylark.\n\nThe next day, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Lacey shows up at Skylark and Rapaport's place, proposing that the duo assassinate Kim using a [[Transdermal patch|transdermal strip]] that will expose Kim to [[ricin]] via handshake; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the ricin strip hidden inside a pack of gum. Upon their arrival in the [[Residences of North Korean leaders|presidential palace]] in [[Pyongyang]], they are introduced to security officers Koh and Yu; Koh discovers the strip and chews it, believing it to be gum. That night, Lacey airdrops them two more strips from a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], but in order to smuggle it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a [[Siberian tiger]] and then hide the container in his rectum. Later, Kim shows up and introduces himself to Skylark.\n\nSkylark spends the day with Kim by playing [[basketball]], hanging out and partying together. Kim persuades Skylark that he is misunderstood as both a cruel dictator and a failed administrator, and they become friends. At dinner, Koh has a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] due to the ricin poisoning and accidentally shoots Yu before dying. The next morning, Skylark feels guilty and discards one of the ricin strips, then thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After another dinner mourning the death of Kim's bodyguards, Skylark witnesses Kim's malicious side as he [[Korean conflict|threatens war]] against [[South Korea]] and \"every single enemy of his country\". Skylark leaves and after taking a walk, he discovers that a nearby grocery store is merely [[Potemkin village|fake]] and realizes that Kim has been lying to him. At the same time, during an attempted sex with Rapaport (who still has the ricin strip in his hand), Sook-yin reveals that she despises Kim and apologizes for defending the regime. Skylark, Rapaport and Sook-yin plan to ruin [[Kim Jong-un's cult of personality|Kim's cult of personality]] by causing him to cry on air. Before the broadcast starts, Kim gives Skylark a puppy as a gift to keep.\n\nDuring the internationally televised interview with Kim, Skylark addresses increasingly sensitive topics (including the country's [[North Korean famine|food shortage]] issues and [[Sanctions against North Korea|economic sanctions]] imposed by the US) and challenges Kim's need for [[Kim Jong-il|his father]]'s approval. Meanwhile, Sook-yin and Rapaport seize control of the broadcasting center and attack guards trying to cut off the broadcast. Despite his initial resistance, Kim eventually cries uncontrollably and soils himself after Skylark sings [[Firework (song)|\"Firework\"]] by [[Katy Perry]] (having learned of Kim's fondness of Perry earlier), ruining his reputation. Feeling betrayed and labeling Skylark as a \"fake friend\", Kim shoots him and leaves, but Skylark survives due to a [[bulletproof vest]]. Skylark, Rapaport and Sook-yin regroup (with the puppy in tow) and escape the presidential palace with the unexpected help of a panel-control guard. The trio hijack Kim's [[T-54/T-55|personal tank]], originally given to [[Kim Il-sung]] by [[Joseph Stalin]], to get to their pickup point. Kim boards a helicopter while his own army attacks the group. He prepares a nuclear missile launch, but before he can issue the command to launch, Skylark shoots down Kim's helicopter, killing him. \n\nWith the immediate threat over, Sook guides Skylark and Rapaport to an escape route where they are rescued and loaded onto a rescue craft by three [[SEAL Team Six]] members disguised as [[Korean People's Army]] troops, while Sook goes to [[Pyongyang]] to ensure political stability. Back in the United States, Skylark writes a book about his experience while North Korea become [[denuclearization|denuclearized]] and [[democratization|democratized]] under Sook-yin, who steps in as an [[Transitional government|interim]] leader.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Franco]] as Dave Skylark\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Aaron Rapaport\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Agent Lacey\n* [[Randall Park]] as [[Kim Jong-un]]\n* [[Diana Bang]] as Sook-yin Park\n* [[Timothy Simons]] as Malcolm\n<!-- these are listed after the main six in the longer closing credits -->\n* Reese Alexander as Agent Botwin\n* [[Anders Holm]] as Jake\n* [[Charles Chun|Charles Rahi Chun]] as General Jong\n* [[Ben Schwartz]] as Daryl\n<!-- ones listed after here were minor characters such as Two-Fingered Man, Train Passengers, Korean Girl, Hot Korean Girls, Drone Pilot, etc. -->\n\nThe film also features [[cameo appearance]]s from [[Eminem]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Bill Maher]], [[Seth Meyers]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Brian Williams]] and [[Scott Pelley]].

The screenplay was written by [[Dan Sterling]], based on a story he co-wrote with Rogen and Goldberg. The film stars Rogen and [[James Franco]] as journalists who set up an interview with [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] ([[Randall Park]]), and are then recruited by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to assassinate him. The film is heavily inspired by a 2012 ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' documentary.\n\nRogen and Goldberg developed the idea for ''The Interview'' in the late 2000s, with [[Kim Jong-il]] as the original assassination target. In 2011, after [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|Jong-il's death]] and Jong-un's succession as the [[List of heads of state of North Korea|North Korean leader]], Rogen and Goldberg redeveloped the script with the focus on Jong-un's character. ''The Interview'' was first announced in March 2013, at the beginning of pre-production. [[Principal photography]] was in [[Vancouver]] from October to December 2013. The film was produced by [[Columbia Pictures]], [[LStar Capital]] and Rogen and Goldberg's [[Point Grey Pictures]], and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]].\n\nIn June 2014, the North Korean government threatened action against the United States if Sony released the film. As a result, Sony delayed the release from October to December and reportedly re-edited the film to make it more acceptable to North Korea. In November, the computer systems of Sony were [[Sony Pictures hack|hacked]] by the \"Guardians of Peace\", a group the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] claimed has ties to North Korea.<ref>[[Gabi Siboni]] and David Siman-Tov, [http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20646%20-%20Gabi%20and%20Dudi%20for%20web.pdf Cyberspace Extortion: North Korea versus the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820031432/http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20646%20-%20Gabi%20and%20Dudi%20for%20web.pdf |date=August 20, 2016 }}, [[Institute for National Security Studies (Israel)|INSS]] Insight No. 646, December 23, 2014.</ref> The group also threatened terrorist attacks against theaters showing the film. As a result, major theater chains opted not to release the film, and Sony instead released it for online digital rental and purchase on December 24, 2014, followed by a [[limited release]] at selected theaters the next day.\n\nIn December 2014, [[South Korea|South Korean]] singer [[Yoon Mi-rae]] revealed that the film used her song \"Pay Day\" without permission, and that she was taking legal action.<ref name=\"newsmp\">{{cite news|url=http://www.soompi.com/2014/12/26/yoon-mi-rae-to-take-legal-action-against-sony-pictures-for-using-her-song-in-the-interview-without-permission/|title=Yoon Mi Rae to Take Legal Action against Sony Pictures for Using Her Song in \"The Interview\" without Permission|date=27 December 2014|work=Soompi|author=|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref> Yoon Mi-rae and her label [[Feel Ghood Music]] reached a settlement with Sony Pictures Entertainment on the 13th of May 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/201343/20150517/sony-the-interview-yoon-mi-rae-payday.htm|title=Sony And Yoon Mi Rae Reach Settlement Over Unlicensed Song Usage In 'The Interview'|website=KpopStarz|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> \n\n''The Interview'' grossed $40 million in digital rentals, making it Sony's most successful digital release and earned an additional $12.3 million worldwide in box office ticket sales on a $44 million budget. It received mixed reviews for its humor and subject matter, although a few critics praised the performances of Rogen, Franco, Park and [[Diana Bang]].\n\n==Plot==\nDave Skylark is the host of the [[talk show]] ''Skylark Tonight'', where he interviews various celebrities about personal topics and gossip. After Skylark and his crew celebrate their producer Aaron Rapaport's 1,000th episode, Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticized the show as not being a real news program. Rapaport reveals his concern and urge for change, to which Skylark agrees. Later, Skylark discovers that [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] is a fan of ''Skylark Tonight'', prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview for him. Rapaport travels to a place outside [[Dandong]], [[China]] to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, the [[Propaganda in North Korea|North Korean chief propagandist]], and Rapaport accepts the task of interviewing Kim on behalf of Skylark.\n\nThe next day, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Lacey shows up at Skylark and Rapaport's place, proposing that the duo assassinate Kim using a [[Transdermal patch|transdermal strip]] that will expose Kim to [[ricin]] via handshake; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the ricin strip hidden inside a pack of gum. Upon their arrival in the [[Residences of North Korean leaders|presidential palace]] in [[Pyongyang]], they are introduced to security officers Koh and Yu; Koh discovers the strip and chews it, believing it to be gum. That night, Lacey airdrops them two more strips from a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], but in order to smuggle it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a [[Siberian tiger]] and then hide the container in his rectum. Later, Kim shows up and introduces himself to Skylark.\n\nSkylark spends the day with Kim by playing [[basketball]], hanging out and partying together. Kim persuades Skylark that he is misunderstood as both a cruel dictator and a failed administrator, and they become friends. At dinner, Koh has a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] due to the ricin poisoning and accidentally shoots Yu before dying. The next morning, Skylark feels guilty and discards one of the ricin strips, then thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After another dinner mourning the death of Kim's bodyguards, Skylark witnesses Kim's malicious side as he [[Korean conflict|threatens war]] against [[South Korea]] and \"every single enemy of his country\". Skylark leaves and after taking a walk, he discovers that a nearby grocery store is merely [[Potemkin village|fake]] and realizes that Kim has been lying to him. At the same time, during an attempted sex with Rapaport (who still has the ricin strip in his hand), Sook-yin reveals that she despises Kim and apologizes for defending the regime. Skylark, Rapaport and Sook-yin plan to ruin [[Kim Jong-un's cult of personality|Kim's cult of personality]] by causing him to cry on air. Before the broadcast starts, Kim gives Skylark a puppy as a gift to keep.\n\nDuring the internationally televised interview with Kim, Skylark addresses increasingly sensitive topics (including the country's [[North Korean famine|food shortage]] issues and [[Sanctions against North Korea|economic sanctions]] imposed by the US) and challenges Kim's need for [[Kim Jong-il|his father]]'s approval. Meanwhile, Sook-yin and Rapaport seize control of the broadcasting center and attack guards trying to cut off the broadcast. Despite his initial resistance, Kim eventually cries uncontrollably and soils himself after Skylark sings [[Firework (song)|\"Firework\"]] by [[Katy Perry]] (having learned of Kim's fondness of Perry earlier), ruining his reputation. Feeling betrayed and labeling Skylark as a \"fake friend\", Kim shoots him and leaves, but Skylark survives due to a [[bulletproof vest]]. Skylark, Rapaport and Sook-yin regroup (with the puppy in tow) and escape the presidential palace with the unexpected help of a panel-control guard. The trio hijack Kim's [[T-54/T-55|personal tank]], originally given to [[Kim Il-sung]] by [[Joseph Stalin]], to get to their pickup point. Kim boards a helicopter while his own army attacks the group. He prepares a nuclear missile launch, but before he can issue the command to launch, Skylark shoots down Kim's helicopter, killing him. \n\nWith the immediate threat over, Sook guides Skylark and Rapaport to an escape route where they are rescued and loaded onto a rescue craft by three [[SEAL Team Six]] members disguised as [[Korean People's Army]] troops, while Sook goes to [[Pyongyang]] to ensure political stability. Back in the United States, Skylark writes a book about his experience while North Korea become [[denuclearization|denuclearized]] and [[democratization|democratized]] under Sook-yin, who steps in as an [[Transitional government|interim]] leader.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Franco]] as Dave Skylark\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Aaron Rapaport\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Agent Lacey\n* [[Randall Park]] as [[Kim Jong-un]]\n* [[Diana Bang]] as Sook-yin Park\n* [[Timothy Simons]] as Malcolm\n<!-- these are listed after the main six in the longer closing credits -->\n* Reese Alexander as Agent Botwin\n* [[Anders Holm]] as Jake\n* [[Charles Chun|Charles Rahi Chun]] as General Jong\n* [[Ben Schwartz]] as Daryl\n<!-- ones listed after here were minor characters such as Two-Fingered Man, Train Passengers, Korean Girl, Hot Korean Girls, Drone Pilot, etc. -->\n\nThe film also features [[cameo appearance]]s from [[Eminem]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Bill Maher]], [[Seth Meyers]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Brian Williams]] and [[Scott Pelley]].
