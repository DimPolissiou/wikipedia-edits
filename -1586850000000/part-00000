The band's name comes from the 1984 Dio album ''[[The Last in Line]]''. Following the death of Dio frontman [[Ronnie James Dio]] in 2010, the original lineup of drummer [[Vinny Appice]], bassist [[Jimmy Bain]], guitarist [[Vivian Campbell]], and keyboardist [[Claude Schnell]] reunited along with vocalist [[Andrew Freeman (musician)|Andrew Freeman]] to perform the Dio songs they originally recorded. The band released a studio album of original material without Schnell titled ''[[Heavy Crown (album)|Heavy Crown]]'' in February 2016.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Dio origins===\nFormer [[Black Sabbath]] members vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]] and drummer [[Vinny Appice]] formed Dio in October 1982 in the United States with bassist [[Jimmy Bain]] and guitarist [[Vivian Campbell]]. The band released their debut album, ''[[Holy Diver]]'' in May 1983. Since Ronnie James Dio and Jimmy Bain had played keyboards on the record, they recruited keyboardist [[Claude Schnell]] for live shows in 1983 and the following Holy Diver tour. Claude Schnell would later become a full member of Dio, and the band's first recorded effort as a quintet would be 1984's ''[[The Last in Line]]''. The band proceeded to release ''[[Sacred Heart (Dio album)|Sacred Heart]]'' in 1985 and ''[[The Dio E.P.]]'' in 1986 before Campbell was fired from the band. The remaining members were joined by guitarist [[Craig Goldy]] to release ''[[Dream Evil (album)|Dream Evil]]'' in 1987 before the departure of Bain, Appice and Schnell. They would not play in Dio together again, however Appice would return to the band between 1993 and 1998 as well as Bain between 1999 and 2004.\n\n===Formation and live performances (2012\u20132016)===\nAfter the death of Ronnie James Dio in 2010, Vivian Campbell set into motion the idea of reuniting the original members of Dio for the first time since his departure from the band in 1986.

The band's name comes from the 1984 Dio album ''[[The Last in Line]]''. Following the death of Dio frontman [[Ronnie James Dio]] in 2010, the original lineup of drummer [[Vinny Appice]], bassist [[Jimmy Bain]], guitarist [[Vivian Campbell]], and keyboardist [[Claude Schnell]] reunited along with vocalist [[Andrew Freeman (musician)|Andrew Freeman]] to perform the Dio songs they originally recorded. The band released a studio album of original material without Schnell titled ''[[Heavy Crown (album)|Heavy Crown]]'' in February 2016.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Dio origins===\nFormer [[Black Sabbath]] members vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]] and drummer [[Vinny Appice]] formed Dio in October 1982 in the United States with bassist [[Jimmy Bain]] and guitarist [[Vivian Campbell]]. The band released their debut album, ''[[Holy Diver]]'' in May 1983. Since Ronnie James Dio and Jimmy Bain had played keyboards on the record, they recruited keyboardist [[Claude Schnell]] for live shows in 1983 and the following Holy Diver tour. Claude Schnell would later become a full member of Dio, and the band's first recorded effort as a quintet would be 1984's ''[[The Last in Line]]''. The band proceeded to release ''[[Sacred Heart (Dio album)|Sacred Heart]]'' in 1985 and ''[[The Dio E.P.]]'' in 1986 before Campbell was fired from the band. The remaining members were joined by guitarist [[Craig Goldy]] to release ''[[Dream Evil (album)|Dream Evil]]'' in 1987 before the departure of Bain, Appice and Schnell. They would not play in Dio together again, however Appice would return to the band between 1993 and 1998 as well as Bain between 1999 and 2004.\n\n===Formation and live performances (2012\u20132016)===\nAfter the death of Ronnie James Dio in 2010, Vivian Campbell set into motion the idea of reuniting the original members of Dio for the first time since his departure from the band in 1986. The idea came to fruition when he joined Appice, Bain and Schnell for a jam session with vocalist [[Andrew Freeman (musician)|Andrew Freeman]] in February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-dio-members-campbell-appice-bain-schnell-reunite-plan-live-shows/ |title=Former Dio Members Campbell, Appice, Bain, Schnell Reunite, Plan Live Shows |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=May 4, 2012 |accessdate=23 January 2016}}</ref> In May 2012 it was announced that the group would begin performing live shows under the name Last in Line, after the first album they had released together (minus Freeman) with Dio.

D-glucose is first protected by forming the [[peracetate]] by addition of [[acetic anhydride]] in [[acetic acid]], and then addition of [[hydrogen bromide]] which brominates at the 5-position. On addition of the alcohol ROH and lithium carbonate, the OR replaces the bromine and on deprotecting the acetylated hydroxyls the product is synthesized in relatively high purity. It was suggested by Joshi ''et al.'' (2001) that lithium acts as the nucleophile that attacks the carbon at the 5-position and through a transition state the alcohol is substituted for the bromine group. Advantages of this method as well as its stereoselectivity and low cost of the lithium salt include that it can be done at room temperature and its yield compares relatively well with the conventional Koenigs-Knorr method.<ref>Wilhelm Koenigs and Edward Knorr (1901). \"Ueber einige Derivate des Traubenzuckers und der Galactose (p )\".

These activated biochemical intermediates are known as [[nucleotide sugar|sugar nucleotide]]s or sugar donors. Many biosynthetic pathways use mono- or oligosaccharides activated by a diphosphate linkage to lipids, such as [[dolichol]]. These activated donors are then substrates for enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferase]]s, which transfer the sugar unit from the activated donor to an accepting [[nucleophile]] (the acceptor substrate).\n[[File:Fluorine.Directed.Glycosylation.tif|thumb|187x187px|C.

The best condition for use of CP was found to be in the presence of IL AMMOENG 101 and ethyl acetate.\n\n== Directed glycosylations ==\n\nMultiple chemical approaches exist to encourage selectivity of '''\u03b1-''' and '''\u03b2-glycosidic bonds.''' The highly substrate specific nature of the selectivity and the overall activity of the pyranoside can provide major synthetic difficulties. The overall specificity of the glycosylation can be improved by utilizing approaches which take into account the relative transition states that the anomeric carbon can undergo during a typical glycosylation. Most notably, recognition and incorporation of Felkin-Ahn-Eisenstein models into rationale chemical design can generally provide reliable results provided the transformation can undergo this type of conformational control in the transition state.\n\nFluorine directed glycosylations represent an encouraging handle for both B selectivity and introduction of a non-natural biomimetic C2 functionality on the carbohydrate. One innovative example provided by Bucher et al. provides a way to utilize a fluoro oxonium ion and the trichloroacetimidate to encourage B stereoselectivity through the gauche effect. This reasonable stereoselectivity is clear through visualization of the Felkin-Ahn models of the possible chair forms.\n\nThis method represents an encouraging way to selectivity incorporate B-ethyl, isopropyl and other glycosides with typical trichloroacetimidate chemistry.\n\n[[File:Control of Oxonium ion - Felkin-Ahn stereoselectivity .png|thumb|Control of Oxonium ion \u2013 Felkin-Ahn stereoselectivity]]\n\n== O-linked glycopeptides; pharmaceutical uses of O-glycosylated peptides ==\n\n[[File:Control of Oxonium ion - Felkin-Ahn stereoselectivity2.png|thumb|Control of oxonium ion \u2013 Felkin-Ahn stereoselectivity chair forms]]\nO-linked glycopeptides recently have been shown to exhibit excellent CNS permeability and efficacy in multiple animal models with disease states. In addition one of the most intriguing aspects thereof is the capability of O-glycosylation to extend half life, decrease clearance, and improve PK/PD thereof the active peptide beyond increasing CNS penetration. The innate utilization of sugars as solubilizing moieties in Phase II and III metabolism (glucuronic acids) has remarkably allowed an evolutionary advantage in that mammalian enzymes are not directly evolved to degrade O glycosylated products on larger moieties.\n\nThe peculiar nature of O-linked glycopeptides is that there are numerous examples which are CNS penetrant. The fundamental basis of this effect is thought to involve \"membrane hopping\" or \"hop diffusion\". The non-brownian motion driven \"hop diffusion\" process is thought to occur due to discontinuity of the plasma membrane. \"Hop diffusion\" notably combines free diffusion and intercomparmental transitions. Recent examples notably include high permeability of met-enkephalin analogs amongst other peptides. The full mOR agonist pentapeptide DAMGO is also CNS penetrant upon introduction of glycosylation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Egleton|first=Richard D|last2=Mitchell|first2=Scott A|last3=Huber|first3=Jason D|last4=Janders|first4=Jaqueline|last5=Stropova|first5=Dagmar|last6=Polt|first6=Robin|last7=Yamamura|first7=Henry I|last8=Hruby|first8=Victor J|last9=Davis|first9=Thomas P|date=2000-10-20|title=Improved bioavailability to the brain of glycosylated Met-enkephalin analogs|journal=Brain Research|volume=881|issue=1|pages=37\u201346|doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(00)02794-3|pmid=11033091}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polt|first=Robin|last2=Dhanasekaran|first2=Muthu|last3=Keyari|first3=Charles M.|date=2005-09-01|title=Glycosylated neuropeptides: a new vista for neuropsychopharmacology?|journal=Medicinal Research Reviews|volume=25|issue=5|pages=557\u2013585|doi=10.1002/med.20039|issn=0198-6325|pmid=16075406}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polt|first=Robin|last2=Dhanasekaran|first2=Muthu|last3=Keyari|first3=Charles M.|date=2005-09-01|title=Glycosylated neuropeptides: A new vista for neuropsychopharmacology?|journal=Medicinal Research Reviews|language=en|volume=25|issue=5|pages=557\u2013585|doi=10.1002/med.20039|issn=1098-1128|pmid=16075406}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Egleton|first=Richard D.|last2=Bilsky|first2=Edward J.|last3=Tollin|first3=Gordon|last4=Dhanasekaran|first4=Muthu|last5=Lowery|first5=John|last6=Alves|first6=Isabel|last7=Davis|first7=Peg|last8=Porreca|first8=Frank|last9=Yamamura|first9=Henry I.|date=2005-01-10|title=Biousian glycopeptides penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier|journal=Tetrahedron: Asymmetry|series=Carbohydrate Science.

D-glucose is first protected by forming the [[peracetate]] by addition of [[acetic anhydride]] in [[acetic acid]], and then addition of [[hydrogen bromide]] which brominates at the 5-position. On addition of the alcohol ROH and lithium carbonate, the OR replaces the bromine and on deprotecting the acetylated hydroxyls the product is synthesized in relatively high purity. It was suggested by Joshi ''et al.'' (2001) that lithium acts as the nucleophile that attacks the carbon at the 5-position and through a transition state the alcohol is substituted for the bromine group. Advantages of this method as well as its stereoselectivity and low cost of the lithium salt include that it can be done at room temperature and its yield compares relatively well with the conventional Koenigs-Knorr method.<ref>Wilhelm Koenigs and Edward Knorr (1901). \"Ueber einige Derivate des Traubenzuckers und der Galactose (p )\".

Glycoside hydrolases typically can act either on \u03b1- or on  \u03b2-glycosidic bonds, but not on both.  This specificity allows researchers to obtain glycosides in high epimeric excess, one example being Wen-Ya Lu's conversion of D-Glucose to Ethyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside using naturally-derived glucosidase.  It is worth noting that Wen-Ya Lu utilized glucosidase in a reverse manner opposite to the enzyme's biological functionality:<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Glucosidase-catalyzed glycosidation of D-Glucose to Ethyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside.png|none|thumb|545x545px|Lu, Wen-Ya et al.

These activated biochemical intermediates are known as [[nucleotide sugar|sugar nucleotide]]s or sugar donors. Many biosynthetic pathways use mono- or oligosaccharides activated by a diphosphate linkage to lipids, such as [[dolichol]]. These activated donors are then substrates for enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferase]]s, which transfer the sugar unit from the activated donor to an accepting [[nucleophile]] (the acceptor substrate).\n[[File:Fluorine.Directed.Glycosylation.tif|thumb|187x187px|C.

The best condition for use of CP was found to be in the presence of IL AMMOENG 101 and ethyl acetate.\n\n== Directed glycosylations ==\n\nMultiple chemical approaches exist to encourage selectivity of '''\u03b1-''' and '''\u03b2-glycosidic bonds.''' The highly substrate specific nature of the selectivity and the overall activity of the pyranoside can provide major synthetic difficulties. The overall specificity of the glycosylation can be improved by utilizing approaches which take into account the relative transition states that the anomeric carbon can undergo during a typical glycosylation. Most notably, recognition and incorporation of Felkin-Ahn-Eisenstein models into rationale chemical design can generally provide reliable results provided the transformation can undergo this type of conformational control in the transition state.\n\nFluorine directed glycosylations represent an encouraging handle for both B selectivity and introduction of a non-natural biomimetic C2 functionality on the carbohydrate. One innovative example provided by Bucher et al. provides a way to utilize a fluoro oxonium ion and the trichloroacetimidate to encourage B stereoselectivity through the gauche effect. This reasonable stereoselectivity is clear through visualization of the Felkin-Ahn models of the possible chair forms.\n\nThis method represents an encouraging way to selectivity incorporate B-ethyl, isopropyl and other glycosides with typical trichloroacetimidate chemistry.\n\n[[File:Control of Oxonium ion - Felkin-Ahn stereoselectivity .png|thumb|Control of Oxonium ion \u2013 Felkin-Ahn stereoselectivity]]\n\n== O-linked glycopeptides; pharmaceutical uses of O-glycosylated peptides ==\n\n[[File:Control of Oxonium ion - Felkin-Ahn stereoselectivity2.png|thumb|Control of oxonium ion \u2013 Felkin-Ahn stereoselectivity chair forms]]\nO-linked glycopeptides recently have been shown to exhibit excellent CNS permeability and efficacy in multiple animal models with disease states. In addition one of the most intriguing aspects thereof is the capability of O-glycosylation to extend half life, decrease clearance, and improve PK/PD thereof the active peptide beyond increasing CNS penetration. The innate utilization of sugars as solubilizing moieties in Phase II and III metabolism (glucuronic acids) has remarkably allowed an evolutionary advantage in that mammalian enzymes are not directly evolved to degrade O glycosylated products on larger moieties.\n\nThe peculiar nature of O-linked glycopeptides is that there are numerous examples which are CNS penetrant. The fundamental basis of this effect is thought to involve \"membrane hopping\" or \"hop diffusion\". The non-brownian motion driven \"hop diffusion\" process is thought to occur due to discontinuity of the plasma membrane. \"Hop diffusion\" notably combines free diffusion and intercomparmental transitions. Recent examples notably include high permeability of met-enkephalin analogs amongst other peptides. The full mOR agonist pentapeptide DAMGO is also CNS penetrant upon introduction of glycosylation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Egleton|first=Richard D|last2=Mitchell|first2=Scott A|last3=Huber|first3=Jason D|last4=Janders|first4=Jaqueline|last5=Stropova|first5=Dagmar|last6=Polt|first6=Robin|last7=Yamamura|first7=Henry I|last8=Hruby|first8=Victor J|last9=Davis|first9=Thomas P|date=2000-10-20|title=Improved bioavailability to the brain of glycosylated Met-enkephalin analogs|journal=Brain Research|volume=881|issue=1|pages=37\u201346|doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(00)02794-3|pmid=11033091}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polt|first=Robin|last2=Dhanasekaran|first2=Muthu|last3=Keyari|first3=Charles M.|date=2005-09-01|title=Glycosylated neuropeptides: a new vista for neuropsychopharmacology?|journal=Medicinal Research Reviews|volume=25|issue=5|pages=557\u2013585|doi=10.1002/med.20039|issn=0198-6325|pmid=16075406}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polt|first=Robin|last2=Dhanasekaran|first2=Muthu|last3=Keyari|first3=Charles M.|date=2005-09-01|title=Glycosylated neuropeptides: A new vista for neuropsychopharmacology?|journal=Medicinal Research Reviews|language=en|volume=25|issue=5|pages=557\u2013585|doi=10.1002/med.20039|issn=1098-1128|pmid=16075406}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Egleton|first=Richard D.|last2=Bilsky|first2=Edward J.|last3=Tollin|first3=Gordon|last4=Dhanasekaran|first4=Muthu|last5=Lowery|first5=John|last6=Alves|first6=Isabel|last7=Davis|first7=Peg|last8=Porreca|first8=Frank|last9=Yamamura|first9=Henry I.|date=2005-01-10|title=Biousian glycopeptides penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier|journal=Tetrahedron: Asymmetry|series=Carbohydrate Science.

His job was to collect information about other countries' [[Chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological warfare]] capabilities under the name [[Project Coast]]. After his preliminary report, Basson became the head project officer and began to work on the country's chemical and biological weapons capability. He recruited about 200 researchers from around the world and received annual funds equivalent to [[USD|$]]10 million. In 1982, Basson is alleged to have arranged the killing of 200 [[SWAPO]] prisoners in ''Operation Duel''.<ref>{{Cite book\n|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/report/2001/southafrica.pdf\n|title=The Rollback of South Africa's Chemical and Biological Warfare Program\n|authors=Dr. Stephen F.

John Truter Financial Consultants and Sefmed Information Services. The companies were used to officially distance the military from the project, to procure necessary chemicals and channel funds for the research. According to later investigation, Basson had a free rein to do what he wanted. Delta G did most of the research, production and development of the chemical agents, while RRL developed chemical and biological [[pathogen]]s and allegedly was involved with [[genetic engineering]]. Protechnik was a large nuclear, biological and chemical warfare plant developing defences against chemical weapons. Infadel dealt with those on a smaller scale and concentrated on financing and administration of other units and possibly channelling funds between military and research facilities. Many of the employees were not aware of what they were involved with.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001/01/15/2001_01_15_058_TNY_LIBRY_000022507\n|title=The Poison Keeper\n|date=15 January 2001\n|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]\n|author=[[William Finnegan]]\n|accessdate=9 February 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s Basson and the project were allegedly involved with attacks and assassinations against members of [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid movements]].

Basson provided the [[Civil Cooperation Bureau]] (CCB) with lethal chemicals to be used against prominent anti-apartheid activists.

That included a large amount of [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] and [[Mandrax]] that were apparently exported or allegedly sold to drug dealers in communities active in the anti-apartheid movement (cf. Basson brownies).  Most of the stockpile disappeared afterwards. Scientists working on the project later stated that they believed it was to be used to create drug-laced [[tear gas]].

In 1995 the South African government hired Basson to work for [[Transnet]], a transportation and infrastructure company and possibly for other more secretive jobs. The US and UK governments suspected that during his visits to [[Libya]] between 1993-1995, Basson might have sold chemical and biological weapons secrets. In 1995, the government of [[Nelson Mandela]] rehired Basson as an army surgeon, allegedly due to US and UK pressure and possibly because the government wanted to keep an eye on him.\n\nIn 1996, South Africa\u2019s [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) began to investigate the SADF and determined that the army had probably used lethal toxins against ANC activists. Basson was connected to many of these attacks. In 1997, the CIA told the South African government that Basson intended to leave the country. When Basson was arrested in a [[sting operation]] in [[Pretoria]] in 1997, he had 1000 [[MDMA|ecstasy]] tablets with him. At the time, he had hundreds of secret [[Project Coast]] documents in his car. TRC began to investigate Project Coast which led them to suspect that Basson had sold his secrets to governments of countries like Libya and [[Iraq]]. In 1997 they asked the help of the [[Netherlands Institute for Southern Africa]] (NIZA) whose investigation report was included in the Truth Commission Files.\n\nAt the same time, the Office for Serious Economic Offences, the [[National Intelligence Agency (South Africa)|National Intelligence Agency]] (NIA) and the Gauteng Attorney-General's Special Investigation Team investigated Basson's affairs. Conflict of interest slowed down the Commission investigation but the TRC gained more information from OSEO. Basson appeared before the TRC on 31 July 1998 and gave evidence for 12 hours.<ref name=\"unidir.org\"/> While his  lawyers constantly interrupted the questioning with legal technicalities, the Commission determined that Basson had been the primary decision maker in Project Coast and should be put on trial.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJ7eAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Secrets+and+Lies:+Wouter+Basson+and+South+Africa%27s+Chemical+and+Biological+Warfare+Programme.%22&dq=%22Secrets+and+Lies:+Wouter+Basson+and+South+Africa%27s+Chemical+and+Biological+Warfare+Programme.%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_h8CU6uhJ8KstAaXoIGYDw&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA/ Secrets and Lies: Wouter Basson and South Africa's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme] Gould & Marlene Burger, Struik Publishers, 2002\n{{ISBN|9781868723416}}</ref>\n\n==Trial==\nBasson\u2019s trial began on 4 October 1999 in [[Pretoria]]. At the time, the South African media had dubbed him \"Dr Death\". Basson faced 67 charges, including [[drug possession]], [[drug trafficking]], [[fraud]] and [[embezzlement]] of a total of R36,000,000, 229 [[murder]]s and [[conspiracy to murder]] and [[theft]]. Basson refused to seek [[amnesty]] from the Truth Commission. The prosecution presented 153 witnesses, but the case soon began to turn against them. On 11 October 1999 Judge [[Willie Hartzenberg]] dismissed six important charges, including four charges of murder and possible involvement in 200 deaths in Namibia, because he stated that the South African court could not prosecute crimes committed in other countries. Basson was also included in the Namibian amnesty of 1989. Hartzenberg then adjourned the trial for two weeks. After 18 months of trial, he reduced the number of charges to 46.\n\nBasson called only one witness \u2013 himself. In July 2001 Basson began to present his own evidence, speaking for 40 days. He stated that he had learned about [[weapons of mass destruction]] from [[Saddam Hussein]], that he had indeed had free rein in the project and that he had exchanged information with foreign governments. Technically, all that was legal. The defence argued that Basson should have immunity for anything that had happened in Namibia. On 22 April 2002 Judge Hartzenberg dismissed all the remaining charges against Basson and granted him [[amnesty]]. In his judgement, the judge called the state's case \"fragmented and confusing\", and that it was largely superficial, hoping to convince the court of Basson's guilt in a manner which fell far short of the standard \"beyond reasonable doubt\". Judge Hartzenberg further added that the state seemed to have decided what the truth was and had urged the court not to believe anything that contradicted the state's version of the truth.<ref>'Dr Death' walks free</ref> The trial had lasted 30 months. The state tried to appeal the judgement due to legal inaccuracies, but the Supreme Court of Appeal refused to order a retrial in 2003, a step reserved for appeals that had no chance of success.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter his release, Basson continued to travel all over the world as a guest speaker, and has founded his own private medical practice.

It is known that in 1981, when he was working as a personal physician to state president [[P. W. Botha]], the country's Surgeon-General hired Basson to work for and form [[7 Medical Battalion Group]], a specialist unit of the [[South African Military Health Service]]. His job was to collect information about other countries' [[Chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological warfare]] capabilities under the name [[Project Coast]]. After his preliminary report, Basson became the head project officer and began to work on the country's chemical and biological weapons capability. He recruited about 200 researchers from around the world and received annual funds equivalent to [[USD|$]]10 million. In 1982, Basson is alleged to have arranged the killing of 200 [[SWAPO]] prisoners in ''Operation Duel''.<ref>{{Cite book\n|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/report/2001/southafrica.pdf\n|title=The Rollback of South Africa's Chemical and Biological Warfare Program\n|authors=Dr. Stephen F.

Purkitt\n|date=April 2001\n|publisher=[[USAF Counterproliferation Center]]\n|page=22\n|accessdate=9 February 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nProject Coast secretly researched chemical and biological warfare in violation of the international [[BTWC]] agreement. Basson created four [[front company|front companies]]; [[Delta G Scientific Company]]; [[Roodeplaat Research Laboratories]] (RRL), [[Protechnik]] and [[Infadel]], which in 1989 was split into two companies \u2013 D. John Truter Financial Consultants and Sefmed Information Services. The companies were used to officially distance the military from the project, to procure necessary chemicals and channel funds for the research. According to later investigation, Basson had a free rein to do what he wanted. Delta G did most of the research, production and development of the chemical agents, while RRL developed chemical and biological [[pathogen]]s and allegedly was involved with [[genetic engineering]]. Protechnik was a large nuclear, biological and chemical warfare plant developing defences against chemical weapons. Infadel dealt with those on a smaller scale and concentrated on financing and administration of other units and possibly channelling funds between military and research facilities. Many of the employees were not aware of what they were involved with.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001/01/15/2001_01_15_058_TNY_LIBRY_000022507\n|title=The Poison Keeper\n|date=15 January 2001\n|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]\n|author=[[William Finnegan]]\n|accessdate=9 February 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s Basson and the project were allegedly involved with attacks and assassinations against members of [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid movements]]. Leaders in South Africa, Angola and Namibia also claimed that the more dangerous chemicals were used for [[crowd control]] in the country, although the government claimed otherwise and claimed that chemical weapons were used against South African troops. Basson provided the [[Civil Cooperation Bureau]] (CCB) with lethal chemicals to be used against prominent anti-apartheid activists. Basson continued to travel all over the world to gather information about chemical and biological warfare programs and set up other [[shell company|shell]] and [[paper company|paper companies]] as additional front companies, possibly for [[money laundering]].<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://squat.net/koekoeroe/telewokwok/archief/basson.htm\n|title=Libya and the case against Wouter Basson\n|date=10 August 2001\n|publisher=[[Mail & Guardian]]\n|author=Marlene Burger\n|accessdate=9 February 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[F. W. de Klerk]] became president in 1990, he ordered that production of the chemicals be stopped and the lethal agents destroyed. Basson concentrated on non-lethal chemical agents and chemicals the government had not banned. That included a large amount of [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] and [[Mandrax]] that were apparently exported or allegedly sold to drug dealers in communities active in the anti-apartheid movement (cf. Basson brownies).  Most of the stockpile disappeared afterwards. Scientists working on the project later stated that they believed it was to be used to create drug-laced [[tear gas]]. In January 1992, FRELIMO troops conducted an operation near the South African border. During the course of the operation, they were allegedly exposed to what was thought to have been a chemical agent. Some of the soldiers died during the incident and others required hospitalisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv02167/04lv02264/05lv02335/06lv02357/07lv02372/08lv02378.htm|title=Chapter 6: Special Investigation into the death of President Samora Machel - The O'Malley Archives|website=www.nelsonmandela.org|access-date=2017-10-27}}</ref> Investigation by the [[United Nations]], United States and the United Kingdom identified it as [[3-quinuclidinyl benzilate|BZ]] nerve agent.

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn [[1896]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds 13 year old [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea.

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn [[1896]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds 13 year old [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea.

Thomas Pryor \"Tip\" Barnes was the 5th Georgia's color bearer for the entire war, who survived the wound with the amputation of a toe and kept \"a\" flag, as a sacred treasure, until his death in October 1905. Thereafter, a struggle ensued between the family and several of the living Co. G veterans as to whom should maintain possession of that flag that was so dear to both factions. The flag was kept by a daughter of Tip Barnes and there is a touching plea on her behalf for this position from the Ellaville paper at this time. The flag according to Barnes family descendants was originally presented to the company (or regiment) by the wife of Col. William T.

For the last week they have been practicing with their large guns over at the navy yard and when they first commenced the boys thought that the fight had begun. They were eating dinner at the time and they were so excited that they did not finish their dinner.  I told them that it might be the last dinner that I should get soon and I would eat a plenty.  On Wednesday Gen Bragg Came over to review this regiment and said that it was very well drilled for the time they have been in service.  We have four companies out of the regiment which only leaves six com-panies in the regiment.  I received a letter from home with a letter from your.  They stated that the crop was pretty good.

The French cuffs on his sleeves are noteworthy, and the fact that his rank insignia is worn on his shoulders, a detail that would change when the new Confederate rank system was adopted.]]\nOne of the most famous and most well-recognized names of the 5th Georgia, the name Clinch Rifles was named for General [[Duncan L. Clinch]] who served in the [[Seminole Indian War]]. The company, which was formed before the beginning of the civil war, fought in almost every engagement of the regiment and was dissolved by the end of the war in 1865.\n\n\"Formed in 1852, this unit wore a simple, elegant uniform of rifle dark green single-breasted frock coat and matching trousers. Green kepis were worn, the frontal device on the kepi being a laurel wreath with the initials 'CR' inside. The collar and French cuff flaps were outlined in the regimental (color) for the enlisted men and gold for the officers. Black leather equipment was worn as befitted a rifle unit.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The American Civil War: Armies of the Confederacy|pages=142}}</ref> As a rifle unit, this outfit was initially uniformed in dark green, but that pre-war finery would quickly disappear as the unit was absorbed into one of the state regiments that would eventually become Confederate regulars.\n\nThe uniform was also described by the unit commander to the governor of Georgia as follows: \"Our Dress uniform is a dress coat of dark green broad cloth, with gilt rifle buttons, and trimmed with gold lace and cord on the outside seams; cap of dark green with letters 'C.R.' surrounded with a gold wreath, light green pompon; wings of brass, army style. Our fatigue dress consists of a dark green cloth jacket, trimmed with gold lace, green cap and black pants.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Katcher|first1=Philip|last2=Volstad|first2=Ron|title=Men-at-Arms Series 207 American Civil War Armies (5): Volunteer Militia|location=London |publisher=Osprey |date=1989|isbn=0850458536|page=47}}</ref>\n\nThe company flag of the Clinch Rifles was presented on March 10, 1861. The Augusta Chronicle & Sentinel reported the presentation of a new flag for the Clinch Rifles. The article described the flag as being the design of \"the Confederate States,\" implying it was a First National, topped with a wreath of flowers. Associated with this company is a surviving example of a flag of the size typical of so-called \"Bible\" flags. It resides in the collections of the Georgia Historical Society of Savannah, and it is a small silk First National flag; the word \"Clinch\" with a white bar on it.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n{| width=\"835px\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14739819226).jpg|347px]]\n|[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14759689971).jpg|229px]]\n|[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14739862856).jpg|256px]]\n|- style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size:9.5pt\"\n|Clinch Rifles on May 10, 1861.\n|colspan=\"2\"|Men of Company A posing with a conquered Confederate banner.\n|}\n\n===Company B, Griffin Light Guards===\n\nDuring the Civil War, the Griffin Light Guards served as a line company.

(nicknamed the Color Company for their Irish heritage) of the 5th Georgia Infantry Regiment; this unit suffered heavy casualties at Chickamauga, serving in John K. Jackson's Bde, Cheatham's Div of Polk's Right Wing at the time. The regiment received gray uniforms in 1862 alongside the rest of the regiment. Another Irish regiment from Augusta - a sister company named the Montgomery Guards - formally Co K, [[20th Georgia Infantry]], was reported by the Augusta Daily Constitutionalist in January 12, 1861, as both companies in \"showy uniforms\" and carrying a \"beautiful new banner.\", and again in May 8, 1861, reporting the Irishmen with \"a handsome Confederate States banner.\"<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=DAILY CONSTITUTIONALIST [AUGUSTA, GA], February 6, 1861, p. 3, c. 1|url=https://scholarworks.uttyler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=cw_newstitles}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia - Irish America|url=http://www.minecreek.info/irish-american/georgia.html/}}</ref> As with the Clinch Rifles, their flagstaff was topped with a wreath of flowers. \n\n===Company G, Schley County===\n\nThere is little information on the Schley County of Company G, as the only account of them are through official documents and letters. Here is the final letter sent by Charles Womack of Schley County to his brother David, describing some routine done at the time by the company and the regiment:\n\nCamp Stephens June 22, 1861  Brother David,\n\nI wrote to you sometime since from this place and have waited until now for an answer, but have not received one yet.  The mail has go such around about that it is impossible that it has been miscarried and you did not receive it.  I hear where I should be glad to receive letters at anytime more especially as came from home.  We all are enjoying very good health to be so many men together in a sickly portion of country. I find here that it is more pleasant in the shade but in the sun I believe that it is better.   I cannot give you any information con-cerning the war at this place that is when it begin at this place.  All preparations for war are being executed with the same dispatch as it has been all this time.  Every train that comes to this point for the last few brings cannon five or six daily.  Some things that there will be no (end page 1, begin page 2) fight until after the Fourth of July. For the last week they have been practicing with their large guns over at the navy yard and when they first commenced the boys thought that the fight had begun. They were eating dinner at the time and they were so excited that they did not finish their dinner.  I told them that it might be the last dinner that I should get soon and I would eat a plenty.  On Wednesday Gen Bragg Came over to review this regiment and said that it was very well drilled for the time they have been in service.  We have four companies out of the regiment which only leaves six com-panies in the regiment.  I received a letter from home with a letter from your.  They stated that the crop was pretty good.  I know if they have seasons the crop ought to be good for I put it in good order before I left home.  Excuse this letter for there is a perfect moon around me all the time but I was determined to write you\n\nDirect\u20145th Regiment Ga Volunteers Schley Guards, Pensacola Fla    Charles Womack\n\n{{cite letter\n| first = Charles \n| last = Womack\n| recipient = Brother David\n| subject = RE: P.

Its headgear was a dark blue shako with a large brass state coat of arms over the letters 'UG' within a wreath on the front and a yellow pompon. The frock coat was dark blue, with three rows of six buttons down and front, each three being connected by a double row of buff lace; the standing collar was edge in buff lace, as were the cuffs, with three lace buttonholes on each; buff epaulettes were worn by the enlisted men.

Company H is one of the many examples of hardships that the 5th Georgia undertook during its activity in the war. Their battle flag, which, according to museum provenance, was presented in April 1861 and had been ordered from Richmond, Virginia. The wool bunting flag features seven stars with the left side of the circle open, forming a horseshoe. The flag was given in 1906 to Miss Annie E. Campbell, who presented it to the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) in 1941; one of the few remaining remnants of the companies existence.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Civil War regiments from Georgia]]\n*[[Alabama in the Civil War]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*Georgia [http://www.usgwarchives.net/ga/military/civilwar/csamilitary.html USGenWeb] Archives Project - Civil War Records - Individual Soldiers\n*[https://familysearch.org/search/collection/1932370 Georgia, Civil War Service Records of Confederate Soldiers, 1861-1865]\n*[https://familysearch.org/search/collection/1932397 Georgia, Civil War Service Records of Union Soldiers, 1861-1865]\n*[https://familysearch.org/search/collection/2126718 Georgia, Confederate Home Records, 1901-1930]\n*[http://www.georgiaarchives.org/what_do_we_have/online_records/confederate_muster_rolls/CMR_main.htm GeorgiaArchives.org Copy of some Georgia Regiment muster roster (hand written)&nbsp; ]\n\n[[Category:1861 establishments in Florida]]\n[[Category:1865 disestablishments]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1861]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1865]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: in January 12, 1861 \u2192 on January 12, 1861 (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_Georgia_Volunteer_Infantry"}
