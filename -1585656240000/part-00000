Sedan debuted on Broadway in 1916 and appeared in his first motion picture for [[Metro Pictures Corporation]] in 1921.\n\nHe became a prolific character actor and is probably best remembered by movie buffs as the hotel manager in ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939) starring [[Greta Garbo]]. Around the same time, he appeared in an uncredited role as the [[Emerald City]]'s Balloon Ascensionist in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939). He returned to Broadway, performing in several different shows during the first half of the 1940s and in the 1950s began a sequence of guest roles in [[television]] series such as ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''. His most frequent TV work came from recurring roles as hapless mail carriers (25 episodes as Mr. Beasley on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]''; four episodes as Mr. Briggs on ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]''). He was also seen as the train conductor in the film ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), and in bit parts in two other Gene Wilder pictures. Rolfe Sedan remained active throughout a career that spanned more than six decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P38xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=C6UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3271,897299&dq=rolfe-sedan&hl=en|title=TV postman Sedan|date=September 23, 1982|work=[[The Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Death ==\nSedan died in 1982 in [[Pacific Palisades, California]] from heart problems at age 86.\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{div col}}\n* ''[[The Conquering Power]]'' (1921) -

Sedan debuted on Broadway in 1916 and appeared in his first motion picture for [[Metro Pictures Corporation]] in 1921.\n\nHe became a prolific character actor and is probably best remembered by movie buffs as the hotel manager in ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939) starring [[Greta Garbo]]. Around the same time, he appeared in an uncredited role as the [[Emerald City]]'s Balloon Ascensionist in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939). He returned to Broadway, performing in several different shows during the first half of the 1940s and in the 1950s began a sequence of guest roles in [[television]] series such as ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''. His most frequent TV work came from recurring roles as hapless mail carriers (25 episodes as Mr. Beasley on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]''; four episodes as Mr. Briggs on ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]''). He was also seen as the train conductor in the film ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), and in bit parts in two other Gene Wilder pictures. Rolfe Sedan remained active throughout a career that spanned more than six decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P38xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=C6UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3271,897299&dq=rolfe-sedan&hl=en|title=TV postman Sedan|date=September 23, 1982|work=[[The Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Death ==\nSedan died in 1982 in [[Pacific Palisades, California]] from heart problems at age 86.\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{div col}}\n* ''[[The Conquering Power]]'' (1921) -

The term ''[[Vanilla software|vanilla]]'' is often used to make this distinction. \"Vanilla ''[[Battlefield 1942]]''\", for example, refers to the original, unmodified game.\n\nAs early as the 1980s, video game mods have also been used for the sole purpose of creating art, as opposed to an actual game. This can include recording in-game actions as a film, as well as attempting to reproduce real-life areas inside a game with no regard for game play value. This has led to the rise of [[Video game art|artistic video game modification]], as well as [[machinima]] and the [[demoscene]].\n\nPopular games can have tens of thousands of mods created for them.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dey |first1=Tapajit |last2=Massengill |first2=Jacob Logan |last3=Mockus |first3=Audris |title=Analysis of Popularity of Game Mods: A Case Study |journal=Proceedings of the 2016 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play |date=16 October 2016 |pages=133\u2013139 |doi=10.1145/2968120.2987724 |isbn=9781450344586 }}</ref>  Popular websites dedicated to modding include [[Nexus Mods]], [[GameBanana]], [[Mod DB]], and [[Steam Workshop]].\n\n==Development==\nMany mods are not publicly released to the gaming community by their creators.<ref name=Poor/> Some are very limited and just include some gameplay changes or even a different loading screen, while others are total conversions and can modify content and [[gameplay]] extensively.

Early commercial mod-making tools were the ''[[Boulder Dash|Boulder Dash Construction Kit]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Bard's Tale Construction Set]]'' (1991), which allowed users to create game designs in those series. Much more successful among early mod-making tools was the 1992 ''[[Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures]]'' from [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.]], which allowed users to construct games based on the game world that was launched with the ''[[Pool of Radiance]]'' game.\n\nBy the mid 1990s, modding tools were commonly offered with PC games,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Burger-Helmchen |first1=Thierry|last2=Cohendet|first2=Patrick|title=User Communities and Social Software in the Video Game Industry |journal=Long Range Planning|date=October 2011|volume=44|issue=5\u20136|pages=317\u2013343|doi=10.1016/j.lrp.2011.09.003}}</ref> and by the early 2000s, a game that launched with no modding tools was considered more worthy of note in a review than one that did.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=Sarah |last2=Dyer-Witheford |first2=Nick |title=Playing on the digital commons: collectivities, capital and contestation in videogame culture |journal=[[Media, Culture & Society]] |date=2007 |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=934\u2013953 |doi=10.1177/0163443707081700}}</ref> [[Maxis]] released the modding tools for ''[[The Sims]]'' (2000) before the game itself, resulting in a suite of fan-created mods being available at launch.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/65431/951-44-6448-6.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |page=68}}</ref>  The advertising campaign for ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' (2002) focused on the included [[Aurora toolset]].<ref name=\"auto7\"/> The [[Warcraft III World Editor|World Editor]] for ''[[Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos|Warcraft III]]'' (2002) allowed a variety of custom scenarios or maps to be created for the game, such as a number of [[tower defense]] and [[multiplayer online battle arena]] maps, the most notable of which was ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fanbyte.com/features/modding-made-warcraft-immortal/|title=How Modding Made Warcraft III Immortal|date=2019-03-25|website=Fanbyte|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref> The provision of tools is still seen as the most practical way that a company can signal to fans that its game is open for modding.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Poretski |first1=Lev |last2=Arazy |first2=Ofer |title=Placing Value on Community Co-creations: A Study of a Video Game 'Modding' Community |date=25 February 2017 |pages=480\u2013491 |doi=10.1145/2998181.2998301 |publisher=ACM|chapter=Placing Value on Community Co-creations |isbn=9781450343350 }}</ref>  Fans may also use and create [[open-source software]] tools for modding games.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite book |last1=Scacchi |first1=Walt |title=Modding as an Open Source Approach to Extending Computer Game Systems |journal=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology |volume=365 |date=2011 |pages=62\u201374 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24418-6_5 |language=en|isbn=978-3-642-24417-9 }}</ref>\n\nThere are also free content delivery tools available that make playing mods easier. They help manage downloads, updates, and mod installation in order to allow people who are less technically literate to play.

One such example is ''[[Homeworld 2]]'', which requires the program [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to build new in-game objects. However, there are free versions of Maya and other advanced modeling software available. There are also free and even [[open-source software|open-source]] modeling programs (such as [[Blender (software)|Blender]]) that can be used as well.\n\nFor advanced mods such as ''[[Desert Combat]]'' that are total conversions, complicated modeling and texturing software is required to make original content. Advanced mods can rival the complexity and work of making the original game content (short of the engine itself), rendering the differences in ease of modding small in comparison to the total amount of work required. Having an engine that is for example easy to import models to, is of little help when doing research, modeling, and making a photorealistic texture for a game item. As a result, other game characteristics such as its popularity and capabilities have a dominating effect on the number of mods created for the game by users.\n\nA game that allows modding is said to be \"moddable\". ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' as well as its predecessors, ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', are examples of highly moddable games, with an official editor available for download from the developer. ''[[Daggerfall]]'' was much less moddable, but some people released their own modifications nevertheless. Some modifications such as ''Gunslingers Academy'' have deliberately made the game more moddable by adding in scripting support or externalizing underlying code. ''[[Supreme Commander (video game)|Supreme Commander]]'' set out to be the 'most customisable game ever' and as such included a mod manager which allowed for modular modding, having several mods on at once.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nThe games industry is currently facing the question of how much it should embrace the players' contribution in creating new material for the game or mod-communities as part of their structure within the game. Some software companies openly accept and even encourage such communities. Others though have chosen to enclose their games in heavily policed copyright or Intellectual Property regimes(IPR) and close down sites that they see as infringing their ownership of a game.<ref>Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) \"Games: Technology, Industry, Culture\" in Terry Flew, New Media: an introduction (second edition), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101-114.</ref>\n\n===Portability issues===\nFor cross-platform games, mods written for the Windows version have not always been compatible with the Mac OS X and/or [[Linux]] ports of the game. In large part, this is due to the publisher's concern with prioritizing the porting of the primary game itself, when allocating resources for fixing the porting of mod-specific functions may not be cost-effective for the smaller market share of alternate platforms. For example, ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'', ported by [[Aspyr]] for Mac OS X, had file access issues specific to mods until the 1.61D patch. ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' does not have a working community mods menu for the Mac OS X version and, until the 3369 patch, had graphics incompatibilities with several mods such as ''Red Orchestra'' and ''Metaball''.\n\nAlso, mods compiled into platform-specific libraries, such as those of ''[[Doom 3]]'', are often only built for the Windows platform, leading to a lack of cross-platform compatibility even when the underlying game is highly portable. In the same line of reasoning, mod development tools are often available only on the Windows platform. [[id Software]]'s Doom 3 Radiant tool and [[Epic Games]]' [[UnrealEd]] are examples of this.\n\nMod teams that lack either the resources or know-how to develop their mods for alternate platforms sometimes outsource their code and art assets to individuals or groups who are able to port the mod.\n\nThe mod specialist site for Macs, [[Macologist]], has created GUI launchers and installers for many UT2004 mods, as well as solving cross-platform conversion issues for mods for other games.\n\n===Unforeseen consequences or benefits of modding===\nIn January 2005, it was reported that in ''[[The Sims 2]]'' (2004) modifications that changed item and game behavior were unexpectedly being transferred to other players through the official website's ''exchange'' feature, leading to changed game behavior without advance warning.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050305070257/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6857 Supernatural powers become contagious in PC game] by Will Knight, NewScientist, 7 January 2005</ref>\n\nAfter the Hot Coffee mod incident, there were calls from the industry to better control modders.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  There is concern about mods which show nudity, and Bestheda does not allow mods with nudity to be uploaded on its website.  Nexus allows for mods which allow nudity if breasts are not visible in the preview image.

This can also include adding revised dialog and music.\n\nExamples of overhaul mods include ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]: Revision'', which was given permission from publisher [[Square Enix]] to release on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] alongside the original game,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/13/9521011/deus-ex-revision-mod-release-steam|title=A massive overhaul for the original Deus Ex is now available on Steam|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=2015-10-13|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref> and ''[[Grand Theft Auto V|GTA 5]] Redux'', which not only improves the original game's textures, but also adds a new weather system, visual effects, and adjusts the wanted system, weapons, and vehicle handling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/that-gorgeous-gta-5-graphics-overhaul-mod-is-final/1100-6443721/|title=That Gorgeous GTA 5 Graphics Overhaul Mod Is Finally Available|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=2016-09-20|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref>\n\n===Randomizer===\nRandomizers are a type of user mod, typically atop games of the 8-bit and 16-bit generations, that keep the fundamental gameplay but randomize elements of the game to make it more of a challenge. Randomizers came out of the [[speedrunning]] community which had exhausted the challenge of racing through the game with one of the earliest being for ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' around 2015. In the ''Zelda'' randomizer, the mod moved the location of the dungeons, the layout of these dungeons, and the location of enemies in a random but procedurely generated manner (similar to [[roguelikes]]) based on a numerical seed, so that speedrunners would have to overcome these new changes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/what-happens-when-you-randomize-the-legend-of-zelda-1758777271 | title = What Happens When You Randomize The Legend Of Zelda | first=  John  |last =Harris | date= February 2, 2016 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref> Their popularity grew as randomizer playthroughs were popular with streaming media.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/ | title = How \"randomizers\" are breathing new life into old games | first = Scott | last = White | date = December 3, 2019 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref>\n\n===Add-on===\nAn ''add-on'' or ''addon'' is a typically small mod which adds to the original content of a specific game. In most cases, an add-on will add one particular element to a game, such as a new weapon in a shooting game, a new unit or map in a strategy game, a new vehicle or track in a racing game, items in a game like ''[[Minecraft]]'' or ''[[Terraria]]'', or additional contents in simulation games (such as new pilotable airplanes (e.g., the [[Airbus A330]] or [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]). This can be accomplished without changing any of the original game's existing content. Many games are flexible and allow this, however that is not always the case. Some add-ons occasionally have to replace in-game content, due to the nature of a peculiar game engine. It may be the case, for example, that in a game which does not give a player the option to choose their character, modders wishing to add another player model will simply have to overwrite the old one. A famous example of this type of mod can be found for the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] wherein modders may use downloadable tools to replace content (such as models) in the game's directory. The ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' series can also be modded with individual add-ons which are stored in a .VPK format, so that a player may choose to activate a given mod or not.\n\n===Unofficial patch===\nAn ''[[unofficial patch]]'' can be a mod of an existing game that fixes [[Software bug|bugs]] not fixed by an official patch or that unlocks content present in the released game's files but is inaccessible in official gameplay. Such patches are usually created by members of the game's fan base when the original developer is unwilling or unable to supply the functionality officially. ''[[Jazz Jackrabbit 2]]'' has an unofficial patch which adds and fixes many of its features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz2online.com/jcf/showthread.php?t=19489|accessdate=15 March 2014 |title=JJ2+ (last updated October 30, 2013) |date=2013-11-01}}</ref>  One downside of this type of mod is that leaked content can be revealed.

The term ''[[Vanilla software|vanilla]]'' is often used to make this distinction. \"Vanilla ''[[Battlefield 1942]]''\", for example, refers to the original, unmodified game.\n\nAs early as the 1980s, video game mods have also been used for the sole purpose of creating art, as opposed to an actual game.

One such example is ''[[Homeworld 2]]'', which requires the program [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to build new in-game objects. However, there are free versions of Maya and other advanced modeling software available. There are also free and even [[open-source software|open-source]] modeling programs (such as [[Blender (software)|Blender]]) that can be used as well.\n\nFor advanced mods such as ''[[Desert Combat]]'' that are total conversions, complicated modeling and texturing software is required to make original content. Advanced mods can rival the complexity and work of making the original game content (short of the engine itself), rendering the differences in ease of modding small in comparison to the total amount of work required. Having an engine that is for example easy to import models to, is of little help when doing research, modeling, and making a photorealistic texture for a game item. As a result, other game characteristics such as its popularity and capabilities have a dominating effect on the number of mods created for the game by users.\n\nA game that allows modding is said to be \"moddable\". ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' as well as its predecessors, ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', are examples of highly moddable games, with an official editor available for download from the developer. ''[[Daggerfall]]'' was much less moddable, but some people released their own modifications nevertheless. Some modifications such as ''Gunslingers Academy'' have deliberately made the game more moddable by adding in scripting support or externalizing underlying code. ''[[Supreme Commander (video game)|Supreme Commander]]'' set out to be the 'most customisable game ever' and as such included a mod manager which allowed for modular modding, having several mods on at once.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nThe games industry is currently facing the question of how much it should embrace the players' contribution in creating new material for the game or mod-communities as part of their structure within the game. Some software companies openly accept and even encourage such communities. Others though have chosen to enclose their games in heavily policed copyright or Intellectual Property regimes(IPR) and close down sites that they see as infringing their ownership of a game.<ref>Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) \"Games: Technology, Industry, Culture\" in Terry Flew, New Media: an introduction (second edition), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101-114.</ref>\n\n===Portability issues===\nFor cross-platform games, mods written for the Windows version have not always been compatible with the Mac OS X and/or [[Linux]] ports of the game. In large part, this is due to the publisher's concern with prioritizing the porting of the primary game itself, when allocating resources for fixing the porting of mod-specific functions may not be cost-effective for the smaller market share of alternate platforms. For example, ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'', ported by [[Aspyr]] for Mac OS X, had file access issues specific to mods until the 1.61D patch. ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' does not have a working community mods menu for the Mac OS X version and, until the 3369 patch, had graphics incompatibilities with several mods such as ''Red Orchestra'' and ''Metaball''.\n\nAlso, mods compiled into platform-specific libraries, such as those of ''[[Doom 3]]'', are often only built for the Windows platform, leading to a lack of cross-platform compatibility even when the underlying game is highly portable. In the same line of reasoning, mod development tools are often available only on the Windows platform. [[id Software]]'s Doom 3 Radiant tool and [[Epic Games]]' [[UnrealEd]] are examples of this.\n\nMod teams that lack either the resources or know-how to develop their mods for alternate platforms sometimes outsource their code and art assets to individuals or groups who are able to port the mod.\n\nThe mod specialist site for Macs, [[Macologist]], has created GUI launchers and installers for many UT2004 mods, as well as solving cross-platform conversion issues for mods for other games.\n\n===Unforeseen consequences or benefits of modding===\nIn January 2005, it was reported that in ''[[The Sims 2]]'' (2004) modifications that changed item and game behavior were unexpectedly being transferred to other players through the official website's ''exchange'' feature, leading to changed game behavior without advance warning.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050305070257/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6857 Supernatural powers become contagious in PC game] by Will Knight, NewScientist, 7 January 2005</ref>\n\nAfter the Hot Coffee mod incident, there were calls from the industry to better control modders.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  There is concern about mods which show nudity, and Bestheda does not allow mods with nudity to be uploaded on its website.  Nexus allows for mods which allow nudity if breasts are not visible in the preview image.

This can also include adding revised dialog and music.\n\nExamples of overhaul mods include ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]: Revision'', which was given permission from publisher [[Square Enix]] to release on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] alongside the original game,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/13/9521011/deus-ex-revision-mod-release-steam|title=A massive overhaul for the original Deus Ex is now available on Steam|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=2015-10-13|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref> and ''[[Grand Theft Auto V|GTA 5]] Redux'', which not only improves the original game's textures, but also adds a new weather system, visual effects, and adjusts the wanted system, weapons, and vehicle handling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/that-gorgeous-gta-5-graphics-overhaul-mod-is-final/1100-6443721/|title=That Gorgeous GTA 5 Graphics Overhaul Mod Is Finally Available|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=2016-09-20|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref>\n\n===Randomizer===\nRandomizers are a type of user mod, typically atop games of the 8-bit and 16-bit generations, that keep the fundamental gameplay but randomize elements of the game to make it more of a challenge. Randomizers came out of the [[speedrunning]] community which had exhausted the challenge of racing through the game with one of the earliest being for ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' around 2015. In the ''Zelda'' randomizer, the mod moved the location of the dungeons, the layout of these dungeons, and the location of enemies in a random but procedurely generated manner (similar to [[roguelikes]]) based on a numerical seed, so that speedrunners would have to overcome these new changes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/what-happens-when-you-randomize-the-legend-of-zelda-1758777271 | title = What Happens When You Randomize The Legend Of Zelda | first=  John  |last =Harris | date= February 2, 2016 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref> Their popularity grew as randomizer playthroughs were popular with streaming media.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/ | title = How \"randomizers\" are breathing new life into old games | first = Scott | last = White | date = December 3, 2019 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref>\n\n===Add-on===\nAn ''add-on'' or ''addon'' is a typically small mod which adds to the original content of a specific game. In most cases, an add-on will add one particular element to a game, such as a new weapon in a shooting game, a new unit or map in a strategy game, a new vehicle or track in a racing game, items in a game like ''[[Minecraft]]'' or ''[[Terraria]]'', or additional contents in simulation games (such as new pilotable airplanes (e.g., the [[Airbus A330]] or [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]). This can be accomplished without changing any of the original game's existing content. Many games are flexible and allow this, however that is not always the case. Some add-ons occasionally have to replace in-game content, due to the nature of a peculiar game engine. It may be the case, for example, that in a game which does not give a player the option to choose their character, modders wishing to add another player model will simply have to overwrite the old one. A famous example of this type of mod can be found for the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] wherein modders may use downloadable tools to replace content (such as models) in the game's directory. The ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' series can also be modded with individual add-ons which are stored in a .VPK format, so that a player may choose to activate a given mod or not.\n\n===Unofficial patch===\nAn ''[[unofficial patch]]'' can be a mod of an existing game that fixes [[Software bug|bugs]] not fixed by an official patch or that unlocks content present in the released game's files but is inaccessible in official gameplay. Such patches are usually created by members of the game's fan base when the original developer is unwilling or unable to supply the functionality officially. ''[[Jazz Jackrabbit 2]]'' has an unofficial patch which adds and fixes many of its features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz2online.com/jcf/showthread.php?t=19489|accessdate=15 March 2014 |title=JJ2+ (last updated October 30, 2013) |date=2013-11-01}}</ref>  One downside of this type of mod is that leaked content can be revealed.

Art mods are most frequently associated with [[video game art]]. However, modified games that retain their playability and are subject to more extensive mods (i.e. closer to total conversions) may also be classified as [[art game]]s.<ref name=cannon>Cannon, Rebecca. \"Meltdown\" from ''Videogames and Art'' (Clarke, Andy and Grethe Mitchell, eds.). Bristol: Intellect Books. Pp.40-42. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84150-142-0}}</ref> Art mods are usually designed to subvert the original game experience. One example is the ''Velvet-Strike'' mod for ''Counter Strike'' in which the players spray-paint anti-violence messages in multiplayer games as a form of [[performance art]]. Another example is Robert Nideffer's ''Tomb Raider I and II'' patches which were designed to subvert the unofficial ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)#Nude Raider|Nude Raider]]'' patch of the late 1990s by altering Lara Croft's sexual orientation.<ref name=stalker>Stalker, Phillipa Jane.

It was first published in 1950, edited by [[Wolfgang Schmieder]]. The catalogue's second edition appeared in 1990. An abbreviated version of that second edition, known as BWV<sup>2a</sup>, was published in 1998.\n\nBWV numbers were assigned to 1,126 compositions in the 20th century, and more have been added to the catalogue in the 21st century. The [[BWV_Anh.|Anhang (Anh.; Annex) of the BWV]] lists over 200 lost, doubtful and spurious compositions.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Loure bach.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The BWV is a [[thematic catalogue]], thus it identifies every movement of every composition by its first measures, like the opening of [[Partita for Violin No. 3 (Bach)|BWV 1006]], movement 2 (Loure) above]]\nThe first edition of the ''Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis'' was published in 1950. It allocated a unique number to every known composition by Bach. [[Wolfgang Schmieder]], the editor of that catalogue, grouped the compositions by genre, largely following the 19th-century [[Bach Gesellschaft]] (BG) edition for the collation (e.g. BG cantata number = BWV number of the cantata):{{sfn|Schmieder|1990}}\n# [[List of Bach cantatas|Kantaten (Cantatas)]], BWV 1\u2013224\n# [[List of motets by Johann Sebastian Bach|Motetten (Motets)]], BWV 225\u2013231\n# [[List of Masses, Mass movements and Magnificats by Johann Sebastian Bach|Messen, Messens\u00e4tze, Magnificat (Masses, Mass movements, Magnificat)]], BWV 232\u2013243\n# [[List of Passions and Oratorios by Johann Sebastian Bach|Passionen, Oratorien (Passions, Oratorios)]], BWV 244\u2013249\n# [[List of chorale harmonisations by Johann Sebastian Bach|Vierstimmige Chor\u00e4le (Four-part chorales)]], BWV 250\u2013438\n# [[List of songs and arias by Johann Sebastian Bach|Lieder, Arien, Quodlibet (Songs, Arias and Quodlibet)]], BWV 439\u2013524\n# [[List of organ compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach|Werke f\u00fcr Orgel (Works for organ)]], BWV 525\u2013771\n# [[List of solo keyboard compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach|Werke f\u00fcr Klavier (Keyboard compositions)]], BWV 772\u2013994\n# [[List of solo lute compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach|Werke f\u00fcr Laute (Lute compositions)]], BWV 995\u20131000\n# [[List of chamber music works by Johann Sebastian Bach|Kammermusik (Chamber music)]], BWV 1001\u20131040\n# [[List of orchestral works by Johann Sebastian Bach|Orchesterwerke (Works for orchestra)]], BWV 1041\u20131071, originally in two separate chapters: Concertos (BWV 1041\u20131065) and Overtures (BWV 1066\u20131071)\n# [[List of canons by Johann Sebastian Bach|Kanons (Canons)]], BWV 1072\u20131078\n# [[List of late contrapuntal works by Johann Sebastian Bach|Musikalisches Opfer, Kunst der Fuge (Musical Offering, Art of the Fugue)]], BWV 1079\u20131080\n\nThe {{lang|de|Anhang}} of the BWV listed works that were not suitable for the main catalogue, in three sections:\n* [[BWV Anh.

Several compositions were repositioned in the over-all structure of chapters organised by genre and {{lang|de|Anhang}} sections.{{sfn|Schmieder|1990}} In 1998 [[Alfred D\u00fcrr]] and Yoshitake Kobayashi published a small edition of the catalogue, based on the 1990 second edition.

The word 'Tara' is derived from the Sanskrit root 't\u1e5b', meaning to cross.<ref>David Gordon White ''The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India'', (Kindle Locations 1613\u20131615). University of Chicago Press. Kindle Edition. \"This coastal location reminds us of what may have been T\u0101r\u0101\u2019s original role: she was a goddess of navigation, of sea crossings\u2014 t\u0101r\u0101 is generated from the verb t\u1e5b, to cross over the sea.\"</ref> In many other contemporary Indian languages, the word 'tara' also means star.\n\n==Origin==\nAccording to the [[Adbhuta Ramayana]], when [[Sita]] in the form of [[Kali]] slew the demon [[Ravana]], [[Brahma]] and other deities propitiated her with hymns. Appeased, the goddess assumed the calmer form of Tara. Holding her sword in her right hand, she accepted a tiger skin loincloth from Brahma, removed her golden crown, piled her hair into a single [[dreadlock|jata]] atop her head and bound it with the serpent [[Akshobhya]]. [[Shiva|Rudra]] laid on the ground and requested the boon of Brahmavidya (knowledge) from her, to which she responded by placing her left foot on his chest and enlightening him. As thanks, Shiva offered Her a [[Nymphaea nouchali|blue lotus]] and a skull cup.\n\nA variant version speaks of Tara's demon-slaying form; a [[Asura|demon]] called Hayagriva wrought havoc everywhere, banishing the [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s from [[Amaravati]] and robbing them of their possessions. The devas approached Brahma, who in turn lead them to Kali. Kali created another goddess, Tara, from her third eye and sent her to defeat Hayagriva. In the ensuing battle, Tara slew Hayagriva.\n\nA version from the [[Kalika Purana]] associates Tara with [[Matangi]]. According to this version, when the devas were defeated by the demons [[Sumbha and Nisumbha]], they sought refuge in the Himalayas and began to propitiate Devi. At that time, Shiva's wife (in her dark-skinned form, Matangi) saw the devas and asked whom they were propitiating. Before the devas could answer, the fair-complexioned [[Mahasaraswati]] emerged from Matangi's body and replied that the devas were propitiating her. Since Mahasaraswati manifested from Matangi's body, the fair-complexioned, eight-armed goddess came to be known as [[Kaushiki]] (meaning \"sheath\"). In turn, Matangi's dark complexion caused her to be known as [[Kali]] and Ugratara. \n\nAnother non-popular version is when the firm landmass on Earth was created using fragments of Madhu and Kaitabh's bodies, that did not cause the birth of life because there was nothing other than water and firm landmass on Earth. Hence, creation was still incomplete. After water and Earth, the Sun was required to provide life force. To create the same, Mahashakti had taken the form of Tara and Mahadev had taken the form of Lord dakhineshar He and Goddess Tara were the reasons they had brought the sun into existence. Without the eternal sun, the Earth was just a mere orb covered in ice on which life could not have survived. That is why Devi Tara had appeared from whom the sun had to arise and supply light and energy to Earth. Tara has the capability to produce light, energy and heat. When the power met with the power of Akshobhya, their combined power became the source of the sun. When the combined powers of Lord Akshohya and Devi Tara got integrated in the sea, many pulsating energy orbs were created, in which it led to the expansion of energy. Goddess Tara created a tremendous air flow from her breath which hit the energy bodies and led to their union.\n\nThen the increasing source of energy inside the water started assuming the appearance of the eternal sun. Thus, the eternal sun appeared by the combined powers of Goddess Tara and Lord Akshobhya. Surya pays his thanks to Akshobhya and Taradevi for giving birth to him. Tara tells him that he has been born to give his life-giving sun rays to the world and give life to all beings. She requests Lord Surya to stay at his place and provide heat, light and life sustaining energy to the Earth. He will lead to the creation of day and night and will lead to the circle of seasons on Earth. She advises him to leave and carry out his duties of giving life to everyone. Lord Surya assured both that he will fulfill his purpose as given by them both to keep balance in the universe according to the laws of nature and not go against any law as he knows from the knowledge that they both have implanted inside him, which may put the universe in a catastrophe.\n\nNext, Tara had assumed the form of Goddess Shodashi to provide all forms of greenery and plants to the world. Devi Shodashi then placed a bamboo inside the earth and poured one drop of water from her waterpot, this gave birth to all plant life and then all forests, trees, plants and nature grew.\n\n==Iconography==\n[[Kali]] and Tara are similar in appearance. They both are described as standing upon a supine [[Shiva]] in an inert or corpse-like form. However, while Kali is described as black, Tara is described as blue. Both wear minimal clothing, however Tara wears a tiger-skin skirt, while Kali wears only a girdle of severed human arms. Both wear a [[Mundamala|garland of severed human heads]]. Both have a lolling tongue, and blood oozes from their mouths. Their appearances are so strikingly similar that it is easy to mistake one for the other. Tara is shown standing in '''Pratyalidha posture''' (in which the left foot is forward). Her [[Bhairava]] (consort) is [[Akshobhya]], a [[Bodhisattva]] who is in the form of a cobra coiled around Tara's matted hair. She wears a crown made of skulls of five meditating [[Buddhas]]. Tara has eight forms called Ashta Tara and the names are [[Ekajata]], Ugratara, Mahogra, Kameshwari, [[Chamunda]], [[Neela Saraswati]], Vajra, and [[Bhadrakali]]. Tara is said to be more approachable to the devotee (Bhakta) or [[Tantra|Tantrika]] because of her maternal instincts.\n\nLike Kali, furthermore, Tara in her Hindu context enjoys blood. In her hymn of a hundred names from the Mundamala-tantra, she is called \"She Who Likes Blood\", \"She Who Is Smeared with Blood\" and \"She Who Enjoys Blood Sacrifice\".\n\nTara can be distinguished visually from Kali primarily via her implements.

The word 'Tara' is derived from the Sanskrit root 't\u1e5b', meaning to cross.<ref>David Gordon White ''The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India'', (Kindle Locations 1613\u20131615). University of Chicago Press. Kindle Edition. \"This coastal location reminds us of what may have been T\u0101r\u0101\u2019s original role: she was a goddess of navigation, of sea crossings\u2014 t\u0101r\u0101 is generated from the verb t\u1e5b, to cross over the sea.\"</ref> In many other contemporary Indian languages, the word 'tara' also means star.\n\n==Origin==\nAccording to the [[Adbhuta Ramayana]], when [[Sita]] in the form of [[Kali]] slew the demon [[Ravana]], [[Brahma]] and other deities propitiated her with hymns. Appeased, the goddess assumed the calmer form of Tara. Holding her sword in her right hand, she accepted a tiger skin loincloth from Brahma, removed her golden crown, piled her hair into a single [[dreadlock|jata]] atop her head and bound it with the serpent [[Akshobhya]]. [[Shiva|Rudra]] laid on the ground and requested the boon of Brahmavidya (knowledge) from her, to which she responded by placing her left foot on his chest and enlightening him. As thanks, Shiva offered Her a [[Nymphaea nouchali|blue lotus]] and a skull cup.\n\nA variant version speaks of Tara's demon-slaying form; an [[Asura|demon]] called Hayagriva wrought havoc everywhere, banishing the [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s from [[Amaravati]] and robbing them of their possessions. The devas approached Brahma, who in turn lead them to Kali. Kali created another goddess, Tara, from her third eye and sent her to defeat Hayagriva. In the ensuing battle, Tara slew Hayagriva.\n\nA version from the [[Kalika Purana]] associates Tara with [[Matangi]]. According to this version, when the devas were defeated by the demons [[Sumbha and Nisumbha]], they sought refuge in the Himalayas and began to propitiate Devi. At that time, Shiva's wife (in her dark-skinned form, Matangi) saw the devas and asked whom they were propitiating. Before the devas could answer, the fair-complexioned [[Mahasaraswati]] emerged from Matangi's body and replied that the devas were propitiating her. Since Mahasaraswati manifested from Matangi's body, the fair-complexioned, eight-armed goddess came to be known as [[Kaushiki]] (meaning \"sheath\"). In turn, Matangi's dark complexion caused her to be known as [[Kali]] and Ugratara. \n\nAnother non-popular version is when the firm landmass on Earth was created using fragments of Madhu and Kaitabh's bodies, that did not cause the birth of life because there was nothing other than water and firm landmass on Earth. Hence, creation was still incomplete. After water and Earth, the Sun was required to provide life force. To create the same, Mahashakti had taken the form of Tara and Mahadev had taken the form of Lord dakhineshar He and Goddess Tara were the reasons they had brought the sun into existence. Without the eternal sun, the Earth was just a mere orb covered in ice on which life could not have survived. That is why Devi Tara had appeared from whom the sun had to arise and supply light and energy to Earth. Tara has the capability to produce light, energy and heat. When the power met with the power of Akshobhya, their combined power became the source of the sun. When the combined powers of Lord Akshohya and Devi Tara got integrated in the sea, many pulsating energy orbs were created, in which it led to the expansion of energy. Goddess Tara created a tremendous air flow from her breath which hit the energy bodies and led to their union.\n\nThen the increasing source of energy inside the water started assuming the appearance of the eternal sun. Thus, the eternal sun appeared by the combined powers of Goddess Tara and Lord Akshobhya. Surya pays his thanks to Akshobhya and Taradevi for giving birth to him. Tara tells him that he has been born to give his life-giving sun rays to the world and give life to all beings. She requests Lord Surya to stay at his place and provide heat, light and life sustaining energy to the Earth. He will lead to the creation of day and night and will lead to the circle of seasons on Earth. She advises him to leave and carry out his duties of giving life to everyone. Lord Surya assured both that he will fulfill his purpose as given by them both to keep balance in the universe according to the laws of nature and not go against any law as he knows from the knowledge that they both have implanted inside him, which may put the universe in a catastrophe.\n\nNext, Tara had assumed the form of Goddess Shodashi to provide all forms of greenery and plants to the world. Devi Shodashi then placed a bamboo inside the earth and poured one drop of water from her waterpot, this gave birth to all plant life and then all forests, trees, plants and nature grew.\n\n==Iconography==\n[[Kali]] and Tara are similar in appearance. They both are described as standing upon a supine [[Shiva]] in an inert or corpse-like form. However, while Kali is described as black, Tara is described as blue. Both wear minimal clothing, however Tara wears a tiger-skin skirt, while Kali wears only a girdle of severed human arms. Both wear a [[Mundamala|garland of severed human heads]]. Both have a lolling tongue, and blood oozes from their mouths. Their appearances are so strikingly similar that it is easy to mistake one for the other. Tara is shown standing in '''Pratyalidha posture''' (in which the left foot is forward). Her [[Bhairava]] (consort) is [[Akshobhya]], a [[Bodhisattva]] who is in the form of a cobra coiled around Tara's matted hair. She wears a crown made of skulls of five meditating [[Buddhas]]. Tara has eight forms called Ashta Tara and the names are [[Ekajata]], Ugratara, Mahogra, Kameshwari, [[Chamunda]], [[Neela Saraswati]], Vajra, and [[Bhadrakali]]. Tara is said to be more approachable to the devotee (Bhakta) or [[Tantra|Tantrika]] because of her maternal instincts.\n\nLike Kali, furthermore, Tara in her Hindu context enjoys blood. In her hymn of a hundred names from the Mundamala-tantra, she is called \"She Who Likes Blood\", \"She Who Is Smeared with Blood\" and \"She Who Enjoys Blood Sacrifice\".\n\nTara can be distinguished visually from Kali primarily via her implements. Four armed, she carries a sacrificial [[sword]], a severed head or skull cup, a [[Nymphaea nouchali|blue lotus]] and a [[flaying knife]]. Kali never holds a lotus or a flaying knife.\n\n==Tarapith temple==\n{{Main|Tarapith}}\n[[File:Maa_Tara_Temple.jpg|thumb|Maa Tara Temple]]\nThe [[murti]] at the Tara Ma [[mandir]] in the village of [[Tarapith]], a highly important Tantric site for Bengali [[Shaktas]] (and highly contested as to whether or not it is truly a [[Shakti Peeth|Shakti Pitha]]; scholarly evidence points towards yes), is mostly covered by Garlands of flowers.

{"title_page": "Business marketing", "text_new": "{{expert needed|Business|reason=The article is confusing and appears to contradict itself|talk=yes|date=September 2013}}\n{{Marketing}}\n'''Business marketing''' is a [[marketing]] practice of individuals or organizations (including commercial businesses, governments and institutions). It allows them to [[sales|sell]] products or services to other companies or organizations that [[resell]] them, use them in their products or services or use them to support their works. It is a way to promote business and improve profit too.\n\nBusiness marketing is also known as [[industrial marketing]] or [[business-to-business]] (B2B) marketing. Business-to-government marketing, while still classified within the B2B discipline due to the sharing of dynamics, does differ slightly.\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe practice of a [[purveyor]] of [[goods]] [[trading]] with another may be as old as [[commerce]] itself. In relation to marketing today, its history is more recent. Michael Morris, Leyland Pitt, and Earl Dwight Honeycutt say that for several years business marketing took \"a back seat\" to [[consumer marketing]].<ref>Morris, Pitt and Honeycutt, pg. xix</ref> This entailed providers of goods or services selling directly to households through [[mass media]] and retail channels. David Lichtenthal (professor of marketing at [[Zicklin School of Business]]) notes in his research that business marketing has existed since the mid-19th century. He adds that the bulk of research on business marketing has come in the last 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chauhan|first1=Gyan|last2=Anbalagan|first2=C|title=Strategy and Trends in B2B Business: Opportunities and Challenges - A Global Prospective|url=http://www.ifsmrc.org/sites/default/files/journals/pdf/6.%20AIJRM%202305JJ14%20Mani%20paper%20for%20AIJRM%20issue%203.pdf|website=International Faculty and Student Multi-Research Consortium|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThis began to change in the middle to late 1970s.

According to Jeremy Kourdi, more than half of marketing majors start their careers in business marketing rather than consumer marketing.<ref>{{cite book|title=More Great Ideas A Day: 365 more business ideas for each day of the year|date=2013|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2013|isbn=978-9814484664|page=266|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_SSJAAAAQBAJ&dq=marketing+majors+begin+their+careers+in+business+marketing+today+than+in+consumer+marketing.&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=6 August 2015|chapter=Business-To-Business Marketing}}</ref>\n\n== Business and consumer markets ==\n\nBusiness markets have derived demand \u2013 a demand in them exists because of demand in the [[consumer market]]. An example would be a government wishing to purchase equipment for a [[nuclear power plant]]. The underlying consumer demand that has triggered this is that people are [[electricity consumption|consuming more electricity]] (by using more [[home appliance|household device]]s such as washing machines and computers). Business markets do exist in isolation.\n\nA single consumer market demand can give rise to hundreds of business market demands. The [[car industry|demand for cars]] creates demands for castings, forgings, plastic components, steel and tires. In turn, this creates demands for casting sand, forging machines, mining materials, polymers, rubber. Each of these growing demands has triggered more demands.\n\nAs the spending power of citizens increases, countries generally see an upward wave in their economy. Cities or countries with growing consumption are generally growing business markets.\n\n== Vs. consumer marketing ==\n\nDespite the differences between business and consumer marketing from a surface perspective being seemingly obvious, there are more subtle distinctions between the two with substantial ramifications. Dwyer and Tanner note that business marketing generally entails shorter and more direct channels of distribution.\n\nWhile consumer marketing is aimed at large groups through [[mass media]] and [[retailer]]s, the negotiation process between the buyer and seller is more personal in business marketing. According to Hutt and Speh (2004), most business marketers commit only a small part of their promotional budgets to advertising, and that is usually through [[Direct marketing|direct mail]] efforts and trade journals. While advertising is limited, it often helps the business marketer set up successful sales calls.\n\nMarketing to a business is trying to make a profit (business-to-business marketing) as opposed to an individual for personal use ([[Business-to-consumer|Business-to-Consumer]], or B2C marketing) is similar in terms of the fundamental principles of marketing. In [[B2C]], [[business-to-business|B2B]] and [[government marketing|B2G]] marketing situations, the marketer must always:\n\n* successfully match the product or service strengths with the needs of a definable target market;\n* position and price to align the product or service with its market, often an intricate balance; and\n* communicate and sell it in the fashion that demonstrates its value effectively to the target market.\n\nThese are the fundamental principles of the 4 Ps of marketing (the [[marketing mix]]) first documented by [[E. Jerome McCarthy]] in 1960.<ref>McCarthy, Jerome E.: \"Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach\". Homewood, IL: Irwin, 1996</ref>\n\nWhile \"other businesses\" might seem like the simple answer, Dwyer and Tanner say business customers fall into four broad categories: companies that consume products or services, government agencies, institutions and resellers.\n\nThe first category includes [[original equipment manufacturers]], such as large auto-makers who buy [[Gauge (instrument)|gauges]] to put in their cars and also small firms owned by 1-2 individuals who purchase products to run their business. The second category - government agencies, is the biggest. In fact, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] is the biggest single purchaser of products and services in the country, spending more than $300 billion annually. But this category also includes state and [[local government]]s. The third category, institutions, includes schools, hospitals and [[nursing home]]s, churches and charities. Finally, resellers consist of wholesalers, brokers and industrial distributors.\n\nSo what are the meaningful differences between B2B and B2C marketing?\n* A notable characteristic of B2B marketing is that it is rarely 'product first' or 'service first'. Marketing messages lead with significant context that acknowledges the customer's need or problem first and then establishes the relevance of the vendor's product or service to the customer's situation.   In B2C marketing, the product or service features and benefits are called out up front. The customer is expected to already know why they need the product or service.\n* The buyer or customer is often a group or committee or department comprising several individuals who have specific roles in evaluating the proposed product or service.  In B2C, the buyer is mostly an individual who needs the product or service for his or her own use. Offerings are evaluated mainly on price, reviews and word of mouth, although these are factors in B2B marketing as well\n\nA B2C sale is to a \"Consumer\" i.e. to a single person who pays for the transaction. A B2B sale is to a \"Business\" i.e. organization or firm. Given the complexity of [[organizational structure]], B2B sales typically involve multiple decision makers.\n\nWhile the structure of a B2B sale involving an organization is understood, the psychology of a B2B sale, particularly from a marketing perspective, is not always devoid of human emotion. According to Bill Blaney (2012), a B2C and a B2B sale can be differentiated by the customer as either a \"want\" or a \"need.\" While retail consumer sales rarely hinge upon a product or service that customers \"need\" in order to survive (pharmaceutical and other health industry products notwithstanding), business sales are more directly applied to the growth and survival of that particular company, organization or institution. As a result, marketing to businesses relies on communication that can provide the company buyer with a level of comfort in the long-term performance of their product or service, and support in its continued efficacy.\n\nThe marketing mix is affected by the B2B uniqueness which include complexity of business products and services, diversity of demand and the differing nature of the sales itself (including fewer customers buying larger volumes).<ref>Kotler & Pfoertsch: \"B2B Brand Management\", page 21.

It is mainly of large scale when compared with B2C.\n\n=== Product (or service) ===\nDue to the fact that business customers are focused on creating [[shareholder value]] for themselves, the cost-saving or revenue-producing benefits of products and services are important to factor in throughout the [[New product development|product development]] and marketing cycles.\n\n=== Target market ===\n[[File:B2B buyer decision map.jpg|thumbnail|right|B2B Buyer Decision Map: Problem, solution alternatives, decision support]]Quite often, the [[target market]] for a business product or service is smaller and has more specialized needs reflective of a specific industry or niche.<ref>Malaval: \"Strategy and Management of Industrial Brands: Business to Business Products and Services\", page 16. 2001</ref> A B2B niche, a segment of the market, can be described in terms of [[firmographics]] which requires marketers to have good business intelligence in order to increase response rates.

Specific [[Trade fair|trade shows]], analysts, publications, blogs and retail/wholesale outlets tend to be fairly common to each industry/product area. Once it is figured out for the industry/product, writing the promotion plan is simple.

When selling through [[Distribution (business)|distribution channels]] also, the number and type of sales forces can vary tremendously and success as a marketer is highly dependent on their success.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of the B2B sales cycle is its comparably longer lead times compared to B2C.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.leadagency.com.au/marketing-consultant-melbourne/expertise/ | title=B2B Marketing Expertise - Strategy and campaigns}}</ref> The result of this longer lead cycle affects the entire B2B marketing process.\n\n=== Communications methodologies ===\n\nThe purpose of B2B marketing communications is to support the organizations' sales effort and improve company profitability. B2B marketing communications tactics generally include advertising, [[public relations]], direct mail, trade show support, sales collateral, branding, and interactive services such as [[Web design|website design]] and [[search engine optimization]]. The Business Marketing Association<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.marketing.org/ | title=ANA Business Marketing &#124; ANA}}</ref> is the [[Industry trade group|trade organization]] that serves B2B marketing professionals. It was founded in 1922 and offers [[Professional certification|certification programs]], research services, conferences, industry awards and training programs.\n\n==== Positioning statement ====\nAn important first step in business to business marketing is the development of a positioning statement. This is a statement of what is done and how it will be better and more efficient than competitors.\n\n==== Developing messages ====\nThe next step is to develop messages.  There is usually a primary message that conveys more strongly to customers, what is done and how the customers benefit from it. This is often supported by a number of secondary messages, each of which may have a number of supporting arguments, facts and figures.\n\n==== Campaign plans ====\nA comprehensive plan to target resources where they will deliver the best [[return on investment]]. The infrastructure to support each stage of the marketing process has to be in place and the entire organization must be geared up to handle the inquiries appropriately.\n\n==== Briefing an agency ====\nA standard briefing document is usually a good idea for briefing an agency, as well as focusing the agency on what is important in the campaign. It serves as a checklist of all the important things to consider as part of the brief.  Typical elements to an agency brief are: objectives, target market, [[target audience]], product, campaign description, product positioning, graphical considerations, corporate guidelines, and any other supporting material and distribution.\n\n==== Measuring results ====\nThe value in results measurement is in tying the marketing campaign back to business results. Metrics to measure the impact are  e.g. [[cost per acquisition]], [[cost per lead]] or tangible changes in customer perception.\n\n== Size ==\n\nHutt and Speh (2001) note that \"business marketers serve the largest market of all; the dollar volume of transactions in the industrial or business market significantly exceeds that of the ultimate consumer market.\" For example, they note that companies such as GE, [[DuPont]] and IBM spend more than $60 million a day on purchases to support their operations.\n\nDwyer and Tanner (2006) say the purchases made by companies, government agencies and institutions \"account for more than half of the economic activity in [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] such as the United States, Canada and France.\"\n\nA 2003 study sponsored by the Business Marketing Association estimated that business-to-business marketers in the United States spend about $85 billion a year to promote their [[goods and services]]. The BMA study breaks that spending out as follows (figures are in billions of dollars):\n\n* Trade Shows/Events -- $17.3\n* Internet/Electronic Media -- $12.5\n* Promotion/Market Support -- $10.9\n* Magazine Advertising -- $10.8\n* Publicity/Public Relations -- $10.5\n* Direct Mail -- $9.4\n* Dealer/Distributor Materials -- $5.2\n* [[Market research|Market Research]] -- $3.8\n* Telemarketing -- $2.4\n* Directories -- $1.4\n* Other -- $5.1\n\n== Growth ==\n\nThe tremendous growth and change that business marketing is experiencing is largely due to three \"revolutions\" occurring around the world today, according to Morris, Pitt and Honeycutt (2001).\n\n# Technological revolution. Technology is changing at an unprecedented pace, and these changes are speeding up the pace of new product and service development. A large part of that has to do with the Internet, which is discussed in more detail below. Technology and [[Strategic management|business strategy]] go hand in hand. Both are correlated.  While technology supports forming organization strategy, the business strategy is also helpful in [[Research and development|technology development]]. Both play a role in business marketing.\n#Entrepreneurial revolution. To stay competitive, many companies have downsized and reinvented themselves. Adaptability, flexibility, speed, aggressiveness and innovativeness are the keys to remaining competitive today. Marketing is taking the entrepreneurial lead by finding [[market segment]]s, untapped needs and new uses for existing products, and by creating new processes for sales, distribution and customer service.\n#(Occurring within marketing itself) Companies are looking beyond traditional assumptions and they are adopting new frameworks, theories, models and concepts. They are also moving away from the mass market and the preoccupation with the transaction. Relationships, partnerships and alliances are what define marketing today. The [[Cookie cutter|cookie-cutter]] approach is out. Companies are customizing marketing programs to individual accounts.\n\n== Impact of the Internet ==\n\nThe Internet has become an integral component of the [[customer relationship management]] strategy for business marketers. Dwyer and Tanner (2006) note that business marketers not only use the Internet to improve [[customer service]] but also to gain opportunities with distributors.\n\nAccording to Anderson and Narus (2004), two new types of resellers have emerged as by-products of the Internet: infomediaries and metamediaries. Infomediaries, such as [[Google]] and [[Yahoo]], are [[search engine]] companies that also function as brokers, or middlemen, in the business marketing world. They charge companies fees to find information on the Web as well as for banner and [[pop-up ad]]s and search engine optimization services. Metamediaries are companies with robust Internet sites that furnish customers with multiproduct, multivendor and multiservice marketspace in return for commissions on sales.\n\nWith the advent of b-to-b exchanges, the Internet ushered in an enthusiasm for collaboration that never existed before\u2014and in fact might have even seemed ludicrous 10 years ago. For example, a decade ago who would have imagined Ford, [[General Motors]] and [[DaimlerChrysler]] entering into a joint venture? That's exactly what happened after all three of [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|the Big Three]] began moving their purchases online in the late 1990s. All three companies were pursuing their own initiatives when they realized the [[Returns to scale|economies of scale]] they could achieve by pooling their efforts. Thus was born what then was the world's largest [[Dot-com company|Internet business]] when Ford's Auto-Xchange and GM's TradeXchange merged, with DaimlerChrysler representing the third partner.\n\nWhile this exchange did not stand the test of time, others have, including [[Agentrics]], which was formed in 2005 with the merger of WorldWide Retail Exchange and GlobalNetXchange, or GNX. Agentrics serves more 50 retailers around the world and more than 300 customers, and its members have combined sales of about $1 trillion. Hutt and Speh (2001) note that such virtual marketplaces enable companies and their suppliers to conduct business in real time as well as simplify purchase processes and cut costs.\n\n== Design ==\n\nB2B design often relies heavily on gradients. This is seen by some to represent the fluid nature of the sector and the democratic approach to design employed by B2B agencies.\n<ref>https://www.xmple.com/wallpaper/gradient-purple-blue-linear-5120x2880-c2-9400d3-00ced1-a-345-f-14.svg</ref>\n\n== References ==\n* Anderson, James C., and Narus, James A.

It allows them to [[sales|sell]] products or services to other companies or organizations that [[resell]] them, use them in their products or services or use them to support their works. It is a way to promote business and improve profit too.\n\nBusiness marketing is also known as [[industrial marketing]] or [[business-to-business]] (B2B) marketing. Business - to - government marketing, while still classified within the B2B discipline due to the sharing of dynamics, does differ slightly.\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe practice of a [[purveyor]] of [[goods]] [[trading]] with another may be as old as [[commerce]] itself. In relation to marketing today, its history is more recent. Michael Morris, Leyland Pitt, and Earl Dwight Honeycutt say that for several years business marketing took \"a back seat\" to [[consumer marketing]].<ref>Morris, Pitt and Honeycutt, pg. xix</ref> This entailed providers of goods or services selling directly to households through [[mass media]] and retail channels. David Lichtenthal (professor of marketing at [[Zicklin School of Business]]) notes in his research that business marketing has existed since the mid-19th century. He adds that the bulk of research on business marketing has come in the last 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chauhan|first1=Gyan|last2=Anbalagan|first2=C|title=Strategy and Trends in B2B Business: Opportunities and Challenges - A Global Prospective|url=http://www.ifsmrc.org/sites/default/files/journals/pdf/6.%20AIJRM%202305JJ14%20Mani%20paper%20for%20AIJRM%20issue%203.pdf|website=International Faculty and Student Multi-Research Consortium|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThis began to change in the middle to late 1970s.

According to Jeremy Kourdi, more than half of marketing majors start their careers in business marketing rather than consumer marketing.<ref>{{cite book|title=More Great Ideas A Day: 365 more business ideas for each day of the year|date=2013|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2013|isbn=978-9814484664|page=266|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_SSJAAAAQBAJ&dq=marketing+majors+begin+their+careers+in+business+marketing+today+than+in+consumer+marketing.&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=6 August 2015|chapter=Business-To-Business Marketing}}</ref>\n\n== Business and consumer markets ==\n\nBusiness markets have derived demand \u2013 a demand in them exists because of demand in the [[consumer market]]. An example would be a government wishing to purchase equipment for a [[nuclear power plant]]. The underlying consumer demand that has triggered this is that people are [[electricity consumption|consuming more electricity]] (by using more [[home appliance|household device]]s such as washing machines and computers). Business markets do exist in isolation.\n\nA single consumer market demand can give rise to hundreds of business market demands. The [[car industry|demand for cars]] creates demands for castings, forgings, plastic components, steel and tires. In turn, this creates demands for casting sand, forging machines, mining materials, polymers, rubber. Each of these growing demands has triggered more demands.\n\nAs the spending power of citizens increases, countries generally see an upward wave in their economy. Cities or countries with growing consumption are generally growing business markets.\n\n== Vs. consumer marketing ==\n\nDespite the differences between business and consumer marketing from a surface perspective being seemingly obvious, there are more subtle distinctions between the two with substantial ramifications. Dwyer and Tanner note that business marketing generally entails shorter and more direct channels of distribution.\n\nWhile consumer marketing is aimed at large groups through [[mass media]] and [[retailer]]s, the negotiation process between the buyer and seller is more personal in business marketing. According to Hutt and Speh (2004), most business marketers commit only a small part of their promotional budgets to advertising, and that is usually through [[Direct marketing|direct mail]] efforts and trade journals. While advertising is limited, it often helps the business marketer set up successful sales calls.\n\nMarketing to a business is trying to make a profit (business-to-business marketing) as opposed to an individual for personal use ([[Business-to-consumer|Business-to-Consumer]], or B2C marketing) is similar in terms of the fundamental principles of marketing. In [[B2C]], [[business-to-business|B2B]] and [[government marketing|B2G]] marketing situations, the marketer must always:\n\n* successfully match the product or service strengths with the needs of a definable target market;\n* position and price to align the product or service with its market, often an intricate balance; and\n* communicate and sell it in the fashion that demonstrates its value effectively to the target market.\n\nThese are the fundamental principles of the 4 Ps of marketing (the [[marketing mix]]) first documented by [[E.

There is usually a primary message that conveys more strongly to customers, what is done and how the customers benefit from it. This is often supported by a number of secondary messages, each of which may have a number of supporting arguments, facts and figures.\n\n==== Campaign plans ====\nA comprehensive plan to target resources where they will deliver the best [[return on investment]]. The infrastructure to support each stage of the marketing process has to be in place and the entire organization must be geared up to handle the inquiries appropriately.\n\n==== Briefing an agency ====\nA standard briefing document is usually a good idea for briefing an agency, as well as focusing the agency on what is important in the campaign. It serves as a checklist of all the important things to consider as part of the brief.  Typical elements to an agency brief are: objectives, target market, [[target audience]], product, campaign description, product positioning, graphical considerations, corporate guidelines, and any other supporting material and distribution.\n\n==== Measuring results ====\nThe value in results measurement is in tying the marketing campaign back to business results. Metrics to measure the impact are  e.g. [[cost per acquisition]], [[cost per lead]] or tangible changes in customer perception.\n\n== Size ==\n\nHutt and Speh (2001) note that \"business marketers serve the largest market of all; the dollar volume of transactions in the industrial or business market significantly exceeds that of the ultimate consumer market.\" For example, they note that companies such as GE, [[DuPont]] and IBM spend more than $60 million a day on purchases to support their operations.\n\nDwyer and Tanner (2006) say the purchases made by companies, government agencies and institutions \"account for more than half of the economic activity in [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] such as the United States, Canada and France.\"\n\nA 2003 study sponsored by the Business Marketing Association estimated that business-to-business marketers in the United States spend about $85 billion a year to promote their [[goods and services]]. The BMA study breaks that spending out as follows (figures are in billions of dollars):\n\n* Trade Shows/Events -- $17.3\n* Internet/Electronic Media -- $12.5\n* Promotion/Market Support -- $10.9\n* Magazine Advertising -- $10.8\n* Publicity/Public Relations -- $10.5\n* Direct Mail -- $9.4\n* Dealer/Distributor Materials -- $5.2\n* [[Market research|Market Research]] -- $3.8\n* Telemarketing -- $2.4\n* Directories -- $1.4\n* Other -- $5.1\n\n== Growth ==\n\nThe tremendous growth and change that business marketing is experiencing is largely due to three \"revolutions\" occurring around the world today, according to Morris, Pitt and Honeycutt (2001).\n\n# Technological revolution. Technology is changing at an unprecedented pace, and these changes are speeding up the pace of new product and service development. A large part of that has to do with the Internet, which is discussed in more detail below. Technology and [[Strategic management|business strategy]] go hand in hand. Both are correlated.  While technology supports forming organization strategy, the business strategy is also helpful in [[Research and development|technology development]]. Both play a role in business marketing.\n#Entrepreneurial revolution. To stay competitive, many companies have downsized and reinvented themselves. Adaptability, flexibility, speed, aggressiveness and innovativeness are the keys to remaining competitive today. Marketing is taking the entrepreneurial lead by finding [[market segment]]s, untapped needs and new uses for existing products, and by creating new processes for sales, distribution and customer service.\n#(Occurring within marketing itself) Companies are looking beyond traditional assumptions and they are adopting new frameworks, theories, models and concepts. They are also moving away from the mass market and the preoccupation with the transaction. Relationships, partnerships and alliances are what define marketing today. The [[Cookie cutter|cookie-cutter]] approach is out. Companies are customizing marketing programs to individual accounts.\n\n== Impact of the Internet ==\n\nThe Internet has become an integral component of the [[customer relationship management]] strategy for business marketers. Dwyer and Tanner (2006) note that business marketers not only use the Internet to improve [[customer service]] but also to gain opportunities with distributors.\n\nAccording to Anderson and Narus (2004), two new types of resellers have emerged as by-products of the Internet: infomediaries and metamediaries. Infomediaries, such as [[Google]] and [[Yahoo]], are [[search engine]] companies that also function as brokers, or middlemen, in the business marketing world. They charge companies fees to find information on the Web as well as for banner and [[pop-up ad]]s and search engine optimization services. Metamediaries are companies with robust Internet sites that furnish customers with multiproduct, multivendor and multiservice marketspace in return for commissions on sales.\n\nWith the advent of b-to-b exchanges, the Internet ushered in an enthusiasm for collaboration that never existed before\u2014and in fact might have even seemed ludicrous 10 years ago. For example, a decade ago who would have imagined Ford, [[General Motors]] and [[DaimlerChrysler]] entering into a joint venture? That's exactly what happened after all three of [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|the Big Three]] began moving their purchases online in the late 1990s. All three companies were pursuing their own initiatives when they realized the [[Returns to scale|economies of scale]] they could achieve by pooling their efforts. Thus was born what then was the world's largest [[Dot-com company|Internet business]] when Ford's Auto-Xchange and GM's TradeXchange merged, with DaimlerChrysler representing the third partner.\n\nWhile this exchange did not stand the test of time, others have, including [[Agentrics]], which was formed in 2005 with the merger of WorldWide Retail Exchange and GlobalNetXchange, or GNX. Agentrics serves more 50 retailers around the world and more than 300 customers, and its members have combined sales of about $1 trillion. Hutt and Speh (2001) note that such virtual marketplaces enable companies and their suppliers to conduct business in real time as well as simplify purchase processes and cut costs.\n\n== Design ==\n\nB2B design often relies heavily on gradients. This is seen by some to represent the fluid nature of the sector and the democratic approach to design employed by B2B agencies.\n<ref>https://www.xmple.com/wallpaper/gradient-purple-blue-linear-5120x2880-c2-9400d3-00ced1-a-345-f-14.svg</ref>\n\n== References ==\n* Anderson, James C., and Narus, James A.

Firstly, before a formulated product can be developed for market, the active substance must be approved for the European Union. After this has been achieved, authorisation for the specific product must be sought from every Member State that the applicant wants to sell it to. Afterwards, there is a monitoring programme to make sure the pesticide residues in food are below the limits set by the [[European Food Safety Authority]]. Although diquat was used in many European countries from the 1960s, an EU directive has removed its approval for any use, effective from 12 October 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1539769311671&uri=CELEX:32018R1532 |title=Non-renewal of approval of diquat |publisher=EUR-Lex |access-date=2020-02-02 }}</ref>\n[[File:Diquat use in the USA in 2016.png |thumb |Estimated use of diquat in US agriculture in 2016]]\nDiquat is an unusual herbicide because it is often not used for weed control but is instead applied directly on mature crops. This causes desiccation, making the crop easier to harvest, particularly with mechanised equipment. The advantage to the farmer can be to advance the harvesting date, reduce the time taken to harvest and, in the case of seed crops, reduce the moisture content of the seed and increase its useful yield.<ref name=JH50 /> Farmers can act in their best economic interest: the value of these benefits can be estimated and the total cost of using the herbicide, including the cost, for example of aerial spraying, informs the decision to purchase. This [[Cost\u2013benefit analysis|cost-benefit ]] analysis by the end user sets a maximum price which the supplier can demand. When used as a conventional herbicide for weed control, diquat must be applied after the weeds have emerged since it is only effective on contact with green tissue. In this use it is fast-acting in sunlight and more effective on broadleaved weeds than grasses.<ref name=PMIP >{{cite web |url=http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/herb-growthreg/dalapon-ethephon/diquat/diquat_prf_0385.html |title=diquat dibromide |author=Pesticide Management Information Program |access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10750-010-0423-4 |title=Optimising diquat use for submerged aquatic weed management |journal=Hydrobiologia |volume=656 |pages=159\u2013165 |year=2010 |last1=Clayton |first1=John |last2=Matheson |first2=Fleur }}</ref> Mixing of diquat with other herbicides is also feasible.<ref name=USlabel /> The estimated annual use of diquat in US agriculture is mapped by the US Geological Service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/show_map.php?year=2016&map=DIQUAT&hilo=L&disp=Diquat |title=Estimated Agricultural Use for diquat in the USA, 2016 |author=US Geological Survey |access-date=2020-02-15 }}</ref>\n\n== Human safety ==\nDiquat dibromide is moderately toxic.

These names are not the exclusive property of the holder of any patent or [[trademark]] and as such they are the easiest way for non-experts to refer to individual chemicals. Companies selling pesticides normally do so using a brand name or [[wordmark]] which allows them to distinguish their product from competitor products having the same active ingredient. In many cases, this branding is country and formulation-specific so after several years of sales there can be multiple brand names for a given active ingredient. The situation is made even more complicated when companies license their ingredients to others, as is often done. The licensee will normally wish to create their own set of trademarks for use in advertising and to promote to their customers.

Firstly, before a formulated product can be developed for market, the active substance must be approved for the European Union. After this has been achieved, authorisation for the specific product must be sought from every Member State that the applicant wants to sell it to. Afterwards, there is a monitoring programme to make sure the pesticide residues in food are below the limits set by the [[European Food Safety Authority]]. Although diquat was used in many European countries from the 1960s, an EU directive has removed its approval for any use, effective from 12 October 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1539769311671&uri=CELEX:32018R1532 |title=Non-renewal of approval of diquat |publisher=EUR-Lex |access-date=2020-02-02 }}</ref>\n[[File:Diquat use in the USA in 2016.png |thumb |Estimated use of diquat in US agriculture in 2016]]\nDiquat is an unusual herbicide because it is often not used for weed control but is instead applied directly on mature crops. This causes desiccation, making the crop easier to harvest, particularly with mechanised equipment. The advantage to the farmer can be to advance the harvesting date, reduce the time taken to harvest and, in the case of seed crops, reduce the moisture content of the seed and increase its useful yield.<ref name=JH50 /> Farmers can act in their best economic interest: the value of these benefits can be estimated and the total cost of using the herbicide, including the cost, for example of aerial spraying, informs the decision to purchase. This [[Cost\u2013benefit analysis|cost-benefit ]] analysis by the end user sets a maximum price which the supplier can demand. When used as a conventional herbicide for weed control, diquat must be applied after the weeds have emerged since it is only effective on contact with green tissue. In this use it is fast-acting in sunlight and more effective on broadleaved weeds than grasses.<ref name=PMIP >{{cite web |url=http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/herb-growthreg/dalapon-ethephon/diquat/diquat_prf_0385.html |title=diquat dibromide |author=Pesticide Management Information Program |access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10750-010-0423-4 |title=Optimising diquat use for submerged aquatic weed management |journal=Hydrobiologia |volume=656 |pages=159\u2013165 |year=2010 |last1=Clayton |first1=John |last2=Matheson |first2=Fleur }}</ref> Mixing of diquat with other herbicides is also feasible.<ref name=USlabel /> The estimated annual use of diquat in US agriculture is mapped by the US Geological Service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/show_map.php?year=2016&map=DIQUAT&hilo=L&disp=Diquat |title=Estimated Agricultural Use for diquat in the USA, 2016 |author=US Geological Survey |access-date=2020-02-15 }}</ref>\n\n== Human safety ==\nDiquat dibromide is moderately toxic.

These names are not the exclusive property of the holder of any patent or [[trademark]] and as such they are the easiest way for non-experts to refer to individual chemicals. Companies selling pesticides normally do so using a brand name or [[wordmark]] which allows them to distinguish their product from competitor products having the same active ingredient. In many cases, this branding is country and formulation-specific so after several years of sales there can be multiple brand names for a given active ingredient. The situation is made even more complicated when companies license their ingredients to others, as is often done. The licensee will normally wish to create their own set of trademarks for use in advertising and to promote to their customers. In addition, they may intend to mix the licensed product with their own proprietary materials and would certainly create a new brand for these mixtures.\nIt is therefore difficult to provide a comprehensive list of brand names for products containing diquat in its many salt and ester forms.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to [[North American Rockwell]], the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

Rockwell conducted structural tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effect of aerodynamic stresses.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech.

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\nFour operational OVs were originally built. Following the construction of ''Columbia'' (OV-102) and the conversion of ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' (OV-099) to a flyable spacecraft, ''Discovery'' (OV-103) and ''Atlantis'' (OV-104) were ordered in January 1979. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]] in January 1986, NASA ordered a fifth OV, ''Endeavour'' (OV-105) in July 1987.

The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after [[STS-4]] and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting [[extravehicular activity]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to [[North American Rockwell]], the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

Rockwell conducted structural tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effect of aerodynamic stresses.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech.

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\nFour operational OVs were originally built. Following the construction of ''Columbia'' (OV-102) and the conversion of ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' (OV-099) to a flyable spacecraft, ''Discovery'' (OV-103) and ''Atlantis'' (OV-104) were ordered in January 1979. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]] in January 1986, NASA ordered a fifth OV, ''Endeavour'' (OV-105) in July 1987.

The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after [[STS-4]] and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting [[extravehicular activity]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

Missions after [[STS-38]] used the RS-25 engines to achieve the optimal apogee, and used the OMS engines to circularize the orbit. The orbital altitude and inclination were mission dependent, and the Space Shuttle's orbits varied from 120 NM to 335 NM.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III\u201310}}\n\n===In orbit===\n[[File:Endeavour docked to ISS.jpg|thumb|right|''Endeavour'' docked at ISS]]\n\nThe type of mission that the Space Shuttle was assigned to dictated the type of orbit that it entered.  The initial design of the reusable Space Shuttle envisioned an increasingly cheap launch platform to deploy commercial and government satellites. Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]]. While later missions still launched commercial payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely directed towards scientific payloads, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], Spacelab, and the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]].  Beginning with [[STS-74]], the orbiter vehicle conducted dockings with the [[Mir space station]].  In its final decade of operation, the Space Shuttle was used for the construction of the [[International Space Station]].<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III\u2013108, 123, 224, 264}} Most missions involved staying in orbit several days to two weeks, although longer missions were possible with the [[Extended Duration Orbiter]] pallet.

The orbiter vehicle reoriented itself to a nose-forward position with a 40\u00b0 angle-of-attack, and the forward RCS jets were emptied of fuel and disabled prior to reentry. The orbiter vehicle's reentry was defined as starting at an altitude {{convert|400000|ft|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, when it was traveling approximately Mach 25.  The orbiter vehicle's reentry was controlled by the GPCs, which followed a preset angle-of-attack plan to prevent unsafe heating of the TPS.

If '''A''' is ''n''-by-''n'', '''B''' is ''m''-by-''m'' and   <math>\\mathbf{I}_k</math> denotes the ''k''-by-''k'' identity matrix then the Kronecker sum is defined by:\n:<math> \\mathbf{A} \\oplus \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{A} \\otimes \\mathbf{I}_m + \\mathbf{I}_n \\otimes \\mathbf{B}. </math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Matrix multiplication]]\n* [[Vector addition]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |title=Linear Algebra |first1=S. |last1=Lipschutz |first2=M. |last2=Lipson |series=Schaum's Outline Series |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-07-154352-1}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{PlanetMath |urlname=DirectSumOfMatrices |title= Direct sum of matrices}}\n* [http://drexel28.wordpress.com/2010/12/22/direct-sum-of-linear-transformations-and-direct-sum-of-matrices-pt-iii/ Abstract nonsense: Direct Sum of Linear Transformations and Direct Sum of Matrices]\n* [http://www.mymathlib.com/matrices/arithmetic/direct_sum.html Mathematics Source Library: Arithmetic Matrix Operations]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120514184901/http://www.aps.uoguelph.ca/~lrs/ABMethods/NOTES/CDmatrix.pdf Matrix Algebra and R]\n\n[[Category:Linear algebra]]\n[[Category:Binary operations]]\n", "name_user": "Trang Oul", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eKronecker sum", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_addition"}

The artist traveled around Canada for inspiration in order to challenge the core definition of reality through disarranging objects from the precise manner.<ref name=\":1\" /> She mimics the environment around her and expresses it through bold colours and contour of shapes.<ref name=\":1\" /> McGillivray's artistic style stressed the \"abstract qualities of lines, shapes and forms\"<ref name=\":1\" /> that was expressed in her work through large amount of paint applied by a palette knife in her oil paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> Working with the outdoors, the painter developed a powerful style that defined her career as a contemporary artist.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHer inspiration derived from various environments<ref name=\":1\" /> including journeying through her hometown in Whitby, Gatineau Valley <ref name=\":0\" /> and her voyage through Eastern Canada, including Newfoundland, Trinidad, Jamaica, Bahama Islands in the West Indies, Alaska, Eastern United States, Western Canada, Venice, Italy and the Swiss Alps.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> The painter was seen as a contemporary artist working with several media which includes watercolour, pastel and oil.<ref name=\":1\" /> During her trip to Europe, she had encountered newly forming art styles of Symbolism and Post Impressionism that impacted and influenced her art.  Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children.

McGillivray Canadian, 1864 - 1938 oil on canvas 46.7 x 61.6&nbsp;cm Purchased 1926 National Gallery of Canada (no. 3352)]]\n\nMcGillivray artworks were heavily influenced by the organic elements of nature that engulf her artistic skills. The artists traveled around Canada for inspiration in order to challenge the core definition of reality through disarranging objects from the precise manner.<ref name=\":1\" /> She mimics the environment around her and expresses it through bold colours and contour of shapes.<ref name=\":1\" /> Florence's artistic style stressed the \"abstract qualities of lines, shapes and forms\"<ref name=\":1\" /> that was expressed in her work through large amount of paint applied by a palette knife in her oil paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> Working with the outdoors, the painter developed a unique style that defined her career as a contemporary artist.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHer inspiration derived from various environments<ref name=\":1\" /> including journeying through her hometown in Whitby, Gatineau Valley <ref name=\":0\" /> and her voyage through Eastern Canada, including Newfoundland, Trinidad, Jamaica, Bahama Islands in the West Indies, Alaska, Eastern United States, Western Canada, Venice, Italy and the Swiss Alps.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> The painter was seen as a contemporary artist working with several media which includes watercolour, pastel and oil.<ref name=\":1\" /> During her trip to Europe, she had encountered newly forming art styles of Symbolism and Post Impressionism that impacted and influenced her art.  Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* Art Gallery of Ontario. \"The Canadian Collection.\" ''Art Gallery of Ontario'', 288-289.

He became interested in rock music after hearing [[The Residents]], and formed a band with school friends. He has written and recorded as '''The Legend!'''\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1982, he went to a gig by The Laughing Apple and met the group's lead singer [[Alan McGee]].  According to McGee: \"there used to be this guy who'd stand at the front of all the gigs and dance disjointedly\". They became friends and when McGee started the Communication Blur club, he offered Thackray the role of comp\u0117re, stating that Thackray \"was the most un-enigmatic, boring, kindest, shyest person you could ever meet \u2013 and it just appealed to my sense of humour to make him comp\u00e8re.\"<ref name=\"Dee\">Dee, Johnny (1988) \"It's Different For Domeheads: Alan McGee recalls the most memorable Creation creations\", ''Underground'', April 1988 \u2013 issue 13, p. 28</ref> He was originally billed as \"the legendary Jerry Thackray\", eventually shortened to simply \"The Legend\".<ref name=\"Dee\" /> McGee also offered him a column in his new [[fanzine]], also called ''Communication Blur'', but Thackray left after two issues, because he objected to McGee's proposal to put a [[flexidisc]] of [[The Smiths]] on the front cover.  He instead started his own [[zine]], ''The Legend!'', under which name he recorded the single \"73 in 83\", the first to be released by McGee's [[Creation Records]].<ref name=\"creation\">[http://www.creationrecords.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/legend.htm Creation Records: The Legend!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120091858/http://www.creationrecords.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/legend.htm |date=20 November 2007 }}</ref> In 1984, he released a second single, \"Legend Destroys the Blues\", but his performing career did not take off.  He puts this down to the fact that he \"didn't like to perform a song more than once\", although he has continued to make occasional appearances.<ref>Matthew Fritch, [http://www.magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html Magnet Magazine: Everett True] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030617162627/http://magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html |date=17 June 2003 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Thackray began working at the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]''.  In 1988, he was sacked from the paper, and instead took a job at its rival, ''[[Melody Maker]]''. He was told to adopt a new pseudonym, as the \"Legend!\" name was too closely associated with the ''NME''. He chose \"Everett True\", from the early twentieth century cartoon ''[[The Outbursts of Everett True]]''.<ref>[http://www.poptones.co.uk/index.php?/questions_of_doom/more/everett_true/ Poptones: Questions of Doom \u2013 Everett True] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824010412/http://www.poptones.co.uk/index.php?%2Fquestions_of_doom%2Fmore%2Feverett_true%2F |date=24 August 2006 }}</ref>\n\nWithin months, he was sent to [[Seattle]] to cover the emerging [[grunge]] scene.  He helped to publicise the music and befriended many of the bands. In 1989, as The Legend!, he performed guest vocals on a single with [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]] and [[Tobi Vail]]'s band [[The Go Team]]. In 1991, he introduced [[Kurt Cobain]] to [[Courtney Love]] at a [[Butthole Surfers]] and [[L7 (band)|L7]] gig.  The three became close friends, and, in 1992, True wheeled Cobain on stage at the [[Reading Festival]].<ref name=\"creation\" /> In 2006, True published ''Nirvana: The True Story'', a book about his personal relationship with the band and the [[grunge]] scene.<ref>Omnibus Press, 2006, reprinted as ''Nirvana: The Biography'' by Da Capo Press, 2007</ref>\n\nDuring his time on the weeklies, True became one of the United Kingdom's most controversial music journalists \u2013 some appreciated his enthusiastic tone, while others were bored and irritated by the narcissistic, self-serving nature of his work.\n\nIn the early 1990s, True lived in [[Brighton]], East Sussex, with members of the band [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], introduced them to the nascent [[Riot Grrrl]] movement in the United States and became one of the foremost proselytisers of riot grrrl in both countries.\n\nLeaving MM in the late 1990s, he became editor of ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'', reverting on this occasion to his real name. It has been claimed that the band [[theaudience]] were formed after founder member [[Billy Reeves]] bet True \u00a3100 that he could form a band and get it signed.<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/sophology/biography.htm Soph-ology: a Sophie Ellis Bextor fansite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523133505/http://www.freewebs.com/sophology/biography.htm |date=23 May 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, True returned to Seattle, where he worked for a year as music editor for ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]],''<ref>[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=10144 The Stranger Timeline]</ref> before heading for Australia, where he freelanced at Melbourne broadsheet, ''[[The Age]]''. He also recorded an album under the name The Legend!, featuring well-known Hobart guitarist and personality Julian Teakle. Back again in the United Kingdom, he set up the magazine ''[[Careless Talk Costs Lives (magazine)|Careless Talk Costs Lives]]'' in 2002.

He has also contributed to many magazines and newspapers, and has written many books, including ones on the [[Ramones]], [[The White Stripes]], as well as an account of his time with Nirvana. In 2008, he relocated with his family to Brisbane in Australia, apparently on a whim: \"It was a nice day when we stepped off the plane,\" he told several interviewers.

He became interested in rock music after hearing [[The Residents]], and formed a band with school friends. He has written and recorded as '''The Legend!'''\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1982, he went to a gig by The Laughing Apple and met the group's lead singer [[Alan McGee]].  According to McGee: \"there used to be this guy who'd stand at the front of all the gigs and dance disjointedly\". They became friends and when McGee started the Communication Blur club, he offered Thackray the role of comp\u0117re, stating that Thackray \"was the most un-enigmatic, boring, kindest, shyest person you could ever meet \u2013 and it just appealed to my sense of humour to make him comp\u00e8re.\"<ref name=\"Dee\">Dee, Johnny (1988) \"It's Different For Domeheads: Alan McGee recalls the most memorable Creation creations\", ''Underground'', April 1988 \u2013 issue 13, p. 28</ref> He was originally billed as \"the legendary Jerry Thackray\", eventually shortened to simply \"The Legend\".<ref name=\"Dee\" /> McGee also offered him a column in his new [[fanzine]], also called ''Communication Blur'', but Thackray left after two issues, because he objected to McGee's proposal to put a [[flexidisc]] of [[The Smiths]] on the front cover.  He instead started his own [[zine]], ''The Legend!'', under which name he recorded the single \"73 in 83\", the first to be released by McGee's [[Creation Records]].<ref name=\"creation\">[http://www.creationrecords.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/legend.htm Creation Records: The Legend!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120091858/http://www.creationrecords.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/legend.htm |date=20 November 2007 }}</ref> In 1984, he released a second single, \"Legend Destroys the Blues\", but his performing career did not take off.  He puts this down to the fact that he \"didn't like to perform a song more than once\", although he has continued to make occasional appearances.<ref>Matthew Fritch, [http://www.magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html Magnet Magazine: Everett True] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030617162627/http://magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html |date=17 June 2003 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Thackray began working at the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]''.  In 1988, he was sacked from the paper, and instead took a job at its rival, ''[[Melody Maker]]''. He was told to adopt a new pseudonym, as the \"Legend!\" name was too closely associated with the ''NME''. He chose \"Everett True\", from the early twentieth century cartoon ''[[The Outbursts of Everett True]]''.<ref>[http://www.poptones.co.uk/index.php?/questions_of_doom/more/everett_true/ Poptones: Questions of Doom \u2013 Everett True] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824010412/http://www.poptones.co.uk/index.php?%2Fquestions_of_doom%2Fmore%2Feverett_true%2F |date=24 August 2006 }}</ref>\n\nWithin months, he was sent to [[Seattle]] to cover the emerging [[grunge]] scene.  He helped to publicise the music and befriended many of the bands. In 1989, as The Legend!, he performed guest vocals on a single with [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]] and [[Tobi Vail]]'s band [[The Go Team]]. In 1991, he introduced [[Kurt Cobain]] to [[Courtney Love]] at a [[Butthole Surfers]] and [[L7 (band)|L7]] gig.  The three became close friends, and, in 1992, True wheeled Cobain on stage at the [[Reading Festival]].<ref name=\"creation\" /> In 2006, True published ''Nirvana: The True Story'', a book about his personal relationship with the band and the [[grunge]] scene.<ref>Omnibus Press, 2006, reprinted as ''Nirvana: The Biography'' by Da Capo Press, 2007</ref>\n\nDuring his time on the weeklies, True became one of the United Kingdom's most controversial music journalists \u2013 some appreciated his enthusiastic tone, while others were bored and irritated by the narcissistic, self-serving nature of his work.\n\nIn the early 1990s, True lived in [[Brighton]], East Sussex, with members of the band [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], introduced them to the nascent [[Riot Grrrl]] movement in the United States and became one of the foremost proselytisers of riot grrrl in both countries.\n\nLeaving MM in the late 1990s, he became editor of ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'', reverting on this occasion to his real name. It has been claimed that the band [[theaudience]] were formed after founder member [[Billy Reeves]] bet True \u00a3100 that he could form a band and get it signed.<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/sophology/biography.htm Soph-ology: a Sophie Ellis Bextor fansite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523133505/http://www.freewebs.com/sophology/biography.htm |date=23 May 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, True returned to Seattle, where he worked for a year as music editor for ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]],''<ref>[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=10144 The Stranger Timeline]</ref> before heading for Australia, where he freelanced at Melbourne broadsheet, ''[[The Age]]''. He also recorded an album under the name The Legend!, featuring well-known Hobart guitarist and personality Julian Teakle. Back again in the United Kingdom, he set up the magazine ''[[Careless Talk Costs Lives (magazine)|Careless Talk Costs Lives]]'' in 2002. Issues of this publication began at No. 12 and counted down, claiming that \"we have set out to replace the decaying music press in Britain, so by issue zero we will either have achieved our objectives or given up trying\".<ref>[http://www.digitalhardcore.com/artist_bio.asp?Artist_ID=92 Digital Hardcore: Careless Talk Costs Lives \u2013 Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901154425/http://www.digitalhardcore.com/artist_bio.asp?Artist_ID=92 |date=1 September 2006 }}</ref> By the twelfth issue (#1), it was clear that it would not achieve its ambitions, and True instead founded ''[[Plan B (magazine)|Plan B]]''.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2009, True helped oversee ''Plan B'' alongside others, notably Frances Morgan, Chris Houghton and designer Andrew Clare. He has also contributed to many magazines and newspapers, and has written many books, including ones on the [[Ramones]], [[The White Stripes]], as well as an account of his time with Nirvana. In 2008, he relocated with his family to Brisbane in Australia, apparently on a whim: \"It was a nice day when we stepped off the plane,\" he told several interviewers.

His off the cuff answer was: <blockquote>I hope to see a country where families are strong. Where we've incentivised families through the policies that we've legislated. I hope to see a strong defence force so that we can weather the challenges that will inevitably come. If you take history as a guide we will face inevitable security challenges.

He supported the postal survey because he believed that the institution of marriage, since it existed before the parliament, was an institution that belonged to people, so it was right for the people themselves to vote on it. When the \"yes vote\" was strongly returned, Hastie ensured passage of the bill, but could not vote for it himself. He explained, \"We went to the election with it, I was on television saying I would abstain, I've been in dialogue with constituents for the last 18 months and whenever I've talked to them about the issue, I've said I would abstain. My intention is to abstain because to vote yes would go against my conscience, but I want to uphold both the vote in Canning and the national result and abstention is the best way to do that.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/5058727/hastie-to-abstain-on-yes-vote/|title=Hastie to abstain on 'yes' vote|last=Hondros|first=Nathan|date=2017-11-15|website=Mandurah Mail|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> Most of Hastie's statements through the public debate centred not on marriage, but on how to have the debate. When right wing commentators such as Larry Pickering used homophobic language towards [[LGBT]] persons, Hastie immediately condemned the statement, expressing his \"dismay\" at the degrading language, and pleaded for \"higher personal and civic standards\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/pickering-comments-despicable-hastie|title=Pickering comments despicable: Hastie|website=SBS News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of conscience - on military abuses ====\nRecent reports by Chris Masters and others of prisoner abuse, and even killings, by the Australian [[Special Air Service Regiment]] in Afghanistan have seen Hastie come forward as a strong advocate for transparency, though it may hurt the prestige of his former unit. He has \"emerged as a champion of the Brereton Inquiry.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/he-thought-i-was-going-to-shoot-him-how-david-s-little-voice-saved-him-in-war-20190913-p52qy6.html|title='He thought I was going to shoot him': How David's 'little voice' saved him in war|last=Masters|first=Nick McKenzie, Chris|date=2019-09-20|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> He strongly supports whistleblowers when it comes to abuse, telling ABC Radio the truth tellers should be respected: \"I don't want to go into any specific allegations, but they should be taken seriously and, as I said, we want a free media reporting on all issues.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/secretive-and-elite-sas-soldiers-grilled-about-alleged-war-crimes-20180608-p4zkau.html|title=Secretive and elite SAS soldiers grilled about alleged war crimes|last=Wroe|first=Nick McKenzie, David|date=2018-06-08|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of expression ====\nIn one of Hastie's first electoral campaigns, he had a large outdoor poster vandalised. Rather than condemn the culprit, he wrote a Facebook message, \"Will Mandurah's Van Gogh please come forward<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/3985723/hasties-spray-mp-responds-to-graffiti-attack/|title=Hastie's spray: MP responds to graffiti attack|last=Hondros|first=Nathan|date=2016-06-22|website=Mandurah Mail|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> then had a local graffiti artist add even more colour to the piece.

He has actively stood up for journalists at the ABC and [[Sydney morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]], using Parliamentary privilege to name Chau Chak Wing as a man who co-conspired to bribe a UN official, a man who took the media outlets to court for defamation as they had published the accusations. Hastie explained his actions by saying \"...democracy works only if we have a free press that can publish information that serves the public interest.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-23/turnbull-did-not-know-hastie-would-make-chau-chak-wing-claims/9790476|title=Liberal MP says he did his duty in speaking up about political donor|last=Yaxley|first=political reporters Louise|last2=Gribbin|first2=Caitlyn|date=2018-05-23|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18|last3=Conifer|first3=Dan}}</ref> However, current laws have allowed for the Australian Federal Police to raid journalists from the ABC and News Corp Australia for reasons of security. This places a tension between freedom and sovereignty.\n\n==== Freedom of religion ====\nWhile an observant Christian, Hastie holds to the view that if the law allows him to practice his faith, it must allow all to express their faith, or lack of it. That means that traditional Muslim families must be allowed to have women wear the burka in public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-02/keeping-the-faith-andrew-hastie/8477382|title=Andrew Hastie on poetry, political courage, and not banning the burka|last=Alexandra Beech|date=2017-05-02|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Sovereignty ===\n[[File:Andrew Hastie MP with Mayor Rhys Williams at March 2020 Citizenship Ceremony in Mandurah photo taken by D Birch.jpg|thumb|The Mayor of Mandurah, Rhys Williams, with Andrew Hastie MP, hosting an Australian Citizenship ceremony in March 2020]]\nHastie has argued that only Australia should make decisions that affect Australia's future or the working of our institutions. As such he strongly resists foreign influence on the working of the Australian economy, culture or political system. \"My bottom line is Australian sovereignty \u2013 I want to protect our way of life, our freedom of action and our political institutions. That's my job as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. I make no apologies for it.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-a-dead-spy-chinese-hackers-and-the-australian-commando-warning-israel-1.8223349|title=A Dead Spy, Chinese Hackers and the Australian Commando Warning Israel|date=2019-12-06|work=Haaretz|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Economic sovereignty ====\nInterestingly, Hastie locates the energy debates within the concern for Australian sovereignty, and it was this issue that meant he could never support the [[National Energy Guarantee]]. In August 2018, he posted his position: \"My priority is Australia's economic sovereignty and affordable power prices. Here I stand.\" The next month he made a speech in the Federation Chamber, saying, \"Australian industry and Australian workers must come first. When it comes to energy, we must put the Australian people before Paris.\"\n\n==== Sovereignty and political warfare ====\nThis has been the main legislative focus for Hastie in recent times. In an interview with the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'', Hastie explained that, \"Democratic countries must take domestic measures to protect against these threats. Australia has led the way in this regard. Authoritarian states use all instruments of state power to pursue their strategic objectives. Seemingly innocent activities like diplomacy, foreign-investment flows into strategic industries and infrastructure acquisitions like the purchase of ports are not so innocuous. Democracies who don't pay attention to these activities \u2013 and take measures to guard against them \u2013 risk becoming tethered to hyper-modern authoritarian states and losing their sovereignty in the process.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/>\n\n==== Digital sovereignty ====\nHastie frames questions to do with the provision of information networks as a matter of sovereignty, which must be defended. Given that companies such as Huawei would be legally required to pass on information carried on their networks to the Chinese government,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/05/huawei-would-have-to-give-data-to-china-government-if-asked-experts.html|title=Huawei says it would never hand data to China's government.

Along with other parliamentarians from the Liberal Party, including [[Tim Wilson (Australian politician)|Tim Wilson]] and [[James Paterson (Australian politician)|James Paterson]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor's]] [[Kimberley Kitching]] and [[Anthony Byrne (politician)|Anthony Byrne]], he has been active in applying pressure to Australia's partners in the [[Five Eyes]] security alliance to do the same. In a public statement he explained how important that security arrangement is, \"In a time of growing strategic uncertainty, Australia values that membership more than ever.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/four-australian-mps-urge-britain-to-ban-huawei-20200124-p53u9x.html|title=Four Australian MPs urge Britain to ban Huawei|last=Bourke|first=Latika|date=2020-01-23|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> In private settings, it is known that he has supported Byrne, the Deputy Chair of the committee Hastie leads, who used forceful language with the UK leadership, asking \u201cHow would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks?

In an interview about his wartime experiences, he said:<blockquote> For me, it proved that culture and geography (are) decisive in the formation of societies and political institutions. Building lasting, trusted institutions takes time, generations of stewardship and public virtue.<ref name=\"Whinnett\"/></blockquote> Looking at Australia, Hastie believes that it is local institutions that provide civic foundations of \"accountability, freedom and democracy.\"<ref name=\"First Speech\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrewhastie.com.au/first_speech|title=First Speech|website=Andrew Hastie MP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> He argued in his first speech that the first of these institutions is the family, which \"is central to a healthy society\"<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> but also extends to sporting clubs, service clubs, churches and local businesses.<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> In one op-ed, Hastie went even further, suggesting that community groups, or \"pre-political institutions\" are finally more important than governments:<blockquote> \"More powerful than the political levers of government are grassroots volunteer movements and pre-political institutions... Pre-political institutions are the best place for securing our freedoms and so we should take encouragement that democratic governments cannot control them, and are sent packing when they attempt to do so.\"<ref name=\"theaustralian.com.au\">{{Cite news|last=Hastie|first=Andrew|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/opinion/political-class-ignored-the-people-and-paid-the-price/news-story/f1d35ad7c29f76daf08768182b316d55|title=Political class ignored the people and paid the price|date=November 23, 2016|work=The Australian|access-date=February 12, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== The power of community and PTSD ====\nHastie reflected on how his grandfather recovered from the trauma of [[World War II]] thanks, in part to the power of community, and laments that we may not have that power available to us now, \"Just thinking of my grandfather's own experience, he was shot up quite badly in the second world war where civil society was still very strong, community was still very strong, a lot of local clubs and organisations, I think he struggled with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] but I think his PTSD was mitigated by those little platoons that we talk about, he was very close to his comrades from the second war, and I'm just not sure if we have in today's society that same sort of cushioning and community support as we had 70 years ago.\"<ref name=\"Grattan\"/>\n\n==== Community and environment ====\nWhile environmental concern is often seen as a progressive cause, Hastie sets the environment between two concerns - that, as per the [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] contract - the good things inherited should be passed on to the next generation. And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

His off the cuff answer was: <blockquote>I hope to see a country where families are strong. Where we've incentivised families through the policies that we've legislated. I hope to see a strong defence force so that we can weather the challenges that will inevitably come. If you take history as a guide we will face inevitable security challenges.

He supported the postal survey because he believed that the institution of marriage, since it existed before the parliament, was an institution that belonged to people, so it was right for the people themselves to vote on it. When the \"yes vote\" was strongly returned, Hastie ensured passage of the bill, but could not vote for it himself. He explained, \"We went to the election with it, I was on television saying I would abstain, I've been in dialogue with constituents for the last 18 months and whenever I've talked to them about the issue, I've said I would abstain. My intention is to abstain because to vote yes would go against my conscience, but I want to uphold both the vote in Canning and the national result and abstention is the best way to do that.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/5058727/hastie-to-abstain-on-yes-vote/|title=Hastie to abstain on 'yes' vote|last=Hondros|first=Nathan|date=2017-11-15|website=Mandurah Mail|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> Most of Hastie's statements through the public debate centred not on marriage, but on how to have the debate. When right wing commentators such as Larry Pickering used homophobic language towards [[LGBT]] persons, Hastie immediately condemned the statement, expressing his \"dismay\" at the degrading language, and pleaded for \"higher personal and civic standards\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/pickering-comments-despicable-hastie|title=Pickering comments despicable: Hastie|website=SBS News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of conscience - on military abuses ====\nRecent reports by Chris Masters and others of prisoner abuse, and even killings, by the Australian [[Special Air Service Regiment]] in Afghanistan have seen Hastie come forward as a strong advocate for transparency, though it may hurt the prestige of his former unit. He has \"emerged as a champion of the Brereton Inquiry.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/he-thought-i-was-going-to-shoot-him-how-david-s-little-voice-saved-him-in-war-20190913-p52qy6.html|title='He thought I was going to shoot him': How David's 'little voice' saved him in war|last=Masters|first=Nick McKenzie, Chris|date=2019-09-20|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> He strongly supports whistleblowers when it comes to abuse, telling ABC Radio the truth tellers should be respected: \"I don't want to go into any specific allegations, but they should be taken seriously and, as I said, we want a free media reporting on all issues.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/secretive-and-elite-sas-soldiers-grilled-about-alleged-war-crimes-20180608-p4zkau.html|title=Secretive and elite SAS soldiers grilled about alleged war crimes|last=Wroe|first=Nick McKenzie, David|date=2018-06-08|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of expression ====\nIn one of Hastie's first electoral campaigns, he had a large outdoor poster vandalised. Rather than condemn the culprit, he wrote a Facebook message, \"Will Mandurah's Van Gogh please come forward<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/3985723/hasties-spray-mp-responds-to-graffiti-attack/|title=Hastie's spray: MP responds to graffiti attack|last=Hondros|first=Nathan|date=2016-06-22|website=Mandurah Mail|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> then had a local graffiti artist add even more colour to the piece.

He has actively stood up for journalists at the ABC and [[Sydney morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]], using Parliamentary privilege to name Chau Chak Wing as a man who co-conspired to bribe a UN official, a man who took the media outlets to court for defamation as they had published the accusations. Hastie explained his actions by saying \"...democracy works only if we have a free press that can publish information that serves the public interest.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-23/turnbull-did-not-know-hastie-would-make-chau-chak-wing-claims/9790476|title=Liberal MP says he did his duty in speaking up about political donor|last=Yaxley|first=political reporters Louise|last2=Gribbin|first2=Caitlyn|date=2018-05-23|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18|last3=Conifer|first3=Dan}}</ref> However, current laws have allowed for the Australian Federal Police to raid journalists from the ABC and News Corp Australia for reasons of security. This places a tension between freedom and sovereignty.\n\n==== Freedom of religion ====\nWhile an observant Christian, Hastie holds to the view that if the law allows him to practice his faith, it must allow all to express their faith, or lack of it. That means that traditional Muslim families must be allowed to have women wear the burka in public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-02/keeping-the-faith-andrew-hastie/8477382|title=Andrew Hastie on poetry, political courage, and not banning the burka|last=Alexandra Beech|date=2017-05-02|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Sovereignty ===\n[[File:Andrew Hastie MP with Mayor Rhys Williams at March 2020 Citizenship Ceremony in Mandurah photo taken by D Birch.jpg|thumb|The Mayor of Mandurah, Rhys Williams, with Andrew Hastie MP, hosting an Australian Citizenship ceremony in March 2020]]\nHastie has argued that only Australia should make decisions that affect Australia's future or the working of our institutions. As such he strongly resists foreign influence on the working of the Australian economy, culture or political system. \"My bottom line is Australian sovereignty \u2013 I want to protect our way of life, our freedom of action and our political institutions. That's my job as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. I make no apologies for it.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-a-dead-spy-chinese-hackers-and-the-australian-commando-warning-israel-1.8223349|title=A Dead Spy, Chinese Hackers and the Australian Commando Warning Israel|date=2019-12-06|work=Haaretz|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Economic sovereignty ====\nInterestingly, Hastie locates the energy debates within the concern for Australian sovereignty, and it was this issue that meant he could never support the [[National Energy Guarantee]]. In August 2018, he posted his position: \"My priority is Australia's economic sovereignty and affordable power prices. Here I stand.\" The next month he made a speech in the Federation Chamber, saying, \"Australian industry and Australian workers must come first. When it comes to energy, we must put the Australian people before Paris.\"\n\n==== Sovereignty and political warfare ====\nThis has been the main legislative focus for Hastie in recent times. In an interview with the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'', Hastie explained that, \"Democratic countries must take domestic measures to protect against these threats. Australia has led the way in this regard. Authoritarian states use all instruments of state power to pursue their strategic objectives. Seemingly innocent activities like diplomacy, foreign-investment flows into strategic industries and infrastructure acquisitions like the purchase of ports are not so innocuous. Democracies who don't pay attention to these activities \u2013 and take measures to guard against them \u2013 risk becoming tethered to hyper-modern authoritarian states and losing their sovereignty in the process.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/>\n\n==== Digital sovereignty ====\nHastie frames questions to do with the provision of information networks as a matter of sovereignty, which must be defended. Given that companies such as Huawei would be legally required to pass on information carried on their networks to the Chinese government,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/05/huawei-would-have-to-give-data-to-china-government-if-asked-experts.html|title=Huawei says it would never hand data to China's government.

Along with other parliamentarians from the Liberal Party, including [[Tim Wilson (Australian politician)|Tim Wilson]] and [[James Paterson (Australian politician)|James Paterson]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor's]] [[Kimberley Kitching]] and [[Anthony Byrne (politician)|Anthony Byrne]], he has been active in applying pressure to Australia's partners in the [[Five Eyes]] security alliance to do the same. In a public statement he explained how important that security arrangement is, \"In a time of growing strategic uncertainty, Australia values that membership more than ever.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/four-australian-mps-urge-britain-to-ban-huawei-20200124-p53u9x.html|title=Four Australian MPs urge Britain to ban Huawei|last=Bourke|first=Latika|date=2020-01-23|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> In private settings, it is known that he has supported Byrne, the Deputy Chair of the committee Hastie leads, who used forceful language with the UK leadership, asking \u201cHow would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks?

In an interview about his wartime experiences, he said:<blockquote> For me, it proved that culture and geography (are) decisive in the formation of societies and political institutions. Building lasting, trusted institutions takes time, generations of stewardship and public virtue.<ref name=\"Whinnett\"/></blockquote> Looking at Australia, Hastie believes that it is local institutions that provide civic foundations of \"accountability, freedom and democracy.\"<ref name=\"First Speech\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrewhastie.com.au/first_speech|title=First Speech|website=Andrew Hastie MP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> He argued in his first speech that the first of these institutions is the family, which \"is central to a healthy society\"<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> but also extends to sporting clubs, service clubs, churches and local businesses.<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> In one op-ed, Hastie went even further, suggesting that community groups, or \"pre-political institutions\" are finally more important than governments:<blockquote> \"More powerful than the political levers of government are grassroots volunteer movements and pre-political institutions... Pre-political institutions are the best place for securing our freedoms and so we should take encouragement that democratic governments cannot control them, and are sent packing when they attempt to do so.\"<ref name=\"theaustralian.com.au\">{{Cite news|last=Hastie|first=Andrew|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/opinion/political-class-ignored-the-people-and-paid-the-price/news-story/f1d35ad7c29f76daf08768182b316d55|title=Political class ignored the people and paid the price|date=November 23, 2016|work=The Australian|access-date=February 12, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== The power of community and PTSD ====\nHastie reflected on how his grandfather recovered from the trauma of [[World War II]] thanks, in part to the power of community, and laments that we may not have that power available to us now, \"Just thinking of my grandfather's own experience, he was shot up quite badly in the second world war where civil society was still very strong, community was still very strong, a lot of local clubs and organisations, I think he struggled with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] but I think his PTSD was mitigated by those little platoons that we talk about, he was very close to his comrades from the second war, and I'm just not sure if we have in today's society that same sort of cushioning and community support as we had 70 years ago.\"<ref name=\"Grattan\"/>\n\n==== Community and environment ====\nWhile environmental concern is often seen as a progressive cause, Hastie sets the environment between two concerns - that, as per the [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] contract - the good things inherited should be passed on to the next generation. And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].
