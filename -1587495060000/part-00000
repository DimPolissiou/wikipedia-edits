Due to the occasion, Bergen Cinema arranged Bergen International Film Festival, with the most important films from the festival circuit of the year and many sneak previews of movies already picked up for Norwegian distribution. BIFF was one of the most successful events to take place during the celebration of the Cultural City with almost 20,000 visitors, and was arranged again the year after.\n\nOver the years the festival has grown to be one of the biggest in Norway, with more than 160 films and 64,000 admissions in 2016.\n\n==Programmes==\n\nBergen International Film Festival is organised in various sections:\n\n* '''Checkpoints''', the main program at BIFF, hosted with the [[Rafto Foundation for Human Rights]], consisting of documentaries focusing on human rights.

BIFF also tries to bring filmmakers and even the characters the films portray to the screenings, making it possible for the students to converse with the talent afterwards.

Railroad was incorporated on March 23, 1881, and it planned to build a road from Astoria to Northport via Flushing, Great Neck, Glen Cove, Oyster Bay and Huntington.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> By June 1881, construction plans were authorized and in mid-July the building contract was signed, with work set to begin in August.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> The Long Island Rail Road attempted to undermine the Northern Railroad's project before it could sell stock and acquire a roadbed.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> It was going to link its north side branches together as a continuous railroad to Northport.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> Construction cost from Great Neck to Roslyn and from Locust Valley to Northport was approximately $400,000.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" />\n\nIn February 1883, Austin Corbin, president of the Long Island Rail Road, offered to supply iron and rolling stock for the extension to Oyster Bay if local residents provided the right-of-way.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" />  While citizens considered the offer, the Northern Railroad folded since not enough money was raised.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> With the threat eliminated, the extension of rail service to Oyster Bay was temporarily delayed.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> The project was revived in 1886 when some citizens offered to secure a right-of-way.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> In June 1886, a public meeting was held and a committee of 15 was appointed to secure land.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> Although officials were still contemplating a through line to Northport, the LIRR organized the Oyster Bay Extension Railroad on August 31, 1886, which authorized a five-mile road from Locust Valley to Oyster Bay.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> Ground was broken for the project on August 15, 1887.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> One phase of construction was the building of a bridge over what is now Tunnel Street in Locust Valley.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> The masonry project began in October 1888 and the arch was finished on April 13, 1889.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> The entire bridge was completed by September.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" />\n\nOn June 24, 1889, the extension opened with a huge celebration in Oyster Bay.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> A ceremonial train of ten cars left Long Island City about 9:30&nbsp;a.m. and was met at Locust Valley by ten young ladies who decorated the locomotive with flags and wreaths.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> Upon arrival at Oyster Bay, an organized procession commenced, which was viewed by 5,000 residents and visitors.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> On Tuesday, June 25, the extension opened for regular passenger service with eight round trips daily to and from Long Island City.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /><ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|8}}\n\nThe line ended at Locust Valley for two decades until a final extension added four miles to [[Oyster Bay (LIRR station)|Oyster Bay]].

Railroad was incorporated on March 23, 1881, and it planned to build a road from Astoria to Northport via Flushing, Great Neck, Glen Cove, Oyster Bay and Huntington.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> By June 1881, construction plans were authorized and in mid-July the building contract was signed, with work set to begin in August.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> The Long Island Rail Road attempted to undermine the Northern Railroad's project before it could sell stock and acquire a roadbed.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> It was going to link its north side branches together as a continuous railroad to Northport.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> Construction cost from Great Neck to Roslyn and from Locust Valley to Northport was approximately $400,000.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" />\n\nIn February 1883, Austin Corbin, president of the Long Island Rail Road, offered to supply iron and rolling stock for the extension to Oyster Bay if local residents provided the right-of-way.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" />  While citizens considered the offer, the Northern Railroad folded since not enough money was raised.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> With the threat eliminated, the extension of rail service to Oyster Bay was temporarily delayed.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> The project was revived in 1886 when some citizens offered to secure a right-of-way.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> In June 1886, a public meeting was held and a committee of 15 was appointed to secure land.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> Although officials were still contemplating a through line to Northport, the LIRR organized the Oyster Bay Extension Railroad on August 31, 1886, which authorized a five-mile road from Locust Valley to Oyster Bay.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> Ground was broken for the project on August 15, 1887.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> One phase of construction was the building of a bridge over what is now Tunnel Street in Locust Valley.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> The masonry project began in October 1888 and the arch was finished on April 13, 1889.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> The entire bridge was completed by September.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" />\n\nOn June 24, 1889, the extension opened with a huge celebration in Oyster Bay.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> A ceremonial train of ten cars left Long Island City about 9:30&nbsp;a.m. and was met at Locust Valley by ten young ladies who decorated the locomotive with flags and wreaths.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> Upon arrival at Oyster Bay, an organized procession commenced, which was viewed by 5,000 residents and visitors.<ref name=\"Derek Stadler 2014\" /> On Tuesday, June 25, the extension opened for regular

In an artfully constructed depiction of how Europe is sleepwalking toward disaster, starring Angus Deayton in fiction scenes from a postEU future, the film pairs an imagined view from a dystopian future with insightful, cross national analysis by ordinary Europeans and high level experts on how and why things are going so wrong. Notable interviewees include French economist [[Thomas Piketty]], [[Martin Wolf]], chief economic commentator at the Financial Times, former EU trade commissioner [[Peter Mandelson]], and many former ministers and high level EU officials in various European countries.\n\nIn an authored piece of committed journalism, the filmmakers argue powerfully that, while economic crisis and popular anger are pushing Europe dangerously towards disintegration, the EU is in need of major reform but well worth saving. Subtle, moving, thoughtprovoking and witty, \u201cThe Great European Disaster Movie\u201d is far more than a political film but instead frames Europe through the eyes of those who are most important to its success: the Europeans themselves.\n\n'''Reception'''\n\nThe Great European Disaster Movie is a BBC/ARTE and 7 other European broadcasters coproduction, which has now been watched by 2.360.000 viewers, one million of which in France and Germany. The film premi\u00e8red on BBC Four, as part of the Storyville strand, on 1 March 2015. It was subsequently broadcast in 12 countries (UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Japan) and has been translated in 10 languages, including Japanese.\n\n\u201cThe Great European Disaster Movie\u201d has won the prestigious German CIVIS media prize in the information category. The film has been selected among 930 applications by media programmes from all over Europe. The prize was bestowed by the German Federal President Joachim Gauck and the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz at a star studded event in the German Federal Foreign Office in Berlin in the presence of EU broadcasters yesterday evening May 12.

The Wake Up Europe Campaign has since been organising hundreds of documentary screenings and debates across the world, from the Italian Parliament, Montecitorio to a small Town Hall in Denmark or prestigious Universities such as Oxford or Cambridge, the campaign has engaged thousands of citizens fostering informed debates about the future of our societies. \n\nIn 2014 Piras wrote, directed and produced with Bill Emmott the documentary  \u201cThe Great European Disaster Movie\u201d on the crisis of the [[European Union]] co-produced by Nick Fraser for the BBC Storyville strand, Claudia Bucher, for Arte TV, Axel Arno for SVT, Swedish public Tv.\n\n\"Europe at Sea\", a feature-length documentary co-produced by [[Arte|ARTE]] and [[SVT]] and written, produced and directed by Piras followed for two years the footsteps of [[Federica Mogherini]], the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, as she tried to implement the EU Global Strategy, while facing a relentless series of crisis, andunexpected turns, from the vote on Brexit, to the election of President Trump, to the deepening of the refugees and migrants challenge in the South Mediterranean.

In an artfully constructed depiction of how Europe is sleepwalking toward disaster, starring Angus Deayton in fiction scenes from a postEU future, the film pairs an imagined view from a dystopian future with insightful, cross national analysis by ordinary Europeans and high level experts on how and why things are going so wrong. Notable interviewees include French economist [[Thomas Piketty]], [[Martin Wolf]], chief economic commentator at the Financial Times, former EU trade commissioner [[Peter Mandelson]], and many former ministers and high level EU officials in various European countries.\n\nIn an authored piece of committed journalism, the filmmakers argue powerfully that, while economic crisis and popular anger are pushing Europe dangerously towards disintegration, the EU is in need of major reform but well worth saving. Subtle, moving, thoughtprovoking and witty, \u201cThe Great European Disaster Movie\u201d is far more than a political film but instead frames Europe through the eyes of those who are most important to its success: the Europeans themselves.\n\n'''Reception'''\n\nThe Great European Disaster Movie is a BBC/ARTE and 7 other European broadcasters coproduction, which has now been watched by 2.360.000 viewers, one million of which in France and Germany. The film premi\u00e8red on BBC Four, as part of the Storyville strand, on 1 March 2015. It was subsequently broadcast in 12 countries (UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Japan) and has been translated in 10 languages, including Japanese.\n\n\u201cThe Great European Disaster Movie\u201d has won the prestigious German CIVIS media prize in the information category. The film has been selected among 930 applications by media programmes from all over Europe.

The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i. e., the amount of [[fluid]] (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces.\n[[Three dimensional]] mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes. Volumes of some simple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be easily calculated using [[arithmetic]] [[formula]]s<!--- both \"formulae\" and \"formulas\" are correct plurals of \"formula\" --->. Volumes of complicated shapes can be calculated with [[integral calculus]] if a formula exists for the shape's boundary. One-dimensional figures (such as [[line (mathematics)|lines]]) and [[two-dimensional]] shapes (such as [[square (geometry)|squares]]) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space. Minecraft is a sandbox video game that gets 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999 views per day.\n\nThe volume of a solid (whether regularly or irregularly shaped) can be determined by [[Displacement (fluid)|fluid displacement]]. Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas. The combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of just one of the substances. However, sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and in such cases the combined volume is not [[additive map|additive]].<ref>One litre of sugar (about 970 grams) can dissolve in 0.6 litres of hot water, producing a total volume of less than one litre. {{cite web |url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch18/soluble.php |title=Solubility |accessdate=2010-05-01 |quote=Up to 1800 grams of sucrose can dissolve in a liter of water.}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[differential geometry]]'', volume is expressed by means of the [[volume form]], and is an important global [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]] [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]].\nIn ''[[thermodynamics]]'', volume is a [[gas volume|fundamental parameter]], and is a [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate variable]] to [[pressure]].\n\n==Units==\n{{main|unit of volume}}\n[[File:Volume measurements from The New Student's Reference Work.svg|thumb|220px|Volume measurements from the 1914 [[s:The New Student's Reference Work|The New Student's Reference Work]].\n\n{| style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"navbox\"\n|+ Approximate conversion to metric (mL)'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/appxc.cfm#4e |title=General Tables of Units of Measurement |author= |date= |work= |publisher=NIST Weights and Measures Division |accessdate=2011-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210164956/http://ts.nist.gov/weightsandmeasures/publications/appxc.cfm |archivedate=2011-12-10 |df= }}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |\n! rowspan=2 | {{abbr|Imp.|Imperial}}\n! colspan=2 | U.S.\n|-\n!

For example, a [[cubic centimetre]] (cm<sup>3</sup>) is the volume of a cube whose sides are one [[centimetre]] (1&nbsp;cm) in length.\n\nIn the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre (m<sup>3</sup>).  The [[metric system]] also includes the [[litre]] (L) as a unit of volume, where one litre is the volume of a 10-centimetre cube.  Thus\n:1 litre = (10 cm)<sup>3</sup> = 1000 cubic centimetres = 0.001 cubic metres,\n\nso\n:1 cubic metre = 1000 litres.\nSmall amounts of liquid are often measured in [[millilitre]]s, where\n:1 millilitre = 0.001 litres = 1 cubic centimetre.\nIn the same way, large amounts can be measured in megalitres, where\n:1 million litres = 1000 cubic metres = 1 megalitre.\n\nVarious other traditional units of volume are also in use, including the [[cubic inch]], the [[cubic foot]], the [[cubic yard]], the [[cubic mile]], the [[teaspoon]], the [[tablespoon]], the [[fluid ounce]], the [[fluid dram]], the [[gill (volume)|gill]], the [[pint]], the [[quart]], the [[gallon]], the [[minim (unit)|minim]], the [[barrel (unit)|barrel]], the [[cord (unit)|cord]], the [[peck]], the [[bushel]], the [[hogshead]], the [[acre-foot]] and the [[board foot]].\n{{see also2|[[List of unusual units of measurement#Volume|unusual]]|[[List of obsolete units of measurement#Volume (dry and liquid)|obsolete units of volume]]}}\n\n== Related terms ==\n''Capacity'' is defined by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as \"the measure applied to the content of a vessel, and to liquids, grain, or the like, which take the shape of that which holds them\".<ref>{{OED|capacity}}</ref> (The word ''capacity'' has other unrelated meanings, as in e.g. [[capacity management]].) Capacity is not identical in meaning to volume, though closely related; the capacity of a container is always the volume in its interior. Units of capacity are the [[SI]] litre and its derived units, and Imperial units such as [[Gill (unit)|gill]], [[pint]], [[gallon]], and others. Units of volume are the cubes of [[units of length]]. In SI the units of volume and capacity are closely related: one litre is exactly 1 cubic decimetre, the capacity of a cube with a 10&nbsp;cm side. In other systems the conversion is not trivial; the capacity of a vehicle's fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet, for example, but in gallons (an imperial gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ft).\n\nThe ''[[density]]'' of an object is defined as the ratio of the [[mass]] to the volume.<ref>{{OED|density}}</ref> The inverse of density is ''[[specific volume]]'' which is defined as volume divided by mass. Specific volume is a concept important in [[thermodynamics]] where the [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume of a working fluid]] is often an important parameter of a system being studied.\n\nThe [[volumetric flow rate]] in [[fluid dynamics]] is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time (for example cubic meters per second [m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>]).\n\n== Volume in calculus ==\n{{further|Volume element}}\n\nIn [[calculus]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the volume of a region ''D'' in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> is given by a [[multiple integral|triple integral]] of the constant [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>f(x,y,z)=1</math> over the region and is usually written as:\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D 1 \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz.</math>\n\nIn [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]], the volume integral is\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz, </math>\n\nIn [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] (using the convention for angles with <math>\\theta</math> as the azimuth and <math>\\varphi</math> measured from the polar axis; see more on [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions|conventions]]), the volume integral is\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D \\rho^2 \\sin\\varphi \\,d\\rho \\,d\\theta\\, d\\varphi .</math>\n\n== Volume formulas ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Volumes of some simple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be easily calculated using [[arithmetic]] [[formula]]s<!--- both \"formulae\" and \"formulas\" are correct plurals of \"formula\" --->. Volumes of complicated shapes can be calculated with [[integral calculus]] if a formula exists for the shape's boundary.

For example, a [[cubic centimetre]] (cm<sup>3</sup>) is the volume of a cube whose sides are one [[centimetre]] (1&nbsp;cm) in length.\n\nIn the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre (m<sup>3</sup>).  The [[metric system]] also includes the [[litre]] (L) as a unit of volume, where one litre is the volume of a 10-centimetre cube.  Thus\n:1 litre = (10 cm)<sup>3</sup> = 1000 cubic centimetres = 0.001 cubic metres,\n\nso\n:1 cubic metre = 1000 litres.\nSmall amounts of liquid are often measured in [[millilitre]]s, where\n:1 millilitre = 0.001 litres = 1 cubic centimetre.\nIn the same way, large amounts can be measured in megalitres, where\n:1 million litres = 1000 cubic metres = 1 megalitre.\n\nVarious other traditional units of volume are also in use, including the [[cubic inch]], the [[cubic foot]], the [[cubic yard]], the [[cubic mile]], the [[teaspoon]], the [[tablespoon]], the [[fluid ounce]], the [[fluid dram]], the [[gill (volume)|gill]], the [[pint]], the [[quart]], the [[gallon]], the [[minim (unit)|minim]], the [[barrel (unit)|barrel]], the [[cord (unit)|cord]], the [[peck]], the [[bushel]], the [[hogshead]], the [[acre-foot]] and the [[board foot]].\n{{see also2|[[List of unusual units of measurement#Volume|unusual]]|[[List of obsolete units of measurement#Volume (dry and liquid)|obsolete units of volume]]}}\n\n== Related terms ==\n''Capacity'' is defined by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as \"the measure applied to the content of a vessel, and to liquids, grain, or the like, which take the shape of that which holds them\".<ref>{{OED|capacity}}</ref> (The word ''capacity'' has other unrelated meanings, as in e.g. [[capacity management]].) Capacity is not identical in meaning to volume, though closely related; the capacity of a container is always the volume in its interior. Units of capacity are the [[SI]] litre and its derived units, and Imperial units such as [[Gill (unit)|gill]], [[pint]], [[gallon]], and others. Units of volume are the cubes of [[units of length]]. In SI the units of volume and capacity are closely related: one litre is exactly 1 cubic decimetre, the capacity of a cube with a 10&nbsp;cm side. In other systems the conversion is not trivial; the capacity of a vehicle's fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet, for example, but in gallons (an imperial gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ft).\n\nThe ''[[density]]'' of an object is defined as the ratio of the [[mass]] to the volume.<ref>{{OED|density}}</ref> The inverse of density is ''[[specific volume]]'' which is defined as volume divided by mass. Specific volume is a concept important in [[thermodynamics]] where the [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume of a working fluid]] is often an important parameter of a system being studied.\n\nThe [[volumetric flow rate]] in [[fluid dynamics]] is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time (for example cubic meters per second [m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>]).\n\n== Volume in calculus ==\n{{further|Volume element}}\n\nIn [[calculus]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the volume of a region ''D'' in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> is given by a [[multiple integral|triple integral]] of the constant [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>f(x,y,z)=1</math> over the region and is usually written as:\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D 1 \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz.</math>\n\nIn [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]], the volume integral is\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz, </math>\n\nIn [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] (using the convention for angles with <math>\\theta</math> as the azimuth and <math>\\varphi</math> measured from the polar axis; see more on [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions|conventions]]), the volume integral is\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D \\rho^2 \\sin\\varphi \\,d\\rho \\,d\\theta\\, d\\varphi .</math>\n\n== Volume formulas ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
