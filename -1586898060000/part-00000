The state has a ruler who functions as the highest judiciary and may promulgate and modify laws in some legal domains, but traditional religious scholars (''[[ulama]]'') play a decisive role in interpreting sharia. The classical sharia system is exemplified by Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf states. Iran shares many of the same features, but also possesses characteristics of mixed legal systems, such as a parliament and codified laws.<ref name=\"Otto2008\"/>\n\n===Secular systems===\nSecular systems are those where sharia plays no role in the nation's legal system and religious interference in state affairs, politics, and law is not permitted. Turkey has been an example of a Muslim-majority nation with a secular system, although its secularism has recently come under intense pressure. Several states in West Africa and Central Asia also describe themselves as secular.<ref name=\"Otto2008\"/>\n\n===Mixed systems===\n\nMost Muslim countries have mixed legal systems that postulate a constitution and [[Rule of Law]], while also allowing rules of [[Fiqh|traditional Islamic jurisprudence]] to influence certain areas of national law. These systems possess large bodies of codified laws, which may be based on European or Indian codes. In these systems, the central legislative role is played by politicians and modern jurists rather than traditional religious scholars. Pakistan, Egypt, Malaysia, and Nigeria are examples of states having mixed systems.<ref name=\"Otto2008\"/> Some countries with Muslim minorities, such as Israel, also have mixed systems that administer Islamic law for their Muslim population.<ref name=\"The Sharia Courts\">{{cite web|website=Israel Ministry of Justice|title=The Sharia Courts|url=https://www.justice.gov.il/En/Units/ShariaCourts/Pages/default.aspx|access-date=Mar 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325005530/https://www.justice.gov.il/En/Units/ShariaCourts/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=25 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Domains of application ==\n\n===Constitutional law===\n\nMost Muslim-majority countries incorporate sharia at some level in their legal framework.

In some countries (e.g., Nigeria), people can choose whether to pursue a case in a sharia or secular court.<ref name=otto-18-20/>\n\n===Criminal law===\n\nCountries in the Muslim world generally have criminal codes influenced by French law or common law, and in some cases a combination of Western legal traditions. Saudi Arabia has never adopted a criminal code and Saudi judges still follow traditional Hanbali jurisprudence. In the course of Islamization campaigns, several countries (Libya, Pakistan, Iran, Sudan, Mauritania, and Yemen) inserted Islamic criminal laws into their penal codes, which were otherwise based on Western models. In some countries only ''hudud'' penalties were added, while others also enacted provisions for ''[[qisas]]'' (law of retaliation) and ''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'' (monetary compensation). Iran subsequently issued a new \"Islamic Penal Code\". The criminal codes of Afghanistan and United Arab Emirates contain a general provision that certain crimes are to be punished according to Islamic law, without specifying the penalties. Some Nigerian states have also enacted Islamic criminal laws. [[Islamic criminal law in Aceh|Laws in the Indonesian province of Aceh]] provide for application of discretionary (''[[ta'zir]]'') punishments for violation of Islamic norms, but explicitly exclude ''hudud'' and ''qisas''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Silvia|last=Tellenbach|year=2015|title=Islamic Criminal Law|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Criminal Law|editor1=Markus D.

Iran shares many of the same features, but also possesses characteristics of mixed legal systems, such as a parliament and codified laws.<ref name=\"Otto2008\"/>\n\n===Secular systems===\nSecular systems are those where sharia plays no role in the nation's legal system and religious interference in state affairs, politics, and law is not permitted. Turkey has been an example of a Muslim-majority nation with a secular system, although its secularism has recently come under intense pressure. Several states in West Africa and Central Asia also describe themselves as secular.<ref name=\"Otto2008\"/>\n\n===Mixed systems===\n\nMost Muslim countries have mixed legal systems that postulate a constitution and [[Rule of Law]], while also allowing rules of [[Fiqh|traditional Islamic jurisprudence]] to influence certain areas of national law. These systems possess large bodies of codified laws, which may be based on European or Indian codes. In these systems, the central legislative role is played by politicians and modern jurists rather than traditional religious scholars. Pakistan, Egypt, Malaysia, and Nigeria are examples of states having mixed systems.<ref name=\"Otto2008\"/> Some countries with Muslim minorities, such as Israel, also have mixed systems that administer Islamic law for their Muslim population.<ref name=\"The Sharia Courts\">{{cite web|website=Israel Ministry of Justice|title=The Sharia Courts|url=https://www.justice.gov.il/En/Units/ShariaCourts/Pages/default.aspx|access-date=Mar 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325005530/https://www.justice.gov.il/En/Units/ShariaCourts/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=25 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Domains of application ==\n\n===Constitutional law===\n\nMost Muslim-majority countries incorporate sharia at some level in their legal framework. Their constitutions commonly refer to sharia as a source or the main source of law, though these references are not in themselves indicative of how much the legal system is influenced by sharia, and whether the influence has a traditionalist or modernist character.<ref name=vikor/><ref name=calder/> The same constitutions usually also refer to universal principles such as democracy and human rights, leaving it up to legislators and the judiciary to work out how these norms are to be reconciled in practice.<ref name=otto-18-20>{{cite book |ref=harv |first1=Jan Michiel |last1=Otto |year=2008 |title=Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries: Tensions and Opportunities for Dutch and EU Foreign Policy |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |isbn=978-9087280482 |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/20694/Sharia%20and%20national%20Law%20in%20Muslim%20countries.pdf |pages=18\u201320 |access-date=22 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009235043/https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/20694/Sharia%20and%20national%20Law%20in%20Muslim%20countries.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Conversely, some countries (e.g., Algeria), whose constitution does not mention sharia, possess sharia-based family laws.<ref name=calder/> Nisrine Abiad identifies Bahrain, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia as states with \"strong constitutional consequences\" of sharia \"on the organization and functioning of power\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Nisrine|last=Abiad|title=Sharia, Muslim States and International Human Rights Treaty Obligations: A Comparative Study|publisher=British Institute of International and Comparative Law|year=2008|pages=38\u201342}}</ref>\n\n===Family law===\n\nExcept for secular systems, Muslim-majority countries possess sharia-based family laws (marriage, inheritance, etc). These laws generally reflect influence of various modern-era reforms and tend to be characterized by ambiguity, with traditional and modernist interpretations often manifesting themselves in the same country, both in legislation and court decisions. In some countries (e.g., Nigeria), people can choose whether to pursue a case in a sharia or secular court.<ref name=otto-18-20/>\n\n===Criminal law===\n\nCountries in the Muslim world generally have criminal codes influenced by French law or common law, and in some cases a combination of Western legal traditions. Saudi Arabia has never adopted a criminal code and Saudi judges still follow traditional Hanbali jurisprudence. In the course of Islamization campaigns, several countries (Libya, Pakistan, Iran, Sudan, Mauritania, and Yemen) inserted Islamic criminal laws into their penal codes, which were otherwise based on Western models. In some countries only ''hudud'' penalties were added, while others also enacted provisions for ''[[qisas]]'' (law of retaliation) and ''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'' (monetary compensation). Iran subsequently issued a new \"Islamic Penal Code\". The criminal codes of Afghanistan and United Arab Emirates contain a general provision that certain crimes are to be punished according to Islamic law, without specifying the penalties. Some Nigerian states have also enacted Islamic criminal laws. [[Islamic criminal law in Aceh|Laws in the Indonesian province of Aceh]] provide for application of discretionary (''[[ta'zir]]'') punishments for violation of Islamic norms, but explicitly exclude ''hudud'' and ''qisas''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Silvia|last=Tellenbach|year=2015|title=Islamic Criminal Law|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Criminal Law|editor1=Markus D.

During his time with Lethbridge, he played with future Blackhawks teammate [[Brent Seabrook]] for three seasons. Versteeg made his professional debut, playing in the final 13 games of the [[2005\u201306 AHL season|2005\u201306]] season with Boston's [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Providence Bruins]].\n\n===Chicago Blackhawks===\nVersteeg remained with Providence for the beginning of [[2006\u201307 AHL season|2006\u201307]] before being traded by Boston on February 3, 2007, along with a conditional draft pick, to the Chicago Blackhawks for [[Brandon Bochenski]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/sport/nhl/article_1255309.php/Blackhawks_ship_Bochenski_to_the_Bruins|title=Blackhawks ship Bochenski to the Bruins|publisher=m&c.com|date=2007-02-03|accessdate=2008-11-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404084111/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/sport/nhl/article_1255309.php/Blackhawks_ship_Bochenski_to_the_Bruins|archivedate=2012-04-04}}</ref> As a result, he moved within the AHL to Chicago's minor league affiliate, the [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]].

He made his NHL debut that season as he was called up for a total of 13 games, recording two goals and two assists.\n\n[[File:Kris Versteeg.jpg|thumb|left|Versteeg during the 2009\u201310 season, in his first tenure with the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Blackhawks]].|200px]]\nVersteeg played his first full season with the Blackhawks in [[2008\u201309 NHL season|2008\u201309]].

However, a clerical error in which the Blackhawks failed to tender qualifying offers to their pending RFAs by the league deadline led to speculation Versteeg and several of his teammates would become [[unrestricted free agents]]. As a result, the [[NHL Players' Association]] (NHLPA) filed a grievance on the players' behalf.

Versteeg is a two-time [[Stanley Cup]] champion with the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals|2010]] and [[2015 Stanley Cup Finals|2015]].\n\nOriginally selected 134th overall in the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Boston Bruins]], he played with the club's minor league affiliate, the [[Providence Bruins]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), for parts of two seasons before being traded to the Blackhawks. Versteeg continued playing in the AHL with the Blackhawks' affiliates until making his NHL debut during the [[2007\u201308 NHL season|2007\u201308 season]]. The following campaign, he received a nomination for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as the NHL's best rookie. In his second full season with the Blackhawks, he helped the club win the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs|2010]]. Following Chicago's Cup win, Versteeg played for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and [[Florida Panthers]] before being traded back to Chicago during the [[2013\u201314 NHL season|2013\u201314 season]], winning the [[Stanley Cup]] again in [[2015 Stanley Cup Finals|2015]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Early career and Boston Bruins===\nVersteeg was drafted 134th overall in the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Boston Bruins]], after a four-year [[Western Hockey League]] (WHL) career spanning from [[2002\u201303 WHL season|2002\u201303]] to [[2005\u201306 WHL season|2005\u201306]] and spent with the [[Lethbridge Hurricanes]], [[Kamloops Blazers]] and [[Red Deer Rebels]]. During his time with Lethbridge, he played with future Blackhawks teammate [[Brent Seabrook]] for three seasons. Versteeg made his professional debut, playing in the final 13 games of the [[2005\u201306 AHL season|2005\u201306]] season with Boston's [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Providence Bruins]].\n\n===Chicago Blackhawks===\nVersteeg remained with Providence for the beginning of [[2006\u201307 AHL season|2006\u201307]] before being traded by Boston on February 3, 2007, along with a conditional draft pick, to the Chicago Blackhawks for [[Brandon Bochenski]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/sport/nhl/article_1255309.php/Blackhawks_ship_Bochenski_to_the_Bruins|title=Blackhawks ship Bochenski to the Bruins|publisher=m&c.com|date=2007-02-03|accessdate=2008-11-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404084111/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/sport/nhl/article_1255309.php/Blackhawks_ship_Bochenski_to_the_Bruins|archivedate=2012-04-04}}</ref> As a result, he moved within the AHL to Chicago's minor league affiliate, the [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]]. Versteeg then played for the [[Rockford IceHogs]] in [[2007\u201308 AHL season|2007\u201308]], as Chicago switched its AHL affiliation. He made his NHL debut that season as he was called up for a total of 13 games, recording two goals and two assists.\n\n[[File:Kris Versteeg.jpg|thumb|left|Versteeg during the 2009\u201310 season, in his first tenure with the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Blackhawks]].|200px]]\nVersteeg played his first full season with the Blackhawks in [[2008\u201309 NHL season|2008\u201309]]. On January 1, 2009, he scored the opening goal of the [[2009 Winter Classic]] held at [[Wrigley Field]] against the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Finishing the season with 22 goals and 53 points, second in rookie scoring to [[Bobby Ryan]] of the [[Anaheim Ducks]], he was nominated for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as rookie of the year along with Ryan and goaltender [[Steve Mason (ice hockey)|Steve Mason]] of the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] for his efforts.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ryan, Versteeg, Mason selected as Calder Trophy nominees|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=276043|accessdate=2009-04-23|date=2009-04-22|publisher=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]}}</ref> Mason ended up winning the Calder.\n\nVersteeg's entry-level contract expired after the 2008\u201309 season, which would typically have made him a [[restricted free agent]] (RFA).  However, a clerical error in which the Blackhawks failed to tender qualifying offers to their pending RFAs by the league deadline led to speculation Versteeg and several of his teammates would become [[unrestricted free agents]]. As a result, the [[NHL Players' Association]] (NHLPA) filed a grievance on the players' behalf. Shortly thereafter, on July 8, 2009, he re-signed with the Blackhawks to a three-year contract, worth nearly [[USD|US]]$9 million.<ref>{{cite news | first=Len | last=Ziehm |authorlink= | title=Blackhawks, Kris Versteeg have deal | date=2009-07-08 | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | url =http://www.suntimes.com/sports/hockey/blackhawks/1656279,CST-SPT-hawk08.article | pages = | accessdate = 2009-07-08 | language = }}</ref>\n\nVersteeg's offensive production dropped in his second full NHL season, recording 20 goals and 44 points over 79 games.

On June 30, 2010, he was dealt to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] along with the rights to prospect [[Bill Sweatt]] in exchange for forwards [[Viktor St\u00e5lberg]], [[Chris DiDomenico]] and [[Philippe Paradis]].  He recorded his first [[Gordie Howe hat trick]] (a goal, an assist and a fight) with the Maple Leafs in a game against the [[Ottawa Senators]] on October 9, 2010; he scored against [[Pascal Leclaire]], assisted on a goal by [[Phil Kessel]] and fought [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]].\n\n===Philadelphia Flyers===\nAfter recording 35 points over 53 games with the Maple Leafs in [[2010\u201311 NHL season|2010\u201311]], he was traded for the second time in his career on February 14, 2011.

In 2013, after the release of the \"Red October\" Air Yeezy 2s, Kanye West officially left Nike. Although West described this break as \"heartbreaking\", he claimed that Nike would not pay him royalties for his shoe designs, instead offering to pay some of the proceeds to a charity of West's choice. This ultimately led West to reach out to Adidas. Adidas agreed to give him royalties, and West described the CEO of Adidas as \"someone who allowed [him] to build something\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sneakerfreaker.com/articles/kanye-reflects-on-his-time-with-nike-apologises-to-mark-parker/|title=This is Why Kanye Left Nike|last=DotDev|date=2018-05-02|website=Sneaker Freaker|language=en|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref> In February 2015, a year and three months after the confirmation of the Adidas and Kanye West collaboration, the collaboration officially debuted. \"Yeezy Season 1\" was highly anticipated and celebrities such as [[Rihanna]], [[Sean Combs|Diddy]], and [[Kim Kardashian]] were at the showing. \"Yeezy Season 2\" and \"Yeezy Season 3\" also saw notable amounts of success upon their releases.\n\n==Clothing==\n\"Yeezy Season 1\" was released on October 29th, 2015, and was the first apparel collection to release from this collaboration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/07/06/kanye-west-adidas-history/|title=Kanye West & adidas: How the Collab Happened|date=July 23, 2017|website=Highsnobiety|access-date=2016-07-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sneakernews.com/2015/10/23/adidas-yeezy-season-1-release-date/|title=adidas YEEZY Season 1 Release Date |date=October 23, 2015|website=Sneaker News|access-date=2017-07-25}}</ref> This collection was noted for its stripped-down, [[ready-to-wear]] style, which drew on military clothing and flesh-toned colors.<ref name=\"vogue\">{{cite web|last1=Banks|first1=Tim|title=Yeezy Fall 2015 Ready-to-Wear Collection|url=http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2015-ready-to-wear/kanye-west-adidas-originals|website=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}</ref> The prices ranged from $600 for sweatpants to $3,000 for jackets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/07/06/kanye-west-adidas-history/|title=Kanye West & Adidas: How the Collab Happened|date=July 24, 2017|website=Highsnobiety|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref>  Although the footwear sold out quickly, the apparel collection did not.

On June 30, the first new 350 V2 colourway of 2018 dropped called the \"Butter\".<ref>https://hypebae.com/2018/6/adidas-yeezy-Boost-350-v2-butter-official-images-release-date</ref> The Triple White colour restocked on September 21 <ref>https://sneakernews.com/2018/08/20/adidas-yeezy-Boost-350-v2-cream-restock-info/</ref> and was said to have been the biggest Yeezy drop ever. On November 16, the zebra colourway of the 350 restocked.<ref>http://justfreshkicks.com/yeezy-350-v2-zebra-2018-restock-links/</ref> Shortly after, a new colourway called the \u201cSesame\u201d released on Black Friday of 2018 (November 23). It featured a grey upper, with a white Boost and midsole, completed with a gum-coloured outsole.<ref>https://sneakernews.com/2018/11/22/adidas-yeezy-350-sesame-release-details/</ref> On (Friday) December 14th, 2018 the Frozen Yellows re-released in stores.

All 350 V2 releases in 2018, including the special \"(Reflective) White Static\", maintained the $299 USD/ $399 CAD price tag.<ref>https://sneakerbardetroit.com/adidas-yeezy-Boost-350-v2-static-ef2905-release-date/</ref>\n\n2019 saw the release of more colorways for the 350 V2, including the \"Butter\", \"True Form\", \"Hyperspace\", \"Clay\", \"Glow in the Dark\", \"Black\", \"Black Reflective\", \"Antlia\", \"Antlia Reflective\", \"Synth\", \"Synth Reflective\", \"Lundmark\", \"Lundmark Reflective\", \"Cloud White\", \"Cloud White Reflective\", \"Citrin\", \"Citrin Reflective\", \u201cYeezreel\u201d, \u201cYeezreel Reflective\u201d, \u201cYecheil\u201d, and \u201cYecheil Reflective\u201d. Following in the footsteps of the late 2018 release of the \"Statics\", many of the 2019 releases for the 350 V2 had a normal and \"reflective\" version of the sneaker drop, allowing there to be a more limited and hyped-up release for the reflective shoe while still allowing more people to acquire the more readily available regular version of the colourways.\n\nIn 2020, many new models of the 350 V2 were announced, including the \u201cDesert Sage\u201d, \u201cDesert Sage Reflective\u201d, \u201cMarsh\u201d, \u201cMarsh Reflective\u201d, \u201cYeshaya\u201d, \u201cYeshaya Reflective\u201d, \u201cTailgate\u201d, \u201cTailgate Reflective\u201d, \u201cCinder\u201d, \u201cCinder Reflective\u201d, \u201cSulfur\u201d, \u201cFlax\u201d, \u201cLinen\u201d, and \u201cEarth\u201d, with the \u201cTailgate\u201c, \u201cTailgate Reflective\u201c, \u201cMarsh\u201d, \u201cMarsh Reflective\u201d, \u201cYeshaya\u201d, and the \u201cYeshaya Reflective\u201d already having been released. A notable change to the 350 V2 colorways being released in 2020 is that rather than having a 3M reflective coating throughout the entire shoe, the 3M reflective is put in the stripe on the side of the shoe rather then the entire shoe.\n\n===Yeezy Powerphase===\nThe Adidas Powerphase was released on March 28, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://solecollector.com/news/yeezy-price-guide/adidas-yeezy-powerphase-calabasas|title=The Complete Yeezy Price Guide - Adidas Yeezy Powerphase \"Calabasas\"|work=Sole Collector|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en}}</ref> \"The retro sneakers are an update of an Adidas trainer from the '80s.

A notable change to the 350 V2 colorways being released in 2020 is that rather than having a 3M reflective coating throughout the entire shoe, the 3M reflective is put in the stripe on the side of the shoe rather then the entire shoe.\n\n===Yeezy Powerphase===\nThe Adidas Powerphase was released on March 28, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://solecollector.com/news/yeezy-price-guide/adidas-yeezy-powerphase-calabasas|title=The Complete Yeezy Price Guide - Adidas Yeezy Powerphase \"Calabasas\"|work=Sole Collector|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en}}</ref> \"The retro sneakers are an update of an Adidas trainer from the '80s.

Fermat's theorem is a [[theorem]] in [[real analysis]], named after [[Pierre de Fermat]].\n\nBy using Fermat's theorem, the potential extrema of a function <math>\\displaystyle f</math>, with derivative <math>\\displaystyle f'</math>, are found by solving an [[equation]] in <math>\\displaystyle f'</math>. Fermat's theorem gives only a [[necessary condition]] for extreme function values, as some stationary points are [[inflection point]]s (not a maximum or minimum). The function's [[second derivative]], if it exists, can sometimes be used to determine whether a stationary point is a maximum or minimum.\n\n==Statement==\nOne way to state Fermat's theorem is that, if a [[function (mathematics)|function]] has a local [[Maxima and minima|extremum]] at some point and is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] there, then the function's derivative at that point must be zero. In precise mathematical language:\n\n:Let <math>f\\colon (a,b) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}</math> be a function and suppose that <math>x_0 \\in (a,b)</math> is a point where <math>f</math> has a local extremum. If <math>f</math> is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math>, then <math>f'(x_0) = 0</math>.\n\nAnother way to understand the theorem is via the [[contrapositive]] statement: if the derivative of a function at any point is not zero, then there is not a local extremum at that point. Formally:\n:If <math>f</math> is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at <math>x_0 \\in (a,b)</math>, and <math>f'(x_0) \\neq 0</math>, then <math>x_0</math> is not a local extremum of <math>f</math>.''\n\n===Corollary===\nThe [[Global minimum|global extrema]] of a function ''f'' on a domain ''A'' occur only at [[Bounded function|boundaries]], non-differentiable points, and stationary points.\nIf <math>x_0</math> is a global extremum of ''f'', then one of the following is true:\n* '''boundary:''' <math>x_0</math> is in the boundary of ''A''\n* '''non-differentiable:''' ''f'' is not differentiable at <math>x_0</math>\n* '''stationary point:''' <math>x_0</math> is a stationary point of ''f''\n\n===Extension===\n\nIn higher dimensions, exactly the same statement holds; however, the proof is slightly more complicated. The complication is that in 1 dimension, one can either move left or right from a point, while in higher dimensions, one can move in many directions. Thus, if the derivative does not vanish, one must argue that there is ''some'' direction in which the function increases \u2013 and thus in the opposite direction the function decreases. This is the only change to the proof or the analysis.\n\nThe statement can also be extended to [[differentiable manifolds]]. If <math>f : M \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> is a [[Differentiable manifold#Differentiable functions|differentiable function]] on a manifold <math>M</math>, then its local extrema must be [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of <math>f</math>, in particular points where the [[exterior derivative]] <math>df</math> is [[Zero of a function|zero]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Fermat's theorem about local extrema true for smooth manifolds? |date=August 11, 2015 |url=https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1392981 |work=[[Stack Exchange]] |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{See also|Maxima and minima}}\nFermat's theorem is central to the calculus method of determining maxima and minima: in one dimension, one can find extrema by simply computing the stationary points (by computing the zeros of the derivative), the non-differentiable points, and the boundary points, and then investigating this set to determine the extrema.\n\nOne can do this either by evaluating the function at each point and taking the maximum, or by analyzing the derivatives further, using the [[first derivative test]], the [[second derivative test]], or the [[higher-order derivative test]].\n\n==Intuitive argument==\nIntuitively, a differentiable function is approximated by its derivative \u2013 a differentiable function behaves infinitesimally like a [[linear function]] <math>a+bx,</math> or more precisely, <math>f(x_0) + f'(x_0)\\cdot (x-x_0).</math> Thus, from the perspective that \"if ''f'' is differentiable and has non-vanishing derivative at <math>x_0,</math> then it does not attain an extremum at <math>x_0,</math>\" the intuition is that if the derivative at <math>x_0</math> is positive, the function is ''increasing'' near <math>x_0,</math> while if the derivative is negative, the function is ''decreasing'' near <math>x_0.</math> In both cases, it cannot attain a maximum or minimum, because its value is changing. It can only attain a maximum or minimum if it \"stops\" \u2013 if the derivative vanishes (or if it is not differentiable, or if one runs into the boundary and cannot continue). However, making \"behaves like a linear function\" precise requires careful analytic proof.\n\nMore precisely, the intuition can be stated as: if the derivative is positive, there is ''some point'' to the right of <math>x_0</math> where ''f'' is greater, and ''some point'' to the left of <math>x_0</math> where ''f'' is less, and thus ''f'' attains neither a maximum nor a minimum at <math>x_0.</math> Conversely, if the derivative is negative, there is a point to the right which is lesser, and a point to the left which is greater. Stated this way, the proof is just translating this into equations and verifying \"how much greater or less\".\n\nThe [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is based on the behavior of [[polynomial]] functions. Assume that function ''f'' has a maximum at ''x''<sub>0</sub>, the reasoning being similar for a function minimum. If <math>\\displaystyle x_0 \\in (a,b)</math> is a local maximum then, roughly, there is a (possibly small) [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math> such as the function \"is [[increasing function|increasing]] before\" and \"decreasing after\"<ref group=\"note\">This intuition is only correct for [[continuously differentiable]] <math>\\left(C^1\\right)</math> functions, while in general it is not literally correct&mdash;a function need not be increasing up to a local maximum: it may instead be oscillating, so neither increasing nor decreasing, but simply the local maximum is greater than any values in a small neighborhood to the left or right of it. See details in the pathologies.</ref> <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math>. As the derivative is positive for an increasing function and negative for a decreasing function, <math>\\displaystyle f'</math> is positive before and negative after <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math>. <math>\\displaystyle f'</math> doesn't skip values (by [[Darboux's theorem (analysis)|Darboux's theorem]]), so it has to be zero at some point between the positive and negative values. The only point in the neighbourhood where it is possible to have <math>\\displaystyle f'(x) = 0</math> is <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math>.\n\nThe theorem (and its proof below) is more general than the intuition in that it doesn't require the function to be differentiable over a neighbourhood around <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math>. It is sufficient for the function to be differentiable only in the extreme point.\n\n==Proof==\n\n=== Proof 1: Non-vanishing derivatives implies not extremum ===\nSuppose that ''f'' is differentiable at <math>x_0 \\in (a,b),</math> with derivative ''K,'' and assume [[without loss of generality]] that <math>K > 0,</math> so the tangent line at <math>x_0</math> has positive slope (is increasing). Then there is a neighborhood of <math>x_0</math> on which the secant lines through <math>x_0</math> all have positive slope, and thus to the right of <math>x_0,</math> ''f'' is greater, and to the left of <math>x_0,</math> ''f'' is lesser.\n\nThe schematic of the proof is:\n* an infinitesimal statement about derivative (tangent line) ''at'' <math>x_0</math> implies\n* a local statement about difference quotients (secant lines) ''near'' <math>x_0,</math> which implies\n* a local statement about the ''value'' of ''f'' near <math>x_0.</math>\n\nFormally, by the definition of derivative, <math>f'(x_0) = K</math> means that\n:<math>\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0+\\varepsilon)-f(x_0)}{\\varepsilon} = K.</math>\nIn particular, for sufficiently small <math>\\varepsilon</math> (less than some <math>\\varepsilon_0</math>), the fraction must be at least <math>K/2,</math> by the definition of limit. Thus on the interval <math>(x_0-\\varepsilon_0,x_0+\\varepsilon_0)</math> one has:\n:<math>\\frac{f(x_0+\\varepsilon)-f(x_0)}{\\varepsilon} > K/2;</math>\none has replaced the ''equality'' in the limit (an infinitesimal statement) with an ''inequality'' on a neighborhood (a local statement). Thus, rearranging the equation, if <math>\\varepsilon > 0,</math> then:\n:<math>f(x_0+\\varepsilon) > f(x_0) + (K/2)\\varepsilon > f(x_0),</math>\nso on the interval to the right, ''f'' is greater than <math>f(x_0),</math> and if <math>\\varepsilon < 0,</math> then:\n:<math>f(x_0+\\varepsilon) < f(x_0) + (K/2)\\varepsilon < f(x_0),</math>\nso on the interval to the left, ''f'' is less than <math>f(x_0).</math>\n\nThus <math>x_0</math> is not a local or global maximum or minimum of ''f.''\n\n=== Proof 2: Extremum implies derivative vanishes ===\nAlternatively, one can start by assuming that <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math> is a local maximum, and then prove that the derivative is 0.\n\nSuppose that <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math> is a local maximum (a similar proof applies if <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math> is a local minimum). Then there <math>\\exists \\, \\delta > 0 </math> such that <math>(x_0 - \\delta,x_0 + \\delta) \\subset (a,b)</math> and such that we have <math>f(x_0) \\ge f(x)\\, \\forall  x</math> with <math>\\displaystyle |x - x_0| < \\delta </math>. Hence for any <math>h \\in (0,\\delta)</math> we notice that it holds\n\n:<math>\\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0)}{h} \\le 0.</math>\n\nSince the [[Limit of a function|limit]] of this ratio as <math>\\displaystyle h</math> gets close to 0 from above exists and is equal to <math>\\displaystyle f'(x_0)</math> we conclude that <math>f'(x_0) \\le 0</math>. On the other hand, for <math>h \\in (-\\delta,0)</math> we notice that\n\n:<math>\\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0)}{h} \\ge 0</math>\n\nbut again the limit as <math>\\displaystyle h</math> gets close to 0 from below exists and is equal to <math>\\displaystyle f'(x_0)</math> so we also have <math>f'(x_0) \\ge 0</math>.\n\nHence we conclude that <math>\\displaystyle f'(x_0) = 0.</math>\n\n== Cautions ==\nA subtle misconception that is often held in the context of Fermat's theorem is to assume that it makes a stronger statement about local behavior than it does. Notably, Fermat's theorem does ''not'' say that functions (monotonically) \"increase up to\" or \"decrease down from\" a local maximum. This is very similar to the misconception that a limit means \"monotonically getting closer to a point\". For \"well-behaved functions\" (which here mean continuously differentiable), some intuitions hold, but in general functions may be ill-behaved, as illustrated below. The moral is that derivatives determine ''infinitesimal'' behavior, and that ''continuous'' derivatives determine ''local'' behavior.\n\n=== Continuously differentiable functions ===\nIf ''f'' is [[continuously differentiable]] <math>\\left(C^1\\right)</math> on an [[open set|open]] [[Neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of the point <math>x_0</math>, then <math>f'(x_0) > 0</math> does mean that ''f'' is increasing on a neighborhood of <math>x_0,</math> as follows.\n\nIf <math>f'(x_0) = K > 0</math> and <math>f \\in C^1,</math> then by continuity of the derivative, there is some <math>\\varepsilon_0 > 0</math> such that <math>f'(x) > K/2</math>  <math>\\forall x \\in (x_0 - \\varepsilon_0, x_0 + \\varepsilon_0)</math>. Then ''f'' is increasing on this interval, by the [[mean value theorem]]: the slope of any secant line is at least <math>K/2,</math> as it equals the slope of some tangent line.\n\nHowever, in the general statement of Fermat's theorem, where one is only given that the derivative ''at'' <math>x_0</math> is positive, one can only conclude that secant lines ''through'' <math>x_0</math> will have positive slope, for secant lines between <math>x_0</math> and near enough points.\n\nConversely, if the derivative of ''f'' at a point is zero (<math>x_0</math> is a stationary point), one cannot in general conclude anything about the local behavior of ''f'' \u2013 it may increase to one side and decrease to the other (as in <math>x^3</math>), increase to both sides (as in <math>x^4</math>), decrease to both sides (as in <math>-x^4</math>), or behave in more complicated ways, such as oscillating (as in <math>x^2 \\sin(1/x)</math>, as discussed below).\n\nOne can analyze the infinitesimal behavior via the [[second derivative test]] and [[higher-order derivative test]], if the function is differentiable enough, and if the first non-vanishing derivative at <math>x_0</math> is a continuous function, one can then conclude local behavior (i.e., if <math>f^{(k)}(x_0) \\neq 0</math> is the first non-vanishing derivative, and <math>f^{(k)}</math> is continuous, so <math>f \\in C^k</math>), then one can treat ''f'' as locally close to a polynomial of degree ''k,'' since it behaves approximately as <math>f^{(k)}(x_0) (x - x_0)^k,</math> but if the ''k''-th derivative is not continuous, one cannot draw such conclusions, and it may behave rather differently.\n\n=== Pathological functions ===\nConsider the function <math>\\sin(1/x)</math> \u2013 it oscillates increasingly rapidly between <math>-1</math> and <math>1</math> as ''x'' approaches 0. Consider then <math>f(x)=(1+\\sin(1/x))x^2</math> \u2013 this oscillates increasingly rapidly between 0 and <math>2x^2</math> as ''x'' approaches 0. If one extends this function by <math>f(0) := 0,</math> then the function is continuous and everywhere differentiable (it is differentiable at 0 with derivative 0), but has rather unexpected behavior near 0: in any neighborhood of 0 it attains 0 infinitely many times, but also equals <math>2x^2</math> (a positive number) infinitely often.\n\nContinuing in this vein, <math>f(x)=(2+\\sin(1/x))x^2</math> oscillates between <math>x^2</math> and <math>3x^2,</math> and <math>x=0</math> is a local and global minimum, but on no neighborhood of 0 is it decreasing down to or increasing up from 0 \u2013 it oscillates wildly near 0.\n\nThis pathology can be understood because, while the function is everywhere differentiable, it is not ''continuously'' differentiable: the limit of <math>f'(x)</math> as <math>x \\to 0</math> does not exist, so the derivative is not continuous at 0. This reflects the oscillation between increasing and decreasing values as it approaches 0.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Optimization (mathematics)]]\n* [[Maxima and minima]]\n* [[Derivative]]\n* [[Extreme value]]\n* [[arg max]] <!-- lower case intentional -->\n* [[Adequality]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{PlanetMath reference|id=4450|title=Fermat's Theorem (stationary points)}}\n* {{PlanetMath reference|id=4452|title=Proof of Fermat's Theorem (stationary points)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fermat's Theorem (Stationary Points)}}\n[[Category:Theorems in real analysis]]\n[[Category:Differential calculus]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:Theorems in calculus]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|Fermat's theorem concerning the maximums and minimums of functions|other theorems also named after Pierre de Fermat|Fermat's theorem}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2019}}\nIn mathematics, '''Fermat's theorem''' (also known as '''interior extremum theorem''') is a method to find local [[maximum|maxima]] and [[minimum|minima]] of [[differentiable function]]s on [[open sets]] by showing that every local [[Maxima and minima|extremum]] of the function is a [[stationary point]] (the function [[derivative]] is zero at that point).

If <math>f : M \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> is a [[Differentiable manifold#Differentiable functions|differentiable function]] on a manifold <math>M</math>, then its local extrema must be [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of <math>f</math>, in particular points where the [[exterior derivative]] <math>df</math> is [[Zero of a function|zero]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Fermat's theorem about local extrema true for smooth manifolds? |date=August 11, 2015 |url=https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1392981 |work=[[Stack Exchange]] |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{See also|Maxima and minima}}\nFermat's theorem is central to the calculus method of determining maxima and minima: in one dimension, one can find extrema by simply computing the stationary points (by computing the zeros of the derivative), the non-differentiable points, and the boundary points, and then investigating this set to determine the extrema.\n\nOne can do this either by evaluating the function at each point and taking the maximum, or by analyzing the derivatives further, using the [[first derivative test]], the [[second derivative test]], or the [[higher-order derivative test]].\n\n==Intuitive argument==\nIntuitively, a differentiable function is approximated by its derivative \u2013 a differentiable function behaves infinitesimally like a [[linear function]] <math>a+bx,</math> or more precisely, <math>f(x_0) + f'(x_0)\\cdot (x-x_0).</math> Thus, from the perspective that \"if ''f'' is differentiable and has non-vanishing derivative at <math>x_0,</math> then it does not attain an extremum at <math>x_0,</math>\" the intuition is that if the derivative at <math>x_0</math> is positive, the function is ''increasing'' near <math>x_0,</math> while if the derivative is negative, the function is ''decreasing'' near <math>x_0.</math> In both cases, it cannot attain a maximum or minimum, because its value is changing. It can only attain a maximum or minimum if it \"stops\" \u2013 if the derivative vanishes (or if it is not differentiable, or if one runs into the boundary and cannot continue). However, making \"behaves like a linear function\" precise requires careful analytic proof.\n\nMore precisely, the intuition can be stated as: if the derivative is positive, there is ''some point'' to the right of <math>x_0</math> where ''f'' is greater, and ''some point'' to the left of <math>x_0</math> where ''f'' is less, and thus ''f'' attains neither a maximum nor a minimum at <math>x_0.</math> Conversely, if the derivative is negative, there is a point to the right which is lesser, and a point to the left which is greater. Stated this way, the proof is just translating this into equations and verifying \"how much greater or less\".\n\nThe [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is based on the behavior of [[polynomial]] functions. Assume that function ''f'' has a maximum at ''x''<sub>0</sub>, the reasoning being similar for a function minimum. If <math>\\displaystyle x_0 \\in (a,b)</math> is a local maximum then, roughly, there is a (possibly small) [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math> such as the function \"is [[increasing function|increasing]] before\" and \"decreasing after\"<ref group=\"note\">This intuition is only correct for [[continuously differentiable]] <math>\\left(C^1\\right)</math> functions, while in general it is not literally correct&mdash;a function need not be increasing up to a local maximum: it may instead be oscillating, so neither increasing nor decreasing, but simply the local maximum is greater than any values in a small neighborhood to the left or right of it. See details in the pathologies.</ref> <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math>. As the derivative is positive for an increasing function and negative for a decreasing function, <math>\\displaystyle f'</math> is positive before and negative after <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math>. <math>\\displaystyle f'</math> doesn't skip values (by [[Darboux's theorem (analysis)|Darboux's theorem]]), so it has to be zero at some point between the positive and negative values. The only point in the neighbourhood where it is possible to have <math>\\displaystyle f'(x) = 0</math> is <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math>.\n\nThe theorem (and its proof below) is more general than the intuition in that it doesn't require the function to be differentiable over a neighbourhood around <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math>. It is sufficient for the function to be differentiable only in the extreme point.\n\n==Proof==\n\n=== Proof 1: Non-vanishing derivatives implies not extremum ===\nSuppose that ''f'' is differentiable at <math>x_0 \\in (a,b),</math> with derivative ''K,'' and assume [[without loss of generality]] that <math>K > 0,</math> so the tangent line at <math>x_0</math> has positive slope (is increasing). Then there is a neighborhood of <math>x_0</math> on which the secant lines through <math>x_0</math> all have positive slope, and thus to the right of <math>x_0,</math> ''f'' is greater, and to the left of <math>x_0,</math> ''f'' is lesser.\n\nThe schematic of the proof is:\n* an infinitesimal statement about derivative (tangent line) ''at'' <math>x_0</math> implies\n* a local statement about difference quotients (secant lines) ''near'' <math>x_0,</math> which implies\n* a local statement about the ''value'' of ''f'' near <math>x_0.</math>\n\nFormally, by the definition of derivative, <math>f'(x_0) = K</math> means that\n:<math>\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0+\\varepsilon)-f(x_0)}{\\varepsilon} = K.</math>\nIn particular, for sufficiently small <math>\\varepsilon</math> (less than some <math>\\varepsilon_0</math>), the fraction must be at least <math>K/2,</math> by the definition of limit. Thus on the interval <math>(x_0-\\varepsilon_0,x_0+\\varepsilon_0)</math> one has:\n:<math>\\frac{f(x_0+\\varepsilon)-f(x_0)}{\\varepsilon} > K/2;</math>\none has replaced the ''equality'' in the limit (an infinitesimal statement) with an ''inequality'' on a neighborhood (a local statement). Thus, rearranging the equation, if <math>\\varepsilon > 0,</math> then:\n:<math>f(x_0+\\varepsilon) > f(x_0) + (K/2)\\varepsilon > f(x_0),</math>\nso on the interval to the right, ''f'' is greater than <math>f(x_0),</math> and if <math>\\varepsilon < 0,</math> then:\n:<math>f(x_0+\\varepsilon) < f(x_0) + (K/2)\\varepsilon < f(x_0),</math>\nso on the interval to the left, ''f'' is less than <math>f(x_0).</math>\n\nThus <math>x_0</math> is not a local or global maximum or minimum of ''f.''\n\n=== Proof 2: Extremum implies derivative vanishes ===\nAlternatively, one can start by assuming that <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math> is a local maximum, and then prove that the derivative is 0.\n\nSuppose that <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math> is a local maximum (a similar proof applies if <math>\\displaystyle x_0</math> is a local minimum). Then there <math>\\exists \\, \\delta > 0 </math> such that <math>(x_0 - \\delta,x_0 + \\delta) \\subset (a,b)</math> and such that we have <math>f(x_0) \\ge f(x)\\, \\forall  x</math> with <math>\\displaystyle |x - x_0| < \\delta </math>. Hence for any <math>h \\in (0,\\delta)</math> we notice that it holds\n\n:<math>\\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0)}{h} \\le 0.</math>\n\nSince the [[Limit of a function|limit]] of this ratio as <math>\\displaystyle h</math> gets close to 0 from above exists and is equal to <math>\\displaystyle f'(x_0)</math> we conclude that <math>f'(x_0) \\le 0</math>. On the other hand, for <math>h \\in (-\\delta,0)</math> we notice that\n\n:<math>\\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0)}{h} \\ge 0</math>\n\nbut again the limit as <math>\\displaystyle h</math> gets close to 0 from below exists and is equal to <math>\\displaystyle f'(x_0)</math> so we also have <math>f'(x_0) \\ge 0</math>.\n\nHence we conclude that <math>\\displaystyle f'(x_0) = 0.</math>\n\n== Cautions ==\nA subtle misconception that is often held in the context of Fermat's theorem is to assume that it makes a stronger statement about local behavior than it does. Notably, Fermat's theorem does ''not'' say that functions (monotonically) \"increase up to\" or \"decrease down from\" a local maximum. This is very similar to the misconception that a limit means \"monotonically getting closer to a point\". For \"well-behaved functions\" (which here mean continuously differentiable), some intuitions hold, but in general functions may be ill-behaved, as illustrated below. The moral is that derivatives determine ''infinitesimal'' behavior, and that ''continuous'' derivatives determine ''local'' behavior.\n\n=== Continuously differentiable functions ===\nIf ''f'' is [[continuously differentiable]] <math>\\left(C^1\\right)</math> on an [[open set|open]] [[Neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of the point <math>x_0</math>, then <math>f'(x_0) > 0</math> does mean that ''f'' is increasing on a neighborhood of <math>x_0,</math> as follows.\n\nIf <math>f'(x_0) = K > 0</math> and <math>f \\in C^1,</math> then\nby continuity of the derivative, there is some <math>\\varepsilon_0>0</math> such that <math>f'(x) > K/2</math>  <math>\\forall x\\in\\left(x_0-\\varepsilon_0,x_0+\\varepsilon_0\\right)</math>. Then ''f'' is increasing on this interval, by the [[mean value theorem]]: the slope of any secant line is at least <math>K/2,</math> as it equals the slope of some tangent line.\n\nHowever, in the general statement of Fermat's theorem, where one is only given that the derivative ''at'' <math>x_0</math> is positive, one can only conclude that secant lines ''through'' <math>x_0</math> will have positive slope, for secant lines between <math>x_0</math> and near enough points.\n\nConversely, if the derivative of ''f'' at a point is zero (<math>x_0</math> is a stationary point), one cannot in general conclude anything about the local behavior of ''f'' \u2013 it may increase to one side and decrease to the other (as in <math>x^3</math>), increase to both sides (as in <math>x^4</math>), decrease to both sides (as in <math>-x^4</math>), or behave in more complicated ways, such as oscillating (as in <math>x^2(\\sin(1/x))</math>, as discussed below).\n\nOne can analyze the infinitesimal behavior via the [[second derivative test]] and [[higher-order derivative test]], if the function is differentiable enough, and if the first non-vanishing derivative at <math>x_0</math> is a continuous function, one can then conclude local behavior (i.e., if <math>f^{(k)}(x_0) \\neq 0</math> is the first non-vanishing derivative, and <math>f^{(k)}</math> is continuous, so <math>f\\in C^k</math>), then one can treat ''f'' as locally close to a polynomial of degree ''k,'' since it behaves approximately as <math>f^{(k)}(x_0) (x-x_0)^k,</math> but if the ''k''th derivative is not continuous, one cannot draw such conclusions, and it may behave rather differently.\n\n=== Pathological functions ===\nConsider the function <math>\\sin(1/x)</math> \u2013 it oscillates increasingly rapidly between <math>-1</math> and <math>1</math> as ''x'' approaches 0. Consider then <math>f(x)=(1+\\sin(1/x))x^2</math> \u2013 this oscillates increasingly rapidly between 0 and <math>2x^2</math> as ''x'' approaches 0. If one extends this function by <math>f(0) := 0,</math> then the function is continuous and everywhere differentiable (it is differentiable at 0 with derivative 0), but has rather unexpected behavior near 0: in any neighborhood of 0 it attains 0 infinitely many times, but also equals <math>2x^2</math> (a positive number) infinitely often.\n\nContinuing in this vein, <math>f(x)=(2+\\sin(1/x))x^2</math> oscillates between <math>x^2</math> and <math>3x^2,</math> and <math>x=0</math> is a local and global minimum, but on no neighborhood of 0 is it decreasing down to or increasing up from 0 \u2013 it oscillates wildly near 0.\n\nThis pathology can be understood because, while the function is everywhere differentiable, it is not ''continuously'' differentiable: the limit of <math>f'(x)</math> as <math>x \\to 0</math> does not exist, so the derivative is not continuous at 0. This reflects the oscillation between increasing and decreasing values as it approaches 0.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Optimization (mathematics)]]\n* [[Maxima and minima]]\n* [[Derivative]]\n* [[Extreme value]]\n* [[arg max]] <!-- lower case intentional -->\n* [[Adequality]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{PlanetMath reference|id=4450|title=Fermat's Theorem (stationary points)}}\n* {{PlanetMath reference|id=4452|title=Proof of Fermat's Theorem (stationary points)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fermat's Theorem (Stationary Points)}}\n[[Category:Theorems in real analysis]]\n[[Category:Differential calculus]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:Theorems in calculus]]\n", "name_user": "Mikhail Ryazanov", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eContinuously differentiable functions:fmt.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_theorem_(stationary_points)"}

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the [[Force Publique]] fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}\n[[File:Monument Albert Kinshasa 5.JPG|thumb|Colonial officials, including the Governor-General, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]], in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1938.]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the [[Belgian Congo]], which it had controlled since its annexation of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=Larousse1>{{cite web|title=Empire Colonial Belge|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Empire_colonial_belge/182725|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions Larousse]]|work=Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time.<ref name=Killingray7>{{cite book|last=Killingray|first=David|title=Fighting for Britain: African soldiers in the Second World War|year=2010|publisher=James Currey|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1-84701-015-5|page=7}}</ref> The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The [[Great Depression]] led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment. The only industry that expanded during the time period was centered around [[cotton]] production.<ref>{{cite journal| last = G\u00e9rard-Libois| first = Jules| last2 = Verhaegen| first2 = Beno\u00eet| title = Le Congo: Du domaine de L\u00e9opold II \u00e0 l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance| journal =  Courrier hebdomadaire du CRISP| issue = 1077| pages = 1\u201334| publisher = Centre de recherche et d'information socio-politiques| date = 26 April 1985| language = French| url = https://www.cairn.info/revue-courrier-hebdomadaire-du-crisp-1985-12-page-1.htm| doi = 10.3917/cris.1077.0001}}</ref>\n\nThe Belgian government followed a policy of neutrality during the interwar years.

The British government refused, wanting to ensure that the Congo would not fall under German control, and France followed suit. The French government briefly considered sending troops to occupy [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=122}} On the day of the Belgian Army's surrender, the British government, uncertain about what would happen to the territory, held a crisis meeting in London. The [[Admiralty]] proposed sending troops to occupy strategic locations in the Congo, but this was quickly ruled unfeasible due to other military commitments. The British government then resolved that if the Belgian government collapsed, it would support an \"independent\" Congo.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nWithin the Congo itself, opinion was divided on whether or not to continue to support the war. Belgian corporate officials hoped that the colony would take a neutral stance, and the staff of the [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, recommended a declaration of neutrality or even independence under the authority of the [[List of colonial governors of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo|Governor-General of the Congo]], [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Ryckmans refused to take this advice,{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=127}} and declared on the day of the Belgian Army's surrender that the colony would remain loyal to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref name=Urome>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=L'Histoire du Congo vue par les Coloniaux|publisher=Urome.be|url=http://www.urome.be/pdf/fhisconbe.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Despite this assurance, disruption broke out in the city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future of the colony and the threat of an Italian invasion.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOn 17 June France declared an armistice with Germany. Though Ryckmans had declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72, 231}} Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]] believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}} Meanwhile, some circles in occupied Belgium feared that if the Congo aligned itself with the Allies it would be permanently lost as a colony to Belgium. In Brussels, the Germans established a \"Kolonial Politisches B\u00fcro\" that attempted to forge connections with what remained of the Ministry of Colonies.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=81}} On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}}  The government agreed to the idea, and on 18 June it passed a law-decree, granting de Vleeschauwer the title and conferring on him full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo. The decree also stipulated that in the event the administrator-general was unable to exercise his duties, the responsibility would be passed on to the governor-general.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=123, 132}}\n\nDe Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}} He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the [[Belgian government in exile]], recognised by the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Despite his presence, de Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister [[Camille Gutt]] and played little role thereafter in the government.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=237\u2013238}} There was also conflict between de Vleeschauwer, who wanted to assure his own authority over the Congo, and Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] who sought to be more conciliatory with regard to Allied influence in the colony.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=131}}\n\nThe Germans were upset by the Congo's support for the Allies, and threatened to apply sanctions to Belgian colonial enterprises. Leopold III expressed his discontent with Ryckman's decisions, believing that the colony should remain neutral.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=128}} Royalist politicians sent messages to the Belgian authorities in London, attempting to dissuade them from allowing the Congo to support the British war effort. In October 1940 Leopold III requested permission from Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] to dispatch an emissary to L\u00e9opoldville to persuade the colonial administration to assume neutrality, but the trip was never authorised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\n==Economic contribution==\n=== Allied support ===\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"The Belgian Congo has entered the service of the Allies.

Most Congolese diamonds were mined by [[Formini\u00e8re]], a subsidiary of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique]], which was in turn a member of the [[De Beers]] Diamond Syndicate.

Immediately after the outbreak of war reported production sharply declined, and by 1942 production had officially fallen to 5 million carats\u2013roughly the original production number minus the amount exported to Germany before the war. Believing that a large volume of diamonds were being smuggled out of the colony, American intelligence officials convinced British agents to inspect the security of the mines.

In 1943 Germany paid the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale $10.5 million for diamonds. American and British agents ultimately uncovered a wide smuggling network that brought diamonds out of the Congo and to German-occupied Europe by air and sea. Proposals by the Americans to stifle the illicit trade were dissuaded by the British [[Ministry of Economic Warfare]], whose Diamond Committee was dominated by members of the De Beers Diamond Syndicate.

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the [[Force Publique]] fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}\n[[File:Monument Albert Kinshasa 5.JPG|thumb|Colonial officials, including the Governor-General, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]], in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1938.]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the [[Belgian Congo]], which it had controlled since its annexation of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=Larousse1>{{cite web|title=Empire Colonial Belge|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Empire_colonial_belge/182725|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions Larousse]]|work=Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time.<ref name=Killingray7>{{cite book|last=Killingray|first=David|title=Fighting for Britain: African soldiers in the Second World War|year=2010|publisher=James Currey|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1-84701-015-5|page=7}}</ref> The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The [[Great Depression]] led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment.

The British government refused, wanting to ensure that the Congo would not fall under German control, and France followed suit. The French government briefly considered sending troops to occupy [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=122}} On the day of the Belgian Army's surrender, the British government, uncertain about what would happen to the territory, held a crisis meeting in London. The [[Admiralty]] proposed sending troops to occupy strategic locations in the Congo, but this was quickly ruled unfeasible due to other military commitments. The British government then resolved that if the Belgian government collapsed, it would support an \"independent\" Congo.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nWithin the Congo itself, opinion was divided on whether or not to continue to support the war. Belgian corporate officials hoped that the colony would take a neutral stance, and the staff of the [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, recommended a declaration of neutrality or even independence under the authority of the [[List of colonial governors of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo|Governor-General of the Congo]], [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Ryckmans refused to take this advice,{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=127}} and declared on the day of the Belgian Army's surrender that the colony would remain loyal to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref name=Urome>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=L'Histoire du Congo vue par les Coloniaux|publisher=Urome.be|url=http://www.urome.be/pdf/fhisconbe.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Despite this assurance, disruption broke out in the city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future of the colony and the threat of an Italian invasion.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOn 17 June France declared an armistice with Germany. Though Ryckmans had declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72, 231}} Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]] believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}} Meanwhile, some circles in occupied Belgium feared that if the Congo aligned itself with the Allies it would be permanently lost as a colony to Belgium. In Brussels, the Germans established a \"Kolonial Politisches B\u00fcro\" that attempted to forge connections with what remained of the Ministry of Colonies.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=81}} On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}}  The government agreed to the idea, and on 18 June it passed a law-decree, granting de Vleeschauwer the title and conferring on him full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo. The decree also stipulated that in the event the administrator-general was unable to exercise his duties, the responsibility would be passed on to the governor-general.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=123, 132}}\n\nDe Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}} He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the [[Belgian government in exile]], recognised by the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Despite his presence, de Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister [[Camille Gutt]] and played little role thereafter in the government.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=237\u2013238}} There was also conflict between de Vleeschauwer, who wanted to assure his own authority over the Congo, and Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] who sought to be more conciliatory with regard to Allied influence in the colony.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=131}}\n\nThe Germans were upset by the Congo's support for the Allies, and threatened to apply sanctions to Belgian colonial enterprises. Leopold III expressed his discontent with Ryckman's decisions, believing that the colony should remain neutral.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=128}} Royalist politicians sent messages to the Belgian authorities in London, attempting to dissuade them from allowing the Congo support the British war effort. In October 1940 Leopold III requested permission from Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] to dispatch an emissary to L\u00e9opoldville to persuade the colonial administration to assume neutrality, but the trip was never authorised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\n==Economic contribution==\n=== Allied support ===\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"The Belgian Congo has entered the service of the Allies.

Business leaders in the colony were disgruntled as well, and boosted production of goods not mentioned in the agreement to sell to the neutral United States at their standard market value.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=235}} In 1942, after the United States joined the Allies, the Belgian government negotiated a new economic agreement with the United States and United Kingdom.

In 1940, the Syndicate reported that the Congo annually produced 10.9 million carats of diamonds. Immediately after the outbreak of war reported production sharply declined, and by 1942 production had officially fallen to 5 million carats\u2013roughly the original production number minus the amount exported to Germany before the war. Believing that a large volume of diamonds were being smuggled out of the colony, American intelligence officials convinced British agents to inspect the security of the mines. The officer tasked with overseeing the inspection teams concluded that proper security measures were lacking and that Formini\u00e8re and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mini\u00e8re de Beceka]] personnel fostered a \"sinister atmosphere\" during the tours.{{sfn|Farrell-Robert|2007|loc=Chapter 7 - Diamonds for Hitler}} Firmin van Bree, the director of Formini\u00e8re, was widely suspected of maintaining German sympathies.{{sfn|Farrell-Robert|2007|loc=Chapter 7 - Diamonds for Hitler}}{{sfn|Williams|2018|p=50}} The German government conducted secret negotiations with leaders of Formini\u00e8re and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and reached deals that allowed them to purchase large quantities of diamonds until 1944. In 1943 Germany paid the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale $10.5 million for diamonds. American and British agents ultimately uncovered a wide smuggling network that brought diamonds out of the Congo and to German-occupied Europe by air and sea. Proposals by the Americans to stifle the illicit trade were dissuaded by the British [[Ministry of Economic Warfare]], whose Diamond Committee was dominated by members of the De Beers Diamond Syndicate. After the end of the war the Belgian government demanded that Germany pay $25 million owed to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale for 576,676 carats of diamonds.{{sfn|Farrell-Robert|2007|loc=Chapter 7 - Diamonds for Hitler}}\n\n==Military involvement==\n=== Force Publique ===\n[[File:Belgian Congo enlisting for the Force Publique.jpg|thumb|275px|Congolese enlisting in the Force Publique following the outbreak of war]]\nThe [[Force Publique]] (or \"Public Force\") was the combined police and military force of both the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi.
