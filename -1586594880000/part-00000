It identifies 42 topics considered [[social determinants of health]] and approximately 1200 specific goals considered to improve population health. It provides links to the current research available for selected topics and identifies and supports the need for community involvement considered essential to address these problems realistically.<ref>[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Health People 2020]</ref>\n\n==The human role of economic inequality==\n\nRecently, human role has been encouraged by the influence of population growth there has been increasing interest from [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] on the subject of [[economic inequality]] and its relation to the health of populations. There is a very robust correlation between [[Social status|socioeconomic status]] and health. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy,  [[heart disease]], [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], certain types of [[cancer]], and [[premature aging]]. Despite the reality of the [[Socioeconomic status#health|SES Gradient]], there is debate as to its cause. A number of researchers (A. Leigh, C. Jencks, A. Clarkwest\u2014see also Russell Sage working papers) see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the better-off, but they find little correlation due to [[social status]] differences.\n\nOther researchers such as [[Richard G. Wilkinson]], J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care. Most famous for linking social status with health are the [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall studies]]\u2014a series of studies conducted on [[civil servants]] in [[London]]. The studies found that, despite the fact that all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship stayed strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as [[exercise]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]]. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting [[type 1 diabetes]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]\u2014yet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status. Lastly, it has been found that amongst the wealthiest quarter of countries on earth (a set stretching from [[Luxembourg]] to [[Slovakia]]) there is no relation between a country's wealth and general population health{{ref|sci_amer_dec_2005}}\u2014suggesting that past a certain level, absolute levels of wealth have little impact on population health, but relative levels within a country do.\nThe concept of [[psychosocial stress]] attempts to explain how psychosocial phenomenon such as [[Social status|status]] and [[social stratification]] can lead to the many diseases associated with the [[SES gradient]]. Higher levels of economic inequality tend to intensify social hierarchies and generally degrades the quality of social relations\u2014leading to greater levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and stress related diseases. Richard Wilkinson found this to be true not only for the poorest members of society, but also for the wealthiest. Economic inequality is bad for everyone's health.''' \nInequality does not only affect the health of human populations. David H. Abbott at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center found that among many primate species, less egalitarian social structures correlated with higher levels of stress hormones among socially subordinate individuals. Research by [[Robert Sapolsky]] of [[Stanford University]] provides similar findings.\n\n==Research==\nThere is well-documented variation in health outcomes and health care utilization & costs by geographic variation in the U.S., down to the level of Hospital Referral Regions (defined as a regional health care market, which may cross state boundaries, of which there are 306 in the U.S.).<ref>{{cite book |author1=Chandra, A |author2=Skinner, JS | title= Geography and Racial Health Disparities, Chapter 16 of Critical Perspectives on Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life. |year=2004|publisher=National Research Council|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6555551.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/data/region/| title=Data by Region, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care|accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> There is ongoing debate as to the relative contributions of race, gender, poverty, education level and place to these variations.

It identifies 42 topics considered [[social determinants of health]] and approximately 1200 specific goals considered to improve population health. It provides links to the current research available for selected topics and identifies and supports the need for community involvement considered essential to address these problems realistically.<ref>[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Health People 2020]</ref>\n\n==The human role of economic inequality==\n\nRecently, human role has been encouraged by the influence of population growth there has been increasing interest from [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] on the subject of [[economic inequality]] and its relation to the health of populations. There is a very robust correlation between [[Social status|socioeconomic status]] and health. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy,  [[heart disease]], [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], certain types of [[cancer]], and [[premature aging]]. Despite the reality of the [[Socioeconomic status#health|SES Gradient]], there is debate as to its cause. A number of researchers (A. Leigh, C. Jencks, A. Clarkwest\u2014see also Russell Sage working papers) see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the better-off, but they find little correlation due to [[social status]] differences.\n\nOther researchers such as [[Richard G. Wilkinson]], J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care. Most famous for linking social status with health are the [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall studies]]\u2014a series of studies conducted on [[civil servants]] in [[London]]. The studies found that, despite the fact that all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship stayed strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as [[exercise]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]]. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting [[type 1 diabetes]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]\u2014yet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status. Lastly, it has been found that amongst the wealthiest quarter of countries on earth (a set stretching from [[Luxembourg]] to [[Slovakia]]) there is no relation between a country's wealth and general population health{{ref|sci_amer_dec_2005}}\u2014suggesting that past a certain level, absolute levels of wealth have little impact on population health, but relative levels within a country do.\nThe concept of [[psychosocial stress]] attempts to explain how psychosocial phenomenon such as [[Social status|status]] and [[social stratification]] can lead to the many diseases associated with the [[SES gradient]]. Higher levels of economic inequality tend to intensify social hierarchies and generally degrades the quality of social relations\u2014leading to greater levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and stress related diseases. Richard Wilkinson found this to be true not only for the poorest members of society, but also for the wealthiest. Economic inequality is bad for everyone's health.''' \nInequality does not only affect the health of human populations. David H. Abbott at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center found that among many primate species, less egalitarian social structures correlated with higher levels of stress hormones among socially subordinate individuals. Research by [[Robert Sapolsky]] of [[Stanford University]] provides similar findings.\n\n==Research==\nThere is well-documented variation in health outcomes and health care utilization & costs by geographic variation in the U.S., down to the level of Hospital Referral Regions (defined as a regional health care market, which may cross state boundaries, of which there are 306 in the U.S.).<ref>{{cite book |author1=Chandra, A |author2=Skinner, JS | title= Geography and Racial Health Disparities, Chapter 16 of Critical Perspectives on Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life. |year=2004|publisher=National Research Council|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6555551.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/data/region/| title=Data by Region, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care|accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> There is ongoing debate as to the relative contributions of race, gender, poverty, education level and place to these variations.

These programs work to address the needs of the people in their region, as well as assist their local community based organizations and social services to gather data, address health disparities, and explore evidence-based interventions that will ultimately lead to better health for everyone.

Located at the southwestern tip of the island of [[Kyushu]], Kagoshima is the largest city in the prefecture by some margin. It has been nicknamed the \"[[Naples]] of the [[Eastern world]]\" for its bay location ([[Aira Caldera]]), hot climate, and emblematic [[stratovolcano]], [[Sakurajima]]. The city was officially founded on April 1, 1889.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bombing of Kagoshima Map - 1863.PNG|thumb|Map of the [[Bombardment of Kagoshima]] on 15 to 18 August 1863]]\n[[File:Kagoshima 1914.jpg|thumb|The city covered deep in ash after the 1914 eruption of the [[Sakurajima]] volcano which is seen in the distance across the bay]]\n\nKagoshima Prefecture (also known as the [[Satsuma Domain]]) was the center of the territory of the [[Shimazu clan]] for many centuries. It was a busy political and commercial port city throughout the medieval period and into the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868) when it formally became the capital of the Shimazu's [[''han'' (country subdivision)|fief]], the Satsuma Domain. The official emblem is a modification of the Shimazu's [[''Mon'' (emblem)|kamon]] designed to resemble the character \u5e02 (''shi'', \"city\"). Satsuma remained one of the most powerful and wealthiest domains in the country throughout the period, and though international trade was [[sakoku|banned]] for much of this period, the city remained quite active and prosperous. It served not only as the political center for Satsuma, but also for the semi-independent vassal kingdom of [[Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom|Ry\u016bky\u016b]]; [[Ryukyuan people|Ry\u016bky\u016ban]] traders and emissaries frequented the city, and a special [[Ry\u016bky\u016b-kan|Ryukyuan embassy building]] was established to help administer relations between the two [[polity|polities]] and to house visitors and emissaries. Kagoshima was also a significant center of [[Kirishitan|Christian]] activity in Japan prior to the imposition of bans against that religion in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.\n\n[[Bombardment of Kagoshima|Kagoshima was bombarded]] by the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1863 to punish the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]] for the murder of [[Charles Lennox Richardson]] on the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d (road)|T\u014dkaid\u014d]] highway the previous year and its refusal to pay an indemnity in compensation.\n\nKagoshima was the birthplace and scene of the [[last stand]] of [[Saig\u014d Takamori]], a legendary figure in [[Meiji Era]] Japan in 1877 at the end of the [[Satsuma Rebellion]].\n\nJapan's industrial revolution is said to have started here, stimulated by the young students' train station. Seventeen young men of Satsuma broke the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] ban on foreign travel, traveling first to England and then the United States before returning to share the benefits of the best of Western science and technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2fQYReqBNIC&pg=PA271&dq=Seventeen+young+men+of+Satsuma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6nfbzuojaAhXFz4MKHVfWDoEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=Seventeen+young+men+of+Satsuma&f=false|title=Collected Writings of Modern Western Scholars on Japan: Carmen Blacker, Hugh Cortazzi and Ben-Ami Shillony|first1=Carmen|last1=Blacker|first2=Hugh|last2=Cortazzi|date=1 September 1999|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> A statue was erected outside the train station as a tribute to them.\n\nKagoshima was also the birthplace of [[T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d]]. After naval studies in [[England]] between 1871 and 1878, Togo's role as Chief Admiral of the Grand Fleet of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] made him a legend in Japanese military history, and earned him the nickname '[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]] of the Orient' in Britain. He led the Grand Fleet to two startling victories in 1904 and 1905, completely destroying Russia as a naval power in the East, and thereby contributing to the failed [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolution in Russia]] in 1905.\n\nThe Japanese diplomat [[Sadomitsu Sakoguchi]] revolutionized Kagoshima's environmental economic plan with his dissertation on water pollution and orange harvesting.\n\nThe 1914 eruption of the volcano across the bay from the city spread ash throughout the municipality, but relatively little disruption ensued.<ref>\"Kagoshima\", ''Illustrated London News.'' 24 January 1914.</ref>\n\nThe name \"Kagoshima\" (\u9e7f\u5150\u5cf6) literally means \"deer child island\" or \"young-deer island\".\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn the night of June 17, 1945 the 314th bombardment wing of the Army Air Corps (120 B-29s) dropped 809.6 tons of incendiary and cluster bombs destroying {{convert|2.11|mi2|2|abbr=out}} of Kagoshima (44.1 percent of the built-up area). Kagoshima was targeted because of its largely expanded naval port as well as its position as a railway terminus. A single B-29 was lost to unknown circumstances. Area bombing was chosen over precision bombing because of the cloudy weather over Japan during the middle of June. The planes were forced to navigate and bomb entirely by radar.<ref>Headquarters, XXI Bomber Command APO 234, \"Tactical Mission Report Mission No. 206-209.\"  June 18, 1945.</ref>\n\nJapanese intelligence predicted that the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] would [[Operation Downfall|assault]] Kagoshima and the [[Ariake Bay]] areas of southern [[Kyushu]] to gain naval and air-bases to strike Tokyo.\n\n==Geography==\nKagoshima City is approximately 40 minutes from [[Kagoshima Airport]], and features shopping districts and malls located wide across the city. Transportation options in the city include the ''[[Shinkansen]]'' (bullet train), local train, city trams, buses, and ferries to-and-from Sakurajima. The large and modern Kagoshima City Aquarium, situated near a shopping district known as \"Dolphin Port\" and the Sakurajima Ferry Terminal, was established in 1997 along the docks and offers a direct view of Sakurajima. One of the best places to view the city (and Sakurajima) is from the [[Amuran|Amuran Ferris wheel]] atop of [[Amu Plaza Kagoshima]], and the shopping center attached to the central [[Kagoshima-Ch\u016b\u014d Station]].

The warm weather and diverse environments allow for the agriculture and aquaculture of Kagoshima to thrive and gain nationwide and worldwide recognition for unique and quality products. Numerous restaurants around Kagoshima feature [[Satsuma Province]] local cuisine. Popular cuisine incorporating local agriculture include ''kibinago\u3000sashimi'' (silver-striped herring), ''buri'' Amberjack, ''kampachi'' yellowtail, \"Black Label Products\" such as ''kuro-ushi'' Wagyu beef, ''kuro-buta'' Berkshire pork dishes, and ''kuro-Satsuma jidori'' chicken (sometimes served as raw, chicken ''sashimi''); smoked eel, keihan, and ''miki'' (fermented rice milk consumed among residents of the [[Amami Islands]]).\n\n==== Satsuma age ====\n[[Satsuma age]], or deep-fried fish cake, comes in great variety in Kagoshima. Though the deep-fried fishcake can be found throughout the country, the Satsuma Domain (modern-day Kagoshima Prefecture) is commonly believed to be the birthplace of the snack. It is said, though, the concept was introduced from the Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom (modern-day Okinawa Prefecture) by Satsuma Lord, Nariakira Shimazu.\n\n==== Sweets ====\nThere are many types of sweets produced in Kagoshima Prefecture. {{Nihongo|Kagoshima-based Seika Foods Co., Ltd.|\u30bb\u30a4\u30ab\u98df\u54c1\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Seika shokuhin kabushiki-kaisha}} has produced some of Japan's most popular and timeless sweets such as {{Nihongo|[[hy\u014droku mochi]] ''Bontan Ame''|\u30dc\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u30a2\u30e1}}, {{Nihongo|''Satsuma Imo'' Caramel|\u3055\u3064\u307e\u3044\u3082\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30e1\u30eb}}, and green tea-flavored Hy\u014droku mochi, Minami \"[[shirokuma]]\" shaved ice desserts, etc. Traditional treats outside of Seika Food Co., Ltd. products include ''[[karukan]]'' (sweet cakes made from steamed yams and rice flour), [http://kic-update.com/en/travel/jambo-mochi/ ''jambo-mochi''], ''kokut\u014d'' brown sugar from the Amami Islands, ''getanha'' brown sugar cake, etc.\n\n==== Beverages ====\n[[File:Kagoshima City Hall 1.jpg|thumb|Kagoshima City Hall]]\nIn 1559, at {{Nihongo|K\u014driyama Hachiman Shrine|\u90e1\u5c71\u516b\u5e61\u795e\u793e}} in {{Nihongo|Izumi City|\u4f0a\u4f50\u5e02}} a carpenter wrote atop a wooden board \"the Shint\u014d Priest of this shrine is too stingy to offer me {{Nihongo3||\u713c\u914e|[[Sh\u014dch\u016b]]}} showing an early love for the spirits. Kagoshima Prefecture is officially recognized (by the World Trade Organization) as the home to one of the most traditional beverages of Japan, ''sh\u014dch\u016b''. In Kagoshima there are 113+ distilleries, producing about 1,500 highly acclaimed brands, placing Kagoshima in the top for production quantity and shipment. While visiting Kagoshima, one may notice labels reading {{Nihongo3||\u672c\u683c\u713c\u914e|Honkaku-sh\u014dch\u016b}}. ''Honkaku-sh\u014dch\u016b'' is a distilled beverage produced with traditional skills using ingredients such as natural spring water, sweet potatoes, locally grown sugar cane, and grains. There is a variety of ''honkaku-sh\u014dch\u016b'' including {{Nihongo3||\u828b\u713c\u914e|Imo-j\u014dch\u016b}}, ''sh\u014dch\u016b'' distilled from sweet potatoes), {{Nihongo3||\u9ea6\u713c\u914e|Mugi-j\u014dch\u016b}}, distilled from barley), {{Nihongo3||\u7c73\u713c\u914e|Kome-j\u014dch\u016b}}, distilled from rice), etc. Another type of ''sh\u014dch\u016b'' is {{Nihongo3||\u9ed2\u7cd6\u713c\u914e|Kokut\u014d-sh\u014dch\u016b}}, ''sh\u014dch\u016b'' distilled with brown sugar). ''Sh\u014dch\u016b'' has long gained international favor and has come to be comparable to Bordeaux for wine, Scotch for whiskey, and Cognac for brandy. Also, the Amami Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture are the only areas sanctioned to bear the label of ''kokut\u014d-sh\u014dch\u016b''.\n\n{{Nihongo3||\u9ed2\u9162|Kurozu}} or black vinegar is another item of the \"Black Label Products\" of Kagoshima, the other of which is ''Kokut\u014d-sh\u014dch\u016b''. There are a number of ''kurozu'' farms around Kagoshima, most of which are located around the [[Kirishima, Kagoshima|Kirishima]] area. Most ''kurozu'' farms produce ''kurozu'' bottled vinegar (fermented for a single year, 2+ years) along with other items such as salad dressing, powders, capsules, spices, candy, etc. ''Kurozu'' also comes in different flavors such as grape, orange, ''ume plum'', etc. though the most popular flavor by far is apple. The farms are open to visitations and often offer tours.\n\n=== Dialect ===\nToday, Kagoshima is home to a distinctive dialect of Japanese known as {{Nihongo|Satsug\u016b dialect|\u85a9\u9685\u65b9\u8a00 |Satsug\u016b H\u014dgen}} or {{Nihongo|[[Kagoshima dialect]]|\u9e7f\u5150\u5cf6\u5f01|Kagoshima-ben}}, differing from the usual [[Kyushu]] dialects with its pronunciations of the [[yotsugana]].\n\n=== Points of interest ===\n[[File:Tenmonkan G3 Kagoshima Japan.jpg|thumb|Tenmonkan G3]]\n\n* [[Ishibashi Park]]\n* Kagoshima Aquarium\n* [[Kagoshima Botanical Garden]]\n* [[Museum of the Meiji Restoration]]\n* Sengan-en Garden\n* Tenmonkan shopping arcade\n\n=== Events and festivals ===\n* [http://www.ibusuki-nanohana.com/marathon/ Ibusuki Nanohana Marathon] (\u3044\u3076\u3059\u304d\u83dc\u306e\u82b1\u30de\u30e9\u30bd\u30f3, January)\n* [http://www.japanvisitor.com/japan-parks-gardens/senganen-garden Senganen Garden Classical Poetry Party] (\u4ed9\u5dcc\u5712\u306e\u300c\u66f2\u6c34\u306e\u5bb4\u300d, June)\n* [http://www.kagoshima-kankou.com/for/whatsnew/2010/04/fukiage-hama-beach-sand-sculpture-and-flower-festival-2010.html Fukiage Sand Festival] (''Fukiagehama suna-no-saiten text''\u5439\u4e0a\u6d5c\u7802\u306e\u796d\u5178, May)\n* [[Spider fighting#Japan|Spider Fighting]] (''Kumo Gassen'' \u304f\u3082\u5408\u6226\u5927\u4f1a, June)\n* Kinko Bay Summer Nite Fireworks Show (July)\n* [http://kic-update.com/en/whatup/ogionsaa-%E3%81%8A%E3%81%8E%E3%81%8A%E3%82%93%E3%81%95%E3%81%82-2/ ''Ogionsaa'' Festival] (\u304a\u304e\u304a\u3093\u3055\u3041, July)\n* [http://www.kagoshima-kankou.com/for/whatsnew/2014/07/rokugatsudo-summer-lantern-festival.html ''Rokugatsud\u014d'' Festival] (\u516d\u6708\u706f, July)\n* [http://www.city.kagoshima.lg.jp/gaikokugo/english/tourism/event.html ''S\u014dgadon-no-kasayaki'' Umbrella Burning Festival] (\u66fd\u6211\u3069\u3093\u306e\u5098\u713c\u304d, July)\n* Sendai City Great Tug-of-War (''Sendai \u014c-tsunahiki'' \u5ddd\u5185\u5927\u7db1\u5f15, September)\n* [http://www.kagoshima-kankou.com/for/whatsnew/2012/10/ohara-matsuri---a-dance-festival-attended-by-20000.html Kagoshima ''\u014chara'' Festival] (November)\n[[File:Ohara Festival 2011.JPG|thumb|Kagoshima \u014chara Dancing Festival in November]] \n* 2015 [[National Cultural Festival]] (October\u2013November |Official Website: https://web.archive.org/web/20180809034206/http://kagoshima-kokubunsai.jp/)\n\n== Education ==\n\n===High schools===\n* [[Japanese La Salle Academy]]\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Kagoshima-Chuo Station 20180505.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Kagoshima-Ch\u016b\u014d Station]]]]\n[[File:\u9ad8\u898b\u99ac\u5834 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|200px|Kagoshima city tram Taniyama Line]]\n[[File:Ibusuki Skyline Ends.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Kyushu Expressway]]]]\n\n=== Railways ===\nAll lines are operated by [[Kyushu Railway Company]] (JR Kyushu)\n*[[Kyushu Shinkansen]]\n** [[Kagoshima-Ch\u016b\u014d Station]]\n*[[Kagoshima Main Line]]\n** [[Satsuma-Matsumoto Station]] \u2013 [[Kami-Ijuin Station]] \u2013 [[Hiroki Station]] \u2013 Kagoshima-Chuo Station \u2013 [[Kagoshima Station]]\n*[[Nippo Main Line]]\n** [[Ryugamizu Station]] \u2013 Kagoshima Station\n*[[Ibusuki Makurazaki Line]]\n** Kagoshima-Chuo Station \u2013 [[Korimoto Station (JR Kyushu)|Korimoto Station]] \u2013 [[Minami-Kagoshima Station]] \u2013 [[Usuki Station (Kagoshima)|Usuki Station]] \u2013 [[Taniyama Station (JR Kyushu)|Taniyama Station]] \u2013 [[Jigenji Station]] \u2013 [[Sakanoue Station]] \u2013 [[Goino Station]] \u2013 [[Hirakawa Station]] \u2013 [[Sesekushi Station]] \u2013 [[Nakamyo Station]] \u2013 [[Kiire Station]] \u2013 [[Maenohama Station]] \u2013 [[Nukumi Station]]\n\n=== Tramway ===\n*[[Kagoshima City Transportation Bureau]] Taniyama Line\n*[[Kagoshima City Transportation Bureau]] Korimoto Line\n\n=== Highways ===\n*[[Route 3 (Japan)|National Route 3]]\n*[[Route 10 (Japan)|National Route 10]]\n*[[Route 58 (Japan)|National Route 58]]\n*[[Route 224 (Japan)|National Route 224]]\n*[[Route 225 (Japan)|National Route 225]]\n*[[Route 226 (Japan)|National Route 226]]\n*[[Route 328 (Japan)|National Route 328]]\n*[[Kyushu Expressway]]\n*[[Minami-Kyushu Expressway]]\n*Ibusuki Skyline\n\n=== Bus ===\n*Kagoshima City Bus\n*Kagoshima Kotsu\n*Iwasaki Bus Network\n*Nangoku Kotsu\n*JR Kyushu bus\n*MTA Bus\n\n=== Ferry/Jetfoil ===\n*[[Sakurajima Ferry]]\n*A Line (to southern islands)\n*Marix Line (to southern islands)\n*RKK Line (to Okinawa, cargo only)\n*Toppy (to [[Tanegashima]] and [[Yakushima]])\n*Seahawk (to Koshikijima Islands)\n\n===Airport===\n[[Kagoshima Airport]] in [[Kirishima, Kagoshima|Kirishima]] ({{convert|35|km|0|abbr=in}} NE of Kagoshima)\n\n==Sports==\nKagoshima was one of the host cities of the official [[1998 Women's Volleyball World Championship]].

Located at the southwestern tip of the island of [[Kyushu]], Kagoshima is the largest city in the prefecture by some margin. It has been nicknamed the \"[[Naples]] of the [[Eastern world]]\" for its bay location ([[Aira Caldera]]), hot climate, and emblematic [[stratovolcano]], [[Sakurajima]]. The city was officially founded on April 1, 1889.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bombing of Kagoshima Map - 1863.PNG|thumb|Map of the [[Bombardment of Kagoshima]] on 15 to 18 August 1863]]\n[[File:Kagoshima 1914.jpg|thumb|The city covered deep in ash after the 1914 eruption of the [[Sakurajima]] volcano which is seen in the distance across the bay]]\n\nKagoshima Prefecture (also known as the [[Satsuma Domain]]) was the center of the territory of the [[Shimazu clan]] for many centuries. It was a busy political and commercial port city throughout the medieval period and into the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868) when it formally became the capital of the Shimazu's [[''han'' (country subdivision)|fief]], the Satsuma Domain. The official emblem is a modification of the Shimazu's [[''Mon'' (emblem)|kamon]] designed to resemble the character \u5e02 (''shi'', \"city\"). Satsuma remained one of the most powerful and wealthiest domains in the country throughout the period, and though international trade was [[sakoku|banned]] for much of this period, the city remained quite active and prosperous. It served not only as the political center for Satsuma, but also for the semi-independent vassal kingdom of [[Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom|Ry\u016bky\u016b]]; [[Ryukyuan people|Ry\u016bky\u016ban]] traders and emissaries frequented the city, and a special [[Ry\u016bky\u016b-kan|Ryukyuan embassy building]] was established to help administer relations between the two [[polity|polities]] and to house visitors and emissaries. Kagoshima was also a significant center of [[Kirishitan|Christian]] activity in Japan prior to the imposition of bans against that religion in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.\n\n[[Bombardment of Kagoshima|Kagoshima was bombarded]] by the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1863 to punish the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]] for the murder of [[Charles Lennox Richardson]] on the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d (road)|T\u014dkaid\u014d]] highway the previous year and its refusal to pay an indemnity in compensation.\n\nKagoshima was the birthplace and scene of the [[last stand]] of [[Saig\u014d Takamori]], a legendary figure in [[Meiji Era]] Japan in 1877 at the end of the [[Satsuma Rebellion]].\n\nJapan's industrial revolution is said to have started here, stimulated by the young students' train station. Seventeen young men of Satsuma broke the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] ban on foreign travel, traveling first to England and then the United States before returning to share the benefits of the best of Western science and technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2fQYReqBNIC&pg=PA271&dq=Seventeen+young+men+of+Satsuma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6nfbzuojaAhXFz4MKHVfWDoEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=Seventeen+young+men+of+Satsuma&f=false|title=Collected Writings of Modern Western Scholars on Japan: Carmen Blacker, Hugh Cortazzi and Ben-Ami Shillony|first1=Carmen|last1=Blacker|first2=Hugh|last2=Cortazzi|date=1 September 1999|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> A statue was erected outside the train station as a tribute to them.\n\nKagoshima was also the birthplace of [[T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d]]. After naval studies in [[England]] between 1871 and 1878, Togo's role as Chief Admiral of the Grand Fleet of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] made him a legend in Japanese military history, and earned him the nickname '[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]] of the Orient' in Britain. He led the Grand Fleet to two startling victories in 1904 and 1905, completely destroying Russia as a naval power in the East, and thereby contributing to the failed [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolution in Russia]] in 1905.\n\nThe Japanese diplomat [[Sadomitsu Sakoguchi]] revolutionized Kagoshima's environmental economic plan with his dissertation on water pollution and orange harvesting.\n\nThe 1914 eruption of the volcano across the bay from the city spread ash throughout the municipality, but relatively little disruption ensued.<ref>\"Kagoshima\", ''Illustrated London News.'' 24 January 1914.</ref>\n\nThe name \"Kagoshima\" (\u9e7f\u5150\u5cf6) literally means \"deer child island\" or \"young-deer island\".\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn the night of June 17, 1945 the 314th bombardment wing of the Army Air Corps (120 B-29s) dropped 809.6 tons of incendiary and cluster bombs destroying {{convert|2.11|mi2|2|abbr=out}} of Kagoshima (44.1 percent of the built-up area). Kagoshima was targeted because of its largely expanded naval port as well as its position as a railway terminus. A single B-29 was lost to unknown circumstances. Area bombing was chosen over precision bombing because of the cloudy weather over Japan during the middle of June. The planes were forced to navigate and bomb entirely by radar.<ref>Headquarters, XXI Bomber Command APO 234, \"Tactical Mission Report Mission No. 206-209.\"  June 18, 1945.</ref>\n\nJapanese intelligence predicted that the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] would [[Operation Downfall|assault]] Kagoshima and the [[Ariake Bay]] areas of southern [[Kyushu]] to gain naval and air-bases to strike Tokyo.\n\n==Geography==\nKagoshima City is approximately 40 minutes from [[Kagoshima Airport]], and features shopping districts and malls located wide across the city. Transportation options in the city include the ''[[Shinkansen]]'' (bullet train), local train, city trams, buses, and ferries to-and-from Sakurajima. The large and modern Kagoshima City Aquarium, situated near a shopping district known as \"Dolphin Port\" and the Sakurajima Ferry Terminal, was established in 1997 along the docks and offers a direct view of Sakurajima. One of the best places to view the city (and Sakurajima) is from the [[Amuran|Amuran Ferris wheel]] atop of [[Amu Plaza Kagoshima]], and the shopping center attached to the central [[Kagoshima-Ch\u016b\u014d Station]]. Just outside the city is the early-Edo Period [[Sengan-en]] Japanese Garden. The garden was originally a villa belonging to the [[Shimazu clan]] and is still maintained by descendants today.

The warm weather and diverse environments allow for the agriculture and aquaculture of Kagoshima to thrive and gain nationwide and worldwide recognition for unique and quality products. Numerous restaurants around Kagoshima feature [[Satsuma Province]] local cuisine. Popular cuisine incorporating local agriculture include ''kibinago\u3000sashimi'' (silver-striped herring), ''buri'' Amberjack, ''kampachi'' yellowtail, \"Black Label Products\" such as ''kuro-ushi'' Wagyu beef, ''kuro-buta'' Berkshire pork dishes, and ''kuro-Satsuma jidori'' chicken (sometimes served as raw, chicken ''sashimi''); smoked eel, keihan, and ''miki'' (fermented rice milk consumed among residents of the [[Amami Islands]]).\n\n==== Satsuma age ====\n[[Satsuma age]], or deep-fried fish cake, comes in great variety in Kagoshima. Though the deep-fried fishcake can be found throughout the country, the Satsuma Domain (modern-day Kagoshima Prefecture) is commonly believed to be the birthplace of the snack.

In Kagoshima there are 113+ distilleries, producing about 1,500 highly acclaimed brands, placing Kagoshima in the top for production quantity and shipment. While visiting Kagoshima, one may notice labels reading {{Nihongo3||\u672c\u683c\u713c\u914e|Honkaku-sh\u014dch\u016b}}. ''Honkaku-sh\u014dch\u016b'' is a distilled beverage produced with traditional skills using ingredients such as natural spring water, sweet potatoes, locally grown sugar cane, and grains. There is a variety of ''honkaku-sh\u014dch\u016b'' including {{Nihongo3||\u828b\u713c\u914e|Imo-j\u014dch\u016b}}, ''sh\u014dch\u016b'' distilled from sweet potatoes), {{Nihongo3||\u9ea6\u713c\u914e|Mugi-j\u014dch\u016b}}, distilled from barley), {{Nihongo3||\u7c73\u713c\u914e|Kome-j\u014dch\u016b}}, distilled from rice), etc. Another type of ''sh\u014dch\u016b'' is {{Nihongo3||\u9ed2\u7cd6\u713c\u914e|Kokut\u014d-sh\u014dch\u016b}}, ''sh\u014dch\u016b'' distilled with brown sugar). ''Sh\u014dch\u016b'' has long gained international favor and has come to be comparable to Bordeaux for wine, Scotch for whiskey, and Cognac for brandy. Also, the Amami Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture are the only areas sanctioned to bear the label of ''kokut\u014d-sh\u014dch\u016b''.\n\n{{Nihongo3||\u9ed2\u9162|Kurozu}} or black vinegar is another item of the \"Black Label Products\" of Kagoshima, the other of which is ''Kokut\u014d-sh\u014dch\u016b''. There are a number of ''kurozu'' farms around Kagoshima, most of which are located around the [[Kirishima, Kagoshima|Kirishima]] area. Most ''kurozu'' farms produce ''kurozu'' bottled vinegar (fermented for a single year, 2+ years) along with other items such as salad dressing, powders, capsules, spices, candy, etc. ''Kurozu'' also comes in different flavors such as grape, orange, ''ume plum'', etc. though the most popular flavor by far is apple.
