From here, border proceeds along the limit of I\u0142\u0142ukszta county to Daugava river and passes on its right bank (Vitebsk Governorate) in order to proceed eastward parallel to the river, and approximately 30 kilometers to the borders of the Dry\u015bwiaty county, including same, along with the [[Polock]] county. Next it passes the north-west from Horodka, returns to the left bank of the Daugava River about 30 miles west of Vitebsk and goes toward the south, passing west of the Sienna to the point where it meets the boundary between Minsk and Mohylow Gouvernement, proceeding from the boundary line towards the south until the Berezina in place where it touches the northern border of the Rzeczyca county, then crossing the Berezina, goes in a southwesterly direction to the marshes to the east of Mazyr. From there, crossing Pripyat, the boundary follows the dividing line between the Rzeczyca and Mazyr counties, then, is still proceeding in a south west, passes to the west to the cities of Zwiahel and Ovruch in Volhynia and arrives at the point where the borders of Zaslaw, Ostrog and Zwiahel counties meet. Then, heading south, the frontier line is progressing along the eastern border of Zaslaw and Starokonstantyn\u00f3w counties, to the point where it meets boundaries of Latycz\u00f3w and Ploskir\u00f3w counties in Podolia, there is still in a southerly direction until it reaches the river Uszyca near Zi\u0144k\u00f3w and goes along its course to the Dniester, which is at this point the southern border between Poland and Romania.}} \n\nThis proposal was rejected, and later withdrawn by the author, Roman Dmowski, who, during the negotiations ending the Polish-Bolshevik war, spoke out against the inclusion of Minsk.

Screen]] from September 17, 2009, to June 2, 2015. The series follows an [[ensemble cast]] of characters played by [[Joel McHale]], [[Gillian Jacobs]], [[Danny Pudi]], [[Yvette Nicole Brown]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Ken Jeong]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Jim Rash]] at a [[community college]] in the fictional town of Greendale, [[Colorado]]. It makes heavy use of [[Meta-joke|meta-humor]] and [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Meta-reference|references]], often parodying film and television clich\u00e9s and [[trope (literature)|tropes]].\n\nHarmon based the program on his own experiences attending a community college. Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's \"story circle\" template, a method designed to create effective, structured storytelling. Harmon served as the series' [[showrunner]] for its first three seasons, but was fired prior to the fourth and replaced by writers David Guarascio and Moses Port. After a lukewarm response to the fourth season from fans and critics, Harmon was re-hired for the show's fifth broadcast season, after which it was canceled by NBC. Yahoo! Screen commissioned its sixth and final season, which concluded on June 2, 2015.\n\n''Community'' received critical acclaim for its acting and writing, appeared on numerous critics' year-end \"best-of\" lists for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015, and developed a [[cult following]].\n\n==Premise==\nJeff Winger is [[disbarred]] and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered that he lied about possessing a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Columbia University]]. He enrolls at Greendale Community College to earn a legitimate degree. Jeff quickly becomes attracted to his [[Activism|activist]] classmate, Britta Perry, and pretends to run a [[study group]] in order to spend time with her.\n\nHowever, things don't go to plan when she invites Abed Nadir, a [[popular culture|pop culture]]-lover with [[Asperger syndrome]], who brings other classmates along: Shirley Bennett, a highly religious [[Single parent|single mother]]; [[Naivety|na\u00efve]] [[Overachievement|over-achiever]] Annie Edison; former high school football star Troy Barnes; and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] elderly millionaire Pierce Hawthorne. Despite their differences, the members of the group soon become close friends.\n\nWhile taking select classes together semester after semester, the group members are often roped into helping the college's flamboyant Dean, Craig Pelton, in his schemes to make the school seem more respectable, as well as having to deal with the antics of their [[Mental disorder|unstable]] teacher (and eventual classmate) Ben Chang.\n\nSeason 1 follows Jeff's creation of the study group and their subsequent misadventures. Season 2 continues their second year at Greendale. Chang is forced to enroll as a student and tries to join the study group, while secretly planning revenge against them. Meanwhile, Dean Pelton is forced to fight for Greendale's sense of pride against Dean Spreck of rival school City College, eventually culminating in a desperate paintball battle. In season 3, the school is threatened by Chang, who puts together a villainous plot to take over the school. Troy also must struggle with whether or not to attend the cult-like Air-Conditioning Repair School.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Community characters}}\nThe show features an [[ensemble cast]] of characters, focusing on the members of a study group and a recurring group of faculty of Greendale Community College, including the dean.\n\n* [[Joel McHale]] as Jeff Winger, a former lawyer who enrolls at Greendale after being suspended by the [[State bar association|state bar]] for falsely claiming to have a [[bachelor's degree]]. Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident, [[narcissistic|narcissist]] [[lothario]] who constantly manipulates people to get what he wants, which is often to not do any work. However, as he becomes closer to his new study group he changes some of his habits and views. He is more willing to make personal sacrifices for his friends over time and selectively reveals that he can be more patient and less critical than what other [[alpha (ethology)|alpha-males]] typically offer.\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Britta Perry, an [[anarchist]], [[atheist]], and [[Activism|activist]] who traveled around the world after dropping out of high school. Britta puts forth a strong effort to come off as proactive, intelligent, and mature to others, but she usually just comes off as pretentious and hypocritical in her views, especially those concerning her goal to become a [[therapist]]. Despite not being as worldly or well-informed an activist as she thinks she is, Britta does have a genuine and powerful desire to help others, and has significant enthusiasm and energy in what she puts her efforts into (whether appropriate or misplaced).\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Abed Nadir, a film student of Palestinian and Polish descent, with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via normal means, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film and TV [[clich\u00e9s]]. Despite being out-of-touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behavior and often the wisest member of the group.\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Shirley Bennett (main cast, seasons 1\u20135; recurring, season 6), a single mother and vocal [[Christianity|Christian]] going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is seen as the \"mother\" of the group, but she can often be overbearing in her desire to help and guide her friends. Despite having a hot temper and starting the series off as being apprehensive towards different religious views or lack thereof, Shirley is a very kind-hearted person with a strong set of morals.\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Annie Edison, the youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever, relentlessly organized and comparatively [[Ingenue (stock character)|innocent]]. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted to [[Adderall]], which has caused her to be very [[Generalised anxiety disorder|anxious]] and desperate to prove herself in a variety of extra-curricular groups despite already being considered naturally intelligent and attractive by others. She is normally genial and laid-back, but can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve or is denied something she strongly cares about, even if it's about something as simple as a pen.\n* [[Donald Glover]] as Troy Barnes (seasons 1\u20135), a former high school star quarterback who lost his scholarship to a top-tier university when he separated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he actually did on purpose in order to escape the pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy starts the series trying to appear cool and acting like a bully and a stereotypical football player, but because of the influence of Abed (who quickly becomes his best friend), he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his [[nerd]]y and carefree side.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Ben Chang, an extremely unstable teacher at Greendale. Chang's insanity often leads him to take extreme action for no apparent reason and he has alternatively been a friend and foe of the study group.\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Pierce Hawthorne (main cast, seasons 1\u20134; guest, season 5), a millionaire who enrolls at Greendale out of boredom and a passive attempt at self-discovery. Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the study group because of his arrogance, lack of empathy and casual narrow-mindedness. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, partly due to his own family's emotionally distant and dysfunctional relationship with him.\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Craig Pelton (recurring, seasons 1\u20132; main cast, seasons 3\u20136), the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of Greendale, who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university and goes to extreme lengths to try to make it fun and politically correct, while frequently explaining his many unresolved business decisions.  Although he never explicitly mentions his sexual orientation (he is once described as a \"[[Pansexuality|pansexual]] imp\" by Vice Dean Robert Laybourne), he is an avid [[Cross-dressing|cross-dresser]], who makes constant and open attempts to flirt with and touch Jeff. The study group is by far the Dean's favorite group of students, and he is constantly making up excuses to dress up and come talk to them.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Community episodes}}\n{{:List of Community episodes}}\nMost episodes feature titles designed to sound like the names of college courses such as \"Introduction to Film\", \"Anthropology 101\" and \"Cooperative Calligraphy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/05/the_one_with_all_the_titles.html|title=The One With All the Episode-Title Formulas|work=NY Mag|publisher=Vulture|first=Margaret|last=Lyons|date=May 6, 2011|accessdate=August 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120134202/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/05/the_one_with_all_the_titles.html|archive-date=November 20, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe first season premiered on September 17, 2009, in the 9:30 pm ET Thursday timeslot.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Mitovich |title=Fall TV: NBC Announces Premiere Dates |url=https://tvguide.com/News/FallTV-NBC-premieres-1007251.aspx |work=TV Guide |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626200856/http://www.tvguide.com/News/FallTV-NBC-premieres-1007251.aspx |archive-date=June 26, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> After three episodes, the show was moved to the 8:00 pm ET timeslot.

Though initially not partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded by the quality of the show's writing to take the job.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show.

He commented that \"Dan's script was so head and shoulders above everything else that I was reading.\"<ref name=\"FB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fanbolt.com/headline/7258/Interview:_Joel_McHale___Dan_Harmon_from_Community|title=Joel McHale & Dan Harmon of Community|last=Loggins|first=Emma|date=October 19, 2009|work=Fanbolt|accessdate=October 25, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710223702/http://www.fanbolt.com/headline/7258/Interview%3A_Joel_McHale___Dan_Harmon_from_Community|archivedate=July 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> McHale appealed to Harmon because of his likable quality, which allowed the character to possess certain unsympathetic traits without turning the viewer against him.<ref name=\"AV\"/> For the role of Annie, Harmon wanted someone who would resemble [[Tracy Flick]], [[Reese Witherspoon]]'s character from the 1999 movie ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]''. Originally the producers were looking for a Latina or Asian Tracy Flick, but could not find any. Instead they ended up casting [[Alison Brie]], known for her role as Trudy Campbell on ''[[Mad Men]]''.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Harmon (14790686643).jpg|thumb|175px|left|Series creator Dan Harmon]]\n\n===Development===\nHarmon based the premise of ''Community'' on his own real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his relationship with his then-girlfriend, he enrolled in [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]] northeast of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon got involved in a study group and, somewhat against his own instincts, became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. \"I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them,\" he explains, \"even though they had nothing to do with the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them.\"<ref name=\"AV\"/> With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realized the value of connecting with other people.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\nAbout the creative process behind the writing, Harmon says that he had to write the show as if it were a movie, not a sitcom. Essentially, the process was no different from the earlier work he had done, except for the length and the target demographic.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nEach episode of ''Community'' is written in accordance with [[Dan Harmon]]'s template of \"story circles\" that he developed while at [[Channel 101]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon/|title=How Dan Harmon Drives Himself Crazy Making Community|last=Raftery|first=Brian|date=September 22, 2011|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=May 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516155548/http://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon|archive-date=May 16, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> This writing method was continued through the fourth season without him.

Screen]] from September 17, 2009, to June 2, 2015. The series follows an [[ensemble cast]] of characters played by [[Joel McHale]], [[Gillian Jacobs]], [[Danny Pudi]], [[Yvette Nicole Brown]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Ken Jeong]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Jim Rash]] at a [[community college]] in the fictional town of Greendale, [[Colorado]]. It makes heavy use of [[Meta-joke|meta-humor]] and [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Meta-reference|references]], often parodying film and television clich\u00e9s and [[trope (literature)|tropes]].\n\nHarmon based the program on his own experiences attending a community college. Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's \"story circle\" template, a method designed to create effective, structured storytelling. Harmon served as the series' [[showrunner]] for its first three seasons, but was fired prior to the fourth and replaced by writers David Guarascio and Moses Port. After a lukewarm response to the fourth season from fans and critics, Harmon was re-hired for the show's fifth broadcast season, after which it was canceled by NBC. Yahoo! Screen commissioned its sixth and final season, which concluded on June 2, 2015.\n\n''Community'' received critical acclaim for its acting and writing, appeared on numerous critics' year-end \"best-of\" lists for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015, and developed a [[cult following]].\n\n==Premise==\nJeff Winger is [[disbarred]] and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered that he lied about possessing a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Columbia University]]. He enrolls at Greendale Community College to earn a legitimate degree. Jeff quickly becomes attracted to his [[Activism|activist]] classmate, Britta Perry, and pretends to run a [[study group]] in order to spend time with her.\n\nHowever, things don't go to plan when she invites Abed Nadir, a [[popular culture|pop culture]]-lover with [[Asperger syndrome]], who brings other classmates along: Shirley Bennett, a highly religious [[Single parent|single mother]]; [[Naivety|na\u00efve]] [[Overachievement|over-achiever]] Annie Edison; former high school football star Troy Barnes; and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] elderly millionaire Pierce Hawthorne. Despite their differences, the members of the group soon become close friends.\n\nWhile taking select classes together semester after semester, the group members are often roped into helping the college's flamboyant Dean, Craig Pelton, in his schemes to make the school seem more respectable, as well as having to deal with the antics of their [[Mental disorder|unstable]] teacher (and eventual classmate) Ben Chang.\n\nSeason 1 follows Jeff's creation of the study group and their subsequent misadventures. Season 2 continues their second year at Greendale. Chang is forced to enroll as a student and tries to join the study group, while secretly planning revenge against them. Meanwhile, Dean Pelton is forced to fight for Greendale's sense of pride against Dean Spreck of rival school City College, eventually culminating in a desperate paintball battle. In season 3, the school is threatened by Chang, who puts together a villainous plot to take over the school. Troy also must struggle with whether or not to attend the cult-like Air-Conditioning Repair School.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Community characters}}\nThe show features an [[ensemble cast]] of characters, focusing on the members of a study group and a recurring group of faculty of Greendale Community College, including the dean.\n\n* [[Joel McHale]] as Jeff Winger, a former lawyer who enrolls at Greendale after being suspended by the [[State bar association|state bar]] for falsely claiming to have a [[bachelor's degree]]. Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident, [[narcissistic|narcissist]] [[lothario]] who constantly manipulates people to get what he wants, which is often to not do any work. However, as he becomes closer to his new study group he changes some of his habits and views. He is more willing to make personal sacrifices for his friends over time and selectively reveals that he can be more patient and less critical than what other [[alpha (ethology)|alpha-males]] typically offer.\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Britta Perry, an [[anarchist]], [[atheist]], and [[Activism|activist]] who traveled around the world after dropping out of high school. Britta puts forth a strong effort to come off as proactive, intelligent, and mature to others, but she usually just comes off as pretentious and hypocritical in her views, especially those concerning her goal to become a [[therapist]]. Despite not being as worldly or well-informed an activist as she thinks she is, Britta does have a genuine and powerful desire to help others, and has significant enthusiasm and energy in what she puts her efforts into (whether appropriate or misplaced).\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Abed Nadir, a film student of Palestinian and Polish descent, with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via normal means, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film and TV [[clich\u00e9s]]. Despite being out-of-touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behavior and often the wisest member of the group.\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Shirley Bennett (main cast, seasons 1\u20135; recurring, season 6), a single mother and vocal [[Christianity|Christian]] going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is seen as the \"mother\" of the group, but she can often be overbearing in her desire to help and guide her friends. Despite having a hot temper and starting the series off as being apprehensive towards different religious views or lack thereof, Shirley is a very kind-hearted person with a strong set of morals.\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Annie Edison, the youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever, relentlessly organized and comparatively [[Ingenue (stock character)|innocent]]. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted to [[Adderall]], which has caused her to be very [[Generalised anxiety disorder|anxious]] and desperate to prove herself in a variety of extra-curricular groups despite already being considered naturally intelligent and attractive by others. She is normally genial and laid-back, but can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve or is denied something she strongly cares about, even if it's about something as simple as a pen.\n* [[Donald Glover]] as Troy Barnes (seasons 1\u20135), a former high school star quarterback who lost his scholarship to a top-tier university when he separated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he actually did on purpose in order to escape the pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy starts the series trying to appear cool and acting like a bully and a stereotypical football player, but because of the influence of Abed (who quickly becomes his best friend), he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his [[nerd]]y and carefree side.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Ben Chang, an extremely unstable teacher at Greendale. Chang's insanity often leads him to take extreme action for no apparent reason and he has alternatively been a friend and foe of the study group.\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Pierce Hawthorne (main cast, seasons 1\u20134; guest, season 5), a millionaire who enrolls at Greendale out of boredom and a passive attempt at self-discovery. Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the study group because of his arrogance, lack of empathy and casual narrow-mindedness. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, partly due to his own family's emotionally distant and dysfunctional relationship with him.\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Craig Pelton (recurring, seasons 1\u20132; main cast, seasons 3\u20136), the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of Greendale, who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university and goes to extreme lengths to try to make it fun and politically correct, while frequently explaining his many unresolved business decisions.  Although he never explicitly mentions his sexual orientation (he is once described as a \"[[Pansexuality|pansexual]] imp\" by Vice Dean Robert Laybourne), he is an avid [[Cross-dressing|cross-dresser]], who makes constant and open attempts to flirt with and touch Jeff. The study group is by far the Dean's favorite group of students, and he is constantly making up excuses to dress up and come talk to them.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Community episodes}}\n{{:List of Community episodes}}\nMost episodes feature titles designed to sound like the names of college courses such as \"Introduction to Film\", \"Anthropology 101\" and \"Cooperative Calligraphy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/05/the_one_with_all_the_titles.html|title=The One With All the Episode-Title Formulas|work=NY Mag|publisher=Vulture|first=Margaret|last=Lyons|date=May 6, 2011|accessdate=August 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120134202/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/05/the_one_with_all_the_titles.html|archive-date=November 20, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe first season premiered on September 17, 2009, in the 9:30 pm ET Thursday timeslot.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Mitovich |title=Fall TV: NBC Announces Premiere Dates |url=https://tvguide.com/News/FallTV-NBC-premieres-1007251.aspx |work=TV Guide |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626200856/http://www.tvguide.com/News/FallTV-NBC-premieres-1007251.aspx |archive-date=June 26, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> After three episodes, the show was moved to the 8:00 pm ET timeslot.

Though initially not partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded by the quality of the show's writing to take the job.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show. Though Chase has often been ridiculed for his career choices, Harmon believed this role could be redeeming: \"What makes Chevy and Pierce heroic is this refusal to stop.\"<ref name=\"AV\">{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/milwaukee/articles/how-dan-harmon-went-from-doing-comedysportz-in-mil,34126/|title=How Dan Harmon went from doing ComedySportz in Milwaukee to creating NBC's Community|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=September 19, 2009|work=[[The A.V.

Originally the producers were looking for a Latina or Asian Tracy Flick, but could not find any. Instead they ended up casting [[Alison Brie]], known for her role as Trudy Campbell on ''[[Mad Men]]''.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Harmon (14790686643).jpg|thumb|175px|left|Series creator Dan Harmon]]\n\n===Development===\nHarmon based the premise of ''Community'' on his own real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his relationship with his then-girlfriend, he enrolled in [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]] northeast of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon got involved in a study group and, somewhat against his own instincts, became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. \"I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them,\" he explains, \"even though they had nothing to do with the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them.\"<ref name=\"AV\"/> With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realized the value of connecting with other people.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\nAbout the creative process behind the writing, Harmon says that he had to write the show as if it were a movie, not a sitcom.
