{"title_page": "Orders of magnitude (time)", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2020}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2012}}\nAn [[order of magnitude]] of [[time]] is (usually) a [[decimal]] prefix or decimal order-of-magnitude quantity together with a base unit of time, like a [[microsecond]] or a [[million years]]. In some cases, the order of magnitude may be implied (usually 1), like a \"[[second]]\" or \"[[year]]\". In other cases, the quantity name implies the [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]], like \"[[century]]\". In most cases, the base unit is seconds or years. Prefixes are not usually used with a base unit of years, so we say \"a million years\", not \"a megayear\". Clock time and calendar time have [[duodecimal]] or [[sexagesimal]] '''orders of magnitude''' rather than decimal, i.e. a year is 12 months, and a minute is 60 seconds.\n\ngay\n\nThe smallest meaningful increment of time is the [[Planck time]], the time light takes to traverse the [[Planck distance]], many decimal orders of magnitude smaller than a second.  The largest ''realized'' amount of time, given known scientific data, is the [[age of the universe]], about 13.8 billion years - the time since the [[Big Bang]] as measured in the [[cosmic microwave background]] [[rest frame]].  Those amounts of time together span 60 decimal orders of magnitude.  Metric prefixes are defined spanning 10<sup>\u221224</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup>, 48 decimal orders of magnitude which may be used in conjunction with the metric base unit of second. Metric units of time larger than the second are most commonly seen only in a few scientific contexts such as observational astronomy and materials science although this depends on author; for everyday usage and most other scientific contexts the common units of minutes (60 s), hours (3600 s or 3.6 ks), days (86 400 s), weeks, months, and years (of which there are a number of variations) are commonly used. Weeks, months and years are significantly variable units whose length crucially depends on the choice of [[calendar]] and is often not regular even with a calendar, e.g. [[leap year]]s versus regular years in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. This makes them problematic for use against a linear and regular time scale such as that defined by the SI since it is not clear as to which version of these units we are to be using. Because of this, in the table below we will not use weeks and months and the year we will use is the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] of astronomy, or 365.25 days of 86 400 s exactly, also called an [[annum]] and denoted with the symbol ''a'', whose definition is based on the average length of a year of the [[Julian calendar]] which had one leap year every and always every 4 years against common years of 365 days each. This unit is used, following the convention of [[geological science]], to form larger units of time by the application of SI prefixes to it at least up to ''giga-annum'', or Ga, equal to 1 000 000 000 a ([[short scale]]: one ''billion'' years, [[long scale]]: one ''milliard'' years).\n\n==Less than one second==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|- \n!

In some cases, the order of magnitude may be implied (usually 1), like a \"[[second]]\" or \"[[year]]\". In other cases, the quantity name implies the [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]], like \"[[century]]\". In most cases, the base unit is seconds or years. Prefixes are not usually used with a base unit of years, so we say \"a million years\", not \"a megayear\". Clock time and calendar time have [[duodecimal]] or [[sexagesimal]] '''orders of magnitude''' rather than decimal, i.e. a year is 12 months, and a minute is 60 seconds.\n\nThe smallest meaningful increment of time is the [[Planck time]], the time light takes to traverse the [[Planck distance]], many decimal orders of magnitude smaller than a second.  The largest ''realized'' amount of time, given known scientific data, is the [[age of the universe]], about 13.8 billion years - the time since the [[Big Bang]] as measured in the [[cosmic microwave background]] [[rest frame]].  Those amounts of time together span 60 decimal orders of magnitude.  Metric prefixes are defined spanning 10<sup>\u221224</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup>, 48 decimal orders of magnitude which may be used in conjunction with the metric base unit of second. Metric units of time larger than the second are most commonly seen only in a few scientific contexts such as observational astronomy and materials science although this depends on author; for everyday usage and most other scientific contexts the common units of minutes (60 s), hours (3600 s or 3.6 ks), days (86 400 s), weeks, months, and years (of which there are a number of variations) are commonly used. Weeks, months and years are significantly variable units whose length crucially depends on the choice of [[calendar]] and is often not regular even with a calendar, e.g. [[leap year]]s versus regular years in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. This makes them problematic for use against a linear and regular time scale such as that defined by the SI since it is not clear as to which version of these units we are to be using. Because of this, in the table below we will not use weeks and months and the year we will use is the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] of astronomy, or 365.25 days of 86 400 s exactly, also called an [[annum]] and denoted with the symbol ''a'', whose definition is based on the average length of a year of the [[Julian calendar]] which had one leap year every and always every 4 years against common years of 365 days each. This unit is used, following the convention of [[geological science]], to form larger units of time by the application of SI prefixes to it at least up to ''giga-annum'', or Ga, equal to 1 000 000 000 a ([[short scale]]: one ''billion'' years, [[long scale]]: one ''milliard'' years).\n\n==Less than one second==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|- \n!

Defection by legislators is faced by many other political democracies around the world. Such acts by legislators invite political instability by way of abandonment of one's parent party for various reasons. In most of the democracies, the stability of the government is dependent on the support from Legislators or a coalition of different parties. Such acts of political defection resulting in instability of the sitting government is looked at, as a betrayal of ''Peoples Mandate''. Many countries have adopted different means to tackle the menace of political defections, some through conventions and other by way of Laws. In India, there were several instances, when political instability was inflicted on the people of India, both at the center and states because of political defection by various legislators by splitting the political parties. It was estimated during fourth and fifth general elections, out of 4000 legislators for the parliament and other state and union territories, almost 50 percent of the members defected causing political turmoil in India.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Venkatesh Kumar|first=|date=May 2003|title=Anti-defection Law: Welcome Reforms|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4413541?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=Vol.38 No.19|pages=1837|via=JSTOR}}</ref> To put a hold on such frequent political defections in India. A law was sought to curb defections by legislators.

Further, to address various lacunae in the said act, many constitutional bodies recommended reviewing the law. [[Parliament of India]], in 2003 passed Ninety-first amendment to the Constitution of India strengthening the act by inserting provisions to disqualify the defecting members and barring them to be appointed as ministers for the period of up to the original tenure and disqualifying members defecting from splits caused by one-third of members moving out of a political party.{{sfn|G C.Malhotra|2005|p=Forword}}\n\n== Background ==\n\u201cGovernment is of the people by the people and for the people\", this is how [[Abraham Lincoln]] defined the Democracy. Elections in a democratic country are an important aspect where people cast their ballot and determine which political party shall govern the country or a state. In such scenarios, Political defections poses a major threat to the will of the people.{{sfn|G C.Malhotra|2005|p=5}} Political defections were as common in India, even common during pre-independence India. But ever since 1960, especially, the states added a new facet to the political instability in the country resulting from coalition politics in India. The term ''Aaya Ram Gaya Ram'', was popularized when in 1967, a legislator by name [[Gaya Lal]] changed his allegiance to three different parties in a single day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/anti-defection-law-explained|title=The Anti-Defection Law Explained|last=Relhan|first=Vibhor|date=December 2017|website=PRS Legislative Research|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1957 and 67, it is estimated that, because of a stronghold over power by [[Indian National Congress|Congress (I)]] party, it emerged as a sole beneficiary of the defections by losing 98 of its legislators and gaining 419. However, defections from non-Congress parties did not join any other political parties, instead they formed a separate political party intending to share power.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kashyap|first=Subhash|date=March 1970|title=The Politics of Defection: The Changing Contours of the Political Power Structure in State Politics in India|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2642574?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Asian Survey|volume=Vol.10 No.3|pages=197|via=JSTOR}}</ref> In 1967 elections, approximately 3,500 members were elected to various legislative assemblies and of union territories of them around 550 changed their parent parties by defections.

There was a definite trend in the political landscape of India during the 1970-80s. Whenever there was a Congress-led Government at the center, the regional governments fell like a pack of cards because of the defection of non-Congress elected representatives.

However, experts believed such defections should not be viewed in terms of numbers alone and should be seen in context as to how such defection damage the people's mandate.

Defection by legislators is faced by many other political democracies around the world. Such acts by legislators invite political instability by way of abandonment of one's parent party for various reasons. In most of the democracies, the stability of the government is dependent on the support from Legislators or a coalition of different parties. Such acts of political defection resulting in instability of the sitting government is looked at, as a betrayal of ''Peoples Mandate''. Many countries have adopted different means to tackle the menace of political defections, some through conventions and other by way of Laws. In India, there were several instances, when political instability was inflicted on the people of India, both at the center and states because of political defection by various legislators by splitting the political parties. It was estimated during fourth and fifth general elections, out of 4000 legislators for the parliament and other state and union territories, almost 50 percent of the members defected causing political turmoil in India.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Venkatesh Kumar|first=|date=May 2003|title=Anti-defection Law: Welcome Reforms|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4413541?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=Vol.38 No.19|pages=1837|via=JSTOR}}</ref>. To put a hold on such frequent political defections in India. A law was sought to curb defections by legislators. In 1985, by way of introducing '''''Tenth schedule'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/pdf1/S10.pdf|title=Tenth Schedule|last=|first=|date=1985|website=Govt. of India|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in the 52nd amendment to the [[Constitution of India]], both [[Lok Sabha]] and [[Rajya Sabha]] passed The Anti-defection law. Further, to address various lacunae in the said act, many constitutional bodies recommended reviewing the law. [[Parliament of India]], in 2003 passed Ninety-first amendment to the Constitution of India strengthening the act by inserting provisions to disqualify the defecting members and barring them to be appointed as ministers for the period of up to the original tenure and disqualifying members defecting from splits caused by one-third of members moving out of a political party.{{sfn|G C.Malhotra|2005|p=Forword}}\n\n== Background ==\n\u201cGovernment is of the people by the people and for the people\", this is how [[Abraham Lincoln]] defined the Democracy. Elections in a democratic country are an important aspect where people cast their ballot and determine which political party shall govern the country or a state. In such scenarios, Political defections poses a major threat to the will of the people.{{sfn|G C.Malhotra|2005|p=5}} Political defections were as common in India, even common during pre-independence India. But ever since 1960, especially, the states added a new facet to the political instability in the country resulting from coalition politics in India. The term ''Aaya Ram Gaya Ram'', was popularized when in 1967, a legislator by name [[Gaya Lal]] changed his allegiance to three different parties in a single day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/anti-defection-law-explained|title=The Anti-Defection Law Explained|last=Relhan|first=Vibhor|date=December 2017|website=PRS Legislative Research|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1957 and 67, it is estimated that, because of a stronghold over power by [[Indian National Congress|Congress (I)]] party, it emerged as a sole beneficiary of the defections by losing 98 of its legislators and gaining 419. However, defections from non-Congress parties did not join any other political parties, instead they formed a separate political party intending to share power.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kashyap|first=Subhash|date=March 1970|title=The Politics of Defection: The Changing Contours of the Political Power Structure in State Politics in India|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2642574?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Asian Survey|volume=Vol.10 No.3|pages=197|via=JSTOR}}</ref> In 1967 elections, approximately 3,500 members were elected to various legislative assemblies and of union territories of them around 550 changed their parent parties by defections.

There was a definite trend in the political landscape of India during the 1970-80s. Whenever there was a Congress-led Government at the center, the regional governments fell like a pack of cards because of the defection of non-Congress elected representatives.

However, experts believed such defections should not be viewed in terms of numbers alone and should be seen in context as to how such defection damage the people's mandate.
