[[Timmins]], one of the largest cities in northern Ontario, is approximately {{convert|70|km|mi}} to the southwest. The following communities are also within the municipal boundaries: '''Monteith''', '''Nellie Lake''', and '''Porquis Junction'''.\n\nIroquois Falls' primary industry was a large mill producing newsprint and commercial printing papers.  In December 2014, the owner, [[Resolute Forest Products]], announced its permanent closure.<ref name=\"MG\">{{cite web | title = Resolute Forest to Shut Two Quebec Mills, One in Ontario | publisher = Montreal Gazette | date = December 5, 2014 | url = https://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/resolute-forest-to-shut-two-quebec-mills-one-in-ontario}}</ref><ref name=\"Labine\">{{cite web | last = Labine | first = Jeff | title = Mill Closing in Iroquois Falls | publisher = Timmins Press | date = December 5, 2014 | url = http://www.timminspress.com/2014/12/05/mill-closing-in-iroquois-falls}}</ref>  There are also three hydro-electric dams nearby.

Anson had been influenced by the [[garden city movement]] of urban planning, and was committed to building an elaborate town.  A Chicago architectural firm was hired to design the landscaping and houses, and work crews began clearing land in 1913.  The town's park and commercial developments were clearly separated from the paper mill, and the residential streets curved with a focus on the centre of the town.  A large church was built, the first English Catholic Parish in Northern Ontario, and today remains a historic landmark.  Anson's company town had a hospital, a school, and a company hotel.  Employee homes were designed with gambrel roofs to resemble New England farmhouses, and their design and location reflected the employee's rank at the mill.  Papermakers lived in double-adjoined homes, while senior managers lived on separate streets in single-family homes.<ref name=\"Abel\">{{cite book | last = Abel | first = Kerry M. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Changing Places: History, Community, and Identity in Northeastern Ontario | work = | publisher = McGill-Queen's University | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hukj0am0UlIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | format =}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the town was destroyed by fire in 1916, though Anson continued his beautification program during the 1920s as the community rebuilt.<ref>http://www.heritagefdn.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_10324_1.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916052723/http://www.heritagefdn.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_10324_1.html |date=16 September 2011 }} Ontario Heritage Trust Founding of Iroquois Falls</ref>\n\nThe town's avant-garde style earned it the nickname \"Anson's Folly\".<ref name=\"Abel\" />\n\nThe town was incorporated in 1915, and a board of trade was chartered in 1926.\n\nThe paper mill created a dramatic change to the area, and people migrated to the community for work.\n\nThe creation of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (now [[Ontario Northland Railway]]) greatly boosted the economy as there were few roads at the time.\n\nAs Iroquois Falls grew, two new communities within the town began to emerge.  An area known first as \"The Wye\" (because the rail tracks split at this point) grew to the south, and was at first a ramshackle collection of cabins and shacks.  It later became known as Ansonville, and was home to a number of business people and others who were shut out from the company town.  In contrast to Iroquois Falls, Ansonville had little town planning, and no water, sewer, or electrical service.  Insurance companies would not insure homes there because the risk of fire was too great, and the first residents were French-Canadians, Russians and Ukrainians.  Animosity was frequent between Ansonville and Iroquois Falls, and many residents of Iroquois Falls condemned Ansonville \"as a dark den of foreigners engaged in regular street brawls, illegal alcohol consumption, and other unsavoury activities\"<ref name=\"Abel\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nIn 1921, Ansonville began to levy taxes, which led a group of residents to establish a third community named Victoria in the north-west section of the town.  The name was later changed to Montrock.<ref name=\"Abel\" />\n\nIn 1979, the three communities were amalgamated into one town named Iroquois Falls.\n\nThe paper mill, then called Abitibi-Price, merged with Stone-Consolidated, and then with Donohue Forest Products, and finally with Bowater to create Abitibi-Bowater.  On 17 April 2009, Abitibi-Bowater sought bankruptcy protection, emerging from it as Resolute Forest Products.\n\nA tragic event occurred in 1984 at the coffee shop at Joe's Texaco in nearby Porquois Junction.  Ontario Provincial Police constable Vern Miller was drinking coffee with his partner constable Norm Tiegen, when 23-year-old Gregg Prevost of Iroquois Falls entered and shot Miller with a shotgun, killing him instantly.  The community was shocked and outraged, and Prevost was sentenced to life in prison.  The town of [[Black River-Matheson|Matheson]] renamed their local arena the Vern Miller Memorial Arena in his honour.<ref>{{cite web | last = Grech | first = Ron | title = Cop killer seeks return home  | publisher = The Daily Press (Timmins) | date = 10 Jan 2013 | url = http://www.timminspress.com/2013/01/10/cop-killer-seeks-return-home}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Climate===\nIroquois Falls falls within the northern periphery of the [[Humid continental climate]] (Dfb) despite extreme January and February record lows that exceed that of many subarctic regions. In January 1935, the town set the record low temperature for Ontario of {{convert|\u221258.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, the town also happens to hold the unofficial February record low of {{convert|-55.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}.<ref name= \"climate\"/> set in February 1899 (before the town was officially incorporated but weather was taken) and tied in February 1934 but it wasn't recorded at the location used for official temperature readings.

Anson had been influenced by the [[garden city movement]] of urban planning, and was committed to building an elaborate town.  A Chicago architectural firm was hired to design the landscaping and houses, and work crews began clearing land in 1913.  The town's park and commercial developments were clearly separated from the paper mill, and the residential streets curved with a focus on the centre of the town.  A large church was built, the first English Catholic Parish in Northern Ontario, and today remains a historic landmark.  Anson's company town had a hospital, a school, and a company hotel.  Employee homes were designed with gambrel roofs to resemble New England farmhouses, and their design and location reflected the employee's rank at the mill.  Papermakers lived in double-adjoined homes, while senior managers lived on separate streets in single-family homes.<ref name=\"Abel\">{{cite book | last = Abel | first = Kerry M. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Changing Places: History, Community, and Identity in Northeastern Ontario | work = | publisher = McGill-Queen's University | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hukj0am0UlIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | format =}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the town was destroyed by fire in 1916, though Anson continued his beautification program during the 1920s as the community rebuilt.<ref>http://www.heritagefdn.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_10324_1.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916052723/http://www.heritagefdn.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_10324_1.html |date=16 September 2011 }} Ontario Heritage Trust Founding of Iroquois Falls</ref>\n\nThe town's avant-garde style earned it the nickname \"Anson's Folly\".<ref name=\"Abel\" />\n\nThe town was incorporated in 1915, and a board of trade was chartered in 1926.\n\nThe paper mill created a dramatic change to the area, and people migrated to the community for work.\n\nThe creation of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (now [[Ontario Northland Railway]]) greatly boosted the economy as there were few roads at the time.\n\nAs Iroquois Falls grew, two new communities within the town began to emerge.  An area known first as \"The Wye\" (because the rail tracks split at this point) grew to the south, and was at first a ramshackle collection of cabins and shacks.  It later became known as Ansonville, and was home to a number of business people and others who were shut out from the company town.  In contrast to Iroquois Falls, Ansonville had little town planning, and no water, sewer, or electrical service.  Insurance companies would not insure homes there because the risk of fire was too great, and the first residents were French-Canadians, Russians and Ukrainians.  Animosity was frequent between Ansonville and Iroquois Falls, and many residents of Iroquois Falls condemned Ansonville \"as a dark den of foreigners engaged in regular street brawls, illegal alcohol consumption, and other unsavoury activities\"<ref name=\"Abel\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nIn 1921, Ansonville began to levy taxes, which led a group of residents to establish a third community named Victoria in the north-west section of the town.  The name was later changed to Montrock.<ref name=\"Abel\" />\n\nIn 1979, the three communities were amalgamated into one town named Iroquois Falls.\n\nThe paper mill, then called Abitibi-Price, merged with Stone-Consolidated, and then with Donohue Forest Products, and finally with Bowater to create Abitibi-Bowater.  On 17 April 2009, Abitibi-Bowater sought bankruptcy protection, emerging from it as Resolute Forest Products.\n\nA tragic event occurred in 1984 at the coffee shop at Joe's Texaco in nearby Porquois Junction.  Ontario Provincial Police constable Vern Miller was drinking coffee with his partner constable Norm Tiegen, when 23-year-old Gregg Prevost of Iroquois Falls entered and shot Miller with a shotgun, killing him instantly.  The community was shocked and outraged, and Prevost was sentenced to life in prison.  The town of [[Black River-Matheson|Matheson]] renamed their local arena the Vern Miller Memorial Arena in his honour.<ref>{{cite web | last = Grech | first = Ron | title = Cop killer seeks return home  | publisher = The Daily Press (Timmins) | date = 10 Jan 2013 | url = http://www.timminspress.com/2013/01/10/cop-killer-seeks-return-home}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Climate===\nIroquois Falls falls within the northern periphery of the [[Humid continental climate]] (Dfb) despite extreme January and February record lows that exceed that of many subarctic regions.

Established in {{Years or months ago|1897}} in 1897, the hospital is named after Dr. Charles L. Gritman. The&nbsp;medical center is the largest private employer in [[Latah County, Idaho|Latah County]].\n\n== History ==\nDr. Gritman began providing care to the Moscow community in 1893, visiting patients throughout Latah County by horse and buggy. In 1897, Dr. Gritman purchased the former McGregor Hotel, at the southeast corner of Seventh and Main Streets, and opened the doors of the original Gritman hospital, setting the bar for exemplary health care services throughout the [[Palouse]] region. The original hospital housed 30 beds for surgical patients and expecting mothers. Dr. Gritman performed the first [[appendectomy]] in the area at the hospital.\n\nAfter Dr. Gritman passed in 1933, his wife Bertie opened the hospital to Moscow's physicians. By this time, the hospital began to need renovations to meet 20th century medical standards. Local businesses and professionals began to develop a plan to construct a new hospital. This group adapted into a non-profit organization that later became the Gritman Medical Center General Membership, a body still active today from which the hospital selects its board of directors. Dr. Gritman's wife, Bertie, gave the original hospital and the property to the community under the condition the hospital always bear Dr. Gritman's name.\n\n=== 1940\u20131959 ===\nOn December 21, 1940, Gritman Memorial Hospital opened its doors for operation. The four-story south wing housed 25 patient beds. A second-floor ramp connected the new building to the old hospital structure, which was being used as storage and emergency overflow.\n\nThe original building was cleared in 1942 to allow for the building of the north wing to be connected to the previously constructed south wing. The corner-stone entrance connecting the two wings serves as a historic landmark in the Moscow community.\n\nThe hospital, free from debt by 1957, once again sought expansion to provide a growing community with more advanced health care.\n\n=== 1960\u20131985 ===\nThe center wing of the hospital was dedicated in May 1962, allowing the hospital more space to better serve the Palouse. The east wing of the hospital, opened in 1974, included more beds, laboratories, a radiology department, and a new lobby and gift shop.\n\nThe hospital began to seek management groups in 1982, creating a partnership with Hospital Cooperation of American. The group later became Quorum, with whom the hospital is still a partner. In 1987, a new diagnostic imaging wing opened, creating the space for the hospital to add new medical technology and provide more services to the Moscow community.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1991, the official name of the hospital was changed from Gritman Memorial Hospital to Gritman Medical Center to reflect the addition of wellness services and clinics. The hospital still bears the name Gritman Medical Center today.\n\nContinuing to seek to deliver the best in health care to the Moscow community, Gritman announced a $4.6 million renovation in&nbsp;1994.<ref name=emttour>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aPQ0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=pjsKAAAAIBAJ&pg=6409%2C2633851 |work=Moscow-Pullman Daily News |last=Rishling |first=Vicki |title=EMTs tour Gritman's new trauma center |date=May 23, 1994 |page=8A}}</ref><ref name=clondr>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4cwqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=99AFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4141%2C880551 |work=Moscow-Pullman Daily News |last=Rishling |first=Vicki |title=Gritman Medical Center closes one door, opens another |date=July 9, 1994 |page=8A}}</ref><ref name=nwincos>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5sEjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ENEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2359%2C945977 |work=Moscow-Pullman Daily News |last1=Frisch |first1=R.C. |last2=White |first2=Vera |title=Gritman opens new wing, increases outpatient services |date=August 10, 1994 |page=1A}}</ref><ref name=nwosupl>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=58EjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ENEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5334%2C1147437|work=Moscow-Pullman Daily News |agency=(new wing opening supplement) |title=Gritman's community-oriented future found in its past |date=August 11, 1994 |page=4C}}</ref> The&nbsp;project added {{convert|50,000|ft2|-1}} of space to the hospital in 1994, giving room for more clinical, surgical, and administrative services.\n\n=== 2004 ===\nOn July 1, 2004, the hospital completed a {{convert|52,000|ft2|-1|adj=on}} renovation, built over Eighth Street between Main and Washington.
