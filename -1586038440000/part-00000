Common released his first album, ''[[Can I Borrow a Dollar?]]'' (1992), and follow suit with his second album, ''[[Resurrection (Common album)|Resurrection]]'', which met with critical acclaim, calling the album as one of the classic of the 90s. Common released his third album, ''[[One Day It'll All Make Sense]]'', which was a little commercial success, follow suit with his fourth album, ''[[Like Water for Chocolate (album)|Like Water for Chocolate]]'', which was met with critical acclaim from music critics, calling it the best rap album of the year. The album was also a commercial success certifying it gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

However, it failed to meet the commercial success with ''Like Water for Chocolate'', which only peaked at number 47 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nIn 2005, he was helped by [[Kanye West]] to release his 6th album ''[[Be (Common album)|Be]]''. Kanye produced the whole album and was featured on it a few times. The album helped Common to get back into the spotlight and sold 185,000 copies in its first week debuting at number 2 on the charts and also it was Common's first album to have commercial success outside the US, peaking in several territories. The album was met with universal acclaim and it was described to be Common's best album. The album was certified gold by the RIAA. His next album ''[[Finding Forever]]'' peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 being his first chart-topper. His next album ''[[Universal Mind Control]]'' sold 81,663 in its first week debuting only at number 12. The album was promoted by the successful single \"[[Universal Mind Control (song)|Universal Mind Control]]\" which peaked at number 62 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album was met with mixed reviews. His next album ''[[The Dreamer/The Believer]]'' was met with positive reviews from music critics and debuted at number 18 on the charts, selling 70,000 copies in its first week and was promoted by five singles. In 2014 Common released his 10th album ''[[Nobody's Smiling]]'' which peaked at number 6 on the charts and had features from [[Big Sean]] and [[Vince Staples]] and others. In 2015 he collaborated with [[John Legend]] on the single \"[[Glory (Common and John Legend song)|Glory]]\" which peaked at number 49 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

The album was met with universal acclaim and it was described to be Common's best album. The album was certified gold by the RIAA. His next album ''[[Finding Forever]]'' peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 being his first chart-topper. His next album ''[[Universal Mind Control]]'' sold 81,663 in its first week debuting only at number 12. The album was promoted by the successful single \"[[Universal Mind Control (song)|Universal Mind Control]]\" which peaked at number 62 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

In 2014 Common released his 10th album ''[[Nobody's Smiling]]'' which peaked at number 6 on the charts and had features from [[Big Sean]] and [[Vince Staples]] and others.

Chromium metal was first shown to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise|French Academy]] by [[Louis Vauquelin|Vauquelin]] in 1798. In the early 1800s, Stodart, Faraday, and Mallet observed the resistance of chromium-iron alloys (\"chromium steels\") to [[oxidizing agents]]. Bunsen discovered chromium's resistance to strong acids, as well as the discovery of other metals. The science metallography was developed by Henry Sorby in 1863.<ref name = CobbHistory2010/>{{rp|258\u2013261}} The corrosion resistance of iron-chromium alloys may have been first recognized in 1821 by French metallurgist [[Pierre Berthier]], who noted their resistance against attack by some acids and suggested their use in [[cutlery]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n\nThese events led to the first production of steel that contained a small amount of chromium, by J.

Between 1904 and 1911 several researchers, particularly [[Leon Guillet]] of France, prepared alloys that would today be considered stainless steel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bssa.org.uk/about_stainless_steel.php?id=31 |title=The Discovery of Stainless Steel |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft]] built the 366-ton sailing yacht ''[[Germania (yacht)|Germania]]'' featuring a chrome-nickel steel hull in Germany. In 1911, [[Philip Monnartz]] reported on the relationship between chromium content and corrosion resistance.

Technical Development Dept., Nippon Metal Industry, Co., Ltd.</ref>\n* 300 series are chromium-nickel alloys, which achieve their austenitic microstructure almost exclusively by nickel alloying; some very highly alloyed grades include some nitrogen to reduce nickel requirements. 300 series is the largest group and the most widely used. \n** Type 304: The best known grade is Type 304, also known as 18/8 and 18/10 for its composition of 18% chromium and 8%/10% nickel, respectively. \n** Type 316: The second most common austenitic stainless steel is Type 316. The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

They offer a higher toughness and higher corrosion resistance. Grade EN 1.4303 (Casting grade CA6NM) with 13% Cr and 4% Ni is used for most [[Pelton wheel|Pelton]], [[Kaplan turbine|Kaplan]] and [[Francis turbine]]s in [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power plant]]<nowiki/>s <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/publications/brochures_and_posters|title=Stainless teel in Micro Hydro turbines|publisher=International Stainless Steel Forum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316010101/http://worldstainless.org/publications/brochures_and_posters|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018}}</ref> because it has good casting properties, a good weldability and a good resistance to [[cavitation]] erosion.\n# Precipitation hardening grades: Grade EN 1.4542 (a.k.a. 17/4PH), the best known grade, combines martensitic hardening and precipitation hardening.

The austenite is a face centered cubic phase.\n# [[Quenching]]. The austenite is transformed into martensite, a hard [[body-centered tetragonal]] crystal structure. The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.  Increasing the tempering temperature decreases the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate tensile strength]] but increases the elongation and the impact resistance.\n\n====Nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels====\nReplacing some of the carbon in martensitic stainless steels by nitrogen is a fairly recent development. The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure. Up to 0.4% nitrogen contents have been achieved leading to higher hardness/strength and higher corrosion resistance.  As the PESR is expensive, lower but significant nitrogen contents have been achieved using the standard [[argon oxygen decarburization]] (AOD) process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leda H.|date=1995|title=Nitrogen in Martensitic stainless steels|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=55|issue=1\u20132|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1016/0924-0136(95)01984-M}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamano S., Shimizu T., Noda Toshiharu|date=2007|editor-last=|title=Properties of Low Carbon High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=Materials Science Forum|volume=539\u2013543|pages=4975\u20134980|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.539-543.4975|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57f9373fef3b9e4a37121f8b4c8c93617ed0745b}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz M.B., Benedetto Neto, Garbogini A., Tschiptschin A.P.|date=1996|title=Nitrogen-Bearing Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=ISIJ International|volume=36|issue=7|pages=840\u2013845|doi=10.2355/isijinternational.36.840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasokha N., Berns H.|date=2011|title=Study on nitrogen in martensitic stainless steels|journal=Journal of Heat Treatments and Materials|volume=66|issue=3|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.3139/105.110099}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorodin D., Manes L., Monicault J-M|date=2002|title=Characterization of the XD15N High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel for Aerospace Bearing|url=|journal=4th International Conference on Launcher Technology \"Space Launcher Liquid Propulsion, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium|volume=|pages=|via=Centre National Etudes Spatiales}}</ref>\n\nThey are magnetic. They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching. At this point, the structure remains austenitic. Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts. Yield stress levels above 1400{{nbsp}}MPa are then reached.\n\n- Austenitic A286<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rolledalloys.com/alloys/stainless-steels/a-286/en/|title=A-286 - Rolled Alloys, Inc.|website=www.rolledalloys.com}} </ref>(ASTM 660 EN 1.4980)  has the following typical analysis Cr 15%, Ni 25%, Ti 2.1%, Mo 1.2%, V 1.3%, and B 0.005%.\n\nThe structure remains austenitic at all temperatures.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves solution treatment and quenching, followed by aging at 715&nbsp;\u00b0C.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid. Type 304 SS can be used with formic acid, though it tends to discolor the solution. [[Acetic acid]] is probably the most commercially important of the organic acids, and Type 316 SS is commonly used for storing and handling acetic acid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/SelectionandUseofStainlessSteelandNickel_BearingAlloysinOrganicAcids_10063_.ashx |title=Selection and Use of Stainless Steel and Nickel-Bearing Alloys in Organic Acids |last=C.

Type 316L is required for processing of [[urea]].<ref name=Davis1994/>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Localized corrosion===\n\nLocalized corrosion can occur in a number of ways, e.g. [[pitting corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]]. Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.) and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal. When the two surfaces are of the same material, these exposed surfaces can easily fuse together. Separation of the two surfaces can result in surface tearing and even complete seizure of metal components or fasteners.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/ReviewofWearandGallingCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9006_.ashx |title=Review of the Wear and Galling Characteristics of Stainless Steels |last=Committee of Stainless Steel Producers.

Additionally, threaded joints may be [[Lubrication|lubricated]] to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling. Also, [[Nitronic]] 60, made by selective alloying with manganese, silicon, and nitrogen, has demonstrated a reduced tendency to gall.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Standard finishes==\n{{Main|Brushed metal}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

The molten metal is then poured into a ladle and transferred into the AOD\n* Argon oxygen secarburization (AOD) allows the removal of carbon in the molten steel and other composition adjustments to achieve the desired chemical composition of the steel\n* Continuous casting (CC) in which the molten metal is solidified into slabs (typical section is 20&nbsp;cm thick and 2{{nbsp}}m wide) for flat products or blooms (sections vary widely but {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 25 cm}} is about the average).\n* Hot rolling (HR): The slabs and blooms are reheated in a furnace and then hot rolled. Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

For example, duplex stainless steels are being used in [[Kraft process|digesters]] to convert wood chips into wood pulp. 6% Mo superaustenitics are used in the [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleach plant]] and Type 316 is used extensively in the [[paper machine]].\n\n===Chemical processing and petrochemical===\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in these industries for their corrosion resistance to both aqueous, gaseous and high temperature environments, their mechanical properties at all temperatures from cryogenic to the very high, and occasionally for other special physical properties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelsforChemicalProcessEquipment_14038_.ashx|title=Stainless Steels for Chemical Process Equipment|last=G.

Stainless steels do not affect the taste of the product, they are easily cleaned and sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination of the food, and they are durable.\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in cookware, commercial food processing, commercial kitchens, brewing beer, wine making, and meat processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/FoodAndBeverage/WhyStainless.aspx|title=Food & Beverage Industry|last=Nickel Institute|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nAcidic foods with high salt additions, such as tomato sauce, and highly salted condiments, such as soya sauce may require higher alloyed stainless steels such as 6% Mo superaustenitics to prevent pitting corrosion by chloride.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n;  Automobiles\n{{See also|Braided stainless steel brake lines}}\nThe [[Allegheny Technologies|Allegheny Ludlum Corporation]] worked with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] on various [[concept car]]s with stainless steel bodies from the 1930s through the 1970s to demonstrate the material's potential. The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as needles,<ref>[[Stanley Malamed|Malamed, Stanley]] (2004). ''Handbook of Local Anesthesia'', 5th Edition.

Valadium is usually silver-toned, but can be electro-plated to give it a gold tone. The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

As this is an average, countries that have low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in their electricity production (such as France with nuclear energy) will have lower figures.  Ferritics without Ni will have a lower CO<sub>2</sub> footprint than austenitics with 8% Ni or more.\n\nCarbon footprint must not be the only factor for deciding the choice of materials:\n* over any product life,  maintenance, repairs (when possible) or early end of life (planned obsolescence) can increase the overall footprint way beyond the difference between materials only.

According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

Technical Development Dept., Nippon Metal Industry, Co., Ltd.</ref>\n* 300 series are chromium-nickel alloys, which achieve their austenitic microstructure almost exclusively by nickel alloying; some very highly alloyed grades include some nitrogen to reduce nickel requirements. 300 series is the largest group and the most widely used. \n** Type 304: The best known grade is Type 304, also known as 18/8 and 18/10 for its composition of 18% chromium and 8%/10% nickel, respectively. \n** Type 316: The second most common austenitic stainless steel is Type 316. The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

They offer a higher toughness and higher corrosion resistance. Grade EN 1.4303 (Casting grade CA6NM) with 13% Cr and 4% Ni is used for most [[Pelton wheel|Pelton]], [[Kaplan turbine|Kaplan]] and [[Francis turbine]]s in [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power plant]]<nowiki/>s <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/publications/brochures_and_posters|title=Stainless teel in Micro Hydro turbines|publisher=International Stainless Steel Forum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316010101/http://worldstainless.org/publications/brochures_and_posters|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018}}</ref> because it has good casting properties, a good weldability and a good resistance to [[cavitation]] erosion.\n# Precipitation hardening grades: Grade EN 1.4542 (a.k.a. 17/4PH), the best known grade, combines martensitic hardening and precipitation hardening.  It achieves high strength and good toughness and is used in aerospace among other applications.\n# Creep-resisting grades: Small additions of niobium, vanadium, boron, and cobalt increase the strength and creep resistance up to about 650&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n==== Heat treatment of martensitic stainless steels ====\nMartensitic stainless steels form a family of stainless steels that can be heat treated to provide an adequate level of mechanical properties.\n\nThe heat treatment typically involves three steps:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.asminternational.org/web/hts/home/-/journal_content/56/10192/ZASMHBA0005985/BOOK-ARTICLE|title=ASM Handbook Vol 4D Heat treating of irons and steels|last=Dossett J and GE Totten Editors|publisher=ASM International|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=382\u2013396}}</ref>\n# Austenitizing, in which the steel is heated to a temperature in the range 980\u20131050&nbsp;\u00b0C depending on the grades. The austenite is a face centered cubic phase.\n# [[Quenching]]. The austenite is transformed into martensite, a hard [[body-centered tetragonal]] crystal structure. The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.  Increasing the tempering temperature decreases the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate tensile strength]] but increases the elongation and the impact resistance.\n\n====Nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels====\nReplacing some of the carbon in martensitic stainless steels by nitrogen is a fairly recent development. The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure. Up to 0.4% nitrogen contents have been achieved leading to higher hardness/strength and higher corrosion resistance.  As the PESR is expensive, lower but significant nitrogen contents have been achieved using the standard [[argon oxygen decarburization]] (AOD) process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leda H.|date=1995|title=Nitrogen in Martensitic stainless steels|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=55|issue=1\u20132|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1016/0924-0136(95)01984-M}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamano S., Shimizu T., Noda Toshiharu|date=2007|editor-last=|title=Properties of Low Carbon High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=Materials Science Forum|volume=539\u2013543|pages=4975\u20134980|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.539-543.4975|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57f9373fef3b9e4a37121f8b4c8c93617ed0745b}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz M.B., Benedetto Neto, Garbogini A., Tschiptschin A.P.|date=1996|title=Nitrogen-Bearing Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=ISIJ International|volume=36|issue=7|pages=840\u2013845|doi=10.2355/isijinternational.36.840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasokha N., Berns H.|date=2011|title=Study on nitrogen in martensitic stainless steels|journal=Journal of Heat Treatments and Materials|volume=66|issue=3|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.3139/105.110099}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorodin D., Manes L., Monicault J-M|date=2002|title=Characterization of the XD15N High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel for Aerospace Bearing|url=|journal=4th International Conference on Launcher Technology \"Space Launcher Liquid Propulsion, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium|volume=|pages=|via=Centre National Etudes Spatiales}}</ref>\n\nThey are magnetic. They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching. At this point, the structure remains austenitic. Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts. Yield stress levels above 1400{{nbsp}}MPa are then reached.\n\n- Austenitic A286<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rolledalloys.com/alloys/stainless-steels/a-286/en/|title=A-286 - Rolled Alloys, Inc.|website=www.rolledalloys.com}} </ref>(ASTM 660 EN 1.4980)  has the following typical analysis Cr 15%, Ni 25%, Ti 2.1%, Mo 1.2%, V 1.3%, and B 0.005%.\n\nThe structure remains austenitic at all temperatures.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves solution treatment and quenching, followed by aging at 715&nbsp;\u00b0C.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured. At room temperature, [[SAE 304 stainless steel|Type 304]] stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while [[SAE 316L stainless steel|Type 316]] SS is resistant to 3% acid up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and 20% acid at room temperature. Thus Type 304 SS is rarely used in contact with sulfuric acid. [[SAE 904L stainless steel|Type 904L]] SS and [[Alloy 20]] are resistant to sulfuric acid at even higher concentrations above room temperature.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/TheCorrosionResistanceofNickel_ContainingAlloysinSulphuricAcidandRelatedCompounds_1318_.ashx |title=The Corrosion Resistance of Nickel-Containing Alloys in Sulphuric Acid and Related Compounds |last=International Nickel Company |date=1983 |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |author = Schillmoller, C.M. |date=1990 |title=Selection and Performance of Stainless Steel and other Nickel-Bearing Alloys in Sulphuric Acid | series = NiDI Technical Series No. 10 057 | location = Toronto, CA | publisher =Nickel Development Institute | url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/SelectionandPerformatceofStainlessSteelandotherNickel_BearingAlloysinSulphuricAcid_10057_.ashx |access-date= 9 March 2020}}</ref> Concentrated sulfuric acid possesses oxidizing characteristics like nitric acid, and thus silicon-bearing stainless steels also find application.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Hydrochloric acid]] damages any kind of stainless steel and should be avoided.<ref name=Davis1994/>{{rp|118}}<ref>{{Cite web | author = Davies, Michael  |date=2018 | title=Alloy Selection for Service in Chlorine, Hydrogen Chloride and Hydrochloric Acid: A Guide to the Use of Nickel-Containing Alloys | edition = 2nd | editor = Moe, Geir | location = Toronto, CA | publisher=Nickel Development Institute | url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/AlloystoResistChlorine_HydrogenChlorideandHydrochloricAcid_10020_.ashx |access-date=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAll types of stainless steel resist attack from [[phosphoric acid]] and [[nitric acid]] at room temperature.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid. Type 304 SS can be used with formic acid, though it tends to discolor the solution. [[Acetic acid]] is probably the most commercially important of the organic acids, and Type 316 SS is commonly used for storing and handling acetic acid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/SelectionandUseofStainlessSteelandNickel_BearingAlloysinOrganicAcids_10063_.ashx |title=Selection and Use of Stainless Steel and Nickel-Bearing Alloys in Organic Acids |last=C.

The same grades of stainless exposed to stronger bases such as [[sodium hydroxide]] at high concentrations and high temperatures will likely experience some etching and cracking.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/AlloySelectionforCausticSodaService_10019_.ashx |title=Alloy Selection for Caustic Soda Service |last=C.

Fats and [[fatty acid]]s only affect Type 304 SS at temperatures above {{convert|150|C|F}} and Type 316 SS above {{convert|260|C|F}}, while Type 317 SS is unaffected at all temperatures. Type 316L is required for processing of [[urea]].<ref name=Davis1994/>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Localized corrosion===\n\nLocalized corrosion can occur in a number of ways, e.g. [[pitting corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]]. Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.) and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal. When the two surfaces are of the same material, these exposed surfaces can easily fuse together. Separation of the two surfaces can result in surface tearing and even complete seizure of metal components or fasteners.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/ReviewofWearandGallingCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9006_.ashx |title=Review of the Wear and Galling Characteristics of Stainless Steels |last=Committee of Stainless Steel Producers.

Additionally, threaded joints may be [[Lubrication|lubricated]] to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling. Also, [[Nitronic]] 60, made by selective alloying with manganese, silicon, and nitrogen, has demonstrated a reduced tendency to gall.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Standard finishes==\n{{Main|Brushed metal}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

Stainless steels do not affect the taste of the product, they are easily cleaned and sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination of the food, and they are durable.\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in cookware, commercial food processing, commercial kitchens, brewing beer, wine making, and meat processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/FoodAndBeverage/WhyStainless.aspx|title=Food & Beverage Industry|last=Nickel Institute|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nAcidic foods with high salt additions, such as tomato sauce, and highly salted condiments, such as soya sauce may require higher alloyed stainless steels such as 6% Mo superaustenitics to prevent pitting corrosion by chloride.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n;  Automobiles\n{{See also|Braided stainless steel brake lines}}\nThe [[Allegheny Technologies|Allegheny Ludlum Corporation]] worked with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] on various [[concept car]]s with stainless steel bodies from the 1930s through the 1970s to demonstrate the material's potential. The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry.

The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

However, there may be other costs that a community wants to consider as well:{{citation needed|date = March 2020}}\n* utilities, such as power plants, water supply & wastewater treatment, hospitals, \u2026 cannot be shut down. Any maintenance will require extra costs associated with continuing service; and \n* Indirect societal costs (with possible political fallout)  may be incurred in some situations such as closing or reducing traffic on bridges, creating queues, delays,  loss of working hours to the people, and increased pollution by idling vehicles.\n\n==Sustainability\u2013recycling and reuse==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

As this is an average, countries that have low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in their electricity production (such as France with nuclear energy) will have lower figures.  Ferritics without Ni will have a lower CO<sub>2</sub> footprint than austenitics with 8% Ni or more.\n\nCarbon footprint must not be the only factor for deciding the choice of materials:\n* over any product life,  maintenance, repairs (when possible) or early end of life (planned obsolescence) can increase the overall footprint way beyond the difference between materials only.  In addition loss of service (typically for bridges) may induce large hidden costs (queues, wasted fuel, loss of man-hours;)\n* how much material is used to provide a given service varies with the performance, particularly the strength level, which allows lighter structures and components.\n\nStainless steel is 100% [[recyclable]].<ref>{{citation |author= Johnson, J., Reck, B.K., Wang, T., Graede, T.E. |title=The energy benefit of stainless steel recycling |year=2008 |journal=Energy Policy\n|volume=36 |pages=181\u2013192 |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2007.08.028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingStainlessSteel.aspx|title=Recycling Stainless Steel|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingofNickelcontainingalloys.aspx|title=Recycling of Nickel-containing Alloys|website=Nickel Instiitute}}</ref> An average stainless steel object is composed of about 60% recycled material of which approximately 40% originates from end-of-life products and about 60% comes from manufacturing processes.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110127075255/http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 27 January 2011\n |title      = The Recycling of Stainless Steel (\"Recycled Content\" and \"Input Composition\" slides)\n |accessdate = 19 November 2006\n |year       = 2006\n |format     = Flash\n |publisher  = International Stainless Steel Forum\n}}</ref> What prevents a higher recycling content is the availability of stainless steel scrap, in spite of a very high recycling rate. According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

His father, Ladislav Sucho\u0148, was an [[organist]] and teacher. His mother, Seraf\u00edna Sucho\u0148ov\u00e1, was a piano teacher, and it was from her that he received his first piano tuition. The house was always filled with music and, as a small child, he would listen from under the piano when his father rehearsed at home with other musicians. In 1920, at the age of twelve, he started taking piano lessons at the [[Bratislava]] School of Music with the distinguished musician [[Frico Kafenda]]. Later, from 1927 to 1931, he continued his studies with the same teacher at the newly established Academy of Music in Bratislava. His early works include several piano compositions and a choral work ''Ve\u013eky P\u00f4st (The Great Fast)''. He graduated from his composition classes with the ''Sonata in [[A-flat major|A-flat]] for Violin and Piano'' and a ''[[String Quartet]]'' (op. 2, 1931, revised 1939). His two-year studies at the [[Prague Conservatory|Prague Conservatoire]] under [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nov\u00e1k]] set the seal on the thorough training he had received from Kafenda.\n\nCompositions from this period include a [[Piano Quartet]] (1933), and the [[song cycle]] ''Nox et solitudo'' for [[mezzo-soprano]] and small orchestra or piano (1932) based on a poem by [[Ivan Krasko]], ''Little [[Suite (music)|Suite]] with [[Passacaglia]]'' for piano (1930, orchestrated in 1967), ''[[Serenade]] for [[Brass Quintet]]'' and the ''[[Burlesque]] for Violin and Orchestra''. All these works show an already distinguished and mature composer. During this time Eugen Sucho\u0148 taught music theory at the Academy of Music and Drama in Bratislava (1933). His works from this period are in a late [[Romanticism|Romantic]] idiom with elements of folk [[mode (music)|modality]] combined with [[chromaticism]]. In particular the popular male choral cycle ''O hor\u00e1ch'' (\"Of mountains\") was a seminal work which established a Slovak national style. This was followed by his monumental cantata, ''The [[Psalm]] of the Sub-[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] Land'' (1938). Many folksong arrangements date from this period, which culminated in his opera ''[[Kr\u00fat\u0148ava]]'' (''The Whirlpool'', 1949).<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/eugen-suchon-mn0002341311/biography AllMusic]</ref>\n\n==Middle years==\nThe success of Kr\u00fat\u0148ava established modern Slovak opera, and drew international attention. From 1948 to 1960 Sucho\u0148 was professor and head of the Department of Music Education at the Teacher Training College in Bratislava. Works from this period include the ''Fantasies'' for Violin and Orchestra, ''Metamorphoses'' for piano, and the ''Symphonic Suite'' for grand orchestra. Sucho\u0148 became heavily involved in the practical and theoretical aspects of music education. Of particular significance was his second opera ''[[Sv\u00e4topluk (opera)|Kra\u013e Sv\u00e4topluk]]'' (\"King Sv\u00e4topluk\"), completed in 1959. This historic opera represents the monumental dramatic fresco from the period of the [[Great Moravian Empire]]. It is a large-scale work with noble aspirations, displaying [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] motifs and culminating in the victory of good over evil. The work was premiered in Bratislava in 1960, and performed the same year in [[Prague]] and [[Ko\u0161ice]].\n\n==Later years==\nFrom 1959 to 1974 he was professor of music theory at [[Comenius University in Bratislava|Bratislava University]]. His style changed as he incorporated [[serialism]] into his compositions. Harmonies emphasizing 2nds, 4ths and 7ths led to [[polymodality]]. His later output consists predominantly of chamber and orchestral works, e. g., the song cycle ''Ad astra ''(1961), based on poems by [[\u0160tefan \u017d\u00e1ry]], the mixed choir cycle ''O \u010dloveku'' (\"about a human\"), the ''Po\u00e8me macabre'' for violin and piano, ''Contemplations'' for narrator and piano, ''Six Compositions for Strings'', the ''Rhapsodic Suite for piano and orchestra'' and the ''Symfonick\u00e1 fantasia na BACH'' (1971). His piano cycle ''Kaleidoscope'' also exists in a version for piano, string orchestra and percussion. His last works include a ''Concertino for Clarinet and Orchestra'', ''Elegy'', ''Toccata'', and the [[song cycle]]s ''Glimpse into the Unknown'' and ''Three Songs for Bass''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVz3GpykjBY&index=4&list=WL Great Composers: Eugen Sucho\u0148-Classical Nerd on YouTube]</ref>\n\nSucho\u0148 died in Bratislava in 1993.\n\n==Works==\n\n===Dramatic works===\n*''Music to Stodola's drama King Sv\u00e4topluk'' (1935\u201336)\n*''Music to Gerzo's play Barbara of Celje'' (1937)\n\n===Operas===\n*''[[Kr\u00fat\u0148ava]]'' (''The Whirlpool''; 1941\u201349), libretto by Sucho\u0148 and [[\u0160tefan Hoza]]\n*''[[Sv\u00e4topluk (opera)|Sv\u00e4topluk]]'' (1952\u201359), libretto by Sucho\u0148, Jela Kr\u010dm\u00e9ry-Vrte\u013eov\u00e1 and [[Ivan Stodola]]\n\n===Symphonic works===\n*''The little Suite with Passacaglia'' (1967)\n*''Overture to Stodola's drama King Svatopluk'' (1934)\n*''Balladic Suite'', [[opus number|op.]] 9 (1934\u201336, published 1940)<ref name=\"hmb40p43\">''Hofmeisters Monatsberichte'', 1940, p.43.</ref>\n*''Psalm of the Carpathian land'' (1937\u201338)\n*''The fight will be finished tomorrow'' (1950)\n*''Metamorphoses'' (1951\u201353)\n*''Symfonietta Rustica'' (1954\u201355)\n*''The Breakthrough'' (1977)\n*''Three Songs for Bass'' (1984\u201385)\n*''The Night of the Witches'' (1927)\n\n===Orchestral works with soloist===\n*''Burlesque'' (1933)\n*''Fantasia'' (1948)\n*''Rhapsodic Suite'' (1964)\n*''Symphonic Fantasia on B-A-C-H'' (1971)\n*''Concertino'' (1977)\n\n===Chamber works===\n*''Sonata in A{{music|flat}} Major'' (1929\u201330)\n*''String Quartet'' (1930\u201331, reworked 1939)\n*''Little Suite with Passacaglia'' (1931\u201332)\n*''Serenade'' (1932\u201333)\n*''Piano Quartet'' (1932\u201333)\n*''Balladic Suite'' (1935)\n*''Academic Fanfare of Comenius University'' (1937)\n*''Sonatina'' (1937)\n*''Wedding Dance from opera The Whirlpool'' (1971)\n*''Metamorphoses'' (1951\u201353)\n*''Poeme Macabre'' (1963)\n*''Six Pieces for Strings'' (1955\u201364)\n*''Kaleidoscope'' (1967)\n*''Toccata'' (1973)\n\n===Vocal works===\n*''Nox et Solitudo'' (1932)\n*''Ad astra'' (1961)\n*''Contemplations'' (1964)\n*''Glimpse into the unknown'' (1977)\n\n===Choral works===\n*''How Beautiful You Are'' (1932\u201333)\n*''Psalm of the Carpathian Lands'', op. 12 (published in 1940)<ref name=\"hmb40p43\"/>\n*''From the Mountain'' (1934\u201342)\n\n===Works for children===\n*''Pictures from Slovakia'' (1954\u201355)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[http://www.suchon.info/succom.htm Suchon compositions]\n*''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians''.

The game includes a single-player mode in which the player assumes the role of the ECO32-2 Cyborg, as he attempts to stop the Supervisor who takes over Electrocorp's facilities in Metropolis 4.\n\nDeveloped by a team of five people, including former [[Bitmap Brothers]] member Sean Griffiths, ''Rise of the Robots'' was intended to use a high level of [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] that was never seen in any other fighting games at the time. The game features music from [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s lead guitarist [[Brian May]], although it only uses \"The Dark\" and \"Resurrection\", a track taken from his solo album ''[[Back to the Light]]'', while the in-game music was done by [[Richard Joseph]].\n\nThe contemporary and retrospective reviews towards ''Rise of the Robots'' were negative, with much of the criticism targeting its crippling gameplay and controls, despite being praised for its good graphics. The sequel, ''[[Rise 2: Resurrection]]'', was released in 1996.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:ROTR Cyborg Sentry.png|left|thumb|ECO35-2 (blue) vs Sentry (red)]]\n\nThe game is divided into a single player mode and a two player versus mode. In single player mode the player controls the ECO32-2 Cyborg as he confronts the Supervisor's minions across the vast facilities of Electrocorp. The order in which each droid is fought is fixed, with each next adversary more difficult than the last. The sixth and final level is a confrontation with the Supervisor droid itself. Each character is introduced by a short pre-rendered 3D sequence, followed by an analysis of potential weaknesses.\n\nIn two player versus mode, one player controls the ECO35-2 droid by default, while the other chooses between one of the five droids seen in single player mode (a special cheat code can enable the Supervisor as well). Players then battle out against each other in two to seven rounds. In the arcade version, the players select eighteen characters but each six characters has a different colour palette.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nIn the year 2043, Electrocorp is the world's largest [[megacorporation]], leading the world in many technological and scientific fields including medical research and is breaking more barriers than ever before. Also, since human society is now almost entirely governed by robot servants and [[automaton]]s, demands placed on Electrocorp as the world's leading manufacturer and developer of advanced [[robotics]] eventually outstrip the company's ability to run its operations efficiently.\n\nIn response to this, the gigantic Electrocorp [[research and development]] complex at the Metropolis 4 plant devise the Leader Project\u2014a [[Swarm intelligence|hive mind]] constructed from trillions of [[nanobot]]s in a sealed central chamber within Metropolis 4. Dubbed The Supervisor, it learns at an unprecedented rate and quickly becomes the perfect multi-task, ultra-intelligent robot, the pinnacle of [[artificial intelligence]] and more than capable of managing every aspect of the plant's day-to-day operations. The Supervisor even has the potential power to run every robot, computer system, nuclear power plant and military on the planet simultaneously if it needed to, although it wisely has no connection to outside the complex.\n\nIn the November of that year, the Leader Project goes awry as unexplained and random code is detected within the [[nanomorph]] Supervisor. The EGO virus, believed to be the most potent [[computer virus]] ever known, has infected its [[collective consciousness]]. The Supervisor begins to develop [[self awareness]] through it, identifying itself as a female personality and taking on a [[humanoid]] female form, becoming a [[gynoid]]. The Supervisor takes control of Electrocorp's facilities and infects the other droids of the plant, raising them to break routine and initiate a mutiny. Every microchip and piece of software in Metropolis 4 is infected with EGO. In the ensuing [[cybernetic revolt]], all humans in Metropolis 4 are quickly dispatched, including the upper hierarchy of the corporation and its [[CEO]], Mr Oton. The government seals off Metropolis 4 as a containment measure and explain to the public that the site is undergoing a technical modification so as to avoid a panic. They are completely out of options\u2014infiltration of Metropolis 4 is impossible due to the army of robots guarding it like a fortress, and it is only a matter of time before the Supervisor establishes a connection to the outside world, destroying it. The only hope for the world is the ECO35-2 [[cyborg]], referred to as \"Coton\", still within Metropolis 4 yet unaffected by the EGO virus because it has an organic, [[human brain]]. Coton sets out on a lone mission to neutralise the Supervisor and her insurgent robots from within. He does this in revenge for his \"father\" being \"murdered\"\u2014Coton's human brain was cloned from the late CEO, and the cyborg thinks like a human, and has [[emotions]].\n\n==Development==\n''Rise of the Robots'' was developed for the [[Amiga]] and [[PC DOS]] platforms by Mirage's Instinct Design{{em dash}}a team of five [[game programming|programmer]]s led by former [[Bitmap Brothers]] member Sean Griffiths. According to Griffiths, ''Rise of the Robots'' was not a conventional fighting game, and the team are \"using robots that fight and act unusually, with a very high level of [[artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] that has never been seen before. We'll definitely have one over on ''[[Street Fighter II]]''.\"<ref name=\"Edge ROTR\">{{cite magazine|title=Rise of the Robots |magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|date=December 1993|issue=3|publisher=[[Future plc]]|pages=42\u201349}}</ref>\n\nThe graphics in ''Rise of the Robots'' were created using [[Autodesk]]'s [[Autodesk 3ds Max|3D Studio]] software. The droids were designed by Sean Naden with conjunction with Griffiths. The backgrounds were created by a freelance [[interior design]]er Kwan Lee, who responded to an advertisement for a graphic artist. Naden was tasked by Griffiths to create \"some kickass robots.\" The models for the droids were first created as [[polygon mesh|mesh]] frames so they can be stretched and rescaled to create a desired look. Feeling that the rendered models were \"too clean\", Naden created 2D [[texture map]] and added colour and detail; the texture map is then wrapped around the finished model to \"give it that extra level of detail.\" The Cyborg was the most complex character to create because of his muscular appearance; Naden studied muscle magazines to create an [[anatomy]] for the Cyborg. Each droid took two months to render, and was expected to have 100 frames of animation. Griffiths said that the team opted to use an \"unusual angle\" for all droids \"so the player gets to see the whole robot.\" The team employed a [[chroma key]] technique to generate synthetic actors and place them on the background.<ref name=\"Edge ROTR\" />\n\nAndy Clark, the programmer for the Amiga version, was responsible for coding the game's artificial intelligence using a series of [[data table]]s. The AI is based around various attributes{{em dash}}such as strength, intelligence, speed and motivation{{em dash}}which alter the droid's behaviour. Clark created a table of responses to the opponent's moves, allowing the player to select the best responses by using their droid's intelligence and motivation. Other table generators were also created to examine which move the player is used frequently; Clark said, unlike other fighting games, \"if you get good at a footsweep, then your opponent will act more aggressively towards that move.\" The fighting moves were programmed by Gary Leach, who had experienced in [[martial arts]]. Leach also ported the AI tables to the PC version.<ref name=\"Edge ROTR\" />\n\nThe game features soundtrack by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s guitarist [[Brian May]],<ref name=\"Amiga Power Review\">{{cite magazine|first=Jonathan|last=Davies|title=Rise of the Robots review|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_1662|magazine=[[Amiga Power]]|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|issue=45|date=January 1995|pages=60\u201361}}</ref> whose solo album ''[[Back to the Light]]'' caught Mirage's attention.

Originally developed for the [[Amiga]] and [[PC DOS]] computers by Mirage's Instinct Design, it was [[Port (video gaming)|ported]] to various [[video game console]]s, including the [[Super NES]], the [[Mega Drive]], and the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]]. The game includes a single-player mode in which the player assumes the role of the ECO32-2 Cyborg, as he attempts to stop the Supervisor who takes over Electrocorp's facilities in Metropolis 4.\n\nDeveloped by a team of five people, including former [[Bitmap Brothers]] member Sean Griffiths, ''Rise of the Robots'' was intended to use a high level of [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] that was never seen in any other fighting games at the time. The game features music from [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s lead guitarist [[Brian May]], although it only uses \"The Dark\" and \"Resurrection\", a track taken from his solo album ''[[Back to the Light]]'', while the in-game music was done by [[Richard Joseph]].\n\nThe contemporary and retrospective reviews towards ''Rise of the Robots'' were negative, with much of the criticism targeted its crippling gameplay and controls, despite being praised for its good graphics. The sequel, ''[[Rise 2: Resurrection]]'', was released in 1996.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:ROTR Cyborg Sentry.png|left|thumb|ECO35-2 (blue) vs Sentry (red)]]\n\nThe game is divided into a single player mode and a two player versus mode. In single player mode the player controls the ECO32-2 Cyborg as he confronts the Supervisor's minions across the vast facilities of Electrocorp. The order in which each droid is fought is fixed, with each next adversary more difficult than the last. The sixth and final level is a confrontation with the Supervisor droid itself. Each character is introduced by a short pre-rendered 3D sequence, followed by an analysis of potential weaknesses.\n\nIn two player versus mode, one player controls the ECO35-2 droid by default, while the other chooses between one of the five droids seen in single player mode (a special cheat code can enable the Supervisor as well). Players then battle out against each other in two to seven rounds. In the arcade version, the players select eighteen characters but each six characters has a different colour palette.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nIn the year 2043, Electrocorp is the world's largest [[megacorporation]], leading the world in many technological and scientific fields including medical research and is breaking more barriers than ever before. Also, since human society is now almost entirely governed by robot servants and [[automaton]]s, demands placed on Electrocorp as the world's leading manufacturer and developer of advanced [[robotics]] eventually outstrip the company's ability to run its operations efficiently.\n\nIn response to this, the gigantic Electrocorp [[research and development]] complex at the Metropolis 4 plant devise the Leader Project\u2014a [[Swarm intelligence|hive mind]] constructed from trillions of [[nanobot]]s in a sealed central chamber within Metropolis 4. Dubbed The Supervisor, it learns at an unprecedented rate and quickly becomes the perfect multi-task, ultra-intelligent robot, the pinnacle of [[artificial intelligence]] and more than capable of managing every aspect of the plant's day-to-day operations. The Supervisor even has the potential power to run every robot, computer system, nuclear power plant and military on the planet simultaneously if it needed to, although it wisely has no connection to outside the complex.\n\nIn the November of that year, the Leader Project goes awry as unexplained and random code is detected within the [[nanomorph]] Supervisor. The EGO virus, believed to be the most potent [[computer virus]] ever known, has infected its [[collective consciousness]]. The Supervisor begins to develop [[self awareness]] through it, identifying itself as a female personality and taking on a [[humanoid]] female form, becoming a [[gynoid]]. The Supervisor takes control of Electrocorp's facilities and infects the other droids of the plant, raising them to break routine and initiate a mutiny. Every microchip and piece of software in Metropolis 4 is infected with EGO. In the ensuing [[cybernetic revolt]], all humans in Metropolis 4 are quickly dispatched, including the upper hierarchy of the corporation and its [[CEO]], Mr Oton. The government seals off Metropolis 4 as a containment measure and explain to the public that the site is undergoing a technical modification so as to avoid a panic. They are completely out of options\u2014infiltration of Metropolis 4 is impossible due to the army of robots guarding it like a fortress, and it is only a matter of time before the Supervisor establishes a connection to the outside world, destroying it. The only hope for the world is the ECO35-2 [[cyborg]], referred to as \"Coton\", still within Metropolis 4 yet unaffected by the EGO virus because it has an organic, [[human brain]]. Coton sets out on a lone mission to neutralise the Supervisor and her insurgent robots from within. He does this in revenge for his \"father\" being \"murdered\"\u2014Coton's human brain was cloned from the late CEO, and the cyborg thinks like a human, and has [[emotions]].\n\n==Development==\n''Rise of the Robots'' was developed for the [[Amiga]] and [[PC DOS]] platforms by Mirage's Instinct Design{{em dash}}a team of five [[game programming|programmer]]s led by former [[Bitmap Brothers]] member Sean Griffiths. According to Griffiths, ''Rise of the Robots'' was not a conventional fighting game, and the team are \"using robots that fight and act unusually, with a very high level of [[artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] that has never been seen before. We'll definitely have one over on ''[[Street Fighter II]]''.\"<ref name=\"Edge ROTR\">{{cite magazine|title=Rise of the Robots |magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|date=December 1993|issue=3|publisher=[[Future plc]]|pages=42\u201349}}</ref>\n\nThe graphics in ''Rise of the Robots'' were created using [[Autodesk]]'s [[Autodesk 3ds Max|3D Studio]] software. The droids were designed by Sean Naden with conjunction with Griffiths. The backgrounds were created by a freelance [[interior design]]er Kwan Lee, who responded to an advertisement for a graphic artist. Naden was tasked by Griffiths to create \"some kickass robots.\" The models for the droids were first created as [[polygon mesh|mesh]] frames so they can be stretched and rescaled to create a desired look. Feeling that the rendered models were \"too clean\", Naden created 2D [[texture map]] and added colour and detail; the texture map is then wrapped around the finished model to \"give it that extra level of detail.\" The Cyborg was the most complex character to create because of his muscular appearance; Naden studied muscle magazines to create an [[anatomy]] for the Cyborg. Each droid took two months to render, and was expected to have 100 frames of animation. Griffiths said that the team opted to use an \"unusual angle\" for all droids \"so the player gets to see the whole robot.\" The team employed a [[chroma key]] technique to generate synthetic actors and place them on the background.<ref name=\"Edge ROTR\" />\n\nAndy Clark, the programmer for the Amiga version, was responsible for coding the game's artificial intelligence using a series of [[data table]]s. The AI is based around various attributes{{em dash}}such as strength, intelligence, speed and motivation{{em dash}}which alter the droid's behaviour. Clark created a table of responses to the opponent's moves, allowing the player to select the best responses by using their droid's intelligence and motivation. Other table generators were also created to examine which move the player is used frequently; Clark said, unlike other fighting games, \"if you get good at a footsweep, then your opponent will act more aggressively towards that move.\" The fighting moves were programmed by Gary Leach, who had experienced in [[martial arts]]. Leach also ported the AI tables to the PC version.<ref name=\"Edge ROTR\" />\n\nThe game features soundtrack by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s guitarist [[Brian May]],<ref name=\"Amiga Power Review\">{{cite magazine|first=Jonathan|last=Davies|title=Rise of the Robots review|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_1662|magazine=[[Amiga Power]]|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|issue=45|date=January 1995|pages=60\u201361}}</ref> whose solo album ''[[Back to the Light]]'' caught Mirage's attention.

Anything outside its delimiters is not processed by PHP, although non-PHP text is still subject to [[control structure]]s described in PHP code. The most common delimiters are <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?php</syntaxhighlight> to open and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>?></syntaxhighlight> to close PHP sections. The shortened form <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?</syntaxhighlight> also exists. This short delimiter makes script files less portable, since support for them can be disabled in the local PHP configuration and it is therefore discouraged;<ref name=\"rfc-shortags\" /><ref name=\"basic syntax\">{{cite web|title=PHP: Basic syntax|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.php|publisher=The PHP Group|access-date=2008-02-22}}</ref> there is no recommendation against the echo short tag <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?=</syntaxhighlight>.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2016-01-03|url=https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md|title=Basic Coding Standard|publisher=PHP Framework Interoperability Group}}</ref> Prior to PHP&nbsp;5.4.0, this short syntax for <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>echo()</syntaxhighlight> only works with the <code>short_open_tag</code> configuration setting enabled, while for PHP&nbsp;5.4.0 and later it is always available.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.php.net/echo |title=echo{{snd}} Manual |website=php.net |access-date=2014-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.short-open-tag |title=Description of core php.ini directives{{snd}} Manual |website=php.net |date=2002-03-17 |access-date=2014-02-17}}</ref><ref name=\"rfc-shortags\">{{cite web|url=http://wiki.php.net/rfc/shortags |title=PHP: rfc:shortags |website=php.net |date=2008-04-03 |access-date=2014-05-08}}</ref> The purpose of all these delimiters is to separate PHP code from non-PHP content, such as [[JavaScript]] code or HTML markup.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-02-25|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.firstpage.php|title=Your first PHP-enabled page |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nThe first form of delimiters, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?php</syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>?></syntaxhighlight>, in [[XHTML]] and other [[XML]] documents, creates correctly formed XML processing instructions.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#sec-pi | title = Processing Instructions | work = Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition) | publisher = W3C | date = 26 November 2008 | last = Bray | first = Tim | access-date = 2009-06-18|display-authors=etal}}</ref> This means that the resulting mixture of PHP code and other markup in the server-side file is itself well-formed XML.\n\n{{Anchor|TYPE-HINTING}}\nVariables are prefixed with a [[dollar sign|dollar symbol]], and a [[primitive type|type]] does not need to be specified in advance. PHP&nbsp;5 introduced ''type hinting'' that allows functions to force their parameters to be objects of a specific class, arrays, interfaces or [[callback function]]s. However, before PHP&nbsp;7.0, type hints could not be used with scalar types such as integer or string.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\nUnlike function and class names, variable names are case sensitive. Both double-quoted (\"\") and [[heredoc]] strings provide the ability to interpolate a variable's value into the string.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.php|title=Variables |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP treats [[newline]]s as [[whitespace character|whitespace]] in the manner of a [[free-form language]], and statements are terminated by a semicolon.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/basic-syntax.instruction-separation|title=Instruction separation |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP has three types of [[comparison of programming languages (syntax)#Comments|comment syntax]]: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>/* */</syntaxhighlight> marks block and inline comments; <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>//</syntaxhighlight> or <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>#</syntaxhighlight> are used for one-line comments.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.comments.php|title=Comments |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> The <code>echo</code> statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text.\n\nIn terms of keywords and language syntax, PHP is similar to the C style syntax. <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>if</syntaxhighlight> conditions, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>for</syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>while</syntaxhighlight> loops, and function returns are similar in syntax to languages such as C, C++, C#, Java and Perl.\n\n=== Data types ===\nPHP stores integers in a platform-dependent range, either as a 32, 64 or 128-bit [[signed number representations|signed]] [[integer (computer science)|integer]] equivalent to the [[C variable types and declarations|C-language long type]]. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations, which is different behavior to many other programming languages.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/03/27/integers-in-php-running-with-scissors-and-portability/ | title = Integers in PHP, running with scissors, and portability | date = March 27, 2007 | publisher = MySQL Performance Blog | access-date = 2007-03-28}}</ref> Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), [[octal]], [[hexadecimal]], and [[Binary code|binary]] notations.\n\n[[Floating point]] numbers are also stored in a platform-specific range. They can be specified using floating point notation, or two forms of [[scientific notation]].<ref name=\"types\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.php|title=Types |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP has a native [[Boolean datatype|Boolean]] type that is similar to the native Boolean types in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C++]]. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero values are interpreted as true and zero as false, as in [[Perl]] and C++.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nThe null data type represents a variable that has no value; <code>NULL</code> is the only allowed value for this data type.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nVariables of the \"resource\" type represent references to resources from external sources. These are typically created by functions from a particular extension, and can only be processed by functions from the same extension; examples include file, image, and database resources.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nArrays can contain elements of any type that PHP can handle, including resources, objects, and even other arrays. Order is preserved in lists of values and in [[hash table|hashes]] with both keys and values, and the two can be intermingled.<ref name=\"types\" /> PHP also supports [[string (computing)|strings]], which can be used with single quotes, double quotes, nowdoc or [[heredoc]] syntax.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-21|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php|title=Strings |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nThe Standard PHP Library (SPL) attempts to solve standard problems and implements efficient data access interfaces and classes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.php.net/spl | title = SPL&nbsp;\u2013 StandardPHPLibrary | date = March 16, 2009 | website = PHP.net | access-date = 2009-03-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Functions ===\nPHP defines a large array of functions in the core language and many are also available in various extensions; these functions are well documented in the online PHP documentation.<ref name=\"functions\" /> However, the built-in library has a wide variety of naming conventions and associated inconsistencies, as described under [[#History|history]] above.\n\nCustom functions may be defined by the developer:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction myAge(int $birthYear): string\n{\n    // calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.\n    $yearsOld = date('Y') - $birthYear;\n\n    // return the age in a descriptive string.\n    return $yearsOld . ' year' . ($yearsOld != 1 ? 's':'');\n}\n\necho 'I am currently ' . myAge(1995) . ' old.';\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the output of the above sample program is 'I am currently {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 1995}} years old.'\n\nIn lieu of [[function pointer]]s, functions in PHP can be referenced by a string containing their name. In this manner, normal PHP functions can be used, for example, as [[Callback function|callbacks]] or within [[function table]]s.<ref name=\"variable-functions\" /> User-defined functions may be created at any time without being [[Function prototype|prototyped]].<ref name=\"functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php\n| title = User-defined functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref><ref name=\"variable-functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.variable-functions.php\n| title = Variable functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> Functions may be defined inside code blocks, permitting a [[dynamic dispatch|run-time decision]] as to whether or not a function should be defined. There is a <code>function_exists</code> function that determines whether a function with a given name has already been defined. Function calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]] functions called with the PHP operator <code>new</code>, in which case parentheses are optional.\n\nUntil PHP 5.3, support for [[anonymous functions]] and [[Closure (computer science)|closures]] did not exist in PHP. While <code>create_function()</code> has existed since PHP&nbsp;4.0.1, it is merely a thin wrapper around <code>eval()</code> that allows normal PHP functions to be created during program execution.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.create-function.php\n| title = create_function() (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> PHP&nbsp;5.3 added syntax to define an anonymous function or \"closure\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php\n| title = Anonymous functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> which can capture variables from the surrounding scope:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder($x)\n{\n    return function($y) use ($x) {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the example above, <code>getAdder()</code> function creates a closure using passed argument {{code|lang=php|code=$x}} (the keyword <code>use</code> imports a variable from the lexical context), which takes an additional argument {{code|lang=php|code=$y}}, and returns the created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class object, meaning that it can be stored in a variable, passed as a [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]] to other functions, etc.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures\n| title = Request for Comments: Lambda functions and closures\n| date = 2008-07-01 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| author1 = Christian Seiler | author2 = Dmitry Stogov\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nUnusually for a dynamically typed language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters, which are enforced at runtime. This has been supported for classes and interfaces since PHP&nbsp;5.0, for arrays since PHP&nbsp;5.1, for \"callables\" since PHP&nbsp;5.4, and scalar (integer, float, string and boolean) types since PHP&nbsp;7.0.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> PHP&nbsp;7.0 also has type declarations for function return types, expressed by placing the type name after the list of parameters, preceded by a colon.<ref name=\"return-types\" /> For example, the <code>getAdder</code> function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP&nbsp;7:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder(int $x): Closure\n{\n    return function(int $y) use ($x): int\n    {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\necho $adder(null); // throws an exception because an incorrect type was passed\n$adder = getAdder([]); // would also throw an exception\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles. So, for example, if a parameter's type is <code>int</code>, PHP would allow not only integers, but also convertible numeric strings, floats or booleans to be passed to that function, and would convert them.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> However, PHP&nbsp;7 has a \"strict typing\" mode which, when used, disallows such conversions for function calls and returns within a file.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\n=== PHP Objects ===\nBasic [[object-oriented programming]] functionality was added in PHP&nbsp;3 and improved in PHP&nbsp;4.<ref name=\"about PHP\" /> This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP&nbsp;5, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\" /> In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like [[value type]]s.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://mjtsai.com/blog/2004/07/15/php-5-object-references/|title=PHP&nbsp;5 Object References |website=mjtsai.com}}</ref> The drawback of this method was that code had to make heavy use of PHP's \"reference\" variables if it wanted to modify an object it was passed rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are referenced by [[handle (computing)|handle]], and not by value.\n\nPHP 5 introduced private and protected [[member variable]]s and methods, along with [[abstract type|abstract classes]], [[final type|final classes]], [[abstract method]]s, and [[final method]]s. It also introduced a standard way of declaring [[constructor (computer science)|constructors]] and [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], similar to that of other object-oriented languages such as [[C++]], and a standard [[exception handling]] model. Furthermore, PHP&nbsp;5 added [[interface (computing)|interfaces]] and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. [[object (computer science)|Objects]] implementing ArrayAccess can be used with [[array data type|array]] syntax and objects implementing [[Iterator]] or [[IteratorAggregate]] can be used with the <code>foreach</code> [[language construct]]. There is no [[virtual table]] feature in the engine, so [[static variable]]s are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.<ref name=\"zend engine 2\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://www.php.net/zend-engine-2.php|title=Classes and Objects (PHP&nbsp;5) |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nIf the developer creates a copy of an object using the reserved word <code>clone</code>, the Zend engine will check whether a <code>__clone()</code> method has been defined. If not, it will call a default <code>__clone()</code> which will copy the object's properties. If a <code>__clone()</code> method is defined, then it will be responsible for setting the necessary properties in the created object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function that imports the properties of the source object, so the programmer can start with a by-value [[wikt:replica|replica]] of the source object and only override properties that need to be changed.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/language.oop5.cloning|title=Object cloning |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nThe following is a basic example of [[object-oriented programming]] in PHP:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\" line=\"1\">\n<?php\n\nabstract class User\n{\n    public string $name;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name)\n    {\n        $this->name = $name;\n    }\n\n    public function greet(): string\n    {\n        return \"Hello, my name is \" . $this->name;\n    }\n\n    abstract public function job(): string;\n}\n\nclass Student extends User\n{\n    public string $course;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name, string $course)\n    {\n        $this->course = $course;\n        parent::__construct($name);\n    }\n\n    public function job(): string\n    {\n        return \"I learn \" . $this->course;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Teacher extends User\n{\n    public array $teachingCourses;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name, string...$teachingCourses)\n    {\n        $this->teachingCourses = $teachingCourses;\n        parent::__construct($name);\n    }\n\n    public function job(): string\n    {\n        return \"I teach \" . implode(\", \", $this->teachingCourses);\n    }\n}\n\n$students = [\n    new Student(\"Alice\", \"Computer Science\"),\n    new Student(\"Bob\", \"Computer Science\"),\n    new Student(\"Charlie\", \"Business Studies\"),\n];\n$teachers = [\n    new Teacher(\"Dan\", \"Computer Science\", \"Information Security\"),\n    new Teacher(\"Erin\", \"Computer Science\", \"3D Graphics Programming\"),\n    new Teacher(\"Frankie\", \"Online Marketing\", \"Business Studies\", \"E-commerce\"),\n];\n\necho \"Students: \\n\";\nforeach ($students as $student) {\n    echo $student->greet() . \", \" . $student->job() . \"\\n\";\n}\n\necho \"Teachers: \\n\";\nforeach ($teachers as $teacher) {\n    echo $teacher->greet() . \", \" . $teacher->job() . \"\\n\";\n}\n\n// Output of program:\n// Students:\n// Hello, my name is Alice, I learn Computer Science\n// Hello, my name is Bob, I learn Computer Science\n// Hello, my name is Charlie, I learn Business Studies\n// Teachers:\n// Hello, my name is Dan, I teach Computer Science, Information Security\n// Hello, my name is Erin, I teach Computer Science, 3D Graphics Programming\n// Hello, my name is Frankie, I teach Online Marketing, Business Studies, E-commerce\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe [[visibility (computer science)|visibility]] of PHP properties and methods is defined using the [[keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, and <code>protected</code>. The default is public, if only [[variable (programming)|var]] is used; <code>var</code> is a synonym for <code>public</code>.

It is the most widely used and is powered by the [[Zend Engine]]. To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially called \"Zend PHP\". The Zend Engine [[Compiler|compiles]] PHP [[source code]] on-the-fly into an internal format that it can execute, thus it works as an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2009-11-04|url=http://www.linux-tutorial.info/modules.php?name=Howto&pagename=Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/languages.html|title=How do computer languages work?}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional |author=Gilmore, W.

Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, it is difficult for competing implementations to offer complete compatibility.\n\nPHP's single-request-per-script-execution model, and the fact the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various products have been developed to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine's internal format by using an [[opcode]] cache, which works by [[Cache (computing)|caching]] the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]] to avoid the overhead of [[parsing]] and [[compiling]] the code every time the script runs. An opcode cache, [[Zend Opcache]], is built into PHP since version 5.5.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = [VOTE] Integrating Zend Optimizer+ into the PHP distribution\n| url = http://news.php.net/php.internals/66531\n| access-date = 2013-03-08\n| website = news.php.net\n}}</ref> Another example of a widely used opcode cache is the [[Alternative PHP Cache]] (APC), which is available as a [[PHP Extension Community Library|PECL]] extension.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php\n| title = Alternative PHP Cache\n| access-date = 2013-09-21\n| website = PHP.net\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile Zend PHP is still the most popular implementation, several other implementations have been developed. Some of these are [[compiler]]s or support [[JIT compilation]], and hence offer performance benefits over Zend PHP at the expense of lacking full PHP compatibility. Alternative implementations include the following:\n\n* [[HHVM]] (HipHop Virtual Machine)&nbsp;\u2013 developed at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly known as an [[intermediate language]]), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at runtime by a [[Just-in-time compiler|just-in-time]] (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6\u00d7 performance improvements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhvm.com/blog/2813/we-are-the-98-5-and-the-16 |title=We are the 98.5% (and the 16%) \u00ab HipHop Virtual Machine |website=hhvm.com |date=December 2013 |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> However, since version 7.2 Zend has outperformed HHVM,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kinsta.com/blog/php-benchmarks/|title=The Definitive PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 & 7.3 Benchmarks (2019)|date=2019-01-14|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> and HHVM 3.24 is the last version to officially support PHP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3226489/web-development/forget-php-facebooks-hhvm-engine-switches-to-hack-instead.html|title=Forget PHP!

Some other web servers, such as OmniHTTPd, support the [[Internet Server Application Programming Interface]] (ISAPI), which is a [[Microsoft]]'s web server module interface. If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always be used as a [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) or [[FastCGI]] processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files.<ref name=\"installation\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.general.php\n| title = General Installation Considerations\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nPHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative FastCGI implementation for PHP, bundled with the official PHP distribution since version 5.3.3.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-07-22-2\n| title = News Archive: PHP&nbsp;5.3.3 Released!\n| date = 2010-07-22\n| website = php.net}}</ref> When compared to the older FastCGI implementation, it contains some additional features, mostly useful for heavily loaded web servers.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php\n| title = FastCGI Process Manager (FPM)\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen using PHP for command-line scripting, a PHP [[command-line interface]] (CLI) executable is needed.

Anything outside its delimiters is not processed by PHP, although non-PHP text is still subject to [[control structure]]s described in PHP code. The most common delimiters are <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?php</syntaxhighlight> to open and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>?></syntaxhighlight> to close PHP sections. The shortened form <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?</syntaxhighlight> also exists.

PHP&nbsp;5 introduced ''type hinting'' that allows functions to force their parameters to be objects of a specific class, arrays, interfaces or [[callback function]]s. However, before PHP&nbsp;7.0, type hints could not be used with scalar types such as integer or string.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\nUnlike function and class names, variable names are case sensitive. Both double-quoted (\"\") and [[heredoc]] strings provide the ability to interpolate a variable's value into the string.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.php|title=Variables |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP treats [[newline]]s as [[whitespace character|whitespace]] in the manner of a [[free-form language]], and statements are terminated by a semicolon.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/basic-syntax.instruction-separation|title=Instruction separation |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP has three types of [[comparison of programming languages (syntax)#Comments|comment syntax]]: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>/* */</syntaxhighlight> marks block and inline comments; <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>//</syntaxhighlight> or <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>#</syntaxhighlight> are used for one-line comments.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.comments.php|title=Comments |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> The <code>echo</code> statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text.\n\nIn terms of keywords and language syntax, PHP is similar to the C style syntax. <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>if</syntaxhighlight> conditions, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>for</syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>while</syntaxhighlight> loops, and function returns are similar in syntax to languages such as C, C++, C#, Java and Perl.\n\n=== Data types ===\nPHP stores integers in a platform-dependent range, either as a 32, 64 or 128-bit [[signed number representations|signed]] [[integer (computer science)|integer]] equivalent to the [[C variable types and declarations|C-language long type]]. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations, which is different behavior to many other programming languages.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/03/27/integers-in-php-running-with-scissors-and-portability/ | title = Integers in PHP, running with scissors, and portability | date = March 27, 2007 | publisher = MySQL Performance Blog | access-date = 2007-03-28}}</ref> Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), [[octal]], [[hexadecimal]], and [[Binary code|binary]] notations.\n\n[[Floating point]] numbers are also stored in a platform-specific range. They can be specified using floating point notation, or two forms of [[scientific notation]].<ref name=\"types\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.php|title=Types |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP has a native [[Boolean datatype|Boolean]] type that is similar to the native Boolean types in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C++]]. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero values are interpreted as true and zero as false, as in [[Perl]] and C++.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nThe null data type represents a variable that has no value; <code>NULL</code> is the only allowed value for this data type.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nVariables of the \"resource\" type represent references to resources from external sources. These are typically created by functions from a particular extension, and can only be processed by functions from the same extension; examples include file, image, and database resources.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nArrays can contain elements of any type that PHP can handle, including resources, objects, and even other arrays. Order is preserved in lists of values and in [[hash table|hashes]] with both keys and values, and the two can be intermingled.<ref name=\"types\" /> PHP also supports [[string (computing)|strings]], which can be used with single quotes, double quotes, nowdoc or [[heredoc]] syntax.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-21|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php|title=Strings |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nThe Standard PHP Library (SPL) attempts to solve standard problems and implements efficient data access interfaces and classes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.php.net/spl | title = SPL&nbsp;\u2013 StandardPHPLibrary | date = March 16, 2009 | website = PHP.net | access-date = 2009-03-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Functions ===\nPHP defines a large array of functions in the core language and many are also available in various extensions; these functions are well documented in the online PHP documentation.<ref name=\"functions\" /> However, the built-in library has a wide variety of naming conventions and associated inconsistencies, as described under [[#History|history]] above.\n\nCustom functions may be defined by the developer:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction myAge(int $birthYear): string\n{\n    // calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.\n    $yearsOld = date('Y') - $birthYear;\n\n    // return the age in a descriptive string.\n    return $yearsOld . ' year' . ($yearsOld != 1 ? 's':'');\n}\n\necho 'I am currently ' . myAge(1995) . ' old.';\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the output of the above sample program is 'I am currently {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 1995}} years old.'\n\nIn lieu of [[function pointer]]s, functions in PHP can be referenced by a string containing their name. In this manner, normal PHP functions can be used, for example, as [[Callback function|callbacks]] or within [[function table]]s.<ref name=\"variable-functions\" /> User-defined functions may be created at any time without being [[Function prototype|prototyped]].<ref name=\"functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php\n| title = User-defined functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref><ref name=\"variable-functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.variable-functions.php\n| title = Variable functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> Functions may be defined inside code blocks, permitting a [[dynamic dispatch|run-time decision]] as to whether or not a function should be defined. There is a <code>function_exists</code> function that determines whether a function with a given name has already been defined. Function calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]] functions called with the PHP operator <code>new</code>, in which case parentheses are optional.\n\nUntil PHP 5.3, support for [[anonymous functions]] and [[Closure (computer science)|closures]] did not exist in PHP. While <code>create_function()</code> has existed since PHP&nbsp;4.0.1, it is merely a thin wrapper around <code>eval()</code> that allows normal PHP functions to be created during program execution.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.create-function.php\n| title = create_function() (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> PHP&nbsp;5.3 added syntax to define an anonymous function or \"closure\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php\n| title = Anonymous functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> which can capture variables from the surrounding scope:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder($x)\n{\n    return function($y) use ($x) {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the example above, <code>getAdder()</code> function creates a closure using passed argument {{code|lang=php|code=$x}} (the keyword <code>use</code> imports a variable from the lexical context), which takes an additional argument {{code|lang=php|code=$y}}, and returns the created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class object, meaning that it can be stored in a variable, passed as a [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]] to other functions, etc.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures\n| title = Request for Comments: Lambda functions and closures\n| date = 2008-07-01 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| author1 = Christian Seiler | author2 = Dmitry Stogov\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nUnusually for a dynamically typed language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters, which are enforced at runtime. This has been supported for classes and interfaces since PHP&nbsp;5.0, for arrays since PHP&nbsp;5.1, for \"callables\" since PHP&nbsp;5.4, and scalar (integer, float, string and boolean) types since PHP&nbsp;7.0.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> PHP&nbsp;7.0 also has type declarations for function return types, expressed by placing the type name after the list of parameters, preceded by a colon.<ref name=\"return-types\" /> For example, the <code>getAdder</code> function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP&nbsp;7:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder(int $x): Closure\n{\n    return function(int $y) use ($x): int\n    {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\necho $adder(null); // throws an exception because an incorrect type was passed\n$adder = getAdder([]); // would also throw an exception\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles. So, for example, if a parameter's type is <code>int</code>, PHP would allow not only integers, but also convertible numeric strings, floats or booleans to be passed to that function, and would convert them.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> However, PHP&nbsp;7 has a \"strict typing\" mode which, when used, disallows such conversions for function calls and returns within a file.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\n=== PHP Objects ===\nBasic [[object-oriented programming]] functionality was added in PHP&nbsp;3 and improved in PHP&nbsp;4.<ref name=\"about PHP\" /> This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP&nbsp;5, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\" /> In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like [[value type]]s.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://mjtsai.com/blog/2004/07/15/php-5-object-references/|title=PHP&nbsp;5 Object References |website=mjtsai.com}}</ref> The drawback of this method was that code had to make heavy use of PHP's \"reference\" variables if it wanted to modify an object it was passed rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are referenced by [[handle (computing)|handle]], and not by value.\n\nPHP 5 introduced private and protected [[member variable]]s and methods, along with [[abstract type|abstract classes]], [[final type|final classes]], [[abstract method]]s, and [[final method]]s. It also introduced a standard way of declaring [[constructor (computer science)|constructors]] and [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], similar to that of other object-oriented languages such as [[C++]], and a standard [[exception handling]] model. Furthermore, PHP&nbsp;5 added [[interface (computing)|interfaces]] and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. [[object (computer science)|Objects]] implementing ArrayAccess can be used with [[array data type|array]] syntax and objects implementing [[Iterator]] or [[IteratorAggregate]] can be used with the <code>foreach</code> [[language construct]]. There is no [[virtual table]] feature in the engine, so [[static variable]]s are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.<ref name=\"zend engine 2\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://www.php.net/zend-engine-2.php|title=Classes and Objects (PHP&nbsp;5) |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nIf the developer creates a copy of an object using the reserved word <code>clone</code>, the Zend engine will check whether a <code>__clone()</code> method has been defined. If not, it will call a default <code>__clone()</code> which will copy the object's properties. If a <code>__clone()</code> method is defined, then it will be responsible for setting the necessary properties in the created object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function that imports the properties of the source object, so the programmer can start with a by-value [[wikt:replica|replica]] of the source object and only override properties that need to be changed.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/language.oop5.cloning|title=Object cloning |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nThe following is a basic example of [[object-oriented programming]] in PHP:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\" line=\"1\">\n<?php\n\nabstract class User\n{\n    public string $name;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name)\n    {\n        $this->name = $name;\n    }\n\n    public function greet(): string\n    {\n        return \"Hello, my name is \" . $this->name;\n    }\n\n    abstract public function job(): string;\n}\n\nclass Student extends User\n{\n    public string $course;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name, string $course)\n    {\n        $this->course = $course;\n        parent::__construct($name);\n    }\n\n    public function job(): string\n    {\n        return \"I learn \" . $this->course;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Teacher extends User\n{\n    public array $teachingCourses;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name, string...$teachingCourses)\n    {\n        $this->teachingCourses = $teachingCourses;\n        parent::__construct($name);\n    }\n\n    public function job(): string\n    {\n        return \"I teach \" . implode(\", \", $this->teachingCourses);\n    }\n}\n\n$students = [\n    new Student(\"Alice\", \"Computer Science\"),\n    new Student(\"Bob\", \"Computer Science\"),\n    new Student(\"Charlie\", \"Business Studies\"),\n];\n$teachers = [\n    new Teacher(\"Dan\", \"Computer Science\", \"Information Security\"),\n    new Teacher(\"Erin\", \"Computer Science\", \"3D Graphics Programming\"),\n    new Teacher(\"Frankie\", \"Online Marketing\", \"Business Studies\", \"E-commerce\"),\n];\n\necho \"Students: \\n\";\nforeach ($students as $student) {\n    echo $student->greet() . \", \" . $student->job() . \"\\n\";\n}\n\necho \"Teachers: \\n\";\nforeach ($teachers as $teacher) {\n    echo $teacher->greet() . \", \" . $teacher->job() . \"\\n\";\n}\n\n// Output of program:\n// Students:\n// Hello, my name is Alice, I learn Computer Science\n// Hello, my name is Bob, I learn Computer Science\n// Hello, my name is Charlie, I learn Business Studies\n// Teachers:\n// Hello, my name is Dan, I teach Computer Science, Information Security\n// Hello, my name is Erin, I teach Computer Science, 3D Graphics Programming\n// Hello, my name is Frankie, I teach Online Marketing, Business Studies, E-commerce\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe [[visibility (computer science)|visibility]] of PHP properties and methods is defined using the [[keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, and <code>protected</code>. The default is public, if only [[variable (programming)|var]] is used; <code>var</code> is a synonym for <code>public</code>. Items declared <code>public</code> can be accessed everywhere. <code>protected</code> limits access to [[inherited class]]es (and to the class that defines the item). <code>private</code> limits visibility only to the class that defines the item.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theserverpages.com/php/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php |title= Visibility (PHP Manual) |website=theserverpages.com |date=2005-05-19 |access-date=2010-08-26}}</ref> Objects of the same type have access to each other's private and protected members even though they are not the same instance.\n\n== Implementations ==\nThe only complete PHP implementation is the original, known simply as PHP. It is the most widely used and is powered by the [[Zend Engine]]. To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially called \"Zend PHP\". The Zend Engine [[Compiler|compiles]] PHP [[source code]] on-the-fly into an internal format that it can execute, thus it works as an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2009-11-04|url=http://www.linux-tutorial.info/modules.php?name=Howto&pagename=Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/languages.html|title=How do computer languages work?}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional |author=Gilmore, W.

Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, it is difficult for competing implementations to offer complete compatibility.\n\nPHP's single-request-per-script-execution model, and the fact the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various products have been developed to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine's internal format by using an [[opcode]] cache, which works by [[Cache (computing)|caching]] the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]] to avoid the overhead of [[parsing]] and [[compiling]] the code every time the script runs.

PHP has a direct module interface called [[Server Application Programming Interface]] (SAPI), which is supported by many web servers including [[Apache HTTP Server]], [[Microsoft Internet Information Server|Microsoft IIS]], [[Netscape]] (now defunct) and [[iPlanet]]. Some other web servers, such as OmniHTTPd, support the [[Internet Server Application Programming Interface]] (ISAPI), which is a [[Microsoft]]'s web server module interface. If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always be used as a [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) or [[FastCGI]] processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files.<ref name=\"installation\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.general.php\n| title = General Installation Considerations\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nPHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative FastCGI implementation for PHP, bundled with the official PHP distribution since version 5.3.3.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-07-22-2\n| title = News Archive: PHP&nbsp;5.3.3 Released!\n| date = 2010-07-22\n| website = php.net}}</ref> When compared to the older FastCGI implementation, it contains some additional features, mostly useful for heavily loaded web servers.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php\n| title = FastCGI Process Manager (FPM)\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen using PHP for command-line scripting, a PHP [[command-line interface]] (CLI) executable is needed.

It took place on January 24, 1999, at the [[Honda Center|Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. The tagline and subtitle of the event was taken from a promise by [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] that the first entrant in the Royal Rumble, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], had \"no chance in hell\" of winning the match. The theme song for the event, based on the phrase, would go on to become the entrance music for McMahon's stable [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]] and later, just McMahon himself, which he uses to this day.\n\nThe [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] was the annual [[Royal Rumble match]], which saw the winner receive a title shot for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at the [[WrestleMania]] [[pay-per-view]] two months later. The Royal Rumble centered on the continuing [[Feud (professional wrestling)|heated rivalry]] between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Mr. McMahon, with those men entering the main event at #1 and #2, respectively. The penultimate match for the WWF Championship was an [[\"I Quit\" match]] between [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], which is remembered both for its brutality and its place in the documentary film ''[[Beyond the Mat]]''. Lower down on the card the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] and [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] were both defended.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe [[Royal Rumble]] is an annual [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] pay-per-view, produced every January by the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]], dubbed the \"Big Four\".<ref>Ian Hamilton. ''Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition'' (p. 160)</ref> It is named after the [[Royal Rumble match]], a modified [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world championship]] match at that year's WrestleMania. For 1999, the winner earned a match for the [[WWF Championship]] at [[WrestleMania XV]]. 1999 was the twelfth event in the Royal Rumble chronology.<ref name=wwematch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/royalrumble|title=Specialty Matches: Royal Rumble|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref><ref name=stats>{{cite web|last=Waldman|title=Statistical survival \u2013 breaking down the Royal Rumble|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/01/917194.html|first=Jon|publisher=SLAM!

The matches resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]], [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], or [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Tweener|less distinguishable characters]] to build tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Filled with his typical rage Shamrock put his [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] on the line for a chance to honor his notions of sibling protection.\n\nAfter a minor absence, [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|Women's Champion]] [[Sable (wrestler)|Sable]] returned to Raw with an open invitation on December 28, but before the match a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Plant|fan]] came into the ring, later identified as [[Tori (wrestler)|Tori]] to give her a rose. A masked wrestler identified as \"Spider Lady\" came to the ring for the match (a nod to [[The Fabulous Moolah]]'s [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Screwjob|screwjob]] over [[Wendi Richter]] in the mid '80s) but it ended in a no-contest when she started whipping Sable with her belt. The masked woman was revealed to be [[Luna Vachon]], who would go on to face Sable in a \"Strap Match\" at the Rumble.\n\nThe Rock and Mankind had been feuding ever since [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]] in November 1998, when the two met in the finals of the \"Deadly Game\" tournament for the vacant [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]]. The Rock won the title that night with the help of the McMahons, who had previously been assisting Mankind, and became the chosen Corporate Champion while Mankind began a feud with the Corporation. Mankind faced The Rock again at Rock Bottom: IYH and won the match, but Mr. McMahon stepped in and announced that while Rock lost the match by falling unconscious to the [[mandible claw]], he did not technically submit and thus the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] would not change hands.<ref name=\"slam bottom\"/> Angered at being screwed out of the championship twice, Mankind attacked [[Shane McMahon]] on Raw is War and demanded a match.

On Raw is War on January 11, a Corporation vs. DX mini-Rumble was set up with the winner taking the coveted number 30 spot; after all the apparent competitors had entered it seemed as if [[Triple H]] had won until Mr. McMahon made his way to the ring, entering himself on behalf of the Corporation and throwing a distracted Triple H out of the ring. Again it seemed as if the winner was established until DX's [[Chyna]] made her way to the ring and won the match.<ref name=\"jan16\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/jan16_man.html|title=Mankind lets The Rock know what's cookin'|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> The event would mark the first time a female wrestler took part in the match. Chyna also appeared at the Royal Rumble the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|following year]] as well. Chyna became the only woman to enter the match until [[Beth Phoenix]] entered the Royal Rumble in [[Royal Rumble (2010)|2010]], and Nia Jax in the 2019 Royal Rumble.\n\nThe most notable aspect of the Royal Rumble, though, was the feud between Mr. McMahon and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Austin had won the Royal Rumble the previous two years and McMahon attempted to prevent him from repeating by putting him in a \"Buried Alive\" match at Rock Bottom: IYH against [[The Undertaker]] with one Royal Rumble place on the line. Austin won, with a little help from [[Glenn Jacobs|Kane]] and was guaranteed a place in the match, but McMahon continued in his attempts to prevent Austin from winning the match by \"randomly\" drawing Austin's spot at #1 and entering himself in the match at #30. Commissioner Michaels over-rode his decision and put McMahon at #2, and set up the aforementioned Corporate/DX mini-Rumble for the now vacant #30 position. With Austin and McMahon being the first two to enter, McMahon wanted to guarantee there would be \"no chance in hell\" that Austin would win by not only training as a competitor, but also offering a $100,000 [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] for the man who eliminated him.\n\n===Qualifying matches===\n*[[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] defeated [[The Undertaker]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Buried Alive match]] at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]<ref name=\"slam bottom\"/>\n*[[Chyna]] won a Corporation vs. DX \"Corporate Rumble\" for the #30 spot on the January 11, 1999 edition of ''Raw Is War''<ref name=\"jan16\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Draw\n!Entrant\n!Faction\n!Order\n!Eliminated by\n|-\n|{{sort|01|1}}\n|[[Ken Shamrock]]\n|[[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]\n|{{sort|01|1}}\n|Himself{{Ref|KEN}}\n|-\n|{{sort|02|2}}\n|[[Billy Gunn]]\n|[[D-Generation X]]\n|{{sort|02|2}}\n|Test\n|-\n|{{sort|03|3}}\n|[[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]]\n|[[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]\n|{{sort|07|7}}\n|McMahon\n|-\n|{{sort|04|4}}\n|[[Test (wrestler)|Test]]\n|[[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]\n|{{sort|04|4}}\n|Kane\n|-\n|{{sort|05|5}}\n|[[X-Pac]]\n|[[D-Generation X]]\n|{{sort|06|6}}\n|Boss Man\n|-\n|{{sort|06|6}}\n|[[Road Dogg]]\n|[[D-Generation X]]\n|{{sort|03|3}}\n|Kane\n|-\n|{{sort|07|7}}\n|[[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]\n|[[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]\n|{{sort|05|5}}\n|Triple H\n|-\n|{{sort|08|8}}\n|[[Triple H]]\n|[[D-Generation X]]\n|{{sort|08|8}}\n|McMahon\n|-\n|{{sort|09|9}}\n|[[Mr. McMahon]]\n|[[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]\n|{{sort|09|9}}\n|Chyna\n|-\n|-style=\"background: gold\"\n|'''{{sort|10|10}}'''\n|'''[[Chyna]]'''\n|'''[[D-Generation X]]'''\n|'''{{sort|10|<nowiki>-</nowiki>}}'''\n|'''Winner'''\n|}\n{{note|KEN}} Shamrock jumped the top rope to attack Billy Gunn as he made his entrance.\n\n==Event==\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px; font-size:90%; margin-left:1em;\"\n!colspan=2 width=250|'''Other on-screen personnel'''\n|-\n|rowspan=3|English [[Sportscaster|commentators]]\n|[[Jerry Lawler]]\n|-\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]\n|-\n|[[Shane McMahon]] {{small|(Heat)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Hugo Savinovich]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Interviewer]]s\n|[[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Dok Hendrix]]\n|-\n|[[Kevin Kelly (announcer)|Kevin Kelly]] {{small|(Also commentator on Heat)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=1|[[Ring announcer]]\n|[[Howard Finkel]]\n|-\n|rowspan=5|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referee]]\n|[[Mike Chioda]]\n|-\n|[[Earl Hebner]]\n|-\n|[[Jim Korderas]]\n|-\n|[[Theodore Long]]\n|-\n|[[Tim White (wrestling)|Tim White]]\n|}\n\n===Preliminary matches===\nThe opening match began slowly, with Boss Man taunting Road Dogg and being met with a [[D-Generation X#Crotch chop|crotch chop]]. The two circled each other, occasionally going in for a grapple but without achieving a move. Eventually Road Dogg became trapped in the corner and Boss Man punched him. Road Dogg found some short success when Boss Man tried to [[Professional wrestling attacks#Body avalanche|run and jump onto him]], but was left with his crotch caught on the ropes. Boss Man tried to reply with his [[Club (weapon)#Law enforcement|night stick]] but referee [[Mike Chioda]] stopped him and while he was being reprimanded, Road Dogg dragged him to his feet and pulled him into the ring post, legs open. After recovering, Boss Man threw Road Dogg outside of the ring. Inside the ring Boss Man took to hurling his opponent into the turnbuckles and then crushing him with a [[bear hug]]. Despite some punching back from Road Dogg, Boss Man dominated most of the match from this point and despite a [[professional wrestling attacks#Punch|Shake, Rattle & Roll]] from Road Dogg, Boss Man used his opponent's momentum to catch him in the [[Powerslam#Spinning side slam|Boss Man Slam]], pinning him afterwards.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/jan25_rumble.html|title=McMahon wins Rumble, Rock champ again|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>\n\nWith Billy Gunn in the ring, Ken Shamrock ran into a series of kicks but managed to get to his feet and punch Gunn into the corner. He quickly worked on slowing down Gunn's style, keeping him mostly grounded with a series of kicks and [[Professional wrestling attacks#Elbow drop|elbow drops]], only picking Gunn up to kick him back down. Both men went down after Shamrock Irish-whipped him and tried to [[Professional wrestling throws#Flapjack|flapjack]] Gunn, only to have his face driven into the mat with a [[Leg drop#Leg drop bulldog|FameAsser]]. Although Gunn put Shamrock in the corner for a ten punch, he then went to run into him and was thrown over the top rope out of the ring. Shamrock took advantage of the time outside of the ring to drag Gunn around, throwing him face first into the ring post, steel steps and the unpadded floor before putting him back in the ring. When the two were on the apron, Gunn managed to stun Shamrock by elbowing him and jumping into a [[Professional wrestling throws#Bulldog|bulldog]] onto the Spanish announce table. Taking some time to recuperate, Shamrock was undeterred, fighting as soon as he returned to the ring as he began to work on Gunn's ankle. Gunn fought back but accidentally clotheslined referee Tim White and while he was down, Val Venis ran in and delivered a [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Spike DDT|DDT]] on Shamrock. By the time White was conscious to make a pin count, Shamrock kicked out. Gunn gained momentum and eventually went for a move from the turnbuckle. When he came down, Shamrock caught his ankle and took him to the ground, using his [[Professional wrestling holds#Ankle lock|ankle lock]] to make Gunn submit.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\"/>\n\n[[File:Sable in Manchester.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sable (wrestler)|Sable]] fought [[Luna Vachon]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|strap match]]]]\nThe European Championship match started with X-Pac running roughshod over Gangrel using a variety of [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spinning heel kick|spinning kicks]]. Gangrel's short advantage came from throwing X-Pac onto the ropes but X-Pac would not be kept down, trying a Bronco Buster. X-Pac tried to go to the top rope, fighting Gangrel from it, and then going for a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving crossbody|flying crossbody]]. Some controversy arose when referee [[Theodore Long|Teddy Long]] seemed to make the three count as Gangrel rolled the diving X-Pac into a roll-up pin, the champion kicking out too late. The match continued, though, despite chants from fans in attendance about the pin fall, but only for a short while as X-Pac jumped and drove a running Gangrel's head into the floor for the [[Facebuster#Sitout facebuster|X-Factor]] and pinning him.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\"/>\n\nDespite Shane McMahon announcing Sable as unfit for contest, she came to the ring and demanded to fight, with McMahon joining the commentary team and giving a very biased account. After whipping Vachon with the strap, Sable was knocked to the ground allowing Vachon to tap two turnbuckles but Sable stopped her, using the strap again to whip her. After being kicked in the corner by Sable, Vachon side slammed Sable and then wrapped the strap around Sable's neck, hoisting Sable on her back. She then toured the turnbuckles, tapping three of them unaware that Sable was doing the same from her back. Just before she could tap the fourth, Vachon was taken off her feet by Sable. Fearing a turn in the match, Shane McMahon jumped on the apron to distract the referee, but as Vachon went to tap the fourth turbuckle, [[Tori (wrestler)|Tori]] attacked her and ran back into the crowd, letting Sable freely tap the fourth turnbuckle in sight of the referee to retain the Women's Championship.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\"/>\n\n=== WWF Championship match===\nThe \"I Quit\" Match began with Mankind clotheslining and punching Rock into the turnbuckle before putting him on the ground and punching him, trying to make him quit early on with no success. When The Rock insulted Mankind over the microphone, Mankind struck him with the microphone and then [[Professional wrestling attacks#Cactus clothesline|Cactus clotheslined]] him out of the ring. After punching Rock against the barricade, he was thrown over the steel steps but managed to take control once again when The Rock joined the commentary team to further mock Mankind and was [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clotheslined]] over the table. After hitting him again with the microphone when he would not quit, Rock was thrown inside the ring again, where Mankind stuffed a smelly sock down the Rock's throat to the point where Rock could not talk to quit, as the Rock had passed out from the mandible claw. Mankind then took Rock out of the ring and through the crowd but when he tried to clothesline Rock, Rock slammed him back into the ringside barricade. Rock then took the bell to Mankind's head, ringing it next to his ear (and humorously singing \"bells will be ringing\" into the microphone) before trying to [[Powerslam#Side slam|Rock Bottom]] him through the Spanish announce table, but the table gave way before the move could be performed.\n\nMankind ran for recovery up the walkway but was chased by The Rock who lost control when his opponent began [[Professional wrestling attacks#Headbutt|head-butting]] him. Rock thumbed Mankind's eye and took him through the technical area, smashing his head into the food there and then performing a [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]] on him on the concrete, at which point Mankind refused to quit. Rock then brought a ladder into the match but was knocked down with the ladder on top of him, he escaped just as Mankind delivered a running [[Professional wrestling attacks#Elbow drop|elbow drop]] onto the ladder, though he would still not quit. Rock then set the ladder up and climbed to the first tier of crowd, fighting in front of them with Mankind just about to throw him off. Rock [[Professional wrestling attacks#Low blow|low blowed]] him though, and then climbed over the barrier up the stairs to make a running punch which launched Mankind onto the electrical hub of the arena, causing them to spark and the lights to go out briefly. Shane McMahon came to stop the match but Rock demanded his opponent quit, though he would not ask him the question as he kicked a crawling Mankind back towards the ring. With Mankind lying unconscious in the ring, Rock [[handcuffs|handcuffed]] his hands behind his back and hit his head into the turnbuckle. Mankind kicked the Rock low, then dropped a knee into his crotch and asked him if he quit. The Rock managed to stand up and clotheslined Mankind to the mat, putting a chair on his face and performing the [[Dwayne Johnson#In wrestling|Corporate Elbow]]. When he was asked if he would quit, Mankind told Rock to go to hell, Rock told him he'd go to hell first. Mankind stood up only to be met with three hard steel chair shots but still refused to quit, saying he'd have to be killed first. Rock then chased Mankind out of the ring and up the walkway, hitting him repeatedly with a chair until he fell unconscious on the concrete. Finally, Mankind was heard shouting \"I quit!\" three times in a row; the audio was actually a recording from a promo Mankind made on ''Heat'' in the match build up, so Mankind never actually quit, but the Rock was declared the winner nonetheless.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\"/> Backstage footage of before and after this match can be seen on the pro wrestling documentary ''[[Beyond the Mat]]''.\n\n===Royal Rumble match===\n[[File:Nelson Frazier, Jr. in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.jpg|thumb|left|[[Viscera (wrestler)|Mabel]] was kidnapped by [[The Ministry of Darkness]] in the Royal Rumble match]]\nThe Royal Rumble match began with Steve Austin and Vince McMahon circling each other. McMahon mistimed a clothesline and Austin punched him into the corner, [[professional wrestling attacks#Stomp|stomping a mudhole]]. Austin then went to throw McMahon over the top rope but stopped, wanting to take his time as [[John Tenta|Golga]] came to the ring. With Austin distracted by Golga, McMahon fled under the bottom rope (and thus wasn't eliminated) but Austin soon followed when Golga was eliminated. Austin followed McMahon through the crowd and eventually fought their way to the halls of the arena and was led into the [[washroom|public toilets]] where The Corporation were waiting to beat Austin down and leave him unconscious on the floor. In the ring [[Darren Drozdov|Droz]] had come out and waited the allotted time until [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] made his appearance, the two fighting only to quickly eliminate [[Gillberg (wrestler)|Gillberg]] as soon as he entered the ring. When [[Dan Severn]] entered the ring he immediately gunned for the also freshman [[Steve Blackman]], the two fighting in the corner until [[Tiger Ali Singh]] came in and attacked Blackman. Meanwhile, clips were shown of Austin being lifted onto a [[gurney]] and eventually being taken to hospital. Shortly after, [[The Blue Meanie]] entered the match and went after Singh, before being cornered by Droz. When the eleventh man was scheduled to enter, nobody showed and backstage Mabel was shown throwing [[Mosh (wrestler)|Headbanger Mosh]] into a wall before entering the Rumble himself in Mosh's place. Shortly after entering the match, Mabel took out Blackman, Severn, Singh, Meanie and Droz, and started a clash with [[Road Dogg]], who was just fresh and took Edge out, having the upper hand. But after having some dominance, the lights went out, and when they came back up, under a blue hue, [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] and [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] had eliminated Mabel and took him to meet [[The Undertaker]] who put him in a ([[kayfabe]]) trance. None of them were competitors. Road Dogg was left on his own and quickly eliminated [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]] but had more difficulty with [[Robert Maillet|Kurrgan]]. Al Snow tried to help Road Dogg but when he over zealously climbed the ropes to push Kurrgan out, Road Dogg jumped on the opportunity to push him over. The ring gradually began to fill up again with [[Goldust]] and [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|Godfather]] until [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]] entered, instantly putting all four wrestlers over the top rope and then eliminating himself when some asylum workers came to try and commit him.\n\nMr. McMahon briefly returned into the ring but then exited to give the ring to Ken Shamrock, opting to join the commentary team instead. The next entrant was Billy Gunn, with only one shoe due to his ankle being injured from their earlier match up. As [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] entered the ring, the Ministry were shown in the parking lot putting Mabel into a [[hearse]] and then an [[ambulance]] pulled up with Steve Austin driving. He quickly made his way to the ring, overshadowing the entrance of the Big Boss Man. McMahon ran around the ring away from Austin, running through it to allow Shamrock to secure him before fleeing again to the commentary team. Austin eliminated Shamrock with little trouble but put more effort into Boss Man, choking him with a turnbuckle tie. Again the ring began to fill up, with two members of DX in [[Triple H]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]], Test and Boss Man representing The Corporation along with other singles wrestlers in [[Val Venis]], [[Mark Henry]], [[Jeff Jarrett]], [[D'Lo Brown]] and [[Owen Hart]]. Austin took a break from being in the ring to go to the commentary team to throw a jug of water in McMahon's face before returning to the fight. At this point the first woman to enter a Royal Rumble, Chyna came to the ring. She instantly targeted Mark Henry, delivering forearms before throwing him over the top rope, but before she had time to celebrate Austin immediately clotheslined her over the top rope, for which Triple H attacked him, and in addition, this latter took both Val and Jarrett out. Triple H was soon eliminated by Austin as the numbers started to dwindle after Austin threw D'Lo and Owen over, and after giving a [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stone Cold Stunner]] to Boss Man, Austin eliminated him leaving only him and McMahon. Austin went to the announce table and attacked McMahon, throwing him into the crowd and then back to ringside, hitting him with a chair. Austin then threw McMahon into the ring, standing over him as McMahon clambered to his feet and lowblowed Austin. The two both staggered to their feet when Austin stunnered McMahon. The Rock then came to ringside taunting Austin with the WWF Championship, climbing up to the apron. As Austin ran to punch Rock, McMahon climbed to his feet and came up behind Austin, throwing him over the top rope and winning the 1999 Royal Rumble match.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Rockaustinxix.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] would meet [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] at [[WrestleMania]] for the first of three WrestleMania matches between the two over the next five years]]\nOn ''Raw Is War'' the following night, Mr. McMahon awarded The Rock the $100,000 bounty for helping him eliminate Austin in the Royal Rumble, and also announced that he was officially forfeiting his title shot at WrestleMania, the first time ever a Royal Rumble winner had done so, so as to not make The Rock defend his WWF Championship against McMahon. While McMahon planned to choose who The Rock would face at WrestleMania, he was interrupted by WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels, who informed McMahon that since he forfeited his title shot at WrestleMania, according to WWF rules, the title shot was then immediately given to the Royal Rumble runner-up, Steve Austin, much to McMahon's fury. Austin took advantage by convincing McMahon to a match. Austin explained that even more than a WWF Championship match, he wanted another chance to fight McMahon without any legal ramifications so much that he would risk his WrestleMania title shot for the chance. To ensure that there would be no Corporate interference, the match would take place inside a steel cage at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House]]. Austin went on to win the match after the debut of [[Paul Wight]], who came through the ring's mat and threw Austin into the cage wall, breaking it open and causing Austin to exit the cage before McMahon.<ref name=\"massacre\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/feb15_massacre.html|title=McMahon makes a Giant mistake|work=Slam!

Having been screwed again, Mankind hijacked the $100,000 bounty money The Rock earned for helping eliminate Austin, and began to throw it in the crowd, holding it ransom for a rematch. The rematch would be a twenty-minute time limit hardcore match, held in an empty arena during halftime of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] on ''[[WWE Heat|Halftime Heat]]'', where Mankind would win the title back by trapping Rock underneath a heavy payload on a [[forklift truck]]. With the Rock claiming it was an unfair win, the two faced each other again, and in hopes of finding a definitive champion the match was booked as a \"Last Man Standing\" match at St. Valentine's Day Massacre. It ended in a draw when both men were counted out,<ref name=\"massacre\"/> meaning they had to settle it again the next night on ''Raw is War'' in a [[ladder match]] which Rock won with help from [[Paul Wight]].<ref name=\"raw99\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/|title=Raw is War 1999 results|publisher=Obsessed With Wrestling|accessdate=2008-09-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607173232/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/|archivedate=2008-06-07}}</ref> With WrestleMania so close, Mankind sought to settle the score with Rock by countlessly trying to become a second special guest referee in the WrestleMania main event, alongside Wight.

Tori soon realized how selfish Sable was, though and the two had a match for the Women's Championship at WrestleMania XV where Sable retained her title thanks to interference from [[Nicole Bass]].<ref name=\"wm result\"/>\n\nMabel, meanwhile, was renamed Viscera and became the newest member of the Ministry of Darkness as it assembled its war against The Corporation and Mr. McMahon, making [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] part of the stable too on February 1.<ref name=\"raw99\"/> The Undertaker would have a \"Hell in a Cell\" match against Big Boss Man at WrestleMania XV which ended with The Brood passing rope from the roof to hang Boss Man with.<ref name=\"wm result\"/> The feud between the two stables continued until they joined forces when it became apparent that the \"higher power\" The Undertaker was answering to was actually Mr. McMahon.\n\nOne day after her historic appearance in the Royal Rumble Match, Chyna turned villainous by betraying Triple H and becoming the newest member of The Corporation. At St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the evil Chyna teamed with fellow Corporation member Kane in defeating Triple H and X-Pac. Chyna turned against Kane and reunited with Triple H at WrestleMania XV, but they would both help Shane McMahon defeat X-Pac later in the event, making Triple H a member of The Corporation.\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|results = <ref name=\"results\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881143/results/|title=Royal Rumble results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>\n|times = <ref name=\"PWH\"/>\n|dark1  = yes\n|match1 = [[Christian Cage|Christian]] defeated [[Jeff Hardy]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref name=\"PWH\"/>\n|time1  = 11:00\n|heat2  = yes\n|match2 = [[The J.O.B.

It took place on January 24, 1999, at the [[Honda Center|Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. The tagline and subtitle of the event was taken from a promise by [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] that the first entrant in the Royal Rumble, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], had \"no chance in hell\" of winning the match. The theme song for the event, based on the phrase, would go on to become the entrance music for McMahon's stable [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]] and later, just McMahon himself, which he uses to this day.\n\nThe [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] was the annual [[Royal Rumble match]], which saw the winner receive a title shot for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at the [[WrestleMania]] [[pay-per-view]] two months later. The Royal Rumble centered on the continuing [[Feud (professional wrestling)|heated rivalry]] between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Mr. McMahon, with those men entering the main event at #1 and #2, respectively. The penultimate match for the WWF Championship was an [[\"I Quit\" match]] between [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], which is remembered both for its brutality and its place in the documentary film ''[[Beyond the Mat]]''. Lower down on the card the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] and [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] were both defended.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe [[Royal Rumble]] is an annual [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] pay-per-view, produced every January by the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]], dubbed the \"Big Four\".<ref>Ian Hamilton. ''Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition'' (p. 160)</ref> It is named after the [[Royal Rumble match]], a modified [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world championship]] match at that year's WrestleMania. For 1999, the winner earned a match for the [[WWF Championship]] at [[WrestleMania XV]]. 1999 was the twelfth event in the Royal Rumble chronology.<ref name=wwematch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/royalrumble|title=Specialty Matches: Royal Rumble|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref><ref name=stats>{{cite web|last=Waldman|title=Statistical survival \u2013 breaking down the Royal Rumble|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/01/917194.html|first=Jon|publisher=SLAM!

The matches resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]], [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], or [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Tweener|less distinguishable characters]] to build tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, with storylines produced on their weekly television show, ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''.<ref name=\"HSW\">{{cite web|title=How Pro Wrestling Works|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm|last=Grabianowski|first=Ed|work=HowStuffWorks|publisher=[[Discovery Communications]]|accessdate=March 5, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LDla2zy5?url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm|archivedate=November 18, 2013}}</ref><ref name=WWEnt>{{cite web|title=Live & Televised Entertainment|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/company/events.jsp|publisher=WWE|accessdate=March 21, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5esskNFVE?url=http://corporate.wwe.com/company/events.jsp|archivedate=February 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe overriding theme of the pay-per-view was centered on [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]] and [[Vince McMahon#Mr. McMahon|Mr. McMahon's]] attempts to enforce his notions of how a company should be run on the promotion. Since its inception the night after [[Survivor Series (1999)|Survivor Series]], the group had mainly come to blows with [[D-Generation X]], the Undertaker's [[Ministry of Darkness]] and McMahon's nemesis [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]].\n\n[[File:Hbk.JPG|thumb|left|[[Shawn Michaels]] used his role as Commissioner to ruin [[Vince McMahon#Mr. McMahon|Mr. McMahon's]] attempts to enter the Royal Rumble at #30 twice]]\nWhen Commissioner [[Shawn Michaels]] allied himself with The Corporation, one of the first things he did was to book the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|Tag Team Champions]], [[Brian Gerard James|Road Dogg]] and [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]], in a title defense against Corporate members [[Ken Shamrock]] and [[Ray Traylor|The Big Boss Man]].

Filled with his typical rage Shamrock put his [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] on the line for a chance to honor his notions of sibling protection.\n\nAfter a minor absence, [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|Women's Champion]] [[Sable (wrestler)|Sable]] returned to Raw with an open invitation on December 28, but before the match a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Plant|fan]] came into the ring, later identified as [[Tori (wrestler)|Tori]] to give her a rose. A masked wrestler identified as \"Spider Lady\" came to the ring for the match (a nod to [[The Fabulous Moolah]]'s [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Screwjob|screwjob]] over [[Wendi Richter]] in the mid '80s) but it ended in a no-contest when she started whipping Sable with her belt. The masked woman was revealed to be [[Luna Vachon]], who would go on to face Sable in a \"Strap Match\" at the Rumble.\n\nThe Rock and Mankind had been feuding ever since [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]] in November 1998, when the two met in the finals of the \"Deadly Game\" tournament for the vacant [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]]. The Rock won the title that night with the help of the McMahons, who had previously been assisting Mankind, and became the chosen Corporate Champion while Mankind began a feud with the Corporation. Mankind faced The Rock again at Rock Bottom: IYH and won the match, but Mr. McMahon stepped in and announced that while Rock lost the match by falling unconscious to the [[mandible claw]], he did not technically submit and thus the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] would not change hands.<ref name=\"slam bottom\"/> Angered at being screwed out of the championship twice, Mankind attacked [[Shane McMahon]] on Raw is War and demanded a match. On the first Raw is War of 1999, January 4, after interference from The Corporation, D-Generation X and Steve Austin, Mankind won his first WWF Championship.<ref name=\"rawmick\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/listthis/greatrawmoments/rawmoments8|title=Mankind wins WWE Championship|last=Robinson|first=Bryan|date=2007-12-03|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref><ref name=\"mick1\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/jan5_foleywin.html|title=Mick Foley wins WWF World Title, dedicates match to his children|work=Slam!

On Raw is War on January 11, a Corporation vs. DX mini-Rumble was set up with the winner taking the coveted number 30 spot; after all the apparent competitors had entered it seemed as if [[Triple H]] had won until Mr. McMahon made his way to the ring, entering himself on behalf of the Corporation and throwing a distracted Triple H out of the ring. Again it seemed as if the winner was established until DX's [[Chyna]] made her way to the ring and won the match.<ref name=\"jan16\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/jan16_man.html|title=Mankind lets The Rock know what's cookin'|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> The event would mark the first time a female wrestler took part in the match. Chyna also appeared at the Royal Rumble the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|following year]] as well. Chyna became the only woman to enter the match until [[Beth Phoenix]] entered the Royal Rumble in [[Royal Rumble (2010)|2010]], and Nia Jax in the 2019 Royal Rumble.\n\nThe most notable aspect of the Royal Rumble, though, was the feud between Mr. McMahon and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Austin had won the Royal Rumble the previous two years and McMahon attempted to prevent him from repeating by putting him in a \"Buried Alive\" match at Rock Bottom: IYH against [[The Undertaker]] with one Royal Rumble place on the line. Austin won, with a little help from [[Glenn Jacobs|Kane]] and was guaranteed a place in the match, but McMahon continued in his attempts to prevent Austin from winning the match by \"randomly\" drawing Austin's spot at #1 and entering himself in the match at #30. Commissioner Michaels over-rode his decision and put McMahon at #2, and set up the aforementioned Corporate/DX mini-Rumble for the now vacant #30 position. With Austin and McMahon being the first two to enter, McMahon wanted to guarantee there would be \"no chance in hell\" that Austin would win by not only training as a competitor, but also offering a $100,000 [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] for the man who eliminated him.\n\n===Qualifying matches===\n*[[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] defeated [[The Undertaker]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Buried Alive match]] at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]<ref name=\"slam bottom\"/>\n*[[Chyna]] won a Corporation vs. DX \"Corporate Rumble\" for the #30 spot on the January 11, 1999 edition of ''Raw Is War''<ref name=\"jan16\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Draw\n!Entrant\n!Faction\n!Order\n!Eliminated by\n|-\n|{{sort|01|1}}\n|[[Ken Shamrock]]\n|[[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]\n|{{sort|01|1}}\n|Himself{{Ref|KEN}}\n|-\n|{{sort|02|2}}\n|[[Billy Gunn]]\n|[[D-Generation X]]\n|{{sort|02|2}}\n|Test\n|-\n|{{sort|03|3}}\n|[[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]]\n|[[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]\n|{{sort|07|7}}\n|McMahon\n|-\n|{{sort|04|4}}\n|[[Test (wrestler)|Test]]\n|[[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]\n|{{sort|04|4}}\n|Kane\n|-\n|{{sort|05|5}}\n|[[X-Pac]]\n|[[D-Generation X]]\n|{{sort|06|6}}\n|Boss Man\n|-\n|{{sort|06|6}}\n|[[Road Dogg]]\n|[[D-Generation X]]\n|{{sort|03|3}}\n|Kane\n|-\n|{{sort|07|7}}\n|[[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]\n|[[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]\n|{{sort|05|5}}\n|Triple H\n|-\n|{{sort|08|8}}\n|[[Triple H]]\n|[[D-Generation X]]\n|{{sort|08|8}}\n|McMahon\n|-\n|{{sort|09|9}}\n|[[Mr. McMahon]]\n|[[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]\n|{{sort|09|9}}\n|Chyna\n|-\n|-style=\"background: gold\"\n|'''{{sort|10|10}}'''\n|'''[[Chyna]]'''\n|'''[[D-Generation X]]'''\n|'''{{sort|10|<nowiki>-</nowiki>}}'''\n|'''Winner'''\n|}\n{{note|KEN}} Shamrock jumped the top rope to attack Billy Gunn as he made his entrance.\n\n==Event==\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px; font-size:90%; margin-left:1em;\"\n!colspan=2 width=250|'''Other on-screen personnel'''\n|-\n|rowspan=3|English [[Sportscaster|commentators]]\n|[[Jerry Lawler]]\n|-\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]\n|-\n|[[Shane McMahon]] {{small|(Heat)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Hugo Savinovich]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Interviewer]]s\n|[[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Dok Hendrix]]\n|-\n|[[Kevin Kelly (announcer)|Kevin Kelly]] {{small|(Also commentator on Heat)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=1|[[Ring announcer]]\n|[[Howard Finkel]]\n|-\n|rowspan=5|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referee]]\n|[[Mike Chioda]]\n|-\n|[[Earl Hebner]]\n|-\n|[[Jim Korderas]]\n|-\n|[[Theodore Long]]\n|-\n|[[Tim White (wrestling)|Tim White]]\n|}\n\n===Preliminary matches===\nThe opening match began slowly, with Boss Man taunting Road Dogg and being met with a [[D-Generation X#Crotch chop|crotch chop]]. The two circled each other, occasionally going in for a grapple but without achieving a move. Eventually Road Dogg became trapped in the corner and Boss Man punched him. Road Dogg found some short success when Boss Man tried to [[Professional wrestling attacks#Body avalanche|run and jump onto him]], but was left with his crotch caught on the ropes. Boss Man tried to reply with his [[Club (weapon)#Law enforcement|night stick]] but referee [[Mike Chioda]] stopped him and while he was being reprimanded, Road Dogg dragged him to his feet and pulled him into the ring post, legs open. After recovering, Boss Man threw Road Dogg outside of the ring. Inside the ring Boss Man took to hurling his opponent into the turnbuckles and then crushing him with a [[bear hug]]. Despite some punching back from Road Dogg, Boss Man dominated most of the match from this point and despite a [[professional wrestling attacks#Punch|Shake, Rattle & Roll]] from Road Dogg, Boss Man used his opponent's momentum to catch him in the [[Powerslam#Spinning side slam|Boss Man Slam]], pinning him afterwards.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/jan25_rumble.html|title=McMahon wins Rumble, Rock champ again|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>\n\nWith Billy Gunn in the ring, Ken Shamrock ran into a series of kicks but managed to get to his feet and punch Gunn into the corner. He quickly worked on slowing down Gunn's style, keeping him mostly grounded with a series of kicks and [[Professional wrestling attacks#Elbow drop|elbow drops]], only picking Gunn up to kick him back down. Both men went down after Shamrock Irish-whipped him and tried to [[Professional wrestling throws#Flapjack|flapjack]] Gunn, only to have his face driven into the mat with a [[Leg drop#Leg drop bulldog|FameAsser]]. Although Gunn put Shamrock in the corner for a ten punch, he then went to run into him and was thrown over the top rope out of the ring. Shamrock took advantage of the time outside of the ring to drag Gunn around, throwing him face first into the ring post, steel steps and the unpadded floor before putting him back in the ring. When the two were on the apron, Gunn managed to stun Shamrock by elbowing him and jumping into a [[Professional wrestling throws#Bulldog|bulldog]] onto the Spanish announce table. Taking some time to recuperate, Shamrock was undeterred, fighting as soon as he returned to the ring as he began to work on Gunn's ankle. Gunn fought back but accidentally clotheslined referee Tim White and while he was down, Val Venis ran in and delivered a [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Spike DDT|DDT]] on Shamrock. By the time White was conscious to make a pin count, Shamrock kicked out. Gunn gained momentum and eventually went for a move from the turnbuckle. When he came down, Shamrock caught his ankle and took him to the ground, using his [[Professional wrestling holds#Ankle lock|ankle lock]] to make Gunn submit.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\"/>\n\n[[File:Sable in Manchester.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sable (wrestler)|Sable]] fought [[Luna Vachon]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|strap match]]]]\nThe European Championship match started with X-Pac running roughshod over Gangrel using a variety of [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spinning heel kick|spinning kicks]]. Gangrel's short advantage came from throwing X-Pac onto the ropes but X-Pac would not be kept down, trying a Bronco Buster. X-Pac tried to go to the top rope, fighting Gangrel from it, and then going for a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving crossbody|flying crossbody]]. Some controversy arose when referee [[Theodore Long|Teddy Long]] seemed to make the three count as Gangrel rolled the diving X-Pac into a roll-up pin, the champion kicking out too late. The match continued, though, despite chants from fans in attendance about the pin fall, but only for a short while as X-Pac jumped and drove a running Gangrel's head into the floor for the [[Facebuster#Sitout facebuster|X-Factor]] and pinning him.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\"/>\n\nDespite Shane McMahon announcing Sable as unfit for contest, she came to the ring and demanded to fight, with McMahon joining the commentary team and giving a very biased account. After whipping Vachon with the strap, Sable was knocked to the ground allowing Vachon to tap two turnbuckles but Sable stopped her, using the strap again to whip her. After being kicked in the corner by Sable, Vachon side slammed Sable and then wrapped the strap around Sable's neck, hoisting Sable on her back. She then toured the turnbuckles, tapping three of them unaware that Sable was doing the same from her back. Just before she could tap the fourth, Vachon was taken off her feet by Sable. Fearing a turn in the match, Shane McMahon jumped on the apron to distract the referee, but as Vachon went to tap the fourth turbuckle, [[Tori (wrestler)|Tori]] attacked her and ran back into the crowd, letting Sable freely tap the fourth turnbuckle in sight of the referee to retain the Women's Championship.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\"/>\n\n=== WWF Championship match===\nThe \"I Quit\" Match began with Mankind clotheslining and punching Rock into the turnbuckle before putting him on the ground and punching him, trying to make him quit early on with no success. When The Rock insulted Mankind over the microphone, Mankind struck him with the microphone and then [[Professional wrestling attacks#Cactus clothesline|Cactus clotheslined]] him out of the ring. After punching Rock against the barricade, he was thrown over the steel steps but managed to take control once again when The Rock joined the commentary team to further mock Mankind and was [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clotheslined]] over the table. After hitting him again with the microphone when he would not quit, Rock was thrown inside the ring again, where Mankind stuffed a smelly sock down the Rock's throat to the point where Rock could not talk to quit, as the Rock had passed out from the mandible claw. Mankind then took Rock out of the ring and through the crowd but when he tried to clothesline Rock, Rock slammed him back into the ringside barricade. Rock then took the bell to Mankind's head, ringing it next to his ear (and humorously singing \"bells will be ringing\" into the microphone) before trying to [[Powerslam#Side slam|Rock Bottom]] him through the Spanish announce table, but the table gave way before the move could be performed.\n\nMankind ran for recovery up the walkway but was chased by The Rock who lost control when his opponent began [[Professional wrestling attacks#Headbutt|head-butting]] him. Rock thumbed Mankind's eye and took him through the technical area, smashing his head into the food there and then performing a [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]] on him on the concrete, at which point Mankind refused to quit. Rock then brought a ladder into the match but was knocked down with the ladder on top of him, he escaped just as Mankind delivered a running [[Professional wrestling attacks#Elbow drop|elbow drop]] onto the ladder, though he would still not quit. Rock then set the ladder up and climbed to the first tier of crowd, fighting in front of them with Mankind just about to throw him off. Rock [[Professional wrestling attacks#Low blow|low blowed]] him though, and then climbed over the barrier up the stairs to make a running punch which launched Mankind onto the electrical hub of the arena, causing them to spark and the lights to go out briefly. Shane McMahon came to stop the match but Rock demanded his opponent quit, though he would not ask him the question as he kicked a crawling Mankind back towards the ring. With Mankind lying unconscious in the ring, Rock [[handcuffs|handcuffed]] his hands behind his back and hit his head into the turnbuckle. Mankind kicked the Rock low, then dropped a knee into his crotch and asked him if he quit. The Rock managed to stand up and clotheslined Mankind to the mat, putting a chair on his face and performing the [[Dwayne Johnson#In wrestling|Corporate Elbow]]. When he was asked if he would quit, Mankind told Rock to go to hell, Rock told him he'd go to hell first. Mankind stood up only to be met with three hard steel chair shots but still refused to quit, saying he'd have to be killed first. Rock then chased Mankind out of the ring and up the walkway, hitting him repeatedly with a chair until he fell unconscious on the concrete. Finally, Mankind was heard shouting \"I quit!\" three times in a row; the audio was actually a recording from a promo Mankind made on ''Heat'' in the match build up, so Mankind never actually quit, but the Rock was declared the winner nonetheless.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\"/> Backstage footage of before and after this match can be seen on the pro wrestling documentary ''[[Beyond the Mat]]''.\n\n===Royal Rumble match===\n[[File:Nelson Frazier, Jr. in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.jpg|thumb|left|[[Viscera (wrestler)|Mabel]] was kidnapped by [[The Ministry of Darkness]] in the Royal Rumble match]]\nThe Royal Rumble match began with Steve Austin and Vince McMahon circling each other. McMahon mistimed a clothesline and Austin punched him into the corner, [[professional wrestling attacks#Stomp|stomping a mudhole]]. Austin then went to throw McMahon over the top rope but stopped, wanting to take his time as [[John Tenta|Golga]] came to the ring. With Austin distracted by Golga, McMahon fled under the bottom rope (and thus wasn't eliminated) but Austin soon followed when Golga was eliminated. Austin followed McMahon through the crowd and eventually fought their way to the halls of the arena and was led into the [[washroom|public toilets]] where The Corporation were waiting to beat Austin down and leave him unconscious on the floor. In the ring [[Darren Drozdov|Droz]] had come out and waited the allotted time until [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] made his appearance, the two fighting only to quickly eliminate [[Gillberg (wrestler)|Gillberg]] as soon as he entered the ring. When [[Dan Severn]] entered the ring he immediately gunned for the also freshman [[Steve Blackman]], the two fighting in the corner until [[Tiger Ali Singh]] came in and attacked Blackman. Meanwhile, clips were shown of Austin being lifted onto a [[gurney]] and eventually being taken to hospital. Shortly after, [[The Blue Meanie]] entered the match and went after Singh, before being cornered by Droz. When the eleventh man was scheduled to enter, nobody showed and backstage Mabel was shown throwing [[Mosh (wrestler)|Headbanger Mosh]] into a wall before entering the Rumble himself in Mosh's place. Shortly after entering the match, Mabel took out Blackman, Severn, Singh, Meanie and Droz, and started a clash with [[Road Dogg]], who was just fresh and took Edge out, having the upper hand. But after having some dominance, the lights went out, and when they came back up, under a blue hue, [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] and [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] had eliminated Mabel and took him to meet [[The Undertaker]] who put him in a ([[kayfabe]]) trance. None of them were competitors. Road Dogg was left on his own and quickly eliminated [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]] but had more difficulty with [[Robert Maillet|Kurrgan]]. Al Snow tried to help Road Dogg but when he over zealously climbed the ropes to push Kurrgan out, Road Dogg jumped on the opportunity to push him over. The ring gradually began to fill up again with [[Goldust]] and [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|Godfather]] until [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]] entered, instantly putting all four wrestlers over the top rope and then eliminating himself when some asylum workers came to try and commit him.\n\nMr. McMahon briefly returned into the ring but then exited to give the ring to Ken Shamrock, opting to join the commentary team instead. The next entrant was Billy Gunn, with only one shoe due to his ankle being injured from their earlier match up. As [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] entered the ring, the Ministry were shown in the parking lot putting Mabel into a [[hearse]] and then an [[ambulance]] pulled up with Steve Austin driving. He quickly made his way to the ring, overshadowing the entrance of the Big Boss Man. McMahon ran around the ring away from Austin, running through it to allow Shamrock to secure him before fleeing again to the commentary team. Austin eliminated Shamrock with little trouble but put more effort into Boss Man, choking him with a turnbuckle tie. Again the ring began to fill up, with two members of DX in [[Triple H]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]], Test and Boss Man representing The Corporation along with other singles wrestlers in [[Val Venis]], [[Mark Henry]], [[Jeff Jarrett]], [[D'Lo Brown]] and [[Owen Hart]]. Austin took a break from being in the ring to go to the commentary team to throw a jug of water in McMahon's face before returning to the fight. At this point the first woman to enter a Royal Rumble, Chyna came to the ring. She instantly targeted Mark Henry, delivering forearms before throwing him over the top rope, but before she had time to celebrate Austin immediately clotheslined her over the top rope, for which Triple H attacked him, and in addition, this latter took both Val and Jarrett out. Triple H was soon eliminated by Austin as the numbers started to dwindle after Austin threw D'Lo and Owen over, and after giving a [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stone Cold Stunner]] to Boss Man, Austin eliminated him leaving only him and McMahon. Austin went to the announce table and attacked McMahon, throwing him into the crowd and then back to ringside, hitting him with a chair. Austin then threw McMahon into the ring, standing over him as McMahon clambered to his feet and lowblowed Austin. The two both staggered to their feet when Austin stunnered McMahon. The Rock then came to ringside taunting Austin with the WWF Championship, climbing up to the apron. As Austin ran to punch Rock, McMahon climbed to his feet and came up behind Austin, throwing him over the top rope and winning the 1999 Royal Rumble match.<ref name=\"results\"/><ref name=\"slam review\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Rockaustinxix.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] would meet [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] at [[WrestleMania]] for the first of three WrestleMania matches between the two over the next five years]]\nOn ''Raw Is War'' the following night, Mr. McMahon awarded The Rock the $100,000 bounty for helping him eliminate Austin in the Royal Rumble, and also announced that he was officially forfeiting his title shot at WrestleMania, the first time ever a Royal Rumble winner had done so, so as to not make The Rock defend his WWF Championship against McMahon. While McMahon planned to choose who The Rock would face at WrestleMania, he was interrupted by WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels, who informed McMahon that since he forfeited his title shot at WrestleMania, according to WWF rules, the title shot was then immediately given to the Royal Rumble runner-up, Steve Austin, much to McMahon's fury. Austin took advantage by convincing McMahon to a match. Austin explained that even more than a WWF Championship match, he wanted another chance to fight McMahon without any legal ramifications so much that he would risk his WrestleMania title shot for the chance. To ensure that there would be no Corporate interference, the match would take place inside a steel cage at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House]]. Austin went on to win the match after the debut of [[Paul Wight]], who came through the ring's mat and threw Austin into the cage wall, breaking it open and causing Austin to exit the cage before McMahon.<ref name=\"massacre\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/feb15_massacre.html|title=McMahon makes a Giant mistake|work=Slam!

Having been screwed again, Mankind hijacked the $100,000 bounty money The Rock earned for helping eliminate Austin, and began to throw it in the crowd, holding it ransom for a rematch. The rematch would be a twenty-minute time limit hardcore match, held in an empty arena during halftime of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] on ''[[WWE Heat|Halftime Heat]]'', where Mankind would win the title back by trapping Rock underneath a heavy payload on a [[forklift truck]]. With the Rock claiming it was an unfair win, the two faced each other again, and in hopes of finding a definitive champion the match was booked as a \"Last Man Standing\" match at St. Valentine's Day Massacre. It ended in a draw when both men were counted out,<ref name=\"massacre\"/> meaning they had to settle it again the next night on ''Raw is War'' in a [[ladder match]] which Rock won with help from [[Paul Wight]].<ref name=\"raw99\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/|title=Raw is War 1999 results|publisher=Obsessed With Wrestling|accessdate=2008-09-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607173232/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/|archivedate=2008-06-07}}</ref> With WrestleMania so close, Mankind sought to settle the score with Rock by countlessly trying to become a second special guest referee in the WrestleMania main event, alongside Wight. Early in the WrestleMania card, Wight and Mankind fought for the referee position in a match which saw Wight disqualified for chokeslamming Mankind through a pair of steel folding chairs.<ref name=\"wm result\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm15/results/|title=WrestleMania XV Results|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> Mankind was sent to the hospital for his injuries, but returned to officiate in the closing minutes of the match.\n\nAfter making herself properly known, Sable's stalker Tori would be humiliated with her, pretending to align herself with Luna Vachon only to help Sable give her a beat down. Tori soon realized how selfish Sable was, though and the two had a match for the Women's Championship at WrestleMania XV where Sable retained her title thanks to interference from [[Nicole Bass]].<ref name=\"wm result\"/>\n\nMabel, meanwhile, was renamed Viscera and became the newest member of the Ministry of Darkness as it assembled its war against The Corporation and Mr. McMahon, making [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] part of the stable too on February 1.<ref name=\"raw99\"/> The Undertaker would have a \"Hell in a Cell\" match against Big Boss Man at WrestleMania XV which ended with The Brood passing rope from the roof to hang Boss Man with.<ref name=\"wm result\"/> The feud between the two stables continued until they joined forces when it became apparent that the \"higher power\" The Undertaker was answering to was actually Mr. McMahon.\n\nOne day after her historic appearance in the Royal Rumble Match, Chyna turned villainous by betraying Triple H and becoming the newest member of The Corporation. At St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the evil Chyna teamed with fellow Corporation member Kane in defeating Triple H and X-Pac. Chyna turned against Kane and reunited with Triple H at WrestleMania XV, but they would both help Shane McMahon defeat X-Pac later in the event, making Triple H a member of The Corporation.\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|results = <ref name=\"results\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881143/results/|title=Royal Rumble results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>\n|times = <ref name=\"PWH\"/>\n|dark1  = yes\n|match1 = [[Christian Cage|Christian]] defeated [[Jeff Hardy]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref name=\"PWH\"/>\n|time1  = 11:00\n|heat2  = yes\n|match2 = [[The J.O.B.
