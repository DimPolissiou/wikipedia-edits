It consists of two parts - [[Kwai Chung]] and [[Tsing Yi Island]]. Kwai Tsing is part of the [[New Territories]]. It had a population of 520 572 in 2016. <ref>[https://www.bycensus2016.gov.hk/en/bc-mt.html 2016 HK By-Census Population result Retrieved 2018-05-23]</ref>The district has the third least educated residents and their income is below average.\n\nKwai Tsing did not exist as a standalone district when Hong Kong's [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Board]]s were formed in the early 1980s. It remained as a part of [[Tsuen Wan District|Tsuen Wan]] district until 1985. The newly created district was known as '''Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi District''' (\u8475\u6d8c\u53ca\u9752\u8863\u5340) until 1988, when its name was shortened to '''Kwai Tsing District'''.\n\nThe internationally famous [[container terminal]]s can be found within the district, along the shores of [[Rambler Channel]] between Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi Island.  The [[Tsing Ma Bridge]], leading to the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] through the [[North Lantau Highway]], starts at the northwestern end of Tsing Yi Island.\n\nOver 75% of the district residents live in [[public housing]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\nIn 1669, the [[Qing dynasty]] forced the people in Hong Kong and the coastal regions such as [[Guangdong]], Guangxi, Fujian, etc., to move to the inland areas of mainland China. After this move inland policy ceased,   a large number of Hakka people from the [[Huayang, Wuhua County|Huayang region]] of Guangdong province, as well as the Hakka districts of Fujian province, moved to what is now Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Traditionally, Kwai Tsing District has been a Hakka speaking region; the original inhabitants of the villages in this area were mainly of Hakka  extraction.\n\n==Geography==\nKwai Tsing District borders in the north and west with [[Tsuen Wan District]], east with [[Sha Tin District]], southeast with [[Sham Shui Po District]] and [[Yau Tsim Mong District]] (marine), south with [[Central and Western District]] (marine), and southwest with [[Islands District]] (marine).\n\n==Constituencies==\n[[File:Kwai Tsing District Council Election 2003.png|thumb|400px|right|Constituencies in 2003 District Council Election.]]\n\n===2003===\nBy 2003 District Councils Election, the Kwai Tsing [[District Council of Hong Kong|District Council]] is divided into 28 constituencies:\n\n'''Kwai Chung''' \n*[[Cho Yiu]]\n*[[Kwai Chung Estate]]\n*[[Kwai Fong]]\n*[[Kwai Hing]]\n*[[Kwai Shing East Estate]]\n*[[Kwai Shing West Estate]]\n*[[Hing Fong]]\n*[[Lai King]]\n*[[Lai Wah]]\n*[[Lai Yiu]]\n*[[On Yam]]\n*[[Shek Lei]]\n*[[Shek Lei]] Extension\n*[[Shek Yam]]\n*[[Tai Pak Tin]]\n*Upper [[Tai Wo Hau]]\n*Lower [[Tai Wo Hau]]\n\n'''Tsing Yi'''\n*[[Cheung Ching Estate|Cheung Ching]]\n*[[Cheung Hang Estate|Cheung Hang]]\n*[[Cheung Hong Estate|Cheung Hong]]\n*[[Cheung On Estate|Cheung On]]\n*[[Ching Fat]]\n*[[Greenfield Garden|Greenfield]]\n*[[On Ho]]\n*[[Shing Hong]]\n*[[Tsing Yi Estate]]\n*[[Tsing Yi South]]\n*[[Wai Ying]]\n\n===2015===\nIt has 29 constituencies in 2015 election. <ref>[https://www.elections.gov.hk/dc2015/eng/results_kwai_tsing.html?1527693084318 2015 District Council Election - Kwai Ching, 2015-11-23 Retrieved 2018-05-30]</ref>\n\n*S01 Kwai Hing\n*S02 Kwai Shing East Estate\n*S03 Upper Tai Wo Hau\n*S04 Lower Tai Wo Hau\n*S05 Kwai Chung Estate North\n*S06 Kwai Chung Estate South\n*S07 Shek Yam\n*S08 On Yam\n*S09 Shek Lei South\n*S10 Shek Lei North\n*S11 Tai Pak Tin\n*S12 Kwai Fong\n*S13 Wah Lai\n*S14 Lai Wah\n*S15 Cho Yiu\n*S16 Hing Fong\n*S17 Lai King\n*S18 Kwai Shing West Estate\n*S19 On Ho\n*S20 Wai Ying\n*S21 Tsing Yi Estate\n*S22 Greenfield\n*S23 Cheung Ching\n*S24 Cheung Hong\n*S25 Shing Hong\n*S26 Tsing Yi South\n*S27 Cheung Hang\n*S28 Ching Fat\n*S29 Cheung On\n\n==Town centre==\nThe district is part of [[Tsuen Wan New Town]].  Unlike other new towns in Hong Kong, the district has no clear town core in the course of development.  Cores emerge only after [[Metroplaza]] in [[Kwai Fong]] and [[Maritime Square]] in [[Tsing Yi]] was built, but they are still incomparable to their counterparts in other new towns in Hong Kong.\n\n==Industry==\nIndustry is an integral part of the district.  Both light and heavy industries share substantial land in the district.\n\n==Education==\nLike other early new towns of Hong Kong, the district was primary for settling the influx of Chinese population around the year of the change of sovereignty in China in 1949 and the [[baby boom]] afterwards.  Public housing estates were built throughout the district.  Many schools have been established by various charities and religious organisations. Some have provided vocational training for industries in Hong Kong while some have become liberal schools.

It consists of two parts - [[Kwai Chung]] and [[Tsing Yi Island]]. Kwai Tsing is part of the [[New Territories]]. It had a population of 520 572 in 2016. <ref>[https://www.bycensus2016.gov.hk/en/bc-mt.html 2016 HK By-Census Population result Retrieved 2018-05-23]</ref>The district has the third least educated residents and their income is below average.\n\nKwai Tsing did not exist as a standalone district when Hong Kong's [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Board]]s were formed in the early 1980s. It remained as a part of [[Tsuen Wan District|Tsuen Wan]] district until 1985. The newly created district was known as '''Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi District''' (\u8475\u6d8c\u53ca\u9752\u8863\u5340) until 1988, when its name was shortened to '''Kwai Tsing District'''.\n\nThe internationally famous [[container terminal]]s can be found within the district, along the shores of [[Rambler Channel]] between Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi Island.  The [[Tsing Ma Bridge]], leading to the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] through the [[North Lantau Highway]], starts at the northwestern end of Tsing Yi Island.\n\nOver 75% of the district residents live in [[public housing]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\nIn 1669, the [[Qing dynasty]] forced the people in Hong Kong and the coastal regions such as [[Guangdong]], Guangxi, Fujian, etc., to move to the inland areas of mainland China. After this move inland policy ceased,   a large number of Hakka people from the [[Huayang, Wuhua County|Huayang region]] of Guangdong province, as well as the Hakka districts of Fujian province, moved to what is now Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Traditionally, Kwai Tsing District has been a Hakka speaking region; the original inhabitants of the villages in this area were mainly of Hakka  extraction.\n\n==Geography==\nKwai Tsing District borders in the north and west with [[Tsuen Wan District]], east with [[Sha Tin District]], southeast with [[Sham Shui Po District]] and [[Yau Tsim Mong District]] (marine), south with [[Central and Western District]] (marine), and southwest with [[Islands District]] (marine).\n\n==Constituencies==\n[[File:Kwai Tsing District Council Election 2003.png|thumb|400px|right|Constituencies in 2003 District Council Election.]]\n\n===2003===\nBy 2003 District Councils Election, the Kwai Tsing [[District Council of Hong Kong|District Council]] is divided into 28 constituencies:\n\n'''Kwai Chung''' \n*[[Cho Yiu]]\n*[[Kwai Chung Estate]]\n*[[Kwai Fong]]\n*[[Kwai Hing]]\n*[[Kwai Shing East Estate]]\n*[[Kwai Shing West Estate]]\n*[[Hing Fong]]\n*[[Lai King]]\n*[[Lai Wah]]\n*[[Lai Yiu]]\n*[[On Yam]]\n*[[Shek Lei]]\n*[[Shek Lei]] Extension\n*[[Shek Yam]]\n*[[Tai Pak Tin]]\n*Upper [[Tai Wo Hau]]\n*Lower [[Tai Wo Hau]]\n\n'''Tsing Yi'''\n*[[Cheung Ching Estate|Cheung Ching]]\n*[[Cheung Hang Estate|Cheung Hang]]\n*[[Cheung Hong Estate|Cheung Hong]]\n*[[Cheung On Estate|Cheung On]]\n*[[Ching Fat]]\n*[[Greenfield Garden|Greenfield]]\n*[[On Ho]]\n*[[Shing Hong]]\n*[[Tsing Yi Estate]]\n*[[Tsing Yi South]]\n*[[Wai Ying]]\n\n===2015===\nIt has 29 constituencies in 2015 election. <ref>[https://www.elections.gov.hk/dc2015/eng/results_kwai_tsing.html?1527693084318 2015 District Council Election - Kwai Ching, 2015-11-23 Retrieved 2018-05-30]</ref>\n\n*S01 Kwai Hing\n*S02 Kwai Shing East Estate\n*S03 Upper Tai Wo Hau\n*S04 Lower Tai Wo Hau\n*S05 Kwai Chung Estate North\n*S06 Kwai Chung Estate South\n*S07 Shek Yam\n*S08 On Yam\n*S09 Shek Lei South\n*S10 Shek Lei North\n*S11 Tai Pak Tin\n*S12 Kwai Fong\n*S13 Wah Lai\n*S14 Lai Wah\n*S15 Cho Yiu\n*S16 Hing Fong\n*S17 Lai King\n*S18 Kwai Shing West Estate\n*S19 On Ho\n*S20 Wai Ying\n*S21 Tsing Yi Estate\n*S22 Greenfield\n*S23 Cheung Ching\n*S24 Cheung Hong\n*S25 Shing Hong\n*S26 Tsing Yi South\n*S27 Cheung Hang\n*S28 Ching Fat\n*S29 Cheung On\n\n==Town centre==\nThe district is part of [[Tsuen Wan New Town]].  Unlike other new towns in Hong Kong, the district has no clear town core in the course of development.  Cores emerge only after [[Metroplaza]] in [[Kwai Fong]] and [[Maritime Square]] in [[Tsing Yi]] was built, but they are still incomparable to their counterparts in other new towns in Hong Kong.\n\n==Industry==\nIndustry is an integral part of the district.  Both light and heavy industries share substantial land in the district.\n\n==Education==\nLike other early new towns of Hong Kong, the district was primary for settling the influx of Chinese population around the year of the change of sovereignty in China in 1949 and the [[baby boom]] afterwards.  Public housing estates were built throughout the district.  Many schools have been established by various charities and religious organisations. Some have provided vocational training for industries in Hong Kong while some have become liberal schools. As the community has aged, the number of school children declined after the 2000s, and schools are facing survival problems.\n\nSecondary schools in 2006:\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Buddhist Sin Tak College]]\n*[[Buddhist Yip Kei Nam Memorial College]]\n*[[Caritas St. Joseph Secondary School]]\n*[[Carmel Alison Lam Foundation Secondary School]]\n*[[CCC Chuen Yuen College]]\n*[[CCC Yenching College]]\n*[[CNEC Christian College]]\n*[[CNEC Lee I Yao Memorial Secondary School]]\n*[[Cotton Spinners Association Secondary School]]\n*[[Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Siu Ming Catholic Secondary School]]\n*[[Ha Kwai Chung Government Secondary School]]\n*[[HKSYC & IA Chan Nam Chong Memorial College]]\n*[[Hong Kong Taoist Association the Yuen Yuen Institute No.1 Secondary School]]\n*[[Ju Ching Chu Secondary School (Kwai Chung)]]\n*[[Kiangsu-Chekiang College (Kwai Chung)]]\n*[[Kwai Chung Methodist College]]\n*[[Lai King Catholic Secondary School]]\n*[[Lingnan Dr Chung Wing Kwong Memorial Secondary School]]\n*[[Lions College]]\n*[[Lok Sin Tong Ku Chiu Man Secondary School]]\n*[[Lok Sin Tong Leung Chik Wai Memorial School]]\n*[[Po Leung Kuk Lo Kit Sing (1983) College]]\n*[[Pope Paul VI College]]\n*[[Queen's College Old Boys' Association Secondary School]]\n*[[Salesians of Don Bosco Ng Siu Mui Secondary School]]\n*[[Shek Lei Catholic Secondary School]]\n*[[Sheung Kwai Chung Government Secondary School]]\n*[[Shun Tak Fraternal Association Lee Shau Kee College]]\n*[[Sheng Kung Hui Lam Woo Memorial Secondary School]]\n*[[Methodist Lee Wai Lee College|The Methodist Lee Wai Lee College]]\n*[[Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Chen Zao Men College]]\n*[[Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Mrs Wu York Yu Memorial College]]\n*[[Tung Wah Group of Hospitals S.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ron Funches]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=April 2020}}\nA celebration of the Techno Trolls is crashed by the [[Rock music|Rock Trolls]], led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her [[guitar]]'s power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the blue string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still adjusting to her new role as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father, King Peppy tells the story of how the Troll tribes became scattered throughout their world Troll Kingdom. He explains how the six primary tribes, each represented by a different style of music: [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Funk]]. [[Classical music|Classical]], [[Techno]], [[Country music|Country]], and [[Rock music|Rock]] are powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having separated their tribes following discord and disagreement over which style of music was the best, Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Queen Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy refuses to  listen, sending a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power chord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with [[Rock music|rock]].\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him after realising one of the Troll Tribes look just like him. He goes into a forest coming upon a monster. He escapes but ends up lost in a desert. He tries to drink from a mirage, but snaps out of it and is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles. \n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, is in ruins. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy their town had been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens and stole the yellow Classical string. Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the pink Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn, leader of the Country Trolls.\n\nWhile in jail, a Country Troll named Hickory, claiming to be moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Hickory builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Queen Barb. Chaz plays smooth jazz which causes Poppy and Branch to fall into a dream-like state, imagining [[Narwhal|narwhals]] and Branch feeding sushi sized replicas of himself to Poppy with chopsticks. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been the long lost identical twin of the Funk Troll prince, Prince D, of the Funk Trolls all along. His egg was snatched out of the nest when he and his twin were babies. His Mum and Dad couldn\u2019t find him so the Pop Trolls raised his as one of their own. Cooper then tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Funk]]. His parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, also reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop music|Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls hijack the Funk Trolls' ship to steal the purple Funk String, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory urges her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. Biggie returns home and after seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls. \n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending [[music]], and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to [[sing]] together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of [[music]] are, and encouraged by her father Thrash, the repented Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events that have taken place, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the optimistic Queen of the Pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist Pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the wild-hearted Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls, and Barb's semi-senile father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll who is Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ron Funches]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=April 2020}}\nA celebration of the Techno Trolls is crashed by the [[Rock music|Rock Trolls]], led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her [[guitar]]'s power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the blue string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still adjusting to her new role as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father, King Peppy tells the story of how the Troll tribes became scattered throughout their world Troll Kingdom. He explains how the six primary tribes, each represented by a different style of music: [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Funk]]. [[Classical music|Classical]], [[Techno]], [[Country music|Country]], and [[Rock music|Rock]] are powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having separated their tribes following discord and disagreement over which style of music was the best, Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Queen Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy refuses to  listen, sending a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power chord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with [[Rock music|rock]].\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him after realising one of the Troll Tribes look just like him. He goes into a forest coming upon a monster. He escapes but ends up lost in a desert. He tries to drink from a mirage, but snaps out of it and is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles. \n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, is in ruins. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy their town had been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens and stole the yellow Classical string. Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the pink Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn, leader of the Country Trolls.\n\nWhile in jail, a Country Troll named Hickory, claiming to be moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Hickory builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Queen Barb. Chaz plays smooth jazz which causes Poppy and Branch to fall into a dream-like state, imagining [[Narwhal|narwhals]] and Branch feeding sushi sized replicas of himself to Poppy with chopsticks. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been the long lost identical twin of the Funk Troll prince, Prince D, of the Funk Trolls all along. His egg was snatched out of the nest when he and his twin were babies. His Mum and Dad couldn\u2019t find him so the Pop Trolls raised his as one of their own. Cooper then tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Funk]]. His parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, also reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop music|Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls hijack the Funk Trolls' ship to steal the purple Funk String, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory urges her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. Biggie returns home and after seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls. \n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending [[music]], and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to [[sing]] together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of [[music]] are, and encouraged by her father Thrash, the repented Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events that have taken place, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the optimistic Queen of the Pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist Pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the wild-hearted Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls, and Barb's semi-senile father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll who is Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.
