He arrived in the territory in 1914 to work as an organiser for the [[Australian Workers' Union]] (AWU), and was a leader of the [[Darwin rebellion]] of 1918. He subsequently served in the House of Representatives from 1922 to 1934, initially as an [[independent politician|independent]] and then as a member of the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]].\n\n== Early life ==\nNelson was born in [[Botany, New South Wales]], the son of Elizabeth Ann (n\u00e9e Tighe) and John Nelson. His father was a Scottish-born shopkeeper. According to the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', \"little is known of his early years and nothing of his education\". Nelson moved to [[Queensland]] as a young man, working as an engine-driver at [[Gympie]] and [[Mount Perry, Queensland|Mount Perry]].<ref name=\"adb\">{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/nelson-harold-george-7737|title=Nelson, Harold George (1881\u20131947)|last=Carment|first=David|date=1986|website=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|access-date=15 April 2018|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University}}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\n[[File:Harold Nelson (Australian politician).jpg|thumb|left|Caricature of Nelson by Thomas Glover, 1923]]\nNelson, his wife Maud, and their five children moved to [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory]] in 1913 where he continued to work as an engine driver and began his involvement in union affairs.  Nelson started work as an organiser for the [[Australian Workers' Union]] in 1914 and became the first secretary of the AWU's [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] branch.\n\nThe influence of the AWU in the [[Northern Territory]] grew in significance and so did Nelson. By the end of 1917, 40% of all white men in the Territory belonged to the AWU and Nelson used his standing in the community to gain election to Darwin Town Council.\n\nDescribed as a \"medium-sized nuggety man\" and a fiery orator, Nelson was an effective campaigner, as can be seen by his successful campaign to significantly raise the wages of Darwin meatworkers in 1917.  He also led protests against the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory|Northern Territory Administrator]] Dr [[John A. Gilruth]], which officially originated in November 1918 when Gilruth refused requests from barmaids for time off to celebrate the end of [[World War I]] (although tensions had been simmering between Gilruth and the union movement for some time).  On 17 December 1918, in what has since been called the [[Darwin Rebellion]], Nelson led a protest march to Liberty Square, in front of Government House, to demand Gilruth's removal as Administrator.  Continued protests eventually led to the removal of Dr Gilruth from the Administrator position in February 1919, followed by the departure of other senior officials soon after.<ref>Powell, A. (1988)  ''Far Country: A Short History of the Northern Territory'' (2nd Edition), Melbourne University Press, Carlton.  {{ISBN|0-522-84377-8}}.</ref>\n\nNelson then turned his attention to campaigning for Northern Territory representation in the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian parliament]], including refusing to pay taxes in an echo of the American War of Independence cry of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\".  After a brief gaol stint, Nelson's campaign resulted in the establishment of a Northern Territory-based seat (albeit non-voting) in the House of Representatives.\n\nAfter standing down as AWU secretary, Nelson successfully stood for the new seat as an independent at the [[1922 Australian federal election|1922 election]] (although he would join the [[Australian Labor Party]] soon after).\n\nNelson spent his time in parliament campaigning for greater expenditure and self-government for the Northern Territory, with little success.

They are colloquially known as [[Mizrahi Jews]]. They include descendants of Babylonian Jews and Mountain Jews from modern Iraq, Morocco, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Syria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran, Uzbekistan, the Caucasus, Kurdistan, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Yemen. Since the 1950s because of growing antisemitism, most of these Jews fled to Israel where they make up the majority of Israel's Jewish population and roughly a third of total world Jewry. While they no longer live among a Muslim majority, they continue to follow many customs with strong Muslim and Middle Eastern influences making them distinct from European Jewry.\nToday [[Judaism]] in the Middle East is mostly practiced in Israel. Israel's population is 75.3% Jewish, with the remainder made up of Muslims (20.6%), [[Christians]], [[Druze]], [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] and various other minorities (4.1%).<ref>http://www1.cbs.gov.il/reader/?MIval=cw_usr_view_SHTML&ID=705</ref> There are few other countries in the Middle East with significant Jewish populations, but the communities are small and scattered.\n\n==Christianity==\n{{See also|Christianity in the Middle East}}\nChristianity [[Origins of Christianity|originated]] in the region in the 1st century AD, and was one of the major religions of the region until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the mid-to-late 7th century AD.

The [[eponym]]ously named Alawites revere [[Ali]] (Ali ibn Abi Talib), considered the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|1st Imam]] of the Twelver school. However, they are generally considered to be [[Ghulat]] by most other sects of Shia Islam. The sect is believed to have been founded by [[Ibn Nusayr]] during the 9th century, and fully established as a religion, For this reason, Alawites are sometimes called ''Nusayris'' ({{lang-ar|\u0646\u0635\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0629}} ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012byyah''), although the term has come to be used as a pejorative in the modern era.

Today, Alawites represent 11 percent of the [[Syrian people|Syrian]] population and are a significant minority in Turkey and northern Lebanon. There is also a population living in the village of [[Ghajar]] in the [[Golan Heights]]. They are often confused with the [[Alevi]]s of Turkey.

Israel represents the religious Holy Land for Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Baha'is. All religions are present in Israel and lay personal claim to the land. Due to the significant Israeli/Palestinian conflict, tensions are high in the religious community.

The [[eponym]]ously named Alawites revere [[Ali]] (Ali ibn Abi Talib), considered the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|1st Imam]] of the Twelver school. However, they are generally considered to be [[Ghulat]] by most other sects of Shia Islam. The sect is believed to have been founded by [[Ibn Nusayr]] during the 9th century, and fully established as a religion, For this reason, Alawites are sometimes called ''Nusayris'' ({{lang-ar|\u0646\u0635\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0629}} ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012byyah''), although the term has come to be used as a pejorative in the modern era. Another name, ''Ansari'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629}} ''An\u1e63\u0101riyyah''), is believed to be a mistransliteration of ''Nusayri''. Today, Alawites represent 11 percent of the [[Syrian people|Syrian]] population and are a significant minority in Turkey and northern Lebanon. There is also a population living in the village of [[Ghajar]] in the [[Golan Heights]]. They are often confused with the [[Alevi]]s of Turkey. Alawites form the dominant religious group on the Syrian coast and towns near the coast which is also inhabited by Sunnis, [[Christianity in Syria|Christians]], and [[Ismailis]].\n\nAlawites have historically kept their beliefs secret from outsiders and non-initiated Alawites.<ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:68>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.68</ref><ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:67>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.67</ref> At the core of Alawite belief is a divine triad, comprising three aspects of the one God.\n\nAlawites have traditionally lived in the [[An-Nusayriyah Mountains]] along the Mediterranean coast of Syria.

Many countries have now developed their branches. Many are violent and most Arab governments actively try to restrain the group by arresting and killing members. Currently, as the new government of Egypt is trying to establish itself, many are concerned that a member of the Muslim Brotherhood will again step in and claim leadership.

Israel represents the religious Holy Land for Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Baha'is. All religions are present in Israel and lay personal claim to the land. Due to the significant Israeli/Palestinian conflict, tensions are high in the religious community. The majority of displaced and upset Palestinians are Muslim and the majority of current Israeli citizens are Jewish so establishing the state borders is highly influenced by religion.\n\nOne of the main difficulties in establishing peace between the two countries is because of [[Jerusalem]].

The previous laws disallowing the [[Hijab]], religious headscarf, in schools and public places has been a huge source of contention. Now, it is a matter of civil rights in courts. The case of [[Sahin 2004]] was one that exemplified the tension between religious secularism, civil rights and the government's power in Turkey.<ref name=Turkey>{{cite book|last=Durham|first=Cole|title=Islam, Europe and Emerging Legal Issues|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate}}</ref> The case revolved around a student at university being allowed to wear the Hijab in class.<ref name=Turkey /> Religious education is also a topic of debate in Turkey.

As of 2014, the series consists of sixteen compilation albums.\n\nThough predominantly a series of cover albums, ''[[Punk Goes Acoustic]]'', ''[[Punk Goes Acoustic 2]]'' and ''Punk Goes Acoustic 3'' completely deviate from this theme, featuring only acoustic versions of original songs by the featured bands, while 2013's ''[[Punk Goes Christmas]]'' features a mix of both Christmas-themed original songs and covers. Similarly, the series' first installment, 2000's ''[[Punk Goes Metal]]'', consists entirely of covers with the exception of \"Why Rock?\" performed by [[The Aquabats]], which was in fact an original song credited to a fictitious band called \"Leather Pyrate\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! colspan=\"2\" | Chart

As of 2014, the series consists of sixteen compilation albums.\n\nThough predominantly a series of cover albums, ''[[Punk Goes Acoustic]]'', ''[[Punk Goes Acoustic 2]]'' and ''Punk Goes Acoustic 3'' completely deviate from this theme, featuring only acoustic versions of original songs by the featured bands, while 2013's ''[[Punk Goes Christmas]]'' features a mix of both Christmas-themed original songs and covers. Similarly, the series' first installment, 2000's ''[[Punk Goes Metal]]'', consists entirely of covers with the exception of \"Why Rock?\" performed by [[The Aquabats]], which was in fact an original song credited to a fictitious band called \"Leather Pyrate\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! colspan=\"2\" | Chart

In the 2nd millennium, the eastern coastlines of the Mediterranean are dominated by the [[Hittite Empire|Hittite]] and [[Egyptian Empire|Egyptian]] empires, competing for control over the city states in the Levant ([[Canaan]]).\n\nThe ''[[Bronze Age collapse]]'' is the transition from the [[Late Bronze Age]] to the [[Early Iron Age]], expressed by the collapse of [[palace economy|palace economies]] of the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] and [[Anatolia]], which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the [[Dark Ages in history|Dark Age period in history]] of the ancient Near East.

Muhly, ''The Coming of the Age of Iron'' (New Haven) 1980.</ref> The cultural collapse of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean kingdoms]], the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] and [[Syria]], and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian Empire]] in [[Syria]] and [[Israel]], the scission of long-distance [[trade route|trade]] contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BC. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between [[Troy]] and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example, [[Hattusas]], [[Mycenae]], [[Ugarit]]). The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the rise of settled [[Neo-Hittite]] [[Aramaean]] kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].\n\nWhile the cultural advances during the Bronze Age had mostly been confined to the eastern parts of the Mediterranean, with the Iron Age, the entire coastal region surrounding the Mediterranean now becomes involved, significantly due to the [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] expansion from the Levant, beginning in ca. the 12th century. [[Fernand Braudel]] remarked in ''The Perspective of the World'' that Phoenicia was an early example of a \"world-economy\" surrounded by empires. The high point of Phoenician culture and sea power is usually placed ca. 1200\u2013800&nbsp;BC. Many of the most important Phoenician settlements had been established long before this: [[Byblos]], [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], and [[Beirut|Berytus]], all appear in the [[Amarna tablets]].\n\nThe Phoenicians and the Assyrians transported elements of the Late Bronze Age culture of the Near East to Iron Age [[Archaic Greece|Greece]] and [[Iron Age Italy|Italy]], but also further afield to [[Ancient Libya|Northwestern Africa]] and to [[Tartessos|Iberia]], initiating the beginning of Mediterranean history now known as [[Classical Antiquity]].\nThey notably spread [[History of the alphabet|alphabetic writing]], which would become the hallmark of the Mediterranean civilizations of the Iron Age, in contrast to the [[Assyrian cuneiform|cuneiform]] writing of Assyria and the [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|logographic]] system in the Far East (and later the [[abugida]] systems of India).\n\n== Classical antiquity ==\n[[File:Greek Colonization Archaic Period.svg|thumb|250px|[[Magna Graecia|Greek colonies]] during the 8th and 7th centuries BC.]]\nTwo of the most notable Mediterranean civilizations in [[classical antiquity]] were the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city state]]s and the [[Phoenicia]]ns. The Greeks expanded throughout the [[Black Sea]] and south through the [[Red Sea]]. The Phoenicians spread through the western Mediterranean reaching [[North Africa]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. From the 6th century BC up to including the 5th century BC, many of the significant Mediterranean peoples were under Persian rule, making them dominate the Mediterranean during these years. Both the Phoenicians and some of the [[Greek city states]] in Asia Minor provided the naval forces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. Persian dominance ended after the [[Greco-Persian War]] in the 5th century BC and Persia was crippled by Macedonia in the 4th century BC.

The ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]]) was considered the strongest of their time.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, Arrian</ref> Under [[Alexander the Great]], this force turned east, and in a series of decisive battles, it routed the Persian forces and took over as the dominant empire of the Mediterranean. Their Macedonia empire included present-day Greece, Bulgaria, Egypt, the Phoenician lands and many other basin regions of the Mediterranean and Asia Minor.\n\nThe major centres of the Mediterranean at the time became part of Alexander's empire as a result. His empire quickly disintegrated, and the Middle East, Egypt, and Greece were soon again independent. Alexander's conquests spread Greek knowledge and ideas throughout the region.\n\n=== Roman\u2013Carthaginian rivalry ===\n{{See also|Punic Wars|Roman Republic|Ancient Carthage|Carthage}}\n\nThese eastern powers soon began to be overshadowed by those farther west. In North Africa, the former Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] rose to dominate its surroundings with an empire that contained many of the former Phoenician holdings. However, it was a city on the [[Italian Peninsula]], [[Rome]], that would eventually dominate the entire Mediterranean basin. Spreading first through Italy, Rome defeated Carthage in the [[Punic Wars]], despite [[Hannibal]]'s famous efforts against Rome in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\nAfter the [[Third Punic War]], Rome then became the leading force in the Mediterranean region. The Romans soon spread east, taking Greece, and the Greek heritage played an important role in the Roman Empire. By this point the coastal trading cultures were thoroughly dominant over the inland river valleys that had once been the heart of the great powers. Egyptian power moved from the Nile cities to the coastal ones, especially [[Alexandria]]. Mesopotamia became a fringe border region between the Roman Empire and the Persians.\n\n=== Roman ''Mare Nostrum'' ===\n[[File:The Roman Empire ca 400 AD.png|thumb|250px|The ''Mare nostrum'', surrounded by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] territory in c. 400 AD.]]\n{{further|Mare Nostrum|Roman Empire}}\n\nWhen [[Augustus]] founded the [[Roman Empire]], the Mediterranean sea began to be called ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: \"Our Sea\") by the Romans. Their empire was centered on this sea and all the area was full of commerce and naval development. For the first time in history, an entire sea (the Mediterranean) was free of piracy. For several centuries, the Mediterranean was a \"Roman Lake\", surrounded on all sides by the empire.\n\nThe empire began to crumble, however, in the fifth century and [[Rome]] collapsed after 476 CE.\n\n=== Sasanian and Byzantine times ===\n{{Main|Sasanian Empire}} and {{Main|Byzantine Empire}}\nThe Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine empire]] began its domination of the Levant during its [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars|wars with neighbouring Sassanid Persia]]. The rule through the 6th century CE saw climatic instability, causing inconsistent production, distribution, and a general economic decline.<ref>Daniel Fuks, Avner Ayalon, et al., \"Dust clouds, climate change and coins: consiliences of palaeoclimate and economy in the Late Antique southern Levant\", ''Journal of the Council for British Research in the Levant'' 49/2 (Oct. 2017): 205-223.\nDownload citation https://doi.org/10.1080/00758914.2017.1379181</ref> The Sasanians gained territory on Mediterranean land regularly, but the Eastern Romans remained superior in the Mediterranean sea for centuries. In the first quarter of the 7th century CE, the Sasanians took swaths of the Mediterranean region from the Eastern Romans during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], though the Sasanians lost territories by the end of the war. Ultimately, Byzantine domination in the region was forever finished by invasions of the Arabs and later the Turks.<ref>Crawford, Peter (2013).

In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army|Arab armies]], motivated by Islam and led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East; [[Byzantine-Arab Wars|reducing Byzantine lands]] by more than half and completely [[Islamic conquest of Persia|engulfing the Persian lands]].\n\nThe Arab invasions disrupted the trade relations between Western and Eastern Europe while cutting the trade route with Oriental lands. This however had the indirect effect of promoting the trade across the [[Caspian Sea]]. The export of grains from [[Egypt]] was re-routed towards the [[Eastern world]]. Oriental goods like silk and spices were carried from Egypt to ports like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Constantinople]] by sailors and Jewish merchants. The [[Viking expansion|Viking raids]] further disrupted the trade in western Europe and brought it to a halt. However, the [[Norsemen]] developed the trade from Norway to the [[White Sea]], while also trading in luxury goods from [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] and the Mediterranean. The [[Byzantine Empire under the Isaurian dynasty|Byzantines in the mid-8th century]] retook control of the area around the north-eastern part of the Mediterranean. Venetian ships from the 9th century armed themselves to counter the harassment by Arabs while concentrating trade of oriental goods at Venice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Couper|first=Alastair|title=The Geography of Sea Transport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFVACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=The+Geography+of+Sea+Transport&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxmJiKorfdAhXHXrwKHWxpBvQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1-317-35150-4|page=33\u201337|access-date=2018-09-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913112908/https://books.google.com/books?id=WFVACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=The+Geography+of+Sea+Transport&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxmJiKorfdAhXHXrwKHWxpBvQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=2018-09-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe powerful and long-lived [[Bulgarian Empire]] was the main European rival in the region of the Mediterranean [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] between the 7th and the 14th centuries, creating an important [[Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture|cultural]], [[Third Rome|political]], [[Cyrillic script|linguistic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Slavs|religious]] legacy during the [[Middle Ages]]. \n\nIn [[Anatolia]], the Muslim [[Siege of Constantinople (718)|expansion was blocked]] by the still capable Byzantines with the help of the [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Byzantine provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Roman Syria]], [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]], and Sicily, however, could not mount such a resistance, and the Muslim conquerors swept through those regions. At the far west, they crossed the sea taking [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Visigothic Hispania]] before being [[Battle of Tours|halted in southern France]] by the [[Franks]]. At its greatest extent, the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] controlled 3/4 of the Mediterranean region, the only other empire besides the Roman Empire to control most of the Mediterranean Sea.<ref>Subhi Y.

After its conquest by the Christian [[Normans]], the island developed its own distinct culture with the fusion of Latin and Byzantine influences.

The threat of becoming a slave was a constant fear for peasants, fishermen and merchants. Those with money or who had financial backing only feared the lack of support, should they be threatened with abduction for ransom.\n\nThere were several things which could happen to people in the Mediterranean region of the Middle Ages:\n# When [[wikt:corsair|Corsairs]], [[piracy|pirate]], [[Barbary corsairs]], [[French corsairs]] or [[commerce raiders]] plied their trade, a peasant, fisherman or coastal villager, who had no financial backing, could be abducted or sold to slave traders, or adversaries, who made large profits on an international market;\n# If the captive was wealthy or had influential supporters, the captive could be ransomed. This would be the most advantageous plan, since the money exchange was immediate and direct, not long and drawn out as in the slave market business;\n# The captive could be used immediately by the corsair for labour on the ship rather than traded. In battles during this era, prisoners of war were often captured and used as slaves.\n\nEmperors would take large numbers of prisoners, parade them through the capital, hold feasts in honour of their capture and parade diplomats in front of them as a display of victory.<ref name=\"Europe and the Islamic World: A History \">{{cite book|author1=Tolan, John |author2=Veinstein, Gilles |author3=Henry Laurens |title=\"Europe and the Islamic World: A History\".|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-14705-5|pages=67\u201368}}</ref>\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n{{further|Maritime republics|Crown of Aragon|Crown of Castile|Ottoman Empire}}\n\n[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|250px|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].]]\nThe \"Repubbliche Marinare\" (Maritime republics) of [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Ancona|Ancona]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] developed their own \"empires\" in the Mediterranean shores. The Islamic states had never been major naval powers, and trade from the east to Europe was soon in the hands of Italian traders, especially the Genoese and the Venetians, who profited immensely from it. The [[Republic of Pisa]] and later the [[Republic of Ragusa]] used diplomacy to further trade and maintained a libertarian approach in civil matters to further sentiment in its inhabitants.\n\nThe [[republic of Venice]] got to dominate the eastern mediterranean shores after the [[Fourth Crusade]].{{Sfn|Banaji|2007|p=62-63}}\n\nBetween 1275 and 1344 a struggle for the control of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] took place. Featuring the [[Marinid Sultanate]], the [[Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], the [[Crown of Castile]], the [[Crown of Arag\u00f3n]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the [[Republic of Genoa]], it was characterized by changing alliances between the main actors.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|1996\u20131997|p=405}} The iberian cities of [[Tarifa]], [[Ceuta]], [[Algeciras]] or [[Ronda]] and the African port of [[Ceuta]] were at stake.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|1996\u20131997|p=405}}\nThe Western Mediterranean sea was dominated by the [[Crown of Aragon]]: thanks to their possessions of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Duchy of Athens]] the [[Duchy of Neopatria]], and several northern African cities.\n\nIn 1347 the [[Black Death]] spread from [[Constantinople]] across the mediterranean basin.{{Sfn|Sola|2006|p=46}}\n\nOttoman power continued to grow, and in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was extinguished with the [[fall of Constantinople]]. The Ottomans already controlled Greece, [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and much of the [[Balkans]] and soon also began to spread through North Africa. North Africa had grown wealthy from the trade across the [[Sahara Desert]], but the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who, along with other Christian powers, had been engaged in a long campaign to evict the Muslims from Iberia, had found a method to circumvent this trade by trading directly with [[West Africa]].  This was enabled by a new type of ships, the [[caravel]], that made trade in the rough Atlantic waters profitable for the first time.  The reduction in the Saharan trade weakened North Africa, and made them an easy target for the Ottomans.\n\nCeuta was ultimately taken by the Kingdom of Portugal in 1415, searching to undermine Castilian, Aragonese, and Genoese interests in the area.{{Sfn|Banaji|2007|pp=49; 63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, rival Christian and Muslim kingdoms forbade the trade of particular goods to enemy kingdoms including weaponry and other contraband items. The popes forbade the export of these commodities to the Islamic world. The Ottomans too forbade the export of weapons and other strategic items, declaring them ''memnu e\u015fya'' or ''memnu olan'' to Christian states even in peace treaties, however friendly states could import some of the prohibited goods through [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]]. Despite these prohibitions, trade of contraband occurred on both sides. The European merchants traded in illegal goods with Muslims. The Ottomans were unable to suppress the trade with smuggling being undertaken mainly in the winter when the [[Ottoman Navy]] stationed at the [[Imperial Arsenal|Istanbul Arsenal]] was unable to stop Ottoman and non-Ottoman vessels from indulging in the trade.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|authors=Ga \u0301bor A \u0301goston, Bruce Alan Masters|page=145|publisher=Infobase Publishing}}</ref>\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{further|Ottoman Empire|Portuguese Empire|Spanish Empire|Italian Empire}}\n\n[[File:OttomanEmpireIn1683.png|thumb|250px|[[Ottoman Empire]] territories acquired between 1300 and 1683.]]\n[[File:ItalianMareNostrum.jpg|thumb|250px|Greatest extent of Italian control of the Mediterranean littoral and seas (within green line & dots) in summer/fall 1942. Allied-controlled areas in red.]]\nThe growing naval prowess of the European powers confronted further rapid Ottoman expansion in the region when the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] checked the power of the Ottoman navy. However, as [[Braudel]] argued forcefully, this only slowed the Ottoman expansion instead of ending it. The prized island of [[Cyprus]] became Ottoman in 1571. The last resistance in [[Tunisia]] ended in 1574 and almost a generation long siege in [[Crete]] pushed Venetians out of this strategic island in 1669.\n\nA [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was then established between [[Spain]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] until the 18th century, each dominating their respective half of Mediterranean, reducing Italian navies as naval powers increasingly more irrelevant. Furthermore, the Ottoman Empire had succeeded in their objective of extending Muslim rule across the North African coast.\n\nThe development of long range seafaring had an influence upon the entire Mediterranean. While once all trade from the east had passed through the region, the [[Portuguese discoveries|circumnavigation of Africa]] allowed [[gold]], [[spice]]s, and [[dye]]s to be imported directly to the Atlantic ports of western Europe.  The Americas were also a source of extreme wealth to the western powers, from which some of the Mediterranean states were largely cut off.\n\nThe base of European power thus shifted northward and the once wealthy [[Italy]] became a peripheral area dominated by foreigners.  The Ottoman Empire also began a slow decline that saw its North African possessions gain de facto independence and its European holdings gradually reduced by the increasing power of Austria and Russia.\n\nBy the nineteenth century the European States were vastly more powerful, and began to colonize North Africa.  France spread its power south by taking [[Algeria]] in 1830 and later [[Tunisia]]. Britain gained control of [[Egypt]] in 1882. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] conquered [[Libya]] from the Ottomans in 1911. Greece [[Greek War of Independence|achieved independence in 1832]]. The Ottoman Empire finally collapsed in the [[World War I|First World War]], and its holdings were carved up among France and Britain. The [[rump state]] of the wider Ottoman Empire became the independent state of [[Turkey]] in 1923. Yugoslavia was created from the former Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the First World War.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century the Mediterranean was at the center of the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and was one of the main areas of battle during [[World War II]] between the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Post-world war period was marked by increasing activity in the Eastern Mediterranean, where naval actions formed part of ongoing Arab\u2013Israeli conflict and Turkey had [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|occupied the northern part of Cyprus]]. Cold War tensions split the Mediterranean into pro-American and pro-Soviet factions, with Turkey, Greece, Spain, Italy and France being [[NATO]] members. Syria was socialist and a pro-Soviet regime, offering the Soviets [[Tartus|a port for their navy]] from an agreement in 1971. Yugoslavia was Communist but in neither the Soviet nor American camps. Egypt tilted towards the Soviets during the time of [[Nasser]] but then turned towards American influence during the time of [[Sadat]]. Israel and Egypt both received massive American military aid.

In the first phase of this period, almost every city between [[Troy]] and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example, [[Hattusas]], [[Mycenae]], [[Ugarit]]). The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the rise of settled [[Neo-Hittite]] [[Aramaean]] kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].\n\nWhile the cultural advances during the Bronze Age had mostly been confined to the eastern parts of the Mediterranean, with the Iron Age, the entire coastal region surrounding the Mediterranean now becomes involved, significantly due to the [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] expansion from the Levant, beginning in ca. the 12th century. [[Fernand Braudel]] remarked in ''The Perspective of the World'' that Phoenicia was an early example of a \"world-economy\" surrounded by empires. The high point of Phoenician culture and sea power is usually placed ca. 1200\u2013800&nbsp;BC. Many of the most important Phoenician settlements had been established long before this: [[Byblos]], [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], and [[Beirut|Berytus]], all appear in the [[Amarna tablets]].\n\nThe Phoenicians and the Assyrians transported elements of the Late Bronze Age culture of the Near East to Iron Age [[Archaic Greece|Greece]] and [[Iron Age Italy|Italy]], but also further afield to [[Ancient Libya|Northwestern Africa]] and to [[Tartessos|Iberia]], initiating the beginning of Mediterranean history now known as [[Classical Antiquity]].\nThey notably spread [[History of the alphabet|alphabetic writing]], which would become the hallmark of the Mediterranean civilizations of the Iron Age, in contrast to the [[Assyrian cuneiform|cuneiform]] writing of Assyria and the [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|logographic]] system in the Far East (and later the [[abugida]] systems of India).\n\n== Classical antiquity ==\n[[File:Greek Colonization Archaic Period.svg|thumb|250px|[[Magna Graecia|Greek colonies]] during the 8th and 7th centuries BC.]]\nTwo of the most notable Mediterranean civilizations in [[classical antiquity]] were the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city state]]s and the [[Phoenicia]]ns. The Greeks expanded throughout the [[Black Sea]] and south through the [[Red Sea]]. The Phoenicians spread through the western Mediterranean reaching [[North Africa]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. From the 6th century BC up to including the 5th century BC, many of the significant Mediterranean peoples were under Persian rule, making them dominate the Mediterranean during these years. Both the Phoenicians and some of the [[Greek city states]] in Asia Minor provided the naval forces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. Persian dominance ended after the [[Greco-Persian War]] in the 5th century BC and Persia was crippled by Macedonia in the 4th century BC. The [[Odrysian Kingdom]] existed between the 5th century BC and the 1st century AD as the most important and powerful [[Thracians|thracian]] state formation.\n\n=== Persian period ===\n{{further|Achaemenid Empire}}\nFrom the 6th century BC up to including the first half of the 4th century BC, many of the significant Mediterranean peoples came under [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian]] rule, making them dominate the Mediterranean during all these years. The empire, founded by [[Cyrus the Great]], would include [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], [[Thracians|Thrace]] and the western [[Black sea]] coast (modern day southeastern and eastern [[Bulgaria]]), Egypt, [[Anatolia]], the Phoenician lands, the [[Levant]], and many other basin regions of the Mediterranean later on.<ref>''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth,{{ISBN|0-19-860641-9}},\"page 1515,\"The Thracians were subdued by the Persians by 516\"</ref><ref>Joseph Roisman, Ian Worthington [https://books.google.com/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&pg=PA345#v=onepage&q&f=false ''A Companion to Ancient Macedonia''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224121356/https://books.google.com/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&pg=PA345#v=onepage&q&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2017-02-24 }} pp. 342\u2013345, John Wiley & Sons, 7 July 2011 {{ISBN|144435163X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&pg=PA345&lpg=PA345&dq=Achaemenid+Persians+ruled+balkans&source=bl&ots=K7qasgPG1K&sig=lkiajbVuNcHEbI5Lz3MnvIUBG1U&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=sb6RVP2qHoPUaqeGgZgE&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Achaemenid%20Persians%20ruled%20balkans&f=false|title=A Companion to Ancient Macedonia|page=345|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=17 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422224651/https://books.google.com/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&pg=PA345&lpg=PA345&dq=Achaemenid+Persians+ruled+balkans&source=bl&ots=K7qasgPG1K&sig=lkiajbVuNcHEbI5Lz3MnvIUBG1U&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=sb6RVP2qHoPUaqeGgZgE&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Achaemenid%20Persians%20ruled%20balkans&f=false|archive-date=22 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Darius the Great]] (Darius I) is to be credited as the first Achaemenid king to invest in a Persian fleet.<ref name=navy>{{cite book |author=Kaveh Farrokh |title=Shadows in the desert: ancient Persia at war |url=https://books.google.com/?id=p7kltwf9yrwC |year=2007 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=978-1-84603-108-3 |page=68}}</ref> Even by then no true \"imperial navy\" had existed either in Greece or Egypt.

The ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]]) was considered the strongest of their time.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, Arrian</ref> Under [[Alexander the Great]], this force turned east, and in a series of decisive battles, it routed the Persian forces and took over as the dominant empire of the Mediterranean. Their Macedonia empire included present-day Greece, Bulgaria, Egypt, the Phoenician lands and many other basin regions of the Mediterranean and Asia Minor.\n\nThe major centres of the Mediterranean at the time became part of Alexander's empire as a result. His empire quickly disintegrated, and the Middle East, Egypt, and Greece were soon again independent. Alexander's conquests spread Greek knowledge and ideas throughout the region.\n\n=== Roman\u2013Carthaginian rivalry ===\n{{See also|Punic Wars|Roman Republic|Ancient Carthage|Carthage}}\n\nThese eastern powers soon began to be overshadowed by those farther west. In North Africa, the former Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] rose to dominate its surroundings with an empire that contained many of the former Phoenician holdings. However, it was a city on the [[Italian Peninsula]], [[Rome]], that would eventually dominate the entire Mediterranean basin. Spreading first through Italy, Rome defeated Carthage in the [[Punic Wars]], despite [[Hannibal]]'s famous efforts against Rome in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\nAfter the [[Third Punic War]], Rome then became the leading force in the Mediterranean region. The Romans soon spread east, taking Greece, and the Greek heritage played an important role in the Roman Empire. By this point the coastal trading cultures were thoroughly dominant over the inland river valleys that had once been the heart of the great powers. Egyptian power moved from the Nile cities to the coastal ones, especially [[Alexandria]]. Mesopotamia became a fringe border region between the Roman Empire and the Persians.\n\n=== Roman ''Mare Nostrum'' ===\n[[File:The Roman Empire ca 400 AD.png|thumb|250px|The ''Mare nostrum'', surrounded by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] territory in c. 400 AD.]]\n{{further|Mare Nostrum|Roman Empire}}\n\nWhen [[Augustus]] founded the [[Roman Empire]], the Mediterranean sea began to be called ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: \"Our Sea\") by the Romans. Their empire was centered on this sea and all the area was full of commerce and naval development. For the first time in history, an entire sea (the Mediterranean) was free of piracy. For several centuries, the Mediterranean was a \"Roman Lake\", surrounded on all sides by the empire.\n\nThe empire began to crumble, however, in the fifth century and [[Rome]] collapsed after 476 CE.\n\n=== Sasanian and Byzantine times ===\n{{Main|Sasanian Empire}} and {{Main|Byzantine Empire}}\nThe Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine empire]] began its domination of the Levant during its [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars|wars with neighbouring Sassanid Persia]]. The rule through the 6th century CE saw climatic instability, causing inconsistent production, distribution, and a general economic decline.<ref>Daniel Fuks, Avner Ayalon, et al., \"Dust clouds, climate change and coins: consiliences of palaeoclimate and economy in the Late Antique southern Levant\", ''Journal of the Council for British Research in the Levant'' 49/2 (Oct. 2017): 205-223.\nDownload citation https://doi.org/10.1080/00758914.2017.1379181</ref> The Sasanians gained territory on Mediterranean land regularly, but the Eastern Romans remained superior in the Mediterranean sea for centuries. In the first quarter of the 7th century CE, the Sasanians took swaths of the Mediterranean region from the Eastern Romans during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], though the Sasanians lost territories by the end of the war. Ultimately, Byzantine domination in the region was forever finished by invasions of the Arabs and later the Turks.<ref>Crawford, Peter (2013).

In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army|Arab armies]], motivated by Islam and led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East; [[Byzantine-Arab Wars|reducing Byzantine lands]] by more than half and completely [[Islamic conquest of Persia|engulfing the Persian lands]].\n\nThe Arab invasions disrupted the trade relations between Western and Eastern Europe while cutting the trade route with Oriental lands. This however had the indirect effect of promoting the trade across the [[Caspian Sea]]. The export of grains from [[Egypt]] was re-routed towards the [[Eastern world]]. Oriental goods like silk and spices were carried from Egypt to ports like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Constantinople]] by sailors and Jewish merchants. The [[Viking expansion|Viking raids]] further disrupted the trade in western Europe and brought it to a halt.

The Crusades were unsuccessful in this goal, but they were far more effective in weakening the already tottering Byzantine Empire that began to lose increasing amounts of territory to the [[Seljuk Turks]] and later to the [[Ottoman Turks]].

The threat of becoming a slave was a constant fear for peasants, fishermen and merchants. Those with money or who had financial backing only feared the lack of support, should they be threatened with abduction for ransom.\n\nThere were several things which could happen to people in the Mediterranean region of the Middle Ages:\n# When [[wikt:corsair|Corsairs]], [[piracy|pirate]], [[Barbary corsairs]], [[French corsairs]] or [[commerce raiders]] plied their trade, a peasant, fisherman or coastal villager, who had no financial backing, could be abducted or sold to slave traders, or adversaries, who made large profits on an international market;\n# If the captive was wealthy or had influential supporters, the captive could be ransomed. This would be the most advantageous plan, since the money exchange was immediate and direct, not long and drawn out as in the slave market business;\n# The captive could be used immediately by the corsair for labour on the ship rather than traded. In battles during this era, prisoners of war were often captured and used as slaves.\n\nEmperors would take large numbers of prisoners, parade them through the capital, hold feasts in honour of their capture and parade diplomats in front of them as a display of victory.<ref name=\"Europe and the Islamic World: A History \">{{cite book|author1=Tolan, John |author2=Veinstein, Gilles |author3=Henry Laurens |title=\"Europe and the Islamic World: A History\".|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-14705-5|pages=67\u201368}}</ref>\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n{{further|Maritime republics|Crown of Aragon|Crown of Castile|Ottoman Empire}}\n\n[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|250px|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].]]\nThe \"Repubbliche Marinare\" (Maritime republics) of [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Ancona|Ancona]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] developed their own \"empires\" in the Mediterranean shores. The Islamic states had never been major naval powers, and trade from the east to Europe was soon in the hands of Italian traders, especially the Genoese and the Venetians, who profited immensely from it. The [[Republic of Pisa]] and later the [[Republic of Ragusa]] used diplomacy to further trade and maintained a libertarian approach in civil matters to further sentiment in its inhabitants.\n\nThe [[republic of Venice]] got to dominate the eastern mediterranean shores after the [[Fourth Crusade]].{{Sfn|Banaji|2007|p=62-63}}\n\nBetween 1275 and 1344 a struggle for the control of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] took place. Featuring the [[Marinid Sultanate]], the [[Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], the [[Crown of Castile]], the [[Crown of Arag\u00f3n]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the [[Republic of Genoa]], it was characterized by changing alliances between the main actors.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|1996\u20131997|p=405}} The iberian cities of [[Tarifa]], [[Ceuta]], [[Algeciras]] or [[Ronda]] and the African port of [[Ceuta]] were at stake.{{Sfn|L\u00f3pez|1996\u20131997|p=405}}\nThe Western Mediterranean sea was dominated by the [[Crown of Aragon]]: thanks to their possessions of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Duchy of Athens]] the [[Duchy of Neopatria]], and several northern African cities.\n\nIn 1347 the [[Black Death]] spread from [[Constantinople]] across the mediterranean basin.{{Sfn|Sola|2006|p=46}}\n\nOttoman power continued to grow, and in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was extinguished with the [[fall of Constantinople]]. The Ottomans already controlled Greece, [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and much of the [[Balkans]] and soon also began to spread through North Africa. North Africa had grown wealthy from the trade across the [[Sahara Desert]], but the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who, along with other Christian powers, had been engaged in a long campaign to evict the Muslims from Iberia, had found a method to circumvent this trade by trading directly with [[West Africa]].  This was enabled by a new type of ships, the [[caravel]], that made trade in the rough Atlantic waters profitable for the first time.  The reduction in the Saharan trade weakened North Africa, and made them an easy target for the Ottomans.\n\nCeuta was ultimately taken by the Kingdom of Portugal in 1415, searching to undermine Castilian, Aragonese, and Genoese interests in the area.{{Sfn|Banaji|2007|pp=49; 63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, rival Christian and Muslim kingdoms forbade the trade of particular goods to enemy kingdoms including weaponry and other contraband items. The popes forbade the export of these commodities to the Islamic world. The Ottomans too forbade the export of weapons and other strategic items, declaring them ''memnu e\u015fya'' or ''memnu olan'' to Christian states even in peace treaties, however friendly states could import some of the prohibited goods through [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]]. Despite these prohibitions, trade of contraband occurred on both sides. The European merchants traded in illegal goods with Muslims. The Ottomans were unable to suppress the trade with smuggling being undertaken mainly in the winter when the [[Ottoman Navy]] stationed at the [[Imperial Arsenal|Istanbul Arsenal]] was unable to stop Ottoman and non-Ottoman vessels from indulging in the trade.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|authors=Ga \u0301bor A \u0301goston, Bruce Alan Masters|page=145|publisher=Infobase Publishing}}</ref>\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{further|Ottoman Empire|Portuguese Empire|Spanish Empire|Italian Empire}}\n\n[[File:OttomanEmpireIn1683.png|thumb|250px|[[Ottoman Empire]] territories acquired between 1300 and 1683.]]\n[[File:ItalianMareNostrum.jpg|thumb|250px|Greatest extent of Italian control of the Mediterranean littoral and seas (within green line & dots) in summer/fall 1942. Allied-controlled areas in red.]]\nThe growing naval prowess of the European powers confronted further rapid Ottoman expansion in the region when the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] checked the power of the Ottoman navy. However, as [[Braudel]] argued forcefully, this only slowed the Ottoman expansion instead of ending it. The prized island of [[Cyprus]] became Ottoman in 1571. The last resistance in [[Tunisia]] ended in 1574 and almost a generation long siege in [[Crete]] pushed Venetians out of this strategic island in 1669.\n\nA [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was then established between [[Spain]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] until the 18th century, each dominating their respective half of Mediterranean, reducing Italian navies as naval powers increasingly more irrelevant. Furthermore, the Ottoman Empire had succeeded in their objective of extending Muslim rule across the North African coast.\n\nThe development of long range seafaring had an influence upon the entire Mediterranean. While once all trade from the east had passed through the region, the [[Portuguese discoveries|circumnavigation of Africa]] allowed [[gold]], [[spice]]s, and [[dye]]s to be imported directly to the Atlantic ports of western Europe.  The Americas were also a source of extreme wealth to the western powers, from which some of the Mediterranean states were largely cut off.\n\nThe base of European power thus shifted northward and the once wealthy [[Italy]] became a peripheral area dominated by foreigners.  The Ottoman Empire also began a slow decline that saw its North African possessions gain de facto independence and its European holdings gradually reduced by the increasing power of Austria and Russia.\n\nBy the nineteenth century the European States were vastly more powerful, and began to colonize North Africa.  France spread its power south by taking [[Algeria]] in 1830 and later [[Tunisia]]. Britain gained control of [[Egypt]] in 1882. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] conquered [[Libya]] from the Ottomans in 1911. Greece [[Greek War of Independence|achieved independence in 1832]]. The Ottoman Empire finally collapsed in the [[World War I|First World War]], and its holdings were carved up among France and Britain. The [[rump state]] of the wider Ottoman Empire became the independent state of [[Turkey]] in 1923. Yugoslavia was created from the former Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the First World War.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century the Mediterranean was at the center of the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and was one of the main areas of battle during [[World War II]] between the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Post-world war period was marked by increasing activity in the Eastern Mediterranean, where naval actions formed part of ongoing Arab\u2013Israeli conflict and Turkey had [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|occupied the northern part of Cyprus]]. Cold War tensions split the Mediterranean into pro-American and pro-Soviet factions, with Turkey, Greece, Spain, Italy and France being [[NATO]] members. Syria was socialist and a pro-Soviet regime, offering the Soviets [[Tartus|a port for their navy]] from an agreement in 1971. Yugoslavia was Communist but in neither the Soviet nor American camps. Egypt tilted towards the Soviets during the time of [[Nasser]] but then turned towards American influence during the time of [[Sadat]]. Israel and Egypt both received massive American military aid. American naval power made the Mediterranean a base for the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] during the Cold war.\n\nToday, the Mediterranean Sea is the southern border of the [[European Union]] and represents one of the largest area by Trade in the World. The Maltese prime minister described the Mediterranean sea as a \"cemetery\" due to the large amounts of migrants who drown there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/10/migrant-deaths-prompt-calls-eu-action-2013101361646517233.html|title=Migrant deaths prompt calls for EU action|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=13 October 2013|accessdate=27 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801061324/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/10/migrant-deaths-prompt-calls-eu-action-2013101361646517233.html|archive-date=1 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Following the [[2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck]], the Italian government, has decided to strengthen the national system for the patrolling of the Mediterranean Sea by authorizing [[Operation Mare Nostrum]], a military and humanitarian operation in order to rescue the migrants and arrest the traffickers of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurasia-rivista.org/loperazione-mare-nostrum/20335/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718050114/http://www.eurasia-rivista.org/loperazione-mare-nostrum/20335/ |archivedate=2014-07-18 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Mediterranean]]\n* [[History of Anatolia]]\n* [[History of North Africa]]\n* [[History of the Levant]]\n* [[History of Western civilization]]\n* [[Life zones of the Mediterranean region]]\n* [[Mediterranean Basin]]\n* [[Union for the Mediterranean]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{Cite journal|journal=[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]]|volume=15|year=2007|pages=47\u201374|title=Islam, the Mediterranean and the Rise of Capitalism|first=Jairus|last=Banaji|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/15983/1/Islam%20and%20capitalism.pdf|location=Leiden|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Koninklijke Brill]]|issn=1465-4466}}\n* {{Cite journal|title=De nuevo sobre la \"guerra del Estrecho\" la contribuci\u00f3n financiera del reino de Valencia en la \u00faltima fase del conflicto (1332\u20131344)|first=Mar\u00eda Dolores|last=L\u00f3pez|journal=Anales de la Universidad de Alicante.
