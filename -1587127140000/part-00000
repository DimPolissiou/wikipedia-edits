The new [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] was created along with the [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China]].  Sun is credited for the funding of the revolutions and for keeping the spirit of revolution alive, even after a series of failed uprisings.

In order to hasten the conquest of China, he began a policy of active cooperation with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC).

In modern China, liver cancer is far more common than gallbladder cancer and although the incidence rates of either in 1925 are not known, if one assumes that they were similar at that time, then the original diagnosis by Taylor was a logical conclusion.

In 1927 Chiang Kai-shek married [[Soong Mei-ling]], a sister of Sun's widow [[Soong Ching-ling]], and subsequently he could claim to be a brother-in-law of Sun. When the [[12 April Incident|Communists and the Kuomintang split]] in 1927, marking the start of the [[Chinese Civil War]], each group claimed to be his true heirs, a conflict that continued through World War II.  Sun's widow, [[Soong Ching-ling]], sided with the Communists during the Chinese Civil War and served from 1949 to 1981 as Vice-President (or Vice-Chairwoman) of the People's Republic of China and as Honorary President shortly before her death in 1981.\n\n=== Cult of personality ===\nA [[personality cult]] in the Republic of China was centered on Sun and his successor, [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Chinese Muslim Generals and Imams participated in this cult of personality and [[One-party state|one party state]], with Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]] making people bow to Sun's portrait and listen to the national anthem during a [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan]] and [[Mongol]] religious ceremony for the [[Qinghai Lake]] God.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&dq=ma+bufang+son&q=genocidal#v=snippet&q=ma%20bufang%20lake%20god%20scarves&f=false|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=51|isbn=0-7425-1144-8|accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> Quotes from the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] were used among [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims to justify Chiang Kai-shek's rule over China.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&pg=PA135&dq=china+jihad+japan+xue+chengda#v=snippet&q=jiang%20hadith%20jieshi%20leader&f=false|title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication |author1= St\u00e9phane A.

After his death, the Kuomintang opted to keep that language in its constitution to honor his memory forever.  The party has since been headed by a director-general (1927\u20131975) and a chairman (since 1975), which discharge the functions of the president.\n\n=== Father of the Nation ===\n[[File:Sun-jat-sen nanjing 140883.jpg|thumb|Statue in the Mausoleum, [[Kuomintang]] flag on the ceiling]]\n\nSun Yat-sen remains unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for having a high reputation both in [[mainland China]] and in [[Taiwan]]. In Taiwan, he is seen as the Father of the [[Republic of China]], and is known by the [[posthumous name]] ''[[Father of the Nation]], Mr. Sun Zhongshan'' ({{zh|t=\u570b\u7236\u3000\u5b6b\u4e2d\u5c71\u5148\u751f|links=no}}, where the [[Tai tou|one-character space]] is a traditional homage symbol).<ref name=\"sunbook2\" /> His likeness is still almost always found in ceremonial locations such as in front of legislatures and classrooms of public [[Education in Taiwan|schools]], from elementary to senior high school, and he continues to appear in new [[New Taiwan dollar|coinage and currency]].\n\n=== \"Forerunner of the revolution\" ===\nOn the [[mainland China|mainland]], Sun is seen as a Chinese nationalist, proto-socialist, first president of a Republican China and is highly regarded as the ''Forerunner of the Revolution'' ({{lang|zh|\u9769\u547d\u5148\u884c\u8005}}).<ref name=\"Tung1\" /> He is even mentioned by name in the [[:wikisource:Constitution of the People's Republic of China|preamble]] to the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]]. In recent years, the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] has increasingly invoked Sun, partly as a way of bolstering [[Chinese nationalism]] in light of [[Chinese economic reform]] and partly to increase connections with supporters of the Kuomintang on Taiwan which the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] sees as allies against [[Taiwan independence]]. [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|Sun's tomb]] was one of the first stops made by the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] on their [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|pan-blue visit to mainland China in 2005]].<ref>Rosecrance, Richard N.

The new [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] was created along with the [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China]].  Sun is credited for the funding of the revolutions and for keeping the spirit of revolution alive, even after a series of failed uprisings. His successful merger of minor revolutionary groups to a single larger party provided a better base for all those who shared the same ideals.

In order to hasten the conquest of China, he began a policy of active cooperation with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC).

The autopsy was performed immediately after Sun's death by James Cash, a pathologist at PUMCH. Based on a [[Sampling (medicine)|tissue sample]], Cash concluded that the cause of death was an [[adenocarcinoma]] in the [[gallbladder]] that had [[Metastasis|metastasized]] to the liver. In modern China, liver cancer is far more common than gallbladder cancer and although the incidence rates of either in 1925 are not known, if one assumes that they were similar at that time, then the original diagnosis by Taylor was a logical conclusion. From the time of Sun's death until the appearance of Barth's report<ref name=\"barth:5\" /> in the ''[[Chinese Journal of Cancer]]'' in September 2016 (now known as ''Cancer Communications<ref>{{cite web |title=Cancer Communications |url=http://cancercommun.com/ |accessdate= 10 July 2018 |ref=http://cancercommun.com/}}</ref>'' since 1 March 2018), the true cause of death of Sun Yat-sen was not reported in any English-language publication.

At stake in this struggle was the right to lay claim to Sun's ambiguous legacy. In 1927 Chiang Kai-shek married [[Soong Mei-ling]], a sister of Sun's widow [[Soong Ching-ling]], and subsequently he could claim to be a brother-in-law of Sun. When the [[12 April Incident|Communists and the Kuomintang split]] in 1927, marking the start of the [[Chinese Civil War]], each group claimed to be his true heirs, a conflict that continued through World War II.  Sun's widow, [[Soong Ching-ling]], sided with the Communists during the Chinese Civil War and served from 1949 to 1981 as Vice-President (or Vice-Chairwoman) of the People's Republic of China and as Honorary President shortly before her death in 1981.\n\n=== Cult of personality ===\nA [[personality cult]] in the Republic of China was centered on Sun and his successor, [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Chinese Muslim Generals and Imams participated in this cult of personality and [[One-party state|one party state]], with Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]] making people bow to Sun's portrait and listen to the national anthem during a [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan]] and [[Mongol]] religious ceremony for the [[Qinghai Lake]] God.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&dq=ma+bufang+son&q=genocidal#v=snippet&q=ma%20bufang%20lake%20god%20scarves&f=false|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=51|isbn=0-7425-1144-8|accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> Quotes from the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] were used among [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims to justify Chiang Kai-shek's rule over China.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&pg=PA135&dq=china+jihad+japan+xue+chengda#v=snippet&q=jiang%20hadith%20jieshi%20leader&f=false|title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication |author1= St\u00e9phane A.

After his death, the Kuomintang opted to keep that language in its constitution to honor his memory forever.  The party has since been headed by a director-general (1927\u20131975) and a chairman (since 1975), which discharge the functions of the president.\n\n=== Father of the Nation ===\n[[File:Sun-jat-sen nanjing 140883.jpg|thumb|Statue in the Mausoleum, [[Kuomintang]] flag on the ceiling]]\n\nSun Yat-sen remains unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for having a high reputation both in [[mainland China]] and in [[Taiwan]]. In Taiwan, he is seen as the Father of the [[Republic of China]], and is known by the [[posthumous name]] ''[[Father of the Nation]], Mr. Sun Zhongshan'' ({{zh|t=\u570b\u7236\u3000\u5b6b\u4e2d\u5c71\u5148\u751f|links=no}}, where the [[Tai tou|one-character space]] is a traditional homage symbol).<ref name=\"sunbook2\" /> His likeness is still almost always found in ceremonial locations such as in front of legislatures and classrooms of public [[Education in Taiwan|schools]], from elementary to senior high school, and he continues to appear in new [[New Taiwan dollar|coinage and currency]].\n\n=== \"Forerunner of the revolution\" ===\nOn the [[mainland China|mainland]], Sun is seen as a Chinese nationalist, proto-socialist, first president of a Republican China and is highly regarded as the ''Forerunner of the Revolution'' ({{lang|zh|\u9769\u547d\u5148\u884c\u8005}}).<ref name=\"Tung1\" /> He is even mentioned by name in the [[:wikisource:Constitution of the People's Republic of China|preamble]] to the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]]. In recent years, the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] has increasingly invoked Sun, partly as a way of bolstering [[Chinese nationalism]] in light of [[Chinese economic reform]] and partly to increase connections with supporters of the Kuomintang on Taiwan which the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] sees as allies against [[Taiwan independence]]. [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|Sun's tomb]] was one of the first stops made by the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] on their [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|pan-blue visit to mainland China in 2005]].<ref>Rosecrance, Richard N.

By the age of 10, he had passed the audition for the Mitchell Boys Choir (founded by [[Bob Mitchell]]) in Hollywood, California where he studied music theory from 1974 to 1981. In 1977, whilst still attending the Mitchell Boys, he performed vocals on composer [[Ennio Morricone]]\u2019s [[Exorcist II: The Heretic]] soundtrack as well as contributing to the made for TV American movie [[The Possessed (1977 film)]] directed by [[Jerry Thorpe]]. In 1981 he performed and appeared in the Universal pic [[All Night Long (1981 film)]] starring [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Gene Hackman]] During this period, Darling also performed in [[La boh\u00e8me]] at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Musical Career==\nIn 1985, Darling formed his first band [[Antix (band)]] using his Greg Clewley family name. The band signed to [[Enigma Records]] and released the mini-album Get Up, Get Happy. In 1987, Darling met [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Poison (American band)]] and [[Motley Crue]] manager [[Vicky Hamilton]] who introduced him to producer Bob Rose and American [[Glam metal]]/[[Glam punk]] band [[Faster Pussycat]] who she also managed. Darling subsequently played piano and provided backing vocals for the band\u2019s 1987 [[Faster Pussycat (album)|self-titled debut album]].\nIn 1988 Darling recorded demos with his new band, Darling Cruel, and was offered a record contract by [[George Michael]] who had recently set up his own Mika Records imprint via [[Polygram]]. Soon after this Polygram signed Darling Cruel directly and, later that year, the band recorded their debut album \"Passion Crimes\" at [[Rockfield Studios]] in Monmouth, Wales. A year later Darling Cruel signed to George Michael\u2019s management company, Lippmann/Kahane.<ref name=\"LAtimes\"/>\n\nIn September 1989, Darling Cruel released their debut album \"Passion Crimes\".

New Polygram president [[Alain Levy]] \u2013 champion of [[Rhythm and blues|R \u2018n\u2019 B]] and [[Hip hop music|Rap music]] \u2013 disassociated himself from the new record that was subsequently shelved. In 1991, Darling Cruel toured the US, opening for [[The Moody Blues]] before dismembering. Darling remained with Polygram to co-write with [[Holly Knight]]. Together they produced \"Don\u2019t Like The Way You Look At My Love\" for [[Russ Irwin]], released on [[SBK Records]]. A year later Darling requested to be dropped from the label.\n\nIn 1994 Darling jammed live with [[Prince|Prince (musician)]] in [[Century City]] \u2013 \u201cI was playing a show and this guy comes over to the stage and says \u201cIs it ok if the Artist Formerly Known As Prince comes up to jam? Before you know it, the audience parts, and a little man in a golden suit approaches me walks right up on stage, looks directly at me and says \u2018What key are you in?\u2019 I said \u2018We\u2019re in C\u2019, and he replied \u2018Does your bass player know that?\u2019! I\u2019ll never forget it! My bass player is shaking, he\u2019s terrified. Fortunately, my guitar player recognized this, so he picks up the bass, hands Prince his guitar, and we went off for twenty three minutes on a musical safari, full of chord changes, alternating tempos... an absolutely extraordinary experience <ref name=\"Fireworks\"/> - and a year later he signed a publishing contract with [[Herman Rarebell]]\u2019s Monaco Records. This led to him co-writing five songs (including the title track) and playing piano) on [[Julian Lennon]]\u2019s critically acclaimed album [[Photograph Smile]]. Between 1998 and 2000 Darling embarked on a world tour with Lennon playing piano and providing backing vocals.\n \nIn 2001, Darling worked alongside producer [[Richard Perry]] as arranger and musician for his Baby Genius project before continuing his co-writing work with Julian Lennon at the latter\u2019s Treehouse Studios.

New Polygram president [[Alain Levy]] \u2013 champion of [[Rhythm and blues|R \u2018n\u2019 B]] and [[Hip hop music|Rap music]] \u2013 disassociated himself from the new record that was subsequently shelved. In 1991, Darling Cruel toured the US, opening for [[The Moody Blues]] before dismembering. Darling remained with Polygram to co-write with [[Holly Knight]]. Together they produced \"Don\u2019t Like The Way You Look At My Love\" for [[Russ Irwin]], released on [[SBK Records]]. A year later Darling requested to be dropped from the label.\n\nIn 1994 Darling jammed live with [[Prince|Prince (musician)]] in [[Century City]] \u2013 \u201cI was playing a show and this guy comes over to the stage and says \u201cIs it ok if the Artist Formerly Known As Prince comes up to jam? Before you know it, the audience parts, and a little man in a golden suit approaches me walks right up on stage, looks directly at me and says \u2018What key are you in?\u2019 I said \u2018We\u2019re in C\u2019, and he replied \u2018Does your bass player know that?\u2019! I\u2019ll never forget it! My bass player is shaking, he\u2019s terrified. Fortunately, my guitar player recognized this, so he picks up the bass, hands Prince his guitar, and we went off for twenty three minutes on a musical safari, full of chord changes, alternating tempos... an absolutely extraordinary experience <ref name=\"Fireworks\"/> - and a year later he signed a publishing contract with [[Herman Rarebell]]\u2019s Monaco Records. This led to him co-writing five songs (including the title track) and playing piano) on [[Julian Lennon]]\u2019s critically acclaimed album [[Photograph Smile]]. Between 1998 and 2000 Darling embarked on a world tour with Lennon playing piano and providing backing vocals.\n \nIn 2001, Darling worked alongside producer [[Richard Perry]] as arranger and musician for his Baby Genius project before continuing his co-writing work with Julian Lennon at the latter\u2019s Treehouse Studios. Between 2001 and 2004 he wrote music for DL Music and produced and wrote instrumentals for TV shows [[American Idol]] and Behind The Scenes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist\n| colwidth = 30em\n| refs =\n\n<ref name=\"LAtimes\">\n{{cite web\n| url = https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-04-08-ca-1689-story.html\n| title = The Hot \u2018Tag Team\u2019 of Rock Management : Rob Kahane\u2019s faith in George Michael and Michael Lippman\u2019s belief in record producers\n| last = Hilburn\n| first = Robert\n| website = latimes\n| date = 8 April 1990\n| accessdate = 17 April 2020\n}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MetalHammer\">\n{{cite journal\n| last = Dome\n| first = Malcolm\n| date = 10 July 1989\n| title = Passion Crimes\n| newspaper = [[Metal Hammer]]\n| archivedate = 17 April 2020\n}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Fireworks\">\n{{cite journal\n| last = Gaden\n| first = James\n| date = 1 August 2006\n| title = Passion Crimes\n| newspaper = [[Fireworks (magazine)]]\n| archivedate = 17 April 2020\n}}\n</ref>\n\n}}\n", "name_user": "Raymond80s", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Darling"}
