{"title_page": "Canadian Hockey Association (1909\u201310)", "text_new": "{{Emergence of the NHL}}\nThe '''Canadian Hockey Association (CHA)'''  was an early men's professional [[ice hockey]] league. It was founded in November, 1909, as the result of a dispute within the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association|Eastern Canada Hockey Association]]. The CHA survived only a few weeks of play in January 1910 before two teams jumped to the new [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA), itself a seven-week-old league, causing dissolution of the CHA.\n\nThe CHA held the [[Stanley Cup]] for its entire eight week existence, as the reigning champion [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Hockey Club]] was a founding member.\n\n==History==\nAt the regular annual meeting of the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association|Eastern Canada Hockey Association]], held at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal on November 25, 1909, three teams from the ECHA (Ottawa, [[Quebec Bulldogs|Quebec]], and the [[Montreal Shamrocks]]) resigned and formed the new Canadian Hockey Association. The new league then took applications from other teams including their former partner the [[Montreal Wanderers]] of the ECHA. The three teams had decided to form the new league after the Wanderers were sold to new owners that wanted to move the club to the smaller Jubilee Arena from their former home, the Montreal Arena. The other clubs, most specifically Ottawa, then the Stanley Cup champions, wanted to only play at the Montreal Arena. The CHA then opened their association to applications from other hockey clubs, rejecting applications from Wanderers which did not commit to the Arena, while accepting two other teams: the [[All-Montreal Hockey Club|All-Montreal]], organized by former Wanderers captain [[Art Ross]], and the francophone [[Montreal Le National]].<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=November 26, 1909 |page=8 |title=Ottawa Hockey Club Enters a New Canadian \"Pro\" League}}</ref>\n\nPlay started on December 30. After a few games it was clear that fan interest was not there as only 800 fans were recorded for the game between the Nationals and the Shamrocks. After the January 8 game between All-Montreal and Ottawa, which was attended by only 1500 fans, Art Ross made plans to suspend the All-Montreal team and, along with [[Paddy Moran (ice hockey)|Paddy Moran]], join the [[Haileybury Comets|Haileybury]] team of the NHA. League secretary Emmett Quinn notified the Ottawa team that the situation was hopeless. The Shamrocks announced that they would abandon the league. The CHA owners decided to proceed with an amalgamation with the NHA, entitling the league the \"Canadian-National Hockey League\".<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=January 15, 1910 |page=9 |title=Peace in Pro Hockey World Will Be Restored Today}}</ref>\n\nA meeting with the NHA on January 15, 1910 was planned to consider amalgamation with the CHA, but amalgamation was not discussed. Instead the NHA admitted Ottawa, Quebec, and the Shamrocks. The Le National were offered the franchise of [[Montreal Canadiens|Les Canadiens]], but declined, partly due to the Canadiens' lease with the Jubilee Arena. No invitation was offered to All-Montreal and Quebec. The CHA ceased operations.\n\nDuring its brief season, the Ottawa Hockey Club won a Stanley Cup challenge against [[Galt Professionals|Galt HC]], champions of the [[Ontario Professional Hockey League]] (OPHL). For this, and a challenge during the NHA season, the Senators are considered co-champions of the Stanley Cup in 1910.\n\n==Final standing==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10em\" | Team !! style=\"width:2em\" | {{abbr|GP|Games played}}\n! style=\"width:2em\" | {{abbr|W|Wins}} \n! style=\"width:2em\" | {{abbr|L|Losses}} \n! style=\"width:2em\" | {{abbr|T|Ties}} \n! style=\"width:2em\" | {{abbr|GF|Goals for}} \n! style=\"width:2em\" | {{abbr|GA|Goals against}} \n|-  align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\" | [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Hockey Club]] || 3 || 3 || 0 || 0 || 44 || 12\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\" | [[Quebec Bulldogs]] || 3 || 2 || 1 || 0 || 20 || 22\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\" | [[All-Montreal HC]]  || 4 || 2 || 2 || 0 || 20 || 24\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\" | [[Montreal Shamrocks]]  || 4 || 2 || 2 || 0 || 32 || 33\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\" | [[Montreal Le National]]  || 4 || 0 || 4 || 0 || 25 || 50\n|}\n\n==Season summary==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The county was incorporated on January 10, 1816 and named for [[Andrew Jackson]]. The community of Brownsville served as the fledgling county's first seat.\n\nJackson County is included in the Carbondale-[[Marion, Illinois|Marion]], IL [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. It is located in the southern portion of Illinois known locally as \"[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]\".\n\n==History==\nHuman occupation of Jackson County began about 11,500 years ago. Extensive documentation of the area's [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]] is ongoing. Exploration from the European explorers began with the [[Louis Joliet|Joliet]]-[[Jacques Marquette|Marquette]] exploration along the [[Mississippi River]]. It was not until the 18th and 19th century when pioneer farmers began to settle in the area's inexpensive land along the Mississippi River and in the forested Shawnee hills with its one-hundred-foot trees.\n\nAs early as 1810 William Boone and his indentured servant Peter mined coal from the banks along Big Muddy River. This was Illinois' first coal mine. By 1813, [[Conrad Will (politician)|Conrad Will]], namesake of [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]], conducted a large salt extraction operation using [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor on the banks of the [[Big Muddy River]], south of today's Murphysboro. As this was in the \"free\" [[Northwest Territory]], Will had to have a legal exemption to own slaves.\nJackson County, Illinois' ninth county to be organized, was organized in 1816, having been carved out of Randolph County, Illinois on the north and Johnson County, Illinois on the South. It was named for [[Andrew Jackson]], who had just defeated the [[United Kingdom|British]] Army at the [[Battle of New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|publisher=Govt.

When the courthouse burned in 1843, the county voted to move the county seat to a more central location. Murphysboro, located on land owned by Dr. John and Elizabeth (Jenkins) Logan, became the second county seat in September 1843. It was named after William C. Murphy, one of the three Commissioners appointed to select the site.\n\nCivil War Major General John A. Logan, Dr. John and Elizabeth Logan's son, was born in what is now Murphysboro on February 9, 1826. During the Civil War he moved to Carbondale, about 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) east of his birthplace. He moved to Chicago in 1871. During his residence in Carbondale, he took part in a Memorial Day observation at that city's Woodlawn Cemetery. In 1868, Logan, as Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, issued General Order No. 11 which established Memorial Day as a national holiday.<ref>Eclebarger, Gary, Black Jack Logan: An Extraordinary Life in Peace and War</ref>\n\nOn 18 March 1925, the great [[Tri-State Tornado]] ripped through Jackson County, leaving devastation in its path. The villages of Gorham and DeSoto and the city of Murphysboro were hit especially hard.\n\nThe county courthouse is in downtown Murphysboro. The current reinforced concrete courthouse, completed in 1928, replaced earlier brick structures.\n<gallery>\nFile:Jackson County Illinois 1816.png|Jackson County (1816\u20131818), including unorganized territory (formerly part of Johnson County) temporarily attached to it<ref>White, Jesse.

United States|Southern]]\u201d Southern Illinois culture with the presence in recent times of a strong student body in Carbondale. In its early years Jackson County was solidly Democratic: no Republican was to carry the county until [[Benjamin Harrison]] \u2013 despite losing the 1892 election \u2013 won it from [[Grover Cleveland]]. For the following seven decades Jackson County turned solidly Republican: only [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in his first 1932 election won a majority, and the only other Democratic plurality was that of [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1912 when the Republican Party was mortally divided by Theodore Roosevelt's independent campaign.\n\nThe 1964 election saw Jackson County turn strongly Democratic due to the growth of student opposition to the conservative Republican nominee [[Barry Goldwater]], and this student liberalism was sufficient eight years later to make Jackson County the only county in Illinois to vote for George McGovern over Richard Nixon, and one of five nationwide to vote for McGovern in 1972 and [[Alf Landon]] in 1936.{{efn|The other counties supporting both Landon and McGovern are [[Deuel County, South Dakota|Deuel County]] in McGovern\u2019s home state of South Dakota, [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] and [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk]] in Massachusetts, and [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]] in Michigan.}} [[Ronald Reagan]] did carry Jackson County in both his 1980 and 1984 triumphs, but he remains the last Republican to carry the county, although in common with the rest of Southern Illinois Mitt Romney and Donald Trump made substantial gains on previous GOP performances.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Atlas of US Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The county was incorporated on January 10, 1816 and named for [[Andrew Jackson]]. The community of Brownsville served as the fledgling county's first seat.\n\nJackson County is included in the Carbondale-[[Marion, Illinois|Marion]], IL [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. It is located in the southern portion of Illinois known locally as \"[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]\".\n\n==History==\nHuman occupation of Jackson County began about 11,500 years ago. Extensive documentation of the area's [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]] is ongoing. Exploration from the European explorers began with the [[Louis Joliet|Joliet]]-[[Jacques Marquette|Marquette]] exploration along the [[Mississippi River]]. It was not until the 18th and 19th century when pioneer farmers began to settle in the area's inexpensive land along the Mississippi River and in the forested Shawnee hills with its one-hundred-foot trees.\n\nAs early as 1810 William Boone and his indentured servant Peter mined coal from the banks along Big Muddy River. This was Illinois' first coal mine. By 1813, [[Conrad Will (politician)|Conrad Will]], namesake of [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]], conducted a large salt extraction operation using [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor on the banks of the [[Big Muddy River]], south of today's Murphysboro. As this was in the \"free\" [[Northwest Territory]], Will had to have a legal exemption to own slaves. \nJackson County, Illinois' ninth county to be organized, was organized in 1816, having been carved out of Randolph County, Illinois on the north and Johnson County, Illinois on the South. It was named for [[Andrew Jackson]], who had just defeated the [[United Kingdom|British]] Army at the [[Battle of New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|publisher=Govt.

When the courthouse burned in 1843, the county voted to move the county seat to a more central location. Murphysboro, located on land owned by Dr. John and Elizabeth (Jenkins) Logan, became the second county seat in September 1843. It was named after William C. Murphy, one of the three Commissioners appointed to select the site.\n\nCivil War Major General John A. Logan, Dr. John and Elizabeth Logan's son, was born in what is now Murphysboro on February 9, 1826. During the Civil War he moved to Carbondale, about 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) east of his birthplace. He moved to Chicago in 1871. During his residence in Carbondale, he took part in a Memorial Day observation at that city's Woodlawn Cemetery. In 1868, Logan, as Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, issued General Order No. 11 which established Memorial Day as a national holiday.<ref>Eclebarger, Gary, Black Jack Logan: An Extraordinary Life in Peace and War</ref>\n\nOn 18 March 1925, the great [[Tri-State Tornado]] ripped through Jackson County, leaving devastation in its path. The villages of Gorham and DeSoto and the city of Murphysboro were hit especially hard.\n\nThe county courthouse is in downtown Murphysboro. The current reinforced concrete courthouse, completed in 1928, replaced earlier brick structures. \n<gallery>\nFile:Jackson County Illinois 1816.png|Jackson County (1816\u20131818), including unorganized territory (formerly part of Johnson County) temporarily attached to it<ref>White, Jesse.

United States|Southern]]\u201d Southern Illinois culture with the presence in recent times of a strong student body in Carbondale. In its early years Jackson County was solidly Democratic: no Republican was to carry the county until [[Benjamin Harrison]] \u2013 despite losing the 1892 election \u2013 won it from [[Grover Cleveland]]. For the following seven decades Jackson County turned solidly Republican: only [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in his first 1932 election won a majority, and the only other Democratic plurality was that of [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1912 when the Republican Party was mortally divided by Theodore Roosevelt's independent campaign.\n\nThe 1964 election saw Jackson County turn strongly Democratic due to the growth of student opposition to the conservative Republican nominee [[Barry Goldwater]], and this student liberalism was sufficient eight years later to make Jackson County the only county in Illinois to vote for George McGovern over Richard Nixon, and one of five nationwide to vote for McGovern in 1972 and [[Alf Landon]] in 1936.{{efn|The other counties supporting both Landon and McGovern are [[Deuel County, South Dakota|Deuel County]] in McGovern\u2019s home state of South Dakota, [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] and [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk]] in Massachusetts, and [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]] in Michigan.}} [[Ronald Reagan]] did carry Jackson County in both his 1980 and 1984 triumphs, but he remains the last Republican to carry the county, although in common with the rest of Southern Illinois Mitt Romney and Donald Trump made substantial gains on previous GOP performances.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Atlas of US Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!
