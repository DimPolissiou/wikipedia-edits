Located on the former [[U.S. Route 66]], the [[ghost town]] sits on the [[Texas]]\u2013[[New Mexico]] state line. It includes the '''Glenrio Historic District''' which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2007.\n\nThe community was founded in 1903 as a railroad siding on the [[Rock Island Railroad]]. Its name is derived from [[Scots language|Scots]] \"[[glen]]\" + [[Spanish language|Spanish]] \"[[wikt:rio|rio]]\" (meaning \"river\").\n\n==History==\nOriginally a railroad town, the village was renamed from ''Rock Island'' to ''Glenrio'' by the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in 1908 and began receiving motorists on the dusty [[Ozark Trail (auto trail)|Ozark Trail]] in 1917. Its original structures were adobe buildings. The circa-1910 Angel House was in New Mexico.\n\nThe Ozark Trail was formed into [[U.S. Route 66]] on November 11, 1926. By the 1930s, [[U.S. Route 66 in Texas]] was a paved two-lane road served locally by several [[filling station]]s, a [[restaurant]], and a [[motel]]. The road was widened in the 1950s. A [[Texaco]] station (1950) and a [[diner]] (Brownlee Diner/Little Juarez Caf\u00e9, 1952) were constructed in Texas using the [[art moderne]] architectural style.<ref name=\"amglobe\">{{cite news |author=Josh Burton |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/040107/new_7204588.shtml |title=Glenrio resurrected |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2012-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525212653/http://amarillo.com/stories/040107/new_7204588.shtml |archive-date=2016-05-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe location of Glenrio on Texas and New Mexico's border led to some interesting business practices. At one point, all fuel was dispensed in Texas due to New Mexico's higher gasoline taxes. The 1930s State Line Bar and motel were built in New Mexico because Deaf Smith County, Texas, was [[dry county|dry]] at the time.<ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/glenrio_historic_district.html |title=Glenrio Historic District-Route 66: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary |publisher=US [[National Park Service]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-04}}</ref> The railroad station was in Texas. The local post office, built circa-1935, was in New Mexico. A water tank and windmill in New Mexico were constructed circa 1945.\n\nThe Joseph Brownlee House, constructed in [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]] in 1930, was moved to Glenrio in 1950. Glenrio was the site of the \"First Motel in Texas\" / \"Last Motel in Texas\" (Homer Ehresman's family-run 1953 State Line Caf\u00e9 and Gas Station and 1955 Texas Longhorn Motel, closed in 1976) and other businesses which straddled the state line on U.S. Route 66 for many years until Interstate 40 bypassed the community in September 1973.<ref name=\"amglobe\"/>\n\nThree [[filling station]]s (the 1925 Broyles Mobil station, a circa-1935 Texaco, and the 1946 Ferguson Gas Station) once operated in New Mexico.\n\nIt went in to decline during 1975 when [[Interstate 40]] had bypassed the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/glenrio_historic_district.html|title=Glenrio Historic District--Route 66: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>  \n\nFor years there has been a simmering dispute over which state the east part of Glenrio is lawfully a part of: Texas or New Mexico?  The straight north-south border between the two states was originally defined as the [[103rd meridian west|103rd meridian]], but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between {{convert|2.29|and|3.77|mi|km}} too far west of that line, making the current towns of [[Farwell, Texas|Farwell]], [[Texline, Texas|Texline]] and the east part of Glenrio appear to be within the State of Texas.  New Mexico's short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was surveyed on the correct meridian.  New Mexico's draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended.  The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable [[oilfields]] of the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]].  A bill was passed in the [[New Mexico Senate]] to fund and file a lawsuit in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law.  Today, land in the strip is included in Texas land surveys and the land and towns (the east part of Glenrio) for all purposes are taxed and governed by the State of Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/1357432.html|title=Border War Brewing?|author=Daniel Gertson|accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\nGlenrio sits just a few yards to the south of [[Interstate 40]] at Texas exit 0 on [[Interstate 40 Business (Glenrio, Texas)|Business I-40]], a road which turns into a local gravel road at the state line.  This was the original Route 66 alignment between Glenrio and San Jon until 1952 and was paved for many years until Quay County removed the paving due to maintenance costs. Mail was formerly served by a post office on the New Mexico side of the town.\n\nThe town consists of the remains of the courtyard motel and related Texas Longhorn Caf\u00e9 and [[Phillips 66]] service station, the post office, a few other buildings including the diner and adjacent Texaco service station, the old Route 66 roadbed, and the former roadbed of the Rock Island Railroad, whose tracks were removed in the 1980s. A few homes still exist in Glenrio; the Joseph Brownlee House and an office in the Texas Longhorn Motel were the last to be occupied.\n\n===Glenrio Historic District===\n'''Glenrio Historic District''' is a {{convert|31.7|acre|adj=on}} [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] that was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2007.<ref name=nris/>  At the time of the listing, the district included 12 [[contributing buildings]] and 4 other [[contributing structures]].\n\n===Glenrio Welcome Center===\nOn June 25, 2008, the State of New Mexico opened the Glenrio Welcome Center on [[Interstate 40]] at the Texas state line. The center includes such things as a pet walk, a livestock corral, [[Wi-Fi|wireless Internet access]], a movie theater, and information kiosks. Built to accommodate one million visitors per year, it includes green features such as recycling of [[greywater]] for grounds [[irrigation]], and a [[wind turbine]] that will generate 20 percent of the center's energy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.qcsunonline.com/news/new_6208___article.html/center_glenrio.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715133646/http://www.qcsunonline.com/news/new_6208___article.html/center_glenrio.html|url-status=dead|title=Glenrio Welcome Center officially opened|archivedate=July 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/main/2008/07/03/abqnewsseeker/915am-e-coli-found-at-new-glenrio-welcome-center.html |title=E.

in the United States. Located on the former [[U.S. Route 66]], the [[ghost town]] sits on the [[Texas]]\u2013[[New Mexico]] state line. It includes the '''Glenrio Historic District''' which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2007.\n\nThe community was founded in 1903 as a railroad siding on the [[Rock Island Railroad]]. Its name is derived from [[Scots language|Scots]] \"[[glen]]\" + [[Spanish language|Spanish]] \"[[wikt:rio|rio]]\" (meaning \"river\").\n\n==History==\nOriginally a railroad town, the village was renamed from ''Rock Island'' to ''Glenrio'' by the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in 1908 and began receiving motorists on the dusty [[Ozark Trail (auto trail)|Ozark Trail]] in 1917. Its original structures were adobe buildings. The circa-1910 Angel House was in New Mexico.\n\nThe Ozark Trail was formed into [[U.S. Route 66]] on November 11, 1926. By the 1930s, [[U.S. Route 66 in Texas]] was a paved two-lane road served locally by several [[filling station]]s, a [[restaurant]], and a [[motel]]. The road was widened in the 1950s. A [[Texaco]] station (1950) and a [[diner]] (Brownlee Diner/Little Juarez Caf\u00e9, 1952) were constructed in Texas using the [[art moderne]] architectural style.<ref name=\"amglobe\">{{cite news |author=Josh Burton |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/040107/new_7204588.shtml |title=Glenrio resurrected |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2012-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525212653/http://amarillo.com/stories/040107/new_7204588.shtml |archive-date=2016-05-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe location of Glenrio on Texas and New Mexico's border led to some interesting business practices. At one point, all fuel was dispensed in Texas due to New Mexico's higher gasoline taxes. The 1930s State Line Bar and motel were built in New Mexico because Deaf Smith County, Texas, was [[dry county|dry]] at the time.<ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/glenrio_historic_district.html |title=Glenrio Historic District-Route 66: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary |publisher=US [[National Park Service]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-04}}</ref> The railroad station was in Texas. The local post office, built circa-1935, was in New Mexico. A water tank and windmill in New Mexico were constructed circa 1945.\n\nThe Joseph Brownlee House, constructed in [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]] in 1930, was moved to Glenrio in 1950. Glenrio was the site of the \"First Motel in Texas\" / \"Last Motel in Texas\" (Homer Ehresman's family-run 1953 State Line Caf\u00e9 and Gas Station and 1955 Texas Longhorn Motel, closed in 1976) and other businesses which straddled the state line on U.S. Route 66 for many years until Interstate 40 bypassed the community in September 1973.<ref name=\"amglobe\"/>\n\nThree [[filling station]]s (the 1925 Broyles Mobil station, a circa-1935 Texaco, and the 1946 Ferguson Gas Station) once operated in New Mexico.\n\nIt went in to decline during 1975 when [[Interstate 40]] had bypassed the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/glenrio_historic_district.html|title=Glenrio Historic District--Route 66: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>  \n\nFor years there has been a simmering dispute over which state the east part of Glenrio is lawfully a part of: Texas or New Mexico?  The straight north-south border between the two states was originally defined as the [[103rd meridian west|103rd meridian]], but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between {{convert|2.29|and|3.77|mi|km}} too far west of that line, making the current towns of [[Farwell, Texas|Farwell]], [[Texline, Texas|Texline]] and the east part of Glenrio appear to be within the State of Texas.  New Mexico's short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was surveyed on the correct meridian.  New Mexico's draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended.  The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable [[oilfields]] of the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]].  A bill was passed in the [[New Mexico Senate]] to fund and file a lawsuit in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law.  Today, land in the strip is included in Texas land surveys and the land and towns (the east part of Glenrio) for all purposes are taxed and governed by the State of Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/1357432.html|title=Border War Brewing?|author=Daniel Gertson|accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\nGlenrio sits just a few yards to the south of [[Interstate 40]] at Texas exit 0 on [[Interstate 40 Business (Glenrio, Texas)|Business I-40]], a road which turns into a local gravel road at the state line.  This was the original Route 66 alignment between Glenrio and San Jon until 1952 and was paved for many years until Quay County removed the paving due to maintenance costs. Mail was formerly served by a post office on the New Mexico side of the town.\n\nThe town consists of the remains of the courtyard motel and related Texas Longhorn Caf\u00e9 and [[Phillips 66]] service station, the post office, a few other buildings including the diner and adjacent Texaco service station, the old Route 66 roadbed, and the former roadbed of the Rock Island Railroad, whose tracks were removed in the 1980s. A few homes still exist in Glenrio; the Joseph Brownlee House and an office in the Texas Longhorn Motel were the last to be occupied.\n\n===Glenrio Historic District===\n'''Glenrio Historic District''' is a {{convert|31.7|acre|adj=on}} [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] that was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2007.<ref name=nris/>  At the time of the listing, the district included 12 [[contributing buildings]] and 4 other [[contributing structures]].\n\n===Glenrio Welcome Center===\nOn June 25, 2008, the State of New Mexico opened the Glenrio Welcome Center on [[Interstate 40]] at the Texas state line. The center includes such things as a pet walk, a livestock corral, [[Wi-Fi|wireless Internet access]], a movie theater, and information kiosks. Built to accommodate one million visitors per year, it includes green features such as recycling of [[greywater]] for grounds [[irrigation]], and a [[wind turbine]] that will generate 20 percent of the center's energy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.qcsunonline.com/news/new_6208___article.html/center_glenrio.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715133646/http://www.qcsunonline.com/news/new_6208___article.html/center_glenrio.html|deadurl=y|title=Glenrio Welcome Center officially opened|archivedate=July 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/main/2008/07/03/abqnewsseeker/915am-e-coli-found-at-new-glenrio-welcome-center.html |title=E.

Today, the abundance of such temptations leads to [[obesity]] and [[heart disease]].

The publication ''Psychology Today'' later received a significant amount of negative but constructive feedback and criticism following some of Kanazawa's more controversial articles.\n\nOn 6 March 2008, in the article subtitled \"All you need is hate\", he suggested a \"little thought experiment\", asking his readers to ''\"(i)magine that, on September 11, 2001, when the Twin Towers came down, the President of the United States was not George W. Bush, but Ann Coulter. What would have happened then? On September 12, President Coulter would have ordered the US military forces to drop 35 nuclear bombs throughout the Middle East, killing all of our actual and potential enemy combatants, and their wives and children. On September 13, the war would have been over and won, without a single American life lost\"''. He concludes, ''\"(y)es, we need a woman in the White House, but not the one who\u2019s running\"'', suggesting that in his opinion someone like Ann Coulter is preferable.<ref name=\"psychologytoday.com-why-we-are-losing-war\">{{cite web |title=Why we are losing this war |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200803/why-we-are-losing-war |website=Psychology Today |accessdate=30 May 2019 |language=en |date=6 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 January 2010, he posted an article titled ''\"What\u2019s Wrong with Muslims?\"'' In it he claims that Muslim \"are all united in their values and goals by their singular identity of being Muslims\", and that although it may be \"tempting to dismiss these observations\", and \"politically correct and comforting\" to say that terrorists are \u2018extremists\u2019 or \u2018jihadists\u2019, that would be \"factually inaccurate\", he claims.<ref name=\"psychologytoday.com-whats-wrong-with-muslims?-kanazawa\">{{cite web |author1=Satoshi Kanazawa |title=What's Wrong with Muslims? |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201001/what-s-wrong-muslims |website=Psychology Today |publisher=The Scientific Fundamentalist blog |accessdate=30 May 2019 |language=en |date=10 January 2010}}</ref>\nHe further elaborated on his views seven days later, on 17 January, in another article on the same website.

El-Sayed expressed concern that, as he writes, \"the fundamental messages portrayed in the public musings of academics are no different from the crude ramblings of a [[Glenn Beck]] or a [[Rush Limbaugh]], they are many times more damaging\". He explains how \"PhD's and daunting lists of academic publications to their names, academics are perceived to carry the weighty, objective backing of \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cscience\u201d by the lay-public, so bigoted, ignorant opinions on their parts are taken as justification to those who already hold skewed perspectives and hateful opinions about Islam and Muslims\".

It is located in the suburb of Strathmore [[Wellington]], New Zealand. Under the leadership of an Executive Headmaster, the College comprises three schools, the Preparatory School for Years 1 to 6, the Middle School for Years 7 to 10 and the Senior School for Years 11 to 13. Each school has its own Principal and Staff. Scots College is an IB World College.\n\n==History==\nIt was founded as a Presbyterian boys' college in 1916 by Rev Dr [[James Gibb (Presbyterian minister)|James Gibb]] and the Hon [[John Aitken (politician)|John Aitken]] on the current campus of [[Queen Margaret College, Wellington|Queen Margaret College]] in Thorndon, and moved to the present site in Strathmore in 1920. Dr Gibb's vision was the creation of a Christian college that would be independent of the secular state system. It is the 'sister' school of Queen Margaret College in Thorndon, Wellington.\n\nThe college's [[Scotland|Scots]] heritage is reflected in its ceremonies (often involving a piper leading a procession into its hall) and school song. College prefects wear kilts on official occasions and every Friday for chapel. The school tartan is that of the [[Clan Fergusson]]. Permission to wear the tartan was granted by the late Governor General Sir [[Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th Baronet|Charles Fergusson]].\n\nThe Main Block has a Category II listing with the [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]].\n\n==Houses==\n\nStudents in the Middle and Senior Schools (Years 7-13) are organized into eight \"houses\". Each house reflects an important part of the people who have contributed to Scots College over its history. The houses have expanded three times since the founding of the school - two houses were added to the original two in 1961/1963, another two in 1993 with the boarders' house (Gibb) being removed at this time as well, and a further two added in 2009. There are major competitions in swimming, cross-country, music, athletics, and other weekly house sport games, such as hockey and touch rugby. The two original houses were Aitken (Blue, named in honour of founding father [[John Aitken (politician)|Hon John Aitken]]) and Fergusson (Green, named in honour of General [[Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th_Baronet|Sir Charles Fergusson]]), with Glasgow (Red, named in honour of former Headmaster K W R Glasgow) and MacKenzie (Yellow, named in honour of Elsie MacKenzie, Former mistress of the Junios Department of Scots College) being established next, followed by Plimmer (Sky Blue, named in honour of the [[John Plimmer]] and his family, whose four grandchildren were enrolled as boarders in 1916) and Uttley (Black, named in honour of Scots College's first Headmaster Dr George Uttley) in 1993 and Smith (Navy Blue, in honour of Alexander Pringle Smith) and Mawson (Maroon, named in honour of Brigadier John Mawson, a past student and Scots College Old Boys' Association President) established in 2009.\n\nThe Preparatory School (Years 1-6) maintains four houses: Potatau (Blue), Bedding (Green), Macarthur (Red) and McKelvie (Yellow). In 2004 there was an announcement of a change to the current House names in the hopes of giving the Preparatory School a better sense of historical identity; Potatau named after the writer of the School [[haka]], McKelvie named in honour of past parent and Board of Governors member Lynn McKelvie, Bedding names in honour of past student Geoff Bedding and Macarthur named after the first student at Scots College Ian Hannay Macarthur.\n\n==Campus facilities==\nRecent projects on campus have been the science block, opened in 2006 by Nobel Laureate [[Sir Paul Nurse]] and the Aitken (Admin/Reception) block in 2009. Other facilities updated in the last few years include the Leslie Shelly Lecture Theatre and the Information Centre, and an extension to Gibb House, the school's Boarding House. The Hodge Sports Centre (HSC) was opened on 4 November 2011, and the Creative Performing Arts Centre (CPAC) was opened on 2 March 2012.\n\nThe College introduced Flexible Learning environments to its campus during 2017 including a tertiary style 'Hub' offering flexible spaces for teaching, student collaboration and a common room for senior students. Additional new Boarding Houses were opened in 2015 and 2018 to house the growing number of boarding students.\n\nThe school also has [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] World School status and maintains an [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] curriculum from PYP to Diploma. The current IB Diploma co-ordinator is Mike McKnight and the MYP co-ordinator is Kate Bondett.\n\n==Boarding==\n\nThe boarding house (titled Gibb House, after the founder of the school) has accommodation for approximately 130 boys. The majority of these students are in Years 9-13 however allowance has been made occasionally for Year 7 and 8 Boys to board full-time. The current boarding director is Gary Henley-Smith, with assistant house masters Malcolm Bradshaw and Marc Capstick, and matrons Tania Steadman and Blossom Cameron. In addition, gap year tutors are lodged in the boarding house and assist with day-to-day operations.\n\nWhen the College's Senior School changed to co-educational in 2020 girls were also able to board at Scots College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotscollege.school.nz/senior-school/co-educational-senior-school/|title=Co-educational Senior School|publisher=Scots College|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Connections with other schools==\nScots College 1st XV is currently playing in the Premier I rugby division. In 2014 the 1st XV won the NZ Secondary School Championship - a joint win with Hamilton Boys High School.  In 2015 they represented New Zealand at the SANIX Rugby Youth Cup tournament in Japan where they placed third.\n\nStudents competing for the 1st XV in traditional fixtures perform a special haka written by an old boy; this is distinct from the school haka.\n\nScots College is the brother school to the slightly younger [[Queen Margaret College (Wellington)|Queen Margaret College]], which now sites itself in the original Scots College building. Often there are various socials and sporting matches against local schools, organised by College Sport Wellington. In addition, both sections of the school have inter-school fixtures with other secondary schools, notably [[Lindisfarne College, New Zealand|Lindisfarne]] and primary schools such as [[Huntley School (New Zealand)|Huntley School]].\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{maincat|People educated at Scots College, Wellington}}\n* [[Steven Adams]] - basketball player for [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]\n* [[Ashley Bloomfield]] - Doctor, Director-General of Health and \"public face\" of 2020 coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand (was Head Prefect) \n* Prof [[Geoffrey Duncan Chisholm]] - surgeon<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/chisholm_geoffrey.pdf|title=Obituary|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|author=J A Strong}}</ref>\n* [[John Clarke (satirist)|John Clarke]] - satirist\n* [[Ralph Francis Alnwick Grey, Baron Grey of Naunton|Lord Grey of Naunton]] - last [[Governor of Northern Ireland]] (also attended [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]])\n* [[Eugenio Pizzuto]] - footballer for [[C.F.

It is located in the suburb of Strathmore [[Wellington]], New Zealand. Under the leadership of an Executive Headmaster, the College comprises three schools, the Preparatory School for Years 1 to 6, the Middle School for Years 7 to 10 and the Senior School for Years 11 to 13. Each school has its own Principal and Staff. Scots College is an IB World College.\n\n==History==\nIt was founded as a Presbyterian boys' college in 1916 by Rev Dr [[James Gibb (Presbyterian minister)|James Gibb]] and the Hon [[John Aitken (politician)|John Aitken]] on the current campus of [[Queen Margaret College, Wellington|Queen Margaret College]] in Thorndon, and moved to the present site in Strathmore in 1920. Dr Gibb's vision was the creation of a Christian college that would be independent of the secular state system. It is the 'sister' school of Queen Margaret College in Thorndon, Wellington.\n\nThe college's [[Scotland|Scots]] heritage is reflected in its ceremonies (often involving a piper leading a procession into its hall) and school song. College prefects wear kilts on official occasions and every Friday for chapel. The school tartan is that of the [[Clan Fergusson]]. Permission to wear the tartan was granted by the late Governor General Sir [[Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th Baronet|Charles Fergusson]].\n\nThe Main Block has a Category II listing with the [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]].\n\n==Houses==\n\nStudents in the Middle and Senior Schools (Years 7-13) are organized into eight \"houses\". Each house reflects an important part of the people who have contributed to Scots College over its history. The houses have expanded three times since the founding of the school - two houses were added to the original two in 1961/1963, another two in 1993 with the boarders' house (Gibb) being removed at this time as well, and a further two added in 2009. There are major competitions in swimming, cross-country, music, athletics, and other weekly house sport games, such as hockey and touch rugby. The two original houses were Aitken (Blue, named in honour of founding father [[John Aitken (politician)|Hon John Aitken]]) and Fergusson (Green, named in honour of General [[Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th_Baronet|Sir Charles Fergusson]]), with Glasgow (Red, named in honour of former Headmaster K W R Glasgow) and MacKenzie (Yellow, named in honour of Elsie MacKenzie, Former mistress of the Junios Department of Scots College) being established next, followed by Plimmer (Sky Blue, named in honour of the [[John Plimmer]] and his family, whose four grandchildren were enrolled as boarders in 1916) and Uttley (Black, named in honour of Scots College's first Headmaster Dr George Uttley) in 1993 and Smith (Navy Blue, in honour of Alexander Pringle Smith) and Mawson (Maroon, named in honour of Brigadier John Mawson, a past student and Scots College Old Boys' Association President) established in 2009.\n\nThe Preparatory School (Years 1-6) maintains four houses: Potatau (Blue), Bedding (Green), Macarthur (Red) and McKelvie (Yellow). In 2004 there was an announcement of a change to the current House names in the hopes of giving the Preparatory School a better sense of historical identity; Potatau named after the writer of the School [[haka]], McKelvie named in honour of past parent and Board of Governors member Lynn McKelvie, Bedding names in honour of past student Geoff Bedding and Macarthur named after the first student at Scots College Ian Hannay Macarthur.\n\n==Campus facilities==\nRecent projects on campus have been the science block, opened in 2006 by Nobel Laureate [[Sir Paul Nurse]] and the Aitken (Admin/Reception) block in 2009. Other facilities updated in the last few years include the Leslie Shelly Lecture Theatre and the Information Centre, and an extension to Gibb House, the school's Boarding House. The Hodge Sports Centre (HSC) was opened on 4 November 2011, and the Creative Performing Arts Centre (CPAC) was opened on 2 March 2012.\n\nThe College introduced Flexible Learning environments to its campus during 2017 including a tertiary style 'Hub' offering flexible spaces for teaching, student collaboration and a common room for senior students. Additional new Boarding Houses were opened in 2015 and 2018 to house the growing number of boarding students.\n\nThe school also has [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] World School status and maintains an [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] curriculum from PYP to Diploma. The current IB Diploma co-ordinator is Mike McKnight and the MYP co-ordinator is Kate Bondett.\n\n==Boarding==\n\nThe boarding house (titled Gibb House, after the founder of the school) has accommodation for approximately 130 boys. The majority of these students are in Years 9-13 however allowance has been made occasionally for Year 7 and 8 Boys to board full-time. The current boarding director is Gary Henley-Smith, with assistant house masters Malcolm Bradshaw and Marc Capstick, and matrons Tania Steadman and Blossom Cameron. In addition, gap year tutors are lodged in the boarding house and assist with day-to-day operations.\n\nWhen the College's Senior School changed to co-educational in 2020 girls were also able to board at Scots College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotscollege.school.nz/senior-school/co-educational-senior-school/|title=Co-educational Senior School|publisher=Scots College|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Connections with other schools==\nScots College 1st XV is currently playing in the Premier I rugby division. In 2014 the 1st XV won the NZ Secondary School Championship - a joint win with Hamilton Boys High School.  In 2015 they represented New Zealand at the SANIX Rugby Youth Cup tournament in Japan where they placed third.\n\nStudents competing for the 1st XV in traditional fixtures perform a special haka written by an old boy; this is distinct from the school haka.\n\nScots College is the brother school to the slightly younger [[Queen Margaret College (Wellington)|Queen Margaret College]], which now sites itself in the original Scots College building. Often there are various socials and sporting matches against local schools, organised by College Sport Wellington. In addition, both sections of the school have inter-school fixtures with other secondary schools, notably [[Lindisfarne College, New Zealand|Lindisfarne]] and primary schools such as [[Huntley School (New Zealand)|Huntley School]].\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{maincat|People educated at Scots College, Wellington}}\n* [[Steven Adams]] - basketball player for [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]\n* [[Sarpreet Singh]] - footballer for [[Bayern Munich II]]\n* [[Eugenio Pizzuto]] - footballer for [[C.F.

The objective was to design and develop a car that would be substantially lighter than any other vehicles in its class (to compensate for the fact that standard all-wheel drive was around {{Convert|100|kg|0|abbr=on}} heavier than competitors' rear-wheel drive). In the late 1980s, it was decided that the target vehicle would be a successor to the V8 (Typ 4C) flagship introduced in 1988. By 1990, a final design by Chris Bird and [[Dirk van Braeckel]] was chosen and frozen for series production in mid-1991. In September 1993, the Audi Space Frame (ASF) Concept was unveiled at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1993|1993 Frankfurt Motor Show]] (IAA) as a D2 Typ 4D prototype in polished aluminum. Pilot production began in December 1993 and development ended in early 1994, at a total cost of $700 million (\u00a3418.1 million).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bh_Wu6YjLMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22N.+Anyadike%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WeR5UbufJajk2AXa2IHgDg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Aluminium|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Introduction ===\nThe Audi A8 (''Typ'' 4D) was presented in February 1994 and debuted at the [[Geneva Auto Show#1994|1994 Geneva Auto Show]] in March, with full-scale factory production commencing in June 1994,<ref name=ETKA>[[ETKA]] official factory data</ref>{{Clarify|date=April 2010|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.Use {{tl|Cite web}} or similar to provide source details.}} although it was not until October 1996, for the 1997 [[model year]] that it became available in North America.

The [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] was offered in both the A8 (standard wheelbase), and the A8 L extended or long-[[wheelbase]] (LWB) version. The A8 L adds {{convert|5|in|0}} of rear legroom.

The FWD models are powered by a [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#2.8V6-24v|2.8-litre V6 engine]], producing {{convert|142|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, and a 3.7-litre [[V8 engine]] producing {{convert|169|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, while the quattro received a [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#4.2 V8 32v 206-220kW|4.2-litre V8]] producing {{convert|221|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe A8 is available with standard luxury amenities, including dual-zone [[climate control]], wood and leather interior trim, 14-way power and heated seats, and an enhanced [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] audio system.\n\nIn 1999, Audi's flagship received [[side curtain airbag]]s, new colours, and restructuring of option packages. The North American \"warm weather package\" added a solar [[sunroof#Sunroof Types|sunroof]] which allows the interior ventilation fans to run, keeping the interior cool while the car is parked with the engine turned off. Changes to all models included a larger passenger-side mirror, and a [[first aid kit]] located in the rear centre armrest.\n\nIn 1999 for the 2000 [[model year]] came a minor front-end restyle, with new, larger, clear [[headlamp|headlights]], a revised grille, and lower front valance with standard projection fog lamps. On the interior, the seats received a new, horizontal stitch pattern. Also, the [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#3.7V8-32v|3.7-litre V8]] FWD model was dropped, leaving the 2.8 V6 model and the long-wheelbase and short-wheelbase 4.2-litre quattro. These restyled cars also featured revised external door handles and an integrated radio antenna. For 2000, the North American A8 line-up was expanded to include the A8 L.\n\nIn 2001, Audi introduced its new [[W12 engine]], a compact [[Volkswagen Group W12 engine|6.0-litre unit]] developed by effectively mating two [[VR6 engine]]s together at the crankshaft. The engine quickly became available in the A8, though only to European and Asian customers. From its introduction through its discontinuation in 2003, only 750 of the D2 \"W12\" models were produced. 2001 also marked the debut of the high-performance S8 variant in North American markets.\n\nIn 2002, the A8 L received standard [[xenon arc lamp|xenon]] [[high-intensity discharge lamp]] (HID) headlights, and a heated steering wheel. A [[tire pressure monitoring system|tyre pressure monitoring system]] (TPMS), an updated Symphony II stereo, and new exterior colours were also added. For 2002, all A8 variants received a trunk/boot interior release lever to facilitate escape in the event an individual became trapped within.\n\nFactory production of this generation ceased at Number 105,092<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audiworld.com/news/02/080402/content.shtml|title=Audi A8 Number 105,092 Initiates Change of Generation - AudiWorld|work=AudiWorld|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref> on August 4, 2002.<ref name=ETKA/>\n\n=== Coup\u00e9 (prototype) ===\nIn 1997, [[IVM Automotive]] of Munich, Germany built a two-door Audi A8 Coup\u00e9. The car was unveiled at the 1997 [[Salon International de l'Auto|Geneva Motor Show]]. Audi contracted IVM to build the [[prototype]], and was considering production of the vehicle. The [[coup\u00e9]] had a re-engineered aluminium body, shorter than the production A8 saloon. Like the [[Mercedes-Benz CL-Class]], there was no central \"B\" pillar, giving the car a seamless design with a gradually sloping roofline. The car included custom leather seats which could seat four. Ultimately, Audi decided not to put the A8 Coup\u00e9 into production, citing lower-than-expected sales figures for the similar [[BMW 8 Series (E31)]] and [[Mercedes-Benz CL-Class#C140|Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coup\u00e9]]. Only one A8 Coup\u00e9 was ever built. The single prototype, painted in a colour called \"Ming Blue pearl\", remains the property of IVM Automotive, and resides in Munich.

The S8 followed the naming convention of other high-performance [[Audi S and RS models|Audi \"S\" models]] such as the [[Audi A6]]-derived S6 and was similar in vein of [[Mercedes-Benz AMG]] models. In markets such as the UK, the S8 was only available with the automatic transmission. Cosmetically, Audi differentiated the S8 from the A8 with solid aluminium alloy door mirror housings, chrome-effect beltline and lower front grille trim, and polished twin exhaust pipes, along with subtle \"S8\" badging. 14-way power adjustable and heated sports front seats with memory function were fitted as were heated rear seats. Standard [[alloy wheel]]s were 18-inch cast [[aluminium alloy]] \"Avus\" six-spoke style. After the 1999 facelift, 20-inch polished nine-spoke RS wheels became an option. In 2002, 18-inch nine-spoke RS wheels became a no-cost option.\n\nAt the same time of the A8's facelift in late 1999, the S8 received the same cosmetic upgrades. This update marked the release of the S8 to the North American market. Production of the D2 series S8 ended in September 2002.\n\nThe D2 series S8 featured an uprated, {{convert|250|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} version of the 4.2-litre V8 with four valves per cylinder. From late 1999, Audi increased this to five valves per cylinder with power increased to {{convert|265|kW|hp|0}} and {{convert|430|Nm|lbft|0}}. From launch in 1996, European-market models came standard with a six-speed manual transmission. A sports-recalibrated version of the [[ZF 5HP24 transmission|ZF ''5HP24'']] five-speed [[tiptronic]] automatic, featuring \"Dynamic Shift Programme\" (DSP) was released a year later and was the only transmission available in most other markets.\n\nA retuned, {{convert|20|mm|in|1|adj=on}} lowered sports suspension included a 30 percent stiffer spring rate and 40 percent more compression damping in the [[shock absorber]]s. Speed-sensitive \"[[servotronic]]\" power assisted steering was also standard.\n\nThe brakes featured [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] 5.3 [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), with [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] (EBD), and worked radially ventilated front [[disc brake|discs]]. From 2002, an upgraded Bosch 5.7 [[electronic stability control|electronic stability programme]] became standard fitment.\n\n=== Engines ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Engine\n!rowspan=2|Power Torque at rpm\n!rowspan=2|0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h<br><small>(0\u201362&nbsp;mph)</small>\n!rowspan=2|Top speed\n|-\n!Displacement\n!Year\n!Type\n|-\n|2.8 (2771&nbsp;cc) || 1994\u20132002 || [[V6 engine|V6]] || {{convert|174|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}};

The model was longer than the previous generation, with room for four or five large adult occupants in the cabin, depending on rear seat configuration. The D3 development program began in 1996, with the design process commencing in Ingolstadt in 1997. The whole Audi design studio based in Ingolstadt first contributed sketch proposals, from which numerous different themes emerged. Six of them were developed into full size clay models and worked up in a traditional manner adjacent to full size tape drawings. At least three one quarter scale models were produced to explore other design variations.\n\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 225\n| image1 = 2004 Audi A8 (4E) 4.2 quattro sedan (2015-07-14) 02.jpg | caption1= Pre-facelift Audi A8 4.2 quattro\n| image2 = Audi A8 L D3 II.Facelift 20090720 front.JPG\n| image3 = Audi A8 L D3 II.Facelift 20090720 rear.JPG | caption3 = Facelift Audi A8 L 3.0 TDI\n}}\n\nThe six full size exterior clay models were reduced to two in late 1998 and these continued to be refined in parallel for a year. At the end of 1999 the final theme selection was made, by [[Mikl\u00f3s Kov\u00e1cs (automobile designer)|Mikl\u00f3s Kov\u00e1cs]] and Imre Hasanic the main contributing designers. This lengthy development time was in part due to the body being made from aluminium, a material less able to take the small radii of sharp feature lines such as those on the (steel bodied) A4 (B6) designed in 1998.\n\nIn parallel to the exterior design development the interior design was progressed with a total of four full size models produced and the production car's horizontally themed instrument panel design dominant from early on, with Norbert Schneider, Mark Bergold and Enzo Rothfuss the main contributing designers.\n\nGrouping major controls nearer the driver for a more driver focused identity whilst creating a more airy and spacious feel were early priorities for the interior design team was headed by Jurgen Albamonte. This was in part facilitated by the [[Multi Media Interface]] (MMI) designed by Jurgen Schr\u00f6der, that pioneered on the D3 A8 after the [[Audi Avantissimo]] concept car preview, and also by class leading colour and trim from Barbara Kr\u00f6meke and Melinda Jenkins.\n\nUnder the supervision of Dany Garand, during the first half of 2000 exterior and interior clay models were digitized and developed using digital design tools in a supporting, not leading, capacity. The D3 final production design was later frozen in the summer of 2000 for an August 2002 start of production.<ref name=\"cdn\"/>\n\nThe A8 was previewed at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#2001|2001 Frankfurt Motor Show]] by the [[Audi Avantissimo]] concept car. This concept introduced much of the technology later available on the series production A8 D3, including: [[Multi Media Interface]], 6-speed automatic transmission with shift paddles, V8 [[biturbo]] engine (RS6), [[self-levelling suspension|self-levelling]] [[adaptive air suspension]] with [[continuously controlled damping]], [[electric park brake]], [[bi-xenon headlight]]s with static [[Adaptive Front Lighting System (AFS)]] curve headlights, dashboard, driver identification systems with [[fingerprint scanner]].\n\nAs with the previous version, two body variants of the second generation A8 are offered, the A8 (standard, or short wheelbase), and the long-[[wheelbase]] (LWB) A8 L. The A8 L adds {{convert|120|mm|abbr=in}} to the rear legroom and {{convert|11|mm|2|abbr=on}} to the overall height of the car.\n\nFor quattro all wheel drive models, a [[ZF 6HP26 transmission|ZF ''6HP26-A61'']] (lower torque capacity 6HP19 version for 6 cylinder models) six-speed [[tiptronic]] automatic transmission with \"Dynamic Shift Programme\" (DSP) and \"sport\" mode, with optional steering wheel mounted paddle-shifters, is the only transmission offering. Output is transmitted via Audi's [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] generation IV all-wheel drive system using the [[Torsen]] T-1 centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] with a default 50:50 torque split front/rear. If the road conditions change, the purely mechanical Torsen differential responds without any delay; it can divert up to 70 percent of power to the front or rear axles.\n\n=== Innovations ===\n* World premiere of [[Multi Media Interface]] (MMI) in-car [[user interface]] (similar to BMW [[iDrive]])\n* [[Multiplexing|Multiplexed]] high speed [[MOST Bus]] [[optical fiber]] data networks (interconnecting tens of [[microprocessor]]s on common [[bus (computing)|databusses]]), integrated with MMI\n* First Audi with [[Bi-Xenon]] [[HID headlamp]]s for both low and high beam\n* World premiere of static [[Adaptive Front Lighting System (AFS)]] curve headlights (from [[Hella (company)|Hella]])<ref>[http://www.kfztech.de/kfztechnik/elo/licht/Lichttechnik_modern.htm Moderne Lichttechnik] - Kurvenlicht - statisch und dynamisch (AFS)</ref>\n* First Audi with 4-wheel [[adaptive suspension|Adaptive]] [[air suspension|Air Suspension]] and [[Continuous Damping Control]] (CDC)-(Skyhook suspension).\n* First Audi GPS [[automotive navigation system|navigation system]] with [[DVD]] maps\n* First Audi with six-speed automatic transmission (Tiptronic)\n* First Audi featuring [[fingerprint recognition|driver identification system]]\n\nIn 2005, new internal combustion engines became available. For European and Asian market customers, the entry-level 3.0-litre [[V6 engine]] was replaced with a new 3.2-litre unit featuring [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), which it shared with the [[Audi A4#B7|Audi B7 A4]] and [[Audi A6#C6|Audi C6 A6]]. The top-of-the-line W12 version debuted that year. The advantage of the [[W12 engine]] layout is its compact packaging, allowing Audi to build a 12-cylinder sedan with all-wheel drive, whereas a conventional V12 could only have a rear-wheel drive configuration as it would have no space in the engine bay for a differential and other components required to power the front wheels. In fact, Audi's 6.0-litre W12 is actually slightly smaller by overall dimensions than the 4.2-litre V8.<ref name=\"newcartestdrive1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.newcartestdrive.com/review-intro.cfm?Vehicle=2005_Audi_A8&ReviewID=2934 |title= 2005 Audi A8 Review, Prices, Photos |work= New Car Test Drive |date= |accessdate= 2010-10-03 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the added power trains, Audi restyled the D3 platform A8 range slightly in 2005, giving all variants a taller, wider [[trapezoid]]al ''single-frame'' grille. The top-of-the-line [[W12 engine]]d '''W12''' version was the first model to be equipped with this grille; [[V8 engine]]d models were fitted with the new grille the following year.<ref name=\"newcartestdrive1\"/>\n\n[[File:AudiA8BangAndOlufsenTweeterLens.JPG|thumb|The unique, motorized [[Bang & Olufsen]] tweeter in a 2008 Audi A8|alt=]]\n\nThe D3 generation A8 introduced the {{convert|235|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} 4.2-litre [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[V8 engine]] (subsequently uprated to {{convert|240|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}). The engine uses two [[turbocharger]]s and two [[intercooler]]s, with each turbocharger functioning exclusively for one bank of four [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]].\n\nThe adaptive air suspension gives the vehicle clearance a range from its normal 120&nbsp;mm up to 145&nbsp;mm in lift mode and down to 95&nbsp;mm in the ''Autobahn'' mode, which is automatically activated when a speed of more than {{Convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} is maintained for more than 30 seconds.<ref>{{cite book|title=Audi A8 Betriebsanleitung|page=151|chapter=adaptive air suspension|publisher= [[Audi AG]]|year=2008|trans-title=Audi A8 Operating Instructions|language=German}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2005 Audi became the first car maker to offer the 1,000-watt 14-channel [[ICEpower]] sound system option from [[Bang & Olufsen]].<ref>{{cite book| title = Preisliste A8 S8 A8 W12 (633/1512.80.00)|date=October 2006| page=16|language=German| publisher=Audi AG}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/audi-med-indbygget-koncertsal-fra-bo-62966|title=Audi med indbygget koncertsal fra B&O|trans-title=Audi with built in concert hall from B&O|last=Kr\u00f8yer|first=Kent|date=13 March 2005|accessdate=6 November 2014|publisher=Mediehuset Ingeni\u00f8ren A/S|language=Danish}}</ref>\n\n=== 2007 facelift ===\nChanges include:\n* Updated front fascia incorporating Audi's signature single frame full-nose grill.

In the second phase, the warning is followed by light braking, strong enough to win the driver's attention. The third phase initiates autonomous partial braking at a rate of 3&nbsp;m/s\u00b2 (9.8&nbsp;ft/s\u00b2).

The S8 Plus was dialed up to {{Convert|605|hp|kW|abbr=on}} out of the same powerplant as the previous S8, by remapping the turbo boost and fuel delivery of the engine. Additionally, the Carbon Ceramic braking system is standard on the S8 Plus.

The objective was to design and develop a car that would be substantially lighter than any other vehicles in its class (to compensate for the fact that standard all-wheel drive was around {{Convert|100|kg|0|abbr=on}} heavier than competitors' rear-wheel drive). In the late 1980s, it was decided that the target vehicle would be a successor to the V8 (Typ 4C) flagship introduced in 1988. By 1990, a final design by Chris Bird and [[Dirk van Braeckel]] was chosen and frozen for series production in mid-1991. In September 1993, the Audi Space Frame (ASF) Concept was unveiled at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1993|1993 Frankfurt Motor Show]] (IAA) as a D2 Typ 4D prototype in polished aluminum. Pilot production began in December 1993 and development ended in early 1994, at a total cost of $700 million (\u00a3418.1 million).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bh_Wu6YjLMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22N.+Anyadike%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WeR5UbufJajk2AXa2IHgDg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Aluminium|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Introduction ===\nThe Audi A8 (''Typ'' 4D) was presented in February 1994 and debuted at the [[Geneva Auto Show#1994|1994 Geneva Auto Show]] in March, with full-scale factory production commencing in June 1994,<ref name=ETKA>[[ETKA]] official factory data</ref>{{Clarify|date=April 2010|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.Use {{tl|Cite web}} or similar to provide source details.}} although it was not until October 1996, for the 1997 [[model year]] that it became available in North America. Unlike its predecessor, the [[Audi V8]] model, which was built on an existing steel platform, the A8 debuted on the then-new [[Volkswagen Group D platform#D2|Volkswagen Group D2 platform]], an all [[aluminium]] [[monocoque]], marketed as the {{nowrap|\"Audi Space Frame\"}} (ASF), which helped to reduce weight and preserve structural rigidity. The [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] was offered in both the A8 (standard wheelbase), and the A8 L extended or long-[[wheelbase]] (LWB) version. The A8 L adds {{convert|5|in|0}} of rear legroom.

The FWD models are powered by a [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#2.8V6-24v|2.8-litre V6 engine]], producing {{convert|142|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, and a 3.7-litre [[V8 engine]] producing {{convert|169|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, while the quattro received a [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#4.2 V8 32v 206-220kW|4.2-litre V8]] producing {{convert|221|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe A8 is available with standard luxury amenities, including dual-zone [[climate control]], wood and leather interior trim, 14-way power and heated seats, and an enhanced [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] audio system.\n\nIn 1999, Audi's flagship received [[side curtain airbag]]s, new colours, and restructuring of option packages. The North American \"warm weather package\" added a solar [[sunroof#Sunroof Types|sunroof]] which allows the interior ventilation fans to run, keeping the interior cool while the car is parked with the engine turned off. Changes to all models included a larger passenger-side mirror, and a [[first aid kit]] located in the rear centre armrest.\n\nIn 1999 for the 2000 [[model year]] came a minor front-end restyle, with new, larger, clear [[headlamp|headlights]], a revised grille, and lower front valance with standard projection fog lamps. On the interior, the seats received a new, horizontal stitch pattern. Also, the [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#3.7V8-32v|3.7-litre V8]] FWD model was dropped, leaving the 2.8 V6 model and the long-wheelbase and short-wheelbase 4.2-litre quattro. These restyled cars also featured revised external door handles and an integrated radio antenna. For 2000, the North American A8 line-up was expanded to include the A8 L.\n\nIn 2001, Audi introduced its new [[W12 engine]], a compact [[Volkswagen Group W12 engine|6.0-litre unit]] developed by effectively mating two [[VR6 engine]]s together at the crankshaft. The engine quickly became available in the A8, though only to European and Asian customers. From its introduction through its discontinuation in 2003, only 750 of the D2 \"W12\" models were produced. 2001 also marked the debut of the high-performance S8 variant in North American markets.\n\nIn 2002, the A8 L received standard [[xenon arc lamp|xenon]] [[high-intensity discharge lamp]] (HID) headlights, and a heated steering wheel. A [[tire pressure monitoring system|tyre pressure monitoring system]] (TPMS), an updated Symphony II stereo, and new exterior colours were also added. For 2002, all A8 variants received a trunk/boot interior release lever to facilitate escape in the event an individual became trapped within.\n\nFactory production of this generation ceased at Number 105,092<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audiworld.com/news/02/080402/content.shtml|title=Audi A8 Number 105,092 Initiates Change of Generation - AudiWorld|work=AudiWorld|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref> on August 4, 2002.<ref name=ETKA/>\n\n=== Coup\u00e9 (prototype) ===\nIn 1997, [[IVM Automotive]] of Munich, Germany built a two-door Audi A8 Coup\u00e9. The car was unveiled at the 1997 [[Salon International de l'Auto|Geneva Motor Show]]. Audi contracted IVM to build the [[prototype]], and was considering production of the vehicle. The [[coup\u00e9]] had a re-engineered aluminium body, shorter than the production A8 saloon. Like the [[Mercedes-Benz CL-Class]], there was no central \"B\" pillar, giving the car a seamless design with a gradually sloping roofline. The car included custom leather seats which could seat four. Ultimately, Audi decided not to put the A8 Coup\u00e9 into production, citing lower-than-expected sales figures for the similar [[BMW 8 Series (E31)]] and [[Mercedes-Benz CL-Class#C140|Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coup\u00e9]]. Only one A8 Coup\u00e9 was ever built. The single prototype, painted in a colour called \"Ming Blue pearl\", remains the property of IVM Automotive, and resides in Munich. Its last public appearance was in 2002 on a series of test drives.{{Clear}}\n\n=== S8 ===\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1 = Audi S8 D2 (Typ 4D) (3962439095).jpg\n| image2 = Audi S8 schwarz hl 1024x768.jpg\n| caption2 = Facelift Audi S8\n}}\n\nAudi introduced the S8 4.2 quattro into the European market in 1996. The S8 followed the naming convention of other high-performance [[Audi S and RS models|Audi \"S\" models]] such as the [[Audi A6]]-derived S6 and was similar in vein of [[Mercedes-Benz AMG]] models. In markets such as the UK, the S8 was only available with the automatic transmission. Cosmetically, Audi differentiated the S8 from the A8 with solid aluminium alloy door mirror housings, chrome-effect beltline and lower front grille trim, and polished twin exhaust pipes, along with subtle \"S8\" badging. 14-way power adjustable and heated sports front seats with memory function were fitted as were heated rear seats. Standard [[alloy wheel]]s were 18-inch cast [[aluminium alloy]] \"Avus\" six-spoke style. After the 1999 facelift, 20-inch polished nine-spoke RS wheels became an option. In 2002, 18-inch nine-spoke RS wheels became a no-cost option.\n\nAt the same time of the A8's facelift in late 1999, the S8 received the same cosmetic upgrades. This update marked the release of the S8 to the North American market. Production of the D2 series S8 ended in September 2002.\n\nThe D2 series S8 featured an uprated, {{convert|250|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} version of the 4.2-litre V8 with four valves per cylinder. From late 1999, Audi increased this to five valves per cylinder with power increased to {{convert|265|kW|hp|0}} and {{convert|430|Nm|lbft|0}}. From launch in 1996, European-market models came standard with a six-speed manual transmission. A sports-recalibrated version of the [[ZF 5HP24 transmission|ZF ''5HP24'']] five-speed [[tiptronic]] automatic, featuring \"Dynamic Shift Programme\" (DSP) was released a year later and was the only transmission available in most other markets.\n\nA retuned, {{convert|20|mm|in|1|adj=on}} lowered sports suspension included a 30 percent stiffer spring rate and 40 percent more compression damping in the [[shock absorber]]s. Speed-sensitive \"[[servotronic]]\" power assisted steering was also standard.\n\nThe brakes featured [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] 5.3 [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), with [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] (EBD), and worked radially ventilated front [[disc brake|discs]]. From 2002, an upgraded Bosch 5.7 [[electronic stability control|electronic stability programme]] became standard fitment.\n\n=== Engines ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Engine\n!rowspan=2|Power Torque at rpm\n!rowspan=2|0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h<br><small>(0\u201362&nbsp;mph)</small>\n!rowspan=2|Top speed\n|-\n!Displacement\n!Year\n!Type\n|-\n|2.8 (2771&nbsp;cc) || 1994\u20132002 || [[V6 engine|V6]] || {{convert|174|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}};

The model was longer than the previous generation, with room for four or five large adult occupants in the cabin, depending on rear seat configuration. The D3 development program began in 1996, with the design process commencing in Ingolstadt in 1997. The whole Audi design studio based in Ingolstadt first contributed sketch proposals, from which numerous different themes emerged. Six of them were developed into full size clay models and worked up in a traditional manner adjacent to full size tape drawings. At least three one quarter scale models were produced to explore other design variations.\n\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 225\n| image1 = 2004 Audi A8 (4E) 4.2 quattro sedan (2015-07-14) 02.jpg | caption1= Pre-facelift Audi A8 4.2 quattro\n| image2 = Audi A8 L D3 II.Facelift 20090720 front.JPG\n| image3 = Audi A8 L D3 II.Facelift 20090720 rear.JPG | caption3 = Facelift Audi A8 L 3.0 TDI\n}}\n\nThe six full size exterior clay models were reduced to two in late 1998 and these continued to be refined in parallel for a year.

This lengthy development time was in part due to the body being made from aluminium, a material less able to take the small radii of sharp feature lines such as those on the (steel bodied) A4 (B6) designed in 1998.\n\nIn parallel to the exterior design development the interior design was progressed with a total of four full size models produced and the production car's horizontally themed instrument panel design dominant from early on, with Norbert Schneider, Mark Bergold and Enzo Rothfuss the main contributing designers.\n\nGrouping major controls nearer the driver for a more driver focused identity whilst creating a more airy and spacious feel were early priorities for the interior design team was headed by Jurgen Albamonte. This was in part facilitated by the [[Multi Media Interface]] (MMI) designed by Jurgen Schr\u00f6der, that pioneered on the D3 A8 after the [[Audi Avantissimo]] concept car preview, and also by class leading colour and trim from Barbara Kr\u00f6meke and Melinda Jenkins.\n\nUnder the supervision of Dany Garand, during the first half of 2000 exterior and interior clay models were digitized and developed using digital design tools in a supporting, not leading, capacity. The D3 final production design was later frozen in the summer of 2000 for an August 2002 start of production.<ref name=\"cdn\"/>\n\nThe A8 was previewed at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#2001|2001 Frankfurt Motor Show]] by the [[Audi Avantissimo]] concept car. This concept introduced much of the technology later available on the series production A8 D3, including: [[Multi Media Interface]], 6-speed automatic transmission with shift paddles, V8 [[biturbo]] engine (RS6), [[self-levelling suspension|self-levelling]] [[adaptive air suspension]] with [[continuously controlled damping]], [[electric park brake]], [[bi-xenon headlight]]s with static [[Adaptive Front Lighting System (AFS)]] curve headlights, dashboard, driver identification systems with [[fingerprint scanner]].\n\nAs with the previous version, two body variants of the second generation A8 are offered, the A8 (standard, or short wheelbase), and the long-[[wheelbase]] (LWB) A8 L. The A8 L adds {{convert|120|mm|abbr=in}} to the rear legroom and {{convert|11|mm|2|abbr=on}} to the overall height of the car.\n\nFor quattro all wheel drive models, a [[ZF 6HP26 transmission|ZF ''6HP26-A61'']] (lower torque capacity 6HP19 version for 6 cylinder models) six-speed [[tiptronic]] automatic transmission with \"Dynamic Shift Programme\" (DSP) and \"sport\" mode, with optional steering wheel mounted paddle-shifters, is the only transmission offering. Output is transmitted via Audi's [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] generation IV all-wheel drive system using the [[Torsen]] T-1 centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] with a default 50:50 torque split front/rear. If the road conditions change, the purely mechanical Torsen differential responds without any delay; it can divert up to 70 percent of power to the front or rear axles.\n\n=== Innovations ===\n* World premiere of [[Multi Media Interface]] (MMI) in-car [[user interface]] (similar to BMW [[iDrive]])\n* [[Multiplexing|Multiplexed]] high speed [[MOST Bus]] [[optical fiber]] data networks (interconnecting tens of [[microprocessor]]s on common [[bus (computing)|databusses]]), integrated with MMI\n* First Audi with [[Bi-Xenon]] [[HID headlamp]]s for both low and high beam\n* World premiere of static [[Adaptive Front Lighting System (AFS)]] curve headlights (from [[Hella (company)|Hella]])<ref>[http://www.kfztech.de/kfztechnik/elo/licht/Lichttechnik_modern.htm Moderne Lichttechnik] - Kurvenlicht - statisch und dynamisch (AFS)</ref>\n* First Audi with 4-wheel [[adaptive suspension|Adaptive]] [[air suspension|Air Suspension]] and [[Continuous Damping Control]] (CDC)-(Skyhook suspension).\n* First Audi GPS [[automotive navigation system|navigation system]] with [[DVD]] maps\n* First Audi with six-speed automatic transmission (Tiptronic)\n* First Audi featuring [[fingerprint recognition|driver identification system]]\n\nIn 2005, new internal combustion engines became available. For European and Asian market customers, the entry-level 3.0-litre [[V6 engine]] was replaced with a new 3.2-litre unit featuring [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), which it shared with the [[Audi A4#B7|Audi B7 A4]] and [[Audi A6#C6|Audi C6 A6]]. The top-of-the-line W12 version debuted that year. The advantage of the [[W12 engine]] layout is its compact packaging, allowing Audi to build a 12-cylinder sedan with all-wheel drive, whereas a conventional V12 could only have a rear-wheel drive configuration as it would have no space in the engine bay for a differential and other components required to power the front wheels. In fact, Audi's 6.0-litre W12 is actually slightly smaller by overall dimensions than the 4.2-litre V8.<ref name=\"newcartestdrive1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.newcartestdrive.com/review-intro.cfm?Vehicle=2005_Audi_A8&ReviewID=2934 |title= 2005 Audi A8 Review, Prices, Photos |work= New Car Test Drive |date= |accessdate= 2010-10-03 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the added power trains, Audi restyled the D3 platform A8 range slightly in 2005, giving all variants a taller, wider [[trapezoid]]al ''single-frame'' grille.

The full version of the system (Pre Sense Plus) works in four phases. In the first phase, the system provides warning of an impending accident, while the hazard warning lights are activated, the side windows and sunroof are closed and the front seat belts are tensioned. In the second phase, the warning is followed by light braking, strong enough to win the driver's attention. The third phase initiates autonomous partial braking at a rate of 3&nbsp;m/s\u00b2 (9.8&nbsp;ft/s\u00b2). The fourth phase decelerates the car at 5&nbsp;m/s\u00b2 (16.4&nbsp;ft/s\u00b2) followed by automatic deceleration at full braking power, roughly half a second before projected impact. A second system, called (Pre Sense Rear), is designed to reduce the consequences of [[rear-end collision]]s. The sunroof and windows are closed and seat belts are prepared for impact. The optional memory seats are moved forward to protect the car's occupants. The system uses [[sensor fusion]] with twin [[radar]] and a mono camera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bosch-presse.de/TBWebDB/en-US/PressText.cfm?id=4570 |title=Extensive safety in the new Audi A8.

The S8 Plus was dialed up to {{Convert|605|hp|kW|abbr=on}} out of the same powerplant as the previous S8, by remapping the turbo boost and fuel delivery of the engine. Additionally, the Carbon Ceramic braking system is standard on the S8 Plus.

It began in 1979 with ''[[Mad Max]]'', and was followed by three films: ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' (1981, released in the United States as ''The Road Warrior''), ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'' (2015). [[Mel Gibson]] starred in the first three films and [[Tom Hardy]] took over as Max in the fourth film.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of [[Max Rockatansky]], a police officer in a future Australia which is experiencing [[societal collapse]] due to war and critical resource shortages. When his wife and child are murdered by a vicious biker gang, Max kills them in revenge and becomes a drifting loner in [[outback|the Wasteland]]. As Australia devolves further into barbarity, this skilled warrior of the road finds himself helping pockets of civilisation, initially for his own self-interest, but his motives always drift into more idealistic ones.\n\nThe series has been well-received by critics, with each film marked \"Certified Fresh\" on the film review aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes]]; ''Mad Max 2'' and ''Fury Road'' in particular have been ranked among the [[List of films considered the best#Action|best action films ever made]]. Furthermore, the series has also had a [[Mad Max series legacy and influence in popular culture|significant influence]] on popular culture, most notably [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction]], and encompasses works in additional media, including video games and comic books. In 2016, ''Fury Road'' became the first film of the ''Mad Max'' franchise to receive [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] recognition, including being nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Miller, and winning six of its ten nominations.\n\n==Films==\n===''Mad Max'' (1979)===\n{{Main|Mad Max}}\n\n''Mad Max'' is a 1979 Australian dystopian action film directed by [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]].

Beginning in May 2015, [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] published one issue per month, ending in August. A single-volume collection of all of the issues was published on 26 August. Reception of the series has been mixed; some consider it unnecessary and poorly executed, and many harshly criticised the issue centred on [[Imperator Furiosa]]. However, the issue focused on Nux and Immortan Joe and the two issues focused on Max Rockatansky were received more positively.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mad Max series legacy and influence in popular culture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Mad Max}}\n\n[[Category:Mad Max| ]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros.

It began in 1979 with ''[[Mad Max]]'', and was followed by three films: ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' (1981, released in the United States as ''The Road Warrior''), ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'' (2015). [[Mel Gibson]] starred in the first three films and [[Tom Hardy]] took over as Max in the fourth film.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of [[Max Rockatansky]], a police officer in a future Australia which is experiencing [[societal collapse]] due to war and critical resource shortages. When his wife and child are murdered by a vicious biker gang, Max kills them in revenge and becomes a drifting loner in [[outback|the Wasteland]]. As Australia devolves further into barbarity, this skilled warrior of the road finds himself helping pockets of civilisation, initially for his own self-interest, but his motives always drift into more idealistic ones.\n\nThe series has been well-received by critics, with each film marked \"Certified Fresh\" on the film review aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes]]; ''Mad Max 2'' and ''Fury Road'' in particular have been ranked among the [[List of films considered the best#Action|best action films ever made]]. Furthermore, the series has also had a [[Mad Max series legacy and influence in popular culture|significant influence]] on popular culture, most notably [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction]], and encompasses works in additional media, including video games and comic books. In 2016, ''Fury Road'' became the first film of the ''Mad Max'' franchise to receive [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] recognition, including being nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Miller, and winning six of its ten nominations.\n\n==Films==\n===''Mad Max'' (1979)===\n{{Main|Mad Max}}\n\n''Mad Max'' is a 1979 Australian dystopian action film directed by [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]].

Later, in June 2013, it was revealed at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] that developer [[Avalanche Studios]] would be developing [[Mad Max (2015 video game)|a video game]] based on the setting of ''Mad Max''. The game was released in September 2015 for [[Linux]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox One]], with the titular character being voiced by Bren Foster.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldfarb|first1=Andrew|title=E3 2013: Mad Max Announced for PlayStation 4|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/11/e3-2013-mad-max-announced-for-playstation-4|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=8 April 2015|date=10 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Comic book series===\n{{Main|Mad Max: Fury Road (comic book)}}\n''Mad Max: Fury Road'' is a [[Limited series (comics)|limited]] comic book series created by George Miller, [[Nico Lathouris]], and Mark Sexton. Serving as a prequel to the 2015 film of the same name, the series focuses on several of the film's characters. It consists of four issues. Beginning in May 2015, [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] published one issue per month, ending in August. A single-volume collection of all of the issues was published on 26 August. Reception of the series has been mixed; some consider it unnecessary and poorly executed, and many harshly criticised the issue centred on [[Imperator Furiosa]].

He was a talented and gifted child, graduating from a music school in three years, while most of his peers did in seven. In addition, Valery graduated from his high school with a gold medal, and at the same, while also attending an art school, he participated in numerous poetry competitions, often winning them. After school, he entered a medical university, with the aim of becoming a neurosurgeon. During his studies, Skoptsov was engaged in amateur performances, was a secretary for the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] and an excellent student. On the other hand, his stepbrother, Sergei Turaev, was the exact opposite: he did not want to study or work, often stole and drank too much. At one point, the two brothers ransacked a neighboring cottage, for which they were reprimanded, but weren't hindered at all by this. Soon after, they stole a car, and were rearrested. Skoptsov took the blame, and after a mental examination by the [[Serbsky Center|Serbsky Institute]], he was declared insane, with a diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]]. He soon left the medical university, as it was forbidden for somebody to study as a doctor if they were schizophrenic, and so, he enrolled into a cultural enlightenment school. After graduating ahead of schedule and with honors, he entered into the [[Saint-Petersburg State University of Culture and Arts|Leningrad Institute of Culture]]. Among his classmates were [[Valery Leontiev]], [[T\u00f5nis M\u00e4gi]] and a number of other future pop stars.<ref name=\"\u043a\u0440\"/>\n\nSoon, Skoptsov became interested in spiritual chants. To practice them, however, he required textbooks, which were [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|banned under Soviet law]]. He stole some from the library's closed fund, only choosing the most valuable: the altar gospel and a number of books on hymns, ancient Russian paintings and icons. For this, he was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. Skoptsov became heavily sought after in the criminal world, due to his impressive [[printmaking]] skills - the making of seals and stamps, and, by extension, falsification of documents. He began dabbling with this even while incarcerated, but to no avail. After working hard as a printmaker, he peaked in quality: the documents created by him were visually impossible to distinguish from real ones.\n\nSoon after their release, the two brothers went to work in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]], where they made fences for village cemeteries. On the night of February 24, 1989, in the town of [[Obol (town)|Obol]], [[Vitebsk Region]], Skoptsov and Turaev broke into the state farm cash desk: they cracked open the safe with the help of a [[thermal lance]], in which they found 168 [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] and 32 kopecks. Grabbing a typewriter, as well as stamps from the [[DOSAAF]] and the Society for the Protection of Antiquities, they fled. Sergei was arrested and testified; Valery disappeared from the view of law enforcement agencies for the next 7 years.\n\nSkoptsov left for [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], where he acquired a passport from a tramp and, placing his photograph on the passport, he was now known as \"Yevgeny Borisovich Spiridonov\". Subsequently, he changed his last, first and middle names, wives and residence permits a total of 13 more times. In Leningrad, Skoptsov graduated from the Beekeping Institute, while still maintaining part-time jobs as a graphic designer and printmaker. In October 1990, he carjacked a car from a garage cooperative in [[Veliky Novgorod]] and, after changing the license plates and forging the documents, sold it. He repeated this \"operation\" on multiple other occasions. His places of residence, along with the areas he committed crimes, constantly changed, moving mainly between the Northwestern and Central parts of Russia. Namely, he had stayed in St. Petersburg and Veliky Novgorod, as well as the [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]], [[Tula Oblast|Tula]], [[Kaluga Oblast|Kaluga]], [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk]], [[Oryol Oblast|Oryol]] and [[Smolensk Oblast|Smolensk]] oblasts.\n\nAt the end of 1993, Skoptsov was driving a stolen car through the Smolensk Oblast, when he was stopped by [[General Administration for Traffic Safety|traffic police]]. He offered them a bribe, and he was not arrested for hijacking: he handed the officers expensive products that were in the car, as well as the car itself. By the time the authorities discovered a warehouse worth of fake documents and a unique musical instrument/firearm hybrid made from an ordinary [[squeezebox]], Valery was very far ahead of them. His fascinating creation was later put on display at the Museum of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nThe severity of Skoptsov's crimes gradually began to escalate. In February 1995, he raped an 11-year-old girl in the village of Zhuchki, in Smolensk Oblast, who barely escaped with her life. After that, Valery moved to the Oryol Oblast, and at the Lesnaya Polyana recreation center, he got himself acquainted with Mikhail Karpukhin, an alcoholic watchman who also had a part-time job as an entertainer. Skoptsov then bought a house, which was next door to the headquarters of the [[Uritsky District]] police.\n\nOn the night of August 3, 1995, Skoptsov and Karpukhin committed a double murder along the 24th kilometer of the [[Oryol]]-[[Bryansk]] highway, taking with them a VAZ-2105 Zhigula and dumping the corpses in a nearby pond afterwards. Using his forgery skills, Valery later sold the car in Tula Oblast. Karpukhin, taking advantage of his position as an official, kept his partner-in-crime in the know about the police investigation. According to Skoptsov, \"the local police chiefs were steaming in the bathhouse, getting drunk and talking about who's what\".<ref name=\"\u043a\u0440\"/>\n\nIn the summer of 1995, Skoptsov acquired the \"Bright Life\" plot, near the lake of the \"Zvezda\" horticultural partnership. There, he also set up his car, which functioned as his workshop: in it, he had many machines, pesticides, artisanal devices for making seals, and much more.<ref name=\"\u043a\u0440\"/> Soon, Skoptsov made friends with a group of scammers led by Vladimir \"San Sanych\" Manuilov, who constantly was in need of fake documents. However, after some time, he stopped paying Valery, and the latter stopped making fake documents in response. Then Manuilov and his assistant Pogasyan, nicknamed \"Ara\", beat up Skoptsov, breaking his arm in the process, before tying him to a wheelchair and dousing him with gasoline. At the last moment, they provided some first aid to Valery, telling him that he would now work free of charge, and that his trailer would be converted into a warehouse.<ref name=\"\u043a\u0440\"/>\n\nWanting to exact revenge, Skoptsov lured Manuilov, Pogasyan and their associate Irina Streltsova into the trailer, where he shot them all with a converted [[sawed-off shotgun]], which fired live [[flare gun]] ammunition, before he set off to Bryansk, where he believed that Manuilov's wife had a significant amount in dollars. On June 20, 1996, after having a bottle of vodka with Svetlana Manuilova and her friend, Lyudmila Sinichenko, he killed both, but found no money. After this, Skoptsov began feeling very ill, barely reaching the swamps on the outskirts of Bryansk before losing consciousness: likely a result from poor quality vodka. There, he was discovered by Sergei Sharipov and his friend, who were long-time drug addicts. With Sharipov's help, Valery returned to the Manuilov residence, where he first burned the bodies before burying them. As an act of gratitude, he gave Sergei a gold ring and watch, lifted off Streltsova's corpse. Subsequently, the duo committed another double murder, reminiscent of the one done with Karpukhin, one of the victims being a police officer. Sharipov was soon after detained in Bryansk and implicated his companion; however, he knew him under the name of \"Vitaly Pilipenko\". Despite this, while browsing through the files of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|MOI]], Skoptsov was recognized by the officers via a snapshot, as a wanted criminal who has been on the run for 7 years.\n\nMeanwhile, Skoptsov now lived in the village of [[Zalegoshch]], with a forged passport under the name of \"Oleg Porfiriyev\", a forged teaching diploma and [[employment record book]]. He got a job as a singing and drawing teacher at a local school, gaining high authority among staff and students alike. Soon, however, some of his students saw his mugshot on television with the captio \"Attention, wanted!\". They reported this news to their teacher, but this time, he didn't run away. He was soon arrested by the police, while teaching one of his classes.\n\n== Investigation, trial and death ==\nSkoptsov willingly confessed to the investigators, providing a full testimony with colorful illustrations, including the 9 murders. On July 9, 1998, the Oryal Oblast Court [[Capital punishment|sentenced him to death]], but it was later commuted to [[life imprisonment]]. Mikhail Karpukhin got 8 years at a [[corrective labor colony]], while Sergei Sharipov died of [[tuberculosis]] at the Oryol detention center.\n\nHe was sent to serve his sentence at the [[Black Dolphin Prison]], where his main occupation was poetry:<ref name=\"\u043a\u0440\"/>\n{| style=\"width:400px\"\n|\"I now have no fate,\n\nThere is even no earth, no sky,\n\nLike God's free slaves,\n\nWe get here a ration of bread\".</blockquote></blockquote>\n|}\nAccording to investigators, Skoptsov did not regret his actions. During one of the interrogations, he was quoted as saying: \"It was necessary to clean up after my brother and Sharipov, too. My brother broke my fate\".<ref name=\"\u043a\u0440\">Criminal Russia.

As an act of gratitude, he gave Sergei a gold ring and watch, lifted off Streltsova's corpse. Subsequently, the duo committed another double murder, reminiscent of the one done with Karpukhin, one of the victims being a police officer. Sharipov was soon after detained in Bryansk and implicated his companion; however, he knew him under the name of \"Vitaly Pilipenko\". Despite this, while browsing through the files of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|MOI]], Skoptsov was recognized by the officers via a snapshot, as a wanted criminal who has been on the run for 7 years.\n\nMeanwhile, Skoptsov now lived in the village of [[Zalegoshch]], with a forged passport under the name of \"Oleg Porfiriyev\", a forged teaching diploma and [[employment record book]]. He got a job as a singing and drawing teacher at a local school, gaining high authority among staff and students alike. Soon, however, some of his students saw his mugshot on television with the captio \"Attention, wanted!\". They reported this news to their teacher, but this time, he didn't run away. He was soon arrested by the police, while teaching one of his classes.\n\n== Investigation, trial and death ==\nSkoptsov willingly confessed to the investigators, providing a full testimony with colorful illustrations, including the 9 murders. On July 9, 1998, the Oryal Oblast Court [[Capital punishment|sentenced him to death]], but it was later commuted to [[life imprisonment]]. Mikhail Karpukhin got 8 years at a [[corrective labor colony]], while Sergei Sharipov died of [[tuberculosis]] at the Oryol detention center.\n\nHe was sent to serve his sentence at the [[Black Dolphin Prison]], where his main occupation was poetry:<ref name=\"\u043a\u0440\"/>\n{| style=\"width:400px\"\n|\"I now have no fate,\n\nThere is even no earth, no sky,\n\nLike God's free slaves,\n\nWe get here a ration of bread\".</blockquote></blockquote>\n|}\nAccording to investigators, Skoptsov did not regret his actions. During one of the interrogations, he was quoted as saying: \"It was necessary to clean up after my brother and Sharipov, too. My brother broke my fate\".<ref name=\"\u043a\u0440\">Criminal Russia.
