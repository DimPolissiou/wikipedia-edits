California Medical Association''''', {{law report|224|Cal. App. 2d|378}} (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1964) was a [[legal case]] between two medical associations in the state of [[California]].  The case was under review in California state courts from 1962-1964.  After numerous appeals, the [[California Supreme Court]] ruling found the [[California Medical Association#Merger with the California Osteopathic Association|California Medical Association's]] refusal to grant [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physicians]] [[Medical_license#United_States|licensure to practice medicine]] in the state of California to be [[unconstitutional]].\n\n==Background==\nBy the 1950s, [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopathic physicians]] (D.O.) were numerous in California compared to their [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) counterparts, since the medical school at [[University of California, Irvine]] was an osteopathic medical school. Nevertheless, osteopathic physicians began to feel victimized by the national image of osteopathic medicine, particularly from those MDs who viewed colleges of osteopathic medicine as teaching \"cultist healing.\"<ref name=\"Gevitz, Norman 2004\">Gevitz, Norman (2004). ''The DOs: Osteopathic Medicine in America''. The [[Johns Hopkins University]] Press. {{ISBN|978-0801878343}}.</ref>\n\nLeaders of the California Medical Association (CMA) and the California Osteopathic Association (COA) met secretly behind closed doors in the late 1950s to discuss a potential merger between the two medical groups. By May 1961, a contract between CMA and COA was ready to be voted on by their respective House of Delegates. As part of the merger, which was approved in 1962, all graduates from the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons (COP&S) as well as DOs who held a valid license in the state would be awarded a Doctor of Medicine degree. Further, those DOs who accepted the MD degree could no longer identify themselves as osteopathic physicians.<ref name=\"Gevitz, Norman 2004\"/>\n\nAs part of the merger agreement, COP&S was renamed as the California College of Medicine and accredited as a MD degree granting institution. Additionally, an initiative, proposition 22, was placed on the state ballot during the November 1962 elections that would limit the osteopathic state licensing board from administering new licensing. It could still renew licenses of DOs until the number of practicing DOs diminished to less than 40, at which time it would be dissolved and the remaining DOs transferred to the jurisdiction of the state medical licensing board.<ref name=\"Gevitz, Norman 2004\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the California College of Medicine was adopted by the University of California Regents in 1964 and placed on their Irvine campus in 1968. Ex-DO faculty that received the MD degree in 1962 taught alongside congenital MD faculty for several decades henceforth. In 2007 the college's name was again changed to the University of California Irvine, School of Medicine.\n\nThe California Medical Association (CMA) issued [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degrees to all [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]]s in the state of California for a nominal fee. \"By attending a short seminar and paying $65, a doctor of osteopathy (now Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) (DO) could obtain an MD degree; 86 percent of the DOs in the state (out of a total of about 2000) chose to do so.\"<ref name = \"Paradox\">{{cite journal | author = Howell J.

California Medical Association''''', {{law report|224|Cal. App. 2d|378}} (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1964) was a [[legal case]] between two medical associations in the state of [[California]].  The case was under review in California state courts from 1962-1964.  After numerous appeals, the [[California Supreme Court]] ruling found the [[California Medical Association#Merger with the California Osteopathic Association|California Medical Association's]] refusal to grant [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physicians]] [[Medical_license#United_States|licensure to practice medicine]] in the state of California to be [[unconstitutional]].\n\n==Background==\nBy the 1950s, [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopathic physicians]] (D.O.) were numerous in California compared to their [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) counterparts, since the medical school at [[University of California, Irvine]] was an osteopathic medical school. Nevertheless, osteopathic physicians began to feel victimized by the national image of osteopathic medicine, particularly from those MDs who viewed colleges of osteopathic medicine as teaching \"cultist healing.\"<ref name=\"Gevitz, Norman 2004\">Gevitz, Norman (2004). ''The DOs: Osteopathic Medicine in America''. The [[Johns Hopkins University]] Press. {{ISBN|978-0801878343}}.</ref>\n\nLeaders of the California Medical Association (CMA) and the California Osteopathic Association (COA) met secretly behind closed doors in the late 1950s to discuss a potential merger between the two medical groups. By May 1961, a contract between CMA and COA was ready to be voted on by their respective House of Delegates. As part of the merger, which was approved in 1962, all graduates from the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons (COP&S) as well as DOs who held a valid license in the state would be awarded a Doctor of Medicine degree. Further, those DOs who accepted the MD degree could no longer identify themselves as osteopathic physicians.<ref name=\"Gevitz, Norman 2004\"/>\n\nAs part of the merger agreement, COP&S was renamed as the California College of Medicine and accredited as a MD degree granting institution. Additionally, an initiative, proposition 22, was placed on the state ballot during the November 1962 elections that would limit the osteopathic state licensing board from administering new licensing. It could still renew licenses of DOs until the number of practicing DOs diminished to less than 40, at which time it would be dissolved and the remaining DOs transferred to the jurisdiction of the state medical licensing board.<ref name=\"Gevitz, Norman 2004\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the California College of Medicine was adopted by the University of California Regents in 1964 and placed on their Irvine campus in 1968. Ex-DO faculty that received the MD degree in 1962 taught alongside congenital MD faculty for several decades henceforth. In 2007 the college's name was again changed to the University of California Irvine, School of Medicine.\n\nThe California Medical Association (CMA) issued [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degrees to all [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]]s in the state of California for a nominal fee. \"By attending a short seminar and paying $65, a doctor of osteopathy (now Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) (DO) could obtain an MD degree; 86 percent of the DOs in the state (out of a total of about 2000) chose to do so.\"<ref name = \"Paradox\">Howell, J.

There is zero empirical scientific evidence supporting the law of attraction, and it is widely considered a pseudoscience. \n\nAdvocates generally combine [[cognitive reframing]] techniques with affirmations and [[creative visualization]] to replace limiting or self-destructive (\"negative\") thoughts with more empowered, adaptive (\"positive\") thoughts. A key component of the philosophy is the idea that in order to effectively change one's negative thinking patterns, one must also \"feel\" (through [[creative visualization]]) that the desired changes have already occurred.

The belief was that for students to succeed academically (and largely, in life), they must develop a positive sense of their own self-worth. The rationale behind this theory comes from the perspective that people who are successful are also generally positive when discussing their success (e.g., motivational speakers), therefore one\u2019s success must be related to how they view themselves. Thus, the American education system received a complete reconstruction to ensure students felt valued in their academic efforts. Grading curves were implemented so that fewer students were held back, honour rolls were removed to prevent lower-achieving individuals from feeling disappointed in themselves, and teachers could no longer grade assignments using red ink as this was viewed as \u201cstigmatizing\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Skeptic |date=2009|volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=30-38 |title=Positively misguided: The myths and mistakes of the positive thinking movement|last1=Salerno |first1=S }}</ref>. Students were no longer held to the same standard of achievement. It was later realized that this system was ultimately unsuccessful in promoting success; lower-achieving students who were advanced further into higher-level grades were unable, or unwilling to, garner an understanding of the curriculum. Thus, in spite of having grandiose self-value, student academic achievement was unable to match it.

There is zero empirical scientific evidence supporting the law of attraction, and it is widely considered a pseudoscience. \n\nAdvocates generally combine [[cognitive reframing]] techniques with affirmations and [[creative visualization]] to replace limiting or self-destructive (\"negative\") thoughts with more empowered, adaptive (\"positive\") thoughts. A key component of the philosophy is the idea that in order to effectively change one's negative thinking patterns, one must also \"feel\" (through [[creative visualization]]) that the desired changes have already occurred. This combination of positive thought and positive emotion is believed to allow one to attract positive experiences and opportunities by achieving resonance with the proposed energetic law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/what-is-the-law-of-attraction/|title=What Is The Law Of Attraction|last1=Hurst|first1=Katherine|date=|website=The Law Of Attraction|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe Law of Attraction has no scientific basis<ref name=\"Scientific American\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Shermer | first = Michael\n  | authorlink = Michael Shermer\n  | title = The (Other) Secret\n  | journal = [[Scientific American]]\n  | volume = 296\n  | issue = 6\n  | pages = 39\n  | date = 1 June 2007\n  | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0607-39\n  | pmid = 17663221\n }}</ref> and has been dubbed a [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=\"Live Science\">{{cite web\n  | last = Radford | first = Benjamin\n  | authorlink = Benjamin Radford\n  | title = The Pseudoscience of 'The Secret'\n  | work = [[Live Science]]\n  | date = 3 February 2009\n  | url = http://www.livescience.com/5303-pseudoscience-secret.html\n  | accessdate = 31 March 2017\n}}</ref> A number of researchers have criticized the misuse of scientific concepts by its proponents.<ref name=\"Scientific American\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=Cosmic Mind |url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |publisher=University of Colorado |authorlink=Victor_Stenger |pages=8\u201319 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924013317/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"Leon Lederman 1993 189\u2013198\">{{cite book |title=The God Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question |pages=189\u2013198 |author=Leon Lederman |author2=Dick Teresi |date=1993 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}</ref><ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci Non-science posing as science; Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[New Thought]] movement grew out of the teachings of [[Phineas Quimby]] in the early 19th century. Early in his life, Quimby was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. Early 19th century medicine had no reliable cure for tuberculosis. Quimby took to horse riding and noted that intense excitement temporarily relieved him from his affliction. This method for relieving his pain and seemingly subsequent recovery prompted Phineas to pursue a study of \"Mind over Body\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=n|title=Phineas Parkhurst Quimby|url=http://phineasquimby.wwwhubs.com/|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>  Although he never used the words \"Law of Attraction\", he explained this in a statement that captured the concept in the field of health: {{quote|the trouble is in the mind, for the body is only the house for the mind to dwell in, and we put a value on it according to its worth. Therefore if your mind has been deceived by some invisible enemy into a belief, you have put it into the form of a disease, with or without your knowledge. By my theory or truth, I come in contact with your enemy and restore you to your health and happiness.

In this, Mulford was followed by other New Thought authors, such as Henry Wood (starting with his ''God\u2019s Image in Man'',<ref>{{cite book|title=God's Image in Man, Ch. 6, \"The Universality of Law\"|url=https://archive.org/stream/godsimageinmans01woodgoog#page/n134/mode/2up|publisher=Lee and Shepard Publishers, 1892}}</ref> 1892), and [[Ralph Waldo Trine]] (starting with his first book, ''What All the World's A-Seeking'',<ref>{{cite book|title=What All the World's A-Seeking|url=https://archive.org/details/whatallworldsas00tringoog|publisher=New Canaan, Conn., Keats Pub|year=1973}}</ref> 1896).

While positivity can improve one\u2019s quality of life and resilience through hardship <ref>{{cite journal |journal=International Journal of Medicine |date=2015|volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=24-28 |title=The effect of positive thinking on quality of life and resiliency of cancer patients |doi=10.17795/rijm27122|last1=Mousavi |first1=E|last2=Esmaeili|first2=A|last3=Saless |first3=S |doi-access=free }}</ref>, it can also be misguiding. Holding the belief that positive thinking will manifest positivity in one\u2019s life diminishes the value of hard work and perseverance, such as in the 1970s pursual of \u201cself-esteem-based education\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Skeptic |date=2009|volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=30-38 |title=Positively misguided: The myths and mistakes of the positive thinking movement|last1=Salerno |first1=S }}</ref>. The belief was that for students to succeed academically (and largely, in life), they must develop a positive sense of their own self-worth. The rationale behind this theory comes from the perspective that people who are successful are also generally positive when discussing their success (e.g., motivational speakers), therefore one\u2019s success must be related to how they view themselves. Thus, the American education system received a complete reconstruction to ensure students felt valued in their academic efforts. Grading curves were implemented so that fewer students were held back, honour rolls were removed to prevent lower-achieving individuals from feeling disappointed in themselves, and teachers could no longer grade assignments using red ink as this was viewed as \u201cstigmatizing\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Skeptic |date=2009|volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=30-38 |title=Positively misguided: The myths and mistakes of the positive thinking movement|last1=Salerno |first1=S }}</ref>. Students were no longer held to the same standard of achievement. It was later realized that this system was ultimately unsuccessful in promoting success; lower-achieving students who were advanced further into higher-level grades were unable, or unwilling to, garner an understanding of the curriculum. Thus, in spite of having grandiose self-value, student academic achievement was unable to match it. While empirical research has shown that there is an existing relationship between student self-worth and school achievement <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=2008|volume=45|pages=559-564 |title=Relations of academic and general self-esteem to school achievement|last1=Pullmann |first1=H |last2=Allik|first2=J }}</ref>, the motivation of students to work hard and achieve based on their own academic merit cannot be discounted.\n\n==Prominent supporters==\n\n* In 1891 Californian author and humorist [[Prentice Mulford]] used the term Law of Attraction in his essays ''Some Laws of Health and Beauty'' and ''Good And Ill Effects of Thought''.\n* In 1897 [[Ralph Waldo Trine]] wrote ''In Tune with the Infinite''.

He cites Jesus Christ as being the greatest teacher of metaphysics who ever lived and explains that thoughts are our most important emanation, more important than what we say or what we do. In the books ''Power Through Constructive Thinking'' and ''Find and Use your Inner Power'' Fox speaks about \"building the mental equivalent of what you want and to expunge those that you don't\".\n* In his New Thought Movement book [[William Walker Atkinson]] used the phrase ''Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World'' (1906), stating that \"like attracts like\".<ref>[http://gitacademy.tripod.com/GodsInTraining/ThoughtVibration.htm William Walker Atkinson.

The first, ''[[The Law of Success|The Law of Success in 16 Lessons]]'' (1928), directly and repeatedly references the Law of Attraction and proposes that it operates by use of radio waves transmitted by the brain.

He mentions a \"secret\" to success and promises to indirectly describe it at least once in every chapter. It is never named and he says that discovering it on one's own is far more beneficial. Many people have argued over what it<ref>{{cite web|title=Why The Law of Attraction has been a Secret|url=http://www.law-of-attraction.com/131/law-of-attraction-has-been-a-secret/|publisher=Positive Inspiration|access-date=15 May 2016|date=2016-04-06}}</ref> actually is, some claim it's the Law of Attraction.

The publication featured, as well, contemporary theories and philosophies in the arts, general news articles, a select number of book reviews, commentaries, editorials and special issues.\n\nThe special issues were wide-ranging, reflecting the times and the interests of the editors and writers who were involved at a given time over the course of its existence.\n\nSpecial issues included: \u201cArt Against Apartheid.\u201d \u201cArt and Sports,\u201d \u201cAre There Too Many Artists?,\u201d \u201cTilted Arc by Richard Serra,\u201d \"Museums,\" and \u201cArtists Against US Intervention in Central America.\u201d\n\n''Art Workers News'' was also the publication of record for the [[CETA Artists Project (NYC Cultural Council Foundation 1978-80)|Comprehensive Employment Act (CETA) Artists Program]] in New York City and documented the work of artists in all media associated with the project.<ref>Judd Tully, a writer for the CETA Artists Project, has digitized some of his ''AWN'' articles (retrieved 1/30/18) <http://juddtully.net/publications/art-workers-news/></ref>\n\n''AWN/A&A'' produced 160 issues over eighteen years.

During the early 1980s, FCA changed the publication's name to ''Art&Artists'' and made it a bi-monthly.\n\nRather than reviewing shows, AWN/A&A focused on topics central to the lives of working artists in the 1970s and \u201980s, (and continuing today): artist housing, health hazards, business practices, health insurance, women\u2019s issues, issues affecting artists of color, law and the arts and censorship were impacting the daily life of artists.
