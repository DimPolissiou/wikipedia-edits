The World Bank defines its regions as East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Lastly, the World Bank distinguishes countries based on the operational policies of the World Bank. The three categories include International Development Association (IDA) countries, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) countries, and Blend countries.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Countries|Geography}}\n* [[City network]]\n* [[Constituent state]]\n* [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by continent]]\n* [[Lists of countries and territories]]\n* [[Micronation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--\n* Anderson, Benedict; 'Imagined Communities: Reflections On the origin and Spread of Nationalism'; London, Verso; 1991\n* Viotti, Paul R. and Kauppi, Mark V.; 'International Relations and World Politics \u2013 Security, Economy, Identity'; Second Edition; New Jersey, Prentice Hall; 2001\n-->\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15868439 Defining what makes a country] ''The Economist''\n\n==External links==\n{{sister project links|d=Property:P17}}\n* [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html The CIA World Factbook]\n* [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ Country Studies] from the [[United States Library of Congress]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090108200417/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/foreigngovt.htm Foreign Information by Country] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080625035909/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/foreignalpha.htm Country & Territory Guides] from GovPubs at UCB Libraries\n* [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/ United Nations statistics division]\n\n{{Lists of countries and territories by continent}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Countries| ]]\n[[Category:Human geography]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{short description|Region that is identified as a distinct entity in political geography}}\n[[File:Political Map of the World, June 2019.pdf|thumb|upright=2|2019 map showing countries with full recognition and some [[List of states with limited recognition|UN non-member states]]; some [[List of territorial disputes|disputed territories]] are not shown]]\n\nThe term '''country''' refers to a political state or nation or its territory.

For the 2020 fiscal year, the World Bank defines low-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $1,025 or less in 2018; lower middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $1,026 and $3,995; upper middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $3,996 and $12,375; high-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $12,376 or more.<ref>{{cite web |title=How does the World Bank classify countries? |url=https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/378834-how-does-the-world-bank-classify-countries |website=The World Bank |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIt also identifies regional trends. The World Bank defines its regions as East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Lastly, the World Bank distinguishes countries based on the operational policies of the World Bank. The three categories include International Development Association (IDA) countries, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) countries, and Blend countries.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Countries|Geography}}\n* [[City network]]\n* [[Constituent state]]\n* [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by continent]]\n* [[Lists of countries and territories]]\n* [[Micronation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--\n* Anderson, Benedict; 'Imagined Communities: Reflections On the origin and Spread of Nationalism'; London, Verso; 1991\n* Viotti, Paul R. and Kauppi, Mark V.; 'International Relations and World Politics \u2013 Security, Economy, Identity'; Second Edition; New Jersey, Prentice Hall; 2001\n-->\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15868439 Defining what makes a country] ''The Economist''\n\n==External links==\n{{sister project links|d=Property:P17}}\n* [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html The CIA World Factbook]\n* [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ Country Studies] from the [[United States Library of Congress]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090108200417/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/foreigngovt.htm Foreign Information by Country] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080625035909/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/foreignalpha.htm Country & Territory Guides] from GovPubs at UCB Libraries\n* [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/ United Nations statistics division]\n\n{{Lists of countries and territories by continent}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Countries| ]]\n[[Category:Human geography]]\n", "name_user": "Longdongwong", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSovereignty status", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"}

The film, directed by [[David S. Goyer]], was released in theaters on April 27, 2007, and on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on October 16, 2007. ''The Invisible'' is a [[remake]] of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] film ''[[Den osynlige]]'', which was based on the Swedish [[young adult fiction|YA]] novel ''The Invisible'' by [[Mats Wahl]]. It was filmed mostly in and around the city of [[Vancouver]], and was the last film distributed by [[Hollywood Pictures]] before the label was once again dissolved, this time permanently by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]].\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school senior Nick Powell plans to skip his graduation and fly to London for a writing program, despite the plan of his controlling mother, Diane.  His mother pressures him to succeed and is emotionally distant.\n\nNick's best friend, Pete Egan, confides in him that he is bullied by Annie Newton, a troubled teen. Nick attempts to step in on one such occasion, only for it to escalate into a physical confrontation. Annie's closest friends are violent thieves, and her boyfriend, Marcus, is on parole for similar violations.\n\nNick tells Pete about his plans to leave for London and they say goodbye. Annie decides to rob a jewelry store across the street from where Marcus is stealing a car. Marcus reprimands her, and tries to take the jewels for himself, but Annie keeps them and pushes him to try to stop her. Believing Annie is out of control, Marcus tips off the cops. Annie is arrested and assumes that Pete is responsible because he saw her load the merchandise into her locker.\n\nShe later attempts to beat a confession out of Pete. When Annie does not believe his innocence, Pete reluctantly gives up Nick's name, thinking that Nick is already on a plane to London. He is unaware that Nick gave his ticket to a girl at a party, having decided not to go. When Annie and her crew find Nick walking home from the party, they run him off the road and beat him mercilessly. When Annie believes she has killed Nick, they dump his body into a sewer.\n\nThe next morning Nick goes to school to find that no one can see or hear him.  He returns home to find his mother has filed a missing person's report, and the police are investigating his disappearance. After a while, Nick realizes that he is still alive, but unconscious. When Nick realizes that he is having an [[out-of-body experience]], he reaches out to Annie and Pete to save his life.\n\nDetective Larson seems close to putting together the whole truth, and implies that once he finds Annie he will be able to pin the robberies and murder on Marcus. Since Marcus is still on parole, Detective Larson tells him that even being associated with the murder could send him back to prison. Marcus decides to get involved and kidnaps Pete, forcing him to lead him to Nick's body so they can move it to another location. He conspires to kill Annie and arranges to meet with her. Annie calls Pete to the meeting place as well, who is under surveillance by the police. As Annie flees from both Marcus and the police, Nick yells at her and she hears him for the first time.\n\nAlthough the two cannot have a conversation, she hears some of his voice in her head and can sense his presence. Annie feels her actions weighing on her conscience and stops to visit Nick's room to get a sense of who he is. The two realize that they were similar and given different circumstances, the two could have been close. Diane catches Annie in his room, and she flees. She returns to the woods to find Nick's body, only to see that it has been moved. She confronts Pete and Marcus to learn the body's location. Marcus tells her, but shoots her in the stomach as she leaves. She shoots Marcus in return, and calls the police to tell them where to find Nick. Nick's body is found in a dam and is saved. After visiting him in the hospital, Annie dies from her wounds.\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Nick meets Annie's younger brother, Victor, flying his model plane at the park. They both commemorate Annie by writing her a message on top of the plane and flying it across the river bank.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Justin Chatwin]] as Nicholas \"Nick\" Powell \u2014 The protagonist, who wakes up to find that he is invisible, before discovering that he had been beaten to near death and is projecting himself from his missing body.

His work attracted the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]] to commission an in-depth evaluation into 155 medical schools in the US and Canada.<ref name=\"Bonner\">{{cite journal|last1=Bonner|first1=Thomas Neville|title=Searching for Abraham Flexner|journal=Academic Medicine|date=February 1998|volume=73|issue=2|pages=160\u2013166|doi=10.1097/00001888-199802000-00014|pmid=9484189}}</ref> It was his resultant self-titled ''[[Flexner Report]]'', published in 1910, that sparked the reform of [[medical education]] in the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"Brown\" /> Flexner was also a founder of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], which brought together some of the greatest minds in history to collaborate on intellectual discovery and research.<ref name=\"Bonner\" />\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nFlexner was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] on November 13, 1866. He was the sixth of nine children born to German Jewish immigrants, Ester and Moritz Flexner.<ref name=\"Autobiography\">''Abraham Flexner: An Autobiography'', New York: SImon and Schuster, 1960, pp. 2\u20134.</ref> He was the first in his family to complete high school and go on to college.<ref name=\"Bonner\" /> In 1886, at age 19, Flexner completed a Bachelor of Arts in [[classics]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he studied for only two years. In 1905, he pursued graduate studies in [[psychology]] at [[Harvard University]], and at the [[University of Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2003/ms003042.pdf |title=Abraham Flexner Papers \u2013 A Finding Aid to the Collection in the Library of Congress |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |page=4 |date=April 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}</ref> He did not, however, complete work on an advanced degree at either institution.\n\n===Personal life===\nFlexner had three brothers named Jacob, Bernard and Simon Flexner. He also had a sister named Rachel Flexner.<ref name=\"ias.edu\">{{cite web|title=Abraham Flexner|url=https://www.ias.edu/people/flexner |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study}}</ref>\n\nThe success of Abraham Flexner's experimental schooling allowed him to help finance [[Simon Flexner]]'s medical education at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]]. He proceeded to become a pathologist, bacteriologist and a medical researcher employed by the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]] from 1901 to 1935.<ref name=\"ias.edu\" />\n\n[[File:aflexner21.jpg|thumb|right|Flexner circa 1895]]\nFlexner also financed his sister's undergraduate studies at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. Jacob ran a drugstore and used the profits from selling the establishment to attend medical school. He then practiced as a physician in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. Bernard pursued a career in law and later practiced in both Chicago and New York.<ref name=\"ias.edu\" />\n\nIn 1896, Flexner married a former student of his school, [[Anne Crawford Flexner|Anne Laziere Crawford]]. She was a teacher who soon became a successful playwright and children's author. The success of her play ''Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch'' (based on the [[Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch|1901 novel]]) funded Flexner's studies at Harvard and his year abroad at European universities. The couple had two daughters Jean and Eleanor. Jean went on to become one of the original employees of the United States Division of Labor Standards. [[Eleanor Flexner]] became an independent scholar and pioneer of women's studies.<ref name=\"ias.edu\" />\n\nFlexner grew up in an [[Orthodox Jew]]ish family, however, early on he became a religious agnostic.<ref name=\"Bonner\" />\n\nIn addition to contributions by his brother Simon, their nephew, [[Louis B. Flexner|Louis Barkhouse Flexner]], was founding director of the Mahoney Institute of Neurological Sciences at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and a former editor of the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Death===\nFlexner died in [[Falls Church, Virginia]], in 1959 at 92 years of age. He was buried in [[Cave Hill Cemetery]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref name=\"ias.edu\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Experimental schooling===\nAfter graduating from Johns Hopkins University in two years with a degree in classics, Flexner returned to Louisville to teach classics at [[Louisville Male High School]]. Four years later, Flexner founded a private school in which he would test his growing ideas about education. Flexner opposed the standard model of education that focused on mental discipline and a rigid structure. Moreover, \"Mr. Flexner's School\" did not give out traditional grades, used no standard curriculum, refused to impose examinations on students, and kept no academic record of students. Instead, it promoted small learning groups, individual development, and a more hands-on approach to education. Graduates of his school were soon accepted at leading colleges, and his teaching style began to attract considerable attention.<ref name=\"Bonner\" />\n\n===''The American College''===\nIn 1908, Flexner published his first book, ''The American College''. Strongly critical of many aspects of American higher education, it denounced, in particular, the university lecture as a method of instruction. According to Flexner, lectures enabled colleges to \"handle cheaply by wholesale a large body of students that would be otherwise unmanageable and thus give the lecturer time for research.\" In addition, Flexner was concerned about the chaotic condition of the undergraduate curriculum and the influence of the research culture of the university. Neither contributed to the mission of the college to address the whole person. He feared that \"research had largely appropriated the resources of the college, substituting the methods and interest of highly specialized investigation for the larger objects of college teaching.\"<ref>Abraham Flexner, ''The American College'', New York: The Century Company, 1908, pp. 215\u2013216</ref>\n\nHis book attracted the attention of [[Henry Pritchett]], president of the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]], who was looking for someone to lead a series of studies of professional education. The book consistently cited Pritchett in discussions of views on educational reform, and the two soon arranged to meet through the then-president of [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Ira Remsen]]. Although Flexner had never set foot inside a medical school, he was Pritchett's first choice to lead a study of American medical education, and soon joined the research staff at the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] in 1908. Although not a physician himself, Flexner was selected by Pritchett for his writing ability and his disdain for traditional education.<ref name=\"Bonner\" />\n\n===''Flexner Report''===\n{{main|Flexner Report}}\nIn 1909, Flexner published the ''Bootie Report'', which examined the state of American medical education and led to far-reaching reform in the training of doctors. The ''Flexner Report'' led to the closure of most rural medical schools and all but two African-American medical colleges in the United States, given his adherence to [[germ theory]], in which he argued that if not properly trained and treated, African-Americans and the poor posed a health threat to middle/upper class European-Americans.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Beck AH |title=The Flexner Report and the standardization of American medical education|journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=291|pages=2139\u20132140|doi=10.1001/jama.291.17.2139 |year=2004 |pmid=15126445|issue=17}}</ref>  His position was:\n{{quote|The practice of the Negro doctor will be limited to his own race, which in its turn will be cared for better by good Negro physicians than by poor white ones.

Not only does the Negro himself suffer from hookworm and tuberculosis; he communicates them to his white neighbors, precisely as the ignorant and unfortunate white contaminates him. Self-protection not less than humanity offers weighty counsel in this matter; self-interest seconds philanthropy. The Negro must be educated not only for his sake, but for ours.

With the help of the board, he founded another experimental school, the [[New Lincoln School#History|Lincoln School]], which opened in 1917, in cooperation with the faculty at [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]] of [[Columbia University]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Institute for Advanced Study===\n{{main|Institute for Advanced Study}}\n[[File:Albert Einstein and Abraham Flexner at the Institute for Advanced Study.jpg|thumb|right|260px|left to right: [[Albert Einstein]], Abraham Flexner, John R.

Flexner informed them that a teaching hospital and other faculties required a successful school. A few months later, in June 1930, he had persuaded the Bamberger siblings and their representatives to fund instead the development of an Institute for Advanced Study.<ref name=\"ias.edu\" />\n\nThe Institute was headed by Flexner from 1930 to 1939 and it possessed a renowned faculty including [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] and [[John von Neumann]].\n\nDuring his time there, Flexner helped bring over many European scientists who would likely have suffered persecution by the rising [[Nazi]] government. This included [[Albert Einstein]], who arrived at the Institute in 1933 under Flexner's directorship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abraham Flexner|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/210137/Abraham-Flexner|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc}}</ref>\n\n===''Universities: American, English, German''===\nIn his 1930 ''Universities: American, English, German'',<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/universitiesamer008115mbp | title=Universities American English German| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1930}}</ref> Flexner returned to his earlier interest in the direction and purpose of the American university, attacking distractions from serious learning, such as [[College athletics|intercollegiate athletics]], [[Students' union|student government]], and other student activities.\n\n==Legacy==\n* The ''[[Flexner Report]]'' and his work in education has had a lasting impact on medical and higher education.

He was the sixth of nine children born to German Jewish immigrants, Ester and Moritz Flexner.<ref name=\"Autobiography\">''Abraham Flexner: An Autobiography'', New York: SImon and Schuster, 1960, pp. 2\u20134.</ref> He was the first in his family to complete high school and go on to college.<ref name=\"Bonner\" /> In 1886, at age 19, Flexner completed a Bachelor of Arts in [[classics]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he studied for only two years. In 1905, he pursued graduate studies in [[psychology]] at [[Harvard University]], and at the [[University of Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2003/ms003042.pdf |title=Abraham Flexner Papers \u2013 A Finding Aid to the Collection in the Library of Congress |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |page=4 |date=April 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}</ref> He did not, however, complete work on an advanced degree at either institution.\n\n===Personal life===\nFlexner had three brothers named Jacob, Bernard and Simon Flexner. He also had a sister named Rachel Flexner.<ref name=\"ias.edu\">{{cite web|title=Abraham Flexner|url=https://www.ias.edu/people/flexner |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study}}</ref>\n\nThe success of Abraham Flexner's experimental schooling allowed him to help finance [[Simon Flexner]]'s medical education at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]]. He proceeded to become a pathologist, bacteriologist and a medical researcher employed by the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]] from 1901 to 1935.<ref name=\"ias.edu\" />\n\n[[File:aflexner21.jpg|thumb|right|Flexner circa 1895]]\nFlexner also financed his sister's undergraduate studies at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. Jacob ran a drugstore and used the profits from selling the establishment to attend medical school. He then practiced as a physician in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. Bernard pursued a career in law and later practiced in both Chicago and New York.<ref name=\"ias.edu\" />\n\nIn 1896, Flexner married a former student of his school, [[Anne Crawford Flexner|Anne Laziere Crawford]]. She was a teacher who soon became a successful playwright and children's author. The success of her play ''Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch'' (based on the [[Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch|1901 novel]]) funded Flexner's studies at Harvard and his year abroad at European universities. The couple had two daughters Jean and Eleanor. Jean went on to become one of the original employees of the United States Division of Labor Standards. [[Eleanor Flexner]] became an independent scholar and pioneer of women's studies.<ref name=\"ias.edu\" />\n\nFlexner grew up in an [[Orthodox Jew]]ish family, however, early on he became a religious agnostic.<ref name=\"Bonner\" />\n\nIn addition to contributions by his brother Simon, their nephew, [[Louis B. Flexner|Louis Barkhouse Flexner]], was founding director of the Mahoney Institute of Neurological Sciences at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and a former editor of the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Death===\nFlexner died in [[Falls Church, Virginia]], in 1959 at 92 years of age. He was buried in [[Cave Hill Cemetery]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref name=\"ias.edu\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Experimental schooling===\nAfter graduating from Johns Hopkins University in two years with a degree in classics, Flexner returned to Louisville to teach classics at [[Louisville Male High School]]. Four years later, Flexner founded a private school in which he would test his growing ideas about education. Flexner opposed the standard model of education that focused on mental discipline and a rigid structure. Moreover, \"Mr. Flexner's School\" did not give out traditional grades, used no standard curriculum, refused to impose examinations on students, and kept no academic record of students. Instead, it promoted small learning groups, individual development, and a more hands-on approach to education. Graduates of his school were soon accepted at leading colleges, and his teaching style began to attract considerable attention.<ref name=\"Bonner\" />\n\n===''The American College''===\nIn 1908, Flexner published his first book, ''The American College''. Strongly critical of many aspects of American higher education, it denounced, in particular, the university lecture as a method of instruction. According to Flexner, lectures enabled colleges to \"handle cheaply by wholesale a large body of students that would be otherwise unmanageable and thus give the lecturer time for research.\" In addition, Flexner was concerned about the chaotic condition of the undergraduate curriculum and the influence of the research culture of the university. Neither contributed to the mission of the college to address the whole person. He feared that \"research had largely appropriated the resources of the college, substituting the methods and interest of highly specialized investigation for the larger objects of college teaching.\"<ref>Abraham Flexner, ''The American College'', New York: The Century Company, 1908, pp. 215\u2013216</ref>\n\nHis book attracted the attention of [[Henry Pritchett]], president of the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]], who was looking for someone to lead a series of studies of professional education. The book consistently cited Pritchett in discussions of views on educational reform, and the two soon arranged to meet through the then-president of [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Ira Remsen]]. Although Flexner had never set foot inside a medical school, he was Pritchett's first choice to lead a study of American medical education, and soon joined the research staff at the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] in 1908. Although not a physician himself, Flexner was selected by Pritchett for his writing ability and his disdain for traditional education.<ref name=\"Bonner\" />\n\n===''Flexner Report''===\n{{main|Flexner Report}}\nIn 1910, Flexner published the ''Flexner Report'', which examined the state of American medical education and led to far-reaching reform in the training of doctors. The ''Flexner Report'' led to the closure of most rural medical schools and all but two African-American medical colleges in the United States, given his adherence to [[germ theory]], in which he argued that if not properly trained and treated, African-Americans and the poor posed a health threat to middle/upper class European-Americans.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Beck AH |title=The Flexner Report and the standardization of American medical education|journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=291|pages=2139\u20132140|doi=10.1001/jama.291.17.2139 |year=2004 |pmid=15126445|issue=17}}</ref>  His position was:\n{{quote|The practice of the Negro doctor will be limited to his own race, which in its turn will be cared for better by good Negro physicians than by poor white ones.

Not only does the Negro himself suffer from hookworm and tuberculosis; he communicates them to his white neighbors, precisely as the ignorant and unfortunate white contaminates him. Self-protection not less than humanity offers weighty counsel in this matter; self-interest seconds philanthropy. The Negro must be educated not only for his sake, but for ours.

With the help of the board, he founded another experimental school, the [[New Lincoln School#History|Lincoln School]], which opened in 1917, in cooperation with the faculty at [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]] of [[Columbia University]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Institute for Advanced Study===\n{{main|Institute for Advanced Study}}\n[[File:Albert Einstein and Abraham Flexner at the Institute for Advanced Study.jpg|thumb|right|260px|left to right: [[Albert Einstein]], Abraham Flexner, John R.

Flexner informed them that a teaching hospital and other faculties required a successful school. A few months later, in June 1930, he had persuaded the Bamberger siblings and their representatives to fund instead the development of an Institute for Advanced Study.<ref name=\"ias.edu\" />\n\nThe Institute was headed by Flexner from 1930 to 1939 and it possessed a renowned faculty including [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] and [[John von Neumann]].\n\nDuring his time there, Flexner helped bring over many European scientists who would likely have suffered persecution by the rising [[Nazi]] government.
