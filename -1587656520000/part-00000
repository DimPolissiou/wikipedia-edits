The first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to serve as governor of Kentucky, Bradley became known as the father of the Republican Party in Kentucky.<ref name=thatcherxi>Thatcher, p. xi</ref>\n\nAs a Republican in a heavily [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state, Bradley found little success early in his political career. He was defeated for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and in the United States Senate twice each. After rising to national prominence with his speech seconding the presidential nomination of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] at the [[1880 Republican National Convention]], he was nominated for governor in 1887. Although he lost the contest to [[Simon Bolivar Buckner]], he reduced the usual Democratic majority substantially. He was again nominated for governor in 1895. Capitalizing on divisions in the Democratic Party over the issue of [[free silver]], he defeated [[Parker Watkins Hardin]] in the general election. His term was marked by political struggles and violence. He was an advocate for [[African Americans|blacks]] and did much to advance their status in the state, but was unable to enact much of his reform agenda because of a hostile Democratic majority in the state legislature.\n\nRepublican [[William S. Taylor (Kentucky politician)|William S. Taylor]] was elected to succeed Bradley in the contentious [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 1899|1899 gubernatorial election]]. When Democratic nominee [[William Goebel]] and his running mate [[J. C. W. Beckham]] challenged the election results, Bradley formed part of the legal team for the Republicans. [[Taylor v. Beckham|The case]] was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], which found in favor of the Democrats. Despite being a member of the state's minority party, Bradley was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1907. Again, divisions within the Democratic Party played a role in his election. Bradley's opposition to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] made him more palatable to some Democrats than their own candidate, outgoing Governor Beckham. Beckham refused to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate, and after two months of balloting, four Democratic legislators crossed party lines and elected Bradley. Bradley had a largely undistinguished career in the Senate. On the day he announced he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, he was involved in a [[streetcar]] accident. He died from his injuries on May 23, 1914.\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam O'Connell Bradley was born near [[Lancaster, Kentucky|Lancaster]] in [[Garrard County, Kentucky]], on March 18, 1847.<ref name=congbio>\"Bradley, William O'Connell\". ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress''</ref> He was the youngest child of Robert McAfee and Nancy Ellen (Totten) Bradley.<ref name=powell>Powell, p. 72</ref> The couple also had six daughters, five of whom survived infancy, and one other son, who died as an infant.<ref name=thatchervii>Thatcher, p. vii</ref> Bradley's sister, Catherine Virginia (Bradley) Morrow, married Judge [[Thomas Z. Morrow]], who made an unsuccessful run for the governorship of Kentucky in 1883; their son, [[Edwin P. Morrow]], was elected the 40th governor of Kentucky in 1917.<ref name=thatchervii />\n\nWhile Bradley was still a child, the family moved to [[Somerset, Kentucky]], where Bradley was educated by private tutors and at a private school.<ref name=congbio /><ref name=powell /> After the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he twice dropped out of school and ran away to join the [[Union Army]], first serving as a recruiting officer in Somerset, then enlisting as a private soldier in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]].<ref name=perrin>Perrin, Battle, and Kiffin, ''Kentucky: A History of the State''</ref> Both times, his father removed him from the service because of his young age.<ref name=johnson673>E. Johnson, p. 673</ref> Despite having only this few months of service to his credit, he was referred to as \"Colonel Bradley\" by many for the rest of his life.<ref name=wiltz120>Wiltz, p. 120</ref>\n\nIn 1861, Bradley became a page in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].<ref name=thatchervii /> He studied law under his father, one of Kentucky's leading criminal defense lawyers.<ref name=powell /> Although Kentucky law required that anyone taking the [[bar examination]] be at least twenty-one years old, Bradley was allowed by a special provision of the state legislature to take it at age eighteen.<ref name=powell /> This arrangement was contingent on Bradley's being judged competent by two circuit judges.<ref name=powell /> Despite having no college education, Bradley passed the exam and was licensed in 1865, joining his father's firm in Lancaster.<ref name=congbio /><ref name=powell /> He later received an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from Kentucky University (now [[Transylvania University]]).<ref name=thatcherix>Thatcher, p. ix</ref>\n\nOn July 13, 1867,<ref>Powell and Perrin record the date as July 11</ref> Bradley married Margaret Robertson Duncan, and subsequently converted from [[Baptism]] to [[Presbyterianism]], his wife's faith. The couple had two children, George Robertson Bradley and Christine (Bradley) South.<ref>Thatcher, p. viii, xix</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nBradley's political career began in 1870, when he was elected [[county attorney|prosecuting attorney]] of Garrard County.<ref name=congbio /> A Republican in the heavily Democratic [[Kentucky's 8th congressional district|Eighth District]], Bradley was defeated by [[Milton J. Durham]] for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1872.<ref name=klotter127>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 127</ref><ref name=mcafee24>McAfee, p. 24</ref><ref name=stealey68>Stealey, p. 68</ref> In 1875, his party honored him with a nomination to serve in the U.S. Senate, even though he was too young to legally qualify for the office.<ref name=mcafee24 /> Nevertheless, he received the vote of every Republican in the state legislature.<ref name=perrin /> The following year, he again lost to Durham for a seat in the House of Representatives, but received 3,000 more votes than any Republican candidate had ever received in that district.<ref name=perrin /> He refused his party's nomination for the Senate in 1878 and 1882, and declined a nomination for [[Attorney General of Kentucky|state attorney general]] in 1879 because of ill health.<ref name=mcafee24 />\n\nBradley was unanimously chosen as a delegate-at-large to six consecutive [[Republican National Convention]]s.<ref name=johnson673 /> At the [[1880 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], he was unanimously chosen to second [[Roscoe Conkling]]'s nomination of Ulysses S. Grant for a third term as president.<ref name=mcafee24 /> His rousing oratory gained him the attention of prominent leaders of his party.<ref name=mcafee24 /> At the [[1884 Republican National Convention|1884 convention]], he was instrumental in defeating a motion to curtail [[Southern United States|Southern states']] representation.<ref name=johnson673 /> President [[Chester A. Arthur]] chose Bradley to help recover financial damages from postal officials involved in the [[Star routes|Star Route Frauds]] in 1885, but Bradley resigned this responsibility over differences with [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Benjamin H. Brewster]] regarding the prosecution of these cases.<ref name=perrin />\n\n==Gubernatorial election of 1887==\nAt their nominating convention in Louisville on May 11, 1887, Kentucky Republicans nominated Bradley for Governor of Kentucky to oppose Democrat [[Simon B. Buckner]], a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general.<ref>Tapp and Klotter, pp. 229\u2013231</ref> In his acceptance speech, Bradley implored Kentuckians to realize that the Civil War was over and to discontinue their practice of electing ex-Confederate Democrats to public office.<ref name=tapp231>Tapp and Klotter, p. 231</ref> His platform included proposals for education, implementing of a high protective tariff, and developing the state's resources.<ref name=kye>Harrison, p. 112</ref> He pointed out that, though Kentucky contained more coal than [[Pennsylvania]], the state bought half of its coal from that state.<ref name=tapp231 /> A similar situation existed with regard to lumber.<ref name=tapp231 /> He was also critical of excessive spending during the preceding Democratic administrations.<ref name=kye /> Among his cited examples of extravagance were the creation of a state bureau of agriculture and the construction of a new [[Kentucky State Penitentiary|state penitentiary]].<ref name=klotter128>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 128</ref> Democratic mismanagement of the state's affairs had resulted in able, young Kentuckians leaving the state to seek their fortunes because of a lack of opportunity at home, Bradley lamented.<ref name=tapp232>Tapp and Klotter, p. 232</ref>\n\n[[File:Governor Simon B Buckner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Simon Bolivar Buckner, Bradley's opponent in 1887|alt=A color portrait of an older gentleman with white hair and a white goatee]]\nDuring the campaign, Buckner relied on party strength and personal popularity to give him an advantage over Bradley, a decidedly superior orator. In the only debate between the two, held at [[Grayson, Kentucky|Grayson]], Bradley attacked Democrats for creating \"useless offices\" such as railroad commissioners. He defended the Republican proposal of a high protective tariff and advocated federal aid for education. When Buckner took the platform, he began by asking if Bradley had charged in an earlier speech that one of Buckner's speeches had been written by former governor [[J. Proctor Knott]]. Bradley acknowledged that he had heard that Knott had written the speech and that he (Bradley) had repeated this claim in one of his speeches. Buckner rebuked Bradley for circulating this \"infamously false\" charge, and withdrew his agreement to participate in any further joint debates. He then delivered a discourse attacking the protective tariff and federal aid for education.<ref>Tapp and Klotter, pp. 232, 234</ref>\n\nTrue to his word, Buckner never again met Bradley in a joint debate.<ref name=tapp234>Tapp and Klotter, p. 234</ref> Rumors began to circulate that Buckner was afraid to meet Bradley in debate again, and Bradley did little to dispel these rumors.<ref name=tapp234 /> The Democrats were not completely united throughout the campaign, with prominent members of the party, including Milton J. Durham and [[Kentucky Senate|State Senator]] Albert Seaton Berry, criticizing the Democratic record in the state.<ref name=tapp234 /> The Democratic ''[[Henderson Gleaner]]'' was also critical, opining \"We should be ashamed of ourselves.\"<ref name=tapp234 /> Throughout the state, Bradley hammered the issue of the blind trust afforded the perennial Democratic officeholders, specifically calling for an examination of the treasury.<ref name=tapp234 /> Though Bradley lost the election by more than 16,000 votes, he made the best showing of any Republican gubernatorial candidate to that time and garnered strong support from the state's [[African Americans|black]] voters.<ref name=klotter128 /> His concerns about the state treasury proved valid: When Buckner ordered an audit of the treasurer's books in 1888, Treasurer [[James \"Honest Dick\" Tate]] fled with $250,000 from the state treasury.<ref name=tapp242>Tapp and Klotter, p. 242</ref> He was never found.<ref name=nhok264>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 264</ref>\n\nIn 1888, Bradley's name was again put before the General Assembly as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, but he was defeated by [[James B. Beck]] by a vote of 94\u201331.<ref name=tapp245>Tapp and Klotter, p. 245</ref> Later that year, he received 103 of 832 votes for the Vice-Presidential nomination at the [[1888 Republican National Convention]], losing the nomination to [[Levi P. Morton]].<ref name=johnson233>C. Johnson, p. 233 (Powell gives the number of votes for Bradley as 105.)</ref> Upon the unsolicited recommendation of Senator Beck, President [[Benjamin Harrison]] nominated Bradley as Minister to [[Korea]] in 1889, but Bradley declined the nomination, opting to remain in Kentucky and pursue future political opportunities there.<ref name=stealey68 /> He was elected to the [[Republican National Committee]] three times between 1890 and 1896.<ref name=congbio /><ref name=johnson673 /> In 1896, he was the Kentucky delegation's choice for Presidential nominee.<ref name=powell />\n\n==Gubernatorial election of 1895==\nBradley declared his candidacy early for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895, and no real challenger emerged prior to the Republicans' nominating convention.<ref name=wiltz120 /> Consequently, Bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention.<ref name=klotter128 /> The major issue of the campaign was whether the country should maintain a monetary system based on the [[gold standard]] or allow the coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1, commonly called the [[free silver]] position.<ref name=wiltz118>Wiltz, p. 118</ref> At their convention, the Republicans adopted a platform that was unequivocally in favor of the gold standard.<ref name=wiltz125>Wiltz, p. 125</ref>\n\n[[File:Parker-Watkins-Hardin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man in his forties with black hair and a long mustache wearing a white shirt and black coat, facing right|Parker Watkins Hardin, Bradley's opponent in 1895]]\nDemocrats were divided on the monetary issue. Their eventual nominee, [[Parker Watkins Hardin]], was known to be a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President [[Grover Cleveland]] and his [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|treasury secretary]], native Kentuckian [[John G. Carlisle]], both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like [[Ollie M. James]] contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on the money question.<ref>Wiltz, pp. 118, 123\u2013124, 126</ref>\n\nThe campaign opened in Louisville on August 19, 1895. In his first address, Hardin came out squarely for free silver, ensuring the division of his party for the rest of the campaign. Bradley reprised much of his argument from the 1887 campaign against Buckner. He charged mismanagement of state government by Democrats, citing Tate's [[defalcation]] as evidence. He also stressed Hardin's association with Tate; Hardin had been the state's attorney general when Tate absconded, and the two were known to be friends. He denounced free silver and again called for a high protective tariff. He blamed Democratic President Cleveland for [[Panic of 1893|the national depression]].<ref>Wiltz, pp. 120, 127</ref>\n\nIn the third debate, held in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky|Hopkinsville]], Hardin countered Bradley's offensive against him on the money issue by charging that the election of a Republican would lead to \"Negro domination\" of the state. This put Bradley in a dilemma. If he refused to acknowledge blacks' influence on the party, he would lose their votes; if he acknowledged it, he would lose many white voters. Bradley attempted to ignore the racial question in Hopkinsville and during the next two debates, instead intensifying his criticism of Hardin on the money question and his association with Tate. In the sixth joint debate, held August 30 at [[Eminence, Kentucky|Eminence]], some members of the audience began to heckle Bradley, who was hoarse from previous debates. After attempting to restart his opening statement four times, Bradley left the platform, and the next day announced he would not participate in any further joint debates as a result of the incident. Many believed Bradley was looking for a reason to end the debates in order to dodge the racial question, and the incident at Eminence gave him the opportunity. Some black Republicans resented Bradley's attempt to dodge the racial question and encouraged fellow blacks not to support Bradley but vote for [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] [[Thomas S. Pettit]] instead.<ref>Wiltz, pp. 128, 131</ref>\n\nIn the general election, Bradley carried the vote of many [[National Democratic Party (United States)|Gold Democrats]].<ref name=klotter128 /> He also drew a number of votes from those who sympathized with the views of the [[American Protective Association]], an anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic organization.<ref name=klotter128 /> Some estimates placed the organization's membership at 14,000 in Louisville alone; it also had strength in the urban centers of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]], [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]], [[Covington, Kentucky|Covington]], and Frankfort.<ref name=wiltz129>Wiltz, p. 129</ref> Democrats were also hurt by economic factors, including the national economic problems and a severe drought in the state.<ref name=klotter129>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 129</ref> Bradley was elected the first Republican governor of Kentucky, defeating Hardin by a vote of 172,436 to 163,524.<ref name=kye /><ref name=klotter129 /> Pettit, the Populist candidate, drew 16,911 votes, most of them from Democrats in western Kentucky.<ref name=klotter129 /> Turnout in the election was 85%.<ref name=wiltz132>Wiltz, p. 132</ref> More votes than potential voters were registered in 18 counties, nine of which went for Bradley and nine for Hardin.<ref name=wiltz132 />\n\n==Governor of Kentucky==\nBradley was inaugurated December 10, 1895.<ref name=wiltz134>Wiltz, p. 134</ref> During his term, Republicans controlled the Kentucky House of Representatives, while Democrats controlled the Kentucky Senate.<ref name=kye /> This led to infighting between the two houses of the General Assembly and between the General Assembly and the governor. On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties were even with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one who supported the Democrats and another who supported the Republicans.<ref name=wiltz132 />\n\n===Legislative session of 1896===\nIn the first legislative session of Bradley's term, 75 bills were filed, including a ban on the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, a measure to make carrying a [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed weapon]] a [[felony]], and a bill banning gambling at racetracks and church fairs. Competing measures affecting [[Billiard hall|pool halls]] were introduced \u2013 one would have lifted most of the restrictions on their operation while another would have banned them altogether. Bradley added an anti-[[lynching]] law to the legislative agenda. However, none of these bills were acted on; the vast majority of the Assembly's attention during the session was focused on the election of a U.S. Senator.<ref name=reis4k>Reis, p. 4K</ref>\n\n[[File:Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man in his forties with black hair and a bushy, black mustache. He is standing, facing right, and holding a can in his right hand, a hat in his left, and wearing a long black coat|The election of a successor to Senator J. C. S. Blackburn dominated the first legislative session of Bradley's term.]]\nMany Democrats were anxious to return Senator [[Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn|J. C. S. Blackburn]] to his seat in Congress, but some were instead supporting ex-Governor [[John Y. Brown (politician, born 1835)|John Y. Brown]].<ref name=reis4k /> Democratic state senator Albert Berry was also making overtures about being considered for the seat.<ref name=reis4k /> Republican legislators nominated [[W. Godfrey Hunter]] for the seat, and ultimately, Blackburn and Hunter emerged as the leading candidates.<ref name=klotter129 /><ref name=reis4k /> The Gold Democrats refused to back Blackburn, a free silver supporter, instead opting for ex-Governor [[James B. McCreary]].<ref name=tapp356>Tapp and Klotter, p. 356</ref> On ballot after ballot, no candidate received a majority, though Blackburn received 65 votes once, leaving him just two votes shy of election.<ref name=reis4k /> Treasury Secretary John G. Carlisle was put forward as a compromise candidate, but never received more than 61 votes.<ref name=reis4k /> Other proposed compromise candidates included ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' editor [[Henry Watterson]], congressman [[Walter Evans (American politician)|Walter Evans]], ex-Governor Buckner, Judge [[William H. Holt]], and [[Augustus E. Willson]].<ref name=tapp357>Tapp and Klotter, p. 357</ref>\n\nFree silver Democrats challenged Hunter's [[naturalization]].<ref name=tapp357 /> It was finally concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions of a federal law that allowed him to omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army.<ref name=tapp357 /> Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was [[acquittal|acquitted]] in short order for lack of evidence.<ref name=tapp357 /> Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates.<ref name=reis4k /> A ''[[Kentucky Post]]'' account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations.<ref name=reis4k /> This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through the air.<ref name=reis4k /> By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were standing outside the [[Old State Capitol (Kentucky)|state house]] in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering.<ref name=reis4k /> Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence.<ref name=klotter129 /> Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.<ref name=reis4k />\n\nBradley called the [[militia]] to Frankfort to maintain order, and considered adjourning the session to an opera house in Louisville where more security could be provided.<ref name=reis4k /> Some leading Democrats in Louisville lauded Bradley for preserving order, but Democratic lawmakers in the Senate sought the passage of resolutions to convict Bradley of interference with the election, fine him $500, and sentence him to six months in jail.<ref name=tapp359>Tapp and Klotter, p. 359</ref> These same legislators also threatened to imprison [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|Lieutenant Governor]] [[William Jackson Worthington]], allowing Democratic [[President pro tempore of the Kentucky Senate|President pro tem of the Senate]] [[William Goebel]] to become acting governor.<ref name=tapp359 /> A committee was appointed to investigate Bradley, but the resolutions to convict and imprison him were not passed.<ref name=tapp359 /> On March 16, Governor Bradley declared [[martial law]] in the capital.<ref name=reis4k /> The session adjourned later that day without having elected a senator.<ref name=klotter129 /> Among the session's few accomplishments were bills creating two reform houses in the state and providing for free turnpikes and gravel roads.<ref name=tapp360>Tapp and Klotter, p. 360</ref> A bill forbidding the employment of children of school age who had not attended at least twelve weeks of school during the year passed over Bradley's veto.<ref name=kye /><ref name=tapp360 /> In an effort to embarrass the governor, the Senate refused to pass a revenue bill, leaving the governor with no money to run the state.<ref name=tapp360 /> Following the session, a [[Northern Kentucky]] newspaper opined \"It is hard to conceive how a legislature would go about accomplishing less than this present one has.\"<ref name=reis4k />\n\nBradley called a special session in March 1897 to resume the balloting for senator.<ref name=klotter129 /> He appointed Andrew T. Wood to fill the vacancy in case the legislators did not elect a senator in time for the congressional session to begin.<ref name=tapp364>Tapp and Klotter, p. 364</ref> The Republicans continued supporting Hunter, Free Silver Democrats still backed Blackburn, and Gold Democrats nominated businessman Henry L. Martin of [[Woodford County, Kentucky|Woodford County]].<ref name=tapp365 /> When continued deadlock between Hunter and Blackburn ensued, Hunter withdrew his name from consideration.<ref name=tapp365>Tapp and Klotter, p. 365</ref> Republicans nominated St. John Boyle, but the gridlock continued unabated.<ref name=tapp365 /> After several ballots, Boyle also withdrew, and Republicans put forth lawyer and State senator [[William Joseph Deboe]] in his place.<ref name=tapp365 /> Deboe was elected on the 112th ballot, becoming the first Republican senator from the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]].<ref name=klotter129 />\n\n===Advocacy for blacks===\nBradley did much to advance the cause of blacks in Kentucky. He denounced racially motivated lynchings and demanded that county officials prosecute racial violence.<ref name=lucas91 /> He called a special legislative session in March 1897 to consider an anti-lynching bill that imposed penalties including a fine of up to $500 and removal from office for any peace officer who did not prevent a lynching or mob violence.<ref name=lucas81>Lucas and Wright, p. 81</ref> It further empowered peace officers to recruit able-bodied men to help protect prisoners and fined them for failing to do so, if necessary.<ref name=lucas81 /> Despite the politically divided legislature, the bill quickly passed both houses of the General Assembly and Bradley signed it on May 11, 1897.<ref name=lucas82>Lucas and Wright, p. 82</ref> In January 1898, Bradley accepted an invitation to speak before the Anti-Mob and Lynch Law Association in [[Springfield, Ohio]].<ref name=lucas91 /> During Bradley's four-year term, twenty-five lynchings were committed in the state, down from fifty-six during the term of his predecessor.<ref name=wright179>Wright, p. 179</ref>\n\nOne high-profile case that illustrated Bradley's opposition to racial violence was that of ex-[[Slavery in the United States|slave]] George Dinning. After being emancipated, Dining saved enough money to purchase a farm in [[Simpson County, Kentucky|Simpson County]]. On January 27, 1897, a mob of 25&nbsp;armed white men came to Dinning's farm, accused him of stealing hogs and chickens, and demanded he leave the county within 10&nbsp;days. Dining denied being a thief and insisted several people in the county would vouch for his good character. The mob, enraged by Dinning's resistance, began firing on his house and wounded him twice. Dining retrieved a gun from his house and fired into the mob, killing one man. The mob fled, and the next day, Dining turned himself in to local officials. While he was in their custody, the mob returned to his farm, drove his family from their house, looted it, and razed it to the ground.<ref>Wright, pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nThe Simpson County sheriff moved Dining to [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] and eventually to Louisville to prevent him from being lynched. Governor Bradley dispatched a squad of the state militia to protect him while his trial proceeded. Despite the fact that the case involved a black man killing a white man, most observers believed Dining would be acquitted on grounds of [[self-defense]]. The jury, however, convicted Dining of [[manslaughter]] and sentenced him to seven years of [[Penal labour|hard labor]]. Immediately, Bradley's office was flooded with requests for him to intervene on Dinning's behalf. The requests came from blacks and whites, some of them ex-Confederates. Dinning's attorney, Augustus E. Willson, formally requested a [[pardon]], and Bradley issued it 10&nbsp;days after the conviction. Bradley opined that Dining had acted reasonably under the circumstances and that it was a shame that no members of the mob were charged. After being freed, Dining relocated to [[Indiana]] and hired ex-Confederate [[Bennett H. Young]] to file a federal lawsuit against some members of the mob that had identified themselves during his trial. The trial was held in Louisville, and Dining was awarded $50,000 in damages.<ref>Wright, pp. 15\u201317</ref>\n\nIn his address to the state legislature in January 1898, Bradley advocated the repeal of the state's Separate Coach Law, which provided separate streetcars for whites and blacks.<ref name=lucas91>Lucas and Wright, p. 91</ref> He appointed substantial numbers of blacks to patronage positions in government beyond the janitorial jobs they usually received.<ref name=lucas90>Lucas and Wright, p. 90</ref> He named Edward E.

Bradley\". National Governors Association</ref> Both houses passed a resolution calling for the resignation of Senator [[William Lindsay (Kentucky politician)|William Lindsay]], a Gold Democrat who did not support [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s presidential bid, on grounds that he no longer represented the interests of his party.<ref name=tapp370 /> Lindsay responded that he represented the people of Kentucky and refused to resign his seat.<ref name=tapp370 />\n\n[[File:Old Kentucky Governor's Mansion.jpg|thumb|left|The governor's mansion was damaged by a fire during Bradley's term]]\nAnother of Bradley's concerns in his message to the legislature was the condition of the [[Old Governor's Mansion (Frankfort, Kentucky)|Governor's Mansion]]. In his address, he declared \"As to the Executive Mansion, for years its floors have been propped up to prevent them from falling, and it required more than seven hundred feet of weather strips to make it comfortable in the winter. The present site is disagreeable, the view from one side overlooks the walls of the penitentiary, and from the other the smokestack of a large flouring mill nearby.\"<ref name=clark65>Clark and Lane, p. 65</ref> Instead of addressing Bradley's concerns, the General Assembly passed a \"ripper bill\" taking control of the mansion from the governor and putting it under the supervision of the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]]. On February 10, 1899, the mansion caught fire as a result of a faulty flue in the governor's bedroom. The day was so cold that the fireman had difficulty keeping the water in their hoses unfrozen, and the mansion suffered extensive damage. Though the mansion was insured and a reporter for the ''Courier-Journal'' opined that the sensible thing to do would be to demolish the old structure and construct a new one or purchase another house in Frankfort to serve as the governor's mansion, the legislature was disinclined to make more than minimal accommodations for a Republican governor. Consequently, the mansion was once again repaired. The Bradleys stayed with a neighbor in Frankfort immediately after the fire. Thereafter, Governor Bradley stayed in Frankfort's Capitol Hotel, while Mrs. Bradley and daughter Christine returned to the family's home in Lancaster. The family re-occupied the residence prior to the end of Bradley's term.<ref>Clark and Lane, pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nBradley struggled to end violent feuds that continued in the eastern part of the state. During his term, the so-called \"Tollgate Wars\" were ongoing. In many rural areas that could not afford to build good roads, private companies had built the roads and attempted to recover the costs and turn a profit by charging tolls. Poor residents of the areas, however, maintained that the tolls were excessive, especially in light of the [[Panic of 1896|national depression]]. They began to call for \"free roads\", but their calls went unheeded by the state and national governments. Many then resorted to violence, burning toll houses and threatening and attacking toll collectors. Bradley called for harsh action against this lawlessness, but the Democratic General Assembly, sympathetic to the plight of the poor residents of the state, refused to act. By the end of Bradley's term, most of the violence had ended, as companies sold their stock to local groups or simply abandoned their roads due to the violence.<ref>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', pp. 268\u2013269</ref>\n\nKentucky's four infantry regiments and two cavalry units that served in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] were beset by poor sanitation and disease in the army camps where they were stationed. The units saw little action in the war, but 84&nbsp;men died as a result of the poor conditions. When the time came for the troops to return home, Bradley found that the state had no money to pay for the hospital trains needed for their trip. Bradley personally borrowed money from a bank to secure their passage, and trusted that the General Assembly would reimburse him.<ref name=harrison269>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 269</ref>\n\n===Goebel Election Law; gubernatorial election of 1899===\n{{Main|Kentucky gubernatorial election, 1899}}\nOn February 1, 1898, Senate President Pro Tem William Goebel sponsored a measure later referred to as the Goebel Election Law.<ref name=gel378>Kleber, \"Goebel Election Law\", p. 378</ref> The bill created a Board of Election Commissioners, appointed by the General Assembly, who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky's counties.<ref name=gel378 /> The board was empowered to examine election returns and rule on the results.<ref name=gel378 /> The power to decide the outcome of disputed elections remained with the General Assembly, pursuant to Section 153 of the [[Kentucky Constitution|state constitution]].<ref name=section153>Kentucky Constitution, Section 153</ref> Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic and Goebel was considered a likely Democratic aspirant for the governorship in the 1899 election, the bill was attacked as blatantly partisan and self-serving, even by some Democrats.<ref name=harrison270>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 270</ref> Nevertheless, Goebel was able to hold enough members of his party together to override Bradley's veto, making the bill law.<ref name=harrison270 />\n\nA proposal was made to call a special session to repeal the law, and Bradley was in favor of the action, but a poll of the legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal to justify the call. Republicans organized a [[Test case (law)|test case]] against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats \u2013 W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; [[William Thomas Ellis|W. T. Ellis]], former U. S. Representative from [[Daviess County, Kentucky|Daviess County]]; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission.<ref name=hughes7>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, pp. 7\u20138, 47</ref>\n\n[[File:William Sylvester Taylor.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A man in his late forties with black hair and a mustache. He is wearing a tightly-buttoned black coat and facing left.|William S. Taylor was the Republican nominee to succeed Bradley.]]\nAs Bradley's term drew to a close, potential Republican candidates to succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]] as a sure sign that the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law.<ref name=hughes50>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 50</ref><!--cites previous 4 sentences--> Sitting attorney general [[William S. Taylor (Kentucky politician)|William S. Taylor]] was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe.<ref name=hughes50 /><ref name=tapp425>Tapp and Klotter, p. 425</ref> Later candidates included [[Hopkins County, Kentucky|Hopkins County]] judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone.<ref name=hughes50 /> The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong [[political machine]] amongst the county delegations.<ref name=tapp425 /> He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.<ref name=tapp425 />\n\nThe Republican nominating convention convened on July 12 in Lexington.<ref name=hughes52>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 52</ref> Angry that his party had not more seriously considered his candidate, Bradley did not attend. Black leaders in the party threatened to follow Bradley and organize their own nominating convention, as they believed Taylor represented the \"lily-white\" branch of the party. Taylor attempted to hold the party together by making one of the black leaders permanent secretary of the convention and promising to appoint other black leaders to his cabinet if elected. He also tried to bring Bradley back to the convention by promising to nominate Bradley's nephew, Edwin P. Morrow, for secretary of state. Bradley refused the offer.<ref name=tapp425 /><!--cites previous 5 sentences--> In the face of Taylor's superior organization, all the other candidates withdrew in a show of party unity, allowing Taylor to be nominated unanimously.<ref name=hughes53>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 53</ref>\n\nBradley had initially been cool toward Taylor, but he agreed to tour the state with Republican leader Augustus E. Willson after Goebel, the eventual Democratic nominee, made a similar tour with William Jennings Bryan, who was wildly popular in the state. Although he insisted he only wanted to defend his administration from Democratic attacks, Henry Watterson suggested that Bradley was seeking to enlist Taylor's support for his anticipated senatorial bid. Bradley began his tour of the state in Louisville, charging that Democrats had to import an orator for their candidate because all of the state's best men had deserted him. He also encouraged blacks not to desert the Republican Party. He contrasted his appointments of blacks to his cabinet with the Democrats' support of the Separate Coach Bill. Throughout his speech, Bradley defended his administration and never once mentioned Taylor. Finally, he closed with the line \"And go to the polls and elect Taylor!\"<ref name=tapp439>Tapp and Klotter, p. 439</ref> As Bradley exited the stage, Willson whispered to him, \"Bradley, that's the slickest thing you ever did in your life.\"<ref name=tapp439 /> As they continued to tour the state, Bradley and Willson often drew crowds larger than those assembled for Taylor.<ref>Tapp and Klotter, pp. 437, 439</ref>\n\nAs the campaign drew to a close, both Republicans and Democrats warned of the possibility that [[electoral fraud]] and violence would be perpetrated by the other side. Louisville mayor [[Charles P. Weaver]], a Goebel Democrat, added 500 men to the city's police force just before the election, leading to charges that voter intimidation would occur in that city. Bradley countered by ordering the state militia to be ready to quell any disturbances across the state. On election day, the headline of the ''Courier-Journal'' proclaimed \"[[Bayonet]] Rule\".<ref>Tapp and Klotter, pp. 439\u2013440</ref>\n\nFor all the claims about the potential for violence, election day, November 7, remained mostly calm across the state.<ref name=tapp440>Tapp and Klotter, p. 440</ref> Fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide.<ref name=tapp440 /> Voting returns were slow, and on election night, the race was still too close to call.<ref name=harrison270 /> When the official tally was announced, Taylor had won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331.<ref name=harrison270 /> Former governor John Y. Brown, nominated by a dissident group of Democrats, had garnered 12,040 votes, and Populist candidate John G. Blair had captured 2,936.<ref name=harrison270 /> Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2\u20131 decision to certify the election results.<ref name=ga377>Klotter, \"Goebel Assassination\", p. 377</ref> The board's majority opinion claimed that they did not have any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses, leaving them without grounds to invalidate any votes.<ref name=tapp444>Tapp, p. 444</ref> Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899.<ref name=ga377 />\n\nFollowing his term as governor, Bradley moved to Louisville and resumed his legal practice. Shortly after Bradley left office, Goebel and his running mate, J. C. W. Beckham, challenged the results of the 1899 election in the General Assembly, per the state constitution.<ref name=hughes167>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 167</ref> All the candidates for the state's minor offices contested as well. Bradley and his colleague Augustus Willson formed part of the legal team that represented the Republicans before the General Assembly and in court, where they challenged the legality of the Goebel Election Law and, later, the actions of the General Assembly's contest committee.<ref name=hughes277>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 277</ref>\n\nRepublicans around the state expected the General Assembly's contest committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital, awaiting the contest committee's findings. On the morning of January 30, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, a shot rang out, and Goebel fell wounded. He was taken to a nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. As expected, the contest committee recommended invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor, and the General Assembly voted to certify the recommendation. Goebel was sworn in as governor, but he died on February 3. Beckham then took the oath of office and continued the legal challenge against Taylor and his lieutenant governor, [[John Marshall (Kentucky)|John Marshall]].<ref>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', pp. 271\u2013272</ref>\n\nIn federal court, Bradley argued on behalf of the Republican minor officers that the Goebel Election Law deprived citizens of their [[suffrage|right to vote]]. The right to vote, he claimed, was inherent in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s guarantee of \"liberty\", and could not be taken from any citizen without [[due process]].<ref>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, pp. 277\u2013278</ref> Federal judge [[William Howard Taft]] ruled that the Republicans would have to seek remedy in the state courts.<ref name=hughes282>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 282</ref> After a protracted legal battle, all of the minor officers were unseated except Attorney General Clifton J. Pratt.<ref name=tapp505>Tapp, p. 505</ref>\n\nThe cases of Taylor and Marshall were appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In the case of ''[[Taylor v. Beckham]]'', Bradley countered Democrats' claims that the federal courts should not have jurisdiction by citing ''[[Boyd v. State of Nebraska Thayer|Thayer v. Boyd]]'', a similar case in which the court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the General Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly on the grounds that it had left some members as judges of their own cases, Bradley argued. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including giving insufficient time for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. The court refused to intervene in the case, however, because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian [[John Marshall Harlan]].<ref>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, pp. 327\u2013328</ref>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn a joint ballot of the General Assembly in 1900, Bradley was defeated for a seat in the U.S. Senate by a vote of 75\u201354.<ref name=klotter130>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 130</ref> After the unseating of Taylor, the state Republican party split into factions, with Godfrey Hunter at the head of one and Bradley at the head of the other.<ref name=pip204>Klotter in ''Kentucky: Portrait in Paradox'', p. 204</ref> The two factions formed a tentative alliance to nominate [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]] law professor John W. Yerkes in the special election called after Goebel's assassination, but Yerkes lost to Democratic nominee J. C. W. Beckham.<ref name=pip204 /> At the [[1904 Republican National Convention]], Bradley was chosen to second the nomination of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for president.<ref name=powell />\n\nFactionalism again marked the Republican nominating convention in 1904. Bradley and his faction backed Augustus E. Willson for governor, while Hunter and Yerkes favored Louisville businessman [[Morris B. Belknap]], the son-in-law of former governor Simon Buckner. When convention officials ruled against a county delegation committed to Willson, he withdrew from the contest. Bradley was angered as Belknap was nominated on the first ballot and subsequently lost to J. C. W. Beckham, who was allowed to seek a second term because a court ruled he had not been elected to a full term in 1900.<ref name=pip206>Klotter in ''Kentucky: Portrait in Paradox'', p. 206</ref>\n\n===Career in the Senate===\n[[File:WilliamO'ConnellBradley.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A man in his mid-sixties, wearing a white suit and hat with a black bow tie, walking in front of a building|Bradley as a senator in 1913]]\nIn 1907, Republicans nominated Willson for governor, and he was elected.<ref name=klotter130 /> This victory again emboldened Republicans in the General Assembly, who nominated Bradley for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1908.<ref name=klotter130 /> The Democrats countered by nominating outgoing Governor Beckham.<ref name=kye /> Though the Democrats had a majority in the General Assembly, seven Democratic legislators refused to vote for Beckham because he favored Prohibition.<ref name=harrison282>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 282</ref> Instead, they voted for other candidates, leaving no one with a majority.<ref name=harrison282 /> As balloting continued over the course of two months with no winner, some Democrats urged Beckham to withdraw in favor of a more palatable candidate.<ref name=harrison282 /> He refused, and after twenty-nine ballots, four Democrats who favored Bradley's \"wet\" position defied allegiance to their party, electing him by a 64\u201360 margin.<ref name=klotter130 /> None of the four were re-elected to their seats in the legislature, though one eventually became Bradley's private secretary.<ref name=harrison282 />\n\nDuring the [[61st United States Congress|Sixty-first]] and [[62nd United States Congress|Sixty-second]] Congresses, Bradley was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Justice.<ref name=congbio /> He was also chairman of the Committee to Investigate Trespassers upon Indian Land during the Sixty-first Congress, and the chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims during the [[63rd United States Congress|Sixty-third Congress]].<ref name=congbio /> Historian [[James C. Klotter]] opined that during Bradley's career in the Senate, he was \"better known for his oratory than for his legislative accomplishments\".<ref name=klotter130 /> He disappointed blacks by supporting the Taft administration's policy of not appointing blacks to patronage positions in the states where they resided.<ref name=lucas92>Lucas and Wright, p. 92</ref>\n\nIn the [[1908 United States presidential election|1908 presidential election]], Bradley supported [[Charles W. Fairbanks]] for the Republican nomination, while Willson favored William Howard Taft. Disharmony marred the state nominating convention, and despite being a newly minted senator, Bradley was not chosen as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. This infuriated Bradley and ended his alliance with Willson. In the 1911 Republican nominating convention, Bradley did not support [[Edward C. O'Rear]], the party's eventual gubernatorial nominee. He did little to support O'Rear in the general election, and former governor [[James B. McCreary]] was elected.<ref>Klotter in ''Kentucky: Portrait in Paradox'', pp. 216\u2013217</ref>\n\nOn May 14, 1914, Bradley announced his intent to retire from politics upon the completion of his term, owing to the decline of his general health. Hurrying to board a [[streetcar]] following his announcement, Bradley suffered a serious fall, sustaining two broken fingers, head trauma, and internal injuries. After briefly attempting to return to his duties, he became bedfast, and died on May 23, 1914. His official cause of death was listed as [[uraemia]]. Upon Bradley's death, both houses of Congress passed resolutions expressing their sympathy, and promptly adjourned out of respect. His body was returned to Frankfort for burial, but in accordance with the wishes of Bradley and his family, did not [[Lying in state|lie in state]].

The first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to serve as governor of Kentucky, Bradley became known as the father of the Republican Party in Kentucky.<ref name=thatcherxi>Thatcher, p. xi</ref>\n\nAs a Republican in a heavily [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state, Bradley found little success early in his political career. He was defeated for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and in the United States Senate twice each. After rising to national prominence with his speech seconding the presidential nomination of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] at the [[1880 Republican National Convention]], he was nominated for governor in 1887. Although he lost the contest to [[Simon Bolivar Buckner]], he reduced the usual Democratic majority substantially. He was again nominated for governor in 1895. Capitalizing on divisions in the Democratic Party over the issue of [[free silver]], he defeated [[Parker Watkins Hardin]] in the general election. His term was marked by political struggles and violence. He was an advocate for [[African Americans|blacks]] and did much to advance their status in the state, but was unable to enact much of his reform agenda because of a hostile Democratic majority in the state legislature.\n\nRepublican [[William S. Taylor (Kentucky politician)|William S. Taylor]] was elected to succeed Bradley in the contentious [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 1899|1899 gubernatorial election]]. When Democratic nominee [[William Goebel]] and his running mate [[J. C. W. Beckham]] challenged the election results, Bradley formed part of the legal team for the Republicans. [[Taylor v. Beckham|The case]] was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], which found in favor of the Democrats. Despite being a member of the state's minority party, Bradley was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1907. Again, divisions within the Democratic Party played a role in his election. Bradley's opposition to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] made him more palatable to some Democrats than their own candidate, outgoing Governor Beckham. Beckham refused to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate, and after two months of balloting, four Democratic legislators crossed party lines and elected Bradley. Bradley had a largely undistinguished career in the Senate. On the day he announced he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, he was involved in a [[streetcar]] accident. He died from his injuries on May 23, 1914.\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam O'Connell Bradley was born near [[Lancaster, Kentucky|Lancaster]] in [[Garrard County, Kentucky]], on March 18, 1847.<ref name=congbio>\"Bradley, William O'Connell\". ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress''</ref> He was the youngest child of Robert McAfee and Nancy Ellen (Totten) Bradley.<ref name=powell>Powell, p. 72</ref> The couple also had six daughters, five of whom survived infancy, and one other son, who died as an infant.<ref name=thatchervii>Thatcher, p. vii</ref> Bradley's sister, Catherine Virginia (Bradley) Morrow, married Judge [[Thomas Z. Morrow]], who made an unsuccessful run for the governorship of Kentucky in 1883; their son, [[Edwin P. Morrow]], was elected the 40th governor of Kentucky in 1917.<ref name=thatchervii />\n\nWhile Bradley was still a child, the family moved to [[Somerset, Kentucky]], where Bradley was educated by private tutors and at a private school.<ref name=congbio /><ref name=powell /> After the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he twice dropped out of school and ran away to join the [[Union Army]], first serving as a recruiting officer in Somerset, then enlisting as a private soldier in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]].<ref name=perrin>Perrin, Battle, and Kiffin, ''Kentucky: A History of the State''</ref> Both times, his father removed him from the service because of his young age.<ref name=johnson673>E. Johnson, p. 673</ref> Despite having only this few months of service to his credit, he was referred to as \"Colonel Bradley\" by many for the rest of his life.<ref name=wiltz120>Wiltz, p. 120</ref>\n\nIn 1861, Bradley became a page in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].<ref name=thatchervii /> He studied law under his father, one of Kentucky's leading criminal defense lawyers.<ref name=powell /> Although Kentucky law required that anyone taking the [[bar examination]] be at least twenty-one years old, Bradley was allowed by a special provision of the state legislature to take it at age eighteen.<ref name=powell /> This arrangement was contingent on Bradley's being judged competent by two circuit judges.<ref name=powell /> Despite having no college education, Bradley passed the exam and was licensed in 1865, joining his father's firm in Lancaster.<ref name=congbio /><ref name=powell /> He later received an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from Kentucky University (now [[Transylvania University]]).<ref name=thatcherix>Thatcher, p. ix</ref>\n\nOn July 13, 1867,<ref>Powell and Perrin record the date as July 11</ref> Bradley married Margaret Robertson Duncan, and subsequently converted from [[Baptism]] to [[Presbyterianism]], his wife's faith. The couple had two children, George Robertson Bradley and Christine (Bradley) South.<ref>Thatcher, p. viii, xix</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nBradley's political career began in 1870, when he was elected [[county attorney|prosecuting attorney]] of Garrard County.<ref name=congbio /> A Republican in the heavily Democratic [[Kentucky's 8th congressional district|Eighth District]], Bradley was defeated by [[Milton J. Durham]] for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1872.<ref name=klotter127>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 127</ref><ref name=mcafee24>McAfee, p. 24</ref><ref name=stealey68>Stealey, p. 68</ref> In 1875, his party honored him with a nomination to serve in the U.S. Senate, even though he was too young to legally qualify for the office.<ref name=mcafee24 /> Nevertheless, he received the vote of every Republican in the state legislature.<ref name=perrin /> The following year, he again lost to Durham for a seat in the House of Representatives, but received 3,000 more votes than any Republican candidate had ever received in that district.<ref name=perrin /> He refused his party's nomination for the Senate in 1878 and 1882, and declined a nomination for [[Attorney General of Kentucky|state attorney general]] in 1879 because of ill health.<ref name=mcafee24 />\n\nBradley was unanimously chosen as a delegate-at-large to six consecutive [[Republican National Convention]]s.<ref name=johnson673 /> At the [[1880 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], he was unanimously chosen to second [[Roscoe Conkling]]'s nomination of Ulysses S. Grant for a third term as president.<ref name=mcafee24 /> His rousing oratory gained him the attention of prominent leaders of his party.<ref name=mcafee24 /> At the [[1884 Republican National Convention|1884 convention]], he was instrumental in defeating a motion to curtail [[Southern United States|Southern states']] representation.<ref name=johnson673 /> President [[Chester A. Arthur]] chose Bradley to help recover financial damages from postal officials involved in the [[Star routes|Star Route Frauds]] in 1885, but Bradley resigned this responsibility over differences with [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Benjamin H. Brewster]] regarding the prosecution of these cases.<ref name=perrin />\n\n==Gubernatorial election of 1887==\nAt their nominating convention in Louisville on May 11, 1887, Kentucky Republicans nominated Bradley for Governor of Kentucky to oppose Democrat [[Simon B. Buckner]], a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general.<ref>Tapp and Klotter, pp. 229\u2013231</ref> In his acceptance speech, Bradley implored Kentuckians to realize that the Civil War was over and to discontinue their practice of electing ex-Confederate Democrats to public office.<ref name=tapp231>Tapp and Klotter, p. 231</ref> His platform included proposals for education, implementing of a high protective tariff, and developing the state's resources.<ref name=kye>Harrison, p. 112</ref> He pointed out that, though Kentucky contained more coal than [[Pennsylvania]], the state bought half of its coal from that state.<ref name=tapp231 /> A similar situation existed with regard to lumber.<ref name=tapp231 /> He was also critical of excessive spending during the preceding Democratic administrations.<ref name=kye /> Among his cited examples of extravagance were the creation of a state bureau of agriculture and the construction of a new [[Kentucky State Penitentiary|state penitentiary]].<ref name=klotter128>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 128</ref> Democratic mismanagement of the state's affairs had resulted in able, young Kentuckians leaving the state to seek their fortunes because of a lack of opportunity at home, Bradley lamented.<ref name=tapp232>Tapp and Klotter, p. 232</ref>\n\n[[File:Governor Simon B Buckner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Simon Bolivar Buckner, Bradley's opponent in 1887|alt=A color portrait of an older gentleman with white hair and a white goatee]]\nDuring the campaign, Buckner relied on party strength and personal popularity to give him an advantage over Bradley, a decidedly superior orator. In the only debate between the two, held at [[Grayson, Kentucky|Grayson]], Bradley attacked Democrats for creating \"useless offices\" such as railroad commissioners. He defended the Republican proposal of a high protective tariff and advocated federal aid for education. When Buckner took the platform, he began by asking if Bradley had charged in an earlier speech that one of Buckner's speeches had been written by former governor [[J. Proctor Knott]]. Bradley acknowledged that he had heard that Knott had written the speech and that he (Bradley) had repeated this claim in one of his speeches. Buckner rebuked Bradley for circulating this \"infamously false\" charge, and withdrew his agreement to participate in any further joint debates. He then delivered a discourse attacking the protective tariff and federal aid for education.<ref>Tapp and Klotter, pp. 232, 234</ref>\n\nTrue to his word, Buckner never again met Bradley in a joint debate.<ref name=tapp234>Tapp and Klotter, p. 234</ref> Rumors began to circulate that Buckner was afraid to meet Bradley in debate again, and Bradley did little to dispel these rumors.<ref name=tapp234 /> The Democrats were not completely united throughout the campaign, with prominent members of the party, including Milton J. Durham and [[Kentucky Senate|State Senator]] Albert Seaton Berry, criticizing the Democratic record in the state.<ref name=tapp234 /> The Democratic ''[[Henderson Gleaner]]'' was also critical, opining \"We should be ashamed of ourselves.\"<ref name=tapp234 /> Throughout the state, Bradley hammered the issue of the blind trust afforded the perennial Democratic officeholders, specifically calling for an examination of the treasury.<ref name=tapp234 /> Though Bradley lost the election by more than 16,000 votes, he made the best showing of any Republican gubernatorial candidate to that time and garnered strong support from the state's [[African Americans|black]] voters.<ref name=klotter128 /> His concerns about the state treasury proved valid: When Buckner ordered an audit of the treasurer's books in 1888, Treasurer [[James \"Honest Dick\" Tate]] fled with $250,000 from the state treasury.<ref name=tapp242>Tapp and Klotter, p. 242</ref> He was never found.<ref name=nhok264>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 264</ref>\n\nIn 1888, Bradley's name was again put before the General Assembly as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, but he was defeated by [[James B. Beck]] by a vote of 94\u201331.<ref name=tapp245>Tapp and Klotter, p. 245</ref> Later that year, he received 103 of 832 votes for the Vice-Presidential nomination at the [[1888 Republican National Convention]], losing the nomination to [[Levi P. Morton]].<ref name=johnson233>C. Johnson, p. 233 (Powell gives the number of votes for Bradley as 105.)</ref> Upon the unsolicited recommendation of Senator Beck, President [[Benjamin Harrison]] nominated Bradley as Minister to [[Korea]] in 1889, but Bradley declined the nomination, opting to remain in Kentucky and pursue future political opportunities there.<ref name=stealey68 /> He was elected to the [[Republican National Committee]] three times between 1890 and 1896.<ref name=congbio /><ref name=johnson673 /> In 1896, he was the Kentucky delegation's choice for Presidential nominee.<ref name=powell />\n\n==Gubernatorial election of 1895==\nBradley declared his candidacy early for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895, and no real challenger emerged prior to the Republicans' nominating convention.<ref name=wiltz120 /> Consequently, Bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention.<ref name=klotter128 /> The major issue of the campaign was whether the country should maintain a monetary system based on the [[gold standard]] or allow the coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1, commonly called the [[free silver]] position.<ref name=wiltz118>Wiltz, p. 118</ref> At their convention, the Republicans adopted a platform that was unequivocally in favor of the gold standard.<ref name=wiltz125>Wiltz, p. 125</ref>\n\n[[File:Parker-Watkins-Hardin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man in his forties with black hair and a long mustache wearing a white shirt and black coat, facing right|Parker Watkins Hardin, Bradley's opponent in 1895]]\nDemocrats were divided on the monetary issue. Their eventual nominee, [[Parker Watkins Hardin]], was known to be a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President [[Grover Cleveland]] and his [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|treasury secretary]], native Kentuckian [[John G. Carlisle]], both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like [[Ollie M. James]] contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on the money question.<ref>Wiltz, pp. 118, 123\u2013124, 126</ref>\n\nThe campaign opened in Louisville on August 19, 1895. In his first address, Hardin came out squarely for free silver, ensuring the division of his party for the rest of the campaign. Bradley reprised much of his argument from the 1887 campaign against Buckner. He charged mismanagement of state government by Democrats, citing Tate's [[defalcation]] as evidence. He also stressed Hardin's association with Tate; Hardin had been the state's attorney general when Tate absconded, and the two were known to be friends. He denounced free silver and again called for a high protective tariff. He blamed Democratic President Cleveland for [[Panic of 1893|the national depression]].<ref>Wiltz, pp. 120, 127</ref>\n\nIn the third debate, held in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky|Hopkinsville]], Hardin countered Bradley's offensive against him on the money issue by charging that the election of a Republican would lead to \"Negro domination\" of the state. This put Bradley in a dilemma. If he refused to acknowledge blacks' influence on the party, he would lose their votes; if he acknowledged it, he would lose many white voters. Bradley attempted to ignore the racial question in Hopkinsville and during the next two debates, instead intensifying his criticism of Hardin on the money question and his association with Tate. In the sixth joint debate, held August 30 at [[Eminence, Kentucky|Eminence]], some members of the audience began to heckle Bradley, who was hoarse from previous debates. After attempting to restart his opening statement four times, Bradley left the platform, and the next day announced he would not participate in any further joint debates as a result of the incident. Many believed Bradley was looking for a reason to end the debates in order to dodge the racial question, and the incident at Eminence gave him the opportunity. Some black Republicans resented Bradley's attempt to dodge the racial question and encouraged fellow blacks not to support Bradley but vote for [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] [[Thomas S. Pettit]] instead.<ref>Wiltz, pp. 128, 131</ref>\n\nIn the general election, Bradley carried the vote of many [[National Democratic Party (United States)|Gold Democrats]].<ref name=klotter128 /> He also drew a number of votes from those who sympathized with the views of the [[American Protective Association]], an anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic organization.<ref name=klotter128 /> Some estimates placed the organization's membership at 14,000 in Louisville alone; it also had strength in the urban centers of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]], [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]], [[Covington, Kentucky|Covington]], and Frankfort.<ref name=wiltz129>Wiltz, p. 129</ref> Democrats were also hurt by economic factors, including the national economic problems and a severe drought in the state.<ref name=klotter129>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 129</ref> Bradley was elected the first Republican governor of Kentucky, defeating Hardin by a vote of 172,436 to 163,524.<ref name=kye /><ref name=klotter129 /> Pettit, the Populist candidate, drew 16,911 votes, most of them from Democrats in western Kentucky.<ref name=klotter129 /> Turnout in the election was 85%.<ref name=wiltz132>Wiltz, p. 132</ref> More votes than potential voters were registered in 18 counties, nine of which went for Bradley and nine for Hardin.<ref name=wiltz132 />\n\n==Governor of Kentucky==\nBradley was inaugurated December 10, 1895.<ref name=wiltz134>Wiltz, p. 134</ref> During his term, Republicans controlled the Kentucky House of Representatives, while Democrats controlled the Kentucky Senate.<ref name=kye /> This led to infighting between the two houses of the General Assembly and between the General Assembly and the governor. On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties were even with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one who supported the Democrats and another who supported the Republicans.<ref name=wiltz132 />\n\n===Legislative session of 1896===\nIn the first legislative session of Bradley's term, 75 bills were filed, including a ban on the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, a measure to make carrying a [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed weapon]] a [[felony]], and a bill banning gambling at racetracks and church fairs. Competing measures affecting [[Billiard hall|pool halls]] were introduced \u2013 one would have lifted most of the restrictions on their operation while another would have banned them altogether. Bradley added an anti-[[lynching]] law to the legislative agenda. However, none of these bills were acted on; the vast majority of the Assembly's attention during the session was focused on the election of a U.S. Senator.<ref name=reis4k>Reis, p. 4K</ref>\n\n[[File:Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man in his forties with black hair and a bushy, black mustache.

He denounced racially motivated lynchings and demanded that county officials prosecute racial violence.<ref name=lucas91 /> He called a special legislative session in March 1897 to consider an anti-lynching bill that imposed penalties including a fine of up to $500 and removal from office for any peace officer who did not prevent a lynching or mob violence.<ref name=lucas81>Lucas and Wright, p. 81</ref> It further empowered peace officers to recruit able-bodied men to help protect prisoners and fined them for failing to do so, if necessary.<ref name=lucas81 /> Despite the politically divided legislature, the bill quickly passed both houses of the General Assembly and Bradley signed it on May 11, 1897.<ref name=lucas82>Lucas and Wright, p. 82</ref> In January 1898, Bradley accepted an invitation to speak before the Anti-Mob and Lynch Law Association in [[Springfield, Ohio]].<ref name=lucas91 /> During Bradley's four-year term, twenty-five lynchings were committed in the state, down from fifty-six during the term of his predecessor.<ref name=wright179>Wright, p. 179</ref>\n\nOne high-profile case that illustrated Bradley's opposition to racial violence was that of ex-[[Slavery in the United States|slave]] George Dinning. After being emancipated, Dining saved enough money to purchase a farm in [[Simpson County, Kentucky|Simpson County]]. On January 27, 1897, a mob of 25&nbsp;armed white men came to Dinning's farm, accused him of stealing hogs and chickens, and demanded he leave the county within 10&nbsp;days. Dining denied being a thief and insisted several people in the county would vouch for his good character. The mob, enraged by Dinning's resistance, began firing on his house and wounded him twice. Dining retrieved a gun from his house and fired into the mob, killing one man. The mob fled, and the next day, Dining turned himself in to local officials. While he was in their custody, the mob returned to his farm, drove his family from their house, looted it, and razed it to the ground.<ref>Wright, pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nThe Simpson County sheriff moved Dining to [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] and eventually to Louisville to prevent him from being lynched. Governor Bradley dispatched a squad of the state militia to protect him while his trial proceeded. Despite the fact that the case involved a black man killing a white man, most observers believed Dining would be acquitted on grounds of [[self-defense]]. The jury, however, convicted Dining of [[manslaughter]] and sentenced him to seven years of [[Penal labour|hard labor]]. Immediately, Bradley's office was flooded with requests for him to intervene on Dinning's behalf. The requests came from blacks and whites, some of them ex-Confederates. Dinning's attorney, Augustus E. Willson, formally requested a [[pardon]], and Bradley issued it 10&nbsp;days after the conviction. Bradley opined that Dining had acted reasonably under the circumstances and that it was a shame that no members of the mob were charged. After being freed, Dining relocated to [[Indiana]] and hired ex-Confederate [[Bennett H. Young]] to file a federal lawsuit against some members of the mob that had identified themselves during his trial. The trial was held in Louisville, and Dining was awarded $50,000 in damages.<ref>Wright, pp. 15\u201317</ref>\n\nIn his address to the state legislature in January 1898, Bradley advocated the repeal of the state's Separate Coach Law, which provided separate streetcars for whites and blacks.<ref name=lucas91>Lucas and Wright, p. 91</ref> He appointed substantial numbers of blacks to patronage positions in government beyond the janitorial jobs they usually received.<ref name=lucas90>Lucas and Wright, p. 90</ref> He named Edward E. Underwood as the first black person on the board of trustees for Kentucky State College (later the [[University of Kentucky]]).<ref name=lucas67>Lucas and Wright, p. 67</ref> Because of his devotion to black advancement, Bradley was the only white person included in William Decker Johnson's 1897 compilation ''Biographical Sketches of Prominent Negro Men and Women of Kentucky''.<ref name=pip214>Klotter in ''Kentucky, Portrait in Paradox'', p. 214</ref>\n\n===Other matters of Bradley's term===\nThe election of Republican president [[William McKinley]] in 1896 deepened the Democrats' resolve to oppose the Republican governor and his allies.<ref name=klotter129 /> Moreover, when the legislature convened in 1898, the Democratic majority in both houses was overwhelming.<ref name=tapp366>Tapp and Klotter, p. 366</ref> Bradley's message to the General Assembly in 1898 called for numerous reforms including spending cuts to reduce government waste, putting the state's charitable institutions under control of a non-partisan board, and reforms to public education and legal system.<ref>Tapp and Klotter, pp. 368\u2013370</ref>\n\nThe legislature largely ignored the governor's message in favor of partisan concerns.<ref name=tapp370>Tapp and Klotter, p. 370</ref> A pure food and drug law was enacted without his signature.<ref name=kye /> His veto of controversial legislation regulating railroad rates, however, was sustained.<ref name=nga>\"Kentucky Governor William O. Bradley\". National Governors Association</ref> Both houses passed a resolution calling for the resignation of Senator [[William Lindsay (Kentucky politician)|William Lindsay]], a Gold Democrat who did not support [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s presidential bid, on grounds that he no longer represented the interests of his party.<ref name=tapp370 /> Lindsay responded that he represented the people of Kentucky and refused to resign his seat.<ref name=tapp370 />\n\n[[File:Old Kentucky Governor's Mansion.jpg|thumb|left|The governor's mansion was damaged by a fire during Bradley's term]]\nAnother of Bradley's concerns in his message to the legislature was the condition of the [[Old Governor's Mansion (Frankfort, Kentucky)|Governor's Mansion]]. In his address, he declared \"As to the Executive Mansion, for years its floors have been propped up to prevent them from falling, and it required more than seven hundred feet of weather strips to make it comfortable in the winter. The present site is disagreeable, the view from one side overlooks the walls of the penitentiary, and from the other the smokestack of a large flouring mill nearby.\"<ref name=clark65>Clark and Lane, p. 65</ref> Instead of addressing Bradley's concerns, the General Assembly passed a \"ripper bill\" taking control of the mansion from the governor and putting it under the supervision of the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]]. On February 10, 1899, the mansion caught fire as a result of a faulty flue in the governor's bedroom. The day was so cold that the fireman had difficulty keeping the water in their hoses unfrozen, and the mansion suffered extensive damage. Though the mansion was insured and a reporter for the ''Courier-Journal'' opined that the sensible thing to do would be to demolish the old structure and construct a new one or purchase another house in Frankfort to serve as the governor's mansion, the legislature was disinclined to make more than minimal accommodations for a Republican governor. Consequently, the mansion was once again repaired. The Bradleys stayed with a neighbor in Frankfort immediately after the fire. Thereafter, Governor Bradley stayed in Frankfort's Capitol Hotel, while Mrs. Bradley and daughter Christine returned to the family's home in Lancaster. The family re-occupied the residence prior to the end of Bradley's term.<ref>Clark and Lane, pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nBradley struggled to end violent feuds that continued in the eastern part of the state. During his term, the so-called \"Tollgate Wars\" were ongoing. In many rural areas that could not afford to build good roads, private companies had built the roads and attempted to recover the costs and turn a profit by charging tolls. Poor residents of the areas, however, maintained that the tolls were excessive, especially in light of the [[Panic of 1896|national depression]]. They began to call for \"free roads\", but their calls went unheeded by the state and national governments. Many then resorted to violence, burning toll houses and threatening and attacking toll collectors. Bradley called for harsh action against this lawlessness, but the Democratic General Assembly, sympathetic to the plight of the poor residents of the state, refused to act. By the end of Bradley's term, most of the violence had ended, as companies sold their stock to local groups or simply abandoned their roads due to the violence.<ref>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', pp. 268\u2013269</ref>\n\nKentucky's four infantry regiments and two cavalry units that served in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] were beset by poor sanitation and disease in the army camps where they were stationed. The units saw little action in the war, but 84&nbsp;men died as a result of the poor conditions. When the time came for the troops to return home, Bradley found that the state had no money to pay for the hospital trains needed for their trip. Bradley personally borrowed money from a bank to secure their passage, and trusted that the General Assembly would reimburse him.<ref name=harrison269>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 269</ref>\n\n===Goebel Election Law; gubernatorial election of 1899===\n{{Main|Kentucky gubernatorial election, 1899}}\nOn February 1, 1898, Senate President Pro Tem William Goebel sponsored a measure later referred to as the Goebel Election Law.<ref name=gel378>Kleber, \"Goebel Election Law\", p. 378</ref> The bill created a Board of Election Commissioners, appointed by the General Assembly, who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky's counties.<ref name=gel378 /> The board was empowered to examine election returns and rule on the results.<ref name=gel378 /> The power to decide the outcome of disputed elections remained with the General Assembly, pursuant to Section 153 of the [[Kentucky Constitution|state constitution]].<ref name=section153>Kentucky Constitution, Section 153</ref> Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic and Goebel was considered a likely Democratic aspirant for the governorship in the 1899 election, the bill was attacked as blatantly partisan and self-serving, even by some Democrats.<ref name=harrison270>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 270</ref> Nevertheless, Goebel was able to hold enough members of his party together to override Bradley's veto, making the bill law.<ref name=harrison270 />\n\nA proposal was made to call a special session to repeal the law, and Bradley was in favor of the action, but a poll of the legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal to justify the call. Republicans organized a [[Test case (law)|test case]] against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats \u2013 W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; [[William Thomas Ellis|W. T. Ellis]], former U. S. Representative from [[Daviess County, Kentucky|Daviess County]]; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission.<ref name=hughes7>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, pp. 7\u20138, 47</ref>\n\n[[File:William Sylvester Taylor.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A man in his late forties with black hair and a mustache. He is wearing a tightly-buttoned black coat and facing left.|William S. Taylor was the Republican nominee to succeed Bradley.]]\nAs Bradley's term drew to a close, potential Republican candidates to succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]] as a sure sign that the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law.<ref name=hughes50>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 50</ref><!--cites previous 4 sentences--> Sitting attorney general [[William S. Taylor (Kentucky politician)|William S. Taylor]] was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe.<ref name=hughes50 /><ref name=tapp425>Tapp and Klotter, p. 425</ref> Later candidates included [[Hopkins County, Kentucky|Hopkins County]] judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H.

Black leaders in the party threatened to follow Bradley and organize their own nominating convention, as they believed Taylor represented the \"lily-white\" branch of the party. Taylor attempted to hold the party together by making one of the black leaders permanent secretary of the convention and promising to appoint other black leaders to his cabinet if elected. He also tried to bring Bradley back to the convention by promising to nominate Bradley's nephew, Edwin P. Morrow, for secretary of state. Bradley refused the offer.<ref name=tapp425 /><!--cites previous 5 sentences--> In the face of Taylor's superior organization, all the other candidates withdrew in a show of party unity, allowing Taylor to be nominated unanimously.<ref name=hughes53>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 53</ref>\n\nBradley had initially been cool toward Taylor, but he agreed to tour the state with Republican leader Augustus E. Willson after Goebel, the eventual Democratic nominee, made a similar tour with William Jennings Bryan, who was wildly popular in the state. Although he insisted he only wanted to defend his administration from Democratic attacks, Henry Watterson suggested that Bradley was seeking to enlist Taylor's support for his anticipated senatorial bid. Bradley began his tour of the state in Louisville, charging that Democrats had to import an orator for their candidate because all of the state's best men had deserted him. He also encouraged blacks not to desert the Republican Party. He contrasted his appointments of blacks to his cabinet with the Democrats' support of the Separate Coach Bill. Throughout his speech, Bradley defended his administration and never once mentioned Taylor. Finally, he closed with the line \"And go to the polls and elect Taylor!\"<ref name=tapp439>Tapp and Klotter, p. 439</ref> As Bradley exited the stage, Willson whispered to him, \"Bradley, that's the slickest thing you ever did in your life.\"<ref name=tapp439 /> As they continued to tour the state, Bradley and Willson often drew crowds larger than those assembled for Taylor.<ref>Tapp and Klotter, pp. 437, 439</ref>\n\nAs the campaign drew to a close, both Republicans and Democrats warned of the possibility that [[electoral fraud]] and violence would be perpetrated by the other side. Louisville mayor [[Charles P. Weaver]], a Goebel Democrat, added 500 men to the city's police force just before the election, leading to charges that voter intimidation would occur in that city. Bradley countered by ordering the state militia to be ready to quell any disturbances across the state. On election day, the headline of the ''Courier-Journal'' proclaimed \"[[Bayonet]] Rule\".<ref>Tapp and Klotter, pp. 439\u2013440</ref>\n\nFor all the claims about the potential for violence, election day, November 7, remained mostly calm across the state.<ref name=tapp440>Tapp and Klotter, p. 440</ref> Fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide.<ref name=tapp440 /> Voting returns were slow, and on election night, the race was still too close to call.<ref name=harrison270 /> When the official tally was announced, Taylor had won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331.<ref name=harrison270 /> Former governor John Y. Brown, nominated by a dissident group of Democrats, had garnered 12,040 votes, and Populist candidate John G. Blair had captured 2,936.<ref name=harrison270 /> Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2\u20131 decision to certify the election results.<ref name=ga377>Klotter, \"Goebel Assassination\", p. 377</ref> The board's majority opinion claimed that they did not have any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses, leaving them without grounds to invalidate any votes.<ref name=tapp444>Tapp, p. 444</ref> Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899.<ref name=ga377 />\n\nFollowing his term as governor, Bradley moved to Louisville and resumed his legal practice. Shortly after Bradley left office, Goebel and his running mate, J. C. W. Beckham, challenged the results of the 1899 election in the General Assembly, per the state constitution.<ref name=hughes167>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 167</ref> All the candidates for the state's minor offices contested as well. Bradley and his colleague Augustus Willson formed part of the legal team that represented the Republicans before the General Assembly and in court, where they challenged the legality of the Goebel Election Law and, later, the actions of the General Assembly's contest committee.<ref name=hughes277>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 277</ref>\n\nRepublicans around the state expected the General Assembly's contest committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital, awaiting the contest committee's findings. On the morning of January 30, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, a shot rang out, and Goebel fell wounded. He was taken to a nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. As expected, the contest committee recommended invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor, and the General Assembly voted to certify the recommendation. Goebel was sworn in as governor, but he died on February 3. Beckham then took the oath of office and continued the legal challenge against Taylor and his lieutenant governor, [[John Marshall (Kentucky)|John Marshall]].<ref>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', pp. 271\u2013272</ref>\n\nIn federal court, Bradley argued on behalf of the Republican minor officers that the Goebel Election Law deprived citizens of their [[suffrage|right to vote]]. The right to vote, he claimed, was inherent in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s guarantee of \"liberty\", and could not be taken from any citizen without [[due process]].<ref>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, pp. 277\u2013278</ref> Federal judge [[William Howard Taft]] ruled that the Republicans would have to seek remedy in the state courts.<ref name=hughes282>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, p. 282</ref> After a protracted legal battle, all of the minor officers were unseated except Attorney General Clifton J. Pratt.<ref name=tapp505>Tapp, p. 505</ref>\n\nThe cases of Taylor and Marshall were appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In the case of ''[[Taylor v. Beckham]]'', Bradley countered Democrats' claims that the federal courts should not have jurisdiction by citing ''[[Boyd v. State of Nebraska Thayer|Thayer v. Boyd]]'', a similar case in which the court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the General Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly on the grounds that it had left some members as judges of their own cases, Bradley argued. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including giving insufficient time for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. The court refused to intervene in the case, however, because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian [[John Marshall Harlan]].<ref>Hughes, Schaefer, and Williams, pp. 327\u2013328</ref>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn a joint ballot of the General Assembly in 1900, Bradley was defeated for a seat in the U.S. Senate by a vote of 75\u201354.<ref name=klotter130>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 130</ref> After the unseating of Taylor, the state Republican party split into factions, with Godfrey Hunter at the head of one and Bradley at the head of the other.<ref name=pip204>Klotter in ''Kentucky: Portrait in Paradox'', p. 204</ref> The two factions formed a tentative alliance to nominate [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]] law professor John W. Yerkes in the special election called after Goebel's assassination, but Yerkes lost to Democratic nominee J. C. W. Beckham.<ref name=pip204 /> At the [[1904 Republican National Convention]], Bradley was chosen to second the nomination of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for president.<ref name=powell />\n\nFactionalism again marked the Republican nominating convention in 1904. Bradley and his faction backed Augustus E. Willson for governor, while Hunter and Yerkes favored Louisville businessman [[Morris B. Belknap]], the son-in-law of former governor Simon Buckner. When convention officials ruled against a county delegation committed to Willson, he withdrew from the contest. Bradley was angered as Belknap was nominated on the first ballot and subsequently lost to J. C. W. Beckham, who was allowed to seek a second term because a court ruled he had not been elected to a full term in 1900.<ref name=pip206>Klotter in ''Kentucky: Portrait in Paradox'', p. 206</ref>\n\n===Career in the Senate===\n[[File:WilliamO'ConnellBradley.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A man in his mid-sixties, wearing a white suit and hat with a black bow tie, walking in front of a building|Bradley as a senator in 1913]]\nIn 1907, Republicans nominated Willson for governor, and he was elected.<ref name=klotter130 /> This victory again emboldened Republicans in the General Assembly, who nominated Bradley for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1908.<ref name=klotter130 /> The Democrats countered by nominating outgoing Governor Beckham.<ref name=kye /> Though the Democrats had a majority in the General Assembly, seven Democratic legislators refused to vote for Beckham because he favored Prohibition.<ref name=harrison282>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 282</ref> Instead, they voted for other candidates, leaving no one with a majority.<ref name=harrison282 /> As balloting continued over the course of two months with no winner, some Democrats urged Beckham to withdraw in favor of a more palatable candidate.<ref name=harrison282 /> He refused, and after twenty-nine ballots, four Democrats who favored Bradley's \"wet\" position defied allegiance to their party, electing him by a 64\u201360 margin.<ref name=klotter130 /> None of the four were re-elected to their seats in the legislature, though one eventually became Bradley's private secretary.<ref name=harrison282 />\n\nDuring the [[61st United States Congress|Sixty-first]] and [[62nd United States Congress|Sixty-second]] Congresses, Bradley was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Justice.<ref name=congbio /> He was also chairman of the Committee to Investigate Trespassers upon Indian Land during the Sixty-first Congress, and the chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims during the [[63rd United States Congress|Sixty-third Congress]].<ref name=congbio /> Historian [[James C. Klotter]] opined that during Bradley's career in the Senate, he was \"better known for his oratory than for his legislative accomplishments\".<ref name=klotter130 /> He disappointed blacks by supporting the Taft administration's policy of not appointing blacks to patronage positions in the states where they resided.<ref name=lucas92>Lucas and Wright, p. 92</ref>\n\nIn the [[1908 United States presidential election|1908 presidential election]], Bradley supported [[Charles W. Fairbanks]] for the Republican nomination, while Willson favored William Howard Taft. Disharmony marred the state nominating convention, and despite being a newly minted senator, Bradley was not chosen as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. This infuriated Bradley and ended his alliance with Willson. In the 1911 Republican nominating convention, Bradley did not support [[Edward C. O'Rear]], the party's eventual gubernatorial nominee. He did little to support O'Rear in the general election, and former governor [[James B. McCreary]] was elected.<ref>Klotter in ''Kentucky: Portrait in Paradox'', pp. 216\u2013217</ref>\n\nOn May 14, 1914, Bradley announced his intent to retire from politics upon the completion of his term, owing to the decline of his general health. Hurrying to board a [[streetcar]] following his announcement, Bradley suffered a serious fall, sustaining two broken fingers, head trauma, and internal injuries. After briefly attempting to return to his duties, he became bedfast, and died on May 23, 1914. His official cause of death was listed as [[uraemia]]. Upon Bradley's death, both houses of Congress passed resolutions expressing their sympathy, and promptly adjourned out of respect. His body was returned to Frankfort for burial, but in accordance with the wishes of Bradley and his family, did not [[Lying in state|lie in state]].

The two decide to remain at the store until the storm passes. Bobin\u00f4t then decides to buy a can of shrimp for his wife, Calixta, while he waits with his son for the storm to abate.\n\nMeanwhile, back at their house, Bobin\u00f4t's wife Calixta is so occupied with her sewing that at first she does not notice the incoming storm. Finally, she notices that it is growing darker outside, so she decides to shut the windows and retrieve Bobin\u00f4t's and Bibi's clothes, which are hanging outside. As she goes outside to retrieve the clothes, she notices Alc\u00e9e, one of her former beaus who has ridden up to the house in the hopes of riding out the storm with her.\n\nAs the storm worsens, Alc\u00e9e asks Calixta if he can come in until the storm is over; Calixta obliges. Alc\u00e9e then helps Calixta get some clothes off the line. He is reluctant to come in and stays outside until it becomes apparent that the storm is not going to let up. Calixta gathers up the lengths of cotton sheet she had been sewing while Alc\u00e9e takes a seat in the rocker. Calixta goes over to the window and observes the intensity of the storm, which disturbs her so much she nearly falls. Alc\u00e9e then attempts to comfort her and in doing so, is reminded of the passion they once felt for each other. Alc\u00e9e reminds Calixta of their time at \"Assumption,\" and she immediately remembers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/storm-kate-chopin|title=The Storm Summary|website=E Notes}}</ref> At first, Calixta is standoffish when Alc\u00e9e tries to comfort her, but she can't resist him as she also becomes overwhelmed with passion. As the storm increases in intensity, so does the passion of the two former lovers. The sexual encounter between the pair ends at the same time as the storm. Alc\u00e9e and Calixta go their separate ways once more, and they are both happy in their current marriages because they got the closure they needed from the past one.\n\nBobin\u00f4t and Bibi return from the grocery store, and Calixta immediately embraces them. However, they are expecting a more intimidating approach from Calixta, considering how dirty Bibi is from their journey home. Bobin\u00f4t presents his gift of the can of shrimp to his wife, and she remarks that they will feast that night. Meanwhile, Alc\u00e9e writes a loving letter to his wife, Clarisse, encouraging her to stay in Biloxi with their children as long as she needs. He notes that their well-being is more important than the anxiety from separation that he endures. Clarisse is \"charmed\" by the letter and is happy in Biloxi because she feels free, as if she were a maiden again. She explains how although she is \"devoted\" to her husband, she isn't in a rush to go back to her married life.

The story gives the impression that before the storm, Calixta was lacking excitement from her marriage, but after the passionate re connection with Alc\u00e9e, everything is better than before in spite of her adulterous acts.\n\n== Symbolism ==\n\"The Storm\" is a short story that takes place during the 19th century. Chopin's protagonist Calixta is portrayed as the typical housewife, as she is sewing and tending to Bobin\u00f4t and Bibi's clothes. Throughout the story there are many symbolic references. While many claim that the antagonist of the story is the storm itself, it is widely accepted that the storm symbolizes the passion and affair between Calixta and Alc\u00e9e. As soon as Calixta goes outside to get Bibi and Bobin\u00f4t's clothes off the line and the storm approaches, so does Alc\u00e9e seeking shelter from the storm.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://sittingbee.com/the-storm-kate-chopin/|title=The Storm by Kate Chopin|last=McManus|first=Dermot|date=2015-04-11|work=The Sitting Bee|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}</ref> The end of the storm specifically leaves the status of the affair between Calixta and Alc\u00e9e open-ended as Alc\u00e9e takes an extended stay absence from his wife to be in closer proximity to Calixta after the events of the night. At the end of the storm, the narrators says: \"the storm passed and everyone was happy.\" They both experience an intense passion that their relationships were missing.\n\nAnother symbolic reference is Assumption, the town in which Calixta and Alcee kissed. Symbolically, Assumption has a religious connotation referring to [[Assumption of Mary|Virgin Mary]]. The article, ''Romantic Love and Morality in \"The Storm\"'' states'','' \"the place's name itself, 'Assumption', prevented [Calixta] from engaging in sexual intercourse because it is based off of the Assumption of Mary, which is Virgin Mary's climb to heaven after her death.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://literatureessaysamples.com/romantic-love-and-morality-in-the-storm/|title=Romantic Love and Morality in \u201cThe Storm\u201d \u2013 Literature Essay Samples|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Assumption was not an idealistic place for Calixta and Alcee to have sex because she was still a virgin.

As Alcee gazes into Calixta's eyes, they are reminded of the unaccomplished desires they had before and believed that their affair was not sinful in their eyes. \n\nWhite is also used throughout the story to describe Calixta's skin and her bed, symbolizing both innocence and purity. Although Calixta is described as innocent throughout the story, she and Alc\u00e9e still have a sexual encounter. Calixta's body \"know[s] for the first time its birthright,\" meaning that even though she is married and has a child, she is obviously not innocent but she is now aware of the pleasure that her body can achieve with a different man.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/storm-chopin/sex-quotes-2.html|title=The Storm Sex Quotes Page 2|website=www.shmoop.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}} Also, the bed, which is shown to be white, symbolizes Calixta's innocence as the place where she expresses her passion.<ref name=\":1\" /> By stating how \"the storm passed and everyone was happy\"<ref name=\":1\" /> at the end of the story, it signifies how the affair is not viewed as negative.

Jake made much of the music in the earlier \"The Key of Awesome\" music videos.

One of the most recognizable pieces of his music is \"Moon Men\", which is used in the original Vsauce channel and is often played whenever Stevens poses a mysterious question or makes a mysterious statement. Other pieces of music used by the channels include \"145-(Poodles)\", \"Sunday\", \"It's Good to be D\", \"Hydrogen\", \"Darwin\", \"Carlin Dream\", \"Lions Tigers and Apes Part II\", \"Hanami\", \"Pressed Pennies\", \"Keith\" and \"Shona\". They are often played when the audience is encouraged to think. \"Turquoise\" is often used, usually when big, astonishing, or otherwise significant facts or ideas are mentioned. \"Flan\" is often used for sad or abstract facts. \"Rainstorms and Rainbows (I Am the Hero)\", \"Going Down\", and \"Flan\" are played at the end of videos. \"192-1\", \"White\", \"For You\", \"Meet Men and Party (All Night)\", \"Banana\", \"Ducking\", \"Buildings and Bikes\", \"Shallow Anne\", \"Button\", \"Olive\", and \"Muff Mittens\" are also often used in Vsauce2 and Vsauce3.\n\nIn the video \"The Moon Terminator Illusion\", Chudnow's vinyl album ''Shona EP'' was the focus object against the wall when showing the visual effects of zooming and moving on nearby objects (a Vsauce mug) and distant ones (the EP).\n\n== Notable collaborations and other appearances ==\nVsauce has collaborated with Henry Reich of [[MinutePhysics]] on two videos: \"Guns in Space\"<ref name=Gizmodo2/> and \"What if the Earth were Hollow?\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Shaw|url=http://www.itworld.com/virtualization/291747/science-monday-minutephysics-teams-vsauce-what-if-palooza|title=Science Monday: MinutePhysics teams with VSauce for a What-if-a-palooza|work=IT World|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Vsauce has also collaborated with [[The Periodic Table of Videos|Periodic Videos]]<ref>\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/feature_vsauce_visit.htm|title=Vsauce Visit \u2013 The Periodic Table of Videos|work=Periodic Videos|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfCp7CPx-M|title=Standard Weight (feat.

They are often played when the audience is encouraged to think. \"Turquoise\" is often used, usually when big, astonishing, or otherwise significant facts or ideas are mentioned. \"Flan\" is often used for sad or abstract facts. \"Rainstorms and Rainbows (I Am the Hero)\", \"Going Down\", and \"Flan\" are played at the end of videos. \"192-1\", \"White\", \"For You\", \"Meet Men and Party (All Night)\", \"Banana\", \"Ducking\", \"Buildings and Bikes\", \"Shallow Anne\", \"Button\", \"Olive\", and \"Muff Mittens\" are also often used in Vsauce2 and Vsauce3.\n\nIn the video \"The Moon Terminator Illusion\", Chudnow's vinyl album ''Shona EP'' was the focus object against the wall when showing the visual effects of zooming and moving on nearby objects (a Vsauce mug) and distant ones (the EP).\n\n== Notable collaborations and other appearances ==\nVsauce has collaborated with Henry Reich of [[MinutePhysics]] on two videos: \"Guns in Space\"<ref name=Gizmodo2/> and \"What if the Earth were Hollow?\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Shaw|url=http://www.itworld.com/virtualization/291747/science-monday-minutephysics-teams-vsauce-what-if-palooza|title=Science Monday: MinutePhysics teams with VSauce for a What-if-a-palooza|work=IT World|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Vsauce has also collaborated with [[The Periodic Table of Videos|Periodic Videos]]<ref>\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/feature_vsauce_visit.htm|title=Vsauce Visit \u2013 The Periodic Table of Videos|work=Periodic Videos|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfCp7CPx-M|title=Standard Weight (feat.

Cassils left in 2000 to attend [[California Institute of the Arts]] on a merit scholarship; they received an MFA in 2002. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bemiscenter.org/monumentpush/about-the-artist.html|title=Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts : Monument Push : About the Artist|website=www.bemiscenter.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n\n==Collaborative practice with the Toxic Titties==\nAt CalArts, Cassils, Clover Leary, and Julia Steinmetz co-founded the [[Toxic Titties]], a performance collective that was active for nearly a decade.<ref name=\"nscad\">{{cite web | url=http://nscad.ca/en/home/abouttheuniversity/news/fallclassnotes.aspx | title=Class Notes | publisher=Nova Scotia College of Art and Design | accessdate=7 September 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918011759/http://nscad.ca/en/home/abouttheuniversity/news/fallclassnotes.aspx | archive-date=18 September 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Toxic Titties performed and exhibited nationally at such locations as: the Advocate Gallery (2000), Track 16 Gallery (2002), at the California Institute of the Arts (2001\u201302), Michael Dawson Gallery (2002), LA FreeWaves Festival (2002),<ref>{{cite web|title = Artists|url = http://freewaves.org/past-festivals/2002/artists/toxictitties.htm|website = freewaves.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> Intersectional Feminisms conference at UC Riverside in Los Angeles (2002), [[REDCAT|REDCAT at the Walt Disney Concert Hall]] (2003), Center on Contemporary Art, Seattle<ref>{{cite web|title = neoqueer at CoCA|url = http://cocaseattle.org/Shows/neoqueer/neoqueer_seattletime_potterf.htm|website = cocaseattle.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112740/http://cocaseattle.org/Shows/neoqueer/neoqueer_seattletime_potterf.htm|archive-date = 2016-03-04|url-status = dead}}</ref> (2005), USC Center for Feminist Research, Los Angeles (2006), Art in General (2006), Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions,<ref>{{cite web|title = Draw a Line and Follow It|url = http://welcometolace.org/lace/draw-a-line-and-follow-it/|website = welcometolace.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> Los Angeles (2008) and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (YBCA)<ref>{{cite web|title = Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (YBCA) Exhibition {{!}} Art Knowledge News|url = http://artknowledgenews.com/200801144480/Yerba_Buena_Centerfor_the_Arts_YBCA.html|website = artknowledgenews.com|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> San Francisco, CA (2009).\n\nInternationally Toxic Titties exhibited at Manifesta in Frankfurt, Germany (2000), Schnitt Ausstellungsraum in Cologne, Germany (2000), Outside Field: International Festival, Ex-Teresa Arte Actual, Mexico City (2003) and MUCA Roma, Mexico City (2003). In collaboration with artist [[Dorit Margrieter]], they created the 16mm film ''10104 Angelo View Drive'', a work set in John Lautner's modernist [[Sheats\u2013Goldstein Residence|Sheats-Goldstein Residence]] in Beverly Hills exploring the relationship between architecture and desire.

Having infiltrated the behind the scenes process of Beecroft's practice, they launched a parasitical performance, ''[http://cassils.net/portfolio/beecroft-intervention/ Beecroft Intervention]'' (2001). Undermining power structures of identity, class, feminism and art commerce, Toxic Titties hijacked Beecroft's piece by engaging the female performers, who had been homogenized and objectified, in critical dialogue. Their influence unionized the group and forced an increase in the cost of their labor. They documented this performance through the essay ''Behind Enemy Lines: Toxic Titties Infiltrate Vanessa Beecroft'' published in [[Signs (journal)|''Signs: Journal of Women and Culture in Society'']] (2006), and reprinted in [[Art Metropole|''Art Metropole'']]'s ''Commerce By Artists''<ref>{{cite web|title = Art Metropole / Commerce By Artists|url = http://artmetropole.com/shop/4823|website = Art Metropole|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> (2011).\n\n==Emerging solo career==\nIn 2007, Cassils was awarded a merit scholarship to participate in a residency program at the [[Banff Centre|Banff Centre for the Arts]] and a Creation Grant from the Canada Council of the Arts Intra Arts department, which allowed them to create an experimental documentary and performance titled ''Simulation In Training''. This piece investigated the theater of war present in the American mass media, and demonstrated the overlap between [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and the [[military\u2013industrial complex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cargocollective.com/Cassils/following/Cassils/SIMULATION-IN-TRAINING-2007#.Xl1tc6hKg2w|title=Simulation in Training / 2007|author=Cassils|publisher=Cargo Collective|accessdate=March 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Cassils won the [[Franklin Furnace Archive|Franklin Furnace]] Performance Art Fund<ref>{{cite web|title = FF Fund|url = http://franklinfurnace.org/artists/funded_projects/the_franklin_furnace_fund/index.php|website = franklinfurnace.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> for the performance ''Hard Times'', their first piece integrating these aesthetic, physical and political concerns. The resulting film was subsequently screened at the Asian Experimental Video Festival in Hong Kong, China, Festival Cin\u00e9 \u00e0 Dos in Koulikoro, Mali, at Art Cinema Zawya in Cairo, Egypt. and Cultureel tetras de Kaaij, Nijmegen in the Netherlands.\n\nNext Cassils created the performance ''Tiresias'', a five-hour durational performance for an exhibition at [[Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions]] called ''Gutted''<ref>{{cite web|title = Upcoming Events GUTTED: LACE's Annual Winter Benefit|url = http://welcometolace.org/event/gutted-laces-annual-winter-benefit/|website = welcometolace.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> (2010). During the live performance they used their body heat to melt a neoclassical Greek male torso carved out of ice, recasting the myth of Tiresias as a story of endurance and transformation. Cassils has performed ''Tiresias'' at the ANTI International Contemporary Art Festival in Kuopio Finland (2012); at the FADO Performance Art Center<ref>{{cite web|title = FADO Performance Art Centre|url = http://www.performanceart.ca/index.php?m=gallery&id=177|website = www.performanceart.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> in Toronto, Canada; at the City Of Women Festival in conjunction with The Kapelica Gallery<ref>{{cite web|title = # Galerija Kapelica|url = http://www.kapelica.org/index_en.html#event=814|website = www.kapelica.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> in Ljubljana Slovenia; at the Performatorium Festival of Queer Performance,<ref>{{cite web|title = Queer City Cinema|url = http://www.queercitycinema.ca/performance2012/?s=performance2012|website = www.queercitycinema.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> Regina, Canada (2013); and at Performance Studies International<ref>{{cite web|title = Performance Studies International Conference comes to Stanford University, June 26\u201330 {{!}} Stanford Arts|url = http://arts.stanford.edu/performance-studies-international-conference-comes-to-stanford-university-june-26-30/|website = arts.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> at [[Stanford University]] (2013). Most recently the piece was installed at the National Gallery of Art in Sopot, Poland (2015). Articles about ''Tiresias'' have appeared in well respected academic journals, including an essay in ''[[TDR (journal)|The Drama Review]]'' by Maurya Wickstrom,<ref>{{cite journal|title = Desire and Kairos: Cassils's Terisias|journal = TDR/The Drama Review|volume = 58|pages = 46\u201355|url = https://www.academia.edu/10281646|accessdate = 2015-09-27|last1 = Wickstrom|first1 = Maurya}}</ref> and another in ''Performance Research Journal'' by Megan Hoetger.<ref>{{cite web|title = Past Issues - Performance Research Volume19, Issue3 - CPR|url = http://www.performance-research.org/past-issue-detail.php?issue_id=77|website = www.performance-research.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> Both journals featured images from the performance on their cover (2014).\n\n==Mid-career achievements==\nIn 2010, Cassils was awarded a Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Artist Research Grant as part of LACE's contribution to [[Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A., 1945-1980|Pacific Standard Time]], an initiative of the Getty with arts institutions across Southern California, showcasing cultural production from 1945-1980. LACE chose Cassils to make a new performance for their exhibition ''Los Angeles Goes Live: Exploring a Social History of Performance Art in Southern California (LAGA)''<ref>{{cite web|title = Los Angeles Goes Live: Performance Art in Southern California 1970-1983|url = http://welcometolace.org/lace/los-angeles-goes-live-performance-art-in-southern-california-1970-1983/|website = welcometolace.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> in which they were invited to use LACE's archive as a springboard from which to create a new work. Cassils created ''Cuts: A Traditional Sculpture'', a large body of work that began with a six-month durational performance and generated video installations, photographs, watercolors, and a magazine. This performance is a reinterpretation of Eleanor Antin's 1972 performance ''Carving: A Traditional Sculpture'', in which Antin crash dieted for 45 days and documented her body daily with photographs from four vantage points. Instead Cassils used their mastery of [[bodybuilding]] and nutrition to gain 23 pounds of muscle over 23 weeks, transforming their physique into a traditionally masculine muscular form. Elements from ''CUTS'' have been exhibited at Rutgers University,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://iwa.rutgers.edu/media/uploads/TransTechnology_ExhibitionCatalogue.pdf|title = Trans Technology Exhibition Catalogue|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140430211110/http://iwa.rutgers.edu/media/uploads/TransTechnology_ExhibitionCatalogue.pdf|archive-date = 2014-04-30|url-status = dead}}</ref> the Stamp Gallery at the University of Maryland,<ref>{{cite web|title = Queer Objectivity|url = http://thestamp.umd.edu/stamp_gallery/past_exhibitions/queer_objectivity|website = thestamp.umd.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art (2013),<ref>{{cite web|title = Battleground States {{!}} UMOCA|url = http://www.utahmoca.org/past/battleground-states/|website = www.utahmoca.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> as well as at SOMArts <ref>{{cite web|title = Projected Personae \u2014 SOMArts|url = http://www.somarts.org/personae/|website = www.somarts.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150910193206/http://www.somarts.org/personae/|archive-date = 2015-09-10|url-status = dead}}</ref> San Francisco, and MU Art Space,<ref>{{cite web|title = GenderBlender {{!}} past {{!}} MU Eindhoven|url = http://www.mu.nl/uk/exhibitions/past/genderblender/|website = www.mu.nl|accessdate = 2015-09-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150928210430/http://www.mu.nl/uk/exhibitions/past/genderblender/|archive-date = 2015-09-28|url-status = dead}}</ref> Eindhoven, the Netherlands (2014).\n\nCassils also collaborated with photographer and makeup artist Robin Black to create ''Advertisement: Homage to Benglis'', in which Cassils staged a series of self-empowered representations of trans embodiment, substituting a ripped masculine physique for Benglis's double-ended phallus.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bend It Like Benglis|url = http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/bend-it-like-benglis/|accessdate = 2015-09-28|date = 2014-10-20}}</ref> This piece received critical acclaim and became the subject articles in the ''LA Weekly'' (2011),<ref>{{cite web|title = Heather Cassils Gets Ripped for LACE Performance Art Show|url = http://www.laweekly.com/arts/heather-cassils-gets-ripped-for-lace-performance-art-show-2172171|accessdate = 2015-09-27|first = Catherine|last = Wagley|date = 2011-09-29}}</ref> and ''X-Tra Contemporary Art Quarterly'' (2012).<ref>{{cite web|title = Re-performance: History as an Experience to Be Had|url = http://x-traonline.org/article/re-performance-history-as-an-experience-to-be-had/|website = x-traonline.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> It is a key subject of Lianne McTavish's book ''Feminist Figure Girl Look Hot While You Fight The Patriarchy'' (2015),<ref>{{cite web|title = Feminist Figure Girl|url = http://www.sunypress.edu/p-5981-feminist-figure-girl.aspx|website = www.sunypress.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> and was featured in the publication ''Art and Queer Culture'' by Richard Meyer and Catherine Lord (2013).<ref>{{cite web|title = Art and Queer Culture {{!}} Art {{!}} Phaidon Store|url = http://www.phaidon.com/store/art/art-and-queer-culture-9780714849355/|website = Phaidon|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> ''Advertisement: Homage to Benglis'' was featured in Cassils's solo exhibition at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, BODY OF WORK, and it is currently on view and being used as the key art for an exhibition in Berlin at the Schwules Museum* and Deutsches Historisches Museum called Homosexualities (2015).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Deutsches Historisches Museum: Homosexualit\u00e4t_en|url = https://www.dhm.de/ausstellungen/homosexualitaet-en.html|website = www.dhm.de|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}</ref> The film ''Fast Twitch// Slow Twitch'', also part of the CUTS series, was screened at Moving Image Fair,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fast Twitch// Slow Twitch|url = https://www.artsy.net/article/moving-image-london-2013-heather-cassils-fast-twitch-slash-slash-slow-twitch|accessdate = 2015-09-28|date = 2013-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title = Artist -

NSCAD's unconventional curriculum (where figure drawing classes included nude models jumping on a trampoline) and its faculty (in particular [[Jan Peacock]] and [[Garry Kennedy|Garry Neil Kennedy]]) influenced their early political and feminist work in video and performance.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nUpon graduating from NSCAD in 1997, Cassils moved to New York City in 1997, interning at the [[Franklin Furnace Archive|Franklin Furnace]] assisting [[Martha Wilson]] with the digitization of the archive. In this context they created early exhibitions and performances at the Holland Tunnel Gallery (1998), the Limelight, and PS122.

In collaboration with artist [[Dorit Margrieter]], they created the 16mm film ''10104 Angelo View Drive'', a work set in John Lautner's modernist [[Sheats\u2013Goldstein Residence|Sheats-Goldstein Residence]] in Beverly Hills exploring the relationship between architecture and desire. This project was featured in solo exhibitions at [[Art Basel Miami Beach]] and at [[Mumok|MUMOK]], the Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien, Vienna, Austria (2006) as well as at Trinity Square Video in Toronto, Canada (2008).\n\nThe Toxic Titties' work received critical attention from significant scholars such as [[Amelia Jones]],<ref>{{Cite book|title = Live Art In LA: Performance in Southern California|last = Jones|first = Amelia|publisher = Routlage|year = 2012|isbn = 9780415684231|location = |page = 184}}</ref> [[Jennifer Doyle]],<ref>{{cite book|title = Sex Objects|url = http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/sex-objects|website = University of Minnesota Press|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> [[Christine Ross]],<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Aesthetics of Disengagement (Contemporary Art and Depression)|last = Ross|first = Christine|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 2005|isbn = 9780816645398|location = |pages = |url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/aestheticsofdise0000ross}}</ref> and [[Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Many of these scholars first encountered the work of the Toxic Titties when Cassils and Leary were hired to perform in [[Vanessa Beecroft]]'s VB46 at the [[Gagosian Gallery]] in Beverly Hills. Having infiltrated the behind the scenes process of Beecroft's practice, they launched a parasitical performance, ''[http://cassils.net/portfolio/beecroft-intervention/ Beecroft Intervention]'' (2001). Undermining power structures of identity, class, feminism and art commerce, Toxic Titties hijacked Beecroft's piece by engaging the female performers, who had been homogenized and objectified, in critical dialogue. Their influence unionized the group and forced an increase in the cost of their labor. They documented this performance through the essay ''Behind Enemy Lines: Toxic Titties Infiltrate Vanessa Beecroft'' published in [[Signs (journal)|''Signs: Journal of Women and Culture in Society'']] (2006), and reprinted in [[Art Metropole|''Art Metropole'']]'s ''Commerce By Artists''<ref>{{cite web|title = Art Metropole / Commerce By Artists|url = http://artmetropole.com/shop/4823|website = Art Metropole|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> (2011).\n\n==Emerging solo career==\nIn 2007, Cassils was awarded a merit scholarship to participate in a residency program at the [[Banff Centre|Banff Centre for the Arts]] and a Creation Grant from the Canada Council of the Arts Intra Arts department, which allowed them to create an experimental documentary and performance titled ''Simulation In Training''. This piece investigated the theater of war present in the American mass media, and demonstrated the overlap between [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and the [[military\u2013industrial complex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cargocollective.com/Cassils/following/Cassils/SIMULATION-IN-TRAINING-2007#.Xl1tc6hKg2w|title=Simulation in Training / 2007|author=Cassils|publisher=Cargo Collective|accessdate=March 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Cassils won the [[Franklin Furnace Archive|Franklin Furnace]] Performance Art Fund<ref>{{cite web|title = FF Fund|url = http://franklinfurnace.org/artists/funded_projects/the_franklin_furnace_fund/index.php|website = franklinfurnace.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> for the performance ''Hard Times'', their first piece integrating these aesthetic, physical and political concerns. The resulting film was subsequently screened at the Asian Experimental Video Festival in Hong Kong, China, Festival Cin\u00e9 \u00e0 Dos in Koulikoro, Mali, at Art Cinema Zawya in Cairo, Egypt. and Cultureel tetras de Kaaij, Nijmegen in the Netherlands.\n\nNext Cassils created the performance ''Tiresias'', a five-hour durational performance for an exhibition at [[Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions]] called ''Gutted''<ref>{{cite web|title = Upcoming Events GUTTED: LACE's Annual Winter Benefit|url = http://welcometolace.org/event/gutted-laces-annual-winter-benefit/|website = welcometolace.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> (2010). During the live performance they used their body heat to melt a neoclassical Greek male torso carved out of ice, recasting the myth of Tiresias as a story of endurance and transformation. Cassils has performed ''Tiresias'' at the ANTI International Contemporary Art Festival in Kuopio Finland (2012); at the FADO Performance Art Center<ref>{{cite web|title = FADO Performance Art Centre|url = http://www.performanceart.ca/index.php?m=gallery&id=177|website = www.performanceart.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> in Toronto, Canada; at the City Of Women Festival in conjunction with The Kapelica Gallery<ref>{{cite web|title = # Galerija Kapelica|url = http://www.kapelica.org/index_en.html#event=814|website = www.kapelica.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> in Ljubljana Slovenia; at the Performatorium Festival of Queer Performance,<ref>{{cite web|title = Queer City Cinema|url = http://www.queercitycinema.ca/performance2012/?s=performance2012|website = www.queercitycinema.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> Regina, Canada (2013); and at Performance Studies International<ref>{{cite web|title = Performance Studies International Conference comes to Stanford University, June 26\u201330 {{!}} Stanford Arts|url = http://arts.stanford.edu/performance-studies-international-conference-comes-to-stanford-university-june-26-30/|website = arts.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> at [[Stanford University]] (2013). Most recently the piece was installed at the National Gallery of Art in Sopot, Poland (2015). Articles about ''Tiresias'' have appeared in well respected academic journals, including an essay in ''[[TDR (journal)|The Drama Review]]'' by Maurya Wickstrom,<ref>{{cite journal|title = Desire and Kairos: Cassils's Terisias|journal = TDR/The Drama Review|volume = 58|pages = 46\u201355|url = https://www.academia.edu/10281646|accessdate = 2015-09-27|last1 = Wickstrom|first1 = Maurya}}</ref> and another in ''Performance Research Journal'' by Megan Hoetger.<ref>{{cite web|title = Past Issues - Performance Research Volume19, Issue3 - CPR|url = http://www.performance-research.org/past-issue-detail.php?issue_id=77|website = www.performance-research.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> Both journals featured images from the performance on their cover (2014).\n\n==Mid-career achievements==\nIn 2010, Cassils was awarded a Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Artist Research Grant as part of LACE's contribution to [[Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A., 1945-1980|Pacific Standard Time]], an initiative of the Getty with arts institutions across Southern California, showcasing cultural production from 1945-1980. LACE chose Cassils to make a new performance for their exhibition ''Los Angeles Goes Live: Exploring a Social History of Performance Art in Southern California (LAGA)''<ref>{{cite web|title = Los Angeles Goes Live: Performance Art in Southern California 1970-1983|url = http://welcometolace.org/lace/los-angeles-goes-live-performance-art-in-southern-california-1970-1983/|website = welcometolace.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> in which they were invited to use LACE's archive as a springboard from which to create a new work. Cassils created ''Cuts: A Traditional Sculpture'', a large body of work that began with a six-month durational performance and generated video installations, photographs, watercolors, and a magazine. This performance is a reinterpretation of Eleanor Antin's 1972 performance ''Carving: A Traditional Sculpture'', in which Antin crash dieted for 45 days and documented her body daily with photographs from four vantage points. Instead Cassils used their mastery of [[bodybuilding]] and nutrition to gain 23 pounds of muscle over 23 weeks, transforming their physique into a traditionally masculine muscular form.

The Red Army's [[4th Ukrainian Front]] engaged the German [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Army]] of [[Army Group A]], which consisted of [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian]] formations. The battles ended with the evacuation of the Crimea by the Germans. German and Romanian forces suffered considerable losses during the evacuation.\n[[File:Karte der Krim.png|thumb|right|Map of Crimea]]\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Kerch\u2013Eltigen Operation}}\nDuring late 1943 and early 1944, the Wehrmacht was pressed back along its entire front line in the east. In October 1943, the 17th Army withdrew from the [[Kuban bridgehead]] across the [[Kerch Strait]] into the Crimea. During the following months, the Red Army pushed back the Wehrmacht in southern [[Ukraine]], eventually cutting off the land-based connection of 17th Army through the [[Perekop Isthmus]] in November 1943.\n\nThe Wehrmacht was able to successfully hold on to the Crimea even after it had been cut off by land due to their ability to supply it via the Black Sea. Holding the Crimea was considered important as its loss would negatively affect the attitude of Turkey and put Romanian oilfields under risk of Soviet air attacks. Aside from [[Kerch\u2013Eltigen Operation|Soviet landings across the Kerch Strait]] and in the north-eastern sector near [[Sivash]] at the end of 1943, the Soviet Army largely ignored the Crimea for the next five months.\n\n[[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist]] was removed from the command of Army Group A on March 30, 1944. He was succeeded by [[Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner]].\n\n==Progress of the battle==\nAn assault across the Perekop Isthmus was launched on 8 April by elements of the [[4th Ukrainian Front]]'s [[2nd Guards Army|2nd Guards]] and [[51st Army (Russia)|51st Armies]].<ref name=\"Atlas\">{{cite book|title=Atlas of World War 2|last=Jordan|first=David|author2=Weist, Andrew|year=2004|publisher=Amber Books|location=London, England|isbn=0-7607-5557-4|pages= 124\u2013125}}<!--|accessdate=2010-03-19--></ref> The 17th Army defended but was unable to stop the advance.

However, the fortifications of the city had never been restored and Sevastopol was not the strong defensive position that it had been in 1941. Fighting broke out in the city outskirts towards the end of April and the city fell on 9 May, less than a month after the start of the offensive. The Axis sea evacuation to [[Constan\u021ba]] was attacked by Soviet land-based bombers.<ref name=\"Atlas\"/>\n\n===Evacuation of the Crimea===\n[[File:RegeleFerdinand1930-1944.jpg|thumb|left|Romanian destroyer ''Regele Ferdinand'']]\n[[File:Lancha G-5.svg|thumb|Soviet G-5-class motor torpedo boat]]\nThe evacuation of the Crimea in April\u2013May 1944 was the most complex and extensive operation of the Romanian Navy during the Second World War. From 15 April to 14 May, numerous German and Romanian warships escorted many convoys between Constan\u021ba and [[Sevastopol]]. The scale and importance of the operation can be attested by the usage in combat of all four Romanian destroyers, the largest Axis warships in the Black Sea. The last phase of the evacuation (10-14 May) saw the fiercest combat, as Axis ships transported, under constant attacks from Soviet aircraft and shore artillery, over 30,000 troops. Of these, 18,000 were transported by Romanian ships. On 11 May, the German tanker ''Friederike'' was torpedoed and heavily damaged by [[Soviet submarine L-4]], preventing her participation.<ref>[https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/4873.html] L-4 on uboat.net</ref>\nIn total,  Romanian and German convoys evacuated over 113,000 Axis troops from the Crimea, most of them (over 63,000) during the first phase of the evacuation (15\u201325 April). No Romanian Navy warships were lost during the evacuation, however the destroyer [[NMS Regele Ferdinand|''Regele Ferdinand'']] came close to being sunk. She was struck by a large aerial bomb, which fell in her fuel tanks, but failed to detonate. The bomb was extracted several days after the end of the operation. Two naval actions involving the Romanian Navy took place during the second phase of the evacuation (25 April\u201310 May), near [[Sevastopol]]. On 18 April, the Soviet [[Leninets-class submarine|''Leninets''-class]] submarine ''L-6'' was twice attacked with depth charges and damaged by the Romanian gunboat ''[[NMS Sublocotenent Ghiculescu|Ghiculescu]]'', numerous bubbles emerged from the depths after each attack, before being finished off by the German submarine hunter ''UJ-104''. During the night of 27 April, a convoy escorted by the Romanian gunboat ''Ghiculescu'', the German submarine hunter ''UJ-115'', one [[R-boat]], two KFK [[naval trawler]]s and 19 [[Marinef\u00e4hrprahm|MFPs]] (including the Romanian ''PTA-404'' and ''PTA-406'') engaged the Soviet [[G-5-class motor torpedo boat]]s ''TKA-332'', ''TKA-343'' and ''TKA-344'', after the three attacked and damaged the German submarine hunter ''UJ-104''. ''Ghiculescu'' opened fire with tracer rounds, enabling the entire escort group to locate the two Soviet MTBs and open fire. ''TKA-332'' was hit and sunk. Over 12 Soviet aircraft were also shot down during the evacuation, including two by the [[minelayer|minelaying]] [[destroyer escort]] ''Amiral Murgescu''. The last Axis pockets in the Crimea were destroyed on 12 May. The last Axis warship to leave the peninsula was ''Amiral Murgescu'', carrying on board 1,000 Axis troops, including the German General [[Walter Hartmann]].<ref>Jipa Rotaru, Ioan Damaschin, ''Glorie \u0219i dram\u0103: Marina Regal\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103, 1940-1945'', Ion Cristoiu Publishing, 2000, pp. 132-157 (in Romanian)</ref><ref>Nicolae Koslinski, Raymond St\u0103nescu, ''Marina rom\u00e2n\u0103 in al doilea r\u0103zboi mondial: 1942\u20131944'', F\u0103t Frumos Publishing, 1997 (in Romanian)</ref><ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Where the Iron Crosses Grow: The Crimea 1941\u201344'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014, Chapter 9</ref>\n\n[[File:1944 set of German ID's used during the Crimean offensive - Sevastopol and evacuation to Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|1944 set of German ID's used during the Crimean offensive -  Sevastopol and evacuation to Bulgaria.]]\n\n==Consequences==\nIn a meeting with Adolf Hitler in Berchtesgaden, Jaenecke had insisted that Sevastopol should be evacuated and his cut off Army of 235,000 men withdrawn. After the loss of the Crimea, he was held responsible, arrested in Romania and court-martialed. Only the intervention of [[Heinz Guderian]] saved his life. He was dismissed from the army on 31 January 1945.\n\nThe German and Romanian formations suffered the loss of 57,000 men, many of whom drowned during the evacuation. The sinking of the ''[[German ship Totila|Totila]]'' and ''[[German ship Teja|Teja]]'' on 10 May alone caused up to 10,000 deaths. In total, the German losses at sea amounted to five cargo ships, one tanker, three tugs, three lighters, three motorboats and four submarine hunters, while the Romanians lost three cargo ships.<ref>Nicolae Koslinski, Raymond St\u0103nescu, ''Marina rom\u00e2n\u0103 in al doilea r\u0103zboi mondial: 1942-1944'' (in Romanian)</ref><ref>Jipa Rotaru, Ioan Damaschin, ''Glorie \u0219i dram\u0103: Marina Regal\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103, 1940-1945'' (in Romanian)</ref> The partially successful evacuation of Axis troops from the Crimea earned the commander of the [[Romanian Navy]], Rear Admiral Horia Macellariu, the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]].<ref>Spencer C.

No Romanian Navy warships were lost during the evacuation, however the destroyer [[NMS Regele Ferdinand|''Regele Ferdinand'']] came close to being sunk. She was struck by a large aerial bomb, which fell in her fuel tanks, but failed to detonate. The bomb was extracted several days after the end of the operation. Two naval actions involving the Romanian Navy took place during the second phase of the evacuation (25 April\u201310 May), near [[Sevastopol]]. On 18 April, the Soviet [[Leninets-class submarine|''Leninets''-class]] submarine ''L-6'' was twice attacked with depth charges and damaged by the Romanian gunboat ''[[NMS Sublocotenent Ghiculescu|Ghiculescu]]'', numerous bubbles emerged from the depths after each attack, before being finished off by the German submarine hunter ''UJ-104''. During the night of 27 April, a convoy escorted by the Romanian gunboat ''Ghiculescu'', the German submarine hunter ''UJ-115'', one [[R-boat]], two KFK [[naval trawler]]s and 19 [[Marinef\u00e4hrprahm|MFPs]] (including the Romanian ''PTA-404'' and ''PTA-406'') engaged the Soviet [[G-5-class motor torpedo boat]]s ''TKA-332'', ''TKA-343'' and ''TKA-344'', after the three attacked and damaged the German submarine hunter ''UJ-104''. ''Ghiculescu'' opened fire with tracer rounds, enabling the entire escort group to locate the two Soviet MTBs and open fire. ''TKA-332'' was hit and sunk. Over 12 Soviet aircraft were also shot down during the evacuation, including two by the [[minelayer|minelaying]] [[destroyer escort]] ''Amiral Murgescu''. The last Axis pockets in the Crimea were destroyed on 12 May. The last Axis warship to leave the peninsula was ''Amiral Murgescu'', carrying on board 1,000 Axis troops, including the German General [[Walter Hartmann]].<ref>Jipa Rotaru, Ioan Damaschin, ''Glorie \u0219i dram\u0103: Marina Regal\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103, 1940-1945'', Ion Cristoiu Publishing, 2000, pp. 132-157 (in Romanian)</ref><ref>Nicolae Koslinski, Raymond St\u0103nescu, ''Marina rom\u00e2n\u0103 in al doilea r\u0103zboi mondial: 1942\u20131944'', F\u0103t Frumos Publishing, 1997 (in Romanian)</ref><ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Where the Iron Crosses Grow: The Crimea 1941\u201344'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014, Chapter 9</ref>\n\n[[File:1944 set of German ID's used during the Crimean offensive - Sevastopol and evacuation to Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|1944 set of German ID's used during the Crimean offensive -  Sevastopol and evacuation to Bulgaria.]]\n\n==Consequences==\nIn a meeting with Adolf Hitler in Berchtesgaden, Jaenecke had insisted that Sevastopol should be evacuated and his cut off Army of 235,000 men withdrawn. After the loss of the Crimea, he was held responsible, arrested in Romania and court-martialed. Only the intervention of [[Heinz Guderian]] saved his life. He was dismissed from the army on 31 January 1945.\n\nThe German and Romanian formations suffered the loss of 57,000 men, many of whom drowned during the evacuation. The sinking of the ''[[German ship Totila|Totila]]'' and ''[[German ship Teja|Teja]]'' on 10 May alone caused up to 10,000 deaths. In total, the German losses at sea amounted to five cargo ships, one tanker, three tugs, three lighters, three motorboats and four submarine hunters, while the Romanians lost three cargo ships.<ref>Nicolae Koslinski, Raymond St\u0103nescu, ''Marina rom\u00e2n\u0103 in al doilea r\u0103zboi mondial: 1942-1944'' (in Romanian)</ref><ref>Jipa Rotaru, Ioan Damaschin, ''Glorie \u0219i dram\u0103: Marina Regal\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103, 1940-1945'' (in Romanian)</ref> The partially successful evacuation of Axis troops from the Crimea earned the commander of the [[Romanian Navy]], Rear Admiral Horia Macellariu, the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]].<ref>Spencer C.

Croxton]], part of the force participating in [[Wilson's Raid]]. The Battle of Munford and a minor action at Hendersonville, North Carolina on the same day were the last battles of the [[American Civil War]] east of the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nThe [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers in the battle were described as convalescents, home guards, and pardoned deserters, while the Union cavalry was a veteran force armed with 7-shot [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer repeating carbines]]. The Confederate forces were commanded by General [[Benjamin Jefferson Hill]]. Confederate Lieutenant [[Lewis E. Parsons]] had two cannons which fired several rounds before they were overrun. The Union troops won the brief battle. Parsons was appointed provisional governor of Alabama in June after the war's end.\n\nThe Union and Confederate soldiers killed that day are described by author Rex Miller as the last to die in open combat by contending military forces.<ref>Miller, Rex, ''Croxton's Raid'', pp.80-81</ref>\n\n{{quote\n|THE LAST BATTLE.\n\nNumerous battles have been written up as \"the last fight of the rebellion.\" Without disputing in regard to the matter it is a fact, not generally known, that a battalion (the saber battalion) of the Second Michigan cavalry, under brevet Major Whittemore, charged the force under General Hill, near Talladega, Alabama, on the 23d of April, 1865, and was supported by the regiment and brigade, scattering the entire Confederate force and capturing the artillery, and many prisoners. This was fourteen days after the surrender at Appomattox, and therefore quite late enough after a cessation of hostilities. The next day the country was filled with small parties returning home\u2014a sadly broken down people.\n\n-Captain Marshall P.

The Battle of Munford and a minor action at Hendersonville, North Carolina on the same day were the last battles of the [[American Civil War]] east of the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nThe [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers in the battle were described as convalescents, home guards, and pardoned deserters, while the Union cavalry was a veteran force armed with 7-shot [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer repeating carbines]]. The Confederate forces were commanded by General [[Benjamin Jefferson Hill]]. Confederate Lieutenant [[Lewis E. Parsons]] had two cannons which fired several rounds before they were overrun. The Union troops won the brief battle. Parsons was appointed provisional governor of Alabama in June after the war's end.\n\nThe Union and Confederate soldiers killed that day are described by author Rex Miller as the last to die in open combat by contending military forces.<ref>Miller, Rex, ''Croxton's Raid'', pp.80-81</ref>\n\n{{quote\n|THE LAST BATTLE.\n\nNumerous battles have been written up as \"the last fight of the rebellion.\" Without disputing in regard to the matter it is a fact, not generally known, that a battalion (the saber battalion) of the Second Michigan cavalry, under brevet Major Whittemore, charged the force under General Hill, near Talladega, Alabama, on the 23d of April, 1865, and was supported by the regiment and brigade, scattering the entire Confederate force and capturing the artillery, and many prisoners. This was fourteen days after the surrender at Appomattox, and therefore quite late enough after a cessation of hostilities. The next day the country was filled with small parties returning home\u2014a sadly broken down people.\n\n-Captain Marshall P.
