{"title_page": "Inter Varsity Dance Competition", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2019}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2016}}\nThe '''Inter Varsity Dance Competition''' (IVDC) is an annual student [[dancesport]] competition organised by [[Inter Varsity Dance Association]] (IVDA). The IVDA write rules regarding entries, dress code and which dances will be part of the competition.\n\n[[File:Inter Varsity Dance Association (logo).gif|thumb|IVDC is organised by the Inter Varsity Dancesport Association]]\n\nAll UK universities may send representatives provided they are a member of the IVDA, and students who study at universities that do not have teams may gain special consideration to dance for another university. Currently approximately 33 UK universities take part in the competition.\n\nWhilst dancesport in the UK has seen a decline that shows like ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' have rectified, the [[Inter Varsity Dance Association]] (IVDA) has remained consistently popular and struggles to find a UK venue large enough for its annual competition. Since 2007 the competitions have been hosted at the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool|Winter Gardens]], [[Blackpool]].\n\nAt this time there is no student equivalent in other countries although the US has a strong student scene, and mainland Europe is building up its own competition scene.\n\n==Competition and events==\nIVDC is an annual event running since 1962 and hosted by different UK member universities and normally occurs in February or March each year. There are individual competitions during the day in ballroom, Latin, rock'n'roll, offbeat and the Team Match.<ref name=about>{{cite web | url=http://intervarsitydanceassociation.org/about/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512002005/http://intervarsitydanceassociation.org/about/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=12 May 2015 | title=About | publisher=Inter Varsity Dance Association | accessdate=14 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\nFor the Latin and Ballroom Events students are divided according to experience: Beginner, Novice, Intermediate and Advanced. Ex Students are also able to compete in some competitions. In lower ranking competitions dress restrictions apply. Beginners are encouraged and there is the \"Best Beginners Team Trophy\" which presented to the university with the most successful beginners overall.\nOther individual returnable trophies available:\n*The Timur Olegovich Gulinskiy Advanced modern Trophy (In memory of a Leeds Dancesport Student who died whilst studying in 2000)\n*The Novice Modern Trophy \n*The Intermediate Modern Trophy\n*The Far\u2019s Advanced Latin Trophy \n*The Novice Latin Trophy \n*The Intermediate Latin Trophy \n*Ex-students ballroom trophy \n*Ex-students Latin trophy\n*The Dance Basics best Beginners\u2019 Trophy (awarded to the Beginner couple finishing highest over all four Beginners\u2019 events) \n*The Choice of London Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Trophy \n*The Edna Murphy Shield (presented to the most promising couple, as decided by the Chairman of Adjudicators)\n*The Far\u2019s Dance Best Newcomer Trophy (awarded to the couple who receive the highestmarks in the team match and who have never competed in an IVDC team match before)\n\nThe Offbeat Competition is a \"Fun\" team \"freestyle\" even - the university can enter a 3-minute routine in any dance style. Interpretations vary from fun routines such as \"The Full Monty\" to serious high quality street dance routines. The Offbeat Winners Shield is presented to the winning team.\n\nThe most important event of the competition is the team match, which pits teams of 32 dancers from each member university against each other (These are split into teams of 8: A, B, C, D). This competition has undergone a drastic overhaul in recent years following innovations by Alistair Braden whilst at [[Bristol University]].

The IVDA write rules regarding entries, dress code and which dances will be part of the competition.\n\n[[File:Inter Varsity Dance Association (logo).gif|thumb|IVDC is organised by the Inter Varsity Dancesport Association]]\n\nAll UK universities may send representatives provided they are a member of the IVDA, and students who study at universities that do not have teams may gain special consideration to dance for another university. Currently approximately 33 UK universities take part in the competition.\n\nWhilst dancesport in the UK has seen a decline that shows like ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' have rectified, the [[Inter Varsity Dance Association]] (IVDA) has remained consistently popular and struggles to find a UK venue large enough for its annual competition. Since 2007 the competitions have been hosted at the [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool|Winter Gardens]], [[Blackpool]].\n\nAt this time there is no student equivalent in other countries although the US has a strong student scene, and mainland Europe is building up its own competition scene.\n\n==Competition and events==\nIVDC is an annual event running since 1962 and hosted by different UK member universities and normally occurs in February or March each year. There are individual competitions during the day in ballroom, Latin, rock'n'roll, offbeat and the Team Match.<ref name=about>{{cite web | url=http://intervarsitydanceassociation.org/about/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512002005/http://intervarsitydanceassociation.org/about/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=12 May 2015 | title=About | publisher=Inter Varsity Dance Association | accessdate=14 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\nFor the Latin and Ballroom Events students are divided according to experience: Beginner, Novice, Intermediate and Advanced. Ex Students are also able to compete in some competitions. In lower ranking competitions dress restrictions apply. Beginners are encouraged and there is the \"Best Beginners Team Trophy\" which presented to the university with the most successful beginners overall.\nOther individual returnable trophies available:\n*The Timur Olegovich Gulinskiy Advanced modern Trophy (In memory of a Leeds Dancesport Student who died whilst studying in 2000)\n*The Novice Modern Trophy \n*The Intermediate Modern Trophy\n*The Far\u2019s Advanced Latin Trophy \n*The Novice Latin Trophy \n*The Intermediate Latin Trophy \n*Ex-students ballroom trophy \n*Ex-students Latin trophy\n*The Dance Basics best Beginners\u2019 Trophy (awarded to the Beginner couple finishing highest over all four Beginners\u2019 events) \n*The Choice of London Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Trophy \n*The Edna Murphy Shield (presented to the most promising couple, as decided by the Chairman of Adjudicators)\n*The Far\u2019s Dance Best Newcomer Trophy (awarded to the couple who receive the highestmarks in the team match and who have never competed in an IVDC team match before)\n\nThe Offbeat Competition is a \"Fun\" team \"freestyle\" even - the university can enter a 3-minute routine in any dance style. Interpretations vary from fun routines such as \"The Full Monty\" to serious high quality street dance routines. The Offbeat Winners Shield is presented to the winning team.\n\nThe most important event of the competition is the team match, which pits teams of 32 dancers from each member university against each other (These are split into teams of 8: A, B, C, D). This competition has undergone a drastic overhaul in recent years following innovations by Alistair Braden whilst at [[Bristol University]]. The team match is now a two-division system that ranks all universities entered, instead of the traditional team match.\nThe following Team Trophies are awarded at IVDC:\n*The EADA Overall IVDA Champions Trophy (presented to the university placed first in the overall rankings) \n*The Choice IVDA Overall Runners-Up Trophy\n*The Far\u2019s Dance A-Team Winners Trophy \n*The Choice IVDA A-Team Runners-Up Trophy \n*The B-Team Winners Shield \n*The IDTA B-TEam Runners-Up Trophy \n*The C-Team Winners Shield \n*The IDTA C-Team Runners-Up Trophy \n*The D-Team Winners Trophy \n*The IDTA D-Team Runners-Up Trophy \n*The EADA IVDA Division 2 Winners Trophy \n*The Choice IVDA Division 2 Runners-Up Trophy \n*The IVDA Challenge Trophy (presented to the highest-placed university composed entirely of teams in division 2)\n\nThe trophies held in the highest regard are the EADA Overall trophy and the A-Team trophy.\n\n== History of results ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
