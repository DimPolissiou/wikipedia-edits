The first, a miniature painted on ivory, was painted while Bruegel was in Rome and is now lost.<ref>Orenstein, 6, one of the works belonging to [[Giulio Clovio]]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Morra|first=Joanne|title=Utopia Lost: Allegory, Ruins and Pieter Bruegel\u2019s Towers of Babel|journal=Art History|year=2007|volume=30|issue=2|pages=200|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8365.2007.00538.x}}</ref> The two surviving paintings, often distinguished by the prefix \"Great\" and \"Little\", are in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]] and the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] in [[Rotterdam]] respectively.  Both are [[oil painting]]s on wood panels.\n\nThe Rotterdam painting is about half the size of the Vienna one. In broad terms they have exactly the same composition, but at a detailed level everything is different, whether in the architecture of the tower or in the sky and the landscape around the tower.  The Vienna version has a group in the foreground, with the main figure presumably [[Nimrod]], who was believed to have ordered the construction of the tower,<ref name=\"Art and the Bible\" /> although the Bible does not actually say this.  In Vienna the tower rises at the edge of a large city, but the Rotterdam tower is in open countryside. \n\nThe paintings depict the construction of the [[Tower of Babel]], which, according to the [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Bible]], was built by a unified, [[Confusion of tongues|monolingual]] humanity as a mark of their achievement and to prevent them from scattering: \"Then they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.'\" (Genesis 11:4).\n\n==Description and analysis==\nBruegel's depiction of the architecture of the tower, with its numerous arches and other examples of [[Roman engineering]], is deliberately reminiscent of the Roman [[Colosseum]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Malam|first=John|title=Pieter Bruegel|year=1999|publisher=Carolrhoda Books|isbn=1-57505-366-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pieterbreugel0000mala/page/15 15]|url=https://archive.org/details/pieterbreugel0000mala/page/15}}</ref> which Christians of the time saw as a symbol of both hubris and persecution. Bruegel had visited [[Rome]] in 1552\u20131553. Back in [[Antwerp]], he may have refreshed his memory of Rome with a series of engravings of the principal landmarks of the city made by the publisher of his own prints, [[Hieronymous Cock]], for he incorporated details of Cock's engravings of Roman views in both surviving versions of the ''Tower of Babel''.  \n\nThe parallel of Rome and [[Babylon]] had a particular significance for Bruegel's contemporaries: Rome was the Eternal City, intended by the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]] to last forever, and its decay and ruin were taken to symbolize the vanity and transience of earthly efforts.<ref name=\"Art and the Bible\">{{cite web|title=The Tower of Babel|url=http://www.artbible.info/art/tower-of-babel.html|work=Art and the Bible|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}</ref> The Tower was also symbolic of the religious turmoil between the [[Catholic Church]] (which at the time conducted all services in Latin) and the polyglot Protestant religion that was increasingly popular in the [[Netherlands]].  The subject may have had a specific topicality, as the famous [[Plantin Polyglot|Polyglot Bible]] in six languages, a landmark in Biblical scholarship, was published in Antwerp in 1566.<ref>Snyder, 502</ref>  Although at first glance the tower appears to be a stable series of concentric pillars, upon closer examination it is apparent that none of the layers lies at a true horizontal. Rather the tower is built as an ascending spiral.\n\nThe workers in the painting have built the [[arch]]es perpendicular to the slanted ground, thereby making them unstable, and a few arches can already be seen crumbling. The foundation and bottom layers of the tower had not been completed before the higher layers were constructed.\n[[File:La Tour de Babel, Van Valckenborch, 1594.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Van Valckenborch's ''Tower of Babel'' 1594]]\n[[Lucas van Valckenborch]], a contemporary of Bruegel's, also painted the Tower of Babel in the 1560s and later in his career, possibly after seeing Bruegel's depiction.<ref name=\"Art and the Bible\" /> Both were part of a larger tradition of painting the tower during the 16th and 17th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|last=West|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew West (linguist)|title=72 More Views of the Tower of Babel|url=http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2008/12/72-more-views-of-tower-of-babel.html|work=BabelStone|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}</ref>  \n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (detail) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail at right side, with original rock formation.]]\n\nThe story of the [[Tower of Babel]] (like that in [[The Suicide of Saul]], Bruegel's only other painting with an [[Old Testament]] subject) was interpreted as an example of pride punished, and that is no doubt what Bruegel intended his painting to illustrate.<ref>Orenstein, 58</ref> Moreover, the hectic activity of the engineers, masons and workmen points to a second moral: the futility of much human endeavour. [[Nimrod]]'s doomed building was used to illustrate this meaning in [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]]''.<ref>This book's online text may be viewed at [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20179 ''The Ship of Fools''], [[Project Gutenberg]]. See also article by N. Collins, on [http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/tower-of-babel.htm Encyclopedia of Art Education] Accessed 4 February 2012</ref> Bruegel's knowledge of building procedures and techniques is considerable and correct in detail.

Both are [[oil painting]]s on wood panels.\n\nThe Rotterdam painting is about half the size of the Vienna one. In broad terms they have exactly the same composition, but at a detailed level everything is different, whether in the architecture of the tower or in the sky and the landscape around the tower.  The Vienna version has a group in the foreground, with the main figure presumably [[Nimrod]], who was believed to have ordered the construction of the tower,<ref name=\"Art and the Bible\" /> although the Bible does not actually say this.  In Vienna the tower rises at the edge of a large city, but the Rotterdam tower is in open countryside. \n\nThe paintings depict the construction of the [[Tower of Babel]], which, according to the [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Bible]], was built by a unified, [[Confusion of tongues|monolingual]] humanity as a mark of their achievement and to prevent them from scattering: \"Then they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.'\" (Genesis 11:4).\n\n==Description and analysis==\nBruegel's depiction of the architecture of the tower, with its numerous arches and other examples of [[Roman engineering]], is deliberately reminiscent of the Roman [[Colosseum]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Malam|first=John|title=Pieter Bruegel|year=1999|publisher=Carolrhoda Books|isbn=1-57505-366-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pieterbreugel0000mala/page/15 15]|url=https://archive.org/details/pieterbreugel0000mala/page/15}}</ref> which Christians of the time saw as a symbol of both hubris and persecution. Bruegel had visited [[Rome]] in 1552\u20131553. Back in [[Antwerp]], he may have refreshed his memory of Rome with a series of engravings of the principal landmarks of the city made by the publisher of his own prints, [[Hieronymous Cock]], for he incorporated details of Cock's engravings of Roman views in both surviving versions of the ''Tower of Babel''.  \n\nThe parallel of Rome and [[Babylon]] had a particular significance for Bruegel's contemporaries: Rome was the Eternal City, intended by the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]] to last forever, and its decay and ruin were taken to symbolize the vanity and transience of earthly efforts.<ref name=\"Art and the Bible\">{{cite web|title=The Tower of Babel|url=http://www.artbible.info/art/tower-of-babel.html|work=Art and the Bible|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}</ref> The Tower was also symbolic of the religious turmoil between the [[Catholic Church]] (which at the time conducted all services in Latin) and the polyglot Protestant religion that was increasingly popular in the [[Netherlands]].  The subject may have had a specific topicality, as the famous [[Plantin Polyglot|Polyglot Bible]] in six languages, a landmark in Biblical scholarship, was published in Antwerp in 1566.<ref>Snyder, 502</ref>  Although at first glance the tower appears to be a stable series of concentric pillars, upon closer examination it is apparent that none of the layers lies at a true horizontal. Rather the tower is built as an ascending spiral.\n\nThe workers in the painting have built the [[arch]]es perpendicular to the slanted ground, thereby making them unstable, and a few arches can already be seen crumbling. The foundation and bottom layers of the tower had not been completed before the higher layers were constructed.\n[[File:La Tour de Babel, Van Valckenborch, 1594.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Van Valckenborch's ''Tower of Babel'' 1594]]\n[[Lucas van Valckenborch]], a contemporary of Bruegel's, also painted the Tower of Babel in the 1560s and later in his career, possibly after seeing Bruegel's depiction.<ref name=\"Art and the Bible\" /> Both were part of a larger tradition of painting the tower during the 16th and 17th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|last=West|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew West (linguist)|title=72 More Views of the Tower of Babel|url=http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2008/12/72-more-views-of-tower-of-babel.html|work=BabelStone|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}</ref>  \n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (detail) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail at right side, with original rock formation.]]\n\nThe story of the [[Tower of Babel]] (like that in [[The Suicide of Saul]], Bruegel's only other painting with an [[Old Testament]] subject) was interpreted as an example of pride punished, and that is no doubt what Bruegel intended his painting to illustrate.<ref>Orenstein, 58</ref> Moreover, the hectic activity of the engineers, masons and workmen points to a second moral: the futility of much human endeavour. [[Nimrod]]'s doomed building was used to illustrate this meaning in [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]]''.<ref>This book's online text may be viewed at [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20179 ''The Ship of Fools''], [[Project Gutenberg]].

It is descended from [[Middle Turkic languages|Middle Turkic]], which served as a [[lingua franca]] in Central Asia, with a strong infusion of [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] words and turns of phrase. Its literary form was based on two earlier literary [[Middle Turkic languages]], Karakhanid and [[Khorezmian language (Turkic)|Khorezmian]]. It can be divided into three periods:\n# Pre-classical Chagatai (1400&ndash;1465).\n# Classical Chagatai (1465&ndash;1600).\n# Post-classical Chagatai (1600&ndash;1921).\n\nThe first period is a transitional phase characterized by the retention of archaic forms; the second phase starts with the publication of Ali-Shir Nava'i's first Divan and is the highpoint of Chagatai literature, followed by the third phase, which is characterized by two bifurcating developments. One is the preservation of the classical Chagatai language of Nava'i, the other trend is the increasing influence of the dialects of the local spoken languages.\n\n==Influence on later Turkic languages==\n[[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] are the two modern languages most closely related to Chagatai. Uzbeks regard Chagatai as the origin of their own language and claim Chagatai literature as their own. In 1921 in [[Uzbekistan]], then a part of the [[Soviet Union]], Chagatai was replaced by a literary language based on a local Uzbek dialect. \n\nThe [[Berendei]], a 12th-century nomadic Turkic people possibly related to the Cumans, seem also to have spoken Chagatai.{{source?|date=February 2020}}<!-- fantastic -->\n\n''[[Ethnologue]]'' records the use of the word \"Chagatai\" in [[Afghanistan]] to describe the \"Tekke\" dialect of [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]].  Up to and including the eighteenth century, Chagatai was the main literary language in [[Turkmenistan]] as well as most of Central Asia. While it had some influence on Turkmen, the two languages belong to different branches of the Turkic language family.\n\n==Literature==\n===15th and 16th centuries===\nThe most famous of the Chagatai poets is Ali-Shir Nava'i, who \u2013 among his other works \u2013 wrote ''[[Muhakamat al-Lughatayn]]'', a detailed comparison of the Chagatai and Persian languages, in which he argued for the superiority of the former for literary purposes. His fame is attested by the fact that Chagatai is sometimes called \"Nava'i's language\". Among prose works, [[Timur]]'s biography is written in Chagatai, as is  the famous ''[[Baburnama]]'' (or ''Tuska Babure'') of [[Babur]], the Timurid founder of  the [[Mughal Empire]]. A [https://www.fihrist.org.uk/catalog/manuscript_8630 ''Divan''] attributed to [[Kamran Mirza]] is written in Persian and Chagatai, and one of [[Bairam Khan]]'s [https://archive.org/details/ThePersianAndTurkishDivansOfBayramKhan ''Divans''] was written in the Chagatai language.\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nImportant writings in Chagatai from the period between the 17th and 18th centuries include those of [[Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur]]: ''[[Shajare-i Tarakime|Shajarayi Tarakima]]'' (Genealogy of the Turkmens) and [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy5lCWdQ5noC ''Shajarayi T\u00fcrk''] (Genealogy of the Turks).\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\nProminent 19th century Khivan writers include [[Shermuhammad Munis]] and his nephew [[Muhammad Riza Agahi]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/art/Uzbek-literature]; Qahhar, Tahir, and William Dirks. \u201cUzbek Literature.\u201d World Literature Today, vol. 70, no. 3, 1996, pp. 611\u2013618.

It is descended from [[Middle Turkic languages|Middle Turkic]], which served as a [[lingua franca]] in Central Asia, with a strong infusion of [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] words and turns of phrase. Its literary form was based on two earlier literary [[Middle Turkic languages]], Karakhanid and [[Khorezmian language (Turkic)|Khorezmian]]. It can be divided into three periods:\n# Pre-classical Chagatai (1400&ndash;1465).\n# Classical Chagatai (1465&ndash;1600).\n# Post-classical Chagatai (1600&ndash;1921).\n\nThe first period is a transitional phase characterized by the retention of archaic forms; the second phase starts with the publication of Ali-Shir Nava'i's first Divan and is the highpoint of Chagatai literature, followed by the third phase, which is characterized by two bifurcating developments. One is the preservation of the classical Chagatai language of Nava'i, the other trend is the increasing influence of the dialects of the local spoken languages.\n\n==Influence on later Turkic languages==\n[[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] are the two modern languages most closely related to Chagatai. Uzbeks regard Chagatai as the origin of their own language and claim Chagatai literature as their own. In 1921 in [[Uzbekistan]], then a part of the [[Soviet Union]], Chagatai was replaced by a literary language based on a local Uzbek dialect. \n\nThe [[Berendei]], a 12th-century nomadic Turkic people possibly related to the Cumans, seem also to have spoken Chagatai.{{source?|date=February 2020}}<!-- fantastic -->\n\n''[[Ethnologue]]'' records the use of the word \"Chagatai\" in [[Afghanistan]] to describe the \"Tekke\" dialect of [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]].  Up to and including the eighteenth century, Chagatai was the main literary language in [[Turkmenistan]] as well as most of Central Asia. While it had some influence on Turkmen, the two languages belong to different branches of the Turkic language family.\n\n==Literature==\n===15th and 16th centuries===\nThe most famous of the Chagatai poets is Ali-Shir Nava'i, who \u2013 among his other works \u2013 wrote ''[[Muhakamat al-Lughatayn]]'', a detailed comparison of the Chagatai and Persian languages, in which he argued for the superiority of the former for literary purposes. His fame is attested by the fact that Chagatai is sometimes called \"Nava'i's language\". Among prose works, [[Timur]]'s biography is written in Chagatai, as is  the famous ''[[Baburnama]]'' (or ''Tuska Babure'') of [[Babur]], the Timurid founder of  the [[Mughal Empire]].

He is best known for his solo acoustic [[fingerstyle guitar]] work, but he is also a skilled [[Flatpicking|flatpicker]] and autoharp player who performs and records with [[dobro]], [[mandolin]], [[mandocello]], [[bouzouki]] and [[six-string banjo]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/harvey-reid-mn0000951687/biography |title=Artist Biography by Larry Belanger |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2018-08-17}}</ref> Reid is married to New Hampshire-born fiddler/singer/songwriter Joyce Andersen, and they have two children.\n\nHe has been a full-time musician since 1976, and has released 25 recordings on the Woodpecker label containing nearly 500 tracks of original, traditional and contemporary acoustic music. Reid won the 1981 National Fingerpicking Guitar competition and the 1982 International Autoharp contest and has performed over 6000 concerts in most of the 50 states and a number of countries in Europe. Reid also won [[Bill Monroe]]'s Beanblossom bluegrass guitar contest in 1976. His 1989 CD ''Solo Guitar Sketchbook,'' which has remained his best-selling recording, was chosen by ''Guitar Player Magazine'' for their ''Desert Island Top 20 Acoustic Guitar'' list. In 1992 Reid released another direct-to-digital solo all-traditional recording, ''Steel Drivin' Man'' that earned Reid a place in the ''Acoustic Guitar Magazine Top 10 Folk CD's of All Time'' list.\n\nHe is responsible for quite a number of musical innovations, in addition to his considerable body of recorded and published work. Reid is one of the first artists to start his own record label, and he has successfully run Woodpecker Records since 1982 when he released his first LP of solo acoustic guitar, titled ''Nothin' but Guitar.'' After one more LP release in 1983 and 2 cassettes in 1986 and 1987, Reid released in 1988 what many consider to be the first ''indie'' CD, titled ''Of Wind & Water.'' Reid's DAT recordings from that period were possibly the first releases to be done [[direct-to-digital]] master, without any edits or [[overdubs]], and he was among the earliest to embrace the digital revolution in independent music.\n\nAll of Reid's recordings feature extensive use of a number of types and nearly two dozen configurations of [[partial capo]],<ref name=\"Allmusic\" /> and he is the first modern person to compose, arrange, record and publish guitar music played with this device. Reid self-published a book in May 1980 about it, titled ''A New Frontier in Guitar,'' that is also probably the first desktop-published book ever made. It was done with a beta version of ''[[Scribe (software)|Scribe]]'' software, a Xerox ''[[Alto (computer)|Alto]]'' computer (the predecessor to the [[Apple Macintosh]]) and a prototype ''Diablo'' laser printer. Also in 1980, Reid co-founded the ''Third Hand Capo Company'' with Jefferson Hickey, and has been responsible for spreading the partial [[capo]] idea around the acoustic guitar world.<ref name=\"Allmusic\" /> He has now written 6 books on the subject, and is actively working at present on a series of instructional works showing how to use this device to expand the capabilities of the guitar. He also combines the partial capo with alternate guitar tunings&nbsp;\u2014 e.g. the so-called Liberty Tuning uses the second string raised by a semitone (B \u2192 C) plus the partial capo on the 4th fret of the second to fourth or second to fifth strings.

He is best known for his solo acoustic [[fingerstyle guitar]] work, but he is also a skilled [[Flatpicking|flatpicker]] and autoharp player who performs and records with [[dobro]], [[mandolin]], [[mandocello]], [[bouzouki]] and [[six-string banjo]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/harvey-reid-mn0000951687/biography |title=Artist Biography by Larry Belanger |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2018-08-17}}</ref> Reid is married to New Hampshire-born fiddler/singer/songwriter Joyce Andersen, and they have two children.\n\nHe has been a full-time musician since 1976, and has released 25 recordings on the Woodpecker label containing nearly 500 tracks of original, traditional and contemporary acoustic music. Reid won the 1981 National Fingerpicking Guitar competition and the 1982 International Autoharp contest and has performed over 6000 concerts in most of the 50 states and a number of countries in Europe. Reid also won [[Bill Monroe]]'s Beanblossom bluegrass guitar contest in 1976. His 1989 CD ''Solo Guitar Sketchbook,'' which has remained his best-selling recording, was chosen by ''Guitar Player Magazine'' for their ''Desert Island Top 20 Acoustic Guitar'' list. In 1992 Reid released another direct-to-digital solo all-traditional recording, ''Steel Drivin' Man'' that earned Reid a place in the ''Acoustic Guitar Magazine Top 10 Folk CD's of All Time'' list.\n\nHe is responsible for quite a number of musical innovations, in addition to his considerable body of recorded and published work. Reid is one of the first artists to start his own record label, and he has successfully run Woodpecker Records since 1982 when he released his first LP of solo acoustic guitar, titled ''Nothin' but Guitar.'' After one more LP release in 1983 and 2 cassettes in 1986 and 1987, Reid released in 1988 what many consider to be the first ''indie'' CD, titled ''Of Wind & Water.'' Reid's DAT recordings from that period were possibly the first releases to be done [[direct-to-digital]] master, without any edits or [[overdubs]], and he was among the earliest to embrace the digital revolution in independent music.\n\nAll of Reid's recordings feature extensive use of a number of types and nearly two dozen configurations of [[partial capo]],<ref name=\"Allmusic\" /> and he is the first modern person to compose, arrange, record and publish guitar music played with this device. Reid self-published a book in May 1980 about it, titled ''A New Frontier in Guitar,'' that is also probably the first desktop-published book ever made. It was done with a beta version of ''[[Scribe (software)|Scribe]]'' software, a Xerox ''[[Alto (computer)|Alto]]'' computer (the predecessor to the [[Apple Macintosh]]) and a prototype ''Diablo'' laser printer. Also in 1980, Reid co-founded the ''Third Hand Capo Company'' with Jefferson Hickey, and has been responsible for spreading the partial [[capo]] idea around the acoustic guitar world.<ref name=\"Allmusic\" /> He has now written 6 books on the subject, and is actively working at present on a series of instructional works showing how to use this device to expand the capabilities of the guitar. He also combines the partial capo with alternate guitar tunings&nbsp;\u2014 e.g. the so-called Liberty Tuning uses the second string raised by a semitone (B \u2192 C) plus the partial capo on the 4th fret of the second to fourth or second to fifth strings. In 1984 Reid also co-wrote the first college textbook for folk guitar, ''Modern Folk Guitar'' that was published by [[Random House]], which remains in print and in use in university music departments.<ref name=\"Allmusic\" />\n\nReid is also responsible for the appearance of the Fishman ''Acoustic Blender'' amplification system,<ref name=\"Allmusic\" /> and has been involved with the evolution of a number of on-stage acoustic guitar amplification tools. He was also the first artist to endorse the [[Taylor Guitar]] brand,<ref name=\"Allmusic\" /> and has been involved with a number of instrument and equipment manufacturers, helping to design and stage-test gear for modern acoustic musicians.
