It has many names depending on the country and region. These drums are commonly used in the music of Middle East. These drums have both a deep [[bass drum|bass sound]] and a thin [[treble (sound)|treble]] sound due to their construction and playing style, where different heads and sticks are used to produce different sounds on the same drum.\n\n==Names==\nSome names of davuls include:\n\n*'''tupan''' ([[Gora dialect|Goranian]]: Tupan)\n*'''dahol''' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: ''dahol'', [[Southern Kurdish|Southern Kurdish]]: ''D\u00eewe\u0142'')\n*'''davul''' ({{lang-tr|davul}},  literally meaning \"drum\")\n*'''davil''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: davil)\n*'''davula''' ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]])\n*'''daul''', '''t\u01cepan''', '''tupan''' ({{lang-bg|\u0442\u044a\u043f\u0430\u043d, \u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043d}})\n*'''go\u010d''' (goch) ({{lang-sr|\u0433\u043e\u0447}})\n*'''tapan''' ({{lang-mk|\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0430\u043d}})\n*'''tob\u0103/dob\u0103''' ({{lang-ro |tob\u0103}})\n*'''tabl''' ({{lang-ar|tabl}} or ''tabl baladi'')\n*'''tof''' ({{lang-he|tof \u05ea\u05d5\u05e3}})\n*'''daouli''' ({{lang-el|\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9}}),  literally meaning \"drum\"\n*'''lodra''', '''tupana''', '''daulle''' ({{lang-sq|lodra}})\n*'''[[dohol]]''' ({{lang-fa|'''\u062f\u0647\u0644''' dohol}})\n*'''doli''' ({{lang-ka|  \u10d3\u10dd\u10da\u10d8  doli}})\n*'''dhol''' ({{lang-hy|\u0564\u0570\u0578\u056c dhol}})\n*'''dawola/davola''' ({{lang-syr|\u071b\u0732\u0712\u073c\u0720\u0735\u0710}})\n*'''moldvai dob''' (Hungarian: ''moldvai dob'')\n*'''Dawula''' (Sri Lankan ancient Drum)\nOther [[Greek language|Greek]] names for this drum include Davouli, Argano, Toskani, Tsokani, Toubi, Toubaki, Kiossi, Tavouli, Pavouli, Toubano, and Toubaneli.  Additionally, other names for the daouli, depending on the area, include toumpano, tymbano, or toumbi, which stem from the {{Lang-grc|\u03c4\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|ty&#833;mpanon}}); this word exists in English in the word [[tympani]] for the drum section in the modern classical orchestra and the tympanic membrane for the [[eardrum]].\n\n==Traditional uses==\nIn the southern Balkans, the rhythm of the tapan is complex and utilizes many accents in numerous traditional time signatures. In Macedonia, tapans are most often used to accompany other instruments such as the [[zurla (instrument)|zurla]] and [[gaida]], while in Bulgaria they usually accompany [[gaida]] and [[gadulka]].  They are also played solo in some Albanian, Bulgarian and Macedonian folk dances and songs. For centuries the tapan is irreplaceable at Bulgarian village festivities such as weddings and celebrations of patron saints of homes and villages. In Romania and Moldova the toba is sometimes used to accompany dances. In the regions of Moldavia, Maramures and Bihor there are also some varieties with a small cymbal mounted on top. They are generally struck with a wooden mallet on one skin and with a thinner stick on the rim or cymbal.\n\nIn Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia, the davul is most commonly played with the [[zurna]], although it can be played with other instruments and in ensembles as well. It has also traditionally been used for communication and for Turkish [[mehter]], or [[janissary]] music. In Iraq and the Levant, it is predominantly used in [[Assyrian folk dance]] and [[Assyrian folk/pop music]], among [[Assyrian people]], which are mostly accompanied by a [[zurna]], a [[wind instrument]]. In Armenia the dhol does not have as large of a circumference and is usually played with the hands, although a wooden, spoon-shaped drumstick is also used. It is frequently heard in Armenian folk music. Not only is it in folk music but also in modern music as well, even having solos in many prominent songs.<ref>[http://karalahana.com/english/dauli-drum.html Dauli - Davul of Turkey.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930225349/http://www.karalahana.com/english/dauli-drum.html |date=2014-09-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Karagoez davulcu2.jpg|thumb|right|''Davul'' in shadow puppet theater. Here, [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat|Karag\u00f6z]] is shown with his ''davul''.]]\nThe drum shell is made of hard wood, perhaps walnut or chestnut, though many woods may be in use depending on the region where the drum is made.  To make the shell, the wood is boiled in water to make it bendable, and then it is bent into a cylindrical shape and fastened together.  The [[drumhead|heads]] are usually goat skin, and they are shaped into circles by wooden frames.  However, one head may be goat skin to provide a higher tone, while the other head can be sheepskin, calfskin, or even donkey-skin to provide a lower tone.  Some say that wolf skin and even dog skin are preferred.<ref name=gkins>{{cite web|title=Greek Musical Instruments|url=http://www.greekfolkmusicanddance.com/instruments.php |publisher=John Pappas |accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>  Rope threaded back and forth across the shell of the drum, from head to head in a zigzag pattern, holds the heads on the drum and provides tension for tuning the drum.  Sometimes metal rings or leather straps join neighboring strands of the rope in order to allow for further tuning.  Two rings are sometimes attached to the main rope where a belt-like rope is threaded through to hold the drum.\n\nIn the former Yugoslavian republics and Bulgaria, the tapan is made in two dimensions, {{lang-bg|golem}}, at about 50 \u2013 55&nbsp;cm diameter, and {{lang-bg|mal}} or tapanche, at about 30 \u2013 35&nbsp;cm diameter.\n\nIn Turkey, davuls typically range in size from 60&nbsp;cm to 90&nbsp;cm in diameter.  Cow hide is used for the bass pitch drum head side, while goat skin is used for the thin, high pitched side.\n\nIn Greece, daouli can be 12 to 14&nbsp;inches for the toumbi up to 3 to 4 feet for daouli.  Commonly the drum is about 20 to 30&nbsp;inches.<ref name=\"gkins\"/>\n\n==Playing style==\nPlayers often use a rope hooked to the drum to hold the drum sideways, so that one head is accessible with the left hand and one with the right.  Each hand is usually dedicated to playing one side of the drum exclusively, though this can vary by local style and tradition.\n\nDrummers of this drum typically uses two kinds of sticks. The drummer plays the accented beats with the dominant hand on the side of the drum with the thicker skin, using a special stick known as the {{lang-bg|kukuda or ukanj}}, {{lang-tr|tokmak}}, or {{lang-el|daouloxylo}} (daouli stick).<ref name=\"gkins\"/>  This stick is a thick pipe-like stick about 440&nbsp;mm long, which is often made with walnut.  Its thick shape as well as the thickness of the head give the accented beats a low, full sound.  Sometimes the drumhead played with the thick stick is also muted with a cloth to enhance the fundamental low note of the drum.  Unaccented beats are played by the nondominant hand on the side of the drum having the thin skin, using a thin stick or switch called {{lang-bg|pracka}}, {{lang-tr|\u00e7ubuk}}, or {{lang-el|daouloverga}} (daouli switch).<ref name=\"gkins\"/>  This thin stick is often held cross-grip, and the drummer can quickly hit thin accent strokes by gently twisting the wrist.  These thin sticks are often made from soft wood such as willow or [[European Cornel|cornel]].\n\nThe Balkan school of tapan playing presumes the playing (not the accompaniment) of a melody, where the non-dominant hand is used to express all that the player wishes to say, while the dominant hand is only used to accentuate certain moments in the melody.\n\nThe [[Macedonian Australians | Macedonian Australian]] drummer Chris Mitrevski pioneered a hybrid style of playing, relying on multiple accented notes played by the non-dominant hand.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} This style is difficult to play but results in a very complex poly-rhythm, with the dominant hand accenting the down beat.\n\n==See also==<!-- PLSE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n{{Portal|Music}}\n*[[Bendir]]\n*[[Daf]]\n*[[Dhol]]\n*[[Mazhar]]\n*[[Nagara (drum)]]\n*[[Riq]]\n*[[Tar (drum)]]\n*[[Timpani]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080128185946/http://www.discoverturkey.com/english/kultursanat/b-h-davul.html Discover Turkey information page on davul with sound clips]\n*[http://musicalconfrontations.com/MC5/wlc/mcb/cul/mim/mfl/mtm/foc/JNS/jns0000000002.htm History of the Davul, from ancient times until the 18th century; in German: Janissary instruments and Europe]\n*[http://www.greekfolkmusicanddance.com/instruments.php Greek musical instruments]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080223121438/http://beloplatno.rastko.net/instrumenti/instrumenti_en.html Serbian musical instruments]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150412032206/http://pontosworld.com/index.php/music/instruments/1316-the-daouli-drum Pontic Daouli]\n\n{{Armenian musical instruments}}\n{{Greek musical instruments}}\n{{Iranian musical instruments}}\n{{Turkish musical instruments}}\n{{Arabic musical instruments}}\n{{Azerbaijani musical instruments}}\n{{Percussion}}\n\n[[Category:Drums]]\n[[Category:Battle drums]]\n[[Category:Unpitched percussion]]\n[[Category:Armenian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek culture]]\n[[Category:Assyrian culture]]\n[[Category:Greek musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern culture]]\n[[Category:Albanian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Turkish musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Arabic musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Azerbaijani musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Kurdish musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Serbian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Slovenian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Hungarian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Belarusian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Bosnian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Czech musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Romanian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Moldovan musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Turkmen musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Syrian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Persian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Macedonian musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Montenegrin musical instruments]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Instrument\n|color1=#FFD700\n|color2=#FFEC8B\n|name=Davul\n|names=Davul, Tapan, Tabl\n|image=Mehter davul.jpg\n|classification=[[Percussion instrument]] ([[membranophone]])\n|range= Rope tensioned\n}}\n\nThe '''davul''', '''tapan''', '''atabal''' or '''tabl''' is a large double-headed [[drum]] that is played with mallets.

Martinez, who'd been paroled after unrelated convictions for attempted murder and rape, lived in the area at the time of the deaths but left soon after, San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson said Wednesday. He moved to Spokane, Wash., and received life sentences there for several robberies and two rapes also in 1978. After 16 years in prison in 1994, he escaped and lived under an alias in California until 2014 when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He returned to Washington state and turned himself in to receive medical treatment in prison, Parkinson said. He died behind bars two months later. The homicide cases were reopened three years ago with the Department of Justice's Familiar DNA Search Team seeking a familial DNA match to the evidence. Authorities said it led them to a relative of Martinez and a former girlfriend who provided investigators the DNA sample from a razor he had used. A lab determined the DNA from the razor matched that from the crime scenes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/04/19/Police-DNA-match-identifies-killer-in-California-cold-cases/3741555685813/|title=Police: DNA match identifies killer in California cold cases|website=UPI|language=en|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/cold-case-dna-razor/index.html|title=DNA from old razor helped solve two cases of rape and murder from 40 years ago|last=Holcombe|first=Madeline|date=2019-04-19|website=CNN|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>\n*In May 2019, [[James Richard Curry]] was identified as the killer of [[Murder of Mary Silvani|Mary Silvani]], formerly known as \"Sheep Flats Jane Doe\"/\"Washoe County Jane Doe.\" DNA collected from Silvani's [[rape kit]] was uploaded to GEDMatch, leading to a tentative identification of the killer.

Martinez, who'd been paroled after unrelated convictions for attempted murder and rape, lived in the area at the time of the deaths but left soon after, San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson said Wednesday. He moved to Spokane, Wash., and received life sentences there for several robberies and two rapes also in 1978. After 16 years in prison in 1994, he escaped and lived under an alias in California until 2014 when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He returned to Washington state and turned himself in to receive medical treatment in prison, Parkinson said. He died behind bars two months later. The homicide cases were reopened three years ago with the Department of Justice's Familiar DNA Search Team seeking a familial DNA match to the evidence. Authorities said it led them to a relative of Martinez and a former girlfriend who provided investigators the DNA sample from a razor he had used.

He grabbed a bottle of Carew's gin<ref>Fitch, Noel Riley, \"Appetite for Life: The Biography of Julia Child\" (First Anchor Books Edition 1997), p. 106.</ref> before he parachuted out of the plane.<ref name=museum/> The [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] formed a [[United States Air Force Pararescue|search and rescue team]] to bring the group out from behind enemy lines. The operatives parachuted in, located the party, and evacuated them safely to [[India]], for which [[John Paton Davies Jr.]] later won the [[Medal of Freedom]].  Davies was a U.S. diplomat who, having been a passenger himself, initially led the group away from the crash site and out of harm's way before the rescuers arrived.<ref>Olson, Lynn and Cloud, Stanley W.

He had begun his own program, ''Eric Sevareid and the News'', on June 27, 1942, on CBS; it ran for five minutes, starting at 8:55<!---9 p.m.--> ([[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]) on Saturdays and Sundays.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"Eric Sevareid and the News\" Starts over WHP-CBS Tonight|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2962588/harrisburg_telegraph/|agency=Harrisburg Telegraph|date=June 27, 1942|page=25|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = August 6, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> In 1946, he reported on the founding of the [[UN]] and then penned [https://books.google.com/books?id=tcaHDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT549&lpg=PT549&dq=Sevareid+later+reported+on+++Yugoslav+Partisans.&source=bl&ots=2do2j9r68z&sig=ACfU3U1rFfw9MBRBR0pEEYupvVxBpVO6Sw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH8bWuo_DnAhUBrp4KHVbpAMMQ6AEwCHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=Sevareid%20later%20reported%20on%20%20%20Yugoslav%20Partisans.&f=false ''Not So Wild a Dream''] (University of Missouri Press, 1946). The book, whose title comes from part of the closing passage of [[Norman Corwin]]'s radio play \"On a Note of Triumph,\" appeared in eleven printings and became one of the primary sources on the lives of the generation of Americans who had lived through the Great Depression, only to confront the horrors of World War II. In the 1976 edition of the book, Sevareid wrote, \"It was a lucky stroke of timing to have been born and lived as an American in this last generation. It was good fortune to be a journalist in Washington, now the single news headquarters in the world since ancient Rome. But we are not Rome; the world is too big, too varied.\"<ref name=museum/>\n\nSevareid always considered himself a writer first and often felt uneasy behind a microphone and even less comfortable on television. Nonetheless, he worked extensively for CBS News on television for decades after the war. During the middle and the end of 1950s, Sevareid found himself on television as the host and science reporter of CBS's ''Conquest''. He also served as the head of the CBS Washington bureau from 1946 to 1954 and was one of the early critics of [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s anticommunism tactics.\n[[File:Richard M. Nixon's appearance on, \"A Conversation With the President\" - NARA - 194705.tif|thumb|right|250px|Sevareid interviewing President [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[White House]] for ''A Conversation With the President'' (1970)]]\n\n===Investigated by FBI===\nInternal [[FBI]] documents declassified in 1996 show that the agency took an active interest in Sevareid's reporting and activities in the 1940s and the early 1950s. A March 1953 document, \"Security Information\", is one of several to chronicle Sevareid's activities during the 1940s. It refers to unsubstantiated reports that Sevareid, while he was attending the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1941, was alleged to have associated with [[communist]]s. The files also alleged that while working for the school newspaper at the university, Sevareid participated in an active campaign against the [[ROTC]]. The files also noted his involvement in an awards banquet held by the [[Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee]], which had been designated a communist organization by [[Executive Order 9835]]. The files note a May 17, 1945 report in the ''Daily People's World'', which stated Sevareid was a scheduled speaker at the Committee's banquet. The FBI called the ''Daily People's World'' a [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] communist newspaper and claimed that Sevareid was identified as a radio commentator in its reports.\n\nOther information in the FBI files noted a May 19, 1945 \"newspapermen's forum,\" \"The Free Press,\" was held at the [[California Labor School]], and Sevareid participated. In two separate 1948 reports, Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]] called the California Labor School \"a subversive and Communist organization.\" The files included information that Sevareid's name was listed as one of those who was willing to raise funds to help support Hollywood celebrities appearing before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] in 1947. The information received by the FBI about Sevareid's purported Communist activity was provided by \"a representative of another governmental agency\" and was never confirmed by investigations.<ref name=fbi>[http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/sevareid_a.htm FBI files], Arnold Eric Sevareid.</ref>\n\nThe information contained in the bureau's files was circulated during March 1953 while Sevareid anchored a CBS news program, ''A Report to the Nation''. The FBI was specifically interested in his March 8<!--, 1953--> broadcast in which he interviewed [[Harold Stassen]], Director for the Mutual Security Agency. The FBI developed information that documented what they alleged was his \"disloyal\" activities.<ref name=fbi/>\n\nBy April 1953, the FBI documents show that the bureau found no reason to open a more extensive investigation into Sevareid's activities.<ref name=fbi/>\n\n===European correspondent===\nSevareid wound up the 1950s as CBS's roving European correspondent from 1959 to 1961. He contributed stories to ''[[CBS Reports]]'' during that time and served as moderator on a number of CBS series such as ''Town Meeting of the World'', ''The Great Challenge'', ''Where We Stand'', and ''Years of Crisis''. Sevareid also appeared in or on CBS coverage of every presidential election from 1948 to 1976, the year before his retirement.<ref name=museum/>\n\n===Final interview with Adlai Stevenson===\nOne of Sevareid's biggest scoops from this time period was his 1965 exclusive interview with [[Adlai Stevenson II]] shortly before Stevenson's death. The interview was not broadcast over CBS but instead appeared in ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine. However, it was Sevareid's familiar \"think-pieces,\" which familiarized him with viewers worldwide.<ref name=museum/>\n\n===''CBS Evening News'' appearances===\nOn November 22, 1963, Sevareid joined [[Walter Cronkite]] on CBS television with a commentary about the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] and the road ahead for the new president, [[Lyndon Johnson]]. From 1964 to his 1977 retirement from the network,<ref name=lmtsgnff/> Sevareid's two-minute segments on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' (anchored by Cronkite) inspired his admirers to dub him \"The&nbsp;Grey&nbsp;Eminence.\"\n\nDuring his long run as a commentator, his segments earned both [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] Awards. In 1987, he was honored as an inductee into the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences#Hall of fame|Academy's Fourth Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/hall-of-fame-honorees|title=Television Hall of Fame Honorees: Complete List}}</ref> Those who disagreed with his views nicknamed him \"Eric Severalsides.\" Sevareid recognized his own biases, which caused some to disagree with him vehemently. He said that as he had grown older, he had tended to become more conservative in foreign policy and liberal in domestic policy.<ref name=museum/>\n\nHis commentary touched on many of the day's important issues. After a 1966 trip to [[South Vietnam]], he commented that prolonging the war would be unwise and that the US would be better off pursuing a negotiated settlement. He also helped keep alive another Murrow tradition at CBS that began with the interview show ''[[Person to Person]]''. On ''Conversations with Eric Sevareid'', he interviewed such famous newsmakers as [[West German]] Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and novelist [[Leo Rosten]]. In somewhat of a spoof of that tradition, he also had a conversation with [[King George III]], portrayed by [[Peter Ustinov]], titled ''The Last King in America''.<ref name=museum/>\n\nSevareid later narrated the American history series ''Between The Wars''. In 1981, Sevareid hosted a documentary series on [[PBS]], entitled ''Enterprise'', a profile on how America portrays business. The following year, he hosted the syndicated newsmagazine program ''Eric Sevareid's Chronicle''. <ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0786215/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm Eric Sevareid, Biography] IMDb.com, Inc.</ref> \n\n==Personal life==\nSevareid married the former Lois Finger.

Later, Sevareid would refer fondly to the early years working with Murrow: \"We were like a young band of brothers in those early radio days with Murrow.\" In his final broadcast with CBS, in 1977, he would call Murrow the man who \"invented me.\"<ref name=museum>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/sevareideri/sevareideri.htm Sevareid, Eric], Museum of Broadcast Communications.</ref>\n\n===Rescue in Burma===\nOn August 2, 1943, Sevareid was on board a [[Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando]] that, having taken off from [[Assam]] in [[India]], developed engine trouble over [[Burma]] while it was on a [[The Hump|Hump airlift]] mission. He grabbed a bottle of Carew's gin<ref>Fitch, Noel Riley, \"Appetite for Life: The Biography of Julia Child\" (First Anchor Books Edition 1997), p. 106.</ref> before he parachuted out of the plane.<ref name=museum/> The [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] formed a [[United States Air Force Pararescue|search and rescue team]] to bring the group out from behind enemy lines. The operatives parachuted in, located the party, and evacuated them safely to [[India]], for which [[John Paton Davies Jr.]] later won the [[Medal of Freedom]].  Davies was a U.S. diplomat who, having been a passenger himself, initially led the group away from the crash site and out of harm's way before the rescuers arrived.<ref>Olson, Lynn and Cloud, Stanley W.

He had begun his own program, ''Eric Sevareid and the News'', on June 27, 1942, on CBS; it ran for five minutes, starting at 8:55<!---9 p.m.--> ([[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]) on Saturdays and Sundays.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"Eric Sevareid and the News\" Starts over WHP-CBS Tonight|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2962588/harrisburg_telegraph/|agency=Harrisburg Telegraph|date=June 27, 1942|page=25|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = August 6, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> In 1946, he reported on the founding of the [[UN]] and then penned [https://books.google.com/books?id=tcaHDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT549&lpg=PT549&dq=Sevareid+later+reported+on+++Yugoslav+Partisans.&source=bl&ots=2do2j9r68z&sig=ACfU3U1rFfw9MBRBR0pEEYupvVxBpVO6Sw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH8bWuo_DnAhUBrp4KHVbpAMMQ6AEwCHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=Sevareid%20later%20reported%20on%20%20%20Yugoslav%20Partisans.&f=false ''Not So Wild a Dream''] (University of Missouri Press, 1946). The book, whose title comes from part of the closing passage of [[Norman Corwin]]'s radio play \"On a Note of Triumph,\" appeared in eleven printings and became one of the primary sources on the lives of the generation of Americans who had lived through the Great Depression, only to confront the horrors of World War II. In the 1976 edition of the book, Sevareid wrote, \"It was a lucky stroke of timing to have been born and lived as an American in this last generation. It was good fortune to be a journalist in Washington, now the single news headquarters in the world since ancient Rome. But we are not Rome; the world is too big, too varied.\"<ref name=museum/>\n\nSevareid always considered himself a writer first and often felt uneasy behind a microphone and even less comfortable on television. Nonetheless, he worked extensively for CBS News on television for decades after the war. During the middle and the end of 1950s, Sevareid found himself on television as the host and science reporter of CBS's ''Conquest''. He also served as the head of the CBS Washington bureau from 1946 to 1954 and was one of the early critics of [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s anticommunism tactics.\n[[File:Richard M. Nixon's appearance on, \"A Conversation With the President\" - NARA - 194705.tif|thumb|right|250px|Sevareid interviewing President [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[White House]] for ''A Conversation With the President'' (1970)]]\n\n===Investigated by FBI===\nInternal [[FBI]] documents declassified in 1996 show that the agency took an active interest in Sevareid's reporting and activities in the 1940s and the early 1950s. A March 1953 document, \"Security Information\", is one of several to chronicle Sevareid's activities during the 1940s. It refers to unsubstantiated reports that Sevareid, while he was attending the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1941, was alleged to have associated with [[communist]]s. The files also alleged that while working for the school newspaper at the university, Sevareid participated in an active campaign against the [[ROTC]]. The files also noted his involvement in an awards banquet held by the [[Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee]], which had been designated a communist organization by [[Executive Order 9835]]. The files note a May 17, 1945 report in the ''Daily People's World'', which stated Sevareid was a scheduled speaker at the Committee's banquet. The FBI called the ''Daily People's World'' a [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] communist newspaper and claimed that Sevareid was identified as a radio commentator in its reports.\n\nOther information in the FBI files noted a May 19, 1945 \"newspapermen's forum,\" \"The Free Press,\" was held at the [[California Labor School]], and Sevareid participated. In two separate 1948 reports, Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]] called the California Labor School \"a subversive and Communist organization.\" The files included information that Sevareid's name was listed as one of those who was willing to raise funds to help support Hollywood celebrities appearing before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] in 1947. The information received by the FBI about Sevareid's purported Communist activity was provided by \"a representative of another governmental agency\" and was never confirmed by investigations.<ref name=fbi>[http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/sevareid_a.htm FBI files], Arnold Eric Sevareid.</ref>\n\nThe information contained in the bureau's files was circulated during March 1953 while Sevareid anchored a CBS news program, ''A Report to the Nation''. The FBI was specifically interested in his March 8<!--, 1953--> broadcast in which he interviewed [[Harold Stassen]], Director for the Mutual Security Agency. The FBI developed information that documented what they alleged was his \"disloyal\" activities.<ref name=fbi/>\n\nBy April 1953, the FBI documents show that the bureau found no reason to open a more extensive investigation into Sevareid's activities.<ref name=fbi/>\n\n===European correspondent===\nSevareid wound up the 1950s as CBS's roving European correspondent from 1959 to 1961. He contributed stories to ''[[CBS Reports]]'' during that time and served as moderator on a number of CBS series such as ''Town Meeting of the World'', ''The Great Challenge'', ''Where We Stand'', and ''Years of Crisis''. Sevareid also appeared in or on CBS coverage of every presidential election from 1948 to 1976, the year before his retirement.<ref name=museum/>\n\n===Final interview with Adlai Stevenson===\nOne of Sevareid's biggest scoops from this time period was his 1965 exclusive interview with [[Adlai Stevenson II]] shortly before Stevenson's death. The interview was not broadcast over CBS but instead appeared in ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine. However, it was Sevareid's familiar \"think-pieces,\" which familiarized him with viewers worldwide.<ref name=museum/>\n\n===''CBS Evening News'' appearances===\nOn November 22, 1963, Sevareid joined [[Walter Cronkite]] on CBS television with a commentary about the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] and the road ahead for the new president, [[Lyndon Johnson]]. From 1964 to his 1977 retirement from the network,<ref name=lmtsgnff/> Sevareid's two-minute segments on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' (anchored by Cronkite) inspired his admirers to dub him \"The&nbsp;Grey&nbsp;Eminence.\"\n\nDuring his long run as a commentator, his segments earned both [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] Awards. In 1987, he was honored as an inductee into the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences#Hall of fame|Academy's Fourth Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/hall-of-fame-honorees|title=Television Hall of Fame Honorees: Complete List}}</ref> Those who disagreed with his views nicknamed him \"Eric Severalsides.\" Sevareid recognized his own biases, which caused some to disagree with him vehemently. He said that as he had grown older, he had tended to become more conservative in foreign policy and liberal in domestic policy.<ref name=museum/>\n\nHis commentary touched on many of the day's important issues. After a 1966 trip to [[South Vietnam]], he commented that prolonging the war would be unwise and that the US would be better off pursuing a negotiated settlement. He also helped keep alive another Murrow tradition at CBS that began with the interview show ''[[Person to Person]]''. On ''Conversations with Eric Sevareid'', he interviewed such famous newsmakers as [[West German]] Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and novelist [[Leo Rosten]]. In somewhat of a spoof of that tradition, he also had a conversation with [[King George III]], portrayed by [[Peter Ustinov]], titled ''The Last King in America''.<ref name=museum/>\n\nSevareid later narrated the American history series ''Between The Wars''. In 1981, Sevareid hosted a documentary series on [[PBS]], entitled ''Enterprise'', a profile on how America portrays business. The following year, he hosted the syndicated newsmagazine program ''Eric Sevareid's Chronicle''. <ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0786215/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm Eric Sevareid, Biography] IMDb.com, Inc.</ref> \n\n==Personal life==\nSevareid married the former Lois Finger.
