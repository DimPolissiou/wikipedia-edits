He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998) and ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000). He is characterized as a spoiled, sadistic bully and is a frequent abuser of [[Sansa Stark]], to whom he becomes engaged in the first novel, and his uncle [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], whom he enjoys ridiculing.\n\nJoffrey is portrayed by Irish actor [[Jack Gleeson]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation, a role for which he has received significant critical attention and praise.<ref name=HBOCast>{{cite web | url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/joffrey-baratheon/bio/joffrey-baratheon.html |title=''Game of Thrones'' Cast and Crew: Joffrey Baratheon played by Jack Gleeson |publisher=[[HBO]] | accessdate=December 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/index.html|title=The Official Website for the HBO Series Game of Thrones - Season 4|work=HBO}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |title=From HBO |publisher= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307150640/http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |archivedate=2016-03-07 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nJoffrey Baratheon is not a [[Narration#Third-person|point of view]] character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as his uncle [[Tyrion Lannister]] and his one-time fianc\u00e9e [[Sansa Stark]]. He inherits his mother's traditional Lannister looks, and has blond hair and green eyes, and is believed by many to be very handsome.\n\n== Character description ==\nIn public, Joffrey is allegedly the oldest son and heir of King [[Robert Baratheon]] and Queen [[Cersei Lannister]], both of whom entered into a political marriage alliance after Robert took the throne by force from the \"Mad King\" Aerys II Targaryen.  In reality, his biological father is his mother's twin brother, [[Jaime Lannister]].  He has a younger sister, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]], and a younger brother, [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], both of whom are also products of Jaime and Cersei's [[incest]]uous relationship.  Their sole biological grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also first cousins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/guide/houses/jbaratheon/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nJoffrey is an amoral [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] who disguises his cruelty with a thin veneer of charm.  This is best epitomized by his response when his (then) betrothed offends him: Joffrey pronounces that his mother had taught him never to strike a woman, and so commissions a knight of the Kingsguard to hit her instead.  He enjoys forcing people to fight to the death, and enforces cruel punishments for lesser crimes.  He has no sense of personal responsibility, blaming failures on others.  He lacks self-control and often insults his allies and family members. He is noticeably unintelligent and impulsive, which frequently leads him to make irrational decisions. He appears to have virtually no interests other than sadism and extreme violence, paying no attention to actually governing his kingdom or to anything involving sex even when he is offered exceptionally beautiful women.\n\nJoffrey is 12 years old at the beginning of ''A Game of Thrones'' (1996).\n\n== Storylines ==\n[[File:A Song of Ice and Fire arms of Joffrey Baratheon scroll.png|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing a gold on red lion and a black on gold crowned stag combatant.|Joffrey Baratheon's personal coat of arms]]\n\n==== ''A Game of Thrones'' ====\n{{see also|A Game of Thrones}}\nPrince Joffrey is taken by his parents to Winterfell and is betrothed to [[Sansa Stark]] in order to create an alliance between House Baratheon and House Stark. At first, Joffrey is kind and polite to Sansa. However, he refuses to show sympathy with the family when [[Bran Stark]] falls from a tower, until physically forced to by his uncle, Tyrion Lannister. While on the Kingsroad to King's Landing, Joffrey and Sansa come across [[Arya Stark]] practicing swordplay with a commoner Mycah. Joffrey accuses Mycah of assaulting a noble girl and makes a cut on his face with a sword. This causes Arya to hit Joffrey, allowing Mycah to escape. When Joffrey then turns on Arya, her [[Dire wolf|direwolf]] Nymeria attacks Joffrey, injuring him. Later, Joffrey lies about the attack, saying it was unprovoked and demands Nymeria to be killed; however, Sansa's direwolf Lady is killed instead. He later has his bodyguard [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane]] hunt down and kill Mycah.\n\nLater, Eddard Stark discovers that Joffrey is not King Robert's biological son and refuses to acknowledge Joffrey's claim to the throne when [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]] dies. He is taken into custody. On Sansa's pleas, Eddard issues a false confession of his treason. Joffrey promised Sansa that he would be merciful but then beheads Eddard anyway and later forces Sansa to look upon her father's head.\n\n==== ''A Clash of Kings'' ====\n{{see also|A Clash of Kings}}\nJoffrey is briefly seen in ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998). He rules with whim and caprice, proving difficult for even his mother to control. Sansa becomes imprisoned to his will, and he frequently has his guards beat her when she displeases him. When [[Stannis Baratheon]] attacks King's Landing, Joffrey leaves the battlefield, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his uncle Tyrion's use of wildfire and his grandfather Tywin's last-minute counterattack aided by the forces of House Tyrell.\n\n==== ''A Storm of Swords'' ====\n{{see also|A Storm of Swords}}\nJoffrey sets aside his earlier betrothal to Sansa Stark in favor of Margaery Tyrell, cementing an alliance between the Lannisters and House Tyrell. At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, he humiliates his uncle and is outraged when his uncle threatens him after he commands him to consummate their marriage. Tyrion only avoids punishment when his father Tywin assures Joffrey that his uncle was drunk and had no intention of threatening the king. Later after the events of the \"Red Wedding\", Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother's head. His uncle Tyrion and his grandfather Tywin are outraged and the former threatens Joffrey once again. After another disagreement, Tywin sends Joffrey to his room, much to Joffrey's chagrin. During his wedding feast, he repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa, presenting an offensive play about \"The War of the Five Kings\", with each of the kings played by dwarves to humiliate his uncle, whom he also forces to act as his cupbearer. At the conclusion of the dinner, however, Joffrey dies from poisoned wine. Tyrion is falsely accused and arrested by Cersei in ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000) but it is later revealed that Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]] and Lord [[Petyr Baelish]] were the true perpetrators.\n\n==== Later novels ====\nJoffrey is mentioned a few times in the later novels.\n\n====Family tree====\n{{Family tree of Tytos Lannister}}\n\n==TV adaptation==\n\n==== Season 1 ====\nAfter Robert's death, the Lannisters make Joffrey King, and his mother uses him as a puppet. A cruel ruler, Joffrey makes a mistake when, against Cersei's and Sansa's wishes, he refuses to honor his promise to spare Ned Stark; instead, Joffrey has him executed.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\nJoffrey's act worsens the situation with the Lannisters' war effort, as his uncle Jaime is captured by the Starks, and Joffrey's paternal uncles Renly and Stannis challenge his claim to the Iron Throne. Joffrey frequently orders his Kingsguard to beat Sansa. His cruelty and ignorance of the commoners' suffering makes him unpopular after he orders the City Watch to kill all of his father's bastard children in King's Landing; consequently, he is almost killed during a riot. When Stannis attacks King's Landing, Joffrey serves only as a figurehead and avoids the heavy fighting. When the battle eventually turns in Stannis' favor, Cersei calls her son into the safety of the castle, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his uncle Tyrion and grandfather Tywin, aided by the forces of House Tyrell. To cement the alliance between those families, Joffrey's engagement to Sansa is annulled so he can marry Margaery Tyrell.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\nThe marriage is yet to take place, and rifts are growing between Joffrey, and his uncle Tyrion and grandfather Tywin, who are (in their respective ways) rebutting his cruelty. Joffrey also seems to take little interest in his betrothed, but is amazed and altered by her ways of winning the people's favor, in which he takes part. At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, he humiliates his uncle and is outraged when his uncle threatens him after Joffrey commands him to consummate the marriage. Tyrion only avoids punishment when his father Tywin assures Joffrey that Tyrion was drunk and had no intention of threatening the king. Later, after the events of the \"Red Wedding\", Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother Robb's head. Tyrion and Tywin are outraged, and the former threatens Joffrey once again. After another disagreement, Tywin sends Joffrey to his room, much to Joffrey's chagrin.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\nJoffrey finally marries Margaery. During his wedding feast, he repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa, presenting an offensive play about \"The War of the Five Kings\", with each of the kings played by dwarves to humiliate his uncle, whom he also forces to act as his cupbearer. At the height of the festivities, Joffrey is suddenly overcome by poison and dies. His last act is an attempt to point at Tyrion, and as a result Tyrion is falsely accused and ordered arrested by Cersei, but it is later revealed that Lady Olenna Tyrell and Lord Petyr Baelish were the true perpetrators. Olenna Tyrell, Margaery's grandmother, later confides to Margaery that she would never have let her marry \"that beast\". Following Joffrey's funeral, his younger brother and heir, Tommen, is crowned King and proceeds to marry Joffrey's widow Margaery.\n\n===Development and reception===\n\nIn January 2007, [[HBO]] secured the rights to adapt Martin's series for television.<ref name=\"Collider 2013\">{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/game-of-thrones-season-3-4-george-r-r-martin-interview/ |title=Producers David Benioff, Dan Weiss & George R.R.

The expansion of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara empire]] brought the Saurashtrians into [[South India]] in 14th century AD, since they were highly skilled manufacturers of fine [[silk]] [[garments]] and were patronized by the Kings and their families.<ref name=\":27\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Srikumaran|first=K.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGvXAAAAMAAJ&q=Saurashtra+Brahmins|title=Theerthayathra: A Pilgrimage Through Various Temples|date=2005|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|isbn=9788172763633|location=|pages=125\u2013126|language=en}}</ref> After the fall of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara empire]] they were welcomed by the [[Nayak dynasty|Nayak]] Kings of [[Thanjavur]] during mid 16th century AD<ref name=\":0\" /> and [[Madurai]] during 17th century AD and were allowed to settle near the [[Thirumalai Nayakkar Mahal|Thirumalai Nayakkar Palace.]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=T K|first=Ramesh|url=http://www.boloji.com/articles/759/the-unwritten-history-of-the-saurashtrians-of-south-india|title=The Unwritten History of the Saurashtrians of South India|date=|work=Boloji|access-date=2018-02-19|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":19\">{{Cite book|last=Randle|first=H.N|title=The Saurashtrians of South India|publisher=K.

During their migrations, the men were under the guidance of their leader and the process of migration tended to increase the power of kinship.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291970919|title=In search of Hegemony Comparative Case study of Brahmins of North And South India|last=Mitra|first=Debashish|date=|website=www.researchgate.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Thurston\">{{cite book|last=Thurston|first=Edgar|title=Castes and Tribes of Southern India, Volume VI of VII|publisher=Government Press|year=1909|location=Madras}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe people were divided into 5 heads -\n\n* '''''Goundans'' (Chiefs)''' -  the judges in both civil and criminal affairs.\n* '''''Soulins (Elders)''''' - They aided ''Goundans'' in deciding cases by a body of nobles called ''Soulins''.

The Saurashtrians classify their ancestors as originally belonging to the two lines of ''Thiriyarisham'' and ''Pancharisham'' descent groups. They follow ''[[Apastamba Dharmasutra]]'' and belong to the [[Ahobila Matha|Ahobila]] and [[Sankaracharya]] [[Matha|Mathas]].

After their settlement in [[South India|Southern India]], some of them, owing to the preachings of [[Adi Shankara|'''''Adi Sankaracharya''''']] and [[Ramanuja|'''''Ramanujacharya''''']], embraced '''''[[Shaivism]]''''' and '''''[[Vaishnavism]]''''' respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Gotras ===\n{{See also|Pravaras}}Saurashtrians, like all other [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin|Brahmins]], trace their paternal ancestors to one of the seven or eight sages, the [[Saptarshi|Saptarishis]].

The gotra was inherited from [[Guru]] at the time of [[Upanayana]], in ancient times, so it is a remnant of Guru-shishya tradition, but since the tradition is no longer followed, during Upanayana ceremony father acts as Guru of his son, so the son inherits his father's gotra.

According to one common tradition the layers of hell are:\n# A fire for sinners among the Muslims\n# Inferno interim for the sinner among the Christians\n# Provisional destination for sinners among the Jewish\n# The burning fire for renegades\n# A place for witches and fortunetellers\n# Furnace for the disbelievers\n# A bottomless abyss for hypocrites, like the Pharaoh and people who disbelieves after Isa's table or Muslims who are outwardly believers but inwardly infidels.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe seven layers of earth, refer to the different stages of the [[underworld]], the place of hell before the [[Day of Resurrection]]:\n# ''A dim'' (surface), inhabited by mankind and jinn.\n# ''Basit'' (plain), the prison of winds, from where the winds come from.\n# ''Thaqil'' (region of distress), the antechamber of hell, in which dwell men with the mouth of a dog, the ears of a goat and the cloven hoof of an ox.\n# ''Batih'' (place of torrents or swamps), a valley through which flows a stream of boiling sulphur to torment the wicked. The dweller in this valley have no eyes and in place of feet, have wings.\n# ''Hayn'' (region of adversity), in which serpents of enormous size devour the infidels.\n# ''Masika''/''[[Sijjin]]'' (store or dungeon), the office where sins are recorded and where souls are tormented by scorpions of the size of mules.\n# ''As-Saqar'' (place of burning) and ''Athara'' (place of damp and great cold) the home of [[Iblis]], who is chained in the midst of the [[Fallen angel#Islam|rebel angels]], his hand fastened one in front of and the other behind him, except when set free by God to chastise his demons.<ref>Miguel Asin Palacios Islam and the Divine Comedy Routledge 2013 ISBN \n978-1-134-53650-4 page 88-89</ref><ref>Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|9788120606722}} p. 102</ref>\n\n===Mystic concept of Jahannam===\nMuslim mystics, just like non-mystics, take ''Jahannam'' to be a place where sinners in this world will be punished, but they have provided various characterizations of the notion of the ''Jahannam''. Historically speaking, Sufi views develop from the fear of God to the love of God; they emphasize the interior of the [[sharia]] as well as its exterior. Sufism was finally developed into the theoretical mysticism which cultivated in the theories of ibn 'Arabi and his followers.\n\nAccording to [[Ibn Arabi|ibn 'Arabi]], the Hell and the Heaven refer, in fact, to distance from, and proximity to, God, respectively. The Hell which is home to wrong-doers is their conception of their distance from God, and the painful punishment and humility is that of distance. Such a distance is caused by one's indulgence in their natural desires and the illusion of things other than God as existent. But such a distance is only illusory, since everything is a form of the degrees of the Divine Existence, and thus, everything other than God is but illusion. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven are psychological states of the soul manifestated after its separation from the body.<ref>Rom Landau The Philosophy of Ibn 'Arabi Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-135-02969-2}}</ref> In later centuries, Sufis did not even find it acceptable for one to ask for the Heaven in the hope of meeting God or to do good in fear of hell.\n\n===Ahmadiyya concept of Jahannam===\nAccording to [[Ahmadiyya]] Islam, afterlife places are images of man's own spiritual life during lifetime, the fire a manifestation of his sins. The main purpose of ''Jahannam'' is therefore regarded to purge man from his evil deeds. Punishment therefore exists for perpetual spiritual advancement of human. Muslims and Non-Muslims both may enter or avoid hell depending on their deeds.<ref>[https://www.alislam.org/library/misc/a-philosophical-explanation-of-the-doctrine-of-hell/ alislam.org]</ref><ref>Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad ''Teachings of Islam: A discussion on the philosophy of spiritual development in Islam'' Ahmadiyya Anjuman Ishaat Islam Lahore USA 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-934-27117-9}}</ref>\n\n=== Hadith ===\n[[File:Muhammad and \"shameless women\" in Hell.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad]], [[Buraq]] and [[Gabriel]] observe \"[[Prostitutes|shameless women]]\" being punished in Hell for exposing their hair to the sight of strangers.]]\nHadith literature give expanded details and descriptions of ''Jahannam''.

According to one common tradition the layers of hell are:\n# A fire for sinners among the Muslims\n# Inferno interim for the sinner among the Christians\n# Provisional destination for sinners among the Jewish\n# The burning fire for renegades\n# A place for witches and fortunetellers\n# Furnace for the disbelievers\n# A bottomless abyss for hypocrites, like the Pharaoh and people who disbelieves after Isa's table or Muslims who are outwardly believers but inwardly infidels.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe seven layers of earth, refer to the different stages of the [[underworld]], the place of hell before the [[Day of Resurrection]]:\n# ''A dim'' (surface), inhabited by mankind and jinn.\n# ''Basit'' (plain), the prison of winds, from where the winds come from.\n# ''Thaqil'' (region of distress), the antechamber of hell, in which dwell men with the mouth of a dog, the ears of a goat and the cloven hoof of an ox.\n# ''Batih'' (place of torrents or swamps), a valley through which flows a stream of boiling sulphur to torment the wicked. The dweller in this valley have no eyes and in place of feet, have wings.\n# ''Hayn'' (region of adversity), in which serpents of enormous size devour the infidels.\n# ''Masika''/''[[Sijjin]]'' (store or dungeon), the office where sins are recorded and where souls are tormented by scorpions of the size of mules.\n# ''As-Saqar'' (place of burning) and ''Athara'' (place of damp and great cold) the home of [[Iblis]], who is chained in the midst of the [[Fallen angel#Islam|rebel angels]], his hand fastened one in front of and the other behind him, except when set free by God to chastise his demons.<ref>Miguel Asin Palacios Islam and the Divine Comedy Routledge 2013 ISBN \n978-1-134-53650-4 page 88-89</ref><ref>Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|9788120606722}} p. 102</ref>\n\n===Mystic concept of Jahannam===\nMuslim mystics, just like non-mystics, take ''Jahannam'' to be a place where sinners in this world will be punished, but they have provided various characterizations of the notion of the ''Jahannam''. Historically speaking, Sufi views develop from the fear of God to the love of God; they emphasize the interior of the [[sharia]] as well as its exterior. Sufism was finally developed into the theoretical mysticism which cultivated in the theories of ibn 'Arabi and his followers.\n\nAccording to [[Ibn Arabi|ibn 'Arabi]], the Hell and the Heaven refer, in fact, to distance from, and proximity to, God, respectively. The Hell which is home to wrong-doers is their conception of their distance from God, and the painful punishment and humility is that of distance. Such a distance is caused by one's indulgence in their natural desires and the illusion of things other than God as existent. But such a distance is only illusory, since everything is a form of the degrees of the Divine Existence, and thus, everything other than God is but illusion. According to ibn 'Arabi, the Hell and the Heaven are psychological states of the soul manifestated after its separation from the body.<ref>Rom Landau The Philosophy of Ibn 'Arabi Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-135-02969-2}}</ref> In later centuries, Sufis did not even find it acceptable for one to ask for the Heaven in the hope of meeting God or to do good in fear of hell.\n\n===Ahmadiyya concept of Jahannam===\nAccording to [[Ahmadiyya]] Islam, afterlife places are images of man's own spiritual life during lifetime, the fire a manifestation of his sins. The main purpose of ''Jahannam'' is therefore regarded to purge man from his evil deeds. Punishment therefore exists for perpetual spiritual advancement of human. Muslims and Non-Muslims both may enter or avoid hell depending on their deeds.<ref>[https://www.alislam.org/library/misc/a-philosophical-explanation-of-the-doctrine-of-hell/ alislam.org]</ref><ref>Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad ''Teachings of Islam: A discussion on the philosophy of spiritual development in Islam'' Ahmadiyya Anjuman Ishaat Islam Lahore USA 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-934-27117-9}}</ref>\n\n=== Hadith ===\n[[File:Muhammad and \"shameless women\" in Hell.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad]], [[Buraq]] and [[Gabriel]] observe \"[[Prostitutes|shameless women]]\" being punished in Hell for exposing their hair to the sight of strangers.]]\nHadith literature give expanded details and descriptions of ''Jahannam''.
