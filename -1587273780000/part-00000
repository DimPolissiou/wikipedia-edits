She advised both the First Lady and the mayor of [[New York City]], [[Fiorello LaGuardia]], on race relations.\n\nFauset was a member of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]]'s \"Black Cabinet\" that promoted civil rights for African Americans.  Despite her involvement with the Democratic Party, Fauset broke away after questioning the Party's inaction on furthering African American voters and civil rights. She became a member of the Republican National Committee's division on Negro Affairs in 1944 and endorsed Thomas E. Dewey, the Republican presidential candidate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGuire|first=John Thomas|date=2012-11-12|title=Working within the Labyrinth of Race|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0096144212465264|journal=Journal of Urban History|language=en-US|volume=39|issue=2|pages=172\u2013192|doi=10.1177/0096144212465264|issn=0096-1442}}</ref>\n\n=== Global Efforts ===\nFauset continued her work after [[World War II]] and turned her attention to more global issues.  In 1945, she helped found the United Nations Council in Philadelphia (later, the World Affairs Council) and remained an officer till 1950. She continued to volunteer for the organization years after. Fauset also attended the founding of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1950.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nDuring the 1950s she traveled extensively to Africa, India, and the Middle East. She befriended independence leaders and future presidents [[Kwame Nkrumah]] of Ghana and [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] of Nigeria, as well as [[Ralph Bunche]], an African American diplomat and 1950 Nobel Peace Prize winner. Beginning in 1955, Fauset lobbied for the opening of an Africa House in New York, a proposed forum for black and white Americans to learn about the continent by interacting with Africans.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Later Life ==\nIn 1955, Fauset was awarded a second Meritorious Service Medal from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. During her later years, Fauset lived in New York City. She died in her sleep while visiting Philadelphia on March 27, 1965.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSome of Fauset's surviving papers and photos are housed in an archive collection at Howard University. Her influential accomplishments for African American people earned her a Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission Marker. It was unveiled in 1991 and can be found outside her old home on 5402 Vine Street in Philadelphia. The memorial reads \"The first Black woman elected to a state legislature in the U.S., Fauset, who lived here, won her seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, 1938. She later served as a Civil Defense race relations advisor under Franklin D. Roosevelt.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-340|title=Crystal Bird Fauset Historical Marker|last=|first=|date=|website=explorepahistory.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref> \n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fauset, Crystal Bird}}\n[[Category:1894 births]]\n[[Category:1965 deaths]]\n[[Category:African-American state legislators in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:African-American women in politics]]\n[[Category:Women state legislators in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:People from Princess Anne, Maryland]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:Teachers College, Columbia University alumni]]\n[[Category:Swarthmore College people]]\n[[Category:Members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:Pennsylvania Republicans]]\n[[Category:Pennsylvania Democrats]]\n[[Category:20th-century American politicians]]\n[[Category:Boston State College alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century American women politicians]]\n", "name_user": "Cjung10", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Bird_Fauset"}

During her time with Manson's group, she was known by various aliases such as '''Louella Alexandria''',  '''Leslie Marie Sankston''', '''Linda Sue Owens''', and '''Lulu'''. Van Houten was arrested and charged in relation to the 1969 killings of [[Leno and Rosemary LaBianca]]. She was convicted and sentenced to death. The California Supreme Court decision on ''[[People v. Anderson]]'' then ruled in 1972 that the death penalty was unconstitutional, resulting in her sentence being commuted to life in prison. Her conviction was then overturned in a 1976 appellate court decision which granted her a retrial. Her second trial ended with a [[Hung jury|deadlocked jury]] and a mistrial. At her third trial in 1978, she was convicted of two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy and sentenced to seven years to life in prison.<ref name=\"LA times\" />  In relation to her case, high courts, parole boards, and the state governor have said that an inexplicable or racial motive for murder could merit exemplary punishment and outweigh any evidence of subsequent reform.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Early life==\nVan Houten was born on August 23, 1949, in the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[Altadena, California|Altadena]]. She grew up in a [[middle-class]] churchgoing family along with an older brother and two adopted siblings, a brother and a sister, who were Korean.  Her  mother and father divorced when she was 14.  She began taking [[LSD]], [[Benzedrine]], and smoking [[hashish]] around age 15, running away for a time but returning to complete high school. At 17, she became pregnant and was forced by her mother to undergo an abortion. Van Houten's mother informed her sometime later that the procedure could not be referred to as an abortion as the fetus was too mature. She instructed the girl to bury the late term aborted baby in their backyard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/leslie-van-houten-ex-manson-follower-approved-parole-n799431|title=Leslie Van Houten, Ex-Manson Follower, Approved for Parole|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=[[NBC News]]|publisher=[[NBCUniversal]]|location=New York City|date=September 7, 2017}}</ref> Van Houten stated that after this event, she felt very removed from her mother and harbored intense anger toward her.

Eventually, the group stopped in a house in [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]], the home of Rosemary and Leno LaBianca.  [[Leno and Rosemary LaBianca]]'s home was next to a house rented by a long-time close friend of Manson's original music industry contact, [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]].

Rosemary started struggling; meanwhile, her husband, who had been tied up in the living room, started screaming as Watson began stabbing him. Rosemary grabbed the lamp and swung it at Van Houten, who fought with her and knocked the lamp away. Van Houten then held Rosemary LaBianca down while Krenwinkel tried to stab her in the chest, but the blade bent on LaBianca's [[clavicle]]. Van Houten called for assistance from Watson, who entered the bedroom and stabbed Rosemary LaBianca several times. He then found Van Houten, handed her the knife, and told her to \"do something\" (since Manson had instructed Watson to make sure everyone actively participated). Van Houten stabbed Rosemary's lower back and buttocks over a dozen times. Van Houten later told Dianne Lake that she had stabbed someone who was already dead.

Using the Manson family nicknames during interviews with police, Van Houten helped identify who had actively participated in the Tate and LaBianca murders, and who had been there but not killed anyone, thereby indicating that Kasabian was a crucial witness.

During the sentencing phase of the trial, in an apparent attempt to exonerate Manson, Van Houten testified that she had committed a killing in which she was not, in fact, involved. She told a psychiatrist of beating her adopted sister, leading him to characterize her as \"a spoiled little princess\" and a \"psychologically loaded gun\", and was adamant that Manson had no influence over her thought processes or behavior. Van Houten also told the psychiatrist that she would have gone to jail for manslaughter or assault with a deadly weapon without ever meeting Manson. When her lawyer, attempting to show she felt remorse, asked if she felt sorrow or shame for the death of Rosemary LaBianca, Van Houten replied \"sorry is only a five-letter word\" and \"you can't undo something that is done\". In cross-examination, Van Houten aggressively implicated herself in inflicting wounds while the victim was living, and severely wounding the victim, severing her spine, which might have been fatal by itself. She vehemently denied acting on instructions from Manson, and said a court-appointed attorney who \"had a lot of different ideas on how to get me off\" had told her to claim Manson ordered the killings.<ref name=\"Bugliosi 1974\"/>\n\nVan Houten was sentenced to be executed; she was the youngest woman ever condemned to death in California.

They were initially kept separate from the prison population, because they were viewed as a threat to the other inmates. \n\nIn the early 1970s, Van Houten, Atkins and Krenwinkel worked with a social worker, [[Karlene Faith]], who sought to help them re-establish their identities separate from the [[Manson Family]].<ref>Jeffrey Melnick, \"Keeping Faith With the Manson Women,\" ''The New Yorker'', Aug. 1, 2018.</ref>  Faith later wrote a book about her work with the women, ''The Long Prison Journey of Leslie Van Houten''. In the book, Faith tells how two of the women believed that they would \"grow wings and become fairies\" after the expected race war had occurred.  The women told Faith that they obtained this belief from Manson. Faith viewed all three of the Manson women as victims, and lobbied for their early release from prison.<ref>Karlene Faith, ''The Long Prison Journey of Leslie Van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult'' (Northeastern University Press, 2001) [http://www.upne.com/1-55553-481-3.html]</ref>  \n\nFaith's work with the Manson women was later portrayed in the feature film, ''[[Charlie Says (2018 film)|Charlie Says]]''.\n\nVan Houten was also befriended by film director, [[John Waters]].

Van Houten was arrested and charged in relation to the 1969 killings of [[Leno and Rosemary LaBianca]]. She was convicted and sentenced to death. The California Supreme Court decision on ''[[People v. Anderson]]'' then ruled in 1972 that the death penalty was unconstitutional, resulting in her sentence being commuted to life in prison. Her conviction was then overturned in a 1976 appellate court decision which granted her a retrial. Her second trial ended with a [[Hung jury|deadlocked jury]] and a mistrial. At her third trial in 1978, she was convicted of two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy and sentenced to seven years to life in prison.<ref name=\"LA times\" />  In relation to her case, high courts, parole boards, and the state governor have said that an inexplicable or racial motive for murder could merit exemplary punishment and outweigh any evidence of subsequent reform.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Early life==\nVan Houten was born on August 23, 1949, in the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[Altadena, California|Altadena]].

During the sentencing phase of the trial, in an apparent attempt to exonerate Manson, Van Houten testified that she had committed a killing in which she was not, in fact, involved. She told a psychiatrist of beating her adopted sister, leading him to characterize her as \"a spoiled little princess\" and a \"psychologically loaded gun\", and was adamant that Manson had no influence over her thought processes or behavior. Van Houten also told the psychiatrist that she would have gone to jail for manslaughter or assault with a deadly weapon without ever meeting Manson. When her lawyer, attempting to show she felt remorse, asked if she felt sorrow or shame for the death of Rosemary LaBianca, Van Houten replied \"sorry is only a five-letter word\" and \"you can't undo something that is done\". In cross-examination, Van Houten aggressively implicated herself in inflicting wounds while the victim was living, and severely wounding the victim, severing her spine, which might have been fatal by itself. She vehemently denied acting on instructions from Manson, and said a court-appointed attorney who \"had a lot of different ideas on how to get me off\" had told her to claim Manson ordered the killings.<ref name=\"Bugliosi 1974\"/>\n\nVan Houten was sentenced to be executed; she was the youngest woman ever condemned to death in California.

In the book, Faith tells how two of the women believed that they would \"grow wings and become fairies\" after the expected race war had occurred.

San Francisco-based actress [[Connie Champagne]] portrayed Van Houten in Dude Theater's long-running 1989 stage play ''The Charlie Manson Story'', first at Climate Theater & then Theatre Artaud, a black comedy directed by Christopher Brophy. The production was the first to de-glamorourize the Manson-myth and to question Manson's belief in the so-called \"Helter Skelter.\"  \nThe 2009 film ''[[Leslie, My Name Is Evil]]'' (released in some countries under the titles ''Manson Girl'' and ''Manson, My Name Is Evil'') is partially based on Van Houten's early life and stars actress [[Kristen Hager]] as Van Houten. In ''[[Helter Skelter (2004 film)|Helter Skelter]]''  (2004 remake of the 1976 film) Van Houten was portrayed by actress Catherine Wadkins. A year earlier, in 2003, Amy Yates portrayed Leslie Van Houten in the film ''[[The Manson Family (film)|The Manson Family]]''. In the 2015 NBC fictional series ''[[Aquarius (U.S. TV series)|Aquarius]]'', which centers on the Los Angeles Police Department and the Manson murders, [[Emma Dumont]] portrays a character named \"Emma\" who is loosely based on Van Houten. [[Tania Raymonde]] portrayed Van Houten in Susanna Lo's 2016 film ''[[Manson Girls]]''. Later in 2016, [[Greer Grammer]] portrayed Van Houten in Leslie Libman's film ''Manson's Lost Girls'', which starred [[MacKenzie Mauzy]] as Kasabian. In 2018 she was portrayed by Gabrielle Klobucar in the made for TV documentary ''Inside the Manson Cult: The Lost Tapes.''Also in 2018, Hannah Murray played Van Houten in the feature movie ''[[Charlie Says (2018 film)|Charlie Says]]''.

He was noted for his unique style and his eccentric, ultimately self-destructive behaviour.\n\nMoon grew up in [[Alperton]], a suburb of [[Wembley]], in [[Middlesex]], and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After playing with a local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they recorded their first single. He remained with the band during their rise to fame, and was quickly recognised for his drumming style, which emphasised [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]], cymbal crashes, and [[Fill (music)|drum fills]]. Throughout Moon's tenure with the Who his drum kit steadily grew in size, and (along with [[Ginger Baker]]) he has been credited as one of the earliest rock drummers to regularly employ [[Double bass drumming|double bass drums]] in his setup. Moon occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation, and remained a member of the band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, however, Moon developed a reputation for [[Instrument destruction|smashing his kit]] on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated by blowing up toilets with [[cherry bomb]]s or [[dynamite]], and by destroying television sets. Moon enjoyed touring and socialising, and became bored and restless when the Who were inactive. His 21st birthday party in [[Flint, Michigan]], has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups.\n\nMoon suffered a number of setbacks during the 1970s, most notably the accidental death of chauffeur Neil Boland and the breakdown of his marriage. He became [[Alcohol abuse|addicted to alcohol]], particularly brandy and champagne, and acquired a reputation for decadence and dark humour; his nickname was \"Moon the Loon\". After moving to Los Angeles with personal assistant [[Dougal Butler|Peter \"Dougal\" Butler]] during the mid-1970s, Moon recorded his only solo album, the poorly received ''[[Two Sides of the Moon]]''. While touring with the Who, on several occasions he passed out on stage and was hospitalised. By the time of their final tour with him in 1976, and particularly during production of ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]'' and ''[[Who Are You]]'', the drummer's deterioration was evident. Moon moved back to London in 1978, dying in September of that year from an overdose of [[Clomethiazole|Heminevrin]], a drug intended to treat or prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.\n\nMoon's drumming continues to be praised by critics and musicians. He was posthumously inducted into the ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' Hall of Fame in 1982, becoming only the second rock drummer to be chosen, and in 2011, Moon was voted the second-greatest drummer in history by a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' readers' poll.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moderndrummer.com/modern-drummers-readers-poll-archive/#_ |title=Modern Drummer\u2019s Readers Poll Archive, 1979\u20132014 |work=[[Modern Drummer]] |accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"rsmoon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/rolling-stone-readers-pick-best-drummers-of-all-time-20110208/2-keith-moon-0397214 |title=Rolling Stone Readers Pick Best Drummers of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Central Middlesex Hospital, Clock Tower entrance - geograph.org.uk - 16176.jpg|alt=Central Middlesex Hospital|thumb|[[Central Middlesex Hospital]], Moon's place of birth]]\n\nKeith John Moon was born to Alfred Charles (Alf) and Kathleen Winifred (Kit) Moon{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=1}}{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=13}} on 23 August 1946 at [[Central Middlesex Hospital]] in northwest London, and grew up in Wembley. He was [[Hyperactivity|hyperactive]] as a boy, with a restless imagination and a particular fondness for ''[[The Goon Show]]'' and music. Moon attended [[Alperton Community School|Alperton Secondary Modern School]] after failing his [[eleven plus exam]], which precluded his attending a [[grammar school]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=9,11}} His art teacher said in a report: \"Retarded artistically. Idiotic in other respects\". His music teacher wrote that Moon \"has great ability, but must guard against a tendency to show off.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=15}}\n\nMoon joined his local [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]] band at the age of twelve on the [[bugle]], but found the instrument too difficult to learn and decided to take up drums instead.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=17}} He was interested in practical jokes and home science kits, with a particular fondness for explosions.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=20}} On his way home from school, Moon would often go to Macari's Music Studio on Ealing Road to practise on the drums there, learning his basic skills on the instrument. He left school at age fourteen, around Easter in 1961.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=22}} Moon then enrolled at Harrow Technical College; this led to a job as a radio repairman, enabling him to buy his first drum kit.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=29}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nMoon took lessons from one of the loudest contemporary drummers, [[Screaming Lord Sutch]]'s [[Carlo Little]], at 10 [[shilling]]s per lesson.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1496340/Carlo-Little.html\n|title=Obituaries: Carlo Little |accessdate=30 August 2013 |date=17 August 2005 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> Moon's early style was influenced by [[jazz]], American [[surf music]] and [[rhythm and blues]], exemplified by noted Los Angeles studio drummer [[Hal Blaine]]. His favourite musicians were jazz artists, particularly [[Gene Krupa]] (whose flamboyant style he subsequently copied).{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=237}} Moon also admired [[Elvis Presley]]'s original drummer [[DJ Fontana]], [[the Shadows]]' original drummer [[Tony Meehan]]{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=11}} and [[the Pretty Things]]' [[Viv Prince]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=100}} He also enjoyed singing, with a particular interest in [[Motown]].<ref name=\"amazingjourney\">{{cite video |title=Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who |publisher=Universal Pictures Video |asin=B000WBP282 |date=26 November 2007}}</ref> Moon idolised [[the Beach Boys]];{{sfn|Bogovich|Posner|2003|page=24}} [[Roger Daltrey]] later said that given the opportunity, Moon would have left to play for the California band even at the peak of the Who's fame.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/50277/roger-daltrey-keith-moon-wouldve-left-the-who-for-the-beach-boys |title=Roger Daltrey: 'Keith Moon Would've Left The Who for The Beach Boys' |last1=Colothan |first1=Scott |date=2 April 2009 |website=Gigwise |accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time Moon joined his first serious band: the Escorts, replacing his best friend Gerry Evans.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=38}} In December 1962 he joined the Beachcombers, a semi-professional London [[cover band]] playing hits by groups such as the Shadows.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=46}} During his time in the group Moon incorporated theatrical tricks into his act, including \"shooting\" the group's lead singer with a starter pistol.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=48\u201366}} The Beachcombers all had day jobs; Moon, who worked in the sales department at [[British Gypsum]], had the keenest interest in turning professional. In April 1964, aged 17,{{sfn|Case|2010|p=146}} he auditioned for the Who as a replacement for [[Doug Sandom]]. The Beachcombers continued as a local cover band after his departure.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=71\u201375}}\n\n===The Who===\n{{main|The Who}}\n[[File:Keith Moon 1967.jpg|alt=Unsmiling young man in a T-shirt, holding a bottle|thumb|upright|Moon backstage in [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany, 1967]]\n\nA commonly cited story of how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed [[Red hair|ginger]] (future bandmate [[Pete Townshend]] later described him as a \"ginger vision\"),<ref name=\"stein\">{{cite AV media |people=The Who |title=The Kids Are Alright |medium=movie |publisher=Jeff Stein, Sydney Rose |location=England |year=1979 |url=http://www.thewho.net/linernotes/TKAA.html}}</ref>{{rp|52:40}} he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; he played in the set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process.{{sfn|Chapman|1998|p=70}} In the words of the drummer, \"they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Rockin' in Time |last=Szatmary |first=David P. |publisher=Pearson |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-205-93624-3 |location=United States |pages=129}}</ref> Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had \"just been filling in for the last fifteen years.\"<ref name=\"stein\"/>{{rp|52:29}}\n\nMoon's arrival in the Who changed the dynamics of the group. Sandom had generally been the peacemaker as Daltrey and Townshend feuded between themselves, but because of Moon's temperament the group now had four members frequently in conflict. \"We used to fight regularly\", remembered Moon in later years. \"[[John Entwistle|John [Entwistle]]] and I used to have fights&nbsp;\u2013 it wasn't very serious, it was more of an emotional spur-of-the moment thing.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=87}} Moon also clashed with Daltrey and Townshend: \"We really have absolutely nothing in common apart from music\", he said in a later interview.<ref>{{cite book |title=Roger Daltrey: The biography |page=28 |first=Tim |last=Ewbank |first2=Stafford |last2=Hildred |publisher=Hachette UK |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4055-1845-1}}</ref> Although Townshend described him as a \"completely different person to anyone I've ever met\",<ref name=\"stein\"/>{{rp|38:48}} the pair had a rapport in the early years and enjoyed practical jokes and improvised comedy. Moon's drumming style affected the band's musical structure; although Entwistle initially found Moon's lack of conventional timekeeping problematic, it created an original sound.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=87}}\n\nMoon was particularly fond of touring, since it was his only chance to regularly socialise with his bandmates, and was generally restless and bored when not playing live. This later carried over to other aspects of his life, as he acted them out (according to journalist and Who biographer [[Dave Marsh]]) \"as if his life were one long tour.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=354}} These antics earned him the nickname \"Moon the Loon\".{{sfn|Case|2010|p=145}}\n\n====Musical contributions====\n{{quote box|align=right|width=35em|quote=I suppose as a drummer, I'm adequate.

That's why he had two sets of tom-toms.

Moon's contribution.\"{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=35}} Contemporary critics questioned his ability to keep time, with biographer [[Tony Fletcher]] suggesting that the timing on ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'' was \"all over the place.\" Who producer Jon Astley said, \"You didn't think he was keeping time, but he was.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=234}} Early recordings of Moon's drumming sound tinny and disorganised;<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Who's Next (2003 remaster) |author=John Atkins |page=23 |publisher=Polydor |id=113 056-2}}</ref> it was not until the recording of ''[[Who's Next]]'', with [[Glyn Johns]]' no-nonsense production techniques and the need to keep time to a synthesizer track, that he began developing more discipline in the studio. Fletcher considers the drumming on this album to be the best of Moon's career.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=286}}\n\nUnlike contemporary rock drummers such as [[Ginger Baker]] and [[John Bonham]], Moon hated drum solos and refused to play them in concert. At a [[Madison Square Garden]] show on [[The Who Tour 1974|10 June 1974]], Townshend and Entwistle decided to spontaneously stop playing during \"[[Waspman]]\" to listen to Moon's drum solo. Moon continued briefly and then stopped, shouting \"Drum solos are boring!\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=329}} On 23 June 1977, he made a guest appearance at a [[Led Zeppelin]] concert in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/keith-moon-led-zeppelin/ |title=The Day Keith Moon Joined Led Zeppelin Onstage |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Keith-Moon Bellboy.jpg|alt=Keith Moon singing|thumb|left|Moon singing at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], Toronto, 21 October 1976;{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=466}} he enjoyed singing whenever possible.]]\n\nMoon also aspired to sing lead vocal on some songs.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=183}} While the other three members handled most of the onstage vocals, Moon would attempt to sing backup (particularly on \"[[I Can't Explain]]\").

After the pair socialised for a few days, Moon and Entwistle brought Johnston to the set of ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'',{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=159}} which made them late for a show with the Who that evening. During the finale of \"[[My Generation]]\", an altercation broke out on stage between Moon and Townshend which was reported on the front page of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' the following week. Moon and Entwistle left the Who for a week (with Moon hoping to join [[the Animals]] or [[the Nashville Teens]]), but they changed their minds and returned.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=156\u2013160}}\n\nOn the Who's early US package tour at the RKO 58th Street Theatre in New York in March and April 1967, Moon performed two or three shows a day, kicking over his drum kit after every show.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|pp=241, 247}} Later that year, during their appearance on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', he bribed a stagehand to load [[gunpowder]] into one of his bass drums; the stagehand used about ten times the standard amount.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=275}} During the finale of \"My Generation\", he kicked the drum off the riser and set off the charge. The intensity of the explosion singed Townshend's hair and embedded a piece of cymbal in Moon's arm.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=276}} A clip of the incident became the opening scene for the film ''The Kids Are Alright''.<ref name=\"stein\"/>{{rp|7:44}}\n\nAlthough Moon was known for kicking over his drum kit, Haynes claimed that it was done carefully and the kit rarely needed repairs.

When he briefly considered leaving the Who in 1966, he spoke with Entwistle and Page about forming a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]. Moon (or Entwistle) remarked that a particular suggestion had gone down like a \"lead [[zeppelin]]\" (a play on \"lead balloon\"). Although that supergroup was never formed, Page remembered the phrase and later adapted it as the name of his new band.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=225}}<!--Since it's only speculation that Moon used the phrase (it could just as easily have been Entwistle), I don't think this paragraph belongs in this article.-->\n\n[[The Beatles]] became friends with Moon, and this led to occasional collaborations.

[[Track Records]]-MCA released a Moon solo single in 1974, comprising cover versions of [[the Beach Boys]]' \"[[Don't Worry, Baby]]\" and \"Teenage Idol\". The following year he released his only solo album, entitled ''[[Two Sides of the Moon]]''. Although it featured Moon on vocals, he played drums on only three tracks; most of the drumming was left to others (including [[Ringo Starr]], [[session musician]]s Curly Smith and [[Jim Keltner]], and actor-musician [[Miguel Ferrer]]).{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=402\u2013406}} The album was received poorly by critics.

They remembered his dream of getting out of music and becoming a Hollywood film actor,<ref name=\"amazingjourney\"/>{{better source|date=October 2013}} although Daltrey did not think Moon had the patience and work ethic required by a professional actor. Who manager Bill Curbishley agreed that Moon \"wasn't disciplined enough to actually turn up or commit to doing the stuff.\"{{sfn|Chapman|1998|p=80}}\n\nNevertheless, the drummer landed several acting roles. His first was in 1971, a [[Cameo role|cameo]] in [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[200 Motels]]'' as a nun afraid of dying from a drug overdose. Although it only took 13 days to film, fellow cast member [[Howard Kaylan]] remembers Moon spending off-camera time at the Kensington Garden Hotel bar instead of sleeping.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=280}} Moon's next film role was J.D.

During the Who's early days he began taking [[amphetamines]],{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=165}} and in a ''NME'' interview said his favourite food was \"[[Dexamyl|French Blues]]\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=178}} He spent his share of the band's income quickly, and was a regular at London clubs such as the [[Speakeasy Club|Speakeasy]] and [[The Bag O'Nails]]; the combination of pills and alcohol escalated into alcoholism and drug addiction later in his life.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=224}} \"[We] went through the same stages everybody goes through&nbsp;\u2013 the bloody drug corridor\", he later reflected. \"Drinking suited the group a lot better.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=262}}\n\nAccording to Townshend, Moon began destroying hotel rooms when the Who stayed at the [[Berlin]] Hilton on tour in late 1966.{{sfn|Townshend|2012|p=94}} In addition to hotel rooms, Moon destroyed friends' homes and even his own, throwing furniture from upper-storey windows and lighting fires. Andrew Neill and Matthew Kent estimated that his destruction of hotel toilets and plumbing cost as much as \u00a3300,000 ($500,000).{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|page=265}} These acts, often fuelled by drugs and alcohol, were Moon's way of demonstrating his eccentricity; he enjoyed shocking the public with them. Longtime friend and personal assistant Butler observed, \"He was trying to make people laugh and be Mr Funny, he wanted people to love him and enjoy him, but he would go so far.

I'd been used to penny bangers before.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=194}} He quickly developed a reputation for destroying bathrooms and blowing up toilets. The destruction mesmerised him, and enhanced his public image as rock's premier hell-raiser. Tony Fletcher wrote that \"no toilet in a hotel or changing room was safe\" until Moon had exhausted his supply of explosives.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=194}}\n\nPete Townshend walked into the bathroom of Moon's hotel room and noticed the toilet had disappeared, with only the S-bend remaining. The drummer explained that since a cherry bomb was about to explode, he had thrown it down the loo and showed Townshend the case of cherry bombs. \"And of course from that moment on,\" the guitarist remembered, \"we got thrown out of every hotel we ever stayed in.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=270}}\n\nEntwistle recalled being close to Moon on tour: \"I suppose we were two of a kind\"...&nbsp;We shared a room on the road and got up to no good.\"<ref name=\"jones\"/> Consequently, both were often involved in blowing up toilets.

The Who spent the afternoon visiting local radio stations with Nancy Lewis (then the band's publicist), and Moon posed for a photo outside the hotel in front of a \"Happy Birthday Keith\" sign put up by the hotel management. According to Lewis, Moon was drunk by the time the band went onstage at [[Atwood Stadium]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=196}}\n\nReturning to the hotel, Moon started a food fight and soon cake began flying through the air. The drummer knocked out part of his front tooth; at the hospital, doctors could not give him an anaesthetic (due to his inebriation) before removing the remainder of the tooth. Back at the hotel a m\u00eal\u00e9e erupted; fire extinguishers were set off, guests (and objects) thrown into the swimming pool and a piano reportedly destroyed. The chaos ended only when police arrived with guns drawn.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=196}}\n\nA furious Holiday Inn management presented the groups with a bill for $24,000, which was reportedly settled by Herman's Hermits tour manager Edd McCann.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=196\u20137}} Townshend claimed that the Who were banned for life from all of the hotel's properties,{{sfn|Townshend|2012|p=37}} but Fletcher wrote that they stayed at a Holiday Inn in [[Rochester, New York]] a week later.

During the 1973 [[Quadrophenia]] tour, at the Who's debut US date at the [[Cow Palace]] in [[Daly City, California]], Moon ingested a mixture of [[tranquilliser]]s and [[brandy]]. During the concert, Moon passed out on his drum kit during \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]].\" The band stopped playing, and a group of [[road crew|roadies]] carried Moon offstage. They gave him a shower and an injection of [[cortisone]], sending him back onstage after a thirty-minute delay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/roger-daltrey-interview-2018|title=Roger Daltrey: 'Keith Moon lived his entire life as a fantasy'|first=Dylan|last=Jones|website=British GQ}}</ref> Moon passed out again during \"[[Magic Bus (song)|Magic Bus]],\" and was again removed from the stage. The band continued without him for several songs before Townshend asked, \"Can anyone play the drums? \u2013 I mean somebody good?\" A drummer in the audience, [[Scot Halpin]], came up and played the rest of the show.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=361\u2013362}}\n\nDuring the opening date of the band's March 1976 US tour at the [[Boston Garden]], Moon passed out over his drum kit after two numbers and the show was rescheduled. The next evening Moon systematically destroyed everything in his hotel room, cut himself doing so and passed out. He was discovered by manager Bill Curbishley, who took him to a hospital, telling him \"I'm gonna get the doctor to get you nice and fit, so you're back within two days. Because I want to break your fucking jaw&nbsp;... You have fucked this band around so many times and I'm not having it any more.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=475}} Doctors told Curbishley that if he had not intervened, Moon would have bled to death.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=457}} Marsh suggested that at this point Daltrey and Entwistle seriously considered firing Moon, but decided that doing so would make his life worse.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=476}}\n\nEntwistle has said that Moon and the Who reached their live peak in 1975\u201376.  At the end of the 1976 US tour in Miami that August, the drummer, delirious, was treated in Hollywood Memorial Hospital for eight days. The group was concerned that he would be unable to complete the last leg of the tour, which ended at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto on 21 October (Moon's last public show).{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=464\u2013466}}  During the band's recording sabbatical between 1976 and 1978, Moon gained a considerable amount of weight.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=492}}  By the time of the Who's invitation-only show at the [[Gaumont State Cinema]] on 15 December 1977 for ''The Kids are Alright'', Moon was visibly overweight and had difficulty sustaining a solid performance.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=494}} After recording ''[[Who Are You]]'', Townshend refused to follow the album with a tour unless Moon stopped drinking,{{sfn|Townshend|2012|p=264}} and said that if Moon's playing did not improve he would be fired.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=496}} Daltrey later denied threatening to fire him, but said that by this time the drummer was out of control.{{sfn|Chapman|1998|p=84}}\n\n===Financial problems===\nBecause the Who's early stage act relied on smashing instruments, and owing to Moon's enthusiasm for damaging hotels, the group were in debt for much of the 1960s; Entwistle estimated they lost about \u00a3150,000.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=304}} Even when the group became relatively financially stable after ''Tommy'', Moon continued to rack up debts. He bought a number of cars and gadgets, and flirted with bankruptcy.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=354}} Moon's recklessness with money reduced his profit from the group's 1975 UK tour to \u00a347.35 ({{Inflation|UK|47.35|1975|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=441}}\n\n==Personal life and relationships==\n\n===Birthdate===\nBefore the 1998 release of Tony Fletcher's ''Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon'', Moon's date of birth was presumed to be 23 August 1947. This erroneous date appeared in several otherwise-reliable sources, including the Townshend-authorised biography ''Before I Get Old: The Story of The Who''.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=80}} The incorrect date had been supplied by Moon in interviews before it was corrected by Fletcher to 1946.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=1}}\n\n===Kim Kerrigan===\n{{main|Kim McLagan}}\nMoon's first serious relationship was with [[Kim Kerrigan]], whom he started dating in January 1965 after she saw the Who play at [[The Downstairs Club (later Le Disque a Go!

We'd go home and he'd start a fight with me.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=186}} He loved Amanda, but his absences due to touring and fondness for practical jokes made their relationship uneasy when she was very young. \"He had no idea how to be a father\", Kim said. \"He was too much of a child himself.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=220}}\n\nFrom 1971 to 1975 Moon owned [[Tara, Chertsey|Tara]], a home in Chertsey where he initially lived with his wife and daughter.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=290}} The Moons entertained extravagantly at home, and owned a number of cars.

He wanted to get sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals he wanted to do it at home.

In 2000, the book was released in the US as ''Moon (The Life and Death of a Rock Legend)''. ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]'' called the book \"horrific and terrific reading\", and ''[[Record Collector]]'' said it was \"one of rock's great biographies.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon |id={{ASIN|1844498077 |country=uk}}}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, [[English Heritage]] declined an application for Moon to be awarded a [[blue plaque]].

He was noted for his unique style and his eccentric, often self-destructive behaviour.\n\nMoon grew up in [[Alperton]], a suburb of [[Wembley]], in [[Middlesex]], and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After playing with a local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they recorded their first single. He remained with the band during their rise to fame, and was quickly recognised for his drumming style, which emphasised [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]], cymbal crashes, and [[Fill (music)|drum fills]]. Throughout Moon's tenure with the Who his drum kit steadily grew in size, and (along with [[Ginger Baker]]) he has been credited as one of the earliest rock drummers to regularly employ [[Double bass drumming|double bass drums]] in his setup. Moon occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation, and remained a member of the band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, however, Moon developed a reputation for [[Instrument destruction|smashing his kit]] on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated by blowing up toilets with [[cherry bomb]]s or [[dynamite]], and by destroying television sets. Moon enjoyed touring and socialising, and became bored and restless when the Who were inactive. His 21st birthday party in [[Flint, Michigan]], has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups.\n\nMoon suffered a number of setbacks during the 1970s, most notably the accidental death of chauffeur Neil Boland and the breakdown of his marriage. He became [[Alcohol abuse|addicted to alcohol]], particularly brandy and champagne, and acquired a reputation for decadence and dark humour; his nickname was \"Moon the Loon\". After moving to Los Angeles with personal assistant [[Dougal Butler|Peter \"Dougal\" Butler]] during the mid-1970s, Moon recorded his only solo album, the poorly received ''[[Two Sides of the Moon]]''. While touring with the Who, on several occasions he passed out on stage and was hospitalised. By the time of their final tour with him in 1976, and particularly during production of ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]'' and ''[[Who Are You]]'', the drummer's deterioration was evident. Moon moved back to London in 1978, dying in September of that year from an overdose of [[Clomethiazole|Heminevrin]], a drug intended to treat or prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.\n\nMoon's drumming continues to be praised by critics and musicians. He was posthumously inducted into the ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' Hall of Fame in 1982, becoming only the second rock drummer to be chosen, and in 2011, Moon was voted the second-greatest drummer in history by a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' readers' poll.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moderndrummer.com/modern-drummers-readers-poll-archive/#_ |title=Modern Drummer\u2019s Readers Poll Archive, 1979\u20132014 |work=[[Modern Drummer]] |accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"rsmoon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/rolling-stone-readers-pick-best-drummers-of-all-time-20110208/2-keith-moon-0397214 |title=Rolling Stone Readers Pick Best Drummers of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Central Middlesex Hospital, Clock Tower entrance - geograph.org.uk - 16176.jpg|alt=Central Middlesex Hospital|thumb|[[Central Middlesex Hospital]], Moon's place of birth]]\n\nKeith John Moon was born to Alfred Charles (Alf) and Kathleen Winifred (Kit) Moon{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=1}}{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=13}} on 23 August 1946 at [[Central Middlesex Hospital]] in northwest London, and grew up in Wembley. He was [[Hyperactivity|hyperactive]] as a boy, with a restless imagination and a particular fondness for ''[[The Goon Show]]'' and music. Moon attended [[Alperton Community School|Alperton Secondary Modern School]] after failing his [[eleven plus exam]], which precluded his attending a [[grammar school]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=9,11}} His art teacher said in a report: \"Retarded artistically. Idiotic in other respects\". His music teacher wrote that Moon \"has great ability, but must guard against a tendency to show off.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=15}}\n\nMoon joined his local [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]] band at the age of twelve on the [[bugle]], but found the instrument too difficult to learn and decided to take up drums instead.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=17}} He was interested in practical jokes and home science kits, with a particular fondness for explosions.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=20}} On his way home from school, Moon would often go to Macari's Music Studio on Ealing Road to practise on the drums there, learning his basic skills on the instrument. He left school at age fourteen, around Easter in 1961.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=22}} Moon then enrolled at Harrow Technical College; this led to a job as a radio repairman, enabling him to buy his first drum kit.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=29}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nMoon took lessons from one of the loudest contemporary drummers, [[Screaming Lord Sutch]]'s [[Carlo Little]], at 10 [[shilling]]s per lesson.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1496340/Carlo-Little.html\n|title=Obituaries: Carlo Little |accessdate=30 August 2013 |date=17 August 2005 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> Moon's early style was influenced by [[jazz]], American [[surf music]] and [[rhythm and blues]], exemplified by noted Los Angeles studio drummer [[Hal Blaine]]. His favourite musicians were jazz artists, particularly [[Gene Krupa]] (whose flamboyant style he subsequently copied).{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=237}} Moon also admired [[Elvis Presley]]'s original drummer [[DJ Fontana]], [[the Shadows]]' original drummer [[Tony Meehan]]{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=11}} and [[the Pretty Things]]' [[Viv Prince]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=100}} He also enjoyed singing, with a particular interest in [[Motown]].<ref name=\"amazingjourney\">{{cite video |title=Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who |publisher=Universal Pictures Video |asin=B000WBP282 |date=26 November 2007}}</ref> Moon idolised [[the Beach Boys]];{{sfn|Bogovich|Posner|2003|page=24}} [[Roger Daltrey]] later said that given the opportunity, Moon would have left to play for the California band even at the peak of the Who's fame.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/50277/roger-daltrey-keith-moon-wouldve-left-the-who-for-the-beach-boys |title=Roger Daltrey: 'Keith Moon Would've Left The Who for The Beach Boys' |last1=Colothan |first1=Scott |date=2 April 2009 |website=Gigwise |accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time Moon joined his first serious band: the Escorts, replacing his best friend Gerry Evans.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=38}} In December 1962 he joined the Beachcombers, a semi-professional London [[cover band]] playing hits by groups such as the Shadows.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=46}} During his time in the group Moon incorporated theatrical tricks into his act, including \"shooting\" the group's lead singer with a starter pistol.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=48\u201366}} The Beachcombers all had day jobs; Moon, who worked in the sales department at [[British Gypsum]], had the keenest interest in turning professional. In April 1964, aged 17,{{sfn|Case|2010|p=146}} he auditioned for the Who as a replacement for [[Doug Sandom]]. The Beachcombers continued as a local cover band after his departure.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=71\u201375}}\n\n===The Who===\n{{main|The Who}}\n[[File:Keith Moon 1967.jpg|alt=Unsmiling young man in a T-shirt, holding a bottle|thumb|upright|Moon backstage in [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany, 1967]]\n\nA commonly cited story of how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed [[Red hair|ginger]] (future bandmate [[Pete Townshend]] later described him as a \"ginger vision\"),<ref name=\"stein\">{{cite AV media |people=The Who |title=The Kids Are Alright |medium=movie |publisher=Jeff Stein, Sydney Rose |location=England |year=1979 |url=http://www.thewho.net/linernotes/TKAA.html}}</ref>{{rp|52:40}} he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; he played in the set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process.{{sfn|Chapman|1998|p=70}} In the words of the drummer, \"they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Rockin' in Time |last=Szatmary |first=David P. |publisher=Pearson |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-205-93624-3 |location=United States |pages=129}}</ref> Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had \"just been filling in for the last fifteen years.\"<ref name=\"stein\"/>{{rp|52:29}}\n\nMoon's arrival in the Who changed the dynamics of the group. Sandom had generally been the peacemaker as Daltrey and Townshend feuded between themselves, but because of Moon's temperament the group now had four members frequently in conflict. \"We used to fight regularly\", remembered Moon in later years. \"[[John Entwistle|John [Entwistle]]] and I used to have fights&nbsp;\u2013 it wasn't very serious, it was more of an emotional spur-of-the moment thing.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=87}} Moon also clashed with Daltrey and Townshend: \"We really have absolutely nothing in common apart from music\", he said in a later interview.<ref>{{cite book |title=Roger Daltrey: The biography |page=28 |first=Tim |last=Ewbank |first2=Stafford |last2=Hildred |publisher=Hachette UK |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4055-1845-1}}</ref> Although Townshend described him as a \"completely different person to anyone I've ever met\",<ref name=\"stein\"/>{{rp|38:48}} the pair had a rapport in the early years and enjoyed practical jokes and improvised comedy. Moon's drumming style affected the band's musical structure; although Entwistle initially found Moon's lack of conventional timekeeping problematic, it created an original sound.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=87}}\n\nMoon was particularly fond of touring, since it was his only chance to regularly socialise with his bandmates, and was generally restless and bored when not playing live. This later carried over to other aspects of his life, as he acted them out (according to journalist and Who biographer [[Dave Marsh]]) \"as if his life were one long tour.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=354}} These antics earned him the nickname \"Moon the Loon\".{{sfn|Case|2010|p=145}}\n\n====Musical contributions====\n{{quote box|align=right|width=35em|quote=I suppose as a drummer, I'm adequate.

That's why he had two sets of tom-toms.

Moon's contribution.\"{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=35}} Contemporary critics questioned his ability to keep time, with biographer [[Tony Fletcher]] suggesting that the timing on ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'' was \"all over the place.\" Who producer Jon Astley said, \"You didn't think he was keeping time, but he was.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=234}} Early recordings of Moon's drumming sound tinny and disorganised;<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Who's Next (2003 remaster) |author=John Atkins |page=23 |publisher=Polydor |id=113 056-2}}</ref> it was not until the recording of ''[[Who's Next]]'', with [[Glyn Johns]]' no-nonsense production techniques and the need to keep time to a synthesizer track, that he began developing more discipline in the studio. Fletcher considers the drumming on this album to be the best of Moon's career.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=286}}\n\nUnlike contemporary rock drummers such as [[Ginger Baker]] and [[John Bonham]], Moon hated drum solos and refused to play them in concert. At a [[Madison Square Garden]] show on [[The Who Tour 1974|10 June 1974]], Townshend and Entwistle decided to spontaneously stop playing during \"[[Waspman]]\" to listen to Moon's drum solo. Moon continued briefly and then stopped, shouting \"Drum solos are boring!\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=329}} On 23 June 1977, he made a guest appearance at a [[Led Zeppelin]] concert in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/keith-moon-led-zeppelin/ |title=The Day Keith Moon Joined Led Zeppelin Onstage |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Keith-Moon Bellboy.jpg|alt=Keith Moon singing|thumb|left|Moon singing at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], Toronto, 21 October 1976;{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=466}} he enjoyed singing whenever possible.]]\n\nMoon also aspired to sing lead vocal on some songs.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=183}} While the other three members handled most of the onstage vocals, Moon would attempt to sing backup (particularly on \"[[I Can't Explain]]\").

Moon's performance on \"[[Bell Boy (song)|Bell Boy]]\" (''[[Quadrophenia]]'', 1973) saw him abandon \"serious\" vocal performances to sing in character, which gave him (in Fletcher's words) \"full licence to live up to his reputation as a lecherous drunk\"; it was \"exactly the kind of performance the Who needed from him to bring them back down to earth.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=346}}\n\nMoon composed \"I Need You\", the instrumental \"Cobwebs and Strange\" (from the album ''[[A Quick One]]'', 1966),{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=80}} the single B-sides \"In The City\" (co-written with Entwistle){{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=71}} and \"Girl's Eyes\" (from ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' sessions featured on ''[[Thirty Years of Maximum R&B]]'' and a 1995 re-release of ''The Who Sell Out''), \"Dogs Part Two\" (1969), \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\" (1969){{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=296}} and \"Waspman\" (1972).{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=173}} Moon also co-composed \"[[The Ox (instrumental)|The Ox]]\" (an instrumental from their debut album, ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'') with Townshend, Entwistle and keyboardist [[Nicky Hopkins]].

When Haynes said that it would be prohibitively expensive, Moon replied: \"Dear boy, do exactly as you feel it should be, but that's the way I want it.\" The kit was eventually fitted with copper fittings{{sfn|Doerschuk|1989|p=2}} and later given to a young [[Zak Starkey]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=462}}\n\n====Destroying instruments and other stunts====\nAt an early show at the Railway Tavern in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], Townshend [[Instrument destruction|smashed his guitar]] after accidentally breaking it. When the audience demanded he do it again, Moon kicked over his drum kit.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=125}} Subsequent live sets culminated in what the band later described as \"[[auto-destructive art]]\", in which band members (particularly Moon and Townshend) elaborately destroyed their equipment. Moon developed a habit of kicking over his drums, claiming that he did so in exasperation at an audience's indifference.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=126}} Townshend later said, \"A set of skins is about $300 [then \u00a396] and after every show he'd just go bang, bang, bang and then kick the whole thing over.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=267}}\n\nIn May 1966, Moon discovered that the Beach Boys' [[Bruce Johnston]] was visiting London. After the pair socialised for a few days, Moon and Entwistle brought Johnston to the set of ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'',{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=159}} which made them late for a show with the Who that evening. During the finale of \"[[My Generation]]\", an altercation broke out on stage between Moon and Townshend which was reported on the front page of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' the following week. Moon and Entwistle left the Who for a week (with Moon hoping to join [[the Animals]] or [[the Nashville Teens]]), but they changed their minds and returned.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=156\u2013160}}\n\nOn the Who's early US package tour at the RKO 58th Street Theatre in New York in March and April 1967, Moon performed two or three shows a day, kicking over his drum kit after every show.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|pp=241, 247}} Later that year, during their appearance on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', he bribed a stagehand to load [[gunpowder]] into one of his bass drums; the stagehand used about ten times the standard amount.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=275}} During the finale of \"My Generation\", he kicked the drum off the riser and set off the charge. The intensity of the explosion singed Townshend's hair and embedded a piece of cymbal in Moon's arm.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=276}} A clip of the incident became the opening scene for the film ''The Kids Are Alright''.<ref name=\"stein\"/>{{rp|7:44}}\n\nAlthough Moon was known for kicking over his drum kit, Haynes claimed that it was done carefully and the kit rarely needed repairs.

In 1966 he worked with [[Yardbirds]] guitarist [[Jeff Beck]], pianist Nicky Hopkins and future Led Zeppelin members [[Jimmy Page]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] on the instrumental \"[[Beck's Bolero]]\", which was the B-side to \"[[Hi Ho Silver Lining]]\" and appeared on the album ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]''.

When he briefly considered leaving the Who in 1966, he spoke with Entwistle and Page about forming a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]. Moon (or Entwistle) remarked that a particular suggestion had gone down like a \"lead [[zeppelin]]\" (a play on \"lead balloon\"). Although that supergroup was never formed, Page remembered the phrase and later adapted it as the name of his new band.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=225}}<!--Since it's only speculation that Moon used the phrase (it could just as easily have been Entwistle), I don't think this paragraph belongs in this article.-->\n\n[[The Beatles]] became friends with Moon, and this led to occasional collaborations.

[[Track Records]]-MCA released a Moon solo single in 1974, comprising cover versions of [[the Beach Boys]]' \"[[Don't Worry, Baby]]\" and \"Teenage Idol\". The following year he released his only solo album, entitled ''[[Two Sides of the Moon]]''. Although it featured Moon on vocals, he played drums on only three tracks; most of the drumming was left to others (including [[Ringo Starr]], [[session musician]]s Curly Smith and [[Jim Keltner]], and actor-musician [[Miguel Ferrer]]).{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=402\u2013406}} The album was received poorly by critics. ''New Musical Express''{{'}}s Roy Carr wrote, \"Moonie, if you didn't have talent, I wouldn't care; but you have, which is why I'm not about to accept ''Two Sides of the Moon''.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=428}} Dave Marsh, reviewing the album in ''Rolling Stone'', wrote: \"There isn't any legitimate reason for this album's existence.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=429}} During one of his few televised solo drum performances (for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Wide World''), Moon played a five-minute drum solo dressed as a cat on transparent acrylic drums filled with water and [[goldfish]]. When asked by an audience member what would happen to the kit, he joked that \"even the best drummers get hungry.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=259}} His performance was not appreciated by animal lovers, several of whom called the station with complaints.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=259}}\n\n====Film====\nIn the 2007 documentary film ''[[Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who]]'', Daltrey and Townshend reminisced about Moon's talent for dressing as (and embodying) a variety of characters. They remembered his dream of getting out of music and becoming a Hollywood film actor,<ref name=\"amazingjourney\"/>{{better source|date=October 2013}} although Daltrey did not think Moon had the patience and work ethic required by a professional actor. Who manager Bill Curbishley agreed that Moon \"wasn't disciplined enough to actually turn up or commit to doing the stuff.\"{{sfn|Chapman|1998|p=80}}\n\nNevertheless, the drummer landed several acting roles. His first was in 1971, a [[Cameo role|cameo]] in [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[200 Motels]]'' as a nun afraid of dying from a drug overdose. Although it only took 13 days to film, fellow cast member [[Howard Kaylan]] remembers Moon spending off-camera time at the Kensington Garden Hotel bar instead of sleeping.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=280}} Moon's next film role was J.D.

During the Who's early days he began taking [[amphetamines]],{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=165}} and in a ''NME'' interview said his favourite food was \"[[Dexamyl|French Blues]]\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=178}} He spent his share of the band's income quickly, and was a regular at London clubs such as the [[Speakeasy Club|Speakeasy]] and [[The Bag O'Nails]]; the combination of pills and alcohol escalated into alcoholism and drug addiction later in his life.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=224}} \"[We] went through the same stages everybody goes through&nbsp;\u2013 the bloody drug corridor\", he later reflected. \"Drinking suited the group a lot better.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=262}}\n\nAccording to Townshend, Moon began destroying hotel rooms when the Who stayed at the [[Berlin]] Hilton on tour in late 1966.{{sfn|Townshend|2012|p=94}} In addition to hotel rooms, Moon destroyed friends' homes and even his own, throwing furniture from upper-storey windows and lighting fires. Andrew Neill and Matthew Kent estimated that his destruction of hotel toilets and plumbing cost as much as \u00a3300,000 ($500,000).{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|page=265}} These acts, often fuelled by drugs and alcohol, were Moon's way of demonstrating his eccentricity; he enjoyed shocking the public with them. Longtime friend and personal assistant Butler observed, \"He was trying to make people laugh and be Mr Funny, he wanted people to love him and enjoy him, but he would go so far.

He did not keep a drum kit or practise at [[Tara, Chertsey|Tara]], and began to deteriorate physically as a result of his lifestyle.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=267-268}} Around the same time he became a severe [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], starting the day with drinks and changing from the \"lovable boozer\" he presented himself as to a \"boorish drunk\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=268}} [[David Puttnam]] recalled, \"The drinking went from being a joke to being a problem.

According to Fletcher, Moon's toilet pyrotechnics began in 1965 when he purchased a case of 500 [[cherry bomb]]s.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=194}} He moved from cherry bombs to [[M-80 (explosive)|M-80]] fireworks to sticks of [[dynamite]], which became his explosive of choice.<ref name=\"osley\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thecnj.com/review/2009/031209/feat031209_03.html?headline=Who%E2%80%99s_vexed%3F_Rival_%E2%80%98blue_plaque%E2%80%99_for_Moon_puts_heritage_row_centre_stage|title=Who's vexed?

I'd been used to penny bangers before.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=194}} He quickly developed a reputation for destroying bathrooms and blowing up toilets. The destruction mesmerised him, and enhanced his public image as rock's premier hell-raiser. Tony Fletcher wrote that \"no toilet in a hotel or changing room was safe\" until Moon had exhausted his supply of explosives.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=194}}\n\nPete Townshend walked into the bathroom of Moon's hotel room and noticed the toilet had disappeared, with only the S-bend remaining. The drummer explained that since a cherry bomb was about to explode, he had thrown it down the loo and showed Townshend the case of cherry bombs. \"And of course from that moment on,\" the guitarist remembered, \"we got thrown out of every hotel we ever stayed in.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=270}}\n\nEntwistle recalled being close to Moon on tour: \"I suppose we were two of a kind\"...&nbsp;We shared a room on the road and got up to no good.\"<ref name=\"jones\"/> Consequently, both were often involved in blowing up toilets.

The Who spent the afternoon visiting local radio stations with Nancy Lewis (then the band's publicist), and Moon posed for a photo outside the hotel in front of a \"Happy Birthday Keith\" sign put up by the hotel management. According to Lewis, Moon was drunk by the time the band went onstage at [[Atwood Stadium]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=196}}\n\nReturning to the hotel, Moon started a food fight and soon cake began flying through the air. The drummer knocked out part of his front tooth; at the hospital, doctors could not give him an anaesthetic (due to his inebriation) before removing the remainder of the tooth. Back at the hotel a m\u00eal\u00e9e erupted; fire extinguishers were set off, guests (and objects) thrown into the swimming pool and a piano reportedly destroyed. The chaos ended only when police arrived with guns drawn.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=196}}\n\nA furious Holiday Inn management presented the groups with a bill for $24,000, which was reportedly settled by Herman's Hermits tour manager Edd McCann.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=196\u20137}} Townshend claimed that the Who were banned for life from all of the hotel's properties,{{sfn|Townshend|2012|p=37}} but Fletcher wrote that they stayed at a Holiday Inn in [[Rochester, New York]] a week later. He also disputed a widely held belief that Moon drove a [[Lincoln Continental]] into the hotel's swimming pool, as claimed by the drummer in a 1972 ''Rolling Stone'' interview.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=196\u20137}}\n\n===Passing out on stage===\n[[File:Keith Moon.jpg|alt=Keith Moon playing the drums|thumb|Moon at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], Toronto, 21 October 1976.

During the 1973 [[Quadrophenia]] tour, at the Who's debut US date at the [[Cow Palace]] in [[Daly City, California]], Moon ingested a mixture of [[tranquilliser]]s and [[brandy]]. During the concert, Moon passed out on his drum kit during \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]].\" The band stopped playing, and a group of [[road crew|roadies]] carried Moon offstage. They gave him a shower and an injection of [[cortisone]], sending him back onstage after a thirty-minute delay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/roger-daltrey-interview-2018|title=Roger Daltrey: 'Keith Moon lived his entire life as a fantasy'|first=Dylan|last=Jones|website=British GQ}}</ref> Moon passed out again during \"[[Magic Bus (song)|Magic Bus]],\" and was again removed from the stage. The band continued without him for several songs before Townshend asked, \"Can anyone play the drums? \u2013 I mean somebody good?\" A drummer in the audience, [[Scot Halpin]], came up and played the rest of the show.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=361\u2013362}}\n\nDuring the opening date of the band's March 1976 US tour at the [[Boston Garden]], Moon passed out over his drum kit after two numbers and the show was rescheduled. The next evening Moon systematically destroyed everything in his hotel room, cut himself doing so and passed out. He was discovered by manager Bill Curbishley, who took him to a hospital, telling him \"I'm gonna get the doctor to get you nice and fit, so you're back within two days. Because I want to break your fucking jaw&nbsp;... You have fucked this band around so many times and I'm not having it any more.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=475}} Doctors told Curbishley that if he had not intervened, Moon would have bled to death.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=457}} Marsh suggested that at this point Daltrey and Entwistle seriously considered firing Moon, but decided that doing so would make his life worse.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=476}}\n\nEntwistle has said that Moon and the Who reached their live peak in 1975\u201376.  At the end of the 1976 US tour in Miami that August, the drummer, delirious, was treated in Hollywood Memorial Hospital for eight days. The group was concerned that he would be unable to complete the last leg of the tour, which ended at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto on 21 October (Moon's last public show).{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=464\u2013466}}  During the band's recording sabbatical between 1976 and 1978, Moon gained a considerable amount of weight.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=492}}  By the time of the Who's invitation-only show at the [[Gaumont State Cinema]] on 15 December 1977 for ''The Kids are Alright'', Moon was visibly overweight and had difficulty sustaining a solid performance.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=494}} After recording ''[[Who Are You]]'', Townshend refused to follow the album with a tour unless Moon stopped drinking,{{sfn|Townshend|2012|p=264}} and said that if Moon's playing did not improve he would be fired.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=496}} Daltrey later denied threatening to fire him, but said that by this time the drummer was out of control.{{sfn|Chapman|1998|p=84}}\n\n===Financial problems===\nBecause the Who's early stage act relied on smashing instruments, and owing to Moon's enthusiasm for damaging hotels, the group were in debt for much of the 1960s; Entwistle estimated they lost about \u00a3150,000.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=304}} Even when the group became relatively financially stable after ''Tommy'', Moon continued to rack up debts. He bought a number of cars and gadgets, and flirted with bankruptcy.{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=354}} Moon's recklessness with money reduced his profit from the group's 1975 UK tour to \u00a347.35 ({{Inflation|UK|47.35|1975|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=441}}\n\n==Personal life and relationships==\n\n===Birthdate===\nBefore the 1998 release of Tony Fletcher's ''Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon'', Moon's date of birth was presumed to be 23 August 1947.

Townshend disagreed, assuring him that \"lightning wouldn't strike the same place twice\".{{sfn|Townshend|2012|p=268}}\n\nAfter moving in, Moon began a prescribed course of Heminevrin ([[clomethiazole]], a [[sedative]]) to alleviate his [[alcohol withdrawal]] symptoms. He wanted to get sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals he wanted to do it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised [[Alcohol detoxification|detoxification]] because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]], and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol.<ref>{{cite book |title=Meyler's Side Effects of Psychiatric Drugs |editor1-first=J K |editor1-last=Aronson |publisher=Elsevier |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-444-53266-4 |page=439}}</ref> The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle.

After dining with the McCartneys at Peppermint Park in [[Covent Garden]], Moon and Walter-Lax returned to their flat. He watched a film (''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]''), and asked Walter-Lax to cook him steak and eggs. When she objected, Moon replied, \"If you don't like it, you can fuck off!\" These were his [[last words]].<ref name=\"wilkes\"/> Moon then took 32 clomethiazole tablets. When Walter-Lax checked on him the following afternoon, she discovered he was dead.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=517}}\n\nCurbishley phoned the flat at around 5&nbsp;pm looking for Moon, and Dymond gave him the news. Curbishley told Townshend, who informed the rest of the band. Entwistle was giving an interview to French journalists when he was interrupted by a phone call with the news of Moon's death. Trying to tactfully and quickly end the interview, he broke down and wept when the journalist asked him about the Who's future plans.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=518}}\n\nMoon's death came shortly after the release of ''[[Who Are You]]''.
