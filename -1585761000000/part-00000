Preparations for the film began immediately after the release of ''Furious 7'', with Diesel, Morgan, and producer [[Neal H. Moritz]] re-signing. After setting an initial release date in the same month, casting took place between April and June 2015. In October 2015, Gray was announced to direct the film in the place of [[James Wan]], who had directed the previous installment.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the performances and action sequences, but criticized the storyline. The film grossed over $1.2&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the thirtieth film (and the second in the franchise, after ''Furious 7'') to gross over $1&nbsp;billion, the [[2017 in film#Highest grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2017]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|nineteenth highest-grossing film of all time]].

Sensing Raldo is a [[loan shark]], Dom challenges Raldo to a race, pitting Fernando's reworked car against Raldo's, and wagering his own Third Generation [[Chevrolet Impala]]. After narrowly winning the race, Dom allows Raldo to keep his car, earning his respect, and instead leaves his cousin with his car.\n\nThe next day, Dom is approached by the elusive [[Cyberterrorism|cyberterrorist]] Cipher who coerces him into working for her by showing him an unseen photo. Shortly afterwards, Dom and his team, comprising Letty, Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, and Ramsey, are recruited by [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs to help him retrieve an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP device]] from a military outpost in [[Berlin]]. During the getaway, Dom goes rogue, forcing Hobbs off the road and stealing the device for Cipher. Hobbs is arrested and locked up in the same high-security prison in which he helped imprison Shaw. After Shaw and Hobbs both escape the prison, they are recruited by intelligence operative [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Mr. Nobody|Mr. Nobody]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to help the team find Dom and capture Cipher. Shaw reveals that Cipher had hired his brother Owen to steal the Nightshade device and Mose Jakande to steal God's Eye, Ramsey's software program. The team tracks Dom and Cipher to their very location just as the latter two attack the base, causing injuries to the team, and stealing God's Eye. Roman suggests bringing [[Brian O'Conner|Brian]] in to help them, but Letty rejects the idea as they agreed not to bring him and Mia into any more missions for the sake of their children.\n\nWhen Dom questions Cipher's motives, she reveals that she has been holding hostage Dom's ex-lover and DSS agent Elena Neves\u2014as well as their son, of whose existence Dom was previously unaware. Elena tells Dom that she wanted him to decide the child's first name, having already given him the middle name Marcos.\n\nIn New York City, Cipher sends Dom to retrieve a [[nuclear football]] held by the [[Ministry of Defense (Russia)|Russian Minister of Defense]]. Prior to the theft, Dom briefly evades Cipher\u2014with the help of Raldo\u2014and persuades Shaw's mother, Magdalene Shaw, to help him. Cipher hacks into the electronics systems of a large number of cars, causing them to disable the convoy so that Dom can take the football. The team intercepts Dom, but Dom escapes, shooting and apparently killing Shaw in the process. Letty catches up to Dom, but is ambushed and nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes, before Dom rescues her. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute Elena in front of a helpless Dom.\n\nDom infiltrates a base in Russia to use the EMP device to disable their security and then to disable a [[nuclear submarine]], enabling Cipher to hijack it and attempt to use its arsenal to trigger a nuclear war. They are once again intercepted by the team, who attempt to shut down the sub, and then drive out toward the gates that would prevent the sub from leaving into open waters. Meanwhile, Shaw, whose death was faked, teams up with Owen, and at Magdalene's behest, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son. Once Shaw reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, before rejoining his team. Infuriated, Cipher fires an [[infrared homing]] missile at Dom, but he breaks away from his team and maneuvers around it, causing the missile to hit the submarine instead. The team quickly forms a vehicular blockade around Dom, shielding him from the ensuing explosion. Shaw reaches the front of the plane and confronts Cipher, who jumps from the plane with a parachute.\n\nMr. Nobody and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 visit Dom and his team in New York City to report that Cipher is still at large in [[Athens]].

Preparations for the film began immediately after the release of ''Furious 7'', with Diesel, Morgan, and producer [[Neal H. Moritz]] re-signing. After setting an initial release date in the same month, casting took place between April and June 2015. In October 2015, Gray was announced to direct the film in the place of [[James Wan]], who had directed the previous installment. [[Principal photography]] began in March 2016 in locations such as [[M\u00fdvatn]], [[Havana]], [[Atlanta]], [[Cleveland]], and New York City, continuing the franchise's tradition of filming in exotic locations around the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Where was The Fate of the Furious filmed?|url=http://www.atlasofwonders.com/2017/04/the-fate-of-furious-filming-locations.html|work=Atlas of Wonders|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n''The Fate of the Furious'' premiered in [[Berlin]] on April 4, 2017 and was theatrically released in conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters in the United States on April 14, 2017 while also playing in [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]] internationally. The film received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the performances and action sequences, but criticized the storyline. The film grossed over $1.2&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the thirtieth film (and the second in the franchise, after ''Furious 7'') to gross over $1&nbsp;billion, the [[2017 in film#Highest grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2017]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|nineteenth highest-grossing film of all time]].

Sensing Raldo is a [[loan shark]], Dom challenges Raldo to a race, pitting Fernando's reworked car against Raldo's, and wagering his own Third Generation [[Chevrolet Impala]]. After narrowly winning the race, Dom allows Raldo to keep his car, earning his respect, and instead leaves his cousin with his car.\n\nThe next day, Dom is approached by the elusive [[Cyberterrorism|cyberterrorist]] Cipher who coerces him into working for her by showing him an unseen photo. Shortly afterwards, Dom and his team, comprising Letty, Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, and Ramsey, are recruited by [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs to help him retrieve an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP device]] from a military outpost in [[Berlin]]. During the getaway, Dom goes rogue, forcing Hobbs off the road and stealing the device for Cipher. Hobbs is arrested and locked up in the same high-security prison in which he helped imprison Shaw. After Shaw and Hobbs both escape the prison, they are recruited by intelligence operative [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Mr. Nobody|Mr. Nobody]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to help the team find Dom and capture Cipher. Shaw reveals that Cipher had hired his brother Owen to steal the Nightshade device and Mose Jakande to steal God's Eye, Ramsey's software program. The team tracks Dom and Cipher to their very location just as the latter two attack the base, causing injuries to the team, and stealing God's Eye. Roman suggests bringing [[Brian O'Conner|Brian]] in to help them, but Letty rejects the idea as they agreed not to bring him & Mia into any more missions for the sake of their children.\n\nWhen Dom questions Cipher's motives, she reveals that she has been holding hostage Dom's ex-lover and DSS agent Elena Neves\u2014as well as their son, of whose existence Dom was previously unaware. Elena tells Dom that she wanted him to decide the child's first name, having already given him the middle name Marcos.\n\nIn New York City, Cipher sends Dom to retrieve a [[nuclear football]] held by the [[Ministry of Defense (Russia)|Russian Minister of Defense]]. Prior to the theft, Dom briefly evades Cipher\u2014with the help of Raldo\u2014and persuades Shaw's mother, Magdalene Shaw, to help him. Cipher hacks into the electronics systems of a large number of cars, causing them to disable the convoy so that Dom can take the football. The team intercepts Dom, but Dom escapes, shooting and apparently killing Shaw in the process. Letty catches up to Dom, but is ambushed and nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes, before Dom rescues her. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute Elena in front of a helpless Dom.\n\nDom infiltrates a base in Russia to use the EMP device to disable their security and then to disable a [[nuclear submarine]], enabling Cipher to hijack it and attempt to use its arsenal to trigger a nuclear war. They are once again intercepted by the team, who attempt to shut down the sub, and then drive out toward the gates that would prevent the sub from leaving into open waters. Meanwhile, Shaw, whose death was faked, teams up with Owen, and at Magdalene's behest, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son. Once Shaw reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, before rejoining his team. Infuriated, Cipher fires an [[infrared homing]] missile at Dom, but he breaks away from his team and maneuvers around it, causing the missile to hit the submarine instead.

Ruby is one of the traditional [[cardinal gem]]s, together with [[amethyst]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], and [[diamond]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218182752/https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 |date=December 18, 2017 }}, Max Bauer, p. 2</ref> The word ''ruby'' comes from ''ruber'', [[Latin]] for red. The color of a ruby is due to the element [[chromium]].\n\nSome gemstones that are popularly or historically called rubies, such as the [[Black Prince's Ruby]] in the British [[Imperial State Crown]], are actually [[spinel]]s. These were once known as \"Balas rubies\".\n\nThe quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with [[carat (mass)|carat]] weight, affect its value. The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like [[rutile]] [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] may indicate that the stone has been treated. Ruby is the traditional [[birthstone]] for July and is usually [[pink]]er than [[garnet]], although some [[rhodolite]] garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. The world's most valuable ruby is the [[Sunrise Ruby]].\n\n==Physical properties==\n[[Image:Corundum.png|thumb|left|Crystal structure of rubies]]\nRubies have a [[hardness]] of 9.0 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]. Among the natural gems only [[moissanite]] and [[diamond]] are harder, with diamond having a Mohs hardness of 10.0 and moissanite falling somewhere in between corundum (ruby) and diamond in hardness. Sapphire, ruby, and pure corundum are \u03b1-alumina, the most stable form of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, in which 3 electrons leave each aluminium [[ion]] to join the regular octahedral group of six nearby O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions; in pure corundum this leaves all of the aluminium ions with a very stable configuration of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels, and the crystal is perfectly colorless.\n\n[[Image: Ruby model.jpg|thumb|left|Crystal structure of ruby showing the substitution of Al<sup>3+</sup> ions (blue) with Cr<sup>3+</sup> (red).  The substitution density of Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions in this model is approximately 2%, approximating the maximum doping normally encountered.<ref>[https://www.miramodus.com/images.shtml Images of molecular models from Miramodus]</ref>]]\n\nWhen a chromium atom replaces an occasional aluminium atom, it too loses 3 electrons to become a chromium<sup>3+</sup> ion to maintain the charge balance of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> crystal.  However, the Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions are larger and have [[Electron configuration#Ionization of the transition metals|electron orbitals]] in different directions than aluminium. The octahedral arrangement of the O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions is distorted, and the energy levels of the different orbitals of those Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions are slightly altered because of the directions to the O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions.<ref name=causes>{{cite web | url= http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | title= Ruby: causes of color | accessdate= 28 Mar 2016 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160321193313/http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | archivedate= March 21, 2016 | df= mdy-all }}</ref> Those energy differences correspond to absorption in the ultraviolet, violet, and yellow-green regions of the spectrum.\n\n[[Image:Ruby transmittance.svg |thumb|Transmittance of ruby in optical and near-IR spectra. Note the two broad violet and yellow-green absorption bands and one narrow absorption band at the wavelength of 694 nm, which is the wavelength of the ruby laser.]]\n\nIf one percent of the aluminium ions are replaced by chromium in ruby, the yellow-green absorption results in a red color for the gem.<ref name=causes/>  Additionally, absorption at any of the above wavelengths stimulates [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] emission of 694-nanometer-wavelength red light, which adds to its red color and perceived [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]].\n\nAfter absorbing short-wavelength light, there is a short interval of time when the crystal lattice of ruby is in an excited state before fluorescence occurs. If 694-nanometer photons pass through the crystal during that time, they can stimulate more fluorescent photons to be emitted in-phase with them, thus strengthening the intensity of that red light. By arranging mirrors or other means to pass  emitted light repeatedly through the crystal, a [[ruby laser]] in this way produces a very high intensity of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] red light.\n\nAll natural rubies have imperfections in them, including color impurities and inclusions of [[rutile]] needles known as \"silk\". Gemologists use these needle inclusions found in natural rubies to distinguish them from synthetics, simulants, or substitutes. Usually, the rough stone is heated before cutting. These days, almost all rubies are treated in some form, with heat treatment being the most common practice. Untreated rubies of high quality command a large premium.\n\nSome rubies show a three-point or six-point [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] or \"star\". These rubies are cut into [[cabochons]] to display the effect properly. Asterisms are best visible with a single-light source and move across the stone as the light moves or the stone is rotated. Such effects occur when light is reflected off the \"silk\" (the structurally oriented [[rutile]] needle inclusions) in a certain way. This is one example where inclusions increase the value of a gemstone. Furthermore, rubies can show color changes\u2014though this occurs very rarely\u2014as well as [[chatoyancy]] or the \"cat's eye\" effect.\n\n===Ruby vs. pink sapphire===\nGenerally, gemstone-quality corundum in all shades of red, including pink, are called rubies.<ref name=\"matlins\">{{cite book|last=Matlins|first=Antoinette Leonard|title=Colored Gemstones|year=2010|publisher=Gemstone Press|isbn=0-943763-72-X|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502140108/https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|archivedate=May 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Peter|title=Gemmology|year=1991|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=0-7506-6449-5|page=337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102012607/https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|archivedate=January 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  However, in the United States, a minimum color saturation must be met to be called a ruby; otherwise, the stone will be called a [[sapphire|pink sapphire]].<ref name=\"matlins\" />  Drawing a distinction between rubies and pink sapphires is relatively new, having arisen sometime in the 20th century.

That region has produced some exceptional rubies, however in recent years few good rubies have been found. In central Myanmar, the area of Mong Hsu began producing rubies during the 1990s and rapidly became the world's main ruby mining area. The most recently found ruby deposit in Myanmar is in Namya (Namyazeik) located in the northern state of [[Kachin State|Kachin]].\n\nRubies are also mined in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. In [[Azad Kashmir|Pakistani Kashmir]] there are vast proven reserves of millions of rubies, worth up to half a billion dollars.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rubies, the buried treasures of Pakistani Kashmir |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20171015-rubies-buried-treasures-pakistani-kashmir|publisher=[[France24]]}}</ref> However, as of 2017 there was only one mine (at Chitta Katha) due to lack of investment.<ref>{{cite news|author=Caroline Nelly Perrot|title=Rubies, the buried treasures of Pakistani Kashmir |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-10-rubies-treasures-pakistani-kashmir.html}}</ref> In Afghanistan, rubies are mined at Jegdalek.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The dangerous world of Pakistan\u2019s gem trade |url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/world/pakistans-blood-stones/|magazine=[[Maclean's]]}}</ref>\n\nIn Sri Lanka, lighter shades of rubies (often \"pink sapphires\") are more commonly found.\n\n==Factors affecting value==\nRubies, as with other gemstones, are graded using criteria known as the four Cs, namely color, cut, clarity and carat weight. Rubies are also evaluated on the basis of their geographic origin.\n\n'''Color:''' In the evaluation of colored gemstones, color is the most important factor. Color divides into three components: ''hue'', ''saturation'' and ''tone''. Hue refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the ''pure spectral hues'' of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.<ref name=wise>{{cite book|author=Wise, Richard W. |title=Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones |pages=18\u201322 |isbn=0-9728223-8-0 |year=2006|publisher=Brunswick House Press}}</ref> In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone, we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nImage:Ruby cristal.jpg|A naturally occurring ruby crystal\nImage:Ruby gem.JPG|Natural ruby with inclusions\nImage:Cut Ruby.jpg|A cut pink ruby\nImage:Rubis, calcite 14.jpg|Purple rubies\n</gallery>\n\n==Treatments and enhancements==\nImproving the quality of gemstones by treating them is common practice. Some treatments are used in almost all cases and are therefore considered acceptable. During the late 1990s, a large supply of low-cost materials caused a sudden surge in supply of heat-treated rubies, leading to a downward pressure on ruby prices.\n\nImprovements used include color alteration, improving transparency by dissolving rutile inclusions, healing of fractures (cracks) or even completely filling them.\n\nThe most common treatment is the application of heat. Most rubies at the lower end of the market are heat treated to improve color, remove ''purple tinge'', blue patches, and silk. These heat treatments typically occur around temperatures of 1800&nbsp;\u00b0C (3300&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref name=\"ThemelisRubyHeat\">{{cite book|isbn=0940965100|title=The Heat Treatment of Ruby and Sapphire|publisher=Gemlab Inc.|place=Bangkok, Thailand|year=1992}}</ref> Some rubies undergo a process of low tube heat, when the stone is heated over charcoal of a temperature of about 1300&nbsp;\u00b0C (2400&nbsp;\u00b0F) for 20 to 30 minutes. The silk is partially broken, and the color is improved.\n\nAnother treatment, which has become more frequent in recent years, is <!-- to avoid false positives for 'is led/lead' typo-->[[lead glass]] filling. Filling the fractures inside the ruby with lead glass (or a similar material) dramatically improves the transparency of the stone, making previously unsuitable rubies fit for applications in jewelry.<ref>Vincent Pardieu [http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf Lead Glass Filled/Repaired Rubies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831062843/http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf |date=August 31, 2011 }}. Asian Institute of Gemological Sciences Gem Testing Laboratory. February 2005</ref> The process is done in four steps:\n\n# The rough stones are pre-polished to eradicate all surface impurities that may affect the process\n# The rough is cleaned with [[hydrogen fluoride]]\n# The first heating process during which no fillers are added. The heating process eradicates impurities inside the fractures. Although this can be done at temperatures up to 1400&nbsp;\u00b0C (2500&nbsp;\u00b0F) it most likely occurs at a temperature of around 900&nbsp;\u00b0C (1600&nbsp;\u00b0F) since the rutile silk is still intact.\n# The second heating process in an electrical oven with different chemical additives. Different solutions and mixes have shown to be successful, however mostly lead-containing glass-powder is used at present. The ruby is dipped into oils, then covered with powder, embedded on a tile and placed in the oven where it is heated at around 900&nbsp;\u00b0C (1600&nbsp;\u00b0F) for one hour in an oxidizing atmosphere. The orange colored powder transforms upon heating into a transparent to yellow-colored paste, which fills all fractures. After cooling the color of the paste is fully transparent and dramatically improves the overall transparency of the ruby.<ref>Richard W.

In 1847, [[Jacques-Joseph Ebelmen|Ebelmen]] made white sapphire by fusing [[alumina]] in boric acid. In 1877, Frenic and Freil made crystal [[corundum]] from which small stones could be cut. Frimy and [[Auguste Verneuil]] manufactured artificial ruby by fusing BaF<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with a little chromium at [[Incandescence|red heat]]. In 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this [[flame fusion]] process.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|title = Bahadur: a Handbook of Precious Stones|year = 1943|accessdate = 2007-08-19|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020704/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|archivedate = September 27, 2007|df = mdy-all}}</ref> By 1910, Verneuil's laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility, with annual gemstone production having reached {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-3}} in 1907.\n\n[[Edmond Fr\u00e9my]] would later improve the crystallisation of ruby from a solution to grow larger crystals: first alongside the industrial glass-maker Charles Feil, and latterly alongside his student [[Auguste Victor Louis Verneuil|Auguste Verneuil]]. By this point Verneuil was already developing the process of [[Verneuil process|flame fusion]] that would later bear his name. Verneuil published details of his new method in 1902, at which point the industrial production of synthetic ruby could begin. By 1910, Verneuil's laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility, with annual gemstone production having reached {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-3}} in 1907.\n\nOther processes in which synthetic rubies can be produced are through Czochralski's [[Czochralski process|pulling process]], flux process, and the [[hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal process]]. Most synthetic rubies originate from flame fusion, due to the low costs involved. Synthetic rubies may have no imperfections visible to the naked eye but magnification may reveal curved [[striae]] and gas bubbles. The fewer the number and the less obvious the imperfections, the more valuable the ruby is; unless there are no imperfections (i.e., a perfect ruby), in which case it will be suspected of being artificial. [[Dopant]]s are added to some manufactured rubies so they can be identified as synthetic, but most need [[gemology|gemological]] testing to determine their origin.\n\nSynthetic rubies have technological uses as well as gemological ones. Rods of synthetic ruby are used to make [[ruby laser]]s and [[maser]]s. The first working laser was made by [[Theodore Maiman|Theodore H. Maiman]] in 1960.<ref name=\"maiman\">{{cite journal |last=Maiman |first=T.H. |authorlink=Theodore Harold Maiman |year=1960 |title=Stimulated optical radiation in ruby |journal=Nature|volume=187 |issue=4736 |pages=493\u2013494 |doi=10.1038/187493a0 |bibcode=1960Natur.187..493M}}</ref> Maiman used a solid-state light-pumped synthetic ruby to produce red laser light at a wavelength of 694 nanometers (nm). Ruby lasers are still in use. Rubies are also used in applications where high hardness is required such as at wear-exposed locations in modern mechanical clockworks, or as scanning probe tips in a [[coordinate measuring machine]].\n\n[[Imitation]] rubies are also marketed. Red [[spinel]]s, red [[garnet]]s, and colored glass have been falsely claimed to be rubies. Imitations go back to Roman times and already in the 17th century techniques were developed to color foil red\u2014by burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnace\u2014which was then placed under the imitation stone.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/nicols-history-gemstones/page_036|title = Thomas Nicols: A Lapidary or History of Gemstones|year = 1652|accessdate = 2007-08-19|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070819165714/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/nicols-history-gemstones/page_036|archivedate = August 19, 2007|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Trade terms such as [[balas ruby]] for red spinel and [[rubellite]] for red [[tourmaline]] can mislead unsuspecting buyers.

Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called [[sapphire]]s. Ruby is one of the traditional [[cardinal gem]]s, together with [[amethyst]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], and [[diamond]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218182752/https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 |date=December 18, 2017 }}, Max Bauer, p. 2</ref> The word ''ruby'' comes from ''ruber'', [[Latin]] for red. The color of a ruby is due to the element [[chromium]].\n\nSome gemstones that are popularly or historically called rubies, such as the [[Black Prince's Ruby]] in the British [[Imperial State Crown]], are actually [[spinel]]s. These were once known as \"Balas rubies\".\n\nThe quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with [[carat (mass)|carat]] weight, affect its value. The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like [[rutile]] [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] may indicate that the stone has been treated. Ruby is the traditional [[birthstone]] for July and is usually [[pink]]er than [[garnet]], although some [[rhodolite]] garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. The world's most valuable ruby is the [[Sunrise Ruby]].\n\n==Physical properties==\n[[Image:Corundum.png|thumb|left|Crystal structure of rubies]]\nRubies have a [[hardness]] of 9.0 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]. Among the natural gems only [[moissanite]] and [[diamond]] are harder, with diamond having a Mohs hardness of 10.0 and moissanite falling somewhere in between corundum (ruby) and diamond in hardness. Sapphire, ruby, and pure corundum are \u03b1-alumina, the most stable form of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, in which 3 electrons leave each aluminium [[ion]] to join the regular octahedral group of six nearby O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions; in pure corundum this leaves all of the aluminium ions with a very stable configuration of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels, and the crystal is perfectly colorless.\n\n[[Image: Ruby model.jpg|thumb|left|Crystal structure of ruby showing the substitution of Al<sup>3+</sup> ions (blue) with Cr<sup>3+</sup> (red).  The substitution density of Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions in this model is approximately 2%, approximating the maximum doping normally encountered.<ref>[https://www.miramodus.com/images.shtml Images of molecular models from Miramodus]</ref>]]\n\nWhen a chromium atom replaces an occasional aluminium atom, it too loses 3 electrons to become a chromium<sup>3+</sup> ion to maintain the charge balance of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> crystal.  However, the Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions are larger and have [[Electron configuration#Ionization of the transition metals|electron orbitals]] in different directions than aluminium. The octahedral arrangement of the O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions is distorted, and the energy levels of the different orbitals of those Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions are slightly altered because of the directions to the O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions.<ref name=causes>{{cite web | url= http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | title= Ruby: causes of color | accessdate= 28 Mar 2016 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160321193313/http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | archivedate= March 21, 2016 | df= mdy-all }}</ref> Those energy differences correspond to absorption in the ultraviolet, violet, and yellow-green regions of the spectrum.\n\n[[Image:Ruby transmittance.svg |thumb|Transmittance of ruby in optical and near-IR spectra. Note the two broad violet and yellow-green absorption bands and one narrow absorption band at the wavelength of 694 nm, which is the wavelength of the ruby laser.]]\n\nIf one percent of the aluminium ions are replaced by chromium in ruby, the yellow-green absorption results in a red color for the gem.<ref name=causes/>  Additionally, absorption at any of the above wavelengths stimulates [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] emission of 694-nanometer-wavelength red light, which adds to its red color and perceived [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]].\n\nAfter absorbing short-wavelength light, there is a short interval of time when the crystal lattice of ruby is in an excited state before fluorescence occurs. If 694-nanometer photons pass through the crystal during that time, they can stimulate more fluorescent photons to be emitted in-phase with them, thus strengthening the intensity of that red light. By arranging mirrors or other means to pass  emitted light repeatedly through the crystal, a [[ruby laser]] in this way produces a very high intensity of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] red light.\n\nAll natural rubies have imperfections in them, including color impurities and inclusions of [[rutile]] needles known as \"silk\". Gemologists use these needle inclusions found in natural rubies to distinguish them from synthetics, simulants, or substitutes. Usually, the rough stone is heated before cutting. These days, almost all rubies are treated in some form, with heat treatment being the most common practice. Untreated rubies of high quality command a large premium.\n\nSome rubies show a three-point or six-point [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] or \"star\". These rubies are cut into [[cabochons]] to display the effect properly. Asterisms are best visible with a single-light source and move across the stone as the light moves or the stone is rotated. Such effects occur when light is reflected off the \"silk\" (the structurally oriented [[rutile]] needle inclusions) in a certain way. This is one example where inclusions increase the value of a gemstone. Furthermore, rubies can show color changes\u2014though this occurs very rarely\u2014as well as [[chatoyancy]] or the \"cat's eye\" effect.\n\n===Ruby vs. pink sapphire===\nGenerally, gemstone-quality corundum in all shades of red, including pink, are called rubies.<ref name=\"matlins\">{{cite book|last=Matlins|first=Antoinette Leonard|title=Colored Gemstones|year=2010|publisher=Gemstone Press|isbn=0-943763-72-X|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502140108/https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|archivedate=May 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Peter|title=Gemmology|year=1991|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=0-7506-6449-5|page=337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102012607/https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|archivedate=January 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  However, in the United States, a minimum color saturation must be met to be called a ruby; otherwise, the stone will be called a [[sapphire|pink sapphire]].<ref name=\"matlins\" />  Drawing a distinction between rubies and pink sapphires is relatively new, having arisen sometime in the 20th century.

The most recently found ruby deposit in Myanmar is in Namya (Namyazeik) located in the northern state of [[Kachin State|Kachin]].\n\nRubies are also mined in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. In [[Azad Kashmir|Pakistani Kashmir]] there are vast proven reserves of millions of rubies, worth up to half a billion dollars.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rubies, the buried treasures of Pakistani Kashmir |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20171015-rubies-buried-treasures-pakistani-kashmir|publisher=[[France24]]}}</ref> However, as of 2017 there was only one mine (at Chitta Katha) due to lack of investment.<ref>{{cite news|author=Caroline Nelly Perrot|title=Rubies, the buried treasures of Pakistani Kashmir |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-10-rubies-treasures-pakistani-kashmir.html}}</ref> In Afghanistan, rubies are mined at Jegdalek.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The dangerous world of Pakistan\u2019s gem trade |url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/world/pakistans-blood-stones/|magazine=[[Maclean's]]}}</ref>\n\nIn Sri Lanka, lighter shades of rubies (often \"pink sapphires\") are more commonly found.\n\n==Factors affecting value==\nRubies, as with other gemstones, are graded using criteria known as the four Cs, namely color, cut, clarity and carat weight. Rubies are also evaluated on the basis of their geographic origin.\n\n'''Color:''' In the evaluation of colored gemstones, color is the most important factor. Color divides into three components: ''hue'', ''saturation'' and ''tone''. Hue refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the ''pure spectral hues'' of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.<ref name=wise>{{cite book|author=Wise, Richard W. |title=Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones |pages=18\u201322 |isbn=0-9728223-8-0 |year=2006|publisher=Brunswick House Press}}</ref> In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone, we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nImage:Ruby cristal.jpg|A naturally occurring ruby crystal\nImage:Ruby gem.JPG|Natural ruby with inclusions\nImage:Cut Ruby.jpg|A cut pink ruby\nImage:Rubis, calcite 14.jpg|Purple rubies\n</gallery>\n\n==Treatments and enhancements==\nImproving the quality of gemstones by treating them is common practice. Some treatments are used in almost all cases and are therefore considered acceptable. During the late 1990s, a large supply of low-cost materials caused a sudden surge in supply of heat-treated rubies, leading to a downward pressure on ruby prices.\n\nImprovements used include color alteration, improving transparency by dissolving rutile inclusions, healing of fractures (cracks) or even completely filling them.\n\nThe most common treatment is the application of heat. Most rubies at the lower end of the market are heat treated to improve color, remove ''purple tinge'', blue patches, and silk. These heat treatments typically occur around temperatures of 1800&nbsp;\u00b0C (3300&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref name=\"ThemelisRubyHeat\">{{cite book|isbn=0940965100|title=The Heat Treatment of Ruby and Sapphire|publisher=Gemlab Inc.|place=Bangkok, Thailand|year=1992}}</ref> Some rubies undergo a process of low tube heat, when the stone is heated over charcoal of a temperature of about 1300&nbsp;\u00b0C (2400&nbsp;\u00b0F) for 20 to 30 minutes. The silk is partially broken, and the color is improved.\n\nAnother treatment, which has become more frequent in recent years, is <!-- to avoid false positives for 'is led/lead' typo-->[[lead glass]] filling. Filling the fractures inside the ruby with lead glass (or a similar material) dramatically improves the transparency of the stone, making previously unsuitable rubies fit for applications in jewelry.<ref>Vincent Pardieu [http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf Lead Glass Filled/Repaired Rubies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831062843/http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf |date=August 31, 2011 }}. Asian Institute of Gemological Sciences Gem Testing Laboratory. February 2005</ref> The process is done in four steps:\n\n# The rough stones are pre-polished to eradicate all surface impurities that may affect the process\n# The rough is cleaned with [[hydrogen fluoride]]\n# The first heating process during which no fillers are added. The heating process eradicates impurities inside the fractures. Although this can be done at temperatures up to 1400&nbsp;\u00b0C (2500&nbsp;\u00b0F) it most likely occurs at a temperature of around 900&nbsp;\u00b0C (1600&nbsp;\u00b0F) since the rutile silk is still intact.\n# The second heating process in an electrical oven with different chemical additives. Different solutions and mixes have shown to be successful, however mostly lead-containing glass-powder is used at present. The ruby is dipped into oils, then covered with powder, embedded on a tile and placed in the oven where it is heated at around 900&nbsp;\u00b0C (1600&nbsp;\u00b0F) for one hour in an oxidizing atmosphere.

In 1847, [[Jacques-Joseph Ebelmen|Ebelmen]] made white sapphire by fusing [[alumina]] in boric acid. In 1877, Frenic and Freil made crystal [[corundum]] from which small stones could be cut. Frimy and [[Auguste Verneuil]] manufactured artificial ruby by fusing BaF<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with a little chromium at [[Incandescence|red heat]]. In 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this [[flame fusion]] process.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|title = Bahadur: a Handbook of Precious Stones|year = 1943|accessdate = 2007-08-19|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020704/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|archivedate = September 27, 2007|df = mdy-all}}</ref> By 1910, Verneuil's laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility, with annual gemstone production having reached {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-3}} in 1907.\n\n[[Edmond Fr\u00e9my]] would later improve the crystallisation of ruby from a solution to grow larger crystals: first alongside the industrial glass-maker Charles Feil, and latterly alongside his student [[Auguste Victor Louis Verneuil|Auguste Verneuil]]. By this point Verneuil was already developing the process of [[Verneuil process|flame fusion]] that would later bear his name. Verneuil published details of his new method in 1902, at which point the industrial production of synthetic ruby could begin. By 1910, Verneuil's laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility, with annual gemstone production having reached {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-3}} in 1907.\n\nOther processes in which synthetic rubies can be produced are through Czochralski's [[Czochralski process|pulling process]], flux process, and the [[hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal process]]. Most synthetic rubies originate from flame fusion, due to the low costs involved. Synthetic rubies may have no imperfections visible to the naked eye but magnification may reveal curved [[striae]] and gas bubbles. The fewer the number and the less obvious the imperfections, the more valuable the ruby is; unless there are no imperfections (i.e., a perfect ruby), in which case it will be suspected of being artificial. [[Dopant]]s are added to some manufactured rubies so they can be identified as synthetic, but most need [[gemology|gemological]] testing to determine their origin.\n\nSynthetic rubies have technological uses as well as gemological ones. Rods of synthetic ruby are used to make [[ruby laser]]s and [[maser]]s. The first working laser was made by [[Theodore Maiman|Theodore H. Maiman]] in 1960.<ref name=\"maiman\">{{cite journal |last=Maiman |first=T.H. |authorlink=Theodore Harold Maiman |year=1960 |title=Stimulated optical radiation in ruby |journal=Nature|volume=187 |issue=4736 |pages=493\u2013494 |doi=10.1038/187493a0 |bibcode=1960Natur.187..493M}}</ref> Maiman used a solid-state light-pumped synthetic ruby to produce red laser light at a wavelength of 694 nanometers (nm). Ruby lasers are still in use. Rubies are also used in applications where high hardness is required such as at wear-exposed locations in modern mechanical clockworks, or as scanning probe tips in a [[coordinate measuring machine]].\n\n[[Imitation]] rubies are also marketed. Red [[spinel]]s, red [[garnet]]s, and colored glass have been falsely claimed to be rubies. Imitations go back to Roman times and already in the 17th century techniques were developed to color foil red\u2014by burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnace\u2014which was then placed under the imitation stone.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/nicols-history-gemstones/page_036|title = Thomas Nicols: A Lapidary or History of Gemstones|year = 1652|accessdate = 2007-08-19|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070819165714/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/nicols-history-gemstones/page_036|archivedate = August 19, 2007|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Trade terms such as [[balas ruby]] for red spinel and [[rubellite]] for red [[tourmaline]] can mislead unsuspecting buyers.

Regarded as one of the best high school quarterbacks of his class, he played [[college football]] at [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]] and [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU]] and was selected by the [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St. Louis Rams]] in the sixth round of the [[2014 NFL Draft]]. He is the son of former NFL quarterback [[Gale Gilbert]].\n\nGilbert initially saw little playing time as a professional and was primarily assigned to the offseason and practice squads of his teams during his first five seasons in the NFL. He came to prominence as the starting quarterback of the [[Orlando Apollos]] of the [[Alliance of American Football]] (AAF) in 2019 where he led the league in yards and passer rating and helped his team obtain a league-best 7-1 record and playoff berth. After the AAF suspended operations before the scheduled conclusion of the season, Gilbert signed with the Browns.\n\n==High school career==\nGilbert made his first high school start during his sophomore year in the 2006 [[Texas Football Classic]], where he led the Cavaliers to a 41\u201334 victory over Texas City.

He is well known as a rock [[session musician]], predominantly as a saxophonist. He also plays keyboards, flute, [[vibraphone]] and guitar.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Osterley]], [[Middlesex]], McDonald served five years in the [[British Army]] as a bandsman. His music talent ranged from [[European classical music|classical]] orchestra to dance bands to [[rock and roll|rock]]. In 1969, he was in [[King Crimson]]'s initial line up, which recorded their first album ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]''. McDonald and drummer [[Michael Giles]] departed and formed a spin-off group that released one album titled ''[[McDonald and Giles]]''. He reappeared in King Crimson in 1974 and intended to rejoin the band as a full member but did not get the opportunity to do so given Fripp's decision to split the band.\n\nHe became a founding member of the band [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] in 1976, for whom he played guitar as well as his woodwinds and keyboards.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd \n| location= London\n| page= 318\n| id= CN 5585}}</ref> He has been a session musician and appeared in the recording of the hit single \"[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On (Bang a Gong)]]\" by [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], and recordings by Linda Lewis, Christine Harwood amongst others. He also has some production credits to his name, including albums by [[Fruupp]], Darryl Way's Wolf and Fireballet. In 1999, he released a solo album, ''Drivers Eyes''.\n\nIn 1997, the release of the King Crimson four CD set ''[[Epitaph (King Crimson album)|Epitaph]]'', consisting of rare live recordings of the 1969 version of King Crimson, renewed interest in the early Crimson material. Out of that interest, the [[21st Century Schizoid Band]] was formed in 2002 and several tours and live albums have followed. The band included former King Crimson members Michael Giles (drums and percussion), [[Peter Giles (musician)|Peter Giles]] (bass), McDonald (sax, flute, keyboards), [[Mel Collins]] (alto/tenor sax, flute, keyboards) and also [[Jakko Jakszyk]], who later joined King Crimson, on guitar and lead vocals.

[[Middlesex]]) is an English [[multi-instrumentalist|multi-instrumental]] musician, best known as a founding member of [[progressive rock]] band [[King Crimson]], formed in 1969, and of the [[hard rock]] band [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] in 1976. He is well known as a rock [[session musician]], predominantly as a saxophonist. He also plays keyboards, flute, [[vibraphone]] and guitar.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Osterley]], [[Middlesex]], McDonald served five years in the [[British Army]] as a bandsman. His music talent ranged from [[European classical music|classical]] orchestra to dance bands to [[rock and roll|rock]]. In 1969, he was in [[King Crimson]]'s initial line up, which recorded their first album ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]''. McDonald and drummer [[Michael Giles]] departed and formed a spin-off group that released one album titled ''[[McDonald and Giles]]''. He reappeared in King Crimson in 1974 and intended to rejoin the band as a full member but did not get the opportunity to do so given Fripp's decision to split the band.\n\nHe became a founding member of the band [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] in 1976, for whom he played guitar as well as his woodwinds and keyboards.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd \n| location= London\n| page= 318\n| id= CN 5585}}</ref> He has been a session musician and appeared in the recording of the hit single \"[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On (Bang a Gong)]]\" by [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], and recordings by Linda Lewis, Christine Harwood amongst others. He also has some production credits to his name, including albums by [[Fruupp]], Darryl Way's Wolf and Fireballet. In 1999, he released a solo album, ''Drivers Eyes''.\n\nIn 1997, the release of the King Crimson four CD set ''[[Epitaph (King Crimson album)|Epitaph]]'', consisting of rare live recordings of the 1969 version of King Crimson, renewed interest in the early Crimson material. Out of that interest, the [[21st Century Schizoid Band]] was formed in 2002 and several tours and live albums have followed. The band included former King Crimson members Michael Giles (drums and percussion), [[Peter Giles (musician)|Peter Giles]] (bass), McDonald (sax, flute, keyboards), [[Mel Collins]] (alto/tenor sax, flute, keyboards) and also [[Jakko Jakszyk]], who later joined King Crimson, on guitar and lead vocals. After the first tour Michael Giles was replaced with another former King Crimson drummer [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]], who has since died.\n\nMcDonald has contributed saxophone and flute to several tracks on [[Judy Dyble]]'s 2009 release, [[Talking With Strangers]]. The album sees McDonald reunited with former [[King Crimson]] bandmate [[Robert Fripp]] on the 20-minute \"Harpsong\".\n\nOn 28 July 2009, McDonald made a guest appearance with [[Asia (band)|Asia]] during their opening set for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] at the [[Tower Theater (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania)|Tower Theater]] in [[Upper Darby Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Upper Darby]], Pennsylvania, just outside of [[Philadelphia]].

One track, \"Penitentiary\" was co-written by Ian with Third International frontman, Andrew Pearson.\n\nIn 2011, McDonald began working with long-time neighbour Lynnea Benson and her husband Ted Zurkowski, directors of New York City's Frog and Peach Theatre Company, which specialises in off-Broadway productions and readings of Shakespearean plays.

He played [[college football]] for [[Penn State University]] and earned [[All-American]] honors.  He was drafted by the [[Carolina Panthers]] with the fifth overall pick of the [[1995 NFL Draft]], the first choice in the franchise's history.\n\nHe also played for the [[New Orleans Saints]], [[New York Giants]], [[Oakland Raiders]], [[Tennessee Titans]], and [[Indianapolis Colts]]. He defeated every NFL team except the [[Miami Dolphins]] during his career, and threw for over 200 touchdowns. He led the [[New York Giants]] to an appearance in [[Super Bowl XXXV]], where they lost to the [[Baltimore Ravens]] by a score of 34\u20137. He was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2018.\n\n==Early years==\nCollins was born in [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania]].  He attended [[Lebanon High School (Pennsylvania)|Lebanon High School]], until 1987, when he transferred to [[Wilson High School (Spring Township, Pennsylvania)|Wilson High School]] in [[West Lawn, Pennsylvania]], and played [[high school football|football]], [[basketball]], and [[baseball]] for the Wilson Bulldogs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lancasteronline.com/sports/football/college/penn-state-qb-and-lebanon-native-kerry-collins-makes-college/article_5b5ebb52-f48c-11e7-8e0f-073962c32d53.html |title=Penn State QB and Lebanon native Kerry Collins makes college football hall of fame |last=Gross |first=Mike |website=LancasterOnline |language=en |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nCollins attended [[Pennsylvania State University]], where he played for coach [[Joe Paterno]]'s [[Penn State Nittany Lions football]] team from 1991 to 1994.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/kerry-collins-1.html |title=Kerry Collins College Stats |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref> As a senior quarterback in 1994, he was recognized as a consensus first-team [[All-America]]n, having received first-team honors from the Associated Press, United Press International, ''The Football News'', the Football Writers Association of America, the Walter Camp Foundation and ''The Sporting News''. Collins also captured two of college football's major postseason prizes \u2014 the [[Maxwell Award]], presented to the nation's outstanding player, and the [[Davey O'Brien Award]], which goes to the nation's top quarterback.  Collins finished fourth in the [[Heisman Trophy]] balloting that year.  In addition, he was chosen UPI Back-of-the-Year and garnered Player-of-the-Year honors from ABC-TV/Chevrolet and the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Collins made a serious run at the NCAA season passing efficiency record, falling just four points short (172.8), the fourth-highest figure in NCAA annals. He broke Penn State season records for total offense (2,660), completions (176), passing yardage (2,679), completion percentage (66.7), yards per attempt (10.15) and passing efficiency (172.86). He had 14 consecutive completions at [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]], another Penn State record. Collins was the [[linchpin]] of an explosive offense that shattered 14 school records and led the nation in scoring (47.8 ppg.) and total offense (520.2 ypg.). With 5,304 career passing yards, Collins ranks third in Penn State annals and is one of only three quarterbacks to top 5,000 yards through the air. With Collins at quarterback, the [[1994 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|1994 Nittany Lions]] completed an undefeated season, the fifth under coach Joe Paterno, capped by a [[1995 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] win over [[Pac-10 Conference|Pac-10]] Champion [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon]]. His team was voted #1 by the [[New York Times]], although they were voted #2 behind undefeated [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] in the traditional polls ([[AP Poll]] and [[Coaches' Poll]]) used to determine [[NCAA Division I-A national football champions|Division 1-A champions]] prior to the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] era. In 2018, he was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Season !! Comp !! Att !! Percent !! Yards !! TD !! INT !! W !!

He was less successful in terms of wins and losses, and finished with a career total of 81 regular season wins (winning percentage of .450) and three playoff wins (winning percentage of .429).  His lone Super Bowl appearance was for the New York Giants in their loss to the Baltimore Ravens in [[Super Bowl XXXV]].  He played for a large number of professional teams, and is regarded as a [[journeyman quarterback]]. In his career, he beat 31 NFL teams; the only team he never beat was the [[Miami Dolphins]], against whom he is 0-5.\n\n===Carolina Panthers===\nCollins was selected as the [[Carolina Panthers]]' first round pick (fifth overall) in the [[1995 NFL Draft]]. <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1995/draft.htm |title=1995 NFL Draft Listing |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>He was the first player ever chosen by the Panthers in the annual college draft, though other players\u2014some [[free agents]], as well as players from the [[expansion draft]]\u2014had previously signed with the team. In his three seasons with the Panthers, he threw for 7,295 yards, 39 touchdowns, and 49 interceptions. His completion percentage was 52.6% and his [[quarterback rating]] was 65.6. In his second season, he led the Panthers to the [[NFC Championship]] Game.\n\nCollins threw 21 interceptions during the 1997 season and the Panthers finished 7\u20139, just one season after advancing to the NFC Championship.\n\nCarolina started the 1998 season with Collins as its starting quarterback. After an 0\u20134 start, Collins walked into head coach [[Dom Capers]]' office and, as Collins later put it, \"told Coach Capers my heart's not in it, I'm not happy, and I don't feel like I can play right now.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1014353/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=October 19, 1998 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> He asked to be traded, but was instead placed on waivers by Carolina during the 1998 season and subsequently signed with the [[New Orleans Saints]] to finish the season with seven more starts but only two wins.\n\nCollins would later say that he did not intend to quit the Panthers, only to sit out for a few weeks. However, Capers interpreted his request as quitting on the team and he was released. He later admitted that much of his erratic behavior was due to his struggles with alcoholism. After being arrested for drunk driving later that year, he was ordered by the NFL to seek treatment for alcohol abuse.<ref>{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Peter|authorlink=Peter King (sportswriter)|title=Renewed and revitalized at 28, Collins finally comes clean|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/peter_king/news/2001/01/22/king_collins/|accessdate=October 23, 2014|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=January 22, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010501174807/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/peter_king/news/2001/01/22/king_collins/|archivedate=May 1, 2001}}</ref>\n\n====Franchise records====\nCollins held or shared four Panthers franchise records {{as of|2017}}:\n* Passing touchdowns, rookie game (3; with [[Cam Newton]] x2)\n* Interceptions, season (21 in 1997), rookie season (19; with [[Chris Weinke]]), rookie game (4 on 1995-11-12 @STL and 1995-11-26 @NOR; with [[Chris Weinke]] and [[Cam Newton]])\n\n===New York Giants===\nCollins started the 1999 season as the Giants' second-string quarterback behind [[Kent Graham]], but claimed the starting job in Week 11 as Graham struggled with a 5\u20134 record. In the 2000 season, Collins led the Giants to [[Super Bowl XXXV]], where they lost to the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. His performance in his lone Super Bowl appearance is among the worst in [[NFL]] history. During the 2001 season, Collins set a single-season NFL record with 23 fumbles,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/randf/records/indiv/fumbles |title=NFL Records |website=www.nfl.com |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref> a record tied in 2002 by then-Minnesota Vikings quarterback [[Daunte Culpepper]]. In 2002, Collins set the Giants single season franchise passing record with 4,073 yards; the record was broken by [[Eli Manning]] in 2011. After five seasons, 68 starts and 16,875 yards, Collins was released by the Giants in 2004.<ref name=\"part ways Giants\">{{cite web|last=Best|first=Neil|title=Collins, Giants ready to part ways|url=http://buffalonews.com/editorial/20040427/1053500.asp|work=Newsday|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040501031746/http://buffalonews.com/editorial/20040427/1053500.asp|archivedate=May 1, 2004|date=April 27, 2004}}</ref>  The team had already signed former league MVP [[Kurt Warner]] and traded for 2004's #1 draft pick, Eli Manning.\n\n{{As of|2018}}, Kerry Collins held at least 7 Giants franchise records, including:\n* Most Passing Yards (playoff game): 381 (2001-01-14 MIN)\n* Most Passing TDs (playoff game): 5 (2001-01-14 MIN)\n* Most Intercepted (playoff season): 6 (2000)\n* Best Passer Rating (game): 158.3 (2002-12-22 @IND)\n* Most Pass Yds/Game (playoff career): 240.0\n* Most Pass Yds/Game (playoff season): 342.0 (2002)\n* Most 300+ yard passing games (playoffs): 2 (tied with [[Eli Manning]])\n\n===Oakland Raiders===\nAfter his release from the Giants, Collins signed a three-year, $16.82 million contract with the [[Oakland Raiders]]. Collins began the 2004 season as the team's backup to [[Rich Gannon]], but took over the starting role when Gannon suffered a neck injury in the third week of the regular season. Collins was the team's starting quarterback for the 2005 season, subsequent to Gannon's retirement.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gannon's career nears end |first=Phil |last=Barber |url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050729/NEWS/507290360/1010/SPORTS |newspaper=The Press Democrat |date=July 29, 2005 |accessdate=October 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205133421/http://www1.pressdemocrat.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050729%2FNEWS%2F507290360%2F1010%2FSPORTS |archivedate=December 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe 2005 season started off well for Collins, but he was benched after a 34\u201310 Week 12 loss to the [[San Diego Chargers]].  He was replaced by [[Marques Tuiasosopo]]. After Tuiasosopo's 26\u201310 loss at the Jets in Week 13, Collins regained his starting job in Week 14 against the [[Cleveland Browns]] (a 9\u20137 loss at home). After two seasons and a 7\u201321 record with the Raiders, Collins was cut on March 10, 2006 in what was at least partially a move designed to free space with the salary cap.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2363183 |title=Raiders cut Collins, saving $9.2 million on cap |date=2006-03-11 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n\n===Tennessee Titans===\nOn August 28, 2006, Collins agreed to a one-year contract with the [[Tennessee Titans]]. After three games, all losses for the Titans, Collins had completed fewer than half his passes, and had thrown one touchdown and six interceptions. [[Vince Young]], who played extensively as a substitute in the second game, started the fourth through sixth games while Collins saw no playing time in any of them. On March 5, 2007, he re-signed with the Titans.\n[[File:Manning Collins Pro Bowl.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Collins (right) and [[Peyton Manning]] at the [[2009 Pro Bowl]].]]\nAfter Young was injured against Jacksonville on September 7, 2008, Collins finished the game and was named the Titans starting quarterback for the rest of 2008 later that week. On September 21, 2008, Collins became the 15th player in NFL history to pass for more than 35,000 yards. Coming into the game against the [[Houston Texans]], Collins needed only 90 yards to eclipse the mark. On his ninth completion of 13 attempts, Collins completed a 17-yard pass to [[Justin McCareins]] to give him 107 yards on the day and 35,017 yards for his career.\n\nThe Titans finished the 2008 regular season with a record of 13\u20133, top seed in the playoffs, and a first round bye.

He played [[college football]] for [[Penn State University]] and earned [[All-American]] honors.  He was drafted by the [[Carolina Panthers]] with the fifth overall pick of the [[1995 NFL Draft]], the first choice in the franchise's history.\n\nHe also played for the [[New Orleans Saints]], [[New York Giants]], [[Oakland Raiders]], [[Tennessee Titans]], and [[Indianapolis Colts]]. He defeated every NFL team except the [[Miami Dolphins]] during his career, and threw for over 200 touchdowns. He led the [[New York Giants]] to an appearance in [[Super Bowl XXXV]], where they lost to the [[Baltimore Ravens]] by a score of 34\u20137. He was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2018.\n\n==Early years==\nCollins was born in [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania]].  He attended [[Lebanon High School (Pennsylvania)|Lebanon High School]], until 1987, when he transferred to [[Wilson High School (Spring Township, Pennsylvania)|Wilson High School]] in [[West Lawn, Pennsylvania]], and played [[high school football|football]], [[basketball]], and [[baseball]] for the Wilson Bulldogs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lancasteronline.com/sports/football/college/penn-state-qb-and-lebanon-native-kerry-collins-makes-college/article_5b5ebb52-f48c-11e7-8e0f-073962c32d53.html |title=Penn State QB and Lebanon native Kerry Collins makes college football hall of fame |last=Gross |first=Mike |website=LancasterOnline |language=en |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nCollins attended [[Pennsylvania State University]], where he played for coach [[Joe Paterno]]'s [[Penn State Nittany Lions football]] team from 1991 to 1994.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/kerry-collins-1.html |title=Kerry Collins College Stats |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref> As a senior quarterback in 1994, he was recognized as a consensus first-team [[All-America]]n, having received first-team honors from the Associated Press, United Press International, ''The Football News'', the Football Writers Association of America, the Walter Camp Foundation and ''The Sporting News''. Collins also captured two of college football's major postseason prizes \u2014 the [[Maxwell Award]], presented to the nation's outstanding player, and the [[Davey O'Brien Award]], which goes to the nation's top quarterback.  Collins finished fourth in the [[Heisman Trophy]] balloting that year.  In addition, he was chosen UPI Back-of-the-Year and garnered Player-of-the-Year honors from ABC-TV/Chevrolet and the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Collins made a serious run at the NCAA season passing efficiency record, falling just four points short (172.8), the fourth-highest figure in NCAA annals. He broke Penn State season records for total offense (2,660), completions (176), passing yardage (2,679), completion percentage (66.7), yards per attempt (10.15) and passing efficiency (172.86). He had 14 consecutive completions at [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]], another Penn State record. Collins was the [[linchpin]] of an explosive offense that shattered 14 school records and led the nation in scoring (47.8 ppg.) and total offense (520.2 ypg.). With 5,304 career passing yards, Collins ranks third in Penn State annals and is one of only three quarterbacks to top 5,000 yards through the air. With Collins at quarterback, the [[1994 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|1994 Nittany Lions]] completed an undefeated season, the fifth under coach Joe Paterno, capped by a [[1995 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] win over [[Pac-10 Conference|Pac-10]] Champion [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon]]. His team was voted #1 by the [[New York Times]], although they were voted #2 behind undefeated [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] in the traditional polls ([[AP Poll]] and [[Coaches' Poll]]) used to determine [[NCAA Division I-A national football champions|Division 1-A champions]] prior to the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] era. In 2018, he was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Season !! Comp !! Att !! Percent !! Yards !! TD !! INT !! W !!

He was less successful in terms of wins and losses, and finished with a career total of 81 regular season wins (winning percentage of .450) and three playoff wins (winning percentage of .429).  His lone Super Bowl appearance was for the New York Giants in their loss to the Baltimore Ravens in [[Super Bowl XXXV]].  He played for a large number of professional teams, and is regarded as a [[journeyman quarterback]]. In his career, he beat 31 NFL teams; the only team he never beat was the [[Miami Dolphins]], against whom he is 0-5.\n\n===Carolina Panthers===\nCollins was selected as the [[Carolina Panthers]]' first round pick (fifth overall) in the [[1995 NFL Draft]]. <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1995/draft.htm |title=1995 NFL Draft Listing |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>He was the first player ever chosen by the Panthers in the annual college draft, though other players\u2014some [[free agents]], as well as players from the [[expansion draft]]\u2014had previously signed with the team. In his three seasons with the Panthers, he threw for 7,295 yards, 39 touchdowns, and 49 interceptions. His completion percentage was 52.6% and his [[quarterback rating]] was 65.6. In his second season, he led the Panthers to the [[NFC Championship]] Game.\n\nCollins threw 21 interceptions during the 1997 season and the Panthers finished 7\u20139, just one season after advancing to the NFC Championship.\n\nCarolina started the 1998 season with Collins as its starting quarterback. After an 0\u20134 start, Collins walked into head coach [[Dom Capers]]' office and, as Collins later put it, \"told Coach Capers my heart's not in it, I'm not happy, and I don't feel like I can play right now.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1014353/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=October 19, 1998 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> He asked to be traded, but was instead placed on waivers by Carolina during the 1998 season and subsequently signed with the [[New Orleans Saints]] to finish the season with seven more starts but only two wins.\n\nCollins would later say that he did not intend to quit the Panthers, only to sit out for a few weeks. However, Capers interpreted his request as quitting on the team and he was released. He later admitted that much of his erratic behavior was due to his struggles with alcoholism. After being arrested for drunk driving later that year, he was ordered by the NFL to seek treatment for alcohol abuse.<ref>{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Peter|authorlink=Peter King (sportswriter)|title=Renewed and revitalized at 28, Collins finally comes clean|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/peter_king/news/2001/01/22/king_collins/|accessdate=October 23, 2014|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=January 22, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010501174807/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/peter_king/news/2001/01/22/king_collins/|archivedate=May 1, 2001}}</ref>\n\n====Franchise records====\nCollins held or shared four Panthers franchise records {{as of|2017}}:\n* Passing touchdowns, rookie game (3; with [[Cam Newton]] x2)\n* Interceptions, season (21 in 1997), rookie season (19; with [[Chris Weinke]]), rookie game (4 on 1995-11-12 @STL and 1995-11-26 @NOR; with [[Chris Weinke]] and [[Cam Newton]])\n\n===New York Giants===\nCollins started the 1999 season as the Giants' second-string quarterback behind [[Kent Graham]], but claimed the starting job in Week 11 as Graham struggled with a 5\u20134 record. In the 2000 season, Collins led the Giants to [[Super Bowl XXXV]], where they lost to the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. His performance in his lone Super Bowl appearance is among the worst in [[NFL]] history. During the 2001 season, Collins set a single-season NFL record with 23 fumbles,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/randf/records/indiv/fumbles |title=NFL Records |website=www.nfl.com |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref> a record tied in 2002 by then-Minnesota Vikings quarterback [[Daunte Culpepper]]. In 2002, Collins set the Giants single season franchise passing record with 4,073 yards; the record was broken by [[Eli Manning]] in 2011.

Collins began the 2004 season as the team's backup to [[Rich Gannon]], but took over the starting role when Gannon suffered a neck injury in the third week of the regular season.

He was replaced by [[Marques Tuiasosopo]]. After Tuiasosopo's 26\u201310 loss at the Jets in Week 13, Collins regained his starting job in Week 14 against the [[Cleveland Browns]] (a 9\u20137 loss at home). After two seasons and a 7\u201321 record with the Raiders, Collins was cut on March 10, 2006 in what was at least partially a move designed to free space with the salary cap.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2363183 |title=Raiders cut Collins, saving $9.2 million on cap |date=2006-03-11 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n\n===Tennessee Titans===\nOn August 28, 2006, Collins agreed to a one-year contract with the [[Tennessee Titans]]. After three games, all losses for the Titans, Collins had completed fewer than half his passes, and had thrown one touchdown and six interceptions. [[Vince Young]], who played extensively as a substitute in the second game, started the fourth through sixth games while Collins saw no playing time in any of them. On March 5, 2007, he re-signed with the Titans.\n[[File:Manning Collins Pro Bowl.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Collins (right) and [[Peyton Manning]] at the [[2009 Pro Bowl]].]]\nAfter Young was injured against Jacksonville on September 7, 2008, Collins finished the game and was named the Titans starting quarterback for the rest of 2008 later that week. On September 21, 2008, Collins became the 15th player in NFL history to pass for more than 35,000 yards. Coming into the game against the [[Houston Texans]], Collins needed only 90 yards to eclipse the mark. On his ninth completion of 13 attempts, Collins completed a 17-yard pass to [[Justin McCareins]] to give him 107 yards on the day and 35,017 yards for his career.\n\nThe Titans finished the 2008 regular season with a record of 13\u20133, top seed in the playoffs, and a first round bye. In the divisional round they lost to the Baltimore Ravens 13\u201310. A last minute field goal by [[Matt Stover]] won the game for the Ravens.  Collins indicated after the season that he would like to play in 2009, but only as a starter.<ref>[http://blogs.nfl.com/2009/01/12/collins-i-feel-like-im-a-starter-in-this-league/ Collins: I feel like I'm a starter in this league] NFL.com, January 13, 2009</ref> Collins replaced Jets quarterback [[Brett Favre]] in the 2009 Pro Bowl, after first alternate [[Philip Rivers]] pulled out.

Detroit selected him in the 60th round of the 1991 amateur draft, but he did not sign with the club. He was again selected in the 48th round of the 1994 amateur draft by the Toronto Blue Jays but again did not sign.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kerry Collins \u2013 BR Bullpen|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kerry_Collins|website=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Battles with alcoholism===\nBefore the 1997 season got underway, Collins's private battle with [[alcoholism]] started to make public headlines.  In a highly publicized incident, on the last night of [[Carolina Panthers]] training camp in 1997, Collins used the racial slur \"[[nigger]]\" in reference to [[African-American|black]] teammate [[Muhsin Muhammad]] while in a drunken state at a bar in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]. Supposedly, Collins also inadvertently slurred offensive lineman [[Norberto Garrido]], who is of [[Hispanic]] descent. It was widely rumored that Garrido punched Collins in the eye as a result, although this was later proven false.<ref name=\"Panthers' Collins Finds Himself Tangled Up in Racial Barbs\">{{cite news | title = Panthers' Collins Finds Himself Tangled Up in Racial Barbs | first = Mike | last = Freeman | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/24/sports/panthers-collins-finds-himself-tangled-up-in-racial-barbs.html | newspaper = New York Times | date = August 24, 1997 | accessdate = October 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn November 2, 1998, Collins was arrested for drunk driving in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Collins' DWI Case On Hold | url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/collins-dwi-case-on-hold/ | website = CBS News | date = February 15, 1999 | accessdate = December 20, 2019}}</ref> He finished the 1998 season in New Orleans and signed with the [[New York Giants]] as a free agent on February 19, 1999.<ref>{{cite news | title = Giants Sign QB Kerry Collins | url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/giants-sign-qb-kerry-collins/ | website = CBS News | date = February 19, 1999 | accessdate = December 20, 2019}}</ref>  Not long before signing with New York, Collins decided to seek treatment for his alcoholism.

As a member of the [[Tennessee Titans]], he readdressed the 1997 racial slur incident, explaining that \"The guys were talking to each other that way, and I was trying to be funny and thought I could do it, too. I was so upset by it. It was bad judgment. I could have been labeled a racist for the rest of my career. I had to live with the way I used that word with a teammate. Extremely poor judgment.

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"Voluntary non-submission.

He says the first is the type associated with [[William Godwin]] that advocates [[self-government]] with a \"progressive [[rationalism]] that included benevolence to others\". The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] as most associated with [[Max Stirner]]. The third type is \"found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution\". The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market relationships.<ref name=\"Freeden, Michael pp. 313\u2013314\"/> Individualist anarchism of different kinds have a few things in common. These are the following:\n# The concentration on the [[individual]] and their will in preference to any construction such as morality, ideology, social custom, religion, metaphysics, ideas or the will of others.<ref name=\"individualism\">\"En la vida de todo \u00fanico, todo v\u00ednculo, independientemente de la forma en que \u00e9ste se presente, supone una cadena que condiciona, y por tanto elimina la condici\u00f3n de persona libre.

First amongst these is the abstraction \"Man\", into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, \"liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God ... it sets me beneath Man.\" Indeed, he \"who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook.\" [p. 176 and p. 79] Among the many \"spooks\" Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself.

To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples. [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p.&nbsp;25] These illustrate the kinds of relationships that maximise an individual's self-enjoyment, pleasure, freedom, and individuality, as well as ensuring that those involved sacrifice nothing while belonging to them. Such associations are based on mutuality and a free and spontaneous co-operation between equals.

Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin Tucker]].<ref>Tucker, Benjamin R., \"On Picket Duty\", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881\u20131908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online p. 1</ref>\n\nProudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property\". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.\n\nProudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce and that [[monopoly|monopolies]] on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market, but without profit, which he called [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by [[Joseph Dejacque]] in the inception of anarcho-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\". An individualist rather than anarcho-communist,<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Americana\"/><ref name=\"Hamilton 1995 79\"/><ref name=\"Faguet 1970 147\"/> Proudhon said that \"communism ... is the very denial of society in its foundation\"<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph.

BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). {{ISBN|1-4264-0908-7}} p. 217</ref> and famously declared that \"[[property is theft]]!\" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.\n\nAfter Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists (who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon) and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.\n\n==== Mutualism ====\n{{socialism sidebar}}\n{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\nMutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].<ref>[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings; and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on [[green anarchism]], but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later [[Anarcho-naturism|naturist]] currents,<ref name=\"thoreau\"/> [[simple living]] as a rejection of a [[Economic materialism|materialist]] lifestyle<ref name=thoreau/> and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's goals and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]], this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.<ref name=\"naturismo\"/>\n\nThe essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] (''Resistance to Civil Government'') was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such [[acquiescence]] to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].

This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''Liberty'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, ''Liberty'' championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DdHseFmQiSUC Wendy Mcelroy. \"Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, & Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order\"]</ref>\n\nSeveral periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism.

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan.

First amongst these is the abstraction \"Man\", into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, \"liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God ... it sets me beneath Man.\" Indeed, he \"who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest.

To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples.

Such associations are based on mutuality and a free and spontaneous co-operation between equals. As Stirner puts it, \"intercourse is mutuality, it is the action, the commercium, of individuals.\" [p.&nbsp;218] Its aim is \"pleasure\" and \"self-enjoyment.\" Thus Stirner sought a broad egoism, one which appreciated others and their uniqueness, and so criticised the narrow egoism of people who forgot the wealth others are:\n:\"But that would be a man who does not know and cannot appreciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others, from the consideration shown to others.

Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin Tucker]].<ref>Tucker, Benjamin R., \"On Picket Duty\", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881\u20131908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online p. 1</ref>\n\nProudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property\". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.\n\nProudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce and that [[monopoly|monopolies]] on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market, but without profit, which he called [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by [[Joseph Dejacque]] in the inception of anarcho-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\". An individualist rather than anarcho-communist,<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Americana\"/><ref name=\"Hamilton 1995 79\"/><ref name=\"Faguet 1970 147\"/> Proudhon said that \"communism ... is the very denial of society in its foundation\"<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph.

BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). {{ISBN|1-4264-0908-7}} p. 217</ref> and famously declared that \"[[property is theft]]!\" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.\n\nAfter Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists (who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon) and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.\n\n==== Mutualism ====\n{{socialism sidebar}}\n{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\nMutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].<ref>[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called \"possession\").<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee.

Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Henry David Thoreau]]]]\n[[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817\u20131862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings; and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on [[green anarchism]], but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later [[Anarcho-naturism|naturist]] currents,<ref name=\"thoreau\"/> [[simple living]] as a rejection of a [[Economic materialism|materialist]] lifestyle<ref name=thoreau/> and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's goals and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]], this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.<ref name=\"naturismo\"/>\n\nThe essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] (''Resistance to Civil Government'') was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such [[acquiescence]] to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. The essay later influenced [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Martin Buber]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] through its advocacy of [[nonviolent resistance]].<ref name=\"ppu.org.uk\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence |title=RESISTING THE NATION STATE the pacifist and anarchist tradition by Geoffrey Ostergaard |access-date=2010-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514052437/http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence |archive-date=2011-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is also the main precedent for [[anarcho-pacifism]].<ref name=\"ppu.org.uk\"/> The American version of individualist anarchism has a strong emphasis on the [[non-aggression principle]] and [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]].<ref name=\"Madison\">{{cite journal |author=Madison, Charles A. |year=1945 |title=Anarchism in the United States |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=46\u201366 |doi=10.2307/2707055 |jstor=2707055 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |ref=harv}}</ref> Some individualist anarchists such as Thoreau<ref>Johnson, Ellwood.

A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881\u20131908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism.

This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''Liberty'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, ''Liberty'' championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DdHseFmQiSUC Wendy Mcelroy. \"Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, & Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order\"]</ref>\n\nSeveral periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism.
