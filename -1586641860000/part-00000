His mother was Charlotte Eudoxie Alida Lobjoie (1898\u20131951), daughter of Louis Joseph Alfred Lobjoie, a butcher, and his wife Marie Flore Philom\u00e8ne (Colpin) Lobjoie. According to the [[birth registry]] of his home town, Loret's father was an unidentified German soldier during [[World War I]]. Adolf Hitler had stayed in the localities of Seclin, Fournes, Wavrin, and Ardooie during the years 1916 and 1917, and, according to eyewitnesses, he supposedly had a relationship with Charlotte Lobjoie. As a result, the idea that Hitler could be Loret's father was a perennial topic of discussion.\n\nCharlotte Lobjoie was a dancer, although she apparently only took up the profession after she moved to Paris, months after the birth of Jean-Marie and the end of the war. Jean-Marie spent his first seven years with his grandparents, with whom Charlotte had no contact after moving to Paris. On 22 May 1922, Charlotte married Cl\u00e9ment Loret, a lithographer, who declared he would support his wife's illegitimate son and would allow him to bear his own last name. According to Jean-Marie, his grandparents had \"treated him badly.\" After their deaths in the mid 1920s, his aunt, Alice Lobjoie, worked to have her nephew adopted by the family of the wealthy construction magnate Frizon from Saint Quentin. From then on, Jean-Marie attended consecutively Catholic boarding schools in Cambrai and Saint Quentin.\n\nIn 1936, Jean-Marie entered the French army and was promoted over the years to staff sergeant. After [[World War II]], he was a businessman, but had to give that up in 1948 because of insolvency.\n\nLoret said he always knew that his father had been a German soldier, but he had no idea of his identity. He claimed that his mother told him in 1948, shortly before her death, that the soldier was Adolf Hitler.<ref>''Autobiographie'' [''Autobiography''], pp. 127\u2013149</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] Loret worked as ''charg\u00e9 de mission'' with the French police in [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]]. He claimed he got the job by Hitler's order, though there is nothing concrete to support this. Charges that he had collaborated with [[Gestapo]] units in France are also unproven. There were no charges of collaboration against him after the war, which makes it appear most unlikely. Loret has said that Hitler ordered all material on Loret to be destroyed. However, Loret was considered only an average individual and not overly diligent. It would have been unusual for him to have gained such a high post on his own merit when still in his early twenties.\n\nLoret was married and had nine children. Some sources claim his wife separated from him in 1948 when she learned he was Hitler's son. Some newspaper articles mention his wife as Muguette, who was still living with him at the time. It is unclear whether she was his first wife or a new one.\n\nOn 8 June 1978, during a public discussion, historian [[Werner Maser]] moved Loret to his own house in [[Speyer]], Germany, to seclude him from the intense scrutiny by the press of Loret's home in Saint-Quentin. Maser and Loret visited several places, including the former concentration camp at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], where Loret supposedly said: \"I didn't choose my father.\"\n\nMaser took Loret with him as he travelled to lecture on his parentage, even bringing him to Tokyo. However, the Frenchman was reluctant to give interviews.\n\nIn 1979, Loret and Maser had a falling-out and parted company.<ref>Brief Lorets an Frau Christine Schroeder vom 21. Juli 1979 [Loret's letter to Frau Christine Schroeder of 21 July 1979], contained in Frau Schroeder's bequest.</ref> Subsequently, Loret, in collaboration with Ren\u00e9 Mathot, published his autobiography, ''Ton p\u00e8re s'appelait Hitler'' [''Your Father's name was Hitler''] (Paris, 1981).\n\n== The Loret\u2013Hitler connection ==\nThe story of \"Hitler's son\" was first revealed to the public in the 1970s, most prominently in various illustrated magazines such as ''[[Bunte]]'', but also in more reputable publications, such as the historical journal ''Zeitgeschichte''<ref name=ZeitG1978/> and the news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.  The latter published the most influential story on Loret to date under the title \"Love in Flanders\".<ref>''Der Spiegel'', issue 45, 1977.</ref>\n\nThe ultimate origin of the story of Hitler's son, at first spread only by word of mouth, was until then not determined, although written accounts maintaining that the illegitimate son of a French girl and a German soldier was Hitler's son had already been around for a fairly long time in Loret's hometown when Loret became known to German historian Werner Maser. Whether the rumors had been put out into the world by Loret himself or by others has never been determined.  Hitler himself admitted he fathered a child, presumably Loret.  In his book ''With Hitler to the End: The Memoirs of Adolf Hitler's Valet'' (1980), Heinz Linge states that Hitler had stated to a number of people \"his belief that he had a son, born in 1918 as the result of a relationship Hitler had had with a French girl as a soldier in 1916\u20131917 in northern France and Belgium....\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Linge|first=Heinz|authorlink=Heinz Linge|title=With Hitler to the End: The Memoirs of Adolf Hitler's Valet|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1626363267}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}</ref>\n\nMaser maintained that he had heard of a reputed son of Hitler for the first time in 1965 while doing research in [[:fr:Wavrin|Wavrin]] and surrounding cities. He followed up on these reports, met Loret in the process, and was able to convince him to let the story be published. Maser exerted great effort to gather [[Proof (truth)|evidence]] to support it, however, historians including Anton Joachimsthaler<ref name=Joachimsthaller /> have criticised this, alleging that Maser was subordinating the scholarly pursuit of truth in order to pursue commercial motives such as sensationalism and enjoyment of scandal.\n\nAccording to Maser's portrayal, the Loret\u2013Hitler connection occurred as follows: Hitler had met Charlotte Lobjoie in 1916 in the city of Wavrin, in the German-occupied part of France, while stationed there as a soldier, and had begun a romantic relationship with her. Loret had been conceived in the summer of 1917 in [[Ardooie]] or, according to other sources, in the fall of 1917 in [[Le Ceteau]]. The latter scenario is the less likely variant since it would require a premature birth.\n\nMaser wrote in his Hitler biography on the relationship of Hitler and Lobjoie:\n\n<blockquote>\nAt the beginning of 1916 the young woman had met the German soldier Adolf Hitler for the first time. She stayed first in Premont, allowed herself to fall into a sexual relationship with him, and followed him until autumn 1917 to, among other places, [[Seboncourt]], Forunes, Wavrin and [[Noyelles-l\u00e8s-Seclin]] in [[Northern France]] \u2013 and, in May, June and July 1917, also to [[Ardooie]] in [[Belgium]] (p. 528).\n</blockquote>\n\nThe critics of this account pointed out that Maser had no evidence of this beyond Loret's own claims, which were secondhand at best. A genetic certification of his biological inheritance, done at the [[University of Heidelberg]], resulted in the findings that \"at best, Loret ''could'' be Hitler's son\", but that he need not be such.\n\nMaser claimed that evidence for Hitler's paternity included Charlotte Lobjoie's commitment to a French sanatorium (allegedly at Hitler's instruction) after the German invasion of France, and a protracted interrogation of Loret by the Gestapo in the [[Hotel Lutetia]], the Gestapo headquarters in [[Paris]], as well as Loret's alleged collaboration with the Gestapo as a policeman.\n\nMaser's questioning of Alice Lobjoie, Loret's aunt and Charlotte's sister, whom he had wanted to bring into play as \"crown witness\" for his claim, rendered, instead, a negative result: Alice Lobjoie stated that her sister had indeed entertained a love relationship with a German soldier, but she disputed vehemently that this soldier had been Adolf Hitler. She stated that she could remember the man's face quite well and knew that this face had no resemblance to Hitler's. In addition, she stated for the record:\n\n\"Jean is a nutcase. Only the Germans talked up that Hitler story to him.\"<ref>Joachimsthaler: ''Korrektur'' [''Emendation''], p. 62.</ref>\n\nMaser later attempted to minimize Lobjoie's statements in more recent editions of his book ''Hitler'', pointing out the aunt's alleged anger at her nephew.\n\nIn addition to Alice Lobjoie's assertion, critics of Maser's thesis, such as historian Joachimsthaler, among others, introduced into the debate testimonials from Hitler's war comrades, who, in their recollections of Hitler in the First World War, unanimously noted that he was absolutely against any relationships between German soldiers and French women. Balthasar Brandmayer for example, in his 1932 memoir ''Two Dispatch-Runners'', reported that Hitler had reacted in the most violent terms against the intent of his regiment-mates to get involved with French girls and had reproached them for having \"no German sense of honour\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Brandmayer, Balthasar |title=''Zwei Meldeg\u00e4nger.'' Mitgeteilt von Hein Bayer [Balthasar Brandmayer: ''Two Dispatch-Runners'', as told by Hein Bayer], Bruckm\u00fchl 1932, p. 103.}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the critics asserted logical inconsistencies in Maser's story: that it is highly improbable that any soldier in the war, let alone a private ranking low in the military hierarchy, would have been able to take a lover with him through all the relocations of his regiment, as Hitler had done with Lobjoie, according to Maser's account. Free movement would scarcely have been possible in the occupied areas, and having Charlotte travel along with the regiment is very doubtful.\n\nDuring the course of the 1979 Aschaffenburger Historians' [[Moot court|Moot]], Maser at first kept quiet on the matter. Finally, in his own contribution to the discussion, he abruptly declared a possible illegitimate son of Hitler to be a marginal matter.<ref>''Die Zeit'' p. 28, 7 June 1978.</ref> Joachimsthaler designated this Maser's \"own private end goal\".\n\n''[[The Daily Express]]'' claimed, in an article dated 15 February 1985, that a portrait of Loret's mother had been found, after Hitler's death, among the latter's possessions, but had no evidence for this claim. In point of fact, a portrait done by Adolf Hitler in the year 1916 that purportedly depicted Charlotte Lobjoie with head-scarf and with fork in hand was tracked to a Belgian entrepreneur in the 1960s and was published in an issue of the journal ''Panorama'' at the beginning of the 1970s. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that this same portrait was found among Hitler's possessions in 1945. One should in this case trace the origin of the claim to a misunderstanding.\n\nIn more recent time Maser reaffirmed in an [http://www.archiv.national-zeitung.de/cgi-bin/suchmausg.pl?suchw=Jean+Loret&extern=extern&kategorie=0&exakt=alle&treffer=&ref=http://www.archiv2004.national-zeitung.de/NZ30_2.html#tome1 interview] with the extreme right-wing-oriented ''[[:de:National-Zeitung \u2013 Deutsche Wochenzeitung|National-Zeitung]]'' that he stood by his thesis, just as before, and he maintained Loret \"was unambiguously Hitler's son\", and that this had been \"acknowledged in France on the part of officials\". The 12th edition of Maser's book ''Adolf Hitler: Legend, Myth, Reality'', contains an appendix on this subject.\n\n== Recent media coverage ==\n\n{{Misleading|section|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 2008 the Belgian journalist Jean-Paul Mulders travelled to Germany, Austria, France and the United States to collect DNA of the last living relatives of Hitler in Austria and on Long Island. He also obtained DNA from postcard stamps sent by Jean-Marie Loret. By comparing DNA from the stamps with that of Hitler's relatives, Mulders claimed proof that Jean-Marie Loret was not the son of Adolf Hitler. The results of his research were published in ''[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Hitler had geen joods bloed en geen Franse zoon |publisher=Het Laatste Nieuws |url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf24042008_130|date=2008-04-28|accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref> Belgium's largest newspaper. In February 2009 a book on this subject was published by [[Herbig Verlag]] in [[Munich]]: ''Auf der Suche nach Hitlers Sohn \u2013 Eine Beweisaufnahme''. The news was picked up by several international media outlets, including ''Daily Mail'', ''USA Today'', ''Bild'', ''H\u00fcrriyet'', and ''China Daily''.\n\nOn 17 February 2012, the French magazine ''[[Le Point]]'' wrote a news article, reporting that studies from the seventies by the University of Heidelberg showed Hitler and Loret were of the same [[blood group]] and that another study showed they had similar handwriting.<ref>{{cite news |title=Le fils fran\u00e7ais cach\u00e9 d'Adolf Hitler |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/exclusif-le-fils-francais-cache-d-adolf-hitler-17-02-2012-1432303_23.php |newspaper=Le Point |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}</ref> The article also stated that official German Army paperwork proves officers brought envelopes of cash to Miss Lobjoie during the World War II occupation. The magazine also described a suggestion by the family's lawyer that they may be able to claim royalties from Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. The article was repeated the same day by other international newspapers such as ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and the ''National Post'', who both misinterpreted the original article by claiming the French based their article on new studies.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Hitler had son with French teen |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9088865/Hitler-had-son-with-French-teen.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |last=Allen|first=Peter |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=24 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/17/is-jean-marie-loret-hitlers-long-lost-son/ |title=Is Jean-Marie Loret Hitler's long-lost son? |newspaper=National Post |author=Wordsworth, Araminta |date=17 February 2012|accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> According to these newspapers a revised edition of Loret's book would be published containing the 'new' findings.

Juli 1979 [Loret's letter to Frau Christine Schroeder of 21 July 1979], contained in Frau Schroeder's bequest.</ref> Subsequently, Loret, in collaboration with Ren\u00e9 Mathot, published his autobiography, ''Ton p\u00e8re s'appelait Hitler'' [''Your Father's name was Hitler''] (Paris, 1981).\n\n== The Loret\u2013Hitler connection ==\nThe story of \"Hitler's son\" was first revealed to the public in the 1970s, most prominently in various illustrated magazines such as ''[[Bunte]]'', but also in more reputable publications, such as the historical journal ''Zeitgeschichte''<ref name=ZeitG1978/> and the news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.  The latter published the most influential story on Loret to date under the title \"Love in Flanders\".<ref>''Der Spiegel'', issue 45, 1977.</ref>\n\nThe ultimate origin of the story of Hitler's son, at first spread only by word of mouth, was until then not determined, although written accounts maintaining that the illegitimate son of a French girl and a German soldier was Hitler's son had already been around for a fairly long time in Loret's hometown when Loret became known to German historian Werner Maser. Whether the rumors had been put out into the world by Loret himself or by others has never been determined.  Hitler himself admitted he fathered a child, presumably Loret.  In his book ''With Hitler to the End: The Memoirs of Adolf Hitler's Valet'' (1980), Heinz Linge states that Hitler had stated to a number of people \"his belief that he had a son, born in 1918 as the result of a relationship Hitler had had with a French girl as a soldier in 1916\u20131917 in northern France and Belgium....\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Linge|first=Heinz|authorlink=Heinz Linge|title=With Hitler to the End: The Memoirs of Adolf Hitler's Valet|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1626363267}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}</ref>\n\nMaser maintained that he had heard of a reputed son of Hitler for the first time in 1965 while doing research in [[:fr:Wavrin|Wavrin]] and surrounding cities. He followed up on these reports, met Loret in the process, and was able to convince him to let the story be published. Maser exerted great effort to gather [[Proof (truth)|evidence]] to support it, however, historians including Anton Joachimsthaler<ref name=Joachimsthaller /> have criticised this, alleging that Maser was subordinating the scholarly pursuit of truth in order to pursue commercial motives such as sensationalism and enjoyment of scandal.\n\nAccording to Maser's portrayal, the Loret\u2013Hitler connection occurred as follows: Hitler had met Charlotte Lobjoie in 1916 in the city of Wavrin, in the German-occupied part of France, while stationed there as a soldier, and had begun a romantic relationship with her. Loret had been conceived in the summer of 1917 in [[Ardooie]] or, according to other sources, in the fall of 1917 in [[Le Ceteau]]. The latter scenario is the less likely variant since it would require a premature birth.\n\nMaser wrote in his Hitler biography on the relationship of Hitler and Lobjoie:\n\n<blockquote>\nAt the beginning of 1916 the young woman had met the German soldier Adolf Hitler for the first time. She stayed first in Premont, allowed herself to fall into a sexual relationship with him, and followed him until autumn 1917 to, among other places, [[Seboncourt]], Forunes, Wavrin and [[Noyelles-l\u00e8s-Seclin]] in [[Northern France]] \u2013 and, in May, June and July 1917, also to [[Ardooie]] in [[Belgium]] (p. 528).\n</blockquote>\n\nThe critics of this account pointed out that Maser had no evidence of this beyond Loret's own claims, which were secondhand at best. A genetic certification of his biological inheritance, done at the [[University of Heidelberg]], resulted in the findings that \"at best, Loret ''could'' be Hitler's son\", but that he need not be such.\n\nMaser claimed that evidence for Hitler's paternity included Charlotte Lobjoie's commitment to a French sanatorium (allegedly at Hitler's instruction) after the German invasion of France, and a protracted interrogation of Loret by the Gestapo in the [[Hotel Lutetia]], the Gestapo headquarters in [[Paris]], as well as Loret's alleged collaboration with the Gestapo as a policeman.\n\nMaser's questioning of Alice Lobjoie, Loret's aunt and Charlotte's sister, whom he had wanted to bring into play as \"crown witness\" for his claim, rendered, instead, a negative result: Alice Lobjoie stated that her sister had indeed entertained a love relationship with a German soldier, but she disputed vehemently that this soldier had been Adolf Hitler. She stated that she could remember the man's face quite well and knew that this face had no resemblance to Hitler's. In addition, she stated for the record:\n\n\"Jean is a nutcase. Only the Germans talked up that Hitler story to him.\"<ref>Joachimsthaler: ''Korrektur'' [''Emendation''], p. 62.</ref>\n\nMaser later attempted to minimize Lobjoie's statements in more recent editions of his book ''Hitler'', pointing out the aunt's alleged anger at her nephew.\n\nIn addition to Alice Lobjoie's assertion, critics of Maser's thesis, such as historian Joachimsthaler, among others, introduced into the debate testimonials from Hitler's war comrades, who, in their recollections of Hitler in the First World War, unanimously noted that he was absolutely against any relationships between German soldiers and French women. Balthasar Brandmayer for example, in his 1932 memoir ''Two Dispatch-Runners'', reported that Hitler had reacted in the most violent terms against the intent of his regiment-mates to get involved with French girls and had reproached them for having \"no German sense of honour\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Brandmayer, Balthasar |title=''Zwei Meldeg\u00e4nger.'' Mitgeteilt von Hein Bayer [Balthasar Brandmayer: ''Two Dispatch-Runners'', as told by Hein Bayer], Bruckm\u00fchl 1932, p. 103.}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the critics asserted logical inconsistencies in Maser's story: that it is highly improbable that any soldier in the war, let alone a private ranking low in the military hierarchy, would have been able to take a lover with him through all the relocations of his regiment, as Hitler had done with Lobjoie, according to Maser's account. Free movement would scarcely have been possible in the occupied areas, and having Charlotte travel along with the regiment is very doubtful.\n\nDuring the course of the 1979 Aschaffenburger Historians' [[Moot court|Moot]], Maser at first kept quiet on the matter. Finally, in his own contribution to the discussion, he abruptly declared a possible illegitimate son of Hitler to be a marginal matter.<ref>''Die Zeit'' p. 28, 7 June 1978.</ref> Joachimsthaler designated this Maser's \"own private end goal\".\n\n''[[The Daily Express]]'' claimed, in an article dated 15 February 1985, that a portrait of Loret's mother had been found, after Hitler's death, among the latter's possessions, but had no evidence for this claim. In point of fact, a portrait done by Adolf Hitler in the year 1916 that purportedly depicted Charlotte Lobjoie with head-scarf and with fork in hand was tracked to a Belgian entrepreneur in the 1960s and was published in an issue of the journal ''Panorama'' at the beginning of the 1970s. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that this same portrait was found among Hitler's possessions in 1945. One should in this case trace the origin of the claim to a misunderstanding.\n\nIn more recent time Maser reaffirmed in an [http://www.archiv.national-zeitung.de/cgi-bin/suchmausg.pl?suchw=Jean+Loret&extern=extern&kategorie=0&exakt=alle&treffer=&ref=http://www.archiv2004.national-zeitung.de/NZ30_2.html#tome1 interview] with the extreme right-wing-oriented ''[[:de:National-Zeitung \u2013 Deutsche Wochenzeitung|National-Zeitung]]'' that he stood by his thesis, just as before, and he maintained Loret \"was unambiguously Hitler's son\", and that this had been \"acknowledged in France on the part of officials\". The 12th edition of Maser's book ''Adolf Hitler: Legend, Myth, Reality'', contains an appendix on this subject.\n\n== Recent media coverage ==\n\n{{Misleading|section|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 2008 the Belgian journalist Jean-Paul Mulders travelled to Germany, Austria, France and the United States to collect DNA of the last living relatives of Hitler in Austria and on Long Island. He also obtained DNA from postcard stamps sent by Jean-Marie Loret. By comparing DNA from the stamps with that of Hitler's relatives, Mulders claimed proof that Jean-Marie Loret was not the son of Adolf Hitler. The results of his research were published in ''[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Hitler had geen joods bloed en geen Franse zoon |publisher=Het Laatste Nieuws |url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf24042008_130|date=2008-04-28|accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref> Belgium's largest newspaper. In February 2009 a book on this subject was published by [[Herbig Verlag]] in [[Munich]]: ''Auf der Suche nach Hitlers Sohn \u2013 Eine Beweisaufnahme''. The news was picked up by several international media outlets, including ''Daily Mail'', ''USA Today'', ''Bild'', ''H\u00fcrriyet'', and ''China Daily''.\n\nOn 17 February 2012, the French magazine ''[[Le Point]]'' wrote a news article, reporting that studies from the seventies by the University of Heidelberg showed Hitler and Loret were of the same [[blood group]] and that another study showed they had similar handwriting.<ref>{{cite news |title=Le fils fran\u00e7ais cach\u00e9 d'Adolf Hitler |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/exclusif-le-fils-francais-cache-d-adolf-hitler-17-02-2012-1432303_23.php |newspaper=Le Point |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}</ref> The article also stated that official German Army paperwork proves officers brought envelopes of cash to Miss Lobjoie during the World War II occupation. The magazine also described a suggestion by the family's lawyer that they may be able to claim royalties from Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. The article was repeated the same day by other international newspapers such as ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and the ''National Post'', who both misinterpreted the original article by claiming the French based their article on new studies.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Hitler had son with French teen |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9088865/Hitler-had-son-with-French-teen.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |last=Allen|first=Peter |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=24 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/17/is-jean-marie-loret-hitlers-long-lost-son/ |title=Is Jean-Marie Loret Hitler's long-lost son? |newspaper=National Post |author=Wordsworth, Araminta |date=17 February 2012|accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> According to these newspapers a revised edition of Loret's book would be published containing the 'new' findings.

Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned without restrictions regarding county boundaries.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]], the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]], the [[American Party (1969)|Courage Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Free Libertarian Party]], the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]] and the [[U.S. Labor Party|Labor Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York state election, 1974]], was held on November 5. Congressman [[Hugh Carey]] and State Senator [[Mary Anne Krupsak]] were elected Governor and Lieutenant Governor, both Democrats. Carey defeated the incumbent Governor [[Malcolm Wilson (governor)|Malcolm Wilson]]. The elections to the other five statewide elective offices resulted in a Republican Attorney General with Liberal endorsement; a Democratic State Comptroller with Liberal endorsement; a Republican U.S. Senator with Liberal endorsement; and two Democratic judges of the Court of Appeals, one of them with Liberal endorsement. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats/Liberals 3,029,000; Republicans/Conservatives 2,220,000; Courage 12,500; Free Libertarians 10,500; Socialist Workers 9,000; Communists 5,000; Socialist Labor 4,500; and Labor 3,000. Gathering from the results for the other offices, the strength of the Liberals was about 400,000 votes, and the Conservatives about 250,000. However, Conservative Barbara A.

Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned without restrictions regarding county boundaries.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]], the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]], the [[American Party (1969)|Courage Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Free Libertarian Party]], the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]] and the [[U.S. Labor Party|Labor Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York state election, 1974]], was held on November 5. Congressman [[Hugh Carey]] and State Senator [[Mary Anne Krupsak]] were elected Governor and Lieutenant Governor, both Democrats. Carey defeated the incumbent Governor [[Malcolm Wilson (governor)|Malcolm Wilson]]. The elections to the other five statewide elective offices resulted in a Republican Attorney General with Liberal endorsement; a Democratic State Comptroller with Liberal endorsement; a Republican U.S. Senator with Liberal endorsement; and two Democratic judges of the Court of Appeals, one of them with Liberal endorsement. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats/Liberals 3,029,000; Republicans/Conservatives 2,220,000; Courage 12,500; Free Libertarians 10,500; Socialist Workers 9,000; Communists 5,000; Socialist Labor 4,500; and Labor 3,000. Gathering from the results for the other offices, the strength of the Liberals was about 400,000 votes, and the Conservatives about 250,000. However, Conservative Barbara A. Keating polled more than 800,000 votes for U.S. Senator.\n\nOf the seven women members of the previous legislature, State Senator [[Mary Anne Krupsak]] (Dem.), a lawyer of [[Amsterdam (city), New York|Amsterdam]], was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of New York]], and became ''ex officio'' President of the State Senate; and five of the other six\u2014State Senators [[Karen Burstein]], a lawyer of [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]], and [[Carol Bellamy]], a lawyer of [[Brooklyn]]; and Assemblywomen [[Elizabeth Connelly]] (Dem.), of [[Staten Island]]; [[Estella B. Diggs]], of [[the Bronx]]; and [[Rosemary R. Gunning]] (Cons.), a lawyer of [[Ridgewood, Queens]]\u2014were re-elected. [[Linda Winikow]], of [[Spring Valley, New York|Spring Valley]], was also elected to the State Senate. [[Jean Amatucci]] (Dem.), a registered nurse of [[White Lake, New York|White Lake]]; [[Mary B. Goodhue]] (Rep.), a lawyer of [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisco]]; and [[Marie M. Runyon]] (Dem.), of [[Manhattan]], were also elected to the Assembly.\n\nThe New York state election, 1975, was held on November 4. No statewide elective offices were up for election. One vacancy was filled in the Legislature: [[Jeannette Gadson]], of [[Brooklyn]], was elected to the Assembly.\n\nOn February 10, 1976, [[Gerdi E. Lipschutz]] (Dem.), of [[Queens]], was elected to fill a vacancy in the Assembly, making her the eleventh woman member of the Legislature of 1976, surpassing the previous record of eight in the [[166th New York State Legislature]] (1947\u20131948).\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the first regular session (the 198th) at the State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 8, 1975; and adjourned ''sine die'' in the morning of July 12.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/13/archives/legislature-increases-aid-for-elderly-longest-session-since-1911-is.html ''Longest Session Since 1911 Is Ended''] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on July 13, 1975 (subscription required)</ref>\n\n[[Stanley Steingut]] (Dem.) was elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]].\n\n[[Warren M.

The Lakers would beat the Celtics 112-104.\n\n===2010s: Roles reversed===\nBoth the Celtics and Lakers missed the playoffs in the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], marking only the second time it has happened in the rivalry's history.  With the [[New York Knicks]] also failing to make the playoffs that season, it marked the first time in NBA history that neither the Celtics, Lakers nor the Knicks qualified for the playoffs in the same season.\n\nBut while the Celtics were able to return to the playoffs over the next three seasons and even made the Eastern Conference Finals in [[2017 NBA playoffs|2017]] and [[2018 NBA playoffs|2018]], the Lakers found themselves in a lengthy rebuilding process. Prior to 2014, the Lakers only missed the playoffs four times since moving to Los Angeles, and five times in franchise history.  However, the Lakers proceeded to miss the playoffs a record six consecutive seasons, highlighted by four straight seasons with over 50 losses and a franchise-low 17\u201365 mark during the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].\n\nNevertheless, the rivalry between the Celtics and the Lakers remained fairly even during this recent period, with the two teams managing a split in the season series four of the last six times. However, battles between the Celtics and the Lakers took a back seat to the emerging [[Cavaliers\u2013Warriors rivalry|rivalry]] between the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and the [[Golden State Warriors]], who met in four consecutive NBA Finals between 2015 and 2018, where the Cavaliers were led by a big three of [[LeBron James]], [[Kyrie Irving]], and [[Kevin Love]], while the Warriors were led by a big four of [[Stephen Curry]], [[Kevin Durant]], [[Klay Thompson]], and [[Draymond Green]].\n\nNotwithstanding the Celtics' success and the Lakers' struggles during this period, both teams would make their presence felt in subsequent offseasons. The Lakers' run of futility rewarded them with several high first-round picks ([[D'Angelo Russell]], [[Brandon Ingram]] and [[Lonzo Ball]] were selected second overall), while the Celtics benefited from the [[Brooklyn Nets]]' ill-fated 2013 trade for Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett with their top-three selections of [[Jaylen Brown]] and [[Jayson Tatum]]. In addition, the Celtics went on to sign All-Star free agents [[Al Horford]] and [[Gordon Hayward]] in addition to acquiring Kyrie Irving from the Cavaliers. The Lakers would counter by signing LeBron James in the 2018 offseason. The two teams continued to retool in the 2019 offseason; the Lakers acquired [[Anthony Davis]] from the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] while the Celtics brought in [[Kemba Walker]] after Irving left to join the Nets.\n\n==Finals summaries==\n===1959 NBA Finals===\n{{Main|1959 NBA Finals}}\nThis was the first NBA Finals series between the Lakers and the Celtics, and the only such meeting to occur while the Lakers were still in Minneapolis.

Boston would face a tough seven-game series against the [[Syracuse Nationals]] but would eventually emerge victorious, leading Celtic star [[Bob Cousy]] to predict that Boston would sweep Minneapolis.

The Celtics won Game 1, and the two teams would alternate victories through Game 5.  Game 5 was notable for an impressive Lakers' comeback sending it into overtime, but the Celtics would ultimately win that game. In Game 6, the Celtics closed out the Lakers in convincing fashion with a 124\u2013109 victory.<ref name=1968Finals/>\n\n===1969 NBA Finals===\n{{Main|1969 NBA Finals}}\nWith Bill Russell and Sam Jones in their final season, and plagued with injuries, the Celtics struggled to make the NBA playoffs as the fourth and final seed in the Eastern Conference.

However, they won Game 3 and a buzzer-beater by Sam Jones tied the series up at two games apiece. The home team won Games 5 and 6 which set up a dramatic seventh game.

Remarkably, Boston would pull away and entered the fourth quarter up by 18. It seemed to be over when Lakers center Wilt Chamberlain was injured and replaced by reserve [[Mel Counts]]. The Celtics, however, would begin to show their age when they began missing shots and turning the ball over and Laker Jerry West pulled L.A. to within one. Despite having numerous opportunities, the Lakers couldn't get over the hump and Don Nelson would make an incredible foul-line jump-shot which bounced off the back iron and fell in. During this, another battle was heating up off the court between Jack Kent Cooke and Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff. Chamberlain was pleading for Breda Kolff to put him back in, but he refused.

The Lakers would beat the Celtics 112-104.\n\n===2010s: Roles reversed===\nBoth the Celtics and Lakers missed the playoffs in the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], marking only the second time it has happened in the rivalry's history.  With the [[New York Knicks]] also failing to make the playoffs that season, it marked the first time in NBA history that neither the Celtics, Lakers nor the Knicks qualified for the playoffs in the same season.\n\nBut while the Celtics were able to return to the playoffs over the next three seasons and even made the Eastern Conference Finals in [[2017 NBA playoffs|2017]] and [[2018 NBA playoffs|2018]], the Lakers found themselves in a lengthy rebuilding process. Prior to 2014, the Lakers only missed the playoffs four times since moving to Los Angeles, and five times in franchise history.  However, the Lakers proceeded to miss the playoffs a record six consecutive seasons, highlighted by four straight seasons with over 50 losses and a franchise-low 17\u201365 mark during the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].\n\nNevertheless, the rivalry between the Celtics and the Lakers remained fairly even during this recent period, with the two teams managing a split in the season series four of the last six times. However, battles between the Celtics and the Lakers took a back seat to the emerging [[Cavaliers\u2013Warriors rivalry|rivalry]] between the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and the [[Golden State Warriors]], who met in four consecutive NBA Finals between 2015 and 2018, where the Cavaliers were led by a big three of [[LeBron James]], [[Kyrie Irving]], and [[Kevin Love]], while the Warriors were led by a big four of [[Stephen Curry]], [[Kevin Durant]], [[Klay Thompson]], and [[Draymond Green]].\n\nNotwithstanding the Celtics' success and the Lakers' struggles during this period, both teams would make their presence felt in subsequent offseasons. The Lakers' run of futility rewarded them with several high first-round picks ([[D'Angelo Russell]], [[Brandon Ingram]] and [[Lonzo Ball]] were selected second overall), while the Celtics benefited from the [[Brooklyn Nets]]' ill-fated 2013 trade for Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett with their top-three selections of [[Jaylen Brown]] and [[Jayson Tatum]]. In addition, the Celtics went on to sign All-Star free agents [[Al Horford]] and [[Gordon Hayward]] in addition to acquiring Kyrie Irving from the Cavaliers. The Lakers would counter by signing LeBron James in the 2018 offseason. The two teams continued to retool in the 2019 offseason; the Lakers acquired [[Anthony Davis]] from the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] while the Celtics brought in [[Kemba Walker]] after Irving left to join the Nets.\n\n==Finals summaries==\n===1959 NBA Finals===\n{{Main|1959 NBA Finals}}\nThis was the first NBA Finals series between the Lakers and the Celtics, and the only such meeting to occur while the Lakers were still in Minneapolis.

The Celtics won Game 1, and the two teams would alternate victories through Game 5.

Remarkably, Boston would pull away and entered the fourth quarter up by 18. It seemed to be over when Lakers center Wilt Chamberlain was injured and replaced by reserve [[Mel Counts]]. The Celtics, however, would begin to show their age when they began missing shots and turning the ball over and Laker Jerry West pulled L.A. to within one. Despite having numerous opportunities, the Lakers couldn't get over the hump and Don Nelson would make an incredible foul-line jump-shot which bounced off the back iron and fell in. During this, another battle was heating up off the court between Jack Kent Cooke and Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff. Chamberlain was pleading for Breda Kolff to put him back in, but he refused.

The sporting goods company {{nihongo|SCRTC|\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30c1|Sukuratchi|extra=pronounced like the English word [[wikt:scratch|scratch]]}} serves as a front for the martial arts school, specifically its Gekirangers.\n\n===Gekirangers===\nWhen transformed into the Gekirangers, the group says {{nihongo|\"Our blazing Geki is the proof of justice!

He was the sole survivor of Long's attack on his village, blocking his memories of the incident and becoming a [[feral child]] raised by tigers in the forest outside the {{nihongo|Beast Origin Village|\u7363\u6e90\u90f7|J\u016bgenky\u014d}}. Long had intended to kill Jyan due to his lineage, as the son of Dan, which enhances his sense of qi. Master Xia Fu began training Jyan as he personifies the {{nihongo|\"Body\"|\u4f53|Tai|also pronounced as ''Karada''}} of a Gekiranger: resistance to most forms of pain. His vocabulary is limited and he uses Jyan-ish phrases such as \"niki-niki\", \"zowa-zowa\", and \"waki-waki\", and has to learn about the \"Heart\". Jyan is eventually labeled as Rio's rival after witnessing the display of power used to stop his own attack. He becomes Sharkie Chan's first student of the {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Shark]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30af\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Sh\u0101kuken}} sword-fighting style. Though Jyan possesses the {{nihongo|Kageki|\u904e\u6fc0\u6c17|Kageki}}, he is unable to fully use it in his first fight with Rio.\n\nJyan is criticized for practising Geki J\u016bken to become stronger, a flawed ideology like Rio's, but he later realizes that his true reason to fight is to protect others. With this revelation he is able to transform into {{nihongo|Super Geki Red|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b2\u30ad\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|S\u016bp\u0101 Geki Reddo}}, using the {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Gorilla]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30b4\u30ea\u30e9\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Goriraken}} style and is the {{nihongo|\"Extremely Unbreakable Body\"|\u300c\u904e\u6fc0\u306b\u30a2\u30f3\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30ab\u30d6\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u300d|Kageki ni Anbureikaburu Bodi}}.\n\nJyan stops fighting after learning of his past with Rio and Dan, but with Xia Fu's help resumes his role as a Gekiranger, making an enemy out of Long. When Jyan regains his memories, he vows to make Long pay for his wrongdoings and beats sense into Rio. Rio then joins Jyan to save Mere and work together against their mutual enemy. After Long's defeat, Jyan invites both Rio and Mere to SCRTC, but is unable to convince Rio and Mere to not undertake the Fist Judgment to cleanse themselves of their sins. In memory of Rio, Jyan wears the Kenmas' Bracelet and vows to destroy Long.\n\nDuring the final battle, after being infused with Maku's Rinki, the Gekirangers are taken to an astral Rin J\u016b Hall, where they are met by Rio and Mere. Jyan masters the {{nihongo|Rin J\u016b [[Bear]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30d9\u30a2\u30fc\u62f3|Rinj\u016b Be\u0101ken}} style, unifying both Geki J\u016b and Rin J\u016b styles. With their newfound skills, the Gekirangers defeat Long, sealing him in a small ball, which Jyan keeps to ensure Long's power never falls into the wrong hands. He then leaves SCRTC to travel the world to find the next generation of Juken fighters. While teaching the Beast Fist to children in Hong Kong, he runs into a boy who looks similar to Rio and decides to take him under his wing. Returning to Japan, Jyan is ambushed by Nuchaku Banki before he, Ran, and Retsu are trapped in the subspace before the Go-ongers come to their aid. After his new friends lost their engines, and being tricked into giving away the sealed Long, Jyan helps S\u014dsuke train and develop his own Firece Ki before Long is able to fully manifest. With the aid of a revived Rio, Long is defeated and Jyan reaffirms his vow with Rio to become stronger.\n\nJyan is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Hiroki Suzuki (born 1983)|Hiroki Suzuki]]|\u9234\u6728 \u88d5\u6a39|Suzuki Hiroki}}. As a child, he is portrayed by {{nihongo|Arashi Fukasawa|\u6df1\u6fa4 \u5d50|Fukasawa Arashi}}.\n\n====Ran Uzaki====\n{{nihongo|Ran Uzaki/Geki Yellow|\u5b87\u5d0e \u30e9\u30f3\uff0f\u30b2\u30ad\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc|Uzaki Ran/Geki Ier\u014d}} is an employee of SCRTC and a {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Cheetah]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30c1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Ch\u012bt\u0101ken}} artist, using a combination of [[Wing Chun]] speed and accuracy in her attacks. Ran comes from a high-class family that owns a gym, and to ensure her future her mother Reiko wished her to leave SCRTC when she came of age for marriage. Ran is initially reluctant because she does not think she is good enough to learn the Beast Arts. She relies more on will than technique when fighting, and always tries to do things the right way, being a fighter that gives {{nihongo|\"Heart\"|\u5fc3|Shin|also pronounced as ''Kokoro''}} the highest place. She excels in speed, but her reluctance to care for the small details make her \"Technique\" very poor. From learning Master Elehung Kam-Bo's {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Elephant]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30a8\u30ec\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Erefantoken}} [[meteor hammer]] techniques, Ran became more relaxed and happy in the process.\n\nRan competes with Michelle Peng in a skateboarding competition to improve her \"Technique\" to obtain Kageki. This training allows her to become {{nihongo|Super Geki Yellow|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b2\u30ad\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc|S\u016bp\u0101 Geki Ier\u014d}}. As Super Geki Yellow she uses the {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Penguin]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30da\u30f3\u30ae\u30f3\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Penginken}} style and is the {{nihongo|\"Extremely Honest Heart\"|\u300c\u904e\u6fc0\u306b\u30aa\u30cd\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8\u300d|Kageki ni Onesuto H\u0101to}}. Soon after, Ran is appointed as team captain of the Gekirangers by Xia Fu.\n\nDuring the final battle, Ran is infused with Kata's Rinki, and is brought to an astral Rin J\u016b Hall to master the {{nihongo|Rin J\u016b [[Hawk]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30db\u30fc\u30af\u62f3|Rinj\u016b H\u014dkuken}} style to seal Long. Three months after Long's defeat, she is seen alongside Retsu teaching Juken to young children at SCRTC.\n\nRan is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Mina Fukui]]|\u798f\u4e95 \u672a\u83dc|Fukui Mina}}.\n\n====Retsu Fukami====\n{{nihongo|Retsu Fukami/Geki Blue|\u6df1\u898b \u30ec\u30c4\uff0f\u30b2\u30ad\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc|Fukami Retsu/Geki Bur\u016b}} is an employee of SCRTC and a {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Jaguar]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30b8\u30e3\u30ac\u30fc\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Jag\u0101ken}} practitioner, using [[Piguaquan]] martial-arts techniques. When he was a child his older brother Gou was killed, leaving him with a hatred for Rio who was said to be responsible. He set aside an artistic career to study the same fighting style as Gou, in order to move past his desire for revenge. Retsu is initially intelligent but selfish, does not take interest in others, and gives an impression of extreme coldness. He believes that winning should be like a painting, complete and inspirational. He sometimes mixes English loanwords in his speech. He learns of moving sensation of a trance{{clarify|date=November 2018}} when he masters Bat Li's {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Bat]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30d0\u30c3\u30c8\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Battoken}} style. He prioritizes {{nihongo|\"Techniques\"|\u6280|Gi|also pronounced as ''Waza''}} in his training. His attention to beauty costs him stamina, making his \"Body\" his weakest point until he beats Bion Biao in an endurance match to obtain Kageki, and becomes {{nihongo|Super Geki Blue|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b2\u30ad\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc|S\u016bp\u0101 Geki Bur\u016b}}. As Super Geki Blue, he uses the {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Gazelle]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30ac\u30bc\u30eb\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Gazeruken}} style and the {{nihongo|\"Extremely Fantastic Technique\"|\u300c\u904e\u6fc0\u306b\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u300d|Kageki ni Fantasutikku Tekunikku}}.\n\nDuring the final battle, Retsu is infused with Rageku's Rinki, and is brought to an astral Rin J\u016b Hall to master the {{nihongo|Rin J\u016b [[Jellyfish|Jelly]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30b8\u30a7\u30ea\u30fc\u62f3|Rinj\u016b Jer\u012bken}} style to seal Long. Three months after Long's defeat, he is seen alongside Ran teaching the Beast Fist to young children at SCRTC.\n\nRetsu is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Manpei Takagi]]|\u9ad8\u6728 \u4e07\u5e73|Takagi Manpei}}. As a child and a baby, he is portrayed by {{nihongo|Nao Fujisaki|\u85e4\u5d0e \u76f4|Fujisaki Nao}} and {{nihongo|Sora Kitajima|\u5317\u5cf6 \u7a7a|Kitajima Sora}}.\n\n====Gou Fukami====\n{{nihongo|Gou Fukami/Geki Violet|\u6df1\u898b \u30b4\u30a6\uff0f\u30b2\u30ad\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8|Fukami G\u014d/Geki Baioretto|22\u201349}} is the fourth member and a {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Wolf]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Urufuken}} user, a student alongside Rio and Miki. He is Retsu's protective older brother. After their parents died they were taken in by a church. Gou forced Retsu to promise never to take on the Juken, then went to face Rio. Gou used an imperfect form of the forbidden Geki Waza in an attempt to defeat and seal Rio, but it failed and Gou wandered for fifteen years in a [[werewolf]] form that he could not control.\n\nOnce regaining his human form, Gou was shocked at how much had changed and that Retsu was practising Geki J\u016bken. Though he is of the Geki J\u016bken, Gou lacks a passion for justice and fights only for himself. This resulted in Gou developing and mastering a dangerous form of Geki, called {{nihongo|Shigeki|\u7d2b\u6fc0\u6c17\uff08\u3057\u3052\u304d\uff09||\"Violet Fierce Qi\"}}, and reinventing the Wolf-Ken as his personal {{nihongo|Fukami-Style|\u6df1\u898b\u6d41|Fukamiry\u016b}}, a form that uses [[Muay Thai]] fighting moves. Xia Fu believed that Gou actually does have a passion for justice, and commissioned the GongChanger for Gou to use. After much soul searching and cajoling by the others, he agrees to become Geki Violet and overcomes the beast within him thanks to Bae.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maruzen-toy.com/cgi-bin/goods.cgi?id=SH-276|title=\u4e38\u5584\u5546\u5e97\u3000\u4e88\u7d0405/27\u3006\u3010\u30d0\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u3011\u7363\u62f3\u6226\u968a\u30b2\u30ad\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc \u6226\u968a\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba \uff17 \u30b2\u30ad\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u5546\u54c1\u8aac\u660e|accessdate=2007-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006161326/http://www.maruzen-toy.com/cgi-bin/goods.cgi?id=SH-276#|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ameba.jp/2007/07/5811.php|title=\u6620\u753b\u7248\u30b2\u30ad\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u3067\u6b63\u7fa9\u3068\u60aa\u306e\u5922\u306e\u7af6\u6f14\uff5cAmeba News|accessdate=2007-07-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717182400/http://news.ameba.jp/2007/07/5811.php|archivedate=2007-07-17}}</ref> Using his Shigeki, Gou can summon Geki Tiger and Geki Jaguar and control Geki Tohja Wolf on his own. Gou desires to defeat Rio and prove himself as his rival, holding some animosity towards Jyan in this regard, but accepts that he is not up to the task after mastering the strongest Geki Waza but still failing to defeat Rio. He is later glad when Rio joins the fight against Long.\n\nDuring the final battle, Gou is among the other Geki J\u016bken warriors, including the Kensei, keeping Long at bay until Jyan, Ran, and Retsu return. After the battle is over, Gou sets upon his own journey with Bae to atone for his actions as a werewolf.\n\nGou is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Riki Miura]]|\u4e09\u6d66 \u529b|Miura Riki}}.\n\n====Ken Hisatsu====\n{{nihongo|Ken Hisatsu/Geki Chopper|\u4e45\u6d25 \u30b1\u30f3\uff0f\u30b2\u30ad\u30c1\u30e7\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Hisatsu Ken/Geki Chopp\u0101|27-49}} is the fifth member of the Gekiranger team, colored white with orange accents in a suit that resembles a [[karate uniform]]. He is a prodigy who trained at the Beast Origin Village and mastered one of the oldest fighting styles in the Beast Arts, the {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[White Rhinoceros|Rhinoceros]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30e9\u30a4\u30ce\u30bb\u30e9\u30b9\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Rainoserasuken}}, to overcome the pain of losing his mother at a young age. Ken was originally to aid Ran and Retsu, but travelled abroad since his Geki Changer was broken. He also sold the SoZyuTo that Xia Fu gave him for travelling money. He is a free spirit, and does not restrict himself by talent or ties to the Geki J\u016bken. Ken can utilize the {{nihongo|Geki Hard Diamond|\u6fc0\u6c17\u7814\u947d|Geki Kensan}}, a karate technique in which he condenses his Geki into a diamond blade on his hand with which can cut through anything. He eventually manifested Kageki on Christmas Eve out of his passion for the holidays. He frequently uses the word {{nihongo|\"Ossu\"|\u62bc\u5fcd}}, which is [[karate]] term meaning \"patience with myself and others\". He also uses \"kenzan\", an archaic Japanese word that means \"just arrived\" and is also a pun on his name, Ken. Using the SoZyuTo, he can summon and control SaiDain/SaiDaiOh. ''Hisatsu ken'' can also translate as \"hidden technique\", which Ken has. After the final battle is over, Ken returns to work at SCRTC Meisters.\n\nKen is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Sotaro]]|\u8061\u592a\u90ce|S\u014dtar\u014d|Sotaro Yasuda}}.\n\n===Allies===\n\n====Miki Masaki====\n{{nihongo|Miki Masaki|\u771f\u54b2 \u7f8e\u5e0c|Masaki Miki}} is head of SCRTC's special development department and responsible for designing most of the Gekiranger's weapons.

She dislikes Elehung, despite his attraction to her. Before training in Geki J\u016bken, Miki was an infamous ''[[sukeban]]'' (female gangleader) in her youth, former leader of the Kanto Sukeban Alliance. She also knows and meets [[Search Guard Successor Foundation#Other SGS Members|SGS' Morio Makino]] and [[The Go-ongers#Hant J\u014d|Hant J\u014d]] from the [[Bakuryu Sentai Abaranger|Dino House]] she usually eats at.\n\nMiki is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Kazue Itoh]]|\u4f0a\u85e4 \u304b\u305a\u3048|It\u014d Kazue}}.\n\n====The Seven Kensei====\nThe {{nihongo|Seven Kensei|\u4e03\u62f3\u8056|Shichi Kensei|\"Kensei\" literally translates as \"Fist Sage\"}} are the legendary creators of the Geki J\u016bken style, originally under the wing of Brusa Ee. When three fellow students split away to found the Rin J\u016bken as [[Rin J\u016bken Akugata#The Three Kenma|Three Kenma]], killing Brusa Ee, the two groups battled in the Geki-Rin Rebellion. This ended with the Kensei using a forbidden Geki Waza that sealed the Kenmas' bodies while forcing the seven Kensei into their animal forms. They swore a Juken Oath of [[nonviolence]] soon after, fighting only in defense. Among them are the creators of the three Geki J\u016bken weapon styles that utilize one's heart and the [[meteor hammer]], one's technique and the [[war fan]], and one's body with [[saber]]s. Three others make up the {{nihongo|Master Triangle|\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb|Masut\u0101 Toraianguru}}, three Kensei who had each fully mastered one of the three major aspects of the Geki J\u016bken Beast Arts: Heart, Technique, and Body. The seventh Kensei, Xia Fu, mastered all three aspects of the Beast Arts and thus is the strongest of the Kensei. While it was Xia Fu who took the Gekirangers under his wing, the others have taught his students the weapon techniques of their styles and the path to obtain Kageki. Once every year, the Kensei would gather to have their annual {{nihongo|Kensei Great Athletic Meet|\u62f3\u8056\u5927\u904b\u52d5\u4f1a|Kensei Daiund\u014dkai}}, where they hone their skills while maintaining fair sportsmanship.\n\nAfter the first Geki-Rin Rebellion, the Kensei created the {{nihongo|Sevenfold Barrier of Seven Sages|\u4e03\u91cd\u4e03\u8056\u306e\u95a2|Nanae Nanasei no Seki}} that prevents those of the Rin J\u016bken school to enter the sacred grounds of J\u016bgenky\u014d. However, the barrier can be torn down by the SoZyuTo which fell into Rio's hands. Unable to stop him, the Kensei faced the Kenma once more, during which the Kenma use their D\u014dkokugan Ringi to seal all seven Kensei into a boulder with Maku taking their power as his own. Later, when Maku and the other Kenma are destroyed, their Ringi faded and the Kensei returned to normal. Each of the Kensei, save Xia Fu, were named after a prominent figure in martial arts movies, with their group name a pun on ''[[sensei]]'' (master).\n\n=====Master Xia Fu=====\n{{nihongo|Master Xia Fu|\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30d5\u30fc|Masut\u0101 Sh\u0101 F\u016b}} is a grand master of the {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Felis]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30d5\u30a7\u30ea\u30b9\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Ferisuken}} style, having mastered all three of its aspects to channel Geki. He is the mentor of the Gekirangers and leader of the Kensei. He may have had a relationship with Rageku prior their transformations. Xia Fu turned down Brusa's offer to be his successor and suggested Maku, which wounded Maku's pride and ended their friendship. Xia Fu appears to be an aged [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[caracal]] with his eyes normally closed, opening them when he senses the Qi of the Akugata. He loves to be scratched on the neck, is referred to by Jyan as {{nihongo|\"Cat\"|\u732b|Neko}}, and always carries a [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] with him.

He is an anthropomorphic [[elephant]] and is somewhat perverted around women, earning him the nickname \"Erohung\" by Bae, yet is very fearful of ''[[sukeban]]''. Elehung was living on Shibe Mountain where, in the guise of a [[ghost|mononoke]], he took the package the Gekirangers were to deliver to him in order to test them. Elehung chose Ran as his student so she can master the Geki Hammer, though his teaching methods cause difficulty. Elehung also possessed a 20 billion yen gem called the Raspberry Diamond.

He appears as an anthropomorphic [[Greater Noctule bat|bat]] in [[Barong (mythology)|Barong]] attire. Stubborn and eccentric, he considers hanging upside down a great way to relieve stress. Though he initially refuses, Bat Li trains Retsu after witnessing his abilities first hand. He once saved a young girl named Hanyon, whom he promised to be with forever. However, he felt his presence put Hanyon in danger and left to master his Geki J\u016bken style; he reveals this to an elderly Hanyon so Ken can get the SoZyuTo back from her.

Sharkie Chan lives on the isolated Aozame Island, becoming its first sumo champ, until the Gekirangers arrive with Sharkie amazed by Jyan's skills in the \"canoe race\" test he set up. Jyan becomes Sharkie's first pupil, the two quickly forming a rapport. However Dokariya's interference and Geki Shark's sudden attack leaves Sharkie feeling unfit to train others, until his spirits are lifted when Jyan defends his honor and Xia Fu approves of him as a true mentor. Sharkie lost the Ikigimo in a tsunami and it came into the possession of a young celebrity named Alice.

Rin J\u016bken practitioners use a form of [[Qi]] called {{nihongo|Rinki|\u81e8\u6c17\uff08\u308a\u3093\u304d\uff09||\"Opposing Qi\"}}, which is powered by the darkness in one's heart and is used to perform fighting techniques called Ringi. The ultimate form of Rinki is the {{nihongo|Dorinki|\u6012\u81e8\u6c17\uff08\u3069\u308a\u3093\u304d\uff09||\"Anger Opposing Qi\"}}, which manifests through infinite rage and a desire to destroy everything.\n\n===Rin J\u016b Hall===\n[[Image:Rin Juuken Akugata.jpg|thumb|200px|Rio ([[Hirofumi Araki|Araki]]; center) and Mere ([[Yuka Hirata|Hirata]]; left) kneel before Rageku (right)]]\nThe {{nihongo|Rin J\u016b Hall|\u81e8\u7363\u6bbf|Rin J\u016b Den}} is a dojo and the primary location of the practitioners of Rin J\u016bken Akugata, on the remote Rin J\u016b Mountain. Previously under Maku's control, Rio took leadership and used many Rinsi and Rinrinsi as soldiers. It later became the base of the [[#Gen J\u016bken|Gen J\u016bken]] until Rio and Mere left it, burning the base to the ground to remove any trace of the Rin J\u016b Fist from existence.\n\n====Rio====\n{{nihongo|Rio|\u7406\u592e}} is the leader of the Rin J\u016bken style, the youngest to lead the Akugata, and a {{nihongo|Rinj\u016b [[Lion]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u62f3|Rin J\u016b Raionken}} expert. Rio is able to assume the fighting form called {{nihongo|Black Lion Rio|\u9ed2\u7345\u5b50\u30ea\u30aa|Kurojishi Rio}}, donning black and gold armor made of his own Rinki. His fighting style focuses on raw power. Rio's only interest is in gaining strength, so that he would not again have to suffer pain as he did when a [[#Long|monster]] murdered his family. While training under Xia Fu, Rio saw his senior Dan as a rival but was dissatisfied with his progress in the Beast Arts and turned to the Rin J\u016bken Akugata. Rio's closest friend Gou was unable to stop him; Rio mastered the Akugata and later battled Dan, only to learn that he was denied a true victory as Dan had been mortally wounded prior to their fight. Dan's dying words gives Rio a sense of a proper match to come from his [[Tiger versus lion|\"destined\" rival]]: Jyan.\n\nIn the Rinj\u016b Hall, Rio brought the Akugata's ancient warriors back from the dead, causing despair and sadness in humanity to gain power, and revived the Kenma Kata and Rageku. In the process, Rio learned to cultivate Rinki from his fear, hatred and jealousy. However, Rio is soon told by the two Kenma that the existence of Geki J\u016bken artists represent the limit of his power. Rio then, through a {{nihongo|Rin Command Ceremony|\u81e8\u547d\u5f0f|Rinmeishiki}}, swearing absolute loyalty to the Rin J\u016bken and the destruction of the Geki J\u016bken school, purged himself of all traces of the Beast Arts.\n\nRio easily defeats the Gekirangers but allows them to live and grow stronger that they might provide a proper challenge for him. Refusing to accept that the past still haunted him, Rio attempted to kill Retsu and Ran until Jyan defeats him as Super Geki Red. Wounded and enraged, Rio resurrects Maku to learn from him, but Maku overpowers Rio. Rio's self-hatred at this manifests into Dorinki, and he later disavows the Kenma and their wishes.\n\nAfter SaiDain's Beast Power Bloom, Rio realizes that he and the others exposed to it had become stronger than Maku. He tells Geki Red to defeat Maku and end to the war between their mentors so that their own war may commence. Upon Maku's defeat, Rio resumes his place as leader of the Rinj\u016b Hall. Long reveals himself and offers Rio greater power under Gen J\u016bken's guidance, and Rio later undergoes the Blood-Oath Ceremony, gaining a new fighting form, {{nihongo|Genj\u016b King Rio|\u5e7b\u7363\u738b\u30ea\u30aa|Genj\u016b\u014d Rio}}, that gives him mastery over the {{nihongo|Genj\u016b [[Griffin|Gryphon]]-Ken|\u5e7b\u7363\u30b0\u30ea\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u62f3|Gen J\u016b Gurifonken}} style. Rio spares Jyan again so he can grow stronger for their final confrontation, and when Rio is later defeated it allows him to awaken as the Destroyer, his mind corroded into a base desire to kill everything. He is restored by his feelings for Mere as she explains how Long used them. Long then abducts Mere, and Rio joins the Gekirangers to defeat Long and rescue Mere, renouncing his position as the Genj\u016b King in the process.\n\nAfter Long's defeat, Rio is invited to SCRTC along with Mere. However, Ran and Retsu are reluctant at this. Rio burns the Rinj\u016b Hall to symbolize the end of the Rin J\u016bken branch, and takes on Retsu in the Fist Judgment to cleanse himself, with the intention to sacrifice himself. However, Sanyo and a revived Long interrupt the proceedings as Long assumes his true form. After Mere's selfless sacrifice, Rio takes a small remnant of her Ki into himself and decides to eliminate Long, despite Jyan's protests. As a final act, he gives the Gekirangers the last remaining Rinki that was given to him by the Kenma as penance for his deeds, and sacrifices himself in order to stop Long's rampage, promising Jyan a rematch in the future. Upon arriving in the afterlife, he is met by Mere and the two walk off, hand in hand. During the finale, both Rio and Mere guide the three Gekirangers into the Rin J\u016b Hall and reveal the Kenma before them, showing the path to unifying the two J\u016bken schools. Rio is later revived during the events of ''Go-onger vs. Gekiranger'', helping to defeat Long Banki before returning to the afterlife as a condemned soul as the price of his revival.\n\nHis name is a play on ''leo'', the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for \"lion\".\n\nRio is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Hirofumi Araki]]|\u8352\u6728 \u5b8f\u6587|Araki Hirofumi}}. As a child, he is portrayed by {{nihongo|Shogo Ehara|\u6c5f\u539f \u7701\u543e|Ehara Sh\u014dgo}}.\n\n====Mere====\n{{nihongo|Mere|\u30e1\u30ec}} is a user of the {{nihongo|Rinj\u016b [[Chameleon]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30ab\u30e1\u30ec\u30aa\u30f3\u62f3|Rinj\u016b Kamereonken}} style, which focuses on stealth and accurate attacks. She died during the GekiRin Rebellion. Due to their similar objectives, Rio revived her as a Rinrinsi 10 years before the start of the series, infusing her with his Rinki so that she became human-like. Mere is completely dedicated to Rio and has an unrequited love for him. She is also cruel and malevolent, and finds satisfaction in intimidating the weak. She possesses a powerful Beast-Man form, armed with two [[Sai (weapon)|sai]]s and a tongue weapon.\n\nRio places Mere in charge during his absence to revive Kata. Mere eventually began to distrust Kata and his methods, deciding to revive the other Kenma to save Rio. However, she becomes Rageku's disciple after he recognizes her strength is superior to Rio's. While trying to help Rio, she is repeatedly tricked by Long, and breaks her personal taboo about dishonesty. She accompanies Rio to J\u016bgenky\u014d, where her potential is unlocked due to SaiDain's Beast Power Bloom, despite being undead. She joins Rio in learning how to harness the power Gen J\u016bken offers, undergoing the Blood-Oath Ceremony which resulted in her being reborn as a Genshou with mastery over the {{nihongo|Genj\u016b [[Fenghuang|Phoenix]]-Ken|\u5e7b\u7363\u30d5\u30a7\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u62f3|Genj\u016b Fenikkusuken}} style, which focuses on fire-based attacks.\n\nEventually, growing suspicious of Long's motives conflicting with Rio's, Mere investigates him to uncover his true agenda, and saves Rio from Long's scheme. Despite these efforts, Long manages to take Mere hostage and tortures her. She is rescued by the Gekirangers and Rio, who reciprocates her feelings. Seeing Rio purging the Genki from his body, she renounces her position as a Genshou and repays her debt to the Gekirangers by fighting Long. After Long's defeat, Mere and Rio were invited to live at SCRTC.\n\nMere and Rio decide to undergo the Fist Judgment to cleanse themselves of their sins. She faces Ran in the Fist Judgment, intending to end her life. Long's interference changed the scenario and she sacrifices her life to save the Gekirangers. During the finale, Mere, alongside Rio, guides the three Gekirangers inside an astral Rinj\u016b Hall, revealing the Kenma before them and showing the path to unifying the two J\u016bken schools.\n\nMere is later revived during the events of ''Go-onger vs. Gekiranger'', risking her immortal soul to fight by Rio's side once more. During the events of ''[[Uchu Sentai Kyuranger vs. Space Squad]]'', Mere is revived by Demost using one of the Neo Kyutama that Hammie stole for him. While the space ninja altered her memories to make her obedient, Mere regained her memories of Rio as she befriended Hammie and sacrificed herself to protect Hammie from Demost after joining her and the Kyurangers. Mere tells Hammie to continue living, with only her Neo Kyutama remaining.\n\nWhile a Genshou, her motif is the [[Vermilion Bird]] and the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]] of the [[Earthly Branches]]. Her name is taken from the English word {{nihongo|chameleon|\u30ab\u30e1\u30ec\u30aa\u30f3|kamereon}}.\n\nMere is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Yuka Hirata]]|\u5e73\u7530 \u88d5\u9999|Hirata Yuka}}.\n\n====Bae====\n{{nihongo|Bae|\u30d0\u30a8}} is a practitioner of the {{nihongo|Gekij\u016b [[Fly]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u62f3|Gekij\u016b Furaiken}} style, which turns his vocalizations into Geki. He fought Mere during the time of the GekiRin Rebellion, but was swallowed by her after assuming an imperfect anthropomorphic fly form. When Rio brought Mere back to life, Bae was resurrected within her stomach, and is dependent on Mere to remain alive. When a battle between the Geki Beasts and a giant Beast-Man begins, he impulsively acts as a commentator for the battle, rooting for Geki Tohja and Geki Fire, until it ends and Mere eats him once again. He aggravates Mere by acting as her unwanted confidant, and is knowledgeable about the Beast Arts. He is accused of being a traitor by some of the Kensai although he gives his life to help Gou; Mere subsequently revives Bae because he was originally revived by Rio. Mere has a change of heart when Bae brings the Gekirangers to save her, and thereafter treats him as an equal. When Mere purged herself of Genki, what remained of it entered Bae, giving him a true life. After the final battle, Bae tags along with Gou as he sets upon his own journey. He ends up in [[India]] until he returns in the climax of ''Go-Onger Vs. Gekiranger'' to commentate on the giant battle against Long Banki. Xia Fu said that his motto is {{nihongo|\"There is training while speaking\"|\u558b\u308a\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u4fee\u884c\u3042\u308a|Shaberi no naka ni shugy\u014d ari}}. His name is a play on the Japanese word for {{nihongo|\"fly\"|\u30cf\u30a8|hae}}.\n\nBae is voiced by {{nihongo|[[Akira Ishida]]|\u77f3\u7530 \u5f70|Ishida Akira}}.\n\n====Rinsis====\nThe {{nihongo|Rinsis|\u30ea\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30ba|Rinsh\u012bzu|1\u201336, 47 & 49}} are the ''[[jiangshi]]'' (reanimated corpse) warriors revived when Rio performed the Ringi technique \"Rinzai\". The Rinsi are low-level users in the Akugata led by Mere. They use lances as weapons and wear masks formed by a hat and a blindfold. The mask is removed if a Rinsi is promoted through the {{nihongo|Chamber of Trials|\u8a66\u3057\u306e\u623f|Tameshi no B\u014d}}, and an animal motif materializes on the forehead; the Rinsi then receives new attire and enters the rank of Rinrinsi who can briefly assume \"Beast-Man\" form. When they die, their bodies petrify and explode in blue flames. Maku sends their entire army against the Gekirangers, from which only one Rinsi survived. This {{nihongo|Dropout Rinsi|\u304a\u3061\u3053\u307c\u308c\u30ea\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc|Ochikobore Rinsh\u012b}} finds the Raspberry Diamond for Mere, dons Butoka armor, but is destroyed by Ken before Mere can enable his full power. The Rinsi are later revived by Long as his personal army, using them to fight the Gekirangers. The Dropout Rinshi is voiced by {{nihongo|Katsumi Shiono|\u5869\u91ce \u52dd\u7f8e|Shiono Katsumi}}.\n\n===The Three Kenma===\nThe {{nihongo|Three Kenma|\u4e09\u62f3\u9b54|San Kenma|\"Kenma\" literally translates as \"Fist Demon\"}} are the opposing force to the Kensei, based at the {{nihongo|Rinj\u016b Mountain|\u81e8\u7363\u5c71|Rin J\u016b Zan}} on which the Rinj\u016b Hall was built. They mastered the Beast-Man Wicked Body Change, with a high need for mass amounts of Rinki. The three who composed this group were, like the Kensei, students of Brusa Ee. But their pursuit of fear and rage as the ideal sources of power, combined with Maku's grudge against their mentor, led them to murder Brusa Ee and found the Akugata. Losing the Geki-Rin Rebellion, the Kenma were killed by the Kensei using SouZyuTo after sacrificing their humanity in the process. Once their bodies were sealed away, their souls were each sealed within a ring of the {{nihongo|Kenma Bracelet|\u62f3\u9b54\u306e\u8155\u8f2a|Kenma no Udewa}} created by the Kensei, which serves as a medium for the three to communicate with others at certain times.\n\nEvery 5,000 years, the Bracelet's power could be sealed at the sacred grounds of J\u016bgenky\u014d. Miki attempts this but Maki's interference allows the item to fall into Rio's possession. After obtaining the three final True Poison fangs from Braco, Rio resurrects Kata to train from him. Fearing Kata was a bad influence, Mere revived Rageku to replace him. Both Kata and Rageku see Rio and Mere as the ones to carry their legacy but Maku, whose resurrection was much harder to perform, takes over and declared a second Geki-Rin Rebellion with Rageku and Kata following him out of fear. All three are killed by Long's plan. However, when Jyan possesses the Kenma Bracelet, the three Kenma appear in their original human forms and aid the Gekirangers in mastering their fighting styles to defeat Long.\n\n====Kata====\n{{nihongo|Sky Kenma Kata|\u7a7a\u306e\u62f3\u9b54\u30ab\u30bf|Sora no Kenma Kata|1, 10\u201334 & 49}} is a grand master of the {{nihongo|Rin J\u016b [[Hawk]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30db\u30fc\u30af\u62f3|Rin J\u016b H\u014dkuken}}, whose fighting style focuses on aerial martial arts and genjustsu attacks on the opponent's psyche with a [[Ji (halberd)|halberd]] named the {{nihongo|Gale Sword|\u75be\u98a8\u306e\u5263|Shipp\u016b no Tsurugi}}. His power comes from hatred and malice. Rio revived Kata from a large stone tomb which Xia Fu sealed with a Geki barrier, located on a mountain summit beset with wind and lightning. Kata was impressed with this and Rio's ideals of power as absolute, and trains Rio to acquire Rinki from his malice and hatred, and to become the {{nihongo|\"lion cub\"|\u82e5\u7345\u5b50|Wakajishi}} to lead the Rin J\u016b Hall.\n\nKata's motto is {{nihongo|\"There is training in a battle to the death\"|\u6b7b\u95d8\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u4fee\u884c\u3042\u308a|Shit\u014d no naka ni shugy\u014d ari}}. His brutal training methods cause Mere to fear for Rio's well being. When Rageku is resurrected, Kata agrees for her to take over Rio's training and waits at Rinj\u016b Mountain. He and Rageku intend to celebrate Rio's victory over the Gekirangers by destroying the city, but sense Rio's defeat by Super Geki Red. When Rio revives Maku against Kata's warnings, Maku beats Katu and Rageku. During the burning of J\u016bgenky\u014d, Kata provokes the Gekirangers and Geki Violet into a fight, withstanding their strongest attacks, though Jyan overcomes his illusions; Kata then becomes enraged and enlarges to easily overcome Geki Fire and Geki Tohja Wolf, though he subsequently falls to SaiDaiOh's blade. In the finale, Kata's Rinki is transferred to Ran by Rio, who utilizes it to merge her own style with his, unifying both J\u016bken styles. While named after a {{Nihongo|[[hawk]]|\u9df9|taka}}, Kata's name plays on the Japanese word for {{Nihongo|\"[[kata#Japanese martial arts|martial arts style]]\"|\u578b|Kata}}\n\nBefore entering battle, Kata says, {{nihongo|\"Hatred is power givingly born.

Her training is based on jealousy and envy, targeting Master Xia Fu, whom she refers to as {{nihongo|\"Darling\"|\u30c0\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3|D\u0101rin}} as he spurned her romantic interests in the past. She addresses people of lower status using the informal {{nihongo|\"&#8209;chan\"|\u3061\u3083\u3093}} suffix, as opposed to {{nihongo|\"&#8209;san\"|\u3055\u3093}}. Rageku is the second of the Kenma to be revived, with Mere's help, buried at the bottom of the sea. She instructs both Rio and Mere, teaching them to gain power from their envy. She and Kata intended to celebrate their student's victory over the Gekirangers by destroying the city, until they sensed Rio's defeat by Super Geki Red. When Rio then revives Maku, against Rageku's advice, Maku beats Rageku and Kata.\n\nDuring the J\u016bgenky\u014d incident, Rageku uses her power to send the Gekirangers, Rio, and Mere back into the Edo era before incinerating the area in an attempt to destroy SaiDain. She later battled Geki Chopper and was nearly killed by him when he overcame her defenses. She is murdered by Long. Her Rinki is later transferred to Retsu by Rio, who utilizes it to merge her style with his own, unifying the two schools.\n\nBefore entering battle, Rageku says, {{nihongo|\"Envy is power bestowed.

He attacks with a set of bear-like claws that extend from his wrists. Maku draws power from his own burning rage to give himself tremendous Dorinki, allowing him to reign over the Rin J\u016b Hall and transfer power into selected servants. He is acknowledged by the Kensei as the most powerful J\u016bken user. Maku was infuriated that he was made Brusa Ee's successor on the recommendation of Xia Fu, Brusa's first choice, rather than on his own merits, and ended his friendship with Xia Fu. After meeting Long, he founded the Akugata, murdered Brusa Ee, and started the Geki-Rin Rebellion with plans to become the Destroyer, the strongest being on Earth.\n\nMaku was defeated in the rebellion and his body was placed behind a sealed door in Rinj\u016b Hall. Rio brakes the seal and Mere obtains the {{nihongo|Ikigimo|\u30a4\u30ad\u30ae\u30e2\uff08\u751f\u809d\uff09|Ikigimo|literally \"Life Organ\"}} to replace Maku's missing heart, allowing Rio to resurrect him. Maku expresses disgust with the changes that occurred while he was dead and overthrows Rio, resuming his role as leader and declaring a new Geki-Rin Rebellion. Maku refuses to teach Rio and goes to J\u016bgenky\u014d to kill him for insubordination. Maku becomes enraged by Rio's disrespect and the Kensei's criticisms, growing to giant form. He defeats Geki Fire and, with the Kenma, seals all seven Kensei into a boulder, from which Maku siphons their power. Maku faces the Gekirangers again to demonstrate his superiority, but SaiDain's Beast Power Bloom had empowered Rio who matches him. SaiDaiGeki Fire then defeats Maku. His Rinki is transferred to Jyan, who uses it to merge both Geki J\u016bken and Rin J\u016bken styles and unify the two schools.\n\nMaku is voiced by {{nihongo|[[Hidekatsu Shibata]]|\u67f4\u7530 \u79c0\u52dd|Shibata Hidekatsu}}.\n\n===Beast-Men===\nPerforming the Ringi Beast-Man Wicked Body Change allows a fighter of the Akugata to turn into a {{nihongo|Beast-Man|\u7363\u4eba|J\u016bjin}}, a fighting form that resembles their Rin J\u016bken style animal and makes full use of the style's Ringi.

Makirika is sent to retrieve the Kenma Bracelet from Miki, and later attacked the city but was defeated by Master Xia Fu. With the aid of Mere's Infinite-Violent Wave Ringi, he tore down a dam to flood the city. He is destroyed by Geki Tohja's Great Firm-Firm Fist.

With his powerful thighs and Rinki-charged horns, Gyuuya can break through solid walls. He initially overpowered Jyan but was forced to retreat due to inexperience.

They were summoned by Rio to destroy the Gekirangers, and defeated them in an initial match though they were later defeated in a poison match.

antagonists. Utilizing a golden [[Qi]] known as {{nihongo|Genki|\u5e7b\u6c17\uff08\u3052\u3093\u304d\uff09||\"Mythical Qi\"}}, the Gen J\u016bken seek to exceed the power of natural beasts by mastering the power of mythical beasts. They have thirteen fighting styles based on the [[Chinese zodiac]] and the [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Sacred Beasts]], represented by the {{nihongo|Four Genshou|\u56db\u5e7b\u5c06|Shi Gensh\u014d}}. The Gen J\u016bken style is gradually revealed as a front for Long to raise Rio though the {{nihongo|Infinite Path|\u7121\u9650\u9053|Mugend\u014d}}, turning him into a mindless monster who would destroy the world. All Gen J\u016bken users have a gold-colored fighting form.\n\n===Long===\nThe {{nihongo|Infinite Dragon Long|\u7121\u9593\u9f8d\u30ed\u30f3|Mugen Ry\u016b Ron|23\u201349}} is the coordinator of Genj\u016bken, its leader and the series antagonist. Although he calls himself a master of the {{nihongo|Gen J\u016b [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]]-Ken|\u5e7b\u7363\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u62f3|Gen J\u016b Doragonken}}, Long is not a human but an immortal known as the \"Infinite Dragon\", a many-headed golden dragon with terrible power who manipulates humanity on a whim. Because of his immortality and evil nature, Long found the world dull and decided to make it interesting by creating a Destroyer. This led to Long manipulating Maku, whom he trained to be the Destroyer while secretly aiding in the foundation of the Rin J\u016bken Akugata. But after the Kensei sealed Maku and the Kenma, Long was forced to wait until another pawn surfaced to replace Maku. Years later, Long found an ideal pawn in Rio, murdering the young boy's family and leaving him with a need to become strong to escape the memory of that moment. Long mortally wounded Dan years later before decimating the village where Jyan was born to insure no interference from Dan's family. Long then set up the Gen J\u016bken school, using the {{nihongo|Blood-Oath Ceremony|\u8840\u76df\u306e\u5100\u5f0f|Ketsumei no Gishiki}} to convert some into his servants.\n\nFor most of the series, Long hid behind the scenes while overseeing Rio's training. Long would appear before Mere to guide her assistance or cause trouble for the Gekirangers while keeping his distance. Long gradually becomes more involved blocking Rio from moving too soon, corrupting Mere, and manipulating the Kenma. Long offers to train Rio and converts Rio and Mere in the Blood-Oath Ceremony. Mere's interference revealed Long's treachery and true identity, and he takes her hostage to force Rio into resuming his role in his master plan. However, when Rio and Mere defy him by discarding their Genki, Long decides to kill them and find someone else to become the Destroyer.\n\nThough Long was apparently killed by SaiDai GekiRinTohja, he reconstituted himself within Sanyo's body. With a new interest in the J\u016bken power, Long assumes his true form to attack Jyan before killing Mere and then overpowering GekiTohja Wolf and SaiDaiOh. Rio attempted to kill Long, who assumed his fighting form to overwhelm the Gekirangers before rampaging through the city. Gou, Ken and the Kensei hold Long at bay until the primary Gekirangers return, having mastered Rin J\u016bken, and seal Long into a small golden orb. The D\u014dkokugan sphere is later guarded by Jyan, who believes that blessing the Ringi on to former J\u016bken users will insure the seal remains intact for generations.\n\nIn ''Engine Sentai Go-onger vs. Gekiranger'', Meka uses the Engine Souls as hostages to force Jyan into giving him the sealed Long, converting him to the {{nihongo|D\u014dkokugan Soul|\u615f\u54ed\u4e38\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb|D\u014dkokugan S\u014dru}} before installing it in Nunchaku Banki as part of his plan to rule the world with the dragon's power. But when Nunchaku Banki shut down, it is revealed the D\u014dkokugan's seal had been breached and Long partially emerged to enact his revenge on the Gekirangers. When revived Rio and Mere arrive, Long converts Nunchuck Banki into his vessel {{nihongo|Long Banki|\u30ed\u30f3\u30d0\u30f3\u30ad|Ron Banki}} before his host was destroyed by the Engine Beast Grand Prix while the D\u014dkokugan is restored to normal. He returned in ''[[Kamen Rider \u00d7 Super Sentai: Super Hero Taisen]]'', where he became a member of DaiZangyack. Long's name is based on ''l\u00f3ng'' ({{lang|zh|\u9f99}}), [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] for \"dragon\". His motifs are the [[Azure Dragon]] and the [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]] of the [[Earthly Branches]], although his fighting form is gold-colored.\n\nLong is played by {{nihongo|[[Naoki Kawano]]|\u5ddd\u91ce \u76f4\u8f1d|Kawano Naoki}}.\n\n===Sanyo===\n{{nihongo|Sanyo|\u30b5\u30f3\u30e8|San'yo|36\u201348}} is a master of the {{nihongo|Gen J\u016b [[Basilisk]]-Ken|\u5e7b\u7363\u30d0\u30b8\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u62f3|Gen J\u016b Bajirisukuken}}, using gravity-based attacks. He ends all his sentences with \"ayo\" and is constantly muttering. Long's right-hand man, Sanyo was created from Long's body. After Long entered Rio's service Sanyo drags in the large wooden coffin holding Suugu, unsuccessfully sending his apprentices to convince Rio of their power. His habit of blabbering hints of Long's true plans for Rio cause Mere to force him to reveal what he knows. He battles the Gekirangers to keep them from Mere and is defeated by her and Geki Blue, Yellow, Violet and Chopper. Surviving the battle because of his immortality, Sanyo serves his purpose to recreate Long but is reabsorbed by Long when he assumed his true form and full power. His name is based on Su\u0101n Y\u016d ({{lang|zh|\u9178\u8207}}) of the [[Shan Hai Jing]], and his motifs are the [[Black Tortoise]] and the [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]] of the [[Earthly Branches]].

Suugu was made by Long from Dan's Geki soul, without his mind. Suugu was awakened by Long in the presence of Rio, who recognizes him as Dan; this led to Rio embracing the Gen J\u016bken. Although he is mindless, part of Dan seems to remain in Suugu, who plays a leaf [[ocarina]]. Long tricks Rio into ordering Suugu to kill Jyan. During this battle, Suguu's memories as Dan reawakened, allowing him to overcome the Blood Oath's effect and take the blow Long intended for Jyan. Mortally wounded, Suugu has Jyan deal the deathblow to release Dan's soul from his physical prison. His name is based on S\u014du Y\u00fa ({{lang|zh|\u9a36\u865e}}) of the [[Shi Jing]], and his motifs are the [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]] and the [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]] of the [[Earthly Branches]]. Suugu is voiced by veteran Tokusatsu actor {{nihongo|[[Kenji Ohba]]|\u5927\u8449 \u5065\u4e8c|\u014cba Kenji}} who also portrayed Dan.\n\n==={{anchor|The Twin Gensi}}Twin Gensi===\nThe {{nihongo|Twin Gensi|\u53cc\u5e7b\u58eb|S\u014dgenshi}} are apprentices who support the Four Genshou:\n\n====Sanyo's Gensi====\n* {{nihongo|Gouyu|\u30b4\u30a6\u30e6|G\u014dyu|37\u201345}}: Master of the {{nihongo|Gen J\u016b [[Catoblepas]]-Ken|\u5e7b\u7363\u30b1\u30a4\u30c8\u30b9\u62f3|Gen J\u016b Keitosuken}} which uses sound-based attacks, chatting while fighting. He is the Gekirangers' first Gen J\u016bken opponent. He nearly defeats SaiDaiOh, GekiTohja Wolf and Geki Fire until GekiElephantFire damages him, although he survives the fight with the aid of Sanyo (who defeats all three opponents). He appears again to protect Rio from Gou, only to be destroyed in seconds by Gou's Heaven and Earth Disaster Strike. His name is based on H\u00e9 Y\u016d (\u5408\u7ab3) of the [[Shan Hai Jing]], and his motif is the [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]] of the [[Earthly Branches]].

He uses his {{nihongo|Mythical Reflection Mirror|\u5e7b\u5c04\u93e1|Genshaky\u014d}} armor to perform his mirror-Gengi, using it on Retsu to infiltrate the Gekirangers. Shiyuu is wounded by GekiBatTohja Wolf before SaiDaiOh lands the death blow. Shiyuu uses mirrors for his attacks but hates to be imitated, leading him to use strange words so it is difficult to emulate him. His name is based on [[Chi You|Ch\u012b Y\u00f3u]] ({{lang|zh|\u86a9\u5c24}}), and his motif is the [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]] of the [[Earthly Branches]].

Although she is Mere's apprentice, her loyalty lies with Long as she tries to keep the others away from him and Rio. She is destroyed by the Geki Beast group. Her name is based on F\u0113i Sh\u016d ({{lang|zh|\u98db\u9f20}}) of the [[Shan Hai Jing]], and her motif is the [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]] of the [[Earthly Branches]].

He was the sole survivor of Long's attack on his village, blocking his memories of the incident and becoming a [[feral child]] raised by tigers in the forest outside the {{nihongo|Beast Origin Village|\u7363\u6e90\u90f7|J\u016bgenky\u014d}}. Long had intended to kill Jyan due to his lineage, as the son of Dan, which enhances his sense of qi. Master Xia Fu began training Jyan as he personifies the {{nihongo|\"Body\"|\u4f53|Tai|also pronounced as ''Karada''}} of a Gekiranger: resistance to most forms of pain. His vocabulary is limited and he uses Jyan-ish phrases such as \"niki-niki\", \"zowa-zowa\", and \"waki-waki\", and has to learn about the \"Heart\". Jyan is eventually labeled as Rio's rival after witnessing the display of power used to stop his own attack. He becomes Sharkie Chan's first student of the {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Shark]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30af\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Sh\u0101kuken}} sword-fighting style. Though Jyan possesses the {{nihongo|Kageki|\u904e\u6fc0\u6c17|Kageki}}, he is unable to fully use it in his first fight with Rio.\n\nJyan is criticized for practising Geki J\u016bken to become stronger, a flawed ideology like Rio's, but he later realizes that his true reason to fight is to protect others. With this revelation he is able to transform into {{nihongo|Super Geki Red|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b2\u30ad\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|S\u016bp\u0101 Geki Reddo}}, using the {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Gorilla]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30b4\u30ea\u30e9\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Goriraken}} style and is the {{nihongo|\"Extremely Unbreakable Body\"|\u300c\u904e\u6fc0\u306b\u30a2\u30f3\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30ab\u30d6\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u300d|Kageki ni Anbureikaburu Bodi}}.\n\nJyan stops fighting after learning of his past with Rio and Dan, but with Xia Fu's help resumes his role as a Gekiranger, making an enemy out of Long. When Jyan regains his memories, he vows to make Long pay for his wrongdoings and beats sense into Rio. Rio then joins Jyan to save Mere and work together against their mutual enemy. After Long's defeat, Jyan invites both Rio and Mere to SCRTC, but is unable to convince Rio and Mere to not undertake the Fist Judgment to cleanse themselves of their sins. In memory of Rio, Jyan wears the Kenmas' Bracelet and vows to destroy Long.\n\nDuring the final battle, after being infused with Maku's Rinki, the Gekirangers are taken to an astral Rin J\u016b Hall, where they are met by Rio and Mere. Jyan masters the {{nihongo|Rin J\u016b [[Bear]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30d9\u30a2\u30fc\u62f3|Rinj\u016b Be\u0101ken}} style, unifying both Geki J\u016b and Rin J\u016b styles. With their newfound skills, the Gekirangers defeat Long, sealing him in a small ball, which Jyan keeps to ensure Long's power never falls into the wrong hands. He then leaves SCRTC to travel the world to find the next generation of Juken fighters. While teaching the Beast Fist to children in Hong Kong, he runs into a boy who looks similar to Rio and decides to take him under his wing. Returning to Japan, Jyan is ambushed by Nuchaku Banki before he, Ran, and Retsu are trapped in the subspace before the Go-ongers come to their aid. After his new friends lost their engines, and being tricked into giving away the sealed Long, Jyan helps S\u014dsuke train and develop his own Firece Ki before Long is able to fully manifest. With the aid of a revived Rio, Long is defeated and Jyan reaffirms his vow with Rio to become stronger.\n\nJyan is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Hiroki Suzuki (born 1983)|Hiroki Suzuki]]|\u9234\u6728 \u88d5\u6a39|Suzuki Hiroki}}. As a child, he is portrayed by {{nihongo|Arashi Fukasawa|\u6df1\u6fa4 \u5d50|Fukasawa Arashi}}.\n\n====Ran Uzaki====\n{{nihongo|Ran Uzaki/Geki Yellow|\u5b87\u5d0e \u30e9\u30f3\uff0f\u30b2\u30ad\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc|Uzaki Ran/Geki Ier\u014d}} is an employee of SCRTC and a {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Cheetah]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30c1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Ch\u012bt\u0101ken}} artist, using a combination of [[Wing Chun]] speed and accuracy in her attacks. Ran comes from a high-class family that owns a gym, and to ensure her future her mother Reiko wished her to leave SCRTC when she came of age for marriage. Ran is initially reluctant because she does not think she is good enough to learn the Beast Arts. She relies more on will than technique when fighting, and always tries to do things the right way, being a fighter that gives {{nihongo|\"Heart\"|\u5fc3|Shin|also pronounced as ''Kokoro''}} the highest place. She excels in speed, but her reluctance to care for the small details make her \"Technique\" very poor. From learning Master Elehung Kam-Bo's {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Elephant]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30a8\u30ec\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Erefantoken}} [[meteor hammer]] techniques, Ran became more relaxed and happy in the process.\n\nRan competes with Michelle Peng in a skateboarding competition to improve her \"Technique\" to obtain Kageki. This training allows her to become {{nihongo|Super Geki Yellow|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b2\u30ad\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc|S\u016bp\u0101 Geki Ier\u014d}}. As Super Geki Yellow she uses the {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Penguin]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30da\u30f3\u30ae\u30f3\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Penginken}} style and is the {{nihongo|\"Extremely Honest Heart\"|\u300c\u904e\u6fc0\u306b\u30aa\u30cd\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8\u300d|Kageki ni Onesuto H\u0101to}}. Soon after, Ran is appointed as team captain of the Gekirangers by Xia Fu.\n\nDuring the final battle, Ran is infused with Kata's Rinki, and is brought to an astral Rin J\u016b Hall to master the {{nihongo|Rin J\u016b [[Hawk]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30db\u30fc\u30af\u62f3|Rinj\u016b H\u014dkuken}} style to seal Long. Three months after Long's defeat, she is seen alongside Retsu teaching Juken to young children at SCRTC.\n\nRan is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Mina Fukui]]|\u798f\u4e95 \u672a\u83dc|Fukui Mina}}.\n\n====Retsu Fukami====\n{{nihongo|Retsu Fukami/Geki Blue|\u6df1\u898b \u30ec\u30c4\uff0f\u30b2\u30ad\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc|Fukami Retsu/Geki Bur\u016b}} is an employee of SCRTC and a {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Jaguar]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30b8\u30e3\u30ac\u30fc\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Jag\u0101ken}} practitioner, using [[Piguaquan]] martial-arts techniques. When he was a child his older brother Gou was killed, leaving him with a hatred for Rio who was said to be responsible. He set aside an artistic career to study the same fighting style as Gou, in order to move past his desire for revenge. Retsu is initially intelligent but selfish, does not take interest in others, and gives an impression of extreme coldness. He believes that winning should be like a painting, complete and inspirational. He sometimes mixes English loanwords in his speech. He learns of moving sensation of a trance{{clarify|date=November 2018}} when he masters Bat Li's {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Bat]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30d0\u30c3\u30c8\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Battoken}} style. He prioritizes {{nihongo|\"Techniques\"|\u6280|Gi|also pronounced as ''Waza''}} in his training. His attention to beauty costs him stamina, making his \"Body\" his weakest point until he beats Bion Biao in an endurance match to obtain Kageki, and becomes {{nihongo|Super Geki Blue|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b2\u30ad\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc|S\u016bp\u0101 Geki Bur\u016b}}. As Super Geki Blue, he uses the {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Gazelle]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30ac\u30bc\u30eb\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Gazeruken}} style and the {{nihongo|\"Extremely Fantastic Technique\"|\u300c\u904e\u6fc0\u306b\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u300d|Kageki ni Fantasutikku Tekunikku}}.\n\nDuring the final battle, Retsu is infused with Rageku's Rinki, and is brought to an astral Rin J\u016b Hall to master the {{nihongo|Rin J\u016b [[Jellyfish|Jelly]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30b8\u30a7\u30ea\u30fc\u62f3|Rinj\u016b Jer\u012bken}} style to seal Long. Three months after Long's defeat, he is seen alongside Ran teaching the Beast Fist to young children at SCRTC.\n\nRetsu is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Manpei Takagi]]|\u9ad8\u6728 \u4e07\u5e73|Takagi Manpei}}. As a child and a baby, he is portrayed by {{nihongo|Nao Fujisaki|\u85e4\u5d0e \u76f4|Fujisaki Nao}} and {{nihongo|Sora Kitajima|\u5317\u5cf6 \u7a7a|Kitajima Sora}}.\n\n====Gou Fukami====\n{{nihongo|Gou Fukami/Geki Violet|\u6df1\u898b \u30b4\u30a6\uff0f\u30b2\u30ad\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8|Fukami G\u014d/Geki Baioretto|22\u201349}} is the fourth member and a {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Wolf]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Urufuken}} user, a student alongside Rio and Miki. He is Retsu's protective older brother. After their parents died they were taken in by a church. Gou forced Retsu to promise never to take on the Juken, then went to face Rio. Gou used an imperfect form of the forbidden Geki Waza in an attempt to defeat and seal Rio, but it failed and Gou wandered for fifteen years in a [[werewolf]] form that he could not control.\n\nOnce regaining his human form, Gou was shocked at how much had changed and that Retsu was practising Geki J\u016bken. Though he is of the Geki J\u016bken, Gou lacks a passion for justice and fights only for himself. This resulted in Gou developing and mastering a dangerous form of Geki, called {{nihongo|Shigeki|\u7d2b\u6fc0\u6c17\uff08\u3057\u3052\u304d\uff09||\"Violet Fierce Qi\"}}, and reinventing the Wolf-Ken as his personal {{nihongo|Fukami-Style|\u6df1\u898b\u6d41|Fukamiry\u016b}}, a form that uses [[Muay Thai]] fighting moves. Xia Fu believed that Gou actually does have a passion for justice, and commissioned the GongChanger for Gou to use.

Gou desires to defeat Rio and prove himself as his rival, holding some animosity towards Jyan in this regard, but accepts that he is not up to the task after mastering the strongest Geki Waza but still failing to defeat Rio. He is later glad when Rio joins the fight against Long.\n\nDuring the final battle, Gou is among the other Geki J\u016bken warriors, including the Kensei, keeping Long at bay until Jyan, Ran, and Retsu return. After the battle is over, Gou sets upon his own journey with Bae to atone for his actions as a werewolf.\n\nGou is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Riki Miura]]|\u4e09\u6d66 \u529b|Miura Riki}}.\n\n====Ken Hisatsu====\n{{nihongo|Ken Hisatsu/Geki Chopper|\u4e45\u6d25 \u30b1\u30f3\uff0f\u30b2\u30ad\u30c1\u30e7\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Hisatsu Ken/Geki Chopp\u0101|27-49}} is the fifth member of the Gekiranger team, colored white with orange accents in a suit that resembles a [[karate uniform]].

Ken was originally to aid Ran and Retsu, but travelled abroad since his Geki Changer was broken. He also sold the SoZyuTo that Xia Fu gave him for travelling money. He is a free spirit, and does not restrict himself by talent or ties to the Geki J\u016bken. Ken can utilize the {{nihongo|Geki Hard Diamond|\u6fc0\u6c17\u7814\u947d|Geki Kensan}}, a karate technique in which he condenses his Geki into a diamond blade on his hand with which can cut through anything. He eventually manifested Kageki on Christmas Eve out of his passion for the holidays. He frequently uses the word {{nihongo|\"Ossu\"|\u62bc\u5fcd}}, which is [[karate]] term meaning \"patience with myself and others\". He also uses \"kenzan\", an archaic Japanese word that means \"just arrived\" and is also a pun on his name, Ken. Using the SoZyuTo, he can summon and control SaiDain/SaiDaiOh. ''Hisatsu ken'' can also translate as \"hidden technique\", which Ken has. After the final battle is over, Ken returns to work at SCRTC Meisters.\n\nKen is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Sotaro]]|\u8061\u592a\u90ce|S\u014dtar\u014d|Sotaro Yasuda}}.\n\n===Allies===\n\n====Miki Masaki====\n{{nihongo|Miki Masaki|\u771f\u54b2 \u7f8e\u5e0c|Masaki Miki}} is head of SCRTC's special development department and responsible for designing most of the Gekiranger's weapons.

She dislikes Elehung, despite his attraction to her. Before training in Geki J\u016bken, Miki was an infamous ''[[sukeban]]'' (female gangleader) in her youth, former leader of the Kanto Sukeban Alliance. She also knows and meets [[Search Guard Successor Foundation#Other SGS Members|SGS' Morio Makino]] and [[The Go-ongers#Hant J\u014d|Hant J\u014d]] from the [[Bakuryu Sentai Abaranger|Dino House]] she usually eats at.\n\nMiki is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Kazue Itoh]]|\u4f0a\u85e4 \u304b\u305a\u3048|It\u014d Kazue}}.\n\n====The Seven Kensei====\nThe {{nihongo|Seven Kensei|\u4e03\u62f3\u8056|Shichi Kensei|\"Kensei\" literally translates as \"Fist Sage\"}} are the legendary creators of the Geki J\u016bken style, originally under the wing of Brusa Ee. When three fellow students split away to found the Rin J\u016bken as [[Rin J\u016bken Akugata#The Three Kenma|Three Kenma]], killing Brusa Ee, the two groups battled in the Geki-Rin Rebellion. This ended with the Kensei using a forbidden Geki Waza that sealed the Kenmas' bodies while forcing the seven Kensei into their animal forms. They swore a Juken Oath of [[nonviolence]] soon after, fighting only in defense. Among them are the creators of the three Geki J\u016bken weapon styles that utilize one's heart and the [[meteor hammer]], one's technique and the [[war fan]], and one's body with [[saber]]s. Three others make up the {{nihongo|Master Triangle|\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb|Masut\u0101 Toraianguru}}, three Kensei who had each fully mastered one of the three major aspects of the Geki J\u016bken Beast Arts: Heart, Technique, and Body. The seventh Kensei, Xia Fu, mastered all three aspects of the Beast Arts and thus is the strongest of the Kensei. While it was Xia Fu who took the Gekirangers under his wing, the others have taught his students the weapon techniques of their styles and the path to obtain Kageki. Once every year, the Kensei would gather to have their annual {{nihongo|Kensei Great Athletic Meet|\u62f3\u8056\u5927\u904b\u52d5\u4f1a|Kensei Daiund\u014dkai}}, where they hone their skills while maintaining fair sportsmanship.\n\nAfter the first Geki-Rin Rebellion, the Kensei created the {{nihongo|Sevenfold Barrier of Seven Sages|\u4e03\u91cd\u4e03\u8056\u306e\u95a2|Nanae Nanasei no Seki}} that prevents those of the Rin J\u016bken school to enter the sacred grounds of J\u016bgenky\u014d. However, the barrier can be torn down by the SoZyuTo which fell into Rio's hands. Unable to stop him, the Kensei faced the Kenma once more, during which the Kenma use their D\u014dkokugan Ringi to seal all seven Kensei into a boulder with Maku taking their power as his own. Later, when Maku and the other Kenma are destroyed, their Ringi faded and the Kensei returned to normal. Each of the Kensei, save Xia Fu, were named after a prominent figure in martial arts movies, with their group name a pun on ''[[sensei]]'' (master).\n\n=====Master Xia Fu=====\n{{nihongo|Master Xia Fu|\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30d5\u30fc|Masut\u0101 Sh\u0101 F\u016b}} is a grand master of the {{nihongo|Geki J\u016b [[Felis]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30d5\u30a7\u30ea\u30b9\u62f3|Geki J\u016b Ferisuken}} style, having mastered all three of its aspects to channel Geki. He is the mentor of the Gekirangers and leader of the Kensei. He may have had a relationship with Rageku prior their transformations. Xia Fu turned down Brusa's offer to be his successor and suggested Maku, which wounded Maku's pride and ended their friendship. Xia Fu appears to be an aged [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[caracal]] with his eyes normally closed, opening them when he senses the Qi of the Akugata. He loves to be scratched on the neck, is referred to by Jyan as {{nihongo|\"Cat\"|\u732b|Neko}}, and always carries a [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] with him.

He is an anthropomorphic [[elephant]] and is somewhat perverted around women, earning him the nickname \"Erohung\" by Bae, yet is very fearful of ''[[sukeban]]''. Elehung was living on Shibe Mountain where, in the guise of a [[ghost|mononoke]], he took the package the Gekirangers were to deliver to him in order to test them. Elehung chose Ran as his student so she can master the Geki Hammer, though his teaching methods cause difficulty. Elehung also possessed a 20 billion yen gem called the Raspberry Diamond.

He appears as an anthropomorphic [[Greater Noctule bat|bat]] in [[Barong (mythology)|Barong]] attire. Stubborn and eccentric, he considers hanging upside down a great way to relieve stress. Though he initially refuses, Bat Li trains Retsu after witnessing his abilities first hand. He once saved a young girl named Hanyon, whom he promised to be with forever. However, he felt his presence put Hanyon in danger and left to master his Geki J\u016bken style; he reveals this to an elderly Hanyon so Ken can get the SoZyuTo back from her.

However Dokariya's interference and Geki Shark's sudden attack leaves Sharkie feeling unfit to train others, until his spirits are lifted when Jyan defends his honor and Xia Fu approves of him as a true mentor.

He once battled Cosmic Kenp\u014d Master Pachacamac in a 200-day battle, winning Pachacamac's two jewels that reveal the secret moves of Cosmic Kenp\u014d. Later, Brusa taught ten students, who in time became the Kensei and the Kenma. Brusa hoped that Xia Fu would succeed him as Juken master, but Xia Fu refused and recommended Maku as heir. Maku was enraged at this and with the other Kenma divided the school in the Geki-Rin Rebellion, murdering Brusa.

Rin J\u016bken practitioners use a form of [[Qi]] called {{nihongo|Rinki|\u81e8\u6c17\uff08\u308a\u3093\u304d\uff09||\"Opposing Qi\"}}, which is powered by the darkness in one's heart and is used to perform fighting techniques called Ringi. The ultimate form of Rinki is the {{nihongo|Dorinki|\u6012\u81e8\u6c17\uff08\u3069\u308a\u3093\u304d\uff09||\"Anger Opposing Qi\"}}, which manifests through infinite rage and a desire to destroy everything.\n\n===Rin J\u016b Hall===\n[[Image:Rin Juuken Akugata.jpg|thumb|200px|Rio ([[Hirofumi Araki|Araki]]; center) and Mere ([[Yuka Hirata|Hirata]]; left) kneel before Rageku (right)]]\nThe {{nihongo|Rin J\u016b Hall|\u81e8\u7363\u6bbf|Rin J\u016b Den}} is a dojo and the primary location of the practitioners of Rin J\u016bken Akugata, on the remote Rin J\u016b Mountain. Previously under Maku's control, Rio took leadership and used many Rinsi and Rinrinsi as soldiers. It later became the base of the [[#Gen J\u016bken|Gen J\u016bken]] until Rio and Mere left it, burning the base to the ground to remove any trace of the Rin J\u016b Fist from existence.\n\n====Rio====\n{{nihongo|Rio|\u7406\u592e}} is the leader of the Rin J\u016bken style, the youngest to lead the Akugata, and a {{nihongo|Rinj\u016b [[Lion]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u62f3|Rin J\u016b Raionken}} expert. Rio is able to assume the fighting form called {{nihongo|Black Lion Rio|\u9ed2\u7345\u5b50\u30ea\u30aa|Kurojishi Rio}}, donning black and gold armor made of his own Rinki. His fighting style focuses on raw power. Rio's only interest is in gaining strength, so that he would not again have to suffer pain as he did when a [[#Long|monster]] murdered his family. While training under Xia Fu, Rio saw his senior Dan as a rival but was dissatisfied with his progress in the Beast Arts and turned to the Rin J\u016bken Akugata. Rio's closest friend Gou was unable to stop him; Rio mastered the Akugata and later battled Dan, only to learn that he was denied a true victory as Dan had been mortally wounded prior to their fight. Dan's dying words gives Rio a sense of a proper match to come from his [[Tiger versus lion|\"destined\" rival]]: Jyan.\n\nIn the Rinj\u016b Hall, Rio brought the Akugata's ancient warriors back from the dead, causing despair and sadness in humanity to gain power, and revived the Kenma Kata and Rageku. In the process, Rio learned to cultivate Rinki from his fear, hatred and jealousy. However, Rio is soon told by the two Kenma that the existence of Geki J\u016bken artists represent the limit of his power. Rio then, through a {{nihongo|Rin Command Ceremony|\u81e8\u547d\u5f0f|Rinmeishiki}}, swearing absolute loyalty to the Rin J\u016bken and the destruction of the Geki J\u016bken school, purged himself of all traces of the Beast Arts.\n\nRio easily defeats the Gekirangers but allows them to live and grow stronger that they might provide a proper challenge for him. Refusing to accept that the past still haunted him, Rio attempted to kill Retsu and Ran until Jyan defeats him as Super Geki Red. Wounded and enraged, Rio resurrects Maku to learn from him, but Maku overpowers Rio. Rio's self-hatred at this manifests into Dorinki, and he later disavows the Kenma and their wishes.\n\nAfter SaiDain's Beast Power Bloom, Rio realizes that he and the others exposed to it had become stronger than Maku. He tells Geki Red to defeat Maku and end to the war between their mentors so that their own war may commence. Upon Maku's defeat, Rio resumes his place as leader of the Rinj\u016b Hall. Long reveals himself and offers Rio greater power under Gen J\u016bken's guidance, and Rio later undergoes the Blood-Oath Ceremony, gaining a new fighting form, {{nihongo|Genj\u016b King Rio|\u5e7b\u7363\u738b\u30ea\u30aa|Genj\u016b\u014d Rio}}, that gives him mastery over the {{nihongo|Genj\u016b [[Griffin|Gryphon]]-Ken|\u5e7b\u7363\u30b0\u30ea\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u62f3|Gen J\u016b Gurifonken}} style. Rio spares Jyan again so he can grow stronger for their final confrontation, and when Rio is later defeated it allows him to awaken as the Destroyer, his mind corroded into a base desire to kill everything. He is restored by his feelings for Mere as she explains how Long used them. Long then abducts Mere, and Rio joins the Gekirangers to defeat Long and rescue Mere, renouncing his position as the Genj\u016b King in the process.\n\nAfter Long's defeat, Rio is invited to SCRTC along with Mere. However, Ran and Retsu are reluctant at this. Rio burns the Rinj\u016b Hall to symbolize the end of the Rin J\u016bken branch, and takes on Retsu in the Fist Judgment to cleanse himself, with the intention to sacrifice himself. However, Sanyo and a revived Long interrupt the proceedings as Long assumes his true form. After Mere's selfless sacrifice, Rio takes a small remnant of her Ki into himself and decides to eliminate Long, despite Jyan's protests. As a final act, he gives the Gekirangers the last remaining Rinki that was given to him by the Kenma as penance for his deeds, and sacrifices himself in order to stop Long's rampage, promising Jyan a rematch in the future. Upon arriving in the afterlife, he is met by Mere and the two walk off, hand in hand. During the finale, both Rio and Mere guide the three Gekirangers into the Rin J\u016b Hall and reveal the Kenma before them, showing the path to unifying the two J\u016bken schools. Rio is later revived during the events of ''Go-onger vs. Gekiranger'', helping to defeat Long Banki before returning to the afterlife as a condemned soul as the price of his revival.\n\nHis name is a play on ''leo'', the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for \"lion\".\n\nRio is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Hirofumi Araki]]|\u8352\u6728 \u5b8f\u6587|Araki Hirofumi}}. As a child, he is portrayed by {{nihongo|Shogo Ehara|\u6c5f\u539f \u7701\u543e|Ehara Sh\u014dgo}}.\n\n====Mere====\n{{nihongo|Mere|\u30e1\u30ec}} is a user of the {{nihongo|Rinj\u016b [[Chameleon]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30ab\u30e1\u30ec\u30aa\u30f3\u62f3|Rinj\u016b Kamereonken}} style, which focuses on stealth and accurate attacks. She died during the GekiRin Rebellion. Due to their similar objectives, Rio revived her as a Rinrinsi 10 years before the start of the series, infusing her with his Rinki so that she became human-like. Mere is completely dedicated to Rio and has an unrequited love for him. She is also cruel and malevolent, and finds satisfaction in intimidating the weak. She possesses a powerful Beast-Man form, armed with two [[Sai (weapon)|sai]]s and a tongue weapon.\n\nRio places Mere in charge during his absence to revive Kata. Mere eventually began to distrust Kata and his methods, deciding to revive the other Kenma to save Rio. However, she becomes Rageku's disciple after he recognizes her strength is superior to Rio's. While trying to help Rio, she is repeatedly tricked by Long, and breaks her personal taboo about dishonesty. She accompanies Rio to J\u016bgenky\u014d, where her potential is unlocked due to SaiDain's Beast Power Bloom, despite being undead. She joins Rio in learning how to harness the power Gen J\u016bken offers, undergoing the Blood-Oath Ceremony which resulted in her being reborn as a Genshou with mastery over the {{nihongo|Genj\u016b [[Fenghuang|Phoenix]]-Ken|\u5e7b\u7363\u30d5\u30a7\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u62f3|Genj\u016b Fenikkusuken}} style, which focuses on fire-based attacks.\n\nEventually, growing suspicious of Long's motives conflicting with Rio's, Mere investigates him to uncover his true agenda, and saves Rio from Long's scheme. Despite these efforts, Long manages to take Mere hostage and tortures her. She is rescued by the Gekirangers and Rio, who reciprocates her feelings. Seeing Rio purging the Genki from his body, she renounces her position as a Genshou and repays her debt to the Gekirangers by fighting Long. After Long's defeat, Mere and Rio were invited to live at SCRTC.\n\nMere and Rio decide to undergo the Fist Judgment to cleanse themselves of their sins. She faces Ran in the Fist Judgment, intending to end her life. Long's interference changed the scenario and she sacrifices her life to save the Gekirangers. During the finale, Mere, alongside Rio, guides the three Gekirangers inside an astral Rinj\u016b Hall, revealing the Kenma before them and showing the path to unifying the two J\u016bken schools.\n\nMere is later revived during the events of ''Go-onger vs. Gekiranger'', risking her immortal soul to fight by Rio's side once more. During the events of ''[[Uchu Sentai Kyuranger vs. Space Squad]]'', Mere is revived by Demost using one of the Neo Kyutama that Hammie stole for him. While the space ninja altered her memories to make her obedient, Mere regained her memories of Rio as she befriended Hammie and sacrificed herself to protect Hammie from Demost after joining her and the Kyurangers. Mere tells Hammie to continue living, with only her Neo Kyutama remaining.\n\nWhile a Genshou, her motif is the [[Vermilion Bird]] and the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]] of the [[Earthly Branches]]. Her name is taken from the English word {{nihongo|chameleon|\u30ab\u30e1\u30ec\u30aa\u30f3|kamereon}}.\n\nMere is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Yuka Hirata]]|\u5e73\u7530 \u88d5\u9999|Hirata Yuka}}.\n\n====Bae====\n{{nihongo|Bae|\u30d0\u30a8}} is a practitioner of the {{nihongo|Gekij\u016b [[Fly]]-Ken|\u6fc0\u7363\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u62f3|Gekij\u016b Furaiken}} style, which turns his vocalizations into Geki. He fought Mere during the time of the GekiRin Rebellion, but was swallowed by her after assuming an imperfect anthropomorphic fly form. When Rio brought Mere back to life, Bae was resurrected within her stomach, and is dependent on Mere to remain alive. When a battle between the Geki Beasts and a giant Beast-Man begins, he impulsively acts as a commentator for the battle, rooting for Geki Tohja and Geki Fire, until it ends and Mere eats him once again. He aggravates Mere by acting as her unwanted confidant, and is knowledgeable about the Beast Arts. He is accused of being a traitor by some of the Kensai although he gives his life to help Gou; Mere subsequently revives Bae because he was originally revived by Rio. Mere has a change of heart when Bae brings the Gekirangers to save her, and thereafter treats him as an equal. When Mere purged herself of Genki, what remained of it entered Bae, giving him a true life. After the final battle, Bae tags along with Gou as he sets upon his own journey. He ends up in [[India]] until he returns in the climax of ''Go-Onger Vs. Gekiranger'' to commentate on the giant battle against Long Banki. Xia Fu said that his motto is {{nihongo|\"There is training while speaking\"|\u558b\u308a\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u4fee\u884c\u3042\u308a|Shaberi no naka ni shugy\u014d ari}}. His name is a play on the Japanese word for {{nihongo|\"fly\"|\u30cf\u30a8|hae}}.\n\nBae is voiced by {{nihongo|[[Akira Ishida]]|\u77f3\u7530 \u5f70|Ishida Akira}}.\n\n====Rinsis====\nThe {{nihongo|Rinsis|\u30ea\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30ba|Rinsh\u012bzu|1\u201336, 47 & 49}} are the ''[[jiangshi]]'' (reanimated corpse) warriors revived when Rio performed the Ringi technique \"Rinzai\". The Rinsi are low-level users in the Akugata led by Mere. They use lances as weapons and wear masks formed by a hat and a blindfold. The mask is removed if a Rinsi is promoted through the {{nihongo|Chamber of Trials|\u8a66\u3057\u306e\u623f|Tameshi no B\u014d}}, and an animal motif materializes on the forehead; the Rinsi then receives new attire and enters the rank of Rinrinsi who can briefly assume \"Beast-Man\" form. When they die, their bodies petrify and explode in blue flames. Maku sends their entire army against the Gekirangers, from which only one Rinsi survived. This {{nihongo|Dropout Rinsi|\u304a\u3061\u3053\u307c\u308c\u30ea\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc|Ochikobore Rinsh\u012b}} finds the Raspberry Diamond for Mere, dons Butoka armor, but is destroyed by Ken before Mere can enable his full power. The Rinsi are later revived by Long as his personal army, using them to fight the Gekirangers. The Dropout Rinshi is voiced by {{nihongo|Katsumi Shiono|\u5869\u91ce \u52dd\u7f8e|Shiono Katsumi}}.\n\n===The Three Kenma===\nThe {{nihongo|Three Kenma|\u4e09\u62f3\u9b54|San Kenma|\"Kenma\" literally translates as \"Fist Demon\"}} are the opposing force to the Kensei, based at the {{nihongo|Rinj\u016b Mountain|\u81e8\u7363\u5c71|Rin J\u016b Zan}} on which the Rinj\u016b Hall was built. They mastered the Beast-Man Wicked Body Change, with a high need for mass amounts of Rinki. The three who composed this group were, like the Kensei, students of Brusa Ee. But their pursuit of fear and rage as the ideal sources of power, combined with Maku's grudge against their mentor, led them to murder Brusa Ee and found the Akugata. Losing the Geki-Rin Rebellion, the Kenma were killed by the Kensei using SouZyuTo after sacrificing their humanity in the process. Once their bodies were sealed away, their souls were each sealed within a ring of the {{nihongo|Kenma Bracelet|\u62f3\u9b54\u306e\u8155\u8f2a|Kenma no Udewa}} created by the Kensei, which serves as a medium for the three to communicate with others at certain times.\n\nEvery 5,000 years, the Bracelet's power could be sealed at the sacred grounds of J\u016bgenky\u014d. Miki attempts this but Maki's interference allows the item to fall into Rio's possession. After obtaining the three final True Poison fangs from Braco, Rio resurrects Kata to train from him. Fearing Kata was a bad influence, Mere revived Rageku to replace him. Both Kata and Rageku see Rio and Mere as the ones to carry their legacy but Maku, whose resurrection was much harder to perform, takes over and declared a second Geki-Rin Rebellion with Rageku and Kata following him out of fear. All three are killed by Long's plan. However, when Jyan possesses the Kenma Bracelet, the three Kenma appear in their original human forms and aid the Gekirangers in mastering their fighting styles to defeat Long.\n\n====Kata====\n{{nihongo|Sky Kenma Kata|\u7a7a\u306e\u62f3\u9b54\u30ab\u30bf|Sora no Kenma Kata|1, 10\u201334 & 49}} is a grand master of the {{nihongo|Rin J\u016b [[Hawk]]-Ken|\u81e8\u7363\u30db\u30fc\u30af\u62f3|Rin J\u016b H\u014dkuken}}, whose fighting style focuses on aerial martial arts and genjustsu attacks on the opponent's psyche with a [[Ji (halberd)|halberd]] named the {{nihongo|Gale Sword|\u75be\u98a8\u306e\u5263|Shipp\u016b no Tsurugi}}. His power comes from hatred and malice. Rio revived Kata from a large stone tomb which Xia Fu sealed with a Geki barrier, located on a mountain summit beset with wind and lightning. Kata was impressed with this and Rio's ideals of power as absolute, and trains Rio to acquire Rinki from his malice and hatred, and to become the {{nihongo|\"lion cub\"|\u82e5\u7345\u5b50|Wakajishi}} to lead the Rin J\u016b Hall.\n\nKata's motto is {{nihongo|\"There is training in a battle to the death\"|\u6b7b\u95d8\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u4fee\u884c\u3042\u308a|Shit\u014d no naka ni shugy\u014d ari}}. His brutal training methods cause Mere to fear for Rio's well being. When Rageku is resurrected, Kata agrees for her to take over Rio's training and waits at Rinj\u016b Mountain. He and Rageku intend to celebrate Rio's victory over the Gekirangers by destroying the city, but sense Rio's defeat by Super Geki Red. When Rio revives Maku against Kata's warnings, Maku beats Katu and Rageku. During the burning of J\u016bgenky\u014d, Kata provokes the Gekirangers and Geki Violet into a fight, withstanding their strongest attacks, though Jyan overcomes his illusions; Kata then becomes enraged and enlarges to easily overcome Geki Fire and Geki Tohja Wolf, though he subsequently falls to SaiDaiOh's blade. In the finale, Kata's Rinki is transferred to Ran by Rio, who utilizes it to merge her own style with his, unifying both J\u016bken styles. While named after a {{Nihongo|[[hawk]]|\u9df9|taka}}, Kata's name plays on the Japanese word for {{Nihongo|\"[[kata#Japanese martial arts|martial arts style]]\"|\u578b|Kata}}\n\nBefore entering battle, Kata says, {{nihongo|\"Hatred is power givingly born.

She addresses people of lower status using the informal {{nihongo|\"&#8209;chan\"|\u3061\u3083\u3093}} suffix, as opposed to {{nihongo|\"&#8209;san\"|\u3055\u3093}}. Rageku is the second of the Kenma to be revived, with Mere's help, buried at the bottom of the sea. She instructs both Rio and Mere, teaching them to gain power from their envy. She and Kata intended to celebrate their student's victory over the Gekirangers by destroying the city, until they sensed Rio's defeat by Super Geki Red. When Rio then revives Maku, against Rageku's advice, Maku beats Rageku and Kata.\n\nDuring the J\u016bgenky\u014d incident, Rageku uses her power to send the Gekirangers, Rio, and Mere back into the Edo era before incinerating the area in an attempt to destroy SaiDain. She later battled Geki Chopper and was nearly killed by him when he overcame her defenses. She is murdered by Long. Her Rinki is later transferred to Retsu by Rio, who utilizes it to merge her style with his own, unifying the two schools.\n\nBefore entering battle, Rageku says, {{nihongo|\"Envy is power bestowed.

He attacks with a set of bear-like claws that extend from his wrists. Maku draws power from his own burning rage to give himself tremendous Dorinki, allowing him to reign over the Rin J\u016b Hall and transfer power into selected servants. He is acknowledged by the Kensei as the most powerful J\u016bken user. Maku was infuriated that he was made Brusa Ee's successor on the recommendation of Xia Fu, Brusa's first choice, rather than on his own merits, and ended his friendship with Xia Fu. After meeting Long, he founded the Akugata, murdered Brusa Ee, and started the Geki-Rin Rebellion with plans to become the Destroyer, the strongest being on Earth.\n\nMaku was defeated in the rebellion and his body was placed behind a sealed door in Rinj\u016b Hall. Rio brakes the seal and Mere obtains the {{nihongo|Ikigimo|\u30a4\u30ad\u30ae\u30e2\uff08\u751f\u809d\uff09|Ikigimo|literally \"Life Organ\"}} to replace Maku's missing heart, allowing Rio to resurrect him. Maku expresses disgust with the changes that occurred while he was dead and overthrows Rio, resuming his role as leader and declaring a new Geki-Rin Rebellion. Maku refuses to teach Rio and goes to J\u016bgenky\u014d to kill him for insubordination. Maku becomes enraged by Rio's disrespect and the Kensei's criticisms, growing to giant form. He defeats Geki Fire and, with the Kenma, seals all seven Kensei into a boulder, from which Maku siphons their power. Maku faces the Gekirangers again to demonstrate his superiority, but SaiDain's Beast Power Bloom had empowered Rio who matches him. SaiDaiGeki Fire then defeats Maku. His Rinki is transferred to Jyan, who uses it to merge both Geki J\u016bken and Rin J\u016bken styles and unify the two schools.\n\nMaku is voiced by {{nihongo|[[Hidekatsu Shibata]]|\u67f4\u7530 \u79c0\u52dd|Shibata Hidekatsu}}.\n\n===Beast-Men===\nPerforming the Ringi Beast-Man Wicked Body Change allows a fighter of the Akugata to turn into a {{nihongo|Beast-Man|\u7363\u4eba|J\u016bjin}}, a fighting form that resembles their Rin J\u016bken style animal and makes full use of the style's Ringi.

Makirika is sent to retrieve the Kenma Bracelet from Miki, and later attacked the city but was defeated by Master Xia Fu.

antagonists. Utilizing a golden [[Qi]] known as {{nihongo|Genki|\u5e7b\u6c17\uff08\u3052\u3093\u304d\uff09||\"Mythical Qi\"}}, the Gen J\u016bken seek to exceed the power of natural beasts by mastering the power of mythical beasts. They have thirteen fighting styles based on the [[Chinese zodiac]] and the [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Sacred Beasts]], represented by the {{nihongo|Four Genshou|\u56db\u5e7b\u5c06|Shi Gensh\u014d}}. The Gen J\u016bken style is gradually revealed as a front for Long to raise Rio though the {{nihongo|Infinite Path|\u7121\u9650\u9053|Mugend\u014d}}, turning him into a mindless monster who would destroy the world. All Gen J\u016bken users have a gold-colored fighting form.\n\n===Long===\nThe {{nihongo|Infinite Dragon Long|\u7121\u9593\u9f8d\u30ed\u30f3|Mugen Ry\u016b Ron|23\u201349}} is the coordinator of Genj\u016bken, its leader and the series antagonist. Although he calls himself a master of the {{nihongo|Gen J\u016b [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]]-Ken|\u5e7b\u7363\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u62f3|Gen J\u016b Doragonken}}, Long is not a human but an immortal known as the \"Infinite Dragon\", a many-headed golden dragon with terrible power who manipulates humanity on a whim. Because of his immortality and evil nature, Long found the world dull and decided to make it interesting by creating a Destroyer. This led to Long manipulating Maku, whom he trained to be the Destroyer while secretly aiding in the foundation of the Rin J\u016bken Akugata. But after the Kensei sealed Maku and the Kenma, Long was forced to wait until another pawn surfaced to replace Maku. Years later, Long found an ideal pawn in Rio, murdering the young boy's family and leaving him with a need to become strong to escape the memory of that moment. Long mortally wounded Dan years later before decimating the village where Jyan was born to insure no interference from Dan's family. Long then set up the Gen J\u016bken school, using the {{nihongo|Blood-Oath Ceremony|\u8840\u76df\u306e\u5100\u5f0f|Ketsumei no Gishiki}} to convert some into his servants.\n\nFor most of the series, Long hid behind the scenes while overseeing Rio's training. Long would appear before Mere to guide her assistance or cause trouble for the Gekirangers while keeping his distance. Long gradually becomes more involved blocking Rio from moving too soon, corrupting Mere, and manipulating the Kenma. Long offers to train Rio and converts Rio and Mere in the Blood-Oath Ceremony. Mere's interference revealed Long's treachery and true identity, and he takes her hostage to force Rio into resuming his role in his master plan. However, when Rio and Mere defy him by discarding their Genki, Long decides to kill them and find someone else to become the Destroyer.\n\nThough Long was apparently killed by SaiDai GekiRinTohja, he reconstituted himself within Sanyo's body. With a new interest in the J\u016bken power, Long assumes his true form to attack Jyan before killing Mere and then overpowering GekiTohja Wolf and SaiDaiOh. Rio attempted to kill Long, who assumed his fighting form to overwhelm the Gekirangers before rampaging through the city. Gou, Ken and the Kensei hold Long at bay until the primary Gekirangers return, having mastered Rin J\u016bken, and seal Long into a small golden orb. The D\u014dkokugan sphere is later guarded by Jyan, who believes that blessing the Ringi on to former J\u016bken users will insure the seal remains intact for generations.\n\nIn ''Engine Sentai Go-onger vs. Gekiranger'', Meka uses the Engine Souls as hostages to force Jyan into giving him the sealed Long, converting him to the {{nihongo|D\u014dkokugan Soul|\u615f\u54ed\u4e38\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb|D\u014dkokugan S\u014dru}} before installing it in Nunchaku Banki as part of his plan to rule the world with the dragon's power. But when Nunchaku Banki shut down, it is revealed the D\u014dkokugan's seal had been breached and Long partially emerged to enact his revenge on the Gekirangers. When revived Rio and Mere arrive, Long converts Nunchuck Banki into his vessel {{nihongo|Long Banki|\u30ed\u30f3\u30d0\u30f3\u30ad|Ron Banki}} before his host was destroyed by the Engine Beast Grand Prix while the D\u014dkokugan is restored to normal. He returned in ''[[Kamen Rider \u00d7 Super Sentai: Super Hero Taisen]]'', where he became a member of DaiZangyack. Long's name is based on ''l\u00f3ng'' ({{lang|zh|\u9f99}}), [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] for \"dragon\". His motifs are the [[Azure Dragon]] and the [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]] of the [[Earthly Branches]], although his fighting form is gold-colored.\n\nLong is played by {{nihongo|[[Naoki Kawano]]|\u5ddd\u91ce \u76f4\u8f1d|Kawano Naoki}}.\n\n===Sanyo===\n{{nihongo|Sanyo|\u30b5\u30f3\u30e8|San'yo|36\u201348}} is a master of the {{nihongo|Gen J\u016b [[Basilisk]]-Ken|\u5e7b\u7363\u30d0\u30b8\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u62f3|Gen J\u016b Bajirisukuken}}, using gravity-based attacks. He ends all his sentences with \"ayo\" and is constantly muttering. Long's right-hand man, Sanyo was created from Long's body. After Long entered Rio's service Sanyo drags in the large wooden coffin holding Suugu, unsuccessfully sending his apprentices to convince Rio of their power. His habit of blabbering hints of Long's true plans for Rio cause Mere to force him to reveal what he knows. He battles the Gekirangers to keep them from Mere and is defeated by her and Geki Blue, Yellow, Violet and Chopper. Surviving the battle because of his immortality, Sanyo serves his purpose to recreate Long but is reabsorbed by Long when he assumed his true form and full power. His name is based on Su\u0101n Y\u016d ({{lang|zh|\u9178\u8207}}) of the [[Shan Hai Jing]], and his motifs are the [[Black Tortoise]] and the [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]] of the [[Earthly Branches]].

Suugu was made by Long from Dan's Geki soul, without his mind. Suugu was awakened by Long in the presence of Rio, who recognizes him as Dan; this led to Rio embracing the Gen J\u016bken. Although he is mindless, part of Dan seems to remain in Suugu, who plays a leaf [[ocarina]]. Long tricks Rio into ordering Suugu to kill Jyan. During this battle, Suguu's memories as Dan reawakened, allowing him to overcome the Blood Oath's effect and take the blow Long intended for Jyan. Mortally wounded, Suugu has Jyan deal the deathblow to release Dan's soul from his physical prison. His name is based on S\u014du Y\u00fa ({{lang|zh|\u9a36\u865e}}) of the [[Shi Jing]], and his motifs are the [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]] and the [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]] of the [[Earthly Branches]]. Suugu is voiced by veteran Tokusatsu actor {{nihongo|[[Kenji Ohba]]|\u5927\u8449 \u5065\u4e8c|\u014cba Kenji}} who also portrayed Dan.\n\n==={{anchor|The Twin Gensi}}Twin Gensi===\nThe {{nihongo|Twin Gensi|\u53cc\u5e7b\u58eb|S\u014dgenshi}} are apprentices who support the Four Genshou:\n\n====Sanyo's Gensi====\n* {{nihongo|Gouyu|\u30b4\u30a6\u30e6|G\u014dyu|37\u201345}}: Master of the {{nihongo|Gen J\u016b [[Catoblepas]]-Ken|\u5e7b\u7363\u30b1\u30a4\u30c8\u30b9\u62f3|Gen J\u016b Keitosuken}} which uses sound-based attacks, chatting while fighting. He is the Gekirangers' first Gen J\u016bken opponent. He nearly defeats SaiDaiOh, GekiTohja Wolf and Geki Fire until GekiElephantFire damages him, although he survives the fight with the aid of Sanyo (who defeats all three opponents). He appears again to protect Rio from Gou, only to be destroyed in seconds by Gou's Heaven and Earth Disaster Strike. His name is based on H\u00e9 Y\u016d (\u5408\u7ab3) of the [[Shan Hai Jing]], and his motif is the [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]] of the [[Earthly Branches]].

He uses his {{nihongo|Mythical Reflection Mirror|\u5e7b\u5c04\u93e1|Genshaky\u014d}} armor to perform his mirror-Gengi, using it on Retsu to infiltrate the Gekirangers. Shiyuu is wounded by GekiBatTohja Wolf before SaiDaiOh lands the death blow. Shiyuu uses mirrors for his attacks but hates to be imitated, leading him to use strange words so it is difficult to emulate him. His name is based on [[Chi You|Ch\u012b Y\u00f3u]] ({{lang|zh|\u86a9\u5c24}}), and his motif is the [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]] of the [[Earthly Branches]].

Although she is Mere's apprentice, her loyalty lies with Long as she tries to keep the others away from him and Rio. She is destroyed by the Geki Beast group. Her name is based on F\u0113i Sh\u016d ({{lang|zh|\u98db\u9f20}}) of the [[Shan Hai Jing]], and her motif is the [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]] of the [[Earthly Branches]].
