He won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[The Lost Thing]]'', a 2011 animated film adaptation of a 2000 picture book he wrote and illustrated. Other books he has written and illustrated include ''[[The Red Tree (Shaun Tan)|The Red Tree]]'' and ''[[The Arrival (graphic novel)|The Arrival]]''.\n\nTan was born in [[Fremantle]], Western Australia, and grew up in the northern suburbs of [[Perth]], Western Australia. In 2006, his wordless [[graphic novel]] ''The Arrival'' won the Book of the Year prize as part of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]].<ref>{{Citation|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald| url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/2007-nsw-premiers-literary-awards/2007/05/29/1180205249745.html | title = 2007 NSW Premier's Literary Awards | date = 30 May 2007}}</ref> The same book won the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]] [[Children's Book of the Year Award: Picture Book|Picture Book of the Year]] award in 2007.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://cbc.org.au/winner07.htm | publisher = CBCA | title = Book of the Year Awards | contribution = Winners 2007}}.</ref> and the [[Western Australian Premier's Book Awards]] Premier's Prize in 2006.<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Shaun Tan | contribution-url = http://pba.slwa.wa.gov.au/hall_of_fame/shaun_tan | title = Premier's Book Awards Hall of Fame | publisher = [[State Library of Western Australia]]}}.</ref>\n\nTan's work has been described as an \"Australian vernacular\" that is \"at once banal and uncanny, familiar and strange, local and universal, reassuring and scary, intimate and remote, [[Street children|guttersnipe]] and [[sprezzatura]].

At school he was known as a talented artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography: Shaun Tan|url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/shaun-tan|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> At the age of eleven, he became a fan of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' television series as well as books that bore similar themes. Tan cites [[Ray Bradbury]] as a favorite at this time. These stories led to Tan writing his own short stories. Of his effort at writing as a youth, Tan tells, \"I have a small pile of rejection letters as testament to this ambition!\"<ref name=\"locusmag\">{{cite journal |title=Shaun Tan: Out of Context |first=Karen |last=Haber |journal=Locus |issue=12 |date=December 2001 |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2001/Issue12/Tan.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> At the age of sixteen, Tan's first illustration appeared in the Australian magazine ''[[Aurealis]]'' in 1990.<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\n===Transition to illustration===\nTan almost studied to become a geneticist, and enjoyed chemistry, physics, history and English while in high school as well as art and claimed that he did not really know what he wanted to do.<ref name= \"locusmag\" /> During his university studies, Tan decided to move from academic studies to working as an artist.<ref name=\"hsc\">{{Citation | title = Visual arts requirements case studies | contribution = Shaun Tan | contribution-url = http://hsc.csu.edu.au/visual_arts/requirements/case_studies/illustrator_graphic_designer/122232ShaTanCDoc5.html | publisher = NSW HSC Online}}.</ref>\n\nTan continued his education at the [[University of Western Australia]] where he studied Fine Arts, English Literature and History. While this was of interest to him, there was little practical work involved.<ref name =\"hsc\" /> In 1995, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.austlit.edu.au/run?ex=ShowAgent&agentId=A%2C%7D9 | publisher = AustLit | title = Agent}}.</ref>\n\n===Work process===\nInitially, Tan works in black and white because the final reproductions would be printed that way. Some black and white mediums he uses include pens, inks, acrylics, charcoal, scraperboard, photocopies, and linocuts.<ref name=\"locusmag\" /> Tan's current colour works still begin in black and white. He uses a graphite pencil to make sketches on ordinary copy paper. The sketches are then reproduced numerous times with different versions varying with parts added or removed. Sometimes scissors are used for this purpose. The cut and paste [[collage]] idea in these early stages is often extend to the finished production with many of his illustrations using such materials as \"glass, metal, cuttings from other books and dead insects\".<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\nTan describes himself as a slow worker who revises his work many times along the way. He is interested in loss and alienation, and believes that children in particular react well to issues of natural justice. He feels he is \"like a translator\" of ideas, and is happy and flattered to see his work adapted and interpreted in film and music (such as by the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]]).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/stories/2008/2258905.htm|title=Shaun Tan: ''Tales from Outer Suburbia''|publisher=[[ABC Radio National]]|work=[[The Book Show]]|date=29 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nTan draws from a large source of inspiration and cites many influences on his work. His comment on the subject is: \"I\u2019m pretty omnivorous when it comes to influences, and I like to admit this openly.\"<ref name = \"locusmag\" /> Some influences are very direct.

He won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[The Lost Thing]]'', a 2011 animated film adaptation of a 2000 picture book he wrote and illustrated. Other books he has written and illustrated include ''[[The Red Tree (Shaun Tan)|The Red Tree]]'' and ''[[The Arrival (graphic novel)|The Arrival]]''.\n\nTan was born in [[Fremantle]], Western Australia, and grew up in the northern suburbs of [[Perth]], Western Australia. In 2006, his wordless [[graphic novel]] ''The Arrival'' won the Book of the Year prize as part of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]].<ref>{{Citation|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald| url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/2007-nsw-premiers-literary-awards/2007/05/29/1180205249745.html | title = 2007 NSW Premier's Literary Awards | date = 30 May 2007}}</ref> The same book won the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]] [[Children's Book of the Year Award: Picture Book|Picture Book of the Year]] award in 2007.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://cbc.org.au/winner07.htm | publisher = CBCA | title = Book of the Year Awards | contribution = Winners 2007}}.</ref> and the [[Western Australian Premier's Book Awards]] Premier's Prize in 2006.<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Shaun Tan | contribution-url = http://pba.slwa.wa.gov.au/hall_of_fame/shaun_tan | title = Premier's Book Awards Hall of Fame | publisher = [[State Library of Western Australia]]}}.</ref>\n\nTan's work has been described as an \"Australian vernacular\" that is \"at once banal and uncanny, familiar and strange, local and universal, reassuring and scary, intimate and remote, [[Street children|guttersnipe]] and [[sprezzatura]].

At school he was known as a talented artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography: Shaun Tan|url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/shaun-tan|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> At the age of eleven, he became a fan of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' television series as well as books that bore similar themes. Tan cites [[Ray Bradbury]] as a favorite at this time. These stories led to Tan writing his own short stories. Of his effort at writing as a youth, Tan tells, \"I have a small pile of rejection letters as testament to this ambition!\"<ref name=\"locusmag\">{{cite journal |title=Shaun Tan: Out of Context |first=Karen |last=Haber |journal=Locus |issue=12 |date=December 2001 |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2001/Issue12/Tan.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> At the age of sixteen, Tan's first illustration appeared in the Australian magazine ''[[Aurealis]]'' in 1990.<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\n===Transition to illustration===\nTan almost studied to become a geneticist, and enjoyed chemistry, physics, history and English while in high school as well as art and claimed that he did not really know what he wanted to do.<ref name= \"locusmag\" /> During his university studies, Tan decided to move from academic studies to working as an artist.<ref name=\"hsc\">{{Citation | title = Visual arts requirements case studies | contribution = Shaun Tan | contribution-url = http://hsc.csu.edu.au/visual_arts/requirements/case_studies/illustrator_graphic_designer/122232ShaTanCDoc5.html | publisher = NSW HSC Online}}.</ref>\n\nTan continued his education at the [[University of Western Australia]] where he studied Fine Arts, English Literature and History. While this was of interest to him, there was little practical work involved.<ref name =\"hsc\" /> In 1995, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.austlit.edu.au/run?ex=ShowAgent&agentId=A%2C%7D9 | publisher = AustLit | title = Agent}}.</ref>\n\n===Work process===\nInitially, Tan works in black and white because the final reproductions would be printed that way. Some black and white mediums he uses include pens, inks, acrylics, charcoal, scraperboard, photocopies, and linocuts.<ref name=\"locusmag\" /> Tan's current colour works still begin in black and white. He uses a graphite pencil to make sketches on ordinary copy paper. The sketches are then reproduced numerous times with different versions varying with parts added or removed. Sometimes scissors are used for this purpose. The cut and paste [[collage]] idea in these early stages is often extend to the finished production with many of his illustrations using such materials as \"glass, metal, cuttings from other books and dead insects\".<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\nTan describes himself as a slow worker who revises his work many times along the way. He is interested in loss and alienation, and believes that children in particular react well to issues of natural justice. He feels he is \"like a translator\" of ideas, and is happy and flattered to see his work adapted and interpreted in film and music (such as by the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]]).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/stories/2008/2258905.htm|title=Shaun Tan: ''Tales from Outer Suburbia''|publisher=[[ABC Radio National]]|work=[[The Book Show]]|date=29 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nTan draws from a large source of inspiration and cites many influences on his work. His comment on the subject is: \"I\u2019m pretty omnivorous when it comes to influences, and I like to admit this openly.\"<ref name = \"locusmag\" /> Some influences are very direct.

It is sold worldwide as a physical magazine, and as a digital download for the [[iPad]] and [[iPhone]] via the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], and for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices via the [[Android Market]]. The first issue of ''attitude'' appeared in May 1994. A separate Thai edition was published from March 2011 to April 2018, a Vietnamese edition launched in November 2013, and editions in Belgium and the Netherlands launched in February 2017.\n\n==History of ownership==\n{{unsourced section|date=February 2019}}\n''attitude'' began publication in 1994 as part of the [[Northern and Shell]] Group owned by [[Richard Desmond]], and having been through a succession of owners subsequent to its sale in 2004 (commensurate with Desmond's takeover of Express Newspapers) it was acquired in September 2016 by contract publisher Stream Publishing. The owner of Stream Publishing, Darren Styles, had previously launched the successful ''attitude'' ''awards'' for the brand (in October 2012) and acquired the English-language rights to ''Winq'', the luxury lifestyle magazine for gay men, from its Amsterdam-based owner (the Media Mansion) in August 2013.\n\n==Content==\nCelebrities who have appeared on the cover include [[Prince William]],  [[Boy George]],  [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]],  [[David Beckham]],  [[Michael Sam]], [[Lady Gaga]],   [[Tom Daley]], [[Rupaul]], [[Tom Hardy]],  [[Gareth Thomas (rugby)|Gareth Thomas]], [[Ian Somerhalder]], [[John Grant (musician)|John Grant]],  [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[Jonathan Groff]], [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]], [[Tony Blair]], [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Heath Ledger]], [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as [[Br\u00fcno (character)|Br\u00fcno]], [[David Cameron]], [[Ed Miliband]], [[Robbie Rogers]], [[The Spice Girls]], [[Take That]], [[James Franco]], [[Dominic Cooper]], [[James Anderson (cricketer)|Jimmy Anderson]], [[Nick Jonas]],  [[Jussie Smollett]] with  [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Mark Feehily]], [[Kevin McDaid]], [[Kylie Minogue]],  [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Elton John]], [[McFly]], [[Nicola Adams]],  [[Robbie Williams]], [[Rupert Everett]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Philip Olivier]], [[Freddie Ljungberg]], [[Marina and the Diamonds]], [[George Michael]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Will Young]], [[Harry Judd]] of [[McFly]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Dermot O'Leary]], [[John Barrowman]], [[Gary Lucy]], [[Beth Ditto]], [[Cheyenne Jackson]], [[Scissor Sisters]], [[Adam Lambert]] and [[Liam Payne]]. Many of these covers have been world exclusives. ''Attitude'' published a cover featuring [[Alan Turing]] in October 13 as part of its 'Attitude Awards' edition.\n\n[[Tony Blair]] gave the first interview a serving [[Prime Minister]] has ever given a gay publication in May 2005. He gave his second ever gay press interview to mark ''attitude'''s 15th birthday in May 2009.\n\nIn February 2010 former Conservative party leader [[David Cameron]] appeared on the cover of ''attitude'' giving his first interview to a gay publication.\n\nFor the August 2009 issue, [[Harry Potter]] star [[Daniel Radcliffe]] gave his first interview to a gay publication in which he announced his support for British political party the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. He said, \"I just loathe homophobia. It's just disgusting and animal and stupid and it's just thick people who can't get their heads around it and are just scared. I grew up around gay people entirely.

In June 1914 it was shortened to ''Hearst's'' and was ultimately titled ''Hearst's International'' in May 1922. In order to spare serious cutbacks at [[Hearst Castle|San Simeon]], Hearst merged the magazine ''Hearst's International'' with ''Cosmopolitan'' effective March 1925. But while the ''Cosmopolitan'' title on the cover remained at a [[typeface]] of eight-four [[Point (typography)|points]], over time span the typeface of the ''Hearst's International'' decreased to thirty-six points and then to a barely legible twelve points.

In 1911, Hearst had bought a middling monthly magazine called ''World To-Day'' and renamed it ''Hearst's Magazine'' in April 1912. In June 1914 it was shortened to ''Hearst's'' and was ultimately titled ''Hearst's International'' in May 1922. In order to spare serious cutbacks at [[Hearst Castle|San Simeon]], Hearst merged the magazine ''Hearst's International'' with ''Cosmopolitan'' effective March 1925. But while the ''Cosmopolitan'' title on the cover remained at a [[typeface]] of eight-four [[Point (typography)|points]], over time span the typeface of the ''Hearst's International'' decreased to thirty-six points and then to a barely legible twelve points. After Hearst died in 1951, the ''Hearst's International'' disappeared from the magazine cover altogether in April 1952.<ref>{{cite book |last= Landers|first= James |year= 2010|title=The Improbable First Century of Cosmopolitan Magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/improbablefirstc0000land|url-access= registration|location= |publisher= [[University of Missouri Press]]|isbn= 9780826272331|pages = [https://archive.org/details/improbablefirstc0000land/page/169 169\u2013213] }}</ref>\n\nWith a circulation of 1,700,000 in the 1930s, ''Cosmopolitan'' had an advertising income of $5,000,000.

Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably \"corny\" humor publications such as ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'', where he had worked, or the old ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann (who founded the General Baking Company<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/timeline Newyorker.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107183533/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/timeline |date=November 7, 2013 }}</ref>) to establish the F-R Publishing Company. The magazine's first offices were at 25 West 45th Street in [[Manhattan]]. Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951. During the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication. Ross famously declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine: \"It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]].\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E2D81730F936A3575BC0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 ''Dubuque Journal; The Slight That Years, All 75, Can't Erase''], Dirk Johnson, ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 5, 1999.</ref>\n\nAlthough the magazine never lost its touches of humor, it soon established itself as a pre-eminent forum for serious [[fiction]], [[essays]] and journalism. Shortly after the end of [[World War II]], [[John Hersey]]'s essay ''[[Hiroshima (book)|Hiroshima]]'' filled an entire issue. In subsequent decades the magazine published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including [[Ann Beattie]], [[Sally Benson]], [[Truman Capote]], [[John Cheever]], [[Roald Dahl]], [[Mavis Gallant]], [[Geoffrey T. Hellman|Geoffrey Hellman]], [[Ruth McKenney]], [[John McNulty (journalist)|John McNulty]], [[Joseph Mitchell (writer)|Joseph Mitchell]], [[Alice Munro]], [[Haruki Murakami]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[John O'Hara]], [[Dorothy Parker]], [[S.J. Perelman]], [[Philip Roth]], [[J. D. Salinger]], [[Irwin Shaw]], [[James Thurber]], [[John Updike]], [[Eudora Welty]], [[Stephen King]], and [[E. B. White]]. Publication of [[Shirley Jackson]]'s \"[[The Lottery]]\" drew more mail than any other story in the magazine's history.<ref name=\"Lottery letters\">{{cite web | title= 'The Lottery' Letters |url= https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-lottery-letters | last= Franklin | first= Ruth| date= June 25, 2013| website= www.newyorker.com |publisher= [[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]| accessdate= June 11, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn its early decades, the magazine sometimes published two or even three short stories a week, but in recent years the pace has remained steady at one story per issue. While some styles and themes recur more often than others in its fiction, the stories are marked less by uniformity than by variety, and they have ranged from Updike's introspective domestic narratives to the surrealism of [[Donald Barthelme]], and from parochial accounts of the lives of neurotic New Yorkers to stories set in a wide range of locations and eras and translated from many languages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Kurt Vonnegut]] said that ''The New Yorker'' has been an effective instrument for getting a large audience to appreciate modern literature. Vonnegut's 1974 interview with Joe David Bellamy and John Casey contained a discussion of ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s influence:\n\n{{quote|[T]he limiting factor [in literature] is the reader. No other art requires the audience to be a performer.

Those writers you mentioned and myself are teaching an audience how to play this kind of music in their heads. It's a learning process, and ''The New Yorker'' has been a very good institution of the sort needed. They have a captive audience, and they come out every week, and people finally catch on to Barthelme, for instance, and are able to perform that sort of thing in their heads and enjoy it.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Vonnegut |first=Kurt |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=William Rodney |year=1988 |title=Conversations with Kurt Vonnegut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLQeOR_m2YMC&pg=PA164 |location=Jackson, MI |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |pages=163\u2013164 |isbn=9780878053575 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe non-fiction feature articles (which usually make up the bulk of the magazine's content) cover an eclectic array of topics. Recent{{when|date= June 2018}} subjects have included eccentric evangelist [[Creflo Dollar]], the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time, and [[M\u00fcnchausen syndrome by proxy]].\n\nThe magazine is notable for its editorial traditions. Under the rubric ''Profiles'', it publishes articles about notable people such as [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Henry Luce|Henry R. Luce]] and [[Marlon Brando]], Hollywood restaurateur [[Michael Romanoff]], magician [[Ricky Jay]] and mathematicians [[Chudnovsky brothers|David and Gregory Chudnovsky]]. Other enduring features have been \"Goings on About Town\", a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York, and \"The Talk of the Town\", a miscellany of brief pieces\u2014frequently humorous, whimsical or eccentric vignettes of life in New York\u2014written in a breezily light style, or [[feuilleton]], although in recent years the section often begins with a serious commentary. For many years, newspaper snippets containing amusing errors, unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors (\"Block That Metaphor\") have been used as filler items, accompanied by a witty retort. There is no masthead listing the editors and staff. Despite some changes, the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography, layout, covers and artwork. The magazine was acquired by [[Advance Publications]], the media company owned by [[Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr.|Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr]], in 1985,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fM4yPDNHtHQC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=1984+newhouse+the+new+yorker&source=bl&ots=hLjG21JJoL&sig=foiz-NvKm9UJGBa6IvIwYEwqSqo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEYQ6AEwCWoVChMIhYush8-ExwIVg6A-Ch020g84#v=onepage&q=1984%20newhouse%20the%20new%20yorker&f=false|last=Easley|first=Greg|work=[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]|title=The New Yorker: When a Magazine Wins Awards But Loses Money, the Only Success is the Editor's Private One|date=October 1995|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}</ref> for $200&nbsp;million when it was earning less than $6&nbsp;million a year.<ref name=\"mahon19890910\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/magazine/si-newhouse-and-conde-nast-taking-off-the-white-gloves.html?pagewanted=all |title=S.I.

Among the important nonfiction authors who began writing for the magazine during Shawn's editorship were [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Kenneth Tynan]], and [[Hannah Arendt]]; to a certain extent all three authors were controversial, Arendt the most obviously so{{according to whom|date= June 2018}} (her ''Eichmann in Jerusalem'' reportage appeared in the magazine before it was published as a book), but in each case Shawn proved an active champion.\n\nBrown's nearly six-year tenure attracted more controversy than Gottlieb's or even Shawn's, thanks to her high profile (Shawn, by contrast, had been an extremely shy, introverted figure) and the changes which she made to a magazine that had retained a similar look and feel for the previous half-century. She introduced color to the editorial pages (several years before ''[[The New York Times]]'') and photography, with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout. More substantively, she increased the coverage of current events and hot topics such as celebrities and business tycoons, and placed short pieces throughout \"Goings on About Town\", including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan.

His book ''The Art of the New Yorker: 1925\u20131995'' (Knopf, 1995) was the first comprehensive survey of all aspects of the magazine's graphics. In 1998, [[Robert Mankoff]] took over as cartoon editor and edited at least 14 collections of ''New Yorker'' cartoons. In addition, Mankoff usually contributed a short article to each book, describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine. Mankoff left the magazine in 2017.<ref>Cavna, Michael.

In his book ''The Years with Ross'', Thurber describes the newspaper's weekly art meeting, where cartoons submitted over the previous week would be brought up from the mail room to be gone over by Ross, the editorial department, and a number of staff writers. Cartoons often would be rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments, while others would be accepted and captions written for them. Some artists hired their own writers; Helen Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in 1931. ([[Brendan Gill]] relates in his book ''Here at The New Yorker'' that at one point in the early 1940s, the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve. It later was found out that the office boy (a teen-aged [[Truman Capote]]) had been acting as a volunteer art editor, dropping pieces he didn't like down the far edge of his desk.)<ref>Gill, Brendan. ''Here at The New Yorker''. New York: Berkley Medallion Press, 1976. p. 341.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the magazine's cartoons have climbed to a higher plateau of fame. One 1928 cartoon drawn by [[Carl Rose (cartoonist)|Carl Rose]] and captioned by [[E.&nbsp;B. White]] shows a mother telling her daughter, \"It's broccoli, dear.\" The daughter responds, \"I say it's spinach and I say the hell with it.\" The phrase \"[[I say it's spinach]]\" entered the vernacular (and three years later, the Broadway musical ''Face the Music'' included [[Irving Berlin]]'s musical number entitled \"[[I Say It's Spinach (And the Hell with It)]]\").<ref>Gill (1976), p. 220.</ref> The [[catchphrase]] \"[[wikt:back to the drawing board|back to the drawing board]]\" originated with the 1941 Peter Arno cartoon showing an engineer walking away from a crashed plane, saying, \"Well, back to the old drawing board.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmaslin.com/index.php?page=finding-arno|title=Michael Maslin \u2013 Finding Arno|publisher=|access-date=May 30, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917221618/http://michaelmaslin.com/index.php?page=finding-arno|archive-date=September 17, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/arno11.jpg|title=CBR.com \u2013 The World's Top Destination For Comic, Movie & TV news|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe most reprinted is [[Peter Steiner (cartoonist)|Peter Steiner]]'s 1993 drawing of two dogs at a computer, with one saying, \"[[On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog]]\". According to Mankoff, Steiner and the magazine have split more than $100,000 in fees paid for the licensing and reprinting of this single cartoon, with more than half going to Steiner.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/14/technology/14DOGG.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5070&en=f0518aafeccf36fd&ex=1183089600|title=Cartoon Captures Spirit of the Internet|first=Glenn|last=Fleishman|work=The New York Times|date=December 14, 2000|accessdate=October 1, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416205920/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/14/technology/14DOGG.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5070&en=f0518aafeccf36fd&ex=1183089600 |archivedate=April 16, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html Peter Steiner's \"On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.\"]</ref>\n\nOver seven decades, many hardcover compilations of cartoons from ''The New Yorker'' have been published, and in 2004, Mankoff edited ''The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker'', a 656-page collection with 2004 of the magazine's best cartoons published during 80 years, plus a double CD set with all 68,647 cartoons ever published in the magazine. This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by a cartoonist's name or by year of publication. The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includes [[Pat Byrnes]], Frank Cotham, Michael Crawford, Joe Dator, Drew Dernavich, [[J. C. Duffy]], Carolita Johnson, Zachary Kanin, Farley Katz, [[Robert Leighton (cartoonist)|Robert Leighton]], Glen Le Lievre, [[Michael Maslin]], Ariel Molvig, Paul Noth, Barbara Smaller, David Sipress, Mick Stevens, [[Julia Suits]], Christopher Weyant, [[P. C. Vey]], and Jack Ziegler. The notion that some ''New Yorker'' cartoons have punchlines so ''[[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequitur]]'' that they are impossible to understand became a subplot in the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode \"[[The Cartoon]]\", as well as a playful jab in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', \"[[The Sweetest Apu]]\".\n\nIn April 2005, the magazine began using the last page of each issue for \"The New Yorker Cartoon [[Caption Contest]]\". Captionless cartoons by ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s regular cartoonists are printed each week. Captions are submitted by readers, and three are chosen as finalists. Readers then vote on the winner. Anyone age thirteen or older can enter or vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Caption Contest Rules |url=https://www.newyorker.com/about/caption-contest-rules |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref> Each contest winner receives a print of the cartoon (with the winning caption), signed by the artist who drew the cartoon.\n\n== Crosswords and Puzzles ==\nThe New Yorker launched a crossword puzzle series in April 2018 with a weekday crossword published every Monday. Subsequently, it launched a second, weekend crossword that appears on Fridays and relaunched cryptic puzzles that were run in the magazine in the late 1990s. The puzzles are written by a rotating stable of seven constructors. The crosswords integrate cartoons into the puzzle playing experience. The Christmas 2019 issue featured a crossword puzzle by Patrick Berry that had cartoons as clues, and the answers were captions for the cartoons. In December 2019, Liz Maynes-Aminzade was named the first puzzles and games editor of The New Yorker.\n\n== Films ==\n''The New Yorker'' has been the source of a number of movies. Both fiction and non-fiction pieces have been adapted for the big screen, including ''[[Flash of Genius (film)|Flash of Genius]]'' (2008), based on a true account of the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper by [[John Seabrook]]; ''[[Away From Her]]'', adapted from Alice Munro's short story \"The Bear Came over the Mountain\", which debuted at the 2007 [[Sundance Film Festival]]; ''[[The Namesake (film)|The Namesake]]'' (2007), similarly based on [[Jhumpa Lahiri]]'s novel, which originated as a short story in the magazine; ''[[The Bridge (2006 documentary film)|The Bridge]]'' (2006), based on [[Tad Friend]]'s 2003 non-fiction piece \"Jumpers\"; ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005), an adaptation of the short story by [[E.

The magazine's former editor, [[William Shawn]], is portrayed in ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'' (2005), ''[[Infamous (film)|Infamous]]'' (2006) and ''[[Hannah Arendt (film)|Hannah Arendt]]'' (2012).\n\nThe 2015 documentary ''Very Semi-Serious'', produced by Redora Films, presents a behind-the-scenes look at the cartoons of ''The New Yorker''. \n<!-- Commented out: [[File:New Yorker 1980 10 27 p194.jpg|frame|Example of former [[semicolon]] usage from issue of October 27, 1980.

The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square, with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing [[New Jersey|\"Jersey\"]], the names of five cities ([[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]; [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]; and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]) and three states ([[Texas]], [[Utah]], and [[Nebraska]]) scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey. The Pacific Ocean, perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson, separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia.\n\nThe illustration\u2014humorously depicting New Yorkers' self-image of their place in the world, or perhaps outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image\u2014inspired many similar works, including the poster for the [[1984 in film|1984 film]] ''[[Moscow on the Hudson]]''; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, ''[[Steinberg v.

Supp. 706 ([[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|S.D.N.Y.]] 1987), which held that [[Columbia Pictures]] violated the [[copyright]] that Steinberg held on his work.\n\nThe cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of ''The New Yorker'' on October 6, 2008.

The cover created by Fran\u00e7oise Mouly and Spiegelman for the September 24, 2001, issue of ''The New Yorker'' received wide acclaim and was voted as being among the top ten magazine covers of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors, which commented:\n{{quote|''New Yorker'' Covers Editor Fran\u00e7oise Mouly repositioned Art Spiegelman's silhouettes, inspired by [[Ad Reinhardt]]'s black-on-black paintings, so that the North Tower's antenna breaks the \"W\" of the magazine's logo.

The silhouetted Twin Towers were printed in a fifth, black ink, on a field of black made up of the standard four color printing inks. An overprinted clear varnish helps create the ghost images that linger, insisting on their presence through the blackness.}}\n\nAt first glance, the cover appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers in a slightly darker shade of black.

Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably \"corny\" humor publications such as ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'', where he had worked, or the old ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann (who founded the General Baking Company<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/timeline Newyorker.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107183533/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/timeline |date=November 7, 2013 }}</ref>) to establish the F-R Publishing Company. The magazine's first offices were at 25 West 45th Street in [[Manhattan]]. Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951. During the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication. Ross famously declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine: \"It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]].\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E2D81730F936A3575BC0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 ''Dubuque Journal; The Slight That Years, All 75, Can't Erase''], Dirk Johnson, ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 5, 1999.</ref>\n\nAlthough the magazine never lost its touches of humor, it soon established itself as a pre-eminent forum for serious [[fiction]], [[essays]] and journalism. Shortly after the end of [[World War II]], [[John Hersey]]'s essay ''[[Hiroshima (book)|Hiroshima]]'' filled an entire issue. In subsequent decades the magazine published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including [[Ann Beattie]], [[Sally Benson]], [[Truman Capote]], [[John Cheever]], [[Roald Dahl]], [[Mavis Gallant]], [[Geoffrey T. Hellman|Geoffrey Hellman]], [[Ruth McKenney]], [[John McNulty (journalist)|John McNulty]], [[Joseph Mitchell (writer)|Joseph Mitchell]], [[Alice Munro]], [[Haruki Murakami]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[John O'Hara]], [[Dorothy Parker]], [[S.J. Perelman]], [[Philip Roth]], [[J. D. Salinger]], [[Irwin Shaw]], [[James Thurber]], [[John Updike]], [[Eudora Welty]], [[Stephen King]], and [[E. B. White]]. Publication of [[Shirley Jackson]]'s \"[[The Lottery]]\" drew more mail than any other story in the magazine's history.<ref name=\"Lottery letters\">{{cite web | title= 'The Lottery' Letters |url= https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-lottery-letters | last= Franklin | first= Ruth| date= June 25, 2013| website= www.newyorker.com |publisher= [[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]| accessdate= June 11, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn its early decades, the magazine sometimes published two or even three short stories a week, but in recent years the pace has remained steady at one story per issue. While some styles and themes recur more often than others in its fiction, the stories are marked less by uniformity than by variety, and they have ranged from Updike's introspective domestic narratives to the surrealism of [[Donald Barthelme]], and from parochial accounts of the lives of neurotic New Yorkers to stories set in a wide range of locations and eras and translated from many languages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Kurt Vonnegut]] said that ''The New Yorker'' has been an effective instrument for getting a large audience to appreciate modern literature. Vonnegut's 1974 interview with Joe David Bellamy and John Casey contained a discussion of ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s influence:\n\n{{quote|[T]he limiting factor [in literature] is the reader. No other art requires the audience to be a performer. You have to count on the reader's being a good performer, and you may write music which he absolutely can't perform\u2014in which case it's a bust. Those writers you mentioned and myself are teaching an audience how to play this kind of music in their heads. It's a learning process, and ''The New Yorker'' has been a very good institution of the sort needed. They have a captive audience, and they come out every week, and people finally catch on to Barthelme, for instance, and are able to perform that sort of thing in their heads and enjoy it.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Vonnegut |first=Kurt |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=William Rodney |year=1988 |title=Conversations with Kurt Vonnegut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLQeOR_m2YMC&pg=PA164 |location=Jackson, MI |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |pages=163\u2013164 |isbn=9780878053575 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe non-fiction feature articles (which usually make up the bulk of the magazine's content) cover an eclectic array of topics. Recent{{when|date= June 2018}} subjects have included eccentric evangelist [[Creflo Dollar]], the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time, and [[M\u00fcnchausen syndrome by proxy]].\n\nThe magazine is notable for its editorial traditions. Under the rubric ''Profiles'', it publishes articles about notable people such as [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Henry Luce|Henry R. Luce]] and [[Marlon Brando]], Hollywood restaurateur [[Michael Romanoff]], magician [[Ricky Jay]] and mathematicians [[Chudnovsky brothers|David and Gregory Chudnovsky]]. Other enduring features have been \"Goings on About Town\", a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York, and \"The Talk of the Town\", a miscellany of brief pieces\u2014frequently humorous, whimsical or eccentric vignettes of life in New York\u2014written in a breezily light style, or [[feuilleton]], although in recent years the section often begins with a serious commentary. For many years, newspaper snippets containing amusing errors, unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors (\"Block That Metaphor\") have been used as filler items, accompanied by a witty retort. There is no masthead listing the editors and staff. Despite some changes, the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography, layout, covers and artwork. The magazine was acquired by [[Advance Publications]], the media company owned by [[Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr.|Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr]], in 1985,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fM4yPDNHtHQC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=1984+newhouse+the+new+yorker&source=bl&ots=hLjG21JJoL&sig=foiz-NvKm9UJGBa6IvIwYEwqSqo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEYQ6AEwCWoVChMIhYush8-ExwIVg6A-Ch020g84#v=onepage&q=1984%20newhouse%20the%20new%20yorker&f=false|last=Easley|first=Greg|work=[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]|title=The New Yorker: When a Magazine Wins Awards But Loses Money, the Only Success is the Editor's Private One|date=October 1995|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}</ref> for $200&nbsp;million when it was earning less than $6&nbsp;million a year.<ref name=\"mahon19890910\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/magazine/si-newhouse-and-conde-nast-taking-off-the-white-gloves.html?pagewanted=all |title=S.I.

Among the important nonfiction authors who began writing for the magazine during Shawn's editorship were [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Kenneth Tynan]], and [[Hannah Arendt]]; to a certain extent all three authors were controversial, Arendt the most obviously so{{according to whom|date= June 2018}} (her ''Eichmann in Jerusalem'' reportage appeared in the magazine before it was published as a book), but in each case Shawn proved an active champion.\n\nBrown's nearly six-year tenure attracted more controversy than Gottlieb's or even Shawn's, thanks to her high profile (Shawn, by contrast, had been an extremely shy, introverted figure) and the changes which she made to a magazine that had retained a similar look and feel for the previous half-century. She introduced color to the editorial pages (several years before ''[[The New York Times]]'') and photography, with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout. More substantively, she increased the coverage of current events and hot topics such as celebrities and business tycoons, and placed short pieces throughout \"Goings on About Town\", including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan. A new letters-to-the-editor page and the addition of authors' bylines to their \"Talk of the Town\" pieces had the effect of making the magazine more personal.

In his book ''The Years with Ross'', Thurber describes the newspaper's weekly art meeting, where cartoons submitted over the previous week would be brought up from the mail room to be gone over by Ross, the editorial department, and a number of staff writers. Cartoons often would be rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments, while others would be accepted and captions written for them. Some artists hired their own writers; Helen Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in 1931. ([[Brendan Gill]] relates in his book ''Here at The New Yorker'' that at one point in the early 1940s, the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve. It later was found out that the office boy (a teen-aged [[Truman Capote]]) had been acting as a volunteer art editor, dropping pieces he didn't like down the far edge of his desk.)<ref>Gill, Brendan.

This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by a cartoonist's name or by year of publication. The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includes [[Pat Byrnes]], Frank Cotham, Michael Crawford, Joe Dator, Drew Dernavich, [[J. C. Duffy]], Carolita Johnson, Zachary Kanin, Farley Katz, [[Robert Leighton (cartoonist)|Robert Leighton]], Glen Le Lievre, [[Michael Maslin]], Ariel Molvig, Paul Noth, Barbara Smaller, David Sipress, Mick Stevens, [[Julia Suits]], Christopher Weyant, [[P. C. Vey]], and Jack Ziegler. The notion that some ''New Yorker'' cartoons have punchlines so ''[[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequitur]]'' that they are impossible to understand became a subplot in the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode \"[[The Cartoon]]\", as well as a playful jab in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', \"[[The Sweetest Apu]]\".\n\nIn April 2005, the magazine began using the last page of each issue for \"The New Yorker Cartoon [[Caption Contest]]\". Captionless cartoons by ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s regular cartoonists are printed each week. Captions are submitted by readers, and three are chosen as finalists. Readers then vote on the winner. Anyone age thirteen or older can enter or vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Caption Contest Rules |url=https://www.newyorker.com/about/caption-contest-rules |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref> Each contest winner receives a print of the cartoon (with the winning caption), signed by the artist who drew the cartoon.\n\n== Crosswords and Puzzles ==\nThe New Yorker launched a crossword puzzle series in April 2018 with a weekday crossword published every Monday. Subsequently, it launched a second, weekend crossword that appears on Fridays and relaunched cryptic puzzles that were run in the magazine in the late 1990s. The puzzles are written by a rotating stable of seven constructors. The crosswords integrate cartoons into the puzzle playing experience. The Christmas 2019 issue featured a crossword puzzle by Patrick Berry that had cartoons as clues, and the answers were captions for the cartoons. In December 2019, Liz Maynes-Aminzade was named the first puzzles and games editor of The New Yorker.\n\n== Films ==\n''The New Yorker'' has been the source of a number of movies. Both fiction and non-fiction pieces have been adapted for the big screen, including ''[[Flash of Genius (film)|Flash of Genius]]'' (2008), based on a true account of the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper by [[John Seabrook]]; ''[[Away From Her]]'', adapted from Alice Munro's short story \"The Bear Came over the Mountain\", which debuted at the 2007 [[Sundance Film Festival]]; ''[[The Namesake (film)|The Namesake]]'' (2007), similarly based on [[Jhumpa Lahiri]]'s novel, which originated as a short story in the magazine; ''[[The Bridge (2006 documentary film)|The Bridge]]'' (2006), based on [[Tad Friend]]'s 2003 non-fiction piece \"Jumpers\"; ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005), an adaptation of the short story by [[E.

The magazine's former editor, [[William Shawn]], is portrayed in ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'' (2005), ''[[Infamous (film)|Infamous]]'' (2006) and ''[[Hannah Arendt (film)|Hannah Arendt]]'' (2012).\n\nThe 2015 documentary ''Very Semi-Serious'', produced by Redora Films, presents a behind-the-scenes look at the cartoons of ''The New Yorker''. \n<!-- Commented out: [[File:New Yorker 1980 10 27 p194.jpg|frame|Example of former [[semicolon]] usage from issue of October 27, 1980.
