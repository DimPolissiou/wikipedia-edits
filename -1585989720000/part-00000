On October 15, 2004, he attended the two-day event in [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice Beach, California]], where he was among eight finalists chosen. After surviving the first day of eliminations he admitted that he was actually 40 years old \u2014 five years over the competition's cut off point \u2014 and not 30 as he'd claimed.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> As a result, he was cut from the competition.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/>\n\nThough he had been cut from ''Tough Enough'', WWE officials invited him to come to their [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]] [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW) for possible training. He trained between January and June 2005, making his OVW debut on June 25, 2005. During a [[dark match]] pitting the team of Seth Skyfire and Robert Fury against Robbie Dawber and his partner, Wright entered the [[Wrestling ring|ring]] and [[Squash match|squashed]] all three men, [[no-sell]]ing the offense of Skyfire in the process. He then announced that he was \"The Boogeyman\" before leaving the building. The Boogeyman [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] further evolved into a \"monster\" [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] who would appear when another wrestler said his name and attack him, while not selling any offense he received.\n\n====SmackDown!

He made his debut on the October 14, 2005 episode of ''SmackDown!'', being brought in by network executive [[Brian Mailhot|Palmer Cannon]] as part of a \"new talent initiative\". The storyline referenced to vignettes months ago as promos for a television series on the network called \"The Boogeyman\". The show was cancelled before it could air, but they still had the actor under contract, so he was brought to SmackDown to wrestle.

On the February 16 edition of ''SmackDown!'' The Boogeyman appeared with a [[Midget wrestling|little person]] of his own, Little Boogeyman, who was portrayed by an actor named Chris Hollyfield. Chris also previously had played Lil Booker T. His purpose was to counteract Hornswoggle, who was proving a problem in one-on-one matches with Finlay. The Boogeyman and the Little Boogeyman lost to Finlay and Hornswoggle in a mixed tag team match at [[No Way Out (2007)|No Way Out]]. The team lost a rematch the following week on ''SmackDown!''; Little Boogeyman was pinned by Finlay, after Wright had chased away Hornswoggle.\n\nOn OVW's 400th anniversary show, The Boogeyman made an appearance, losing to [[Ryan Wilson (wrestler)|Ryan Wilson]] in a tables match. The Boogeyman returned to in ring action when teamed with [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] during his feud with [[The Blue Bloods|William Regal and Dave Taylor]].

On October 15, 2004, he attended the two-day event in [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice Beach, California]], where he was among eight finalists chosen.

He trained between January and June 2005, making his OVW debut on June 25, 2005. During a [[dark match]] pitting the team of Seth Skyfire and Robert Fury against Robbie Dawber and his partner, Wright entered the [[Wrestling ring|ring]] and [[Squash match|squashed]] all three men, [[no-sell]]ing the offense of Skyfire in the process.

At the time large parts of the Australian coast were unmapped and Britain had claimed only part of the continent. The British Government were concerned that, in the event of settlers of another European power becoming established in Australia, any future conflict in Europe would lead to a widening of the conflict into the southern hemisphere to the detriment of the trade that Britain sought to develop. It was against this background that ''Lady Nelson'' was chosen to survey and establish sovereignty over strategic parts of the continent.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' left [[Portsmouth]] on 18 March 1800 and arrived at [[Sydney]] on 16 December 1800 after having been the first vessel to reach the east coast of Australia via [[Bass Strait]]. Prior to that date all vessels had sailed around the southern tip of [[Tasmania]] to reach their destination.\n\n''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s survey work commenced shortly after her arrival at Sydney, initially in the Bass Strait area. She was involved in the discovery of [[Port Phillip]], on the coast of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in establishing settlements on the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]] and at [[Port Dalrymple]] in Tasmania, at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Port Macquarie]] in New South Wales, and on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] off the north coast of the continent.\n\n== Design, building and commissioning ==\nAt the end of the 1790s the New South Wales Colonial Government had no vessels capable of reaching the outside world. ''Supply'' (1793) was found to be unseaworthy in 1797 and was subsequently condemned. {{HMS|Reliance|1793|2}} was also unseaworthy. ''Reliance'' was temporarily repaired to enable her to sail back to England, whither she departed in March 1800. The only other vessel under the control of the colonial government was {{ship||Francis|1793|2}}, a [[schooner]] of only 44 tons (bm). The situation was partially relieved when {{HMS|Buffalo|1797|2}} arrived in May 1799, but the colony possessed no vessels for exploration and surveying.{{efn|''Buffalo'' was a ship of 468 tons (bm). She arrived in Port Jackson on 3 May 1799 with 60 head of cattle on board that she had loaded at the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. ''Buffalo'' returned to the Cape for live cattle again, departing on 13 September 1799, and arriving back in Port Jackson on 16 April 1800. When Governor John Hunter's term of office ended, he elected to take ''Buffalo'' back to England; she departed on 28 September 1800. Following protestations by Philip Gidley King after he became governor, ''Buffalo'' returned to Port Jackson in October 1802.}}\n\nIn 1799 the Admiralty's Commissioners of Transport (the [[Transport Board (Royal Navy)|Transport Board]]), ordered a [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] of 60 tons (bm), to be built for their own use in the River Thames and called it ''Lady Nelson''. Her design followed that of the armed cutter ''Trial'', built in Plymouth in 1789 to a design developed by Captain (later Admiral) [[John Schank|John Schanck]] [often spelled Schank].{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|p=337}} ''Trial'' was unusual in that she had three sliding keels, or centre-boards, that the crew could raise or lower individually.\n\nAt the time there were several other vessels named ''Lady Nelson'' and this has led some authors to write that the vessel, which is the subject of this article, was employed on other duties before being sent to Australia.{{efn|See for example:\n*''The Times'', 20 Nov. 1798, cites a ''Lady Nelson'' with five sliding keels being launched on Tuesday 20 November 1798. This vessel was 'so contrived, that by turning a screw, a stem is formed on her stern, and she will sail the other way without the inconvenience of tacking about';\n*The ''Sun'', 27 Jul. 1799, cited a ''Lady Nelson'', Captain Tate, arrived at Liverpool on 25 July 1799 from Jamaica;\n*''Oracle and Daily Advertiser'' (17 Sep. 1799) reported 'Yesterday [13 Sep. 1799] sailed the ''Lady Nelson'' cutter, on a cruize';\n*''Naval Chronicle'' (Vol. 3, Jan. to Jul. 1800, p. 307.), cites an English cutter ''Lady Nelson'', being taken by French privateers on 21 December 1799 but freed by the actions of Lieutenant Bainbridge of ''Queen Charlotte'';\n*Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p. 238, cites ''Lady Nelson'', Captain Barrow, an ordnance store ship, [departing] 'for Gibraltar' 17 March 1800 in the Portsmouth Report;\n*The ''Naval Chronicle'' (Vol. 3, p. 326), cites from the Plymouth Report 27 March 1800: 'Came in the ''Lady Nelson'', with fruit, captured by a French privateer, and recaptured by the Childers, 16 guns, Captain Crawford';\n*The ''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 4, Jul. to Dec. 1800, p. 245, cites a cutter named ''Lady Nelson'' now [no precise date] being on the Lisbon, Gibraltar, and Mediterranean Stations.}}\n\n[[Philip Gidley King]], who was in England in 1799, was aware of the lack of vessels in New South Wales, and lobbied for ''Lady Nelson'' to be taken over for use in the Colony. The cost to the government was said to be \u00a3890.<ref name=KingBanks20Mar1799>Philip Gidley King (King) to [[Sir Joseph Banks]] (Banks), 20 Mar. 1799, ML Banks Papers, Series 39.043.</ref> He personally inspected the vessel on 8 October 1799, whilst it was being fitted-out at Deptford, and suggested that:<blockquote>as few seamen know anything about the management of a cutter, her being constructed into a brig would make her more manageable to the generality of seamen.</blockquote> Schanck agreed with this change and the Commissioners of Transport were directed to rig the vessel as a brig, and not as a cutter like the ''Trial'' as had been intended.<ref>King to John King, Under Secretary of State for the Home Department, 8 Oct 1799, HRNSW, Vol. III, p. 724.

I, Vol. II, pp. 483\u2013484.</ref>\n\nThe ability to raise the keels was a useful feature for a survey vessel required to work in shallow waters. ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s draught was 12 feet when she left England, fully provisioned for her voyage. This would draught would halve to six feet when the keels were raised.<ref name=GrantBanks31Jan1800/>{{efn| As a result of the consumption of provisions, when ''Lady Nelson'' reached Table Bay 'she drew at present not more than five feet aft, and four forwards when the keels were up' <ref>Grant 1803, p. 38.</ref>}} The keels were of timber construction with no added ballast.{{efn| In a dissertation titled ''An Account of the Origin of Sliding Keels and the advantages resulting from their use'' there is a supposition based on a comparison of 'a frigate drawing seventeen feet, and another alike in burthen drawing eleven'. Some writers have interpreted this to mean that the draught of the ''Lady Nelson'' may have been seventeen feet had it not been for her sliding keels. This supposition is based on the knowledge of an author in the eighteenth century and would be open to challenge by hydrodynamicists today.<ref>Grant 1803, pp. v\u2013xxvi.</ref>}}\n\n''Lady Nelson'' was built by John Dudman in the dockyard, known as Deadman's Dock, at Grove Street, [[Deptford]].{{efn| The builder's name is deduced from ''Lady Nelson'' having been fitted-out at Deadman's Dock and that John Dudman was a ship-builder there in 1799.<ref>Lowndes 1799, p. 55.

She may have been built in a dry dock, in which case she would not, strictly speaking, have been launched, but floated by filling the dock.}} ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s first commander was Lieutenant [[James Grant (navigator)|James Grant]], the commission of whom came into effect on 19 October 1799.<ref>Grant to King, 17 Feb. 1801, HRA, Ser.

I, Vol. II, pp. 498\u2013501.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nPhilip Gidley King departed for New South Wales in ''Speedy'' on 26 Nov 1799 with a despatch recalling the incumbent Governor, John Hunter, who returned to England. King then took over as Governor and subsequently played a key part in the affairs of ''Lady Nelson'' after she arrived.\n\n==The voyage to Australia==\n''Lady Nelson'' was loaded with sufficient provisions for nine months and enough water for six months, at an allowance of one gallon for each man per day. She was not equipped with a chronometer.{{efn|Chronometers were expensive and few vessels were equipped with them in the early 19th Century.}}<ref name=GrantBanks31Jan1800/>\n\nThe beginning of the voyage to Australia was recorded by Grant: <blockquote>On 13 January 1800, the ''Lady Nelson'' hauled out of Deadman's Dock into the River, having her complement of men, stores, and provisions on board.{{efn|The source of, and the quotations in the parts of this article covering the period of the command of Lieutenant James Grant is Grant 1803, except where cited otherwise.}}</blockquote> ''Lady Nelson'' reached Gravesend on 16 January, anchored in the Downs on 20 January 1800. After riding out a heavy gale Grant decided to seek shelter in Ramsgate Harbour. ''Lady Nelson'' remained there until 7 February, when she sailed for Portsmouth to await a convoy to escort her past the French and Spanish coasts.{{efn| A state of war existed between Britain, France, the Batavian Republic, and Spain, and sailing in convoy was therefore essential.}}\n\nWhilst at Portsmouth ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s armament, consisting of two brass carriage guns, was increased to six. On 15 March 1800, Captain Schanck, accompanied by Mr. Bayley, of the Royal Academy, Portsmouth, paid Grant a visit.{{efn|William Bayly was an assistant astronomer at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich and was sent on Cook's voyages of discovery in, 1772 and 1776. He was head master of the Royal Academy at Portsmouth from 1785 to 1807.}}\n\nMany people who saw ''Lady Nelson'' did not consider her suitable to undertake such a long voyage and this caused Grant some difficulty in keeping his crew together and finding replacements for those that deserted. The carpenter, who had deserted when leaving Portsmouth, and one other member of the crew were not replaced and one man was put ashore due to illness. When ''Lady Nelson'' sailed her complement was probably therefore only three officers and ten crew.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' departed from Dunnose, Isle of Wight, at 6 pm on 18 March.<ref>For the departure date see Steel, Jun. 1800; ''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 3, p. 238; and Grant 1803, p. 4.</ref>{{efn| Prior to 1805 British naval vessels operated under Nautical Time in which a nautical day ran from today's noon to tomorrow's noon, and was given tomorrow's date. All dates quoted in this article are those appearing in the relevant cited document and, to avoid compounding any possible errors in earlier transpositions, no corrections have been made from Nautical to Civil time. Authors have dealt with this in different ways: Grant 1803, is based on ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s logs and the dates are expressed in nautical time; in Lee 1915, the transcriptions are from the original logs and the dates are expressed in nautical time; in Flinders 1814, civil dates are noted in the page margins; in Labilliere 1878, dates have been inserted in parenthesis in the transcription of Murray's log that purport to be civil dates, but they are not reliable. (Labilliere 1878, Vol. I, on p. 86, states that ''Lady Nelson'' entered Port Phillip on 15 February 1802 Civil Time, but the actual time was around mid-day on 14 February Civil Time).}}The convoy consisted of East Indiamen, heading for the East, and {{HMS|Porpoise|1799|6}}, which was also bound for New South Wales.\n\nShortly after departure it became apparent that ''Lady Nelson'' could not keep up with the larger and faster vessels in the convoy. ''Brunswick'' therefore took ''Lady Nelson'' in tow, but Grant became concerned that the vessel might be strained too much in the heavy seas and therefore, after a couple of days, ordered the hawser to be cast off, preferring to continue the voyage alone.\n\nOn 13 April ''Lady Nelson'' anchored at Port Praya ([[Praia]]), on the island of 'St Jago' ([[Santiago, Cape Verde|Ilha de Santiago]]), the largest of the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, 26 days after leaving Portsmouth. Whilst there, the keels were inspected and it was found that part of the after keel had broken off, which may have occurred during earlier heavy weather. The missing part of the keel was replaced, a task not made any easier by the lack of a carpenter on board. Before leaving, Grant put his second mate ashore for sowing seeds of discontent amongst the crew, and obtained the Governor's permission to take two young men from the island to supplement his crew. ''Lady Nelson'' left Praia on 27 April. The vessel's complement was now three officers and twelve crew.\n\nOn 23 May, the weather being fine, ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s keels were examined and it was found that the piece that had been fitted to the bottom of the after keel at Praia had broken off.{{efn|The casings for the sliding keels extended above the deck and whilst at sea the vessel's boats were stowed over the top of the casings. Calm weather was required to move a boat to remove a keel for inspection.<ref>Grant 1803, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>}} A temporary repair was effected by pushing the keel deeper into the well, and securing it with a plank of wood.\n\nLand was sighted near [[Table Bay]] at 5 am on 7 June and ''Lady Nelson'' anchored there at 5 pm on 8 June 1800. A shipbuilder from the naval dockyard examined ''Lady Nelson'' and as her main and after keels were both found to be beyond repair they were replaced with new ones. ''Lady Nelson'' had been troubled by leaks in her topsides since she left England. This was also investigated whilst the vessel was at the Cape, and it was found 'that instead of the seams being filled with oakum they had absolutely substituted putty'.<ref>Memorial of Lieut. James Grant, commanding H. M. brig Lady Nelson, to His Excellency Governor King, Sydney Cove, Tuesday, 16 December 1800, HRNSW, Vol. IV, pp. 268\u2013270 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>\n\nTwo new keels having been fitted, ''Lady Nelson'' left Table Bay on 16 June and anchored in [[Simon's Bay]] the next day. Already anchored there was ''Porpoise'', which had left Portsmouth in the same convoy as ''Lady Nelson''.\n\nGrant's orders were 'to remain at the Cape till the summer season commenced' so as not to risk his small vessel in the [[Roaring Forties]] during the southern hemisphere winter. Grant therefore spent many weeks at the Cape and the observations he made during the period are recorded in his book (Grant 1803).\n\nWhilst at the Cape, Grant received a despatch from London in which he was advised that a navigable strait had recently been discovered between New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), in latitude 38\u00b0 south, and the despatch instructed him to: <blockquote>sail through the said strait on your way to Port Jackson, by which means you will not only shorten your voyage, but will have an opportunity of more minutely surveying the said strait.{{efn|The existence of a strait separating Van Diemen{{'}}s Land from the Australian mainland was conclusively established by [[George Bass|Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders|Flinders]] in ''Norfolk'' in 1798 and was subsequently named [[Bass Strait|Bass('s) Strait]].<ref>Flinders 1814, Vol. I, pp. cxxxviii\u2013cxciii.</ref>}} <ref>Portland to Grant, 8 Apr. 1800, TNA CO 202/5, AJCP PRO 56 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. II, p. 501.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nBefore leaving the Cape, Grant took on board a carpenter and a person named Dr. Brandt. Grant also consented to take on board a Danish seaman, sentenced at the Cape to transportation, for his involvement in mutinous behaviour on board a recently arrived ship. ''Lady Nelson'' left the Cape on 7 October 1800.\n\n==The first passage through Bass Strait==\nThe south coast of what was then called New Holland was not sighted until ''Lady Nelson'' approached the land near the present border between South Australia and Victoria.{{efn|The instructions given to the first governor of New South Wales, Captain Arthur Phillip R.N., appointing him Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of the new colony, defined the territory as extending from Cape York in the north to South Cape in the south and extending only as far west as 135\u00b0 east longitude. The remainder of the continent continued to be known as New Holland.<ref>HRNSW, Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 85\u201391 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. I, pp. 9\u201316.</ref> The name ''Australia'' did not come into use until after 1820.}}\n\nGrant recorded first sighting the mainland on 3 December 1800:<blockquote>At 8.00 am I saw the land from the north training as far to the east as east-north-east. The part that was right ahead appearing like unconnected islands, being four in number, distant six or seven [[League (unit)|leagues]]. At noon I observed, being in with the land, our latitude to be 38\u00b0 10' S. longitude, by account, 142\u00b0 30' E. which according to my best judgement, after looking over my reckoning, I allowed the western point of land [[Cape Banks]] to lay in 142\u00b0 E. From the distance I was from the shore, and observing in 38\u00b0 10', I make Cape Banks to lie in 38\u00b0 4' S.</blockquote>\n\nGrant observed two capes and two high mountains a considerable way inshore. Grant named the first of these mountains after Captain Schanck (since renamed [[Mount Schank]]), and the other [[Mount Gambier (volcano)|Gambier's Mountain]]. The western cape he called Cape Banks and the second, eastern cape, he called [[Cape Northumberland]]. The actual position of Cape Banks is longitude {{coord|140|23|E|37|54|S}}. The discrepancy in longitude would have resulted, at least in part, by the absence of a chronometer on ''Lady Nelson''.{{efn|Although Bass and Flinders had sailed through Bass Strait during their voyage of discovery, ''Lady Nelson'' was the first vessel to sail through it on a voyage to the east coast of Australia.

He named another cape, eight or ten nautical miles East-North-East-half East, Patton's Cape (now Cape Patton).{{efn|In this article, all miles are nautical miles of 2,040 yards or 1,865 metres}} A large bay, now appearing to the east, he named [[Portland Bay]].{{efn| The name Portland Bay survives as only that part of the coast between Portland and [[Lady Julia Percy Island]] and not from Cape Nelson to Cape Otway.}}\n\nOn 8 December ''Lady Nelson'' sailed across a large bay, which was found to extend from Cape Otway in the west to [[Wilsons Promontory]] in the east, a distance of 120 nautical miles. Grant named this large extent of water Governor King's Bay, but the name has not survived. The discovery of [[Port Phillip]], at the head of this bay, the bottom of which could not be seen from the mast-head, was still many months into the future.\n\nAs the coast between [[Wilsons Promontory]] and Port Jackson had already examined by [[George Bass|Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders|Flinders]], Grant did not conduct any further surveys and headed for Port Jackson, anchoring in Sydney Cove at 7.30 pm on 16 December 1800 after a voyage of 71 days from the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nThe agreements entered into between the Transport Board and the crew of ''Lady Nelson'' terminated on arrival of the vessel in Port Jackson and accordingly the crew were paid off.<ref>King to Grant, 27 Dec. 1800, HRNSW, Vol. IV, p. 275.</ref> King had not received any directions on whether the vessel was to be considered on the establishment of the Navy, the Transport Board, or the Colony, and it was many months before this administrative matter was resolved.{{efn| King wrote three letters on this subject.\n*To the Transport Commissioners who replied 'our concern with her terminates with her arrival at Port Jackson'.<ref>King to the Transport Commissioners, 10 Mar. 1801, HRA, Ser.

''Lady Nelson'' had arrived off the island that forms the south head of Western Port and from its likeness to a snapper's head, Grant named it Snapper Island, since renamed [[Phillip Island]].{{efn|Western Port was first surveyed by George Bass who had sailed from Port Jackson in a whale-boat and discovered, entered, and named the port in January 1798.<ref>Flinders 1814, Vol. I, p. cxiii.</ref>}}\n\nThe greater part of the survey of Western Port was completed by 22 April but bad weather prevented ''Lady Nelson'' from leaving until 29 April. Grant noted:<blockquote> Western Port is capable of containing several hundred sail of ships with perfect security from storms, and will admit of being fortified.</blockquote> ''Lady Nelson'' then headed east with the intention of surveying the coast between Western Port and Wilsons Promontory but the weather prevented them from remaining constantly near the coast and Grant therefore decided to return to Port Jackson. Further bad weather was encountered and, after sheltering in Botany Bay for 24 hours, ''Lady Nelson'' arrived back at Port Jackson on 14 May 1801. Grant later wrote: <blockquote> the unfavourableness of the weather prevented me from completing the whole of my instructions ... It is true that the winter season of that climate was fast approaching; and instead of exploring to the southward we ought to have gone to the northward, by which means we should avoid many tempestuous gales.</blockquote>\n\nAfter a brief stay in Port Jackson ''Lady Nelson'' was sent to explore and survey the Coal River to the north of Port Jackson.

Land was sighted on 19 November that turned out to be Flinders Island, in the Furneaux Group, off the north-west tip of Tasmania, and not the Kent Group as intended. ''Lady Nelson'' anchored between Store House and Cat Islands in the Babel group of islands, off the east coast of Flinders Island, and remained there until 24 November.\n\nFrom the Furneaux Group, ''Lady Nelson'' headed for the Kent Group and anchored in West Cove on the eastern side of Erith Island. ''Lady Nelson'' remained in West Cove until 4 December during which time the channel, now known as Murray Pass, was comprehensively surveyed using her boats.\n\nFrom the Kent Group ''Lady Nelson'' headed north-west, passing Wilson's Promontory and Cape Liptrap and anchoring in Western Port on 7 December. Bad weather detained ''Lady Nelson'' in Western Port for several days, during which time she had to re-anchor several times.\n\nA light easterly wind enabled ''Lady Nelson'' to leave the anchorage in Western Port on 4 January. After stopping in Elizabeth{{'}}s Cove to replenish water casks, she followed the coast to the west. The next day: <blockquote>at 3 p.m. we saw a headland bearing west-north-west, distant about 12 miles and an opening in the land that had the appearance of a harbour north-west 10 or 12 miles.</blockquote> ''Lady Nelson'' sailed to within 1{{frac|1|2}} miles of the entrance and from the masthead Murray observed: <blockquote>a sheet of smooth water .... and is apparently a fine harbour of large extent.</blockquote> Murray did not attempt to approach any closer to the harbour because of a fresh on-shore wind.\n\nNot being able to enter, the as yet unnamed Port Phillip, Murray continued west towards Cape Otway but was unable to make any further progress westwards due to a south-westerly gale and headed for calmer waters to the eastern side of King Island. ''Lady Nelson'' remained in the vicinity of King Island until 24 January during which time all except the west coast had been surveyed. As Murray 'took leave of this large and fine island', he noted:<blockquote>I much lament not having as yet had it in my power from the series of unfavourable weather we have met with so exactly to comply with the Commander-in-Chief's orders as I could wished.</blockquote> ''Lady Nelson'' left King Island on 24 January, and headed north intending to run to Cape Otway. However the weather intervened, Murray noting: 'I shall only observe that I never experienced such a length of bad weather at any time of the year, or in any country since I sailed the seas.' On sighting the land on 30 January Murray 'perceived with surprise that it was Cape Shanks [Cape Schanck] and Grant's Point instead of Cape Albany'. (''Lady Nelson'' had been blown several miles to the east.)\n\n''Lady Nelson'' therefore returned to Western Port and anchored there on 31 January 1802. Murray 'sent the launch with Mr. Bowen and five men, armed with 14 days provisions and water', to the westward to examine the entrance discovered earlier in the voyage (5 January 1802). Bowen returned on 4 February and reported that a good channel had been found into this new harbour that was larger than Western Port. ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s launch was therefore the first European vessel to enter Port Phillip.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' was unable to leave Western Port to examine the new harbour for several days due to light winds, Murray noting in his log on 13 February 1802:<blockquote>it fell calm and our hopes of getting to sea this day vanished, it is almost needless to observe that this kind of weather is as destructive to the intent of this cruise as gales at sea.</blockquote>\n\nA favourable wind enabled ''Lady Nelson'' to leave Western Port at 5 a.m. on 14 February. 'By noon the Island in the entrance of this harbour bore north half a mile distant' and the newly found harbour was entered, 'with all sail set', shortly after mid-day.{{efn|''Lady Nelson'' entered the port on Sunday 14 February Civil Time but the first description of the harbour is entered in the log on 15 February, a new Nautical Day having commenced at mid-day.}} Murray named the new harbour Port King, but Governor King later renamed it Port Phillip after the first Governor, Captain Arthur Phillip.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' remained in Port Phillip for 25 days and on 8 March 1802 Murray proceeded: <blockquote>to take possession of this Port in the form and manner laid down ... , and accordingly at 8 o'clock in the morning the United Colours of the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland were hoisted on board and on Point Patterson, and at one o'clock under a discharge of three volleys of small arms and artillery the Port was taken possession of in the name of his Sacred Majesty George the Third of Great Britain and Ireland, King, etc., etc.</blockquote> The city of Melbourne was eventually to grow on the north shore of this port.{{efn|For a full transcript of the proceedings in Port Phillip, from 16 Feb. to 11 Mar 1802, see Labilliere 1878.

Both vessels anchored there on 29 September and Flinders named them Percy Isles.\n\nBoth vessels left the Percy Isles on 4 October and Flinders spent several days looking for a passage through the reef, anchoring several times in the process. ''Investigator'' lost an anchor and ''Lady Nelson'' lost one and broke one arm off another. Flinders decided not to attempt any more narrow passages through the reef and resumed the voyage towards Torres Strait and the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. Flinders provided ''Lady Nelson'' with two grapnels, which was all that ''Investigator'' could spare.<ref>Flinders 1814, Vol. II, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nOn 17 October Murray noted: <blockquote>I have now had several opportunities of seeing that from the want of our main and after keels we are so leewardly that the ''Investigator'' in 6 hours will get with ease 4 miles to windward of the brig.</blockquote>\n\nOn the same day Flinders decided to send ''Lady Nelson'' back to Port Jackson. She was sailing so poorly since losing her keels, that she not only delayed ''Investigator'', but ran great risk of herself being lost. Furthermore, instead of saving the crew of ''Investigator'', in case of accident, which was one of the main reasons for having a tender, it was likely ''Investigator'' might be called upon to save ''Lady Nelson''. Flinders saw ''Lady Nelson'', after her loss of anchors and cables, replacements for which ''Investigator'' could not spare without endangering her own safety, becoming a burden rather than an assistance.<ref>Flinders 1814, Vol. II, p. 96.</ref>\n\nMurray received orders from Flinders 'to proceed to Port Jackson with the Lady Nelson as fast as circumstances would allow', and a letter to deliver to Governor King.<ref>Flinders to King, His Majesty's Sloop Investigator, Off Cumberland Isles, 18 October 1802, HRNSW, Vol. IV, pp. 857\u2013860 and HRA, Ser.

By 10.40 am, on 18 October, ''Investigator{{'}}''s topsails could just be seen from ''Lady Nelson'', disappearing over the horizon. This was the end of ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s voyages of discovery.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' headed south, anchoring occasionally with the broken anchor, but, when pausing at Cape Townshend on 28 October, this anchor was lost. The remaining anchor was let go, but, in the process, ''Lady Nelson'' drifted away from the intended anchorage. With only one remaining anchor, and only one small boat, ''Lady Nelson'' was in a precarious situation.\n\nAs it was essential to move to a safer anchorage, Murray improvised an anchor by lashing two swivel guns together, which enabled ''Lady Nelson'' to sail into a more sheltered anchorage in Shoalwater Bay. The carpenter then went ashore in the boat to find an iron-bark tree with which to make a replacement anchor.\n\nThe remainder of the voyage to Port Jackson was uneventful and ''Lady Nelson'' anchored in Sydney Cove at 10.40 am on 22 November 1802.\n\nBefore her next significant voyage, ''Lady Nelson'' made another trip to Norfolk Island to convey troops to relieve the garrison there. This was probably ''Lady Nelson''{{'s}} last voyage under Murray. ''Lady Nelsons''{{'}}s next commander was George Curtoys, (sometimes spelt Courtoys but spelt Curtoys in the commander's own log), previously the master's mate of {{HMS|Glatton|1795|6}}, which had arrived from England in March 1803.<ref>King to Nepean, 12 Apr. 1803, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. IV, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\n==The Settlement of the Derwent==\n''Lady Nelson'' was one of the vessels selected to establish the first settlement in Tasmania. The desire to settle that part of Australia arose from King's concern that [[Nicolas Baudin|Baudin]], leader of the French expedition in [[French corvette Naturaliste|''La Naturaliste'']], intended to establish a settlement on the east side of Van Diemen's Land.<ref>King to Hobart, 9 Nov. 1802, TNA CO 201/22, AJCP PRO 11 and HRA, Ser.

Matthew Flinders and George Bass had previously visited the site during their circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land.\n\nAn initial expedition to establish British sovereignty over Van Diemen's Land was made by Acting-Lieutenant [[Charles Robbins (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Robbins]], who left Port Jackson in {{HMS|Cumberland|1803|6}} on 23 November 1802.{{efn| ''Cumberland'' was a schooner of 26 tons (bm), built in Port Jackson in 1801.}}\n\nLieutenant [[John Bowen (colonist)|John Bowen]], an officer in the recently arrived ''Glatton'', was chosen as Commandant and Superintendent of the new settlement and was instructed to proceed with ''Lady Nelson'' and ''Porpoise'', and with the men, women, stores, and provisions necessary for forming the intended settlement.<ref>King's Instructions to Lieutenant Bowen, 28 Mar. 1803, HRA, Ser.

The adverse winds continued for several days, driving her back to the north; on 21 June heavy seas resulted in the loss of the ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s boat. The safety of Twofold Bay was not reached until 24 June by which time all ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s supply of bread had been consumed and only three casks of water remained. A raft was constructed from her spars in order to get ashore to replenish their supply of fresh water and the ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s carpenter was sent to cut timber with which to build a punt to replace the lost boat. ''Lady Nelson'' left Twofold Bay on 1 July to continue her voyage, but soon afterwards part of the main keel was seen drifting away astern. At this point the voyage was aborted and ''Lady Nelson'' returned to Port Jackson.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' arrived back in Port Jackson on 5 July and found that ''Porpoise'' had also turned back and had arrived two days earlier.<ref>''Gazette'', 17 Jul. 1803.</ref>\n\n''Lady Nelson'' departed again on 21 August 1803 but, two days out, her main mast was found to be sprung (damaged). Once again she had to return.<ref>Gazette, 28 Aug. 1803.</ref>\n\n''Lady Nelson'' was repaired and set off again on 29 August 1803, this time accompanied by the whaler ''Albion''. ''Lady Nelson'' had a reasonably uneventful voyage and anchored in Risden Cove on the River Derwent on 9 September 1803. ''Albion'' arrived two days later. The next several days were employed in landing stores and establishing the settlers on shore. Both vessels had departed before the end of September leaving the settlement, comprising 49 souls, with no means of communication with the outside world.\n\n== Evacuation of the Settlement at Port Phillip ==\nIn October 1803 two ships, ''[[Ocean (1794 ship)|Ocean]]'' and {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|2}}, arrived in [[Port Phillip]], from England, with the intention of establishing a settlement. Lieutenant-Colonel [[David Collins (governor)|David Collins]] was to be Lieutenant-Governor of the new settlement.<ref>Hobart to Collins, 7 Feb.1803, TNA CO 202/6, AJCP PRO 56 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. IV, pp. 10\u201316.</ref> The venture was unsuccessful and a decision was taken to abandon the settlement and move its people to Van Diemen's Land. Two locations were considered: either the existing settlement on the Derwent, or a new settlement at Port Dalrymple.<ref>HRA, Ser. III, Vol. I, pp. xv\u2013xx.</ref>\n\nAs the only vessels available, ''Lady Nelson'' and ''Francis'', could not have carried out the task in a reasonable time, King hired the transport ''Ocean'' and the whaler ''Edwin'' to assist them. The 'fleet' therefore comprised four vessels.\n\nGeorge Curtoys, who had been ill for some time, had to relinquish command of ''Lady Nelson'' in November 1803, and returned to England in {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}}.<ref>King to Nepean, 1 Mar. 1804, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. IV, pp. 556\u2013557.</ref> He was replaced by James Symons, previously ''Calcutta''{{'}}s Mate, who took command for the voyage to Port Phillip.{{efn| Symons seems to have remained in command of ''Lady Nelson'' on his Mate's pay until 1 October 1804 when King issued a warrant appointing him Acting-Lieutenant in command of the vessel which entitled him to a lieutenant's pay. King subsequently wrote to the Admiralty seeking their approval.<ref>Warrant of Appointment to Mr. James Symons, 1 Oct. 1804, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. V, p. 238. King to Nepean, 20 Dec. 1804, HRA, Ser.

On board was the naturalist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]], one of the scientific people who came from England on ''Investigator''.{{efn|The source of the part of this article covering the evacuation of the settlement at Port Phillip is Lee 1915, except where cited otherwise.}}\n\nRough weather was experienced on arriving in Bass Strait, and after beating a fortnight against a south-westerly wind, ''Lady Nelson'' took refuge in the Kent Group. Twice ''Lady Nelson'' left the anchorage there to try to reach the destination, and twice she had to return.<ref>Robert Brown to Banks, at anchor, Kent's Group, Bass's Strait, 30 Dec. 1803, The British Library, MS 32439 folio 144 and AJCP M1139.</ref>\n\n''Ocean'' arrived at Port Phillip on 12 December 1803 and ''Francis'' the next day. The master of ''Francis'' reported to Colonel Collins having seen smoke rising from one of the islands in the Kent Group. This raised concerns over the safety of ''Lady Nelson'', which had not yet arrived at Port Phillip.\n\nColonel Collins sent William Collins, in ''Francis'', to assess the suitability of Port Dalrymple as a place to re-settle the people from Port Phillip.{{efn|William Collins was a former naval officer who had arrived on ''Ocean'' as a settler.}} The master of ''Francis'' was requested to sail via the Kent Group to look for ''Lady Nelson''.\n\nWilliam Collins found ''Lady Nelson'' in the Kent Group but by this time ''Francis'' herself was in a very leaky condition and was sent back to Port Jackson. William Collins continued to Port Dalrymple in ''Lady Nelson'', arriving there on 1 January 1804 and remaining until 18 January 1804. William Collins arrived back in Port Phillip, aboard ''Lady Nelson'' on 21 January 1804, with a favourable report on Port Dalrymple, but Colonel Collins had already decided to move to the Derwent.<ref>Collins to King, 27 Jan. 1804, HRA, Ser.

The next day the fore keel was found to have been broken-off and Symons decided to head into Twofold Bay for shelter and to carry out repairs to the vessel.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' anchored on the southern shore of Twofold Bay on 25 October and the crew again had to improvise a raft from the vessel's spars to get ashore. ''Lady Nelson'' got under way again on 3 November; attempts to leave on 1 and 2 November were both aborted due to the weather. She encountered the sloop ''George'', which was bound for the Derwent from Port Jackson, shortly after leaving Twofold Bay and its master gave a boat's compass to Symons to replace those lost in the storm.{{efn|''George'' was a sloop of 28 tons (bm), privately built on the Hawkesbury River.}}\n\nThe bad weather continued:\n*on 5 November 'the main top-sail blown out of the [[bolt rope]] and was lost',\n*on 6 November 'at 4 pm took in all sail'; and\n*on 7 November 'Strong gales and bad sea. At 8 blew the fore stay-sail totally away and split the main stay-sail.'\n\n''Lady Nelson'' headed down the western side of Flinders Island, sighted Cape Barren on 9 November, 'beat in through the narrows' and on 10 November reached Kent's Bay, on the south side of Cape Barren Island, where the schooner ''Francis'' was found at anchor, also sheltering from the weather. ''Lady Nelson'' remained in Kent's Bay, repairing storm damage, until 13 November when both vessels got under way. The next day ''Lady Nelson'' sought shelter at Waterhouse Island and remained there until 20 November when the weather improved.\n\n''Lady Nelson'', with ''Francis'' in company, finally reached Port Dalrymple on 21 November 1804. ''Buffalo'', a larger vessel, had arrived on 4 November 1804, and ''Integrity'' had arrived the next day.\n\nAfter she had unloaded her cargo, ''Lady Nelson'' was employed in surveying and erecting beacons in the harbour to facilitate the safe entry of ships into the new port.\n\n''Buffalo'' and ''Integrity'' departed on 27 November, and ''Francis'' on 29 December 1804. ''Lady Nelson'', the last of the small squadron to leave, departed on 11 January 1805. The settlement was initially located at Outer Cove on the east side of the River Tamar but soon relocated to York Cove on the west side of the river. Eventually the settlement was moved further up the river to a spot near the confluence of the North and South Esk rivers that Paterson named [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]]. ''Lady Nelson'' arrived back in Port Jackson on 23 January 1805.\n\n==Capture of ''Extreme\u00f1a''==\nIn April 1805 King received information that suggested that a Spanish armed schooner was anchored in [[Jervis Bay]], 90 miles to the south of Sydney. King sent ''Lady Nelson'', under the command of Acting-Lieutenant Symons, to look for the Spanish vessel and, if found, bring her to Port Jackson.\n\nThe Spanish vessel was [[Estremina|''Extreme\u00f1a'']], an armed merchant vessel owned by merchants in Madras had seized on the coast of Chile. Britain and Spain were not at war at the time of the seizure, which was therefore illegal. On sighting ''Lady Nelson'', ''Extreme\u00f1a'' tried to escape but Symons fired a shot across her bows, arrested her, and escorted her back to Port Jackson.\n\n==Later Service==\n''Lady Nelson'' continued to be employed in carrying passengers and supplies between Port Jackson and the other settlements along the coast of New South Wales and Tasmania for many years. Some of these voyages were recorded in the newspapers of the time.

In December 1824, Barlow sent ''Lady Nelson'' and George Miller, who was responsible for maintaining a supply of provisions, to the Dutch settlement at Kupang on the island of Timor for supplies.

The existing upper masts, spars and rigging were retained.\n\nThe rebuilt replica was transported from Warrnambool to Mount Gambier by road and mounted on a concrete slab; it now forms a tourist attraction at the Discovery Centre.{{efn|The story of the Mount Gambier Replica is based on information on the websites of the Lady Nelson Visitor & Discovery Centre and the Maritime Village Boatyard.}}\n\n===Tasmanian Sail Training Association Replica (1988)===\n[[File:Lady Nelson, Hobart, 2019 (02).jpg|thumb|Replica of the ''Lady Nelson'' in Hobart]]\n[[File:Lady Nelson 03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Replica of the ''Lady Nelson'' in Hobart]]\nThe Tasmanian Sail Training Association was established to build and sail a replica of the ''Lady Nelson'' as part of the celebrations to mark the 200th anniversary of the European settlement of Australia in January 1788. She was built at a cost of more than $700,000 largely funded by Tasmanian taxpayers via the State Government, with assistance from local and corporate sponsors. <ref>Cusick 2007. </ref>\n\nRay Kemp built the replica at Woodbridge near Hobart in Tasmania. He built it largely from Tasmanian-grown timbers: blue gum keel and frames, celery-top pine deck, and Douglas fir lower masts. The spars are American-grown Oregon. \n\nKemp launched ''Lady Nelson'' on 29 November 1987. A commissioning ceremony was held on 17 December 1988 and the replica went on its first cruise, on the River Derwent, in March 1989.\n\nFrom July 1990 to early 1996 the replica ''Lady Nelson'' went on several voyages during the cold Tasmanian winter, across Bass Strait to Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland.The vessel also followed the fleets of the Melbourne to Hobart yacht race in 1993 and 1994.

At the time large parts of the Australian coast were unmapped and Britain had claimed only part of the continent. The British Government were concerned that, in the event of settlers of another European power becoming established in Australia, any future conflict in Europe would lead to a widening of the conflict into the southern hemisphere to the detriment of the trade that Britain sought to develop. It was against this background that ''Lady Nelson'' was chosen to survey and establish sovereignty over strategic parts of the continent.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' left [[Portsmouth]] on 18 March 1800 and arrived at [[Sydney]] on 16 December 1800 after having been the first vessel to reach the east coast of Australia via [[Bass Strait]]. Prior to that date all vessels had sailed around the southern tip of [[Tasmania]] to reach their destination.\n\n''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s survey work commenced shortly after her arrival at Sydney, initially in the Bass Strait area. She was involved in the discovery of [[Port Phillip]], on the coast of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in establishing settlements on the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]] and at [[Port Dalrymple]] in Tasmania, at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Port Macquarie]] in New South Wales, and on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] off the north coast of the continent.\n\n== Design, building and commissioning ==\nAt the end of the 1790s the New South Wales Colonial Government had no vessels capable of reaching the outside world. ''Supply'' (1793) was found to be unseaworthy in 1797 and was subsequently condemned. {{HMS|Reliance|1793|2}} was also unseaworthy. ''Reliance'' was temporarily repaired to enable her to sail back to England, whither she departed in March 1800. The only other vessel under the control of the colonial government was {{ship||Francis|1793|2}}, a [[schooner]] of only 44 tons (bm). The situation was partially relieved when {{HMS|Buffalo|1797|2}} arrived in May 1799, but the colony possessed no vessels for exploration and surveying.{{efn|''Buffalo'' was a ship of 468 tons (bm). She arrived in Port Jackson on 3 May 1799 with 60 head of cattle on board that she had loaded at the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. ''Buffalo'' returned to the Cape for live cattle again, departing on 13 September 1799, and arriving back in Port Jackson on 16 April 1800. When Governor John Hunter's term of office ended, he elected to take ''Buffalo'' back to England; she departed on 28 September 1800. Following protestations by Philip Gidley King after he became governor, ''Buffalo'' returned to Port Jackson in October 1802.}}\n\nIn 1799 the Admiralty's Commissioners of Transport (the [[Transport Board (Royal Navy)|Transport Board]]), ordered a [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] of 60 tons (bm), to be built for their own use in the River Thames and called it ''Lady Nelson''. Her design followed that of the armed cutter ''Trial'', built in Plymouth in 1789 to a design developed by Captain (later Admiral) [[John Schank|John Schanck]] [often spelled Schank].{{sfnp|Winfield|2008|p=337}} ''Trial'' was unusual in that she had three sliding keels, or centre-boards, that the crew could raise or lower individually.\n\nAt the time there were several other vessels named ''Lady Nelson'' and this has led some authors to write that the vessel, which is the subject of this article, was employed on other duties before being sent to Australia.{{efn|See for example:\n*''The Times'', 20 Nov. 1798, cites a ''Lady Nelson'' with five sliding keels being launched on Tuesday 20 November 1798. This vessel was 'so contrived, that by turning a screw, a stem is formed on her stern, and she will sail the other way without the inconvenience of tacking about';\n*The ''Sun'', 27 Jul. 1799, cited a ''Lady Nelson'', Captain Tate, arrived at Liverpool on 25 July 1799 from Jamaica;\n*''Oracle and Daily Advertiser'' (17 Sep. 1799) reported 'Yesterday [13 Sep. 1799] sailed the ''Lady Nelson'' cutter, on a cruize';\n*''Naval Chronicle'' (Vol. 3, Jan. to Jul. 1800, p. 307.), cites an English cutter ''Lady Nelson'', being taken by French privateers on 21 December 1799 but freed by the actions of Lieutenant Bainbridge of ''Queen Charlotte'';\n*Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p. 238, cites ''Lady Nelson'', Captain Barrow, an ordnance store ship, [departing] 'for Gibraltar' 17 March 1800 in the Portsmouth Report;\n*The ''Naval Chronicle'' (Vol. 3, p. 326), cites from the Plymouth Report 27 March 1800: 'Came in the ''Lady Nelson'', with fruit, captured by a French privateer, and recaptured by the Childers, 16 guns, Captain Crawford';\n*The ''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 4, Jul. to Dec. 1800, p. 245, cites a cutter named ''Lady Nelson'' now [no precise date] being on the Lisbon, Gibraltar, and Mediterranean Stations.}}\n\n[[Philip Gidley King]], who was in England in 1799, was aware of the lack of vessels in New South Wales, and lobbied for ''Lady Nelson'' to be taken over for use in the Colony. The cost to the government was said to be \u00a3890.<ref name=KingBanks20Mar1799>Philip Gidley King (King) to [[Sir Joseph Banks]] (Banks), 20 Mar. 1799, ML Banks Papers, Series 39.043.</ref> He personally inspected the vessel on 8 October 1799, whilst it was being fitted-out at Deptford, and suggested that:<blockquote>as few seamen know anything about the management of a cutter, her being constructed into a brig would make her more manageable to the generality of seamen.</blockquote> Schanck agreed with this change and the Commissioners of Transport were directed to rig the vessel as a brig, and not as a cutter like the ''Trial'' as had been intended.<ref>King to John King, Under Secretary of State for the Home Department, 8 Oct 1799, HRNSW, Vol. III, p. 724.

''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s draught was 12 feet when she left England, fully provisioned for her voyage. This would draught would halve to six feet when the keels were raised.<ref name=GrantBanks31Jan1800/>{{efn| As a result of the consumption of provisions, when ''Lady Nelson'' reached Table Bay 'she drew at present not more than five feet aft, and four forwards when the keels were up' <ref>Grant 1803, p. 38.</ref>}} The keels were of timber construction with no added ballast.{{efn| In a dissertation titled ''An Account of the Origin of Sliding Keels and the advantages resulting from their use'' there is a supposition based on a comparison of 'a frigate drawing seventeen feet, and another alike in burthen drawing eleven'. Some writers have interpreted this to mean that the draught of the ''Lady Nelson'' may have been seventeen feet had it not been for her sliding keels. This supposition is based on the knowledge of an author in the eighteenth century and would be open to challenge by hydrodynamicists today.<ref>Grant 1803, pp. v\u2013xxvi.</ref>}}\n\n''Lady Nelson'' was built by John Dudman in the dockyard, known as Deadman's Dock, at Grove Street, [[Deptford]].{{efn| The builder's name is deduced from ''Lady Nelson'' having been fitted-out at Deadman's Dock and that John Dudman was a ship-builder there in 1799.<ref>Lowndes 1799, p. 55.

King then took over as Governor and subsequently played a key part in the affairs of ''Lady Nelson'' after she arrived.\n\n==The voyage to Australia==\n''Lady Nelson'' was loaded with sufficient provisions for nine months and enough water for six months, at an allowance of one gallon for each man per day. She was not equipped with a chronometer.{{efn|Chronometers were expensive and few vessels were equipped with them in the early 19th Century.}}<ref name=GrantBanks31Jan1800/>\n\nThe beginning of the voyage to Australia was recorded by Grant: <blockquote>On 13 January 1800, the ''Lady Nelson'' hauled out of Deadman's Dock into the River, having her complement of men, stores, and provisions on board.{{efn|The source of, and the quotations in the parts of this article covering the period of the command of Lieutenant James Grant is Grant 1803, except where cited otherwise.}}</blockquote> ''Lady Nelson'' reached Gravesend on 16 January, anchored in the Downs on 20 January 1800. After riding out a heavy gale Grant decided to seek shelter in Ramsgate Harbour. ''Lady Nelson'' remained there until 7 February, when she sailed for Portsmouth to await a convoy to escort her past the French and Spanish coasts.{{efn| A state of war existed between Britain, France, the Batavian Republic, and Spain, and sailing in convoy was therefore essential.}}\n\nWhilst at Portsmouth ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s armament, consisting of two brass carriage guns, was increased to six. On 15 March 1800, Captain Schanck, accompanied by Mr. Bayley, of the Royal Academy, Portsmouth, paid Grant a visit.{{efn|William Bayly was an assistant astronomer at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich and was sent on Cook's voyages of discovery in, 1772 and 1776. He was head master of the Royal Academy at Portsmouth from 1785 to 1807.}}\n\nMany people who saw ''Lady Nelson'' did not consider her suitable to undertake such a long voyage and this caused Grant some difficulty in keeping his crew together and finding replacements for those that deserted. The carpenter, who had deserted when leaving Portsmouth, and one other member of the crew were not replaced and one man was put ashore due to illness. When ''Lady Nelson'' sailed her complement was probably therefore only three officers and ten crew.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' departed from Dunnose, Isle of Wight, at 6 pm on 18 March.<ref>For the departure date see Steel, Jun. 1800; ''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 3, p. 238; and Grant 1803, p. 4.</ref>{{efn| Prior to 1805 British naval vessels operated under Nautical Time in which a nautical day ran from today's noon to tomorrow's noon, and was given tomorrow's date. All dates quoted in this article are those appearing in the relevant cited document and, to avoid compounding any possible errors in earlier transpositions, no corrections have been made from Nautical to Civil time. Authors have dealt with this in different ways: Grant 1803, is based on ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s logs and the dates are expressed in nautical time; in Lee 1915, the transcriptions are from the original logs and the dates are expressed in nautical time; in Flinders 1814, civil dates are noted in the page margins; in Labilliere 1878, dates have been inserted in parenthesis in the transcription of Murray's log that purport to be civil dates, but they are not reliable. (Labilliere 1878, Vol. I, on p. 86, states that ''Lady Nelson'' entered Port Phillip on 15 February 1802 Civil Time, but the actual time was around mid-day on 14 February Civil Time).}}The convoy consisted of East Indiamen, heading for the East, and {{HMS|Porpoise|1799|6}}, which was also bound for New South Wales.\n\nShortly after departure it became apparent that ''Lady Nelson'' could not keep up with the larger and faster vessels in the convoy. ''Brunswick'' therefore took ''Lady Nelson'' in tow, but Grant became concerned that the vessel might be strained too much in the heavy seas and therefore, after a couple of days, ordered the hawser to be cast off, preferring to continue the voyage alone.\n\nOn 13 April ''Lady Nelson'' anchored at Port Praya ([[Praia]]), on the island of 'St Jago' ([[Santiago, Cape Verde|Ilha de Santiago]]), the largest of the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, 26 days after leaving Portsmouth. Whilst there, the keels were inspected and it was found that part of the after keel had broken off, which may have occurred during earlier heavy weather. The missing part of the keel was replaced, a task not made any easier by the lack of a carpenter on board. Before leaving, Grant put his second mate ashore for sowing seeds of discontent amongst the crew, and obtained the Governor's permission to take two young men from the island to supplement his crew. ''Lady Nelson'' left Praia on 27 April. The vessel's complement was now three officers and twelve crew.\n\nOn 23 May, the weather being fine, ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s keels were examined and it was found that the piece that had been fitted to the bottom of the after keel at Praia had broken off.{{efn|The casings for the sliding keels extended above the deck and whilst at sea the vessel's boats were stowed over the top of the casings. Calm weather was required to move a boat to remove a keel for inspection.<ref>Grant 1803, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>}} A temporary repair was effected by pushing the keel deeper into the well, and securing it with a plank of wood.\n\nLand was sighted near [[Table Bay]] at 5 am on 7 June and ''Lady Nelson'' anchored there at 5 pm on 8 June 1800. A shipbuilder from the naval dockyard examined ''Lady Nelson'' and as her main and after keels were both found to be beyond repair they were replaced with new ones. ''Lady Nelson'' had been troubled by leaks in her topsides since she left England. This was also investigated whilst the vessel was at the Cape, and it was found 'that instead of the seams being filled with oakum they had absolutely substituted putty'.<ref>Memorial of Lieut. James Grant, commanding H. M. brig Lady Nelson, to His Excellency Governor King, Sydney Cove, Tuesday, 16 December 1800, HRNSW, Vol. IV, pp. 268\u2013270 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>\n\nTwo new keels having been fitted, ''Lady Nelson'' left Table Bay on 16 June and anchored in [[Simon's Bay]] the next day. Already anchored there was ''Porpoise'', which had left Portsmouth in the same convoy as ''Lady Nelson''.\n\nGrant's orders were 'to remain at the Cape till the summer season commenced' so as not to risk his small vessel in the [[Roaring Forties]] during the southern hemisphere winter. Grant therefore spent many weeks at the Cape and the observations he made during the period are recorded in his book (Grant 1803).\n\nWhilst at the Cape, Grant received a despatch from London in which he was advised that a navigable strait had recently been discovered between New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), in latitude 38\u00b0 south, and the despatch instructed him to: <blockquote>sail through the said strait on your way to Port Jackson, by which means you will not only shorten your voyage, but will have an opportunity of more minutely surveying the said strait.{{efn|The existence of a strait separating Van Diemen{{'}}s Land from the Australian mainland was conclusively established by [[George Bass|Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders|Flinders]] in ''Norfolk'' in 1798 and was subsequently named [[Bass Strait|Bass('s) Strait]].<ref>Flinders 1814, Vol. I, pp. cxxxviii\u2013cxciii.</ref>}} <ref>Portland to Grant, 8 Apr. 1800, TNA CO 202/5, AJCP PRO 56 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. II, p. 501.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nBefore leaving the Cape, Grant took on board a carpenter and a person named Dr. Brandt. Grant also consented to take on board a Danish seaman, sentenced at the Cape to transportation, for his involvement in mutinous behaviour on board a recently arrived ship. ''Lady Nelson'' left the Cape on 7 October 1800.\n\n==The first passage through Bass Strait==\nThe south coast of what was then called New Holland was not sighted until ''Lady Nelson'' approached the land near the present border between South Australia and Victoria.{{efn|The instructions given to the first governor of New South Wales, Captain Arthur Phillip R.N., appointing him Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of the new colony, defined the territory as extending from Cape York in the north to South Cape in the south and extending only as far west as 135\u00b0 east longitude.

The part that was right ahead appearing like unconnected islands, being four in number, distant six or seven [[League (unit)|leagues]]. At noon I observed, being in with the land, our latitude to be 38\u00b0 10' S. longitude, by account, 142\u00b0 30' E. which according to my best judgement, after looking over my reckoning, I allowed the western point of land [[Cape Banks]] to lay in 142\u00b0 E. From the distance I was from the shore, and observing in 38\u00b0 10', I make Cape Banks to lie in 38\u00b0 4' S.</blockquote>\n\nGrant observed two capes and two high mountains a considerable way inshore. Grant named the first of these mountains after Captain Schanck (since renamed [[Mount Schank]]), and the other [[Mount Gambier (volcano)|Gambier's Mountain]]. The western cape he called Cape Banks and the second, eastern cape, he called [[Cape Northumberland]]. The actual position of Cape Banks is longitude {{coord|140|23|E|37|54|S}}. The discrepancy in longitude would have resulted, at least in part, by the absence of a chronometer on ''Lady Nelson''.{{efn|Although Bass and Flinders had sailed through Bass Strait during their voyage of discovery, ''Lady Nelson'' was the first vessel to sail through it on a voyage to the east coast of Australia.

He named another cape, eight or ten nautical miles East-North-East-half East, Patton's Cape (now Cape Patton).{{efn|In this article, all miles are nautical miles of 2,040 yards or 1,865 metres}} A large bay, now appearing to the east, he named [[Portland Bay]].{{efn| The name Portland Bay survives as only that part of the coast between Portland and [[Lady Julia Percy Island]] and not from Cape Nelson to Cape Otway.}}\n\nOn 8 December ''Lady Nelson'' sailed across a large bay, which was found to extend from Cape Otway in the west to [[Wilsons Promontory]] in the east, a distance of 120 nautical miles. Grant named this large extent of water Governor King's Bay, but the name has not survived. The discovery of [[Port Phillip]], at the head of this bay, the bottom of which could not be seen from the mast-head, was still many months into the future.\n\nAs the coast between [[Wilsons Promontory]] and Port Jackson had already examined by [[George Bass|Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders|Flinders]], Grant did not conduct any further surveys and headed for Port Jackson, anchoring in Sydney Cove at 7.30 pm on 16 December 1800 after a voyage of 71 days from the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nThe agreements entered into between the Transport Board and the crew of ''Lady Nelson'' terminated on arrival of the vessel in Port Jackson and accordingly the crew were paid off.<ref>King to Grant, 27 Dec. 1800, HRNSW, Vol. IV, p. 275.</ref> King had not received any directions on whether the vessel was to be considered on the establishment of the Navy, the Transport Board, or the Colony, and it was many months before this administrative matter was resolved.{{efn| King wrote three letters on this subject.\n*To the Transport Commissioners who replied 'our concern with her terminates with her arrival at Port Jackson'.<ref>King to the Transport Commissioners, 10 Mar. 1801, HRA, Ser.

''Lady Nelson'' had arrived off the island that forms the south head of Western Port and from its likeness to a snapper's head, Grant named it Snapper Island, since renamed [[Phillip Island]].{{efn|Western Port was first surveyed by George Bass who had sailed from Port Jackson in a whale-boat and discovered, entered, and named the port in January 1798.<ref>Flinders 1814, Vol. I, p. cxiii.</ref>}}\n\nThe greater part of the survey of Western Port was completed by 22 April but bad weather prevented ''Lady Nelson'' from leaving until 29 April. Grant noted:<blockquote> Western Port is capable of containing several hundred sail of ships with perfect security from storms, and will admit of being fortified.</blockquote> ''Lady Nelson'' then headed east with the intention of surveying the coast between Western Port and Wilsons Promontory but the weather prevented them from remaining constantly near the coast and Grant therefore decided to return to Port Jackson. Further bad weather was encountered and, after sheltering in Botany Bay for 24 hours, ''Lady Nelson'' arrived back at Port Jackson on 14 May 1801. Grant later wrote: <blockquote> the unfavourableness of the weather prevented me from completing the whole of my instructions ... It is true that the winter season of that climate was fast approaching; and instead of exploring to the southward we ought to have gone to the northward, by which means we should avoid many tempestuous gales.</blockquote>\n\nAfter a brief stay in Port Jackson ''Lady Nelson'' was sent to explore and survey the Coal River to the north of Port Jackson. The Coal River was later renamed [[Hunter River (New South Wales)|Hunter River]] and is now the site of the City of Newcastle.

Land was sighted on 19 November that turned out to be Flinders Island, in the Furneaux Group, off the north-west tip of Tasmania, and not the Kent Group as intended. ''Lady Nelson'' anchored between Store House and Cat Islands in the Babel group of islands, off the east coast of Flinders Island, and remained there until 24 November.\n\nFrom the Furneaux Group, ''Lady Nelson'' headed for the Kent Group and anchored in West Cove on the eastern side of Erith Island. ''Lady Nelson'' remained in West Cove until 4 December during which time the channel, now known as Murray Pass, was comprehensively surveyed using her boats.\n\nFrom the Kent Group ''Lady Nelson'' headed north-west, passing Wilson's Promontory and Cape Liptrap and anchoring in Western Port on 7 December. Bad weather detained ''Lady Nelson'' in Western Port for several days, during which time she had to re-anchor several times.\n\nA light easterly wind enabled ''Lady Nelson'' to leave the anchorage in Western Port on 4 January. After stopping in Elizabeth{{'}}s Cove to replenish water casks, she followed the coast to the west. The next day: <blockquote>at 3 p.m. we saw a headland bearing west-north-west, distant about 12 miles and an opening in the land that had the appearance of a harbour north-west 10 or 12 miles.</blockquote> ''Lady Nelson'' sailed to within 1{{frac|1|2}} miles of the entrance and from the masthead Murray observed: <blockquote>a sheet of smooth water .... and is apparently a fine harbour of large extent.</blockquote> Murray did not attempt to approach any closer to the harbour because of a fresh on-shore wind.\n\nNot being able to enter, the as yet unnamed Port Phillip, Murray continued west towards Cape Otway but was unable to make any further progress westwards due to a south-westerly gale and headed for calmer waters to the eastern side of King Island. ''Lady Nelson'' remained in the vicinity of King Island until 24 January during which time all except the west coast had been surveyed. As Murray 'took leave of this large and fine island', he noted:<blockquote>I much lament not having as yet had it in my power from the series of unfavourable weather we have met with so exactly to comply with the Commander-in-Chief's orders as I could wished.</blockquote> ''Lady Nelson'' left King Island on 24 January, and headed north intending to run to Cape Otway. However the weather intervened, Murray noting: 'I shall only observe that I never experienced such a length of bad weather at any time of the year, or in any country since I sailed the seas.' On sighting the land on 30 January Murray 'perceived with surprise that it was Cape Shanks [Cape Schanck] and Grant's Point instead of Cape Albany'. (''Lady Nelson'' had been blown several miles to the east.)\n\n''Lady Nelson'' therefore returned to Western Port and anchored there on 31 January 1802. Murray 'sent the launch with Mr. Bowen and five men, armed with 14 days provisions and water', to the westward to examine the entrance discovered earlier in the voyage (5 January 1802). Bowen returned on 4 February and reported that a good channel had been found into this new harbour that was larger than Western Port. ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s launch was therefore the first European vessel to enter Port Phillip.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' was unable to leave Western Port to examine the new harbour for several days due to light winds, Murray noting in his log on 13 February 1802:<blockquote>it fell calm and our hopes of getting to sea this day vanished, it is almost needless to observe that this kind of weather is as destructive to the intent of this cruise as gales at sea.</blockquote>\n\nA favourable wind enabled ''Lady Nelson'' to leave Western Port at 5 a.m. on 14 February. 'By noon the Island in the entrance of this harbour bore north half a mile distant' and the newly found harbour was entered, 'with all sail set', shortly after mid-day.{{efn|''Lady Nelson'' entered the port on Sunday 14 February Civil Time but the first description of the harbour is entered in the log on 15 February, a new Nautical Day having commenced at mid-day.}} Murray named the new harbour Port King, but Governor King later renamed it Port Phillip after the first Governor, Captain Arthur Phillip.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' remained in Port Phillip for 25 days and on 8 March 1802 Murray proceeded: <blockquote>to take possession of this Port in the form and manner laid down ... , and accordingly at 8 o'clock in the morning the United Colours of the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland were hoisted on board and on Point Patterson, and at one o'clock under a discharge of three volleys of small arms and artillery the Port was taken possession of in the name of his Sacred Majesty George the Third of Great Britain and Ireland, King, etc., etc.</blockquote> The city of Melbourne was eventually to grow on the north shore of this port.{{efn|For a full transcript of the proceedings in Port Phillip, from 16 Feb. to 11 Mar 1802, see Labilliere 1878.

Both vessels continued northwards and ''Lady Nelson'' was, on occasion, able to survey parts of the coast where the deeper draught ''Investigator'' could not safely go. At times, Flinders left ''Investigator'' at anchor and boarded ''Lady Nelson'' to continue his survey work. Flinders carried out surveys in [[Keppel Bay]], [[Shoalwater Bay]] and [[Broad Sound (Queensland)|Broad Sound]] and ''Lady Nelson'' was present when Flinders discovered and named [[Gladstone, Queensland|Port Curtis]] and Port Bowen (since renamed [[Port Clinton, Queensland|Port Clinton]]).\n''Lady Nelson'' grounded several times, resulting in damage to her sliding keels, in consequence of which Murray had further difficulty keeping-up with ''Investigator''.{{efn| At Port Bowen the main keel was found to have broken off. It was later replaced by a new one made by ''Investigator{{'}}''s carpenters. In Broad Sound, part of the after keel and part of the new main keel broke off. They were not repaired until ''Lady Nelson'' returned to Port Jackson.}}\n\nAfter leaving Broad Sound Flinders headed for a cluster of islands, to the east of the [[Northumberland Islands|Northumberland Isles]], which he had seen from a hill at Shoalwater Bay. Both vessels anchored there on 29 September and Flinders named them Percy Isles.\n\nBoth vessels left the Percy Isles on 4 October and Flinders spent several days looking for a passage through the reef, anchoring several times in the process. ''Investigator'' lost an anchor and ''Lady Nelson'' lost one and broke one arm off another. Flinders decided not to attempt any more narrow passages through the reef and resumed the voyage towards Torres Strait and the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. Flinders provided ''Lady Nelson'' with two grapnels, which was all that ''Investigator'' could spare.<ref>Flinders 1814, Vol. II, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nOn 17 October Murray noted: <blockquote>I have now had several opportunities of seeing that from the want of our main and after keels we are so leewardly that the ''Investigator'' in 6 hours will get with ease 4 miles to windward of the brig.</blockquote>\n\nOn the same day Flinders decided to send ''Lady Nelson'' back to Port Jackson. She was sailing so poorly since losing her keels, that she not only delayed ''Investigator'', but ran great risk of herself being lost. Furthermore, instead of saving the crew of ''Investigator'', in case of accident, which was one of the main reasons for having a tender, it was likely ''Investigator'' might be called upon to save ''Lady Nelson''. Flinders saw ''Lady Nelson'', after her loss of anchors and cables, replacements for which ''Investigator'' could not spare without endangering her own safety, becoming a burden rather than an assistance.<ref>Flinders 1814, Vol. II, p. 96.</ref>\n\nMurray received orders from Flinders 'to proceed to Port Jackson with the Lady Nelson as fast as circumstances would allow', and a letter to deliver to Governor King.<ref>Flinders to King, His Majesty's Sloop Investigator, Off Cumberland Isles, 18 October 1802, HRNSW, Vol. IV, pp. 857\u2013860 and HRA, Ser.

This was the end of ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s voyages of discovery.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' headed south, anchoring occasionally with the broken anchor, but, when pausing at Cape Townshend on 28 October, this anchor was lost. The remaining anchor was let go, but, in the process, ''Lady Nelson'' drifted away from the intended anchorage. With only one remaining anchor, and only one small boat, ''Lady Nelson'' was in a precarious situation.\n\nAs it was essential to move to a safer anchorage, Murray improvised an anchor by lashing two swivel guns together, which enabled ''Lady Nelson'' to sail into a more sheltered anchorage in Shoalwater Bay. The carpenter then went ashore in the boat to find an iron-bark tree with which to make a replacement anchor.\n\nThe remainder of the voyage to Port Jackson was uneventful and ''Lady Nelson'' anchored in Sydney Cove at 10.40 am on 22 November 1802.\n\nBefore her next significant voyage, ''Lady Nelson'' made another trip to Norfolk Island to convey troops to relieve the garrison there. This was probably ''Lady Nelson''{{'s}} last voyage under Murray. ''Lady Nelsons''{{'}}s next commander was George Curtoys, (sometimes spelt Courtoys but spelt Curtoys in the commander's own log), previously the master's mate of {{HMS|Glatton|1795|6}}, which had arrived from England in March 1803.<ref>King to Nepean, 12 Apr. 1803, HRA, Ser.

The adverse winds continued for several days, driving her back to the north; on 21 June heavy seas resulted in the loss of the ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s boat. The safety of Twofold Bay was not reached until 24 June by which time all ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s supply of bread had been consumed and only three casks of water remained. A raft was constructed from her spars in order to get ashore to replenish their supply of fresh water and the ''Lady Nelson''{{'}}s carpenter was sent to cut timber with which to build a punt to replace the lost boat. ''Lady Nelson'' left Twofold Bay on 1 July to continue her voyage, but soon afterwards part of the main keel was seen drifting away astern. At this point the voyage was aborted and ''Lady Nelson'' returned to Port Jackson.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' arrived back in Port Jackson on 5 July and found that ''Porpoise'' had also turned back and had arrived two days earlier.<ref>''Gazette'', 17 Jul. 1803.</ref>\n\n''Lady Nelson'' departed again on 21 August 1803 but, two days out, her main mast was found to be sprung (damaged).

''Lady Nelson'' had a reasonably uneventful voyage and anchored in Risden Cove on the River Derwent on 9 September 1803. ''Albion'' arrived two days later. The next several days were employed in landing stores and establishing the settlers on shore. Both vessels had departed before the end of September leaving the settlement, comprising 49 souls, with no means of communication with the outside world.\n\n== Evacuation of the Settlement at Port Phillip ==\nIn October 1803 two ships, ''[[Ocean (1794 ship)|Ocean]]'' and {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|2}}, arrived in [[Port Phillip]], from England, with the intention of establishing a settlement. Lieutenant-Colonel [[David Collins (governor)|David Collins]] was to be Lieutenant-Governor of the new settlement.<ref>Hobart to Collins, 7 Feb.1803, TNA CO 202/6, AJCP PRO 56 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. IV, pp. 10\u201316.</ref> The venture was unsuccessful and a decision was taken to abandon the settlement and move its people to Van Diemen's Land. Two locations were considered: either the existing settlement on the Derwent, or a new settlement at Port Dalrymple.<ref>HRA, Ser. III, Vol. I, pp. xv\u2013xx.</ref>\n\nAs the only vessels available, ''Lady Nelson'' and ''Francis'', could not have carried out the task in a reasonable time, King hired the transport ''Ocean'' and the whaler ''Edwin'' to assist them. The 'fleet' therefore comprised four vessels.\n\nGeorge Curtoys, who had been ill for some time, had to relinquish command of ''Lady Nelson'' in November 1803, and returned to England in {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}}.<ref>King to Nepean, 1 Mar. 1804, HRA, Ser.

Twice ''Lady Nelson'' left the anchorage there to try to reach the destination, and twice she had to return.<ref>Robert Brown to Banks, at anchor, Kent's Group, Bass's Strait, 30 Dec. 1803, The British Library, MS 32439 folio 144 and AJCP M1139.</ref>\n\n''Ocean'' arrived at Port Phillip on 12 December 1803 and ''Francis'' the next day. The master of ''Francis'' reported to Colonel Collins having seen smoke rising from one of the islands in the Kent Group. This raised concerns over the safety of ''Lady Nelson'', which had not yet arrived at Port Phillip.\n\nColonel Collins sent William Collins, in ''Francis'', to assess the suitability of Port Dalrymple as a place to re-settle the people from Port Phillip.{{efn|William Collins was a former naval officer who had arrived on ''Ocean'' as a settler.}} The master of ''Francis'' was requested to sail via the Kent Group to look for ''Lady Nelson''.\n\nWilliam Collins found ''Lady Nelson'' in the Kent Group but by this time ''Francis'' herself was in a very leaky condition and was sent back to Port Jackson. William Collins continued to Port Dalrymple in ''Lady Nelson'', arriving there on 1 January 1804 and remaining until 18 January 1804. William Collins arrived back in Port Phillip, aboard ''Lady Nelson'' on 21 January 1804, with a favourable report on Port Dalrymple, but Colonel Collins had already decided to move to the Derwent.<ref>Collins to King, 27 Jan. 1804, HRA, Ser.

The next day the fore keel was found to have been broken-off and Symons decided to head into Twofold Bay for shelter and to carry out repairs to the vessel.\n\n''Lady Nelson'' anchored on the southern shore of Twofold Bay on 25 October and the crew again had to improvise a raft from the vessel's spars to get ashore. ''Lady Nelson'' got under way again on 3 November; attempts to leave on 1 and 2 November were both aborted due to the weather. She encountered the sloop ''George'', which was bound for the Derwent from Port Jackson, shortly after leaving Twofold Bay and its master gave a boat's compass to Symons to replace those lost in the storm.{{efn|''George'' was a sloop of 28 tons (bm), privately built on the Hawkesbury River.}}\n\nThe bad weather continued:\n*on 5 November 'the main top-sail blown out of the [[bolt rope]] and was lost',\n*on 6 November 'at 4 pm took in all sail'; and\n*on 7 November 'Strong gales and bad sea. At 8 blew the fore stay-sail totally away and split the main stay-sail.'\n\n''Lady Nelson'' headed down the western side of Flinders Island, sighted Cape Barren on 9 November, 'beat in through the narrows' and on 10 November reached Kent's Bay, on the south side of Cape Barren Island, where the schooner ''Francis'' was found at anchor, also sheltering from the weather. ''Lady Nelson'' remained in Kent's Bay, repairing storm damage, until 13 November when both vessels got under way. The next day ''Lady Nelson'' sought shelter at Waterhouse Island and remained there until 20 November when the weather improved.\n\n''Lady Nelson'', with ''Francis'' in company, finally reached Port Dalrymple on 21 November 1804. ''Buffalo'', a larger vessel, had arrived on 4 November 1804, and ''Integrity'' had arrived the next day.\n\nAfter she had unloaded her cargo, ''Lady Nelson'' was employed in surveying and erecting beacons in the harbour to facilitate the safe entry of ships into the new port.\n\n''Buffalo'' and ''Integrity'' departed on 27 November, and ''Francis'' on 29 December 1804. ''Lady Nelson'', the last of the small squadron to leave, departed on 11 January 1805. The settlement was initially located at Outer Cove on the east side of the River Tamar but soon relocated to York Cove on the west side of the river. Eventually the settlement was moved further up the river to a spot near the confluence of the North and South Esk rivers that Paterson named [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]]. ''Lady Nelson'' arrived back in Port Jackson on 23 January 1805.\n\n==Capture of ''Extreme\u00f1a''==\nIn April 1805 King received information that suggested that a Spanish armed schooner was anchored in [[Jervis Bay]], 90 miles to the south of Sydney. King sent ''Lady Nelson'', under the command of Acting-Lieutenant Symons, to look for the Spanish vessel and, if found, bring her to Port Jackson.\n\nThe Spanish vessel was [[Estremina|''Extreme\u00f1a'']], an armed merchant vessel owned by merchants in Madras had seized on the coast of Chile. Britain and Spain were not at war at the time of the seizure, which was therefore illegal. On sighting ''Lady Nelson'', ''Extreme\u00f1a'' tried to escape but Symons fired a shot across her bows, arrested her, and escorted her back to Port Jackson.\n\n==Later Service==\n''Lady Nelson'' continued to be employed in carrying passengers and supplies between Port Jackson and the other settlements along the coast of New South Wales and Tasmania for many years. Some of these voyages were recorded in the newspapers of the time. A few of these voyages are mentioned below where of particular interest.\n\nShe made a voyage to New Zealand in 1806 to return Tip-pa-he, a Maori Chief, to his residence.<ref>King to Camden, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1804 to 1805, 15 Mar. 1806, HRA, Ser.

In December 1824, Barlow sent ''Lady Nelson'' and George Miller, who was responsible for maintaining a supply of provisions, to the Dutch settlement at Kupang on the island of Timor for supplies.

{"title_page": "List of South African slang words", "text_new": "{{short description|wikimedia list article}}\n{{use South African English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\nSBWL SBWL\n\n== Afrikanerisms ==\n\nThis list of \"Afrikanerisms\" comprises slang words and phrases influenced by [[Afrikaans]]. Typical users include people with Afrikaans as their first language but who speak English as a second language and people living in areas where the population speaks both English and Afrikaans. Many of these terms also occur widely amongst ethnic/native South Africans, and others living in neighbouring countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia etc. These terms do not occur in formal [[South African English]]. Note when the letter \"g\" is either the first or last letter of the word or syllable, it is pronounced as an unvoiced velar fricative in the back of the throat. Note, words ending in \"-ng\" are pronounced identical to those in English. Note, in most cases of plurals ending in -nde, the \"d\" falls away in the informal pronunciation and spelling and the \"n\" is duplicated in sound and re-positioned within the degrees of comparison. For example: Tande (plural of tand; \"tooth\"), formal = \"tande\", informal = \"tanne\". In singular words' syllables ending in \"-d\", \"-nd\" and \"-heid\", the \"d\" is always pronounced as a \"t\". For example: \"ge-son(t)-hei(t)\" (gesondheid, \"health\"). Note, the English term ''slang'' is used strictly in its English pronunciation in context, as the Afrikaans word of the same spelling (though pronounced as \"slung\") translates as \"snake\".\n\nFanakalo ([[fanagalo]]) also refers to when people of non-Zulu origin attempt to speak Zulu without the proper pronunciation and throat sounds.\n''Fanakalo'' in Zulu literally means \"same as this\" \u2013 (fana \u2013 same, ka \u2013 as, lo \u2013 this).\n\n=== A\u2013M ===\n* ''aap'' \u2013 lit. ape/monkey.

Derived from the English \"aunt\", with the original meaning still intact.\n* ''anties'' \u2013 breasts/boobs\n* ''aweh/awe'' (pronounced \\AAAH-WHE\\) \u2013 said in excitement, as in: ''Aweh; my boss said I can go home early today.', 'or 'Ok, cool'.'

Refers to any person who has broken a law and got away with it. Derived from the Afrikaans word of the same spelling for \"to cuff\" (i.e. to arrest, or get arrested). The plural \"boewe\", refers both to multiple persons in arrest and the handcuffs themselves. Considered outdated as \"bliksem\" and \"skelm\" are more commonly used.\n* ''boer'' \u2013 literally \"farmer\" in Afrikaans.

Usually the term is primarily used by Southern Coastal regions to refer to the inland provinces that form a part of the plateau ([[Gauteng]] and [[Free State (province)|Free State province]]).\n*''bollie'' - lit \"to poop\". Of unknown origin, it is the Afrikaans equivalent of \"poop\". Due to the fact that it's the most child-friendly description of [[defecation]].\n* ''bokkie'' \u2013 (diminutive of ''bok'', literally meaning \"little buck\" or \"doe\") a popular term of endearment, comparable to \"sweetheart\", \"honey\", etc. Another meaning for the word ''bokkie (or bokbaardjie)'' is for a style of beard which is short (often pointy) and stylish and often surrounds just the mouth and chin in a circle. Based on the Afrikaans word ''bok'' (lit. \"buck\", as well as [[goat]]). \n* ''boom'' \u2013 marijuana (literally ''tree'')\n* ''bosberaad'' \u2013 strategy meeting held in a rural setting\n* ''bossies'', or ''bosbefok'' \u2013 crazy, whacko, mad.

'pantie lace'), the tie that you find on board shorts\n* ''bro/bra/bru/boet/boetie'' \u2013 a close male friend and a term of affection used by one male to another. All words are variations of the word \"broer\" in Afrikaans meaning \"brother\". ''Boetie'' (Pronounced 'Boet - tea') specifically means little brother in Afrikaans because of the \"ie\" diminutive suffix. You could say, \"Hey ''bro'', ''howzit''\" or \"Thanks a million ''bro'' for lending me your car\". When you refer to another male as ''bro'' is it because you consider that person to be such a good friend he is like a brother, a family member. ''Bro'' can also be used for strangers but only also if you wish to show a welcoming and friendly attitude towards them or when you want to deescalate tension in a friendly way as in \"Chill out ''bro''\". However you would certainly not walk around calling every man you see, ''bro'', because in South Africa the term is not used as loosely as it is in the US for example. \n* ''bring-en-braai/bring-and-braai'' \u2013 guests bring their own food and drink (usually pre-prepared, except for the meat) to the [[barbecue#South Africa|braai]].

Not to be confused with the \"Bokke\" ([[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbokke/Springbucks]]).\n* ''button'' \u2013 [[mandrax]] tablet (slang only)\n* ''[[braai]]'' \u2013 a [[barbecue]], to barbecue (from ''braaivleis'' \u2013 grilled meat), used as a mainstream word in South African English. Specifically to grill meat on an open fire. As a noun, it is also the literal area/object used for the grilling of the meat (in that case, the [[barbecue grill]] and stand) as well as the social gathering around it.\n* ''braaivleis'' \u2013 same as ''braai''\n* ''braaibroodjies'' \u2013 toasted sandwiches that are grilled over an open flame on a braai. Usually served as a side-dish to braaivleis.\n* ''cherry'' \u2013 \"meddie\", see ''tjerrie''\n* ''china/chine'' \u2013 a friend; as in the greeting ''Howzit my china?''

Also spelled ''tjommie''.\n* \"chop/tjop\" \u2013 it literally means a piece of meat (\"pork chop\" or \"lame chop\") that you would often cook on a ''braai''. If you can call someone a ''chop'' it means they are being silly or an acting like an idiot, \"Don't be a chop\". Calling someone a chop often does not mean any harm, it is a light and playful insult and this word is most commonly used in a friendly way between associates. It can also be meant in a teasing way, like \"dont be silly\".\n* ''chop-chop'' \u2013 lit. means \"quickly\". Is used when a person has had something done, or wants to have something done in a short amount of time. Derived from the chopping of a knife.\n* ''choty goty'' \u2013 beautiful girl\n* ''chrisco'' \u2013 a party/disco where Christian music mainly features; a combination of the words \"Christian\" and \"disco\"\n* ''Chwee chweereekeys'' \u2013 getting high\n* ''civvies'' \u2013 taken from the English term \"civilian wear\", it refers to day-to-day clothes worn when out of uniform.

Typical users include people with Afrikaans as their first language but who speak English as a second language and people living in areas where the population speaks both English and Afrikaans. Many of these terms also occur widely amongst ethnic/native South Africans, and others living in neighbouring countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia etc. These terms do not occur in formal [[South African English]]. Note when the letter \"g\" is either the first or last letter of the word or syllable, it is pronounced as an unvoiced velar fricative in the back of the throat. Note, words ending in \"-ng\" are pronounced identical to those in English. Note, in most cases of plurals ending in -nde, the \"d\" falls away in the informal pronunciation and spelling and the \"n\" is duplicated in sound and re-positioned within the degrees of comparison. For example: Tande (plural of tand; \"tooth\"), formal = \"tande\", informal = \"tanne\". In singular words' syllables ending in \"-d\", \"-nd\" and \"-heid\", the \"d\" is always pronounced as a \"t\". For example: \"ge-son(t)-hei(t)\" (gesondheid, \"health\"). Note, the English term ''slang'' is used strictly in its English pronunciation in context, as the Afrikaans word of the same spelling (though pronounced as \"slung\") translates as \"snake\".\n\nFanakalo ([[fanagalo]]) also refers to when people of non-Zulu origin attempt to speak Zulu without the proper pronunciation and throat sounds.\n''Fanakalo'' in Zulu literally means \"same as this\" \u2013 (fana \u2013 same, ka \u2013 as, lo \u2013 this).\n\n=== A\u2013M ===\n* ''aap'' \u2013 lit. ape/monkey.

Of unknown origin, it is the Afrikaans equivalent of \"poop\".

You could say, \"Hey ''bro'', ''howzit''\" or \"Thanks a million ''bro'' for lending me your car\". When you refer to another male as ''bro'' is it because you consider that person to be such a good friend he is like a brother, a family member. ''Bro'' can also be used for strangers but only also if you wish to show a welcoming and friendly attitude towards them or when you want to deescalate tension in a friendly way as in \"Chill out ''bro''\".
