The country was a [[one-party state]], governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] with [[Moscow]] as its capital in its largest republic, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (Russian SFSR). Other major urban centers were [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]], [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]], and [[Novosibirsk]]. It spanned over 10,000 kilometers (6,200&nbsp;mi) east to west across 11 [[time zone]]s, and over 7,200 kilometers (4,500&nbsp;mi) north to south. Its territory included much of [[Eastern Europe]], as well as part of [[Northern Europe]] and all of [[Northern Asia|Northern]] and [[Central Asia]]. It had five climate zones: [[tundra]], [[taiga]], [[steppe]]s, [[desert]] and [[mountain]]s.\n\nThe Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 [[October Revolution]], when the [[Bolsheviks]], led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] which had replaced the [[Tsarist autocracy|autocratic]] regime of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] during [[World War I]]. In 1922, after a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] ending in the Bolsheviks' victory, the USSR was formed by a [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|treaty]] which united the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian]], [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] and [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian]] republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin formalized the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party's ideology]] of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and replaced the [[New Economic Policy|market economy]] with a [[command economy]] which led to a period of [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialization]] and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]]. During this period, rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living, particularly in urban areas.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reassessing the Standard of Living in the Soviet Union: An Analysis Using Archival and Anthropometric Data |journal=Williams College |date=July 2008}}</ref> Despite these improvements, significant tragedies also occurred.  In addition to drought, which was a primary factor in a [[Droughts and famines in Russia and the USSR|long history of regularly occurring famines in the region]], agricultural collectivization contributed to a [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|major famine in 1932\u201333]], causing millions of deaths.  Political paranoia fermented, especially after the rise of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis in Germany]] in 1933, culminating in the [[Great Purge]], during which hundreds of thousands of persons accused of spying or sabotage were arrested and executed without trial.<ref name=\"Thurston\">{{cite book |last= Thurston|first=Robert W.|date=1998 |title=Life and Terror in Stalin's Russia, 1934\u20131941|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|page=139 |isbn=978-0-300-07442-0|author-link=Robert W.

In June 1941, Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]], opening the bloody [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet casualties]] accounted for the highest proportion of the war in the effort of acquiring the upper hand over the [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] at intense battles such as [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]]. In most of the territories occupied by the [[Red Army]] after its westward advance, local communists assumed power and formed governments allied with the Soviets. The post-war division of Europe into capitalist and communist halves led to increased tensions with the [[United States]]-led [[Western Bloc]], known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|died in 1953]] and was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who in 1956 [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denounced Stalin]] and began a period of liberal reforms known as [[de-Stalinization]]. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] occurred during Khrushchev's rule, which was among the many factors that led to his [[Nikita Khrushchev#Removal|removal in 1964]]. In the early 1970s, there was a brief [[d\u00e9tente]] of relations with the United States, but tensions resumed with the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] in 1979. After 1985, the last Soviet premier, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], sought to reform and liberalize political life and the economy through new policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring). These policies caused political instability arising from nationalist and separatist movements. In 1989, Soviet-allied states in [[Eastern Europe]] were overthrown in a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of revolutions]] which ended communist rule.\n\nAs part of an attempt to prevent the country's collapse, a [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum was held in March 1991]], boycotted by three republics, that resulted in a majority favoring the preservation of the union as a [[Union of Sovereign States|renewed federation]]. Gorbachev's power was greatly diminished after Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s high-profile role in facing down a [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup d'\u00e9tat]] by party hardliners. In late 1991, Gorbachev resigned, and the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] met and formally [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved the union]].

It took effective control over most of the countries of Eastern Europe (except [[Tito-Stalin split|Yugoslavia]] and later [[Soviet-Albanian split|Albania]]), turning them into [[satellite state]]s. The USSR bound its satellite states in a military alliance, the [[Warsaw Pact]], in 1955, and an economic organization, [[Comecon|The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] or Comecon, a counterpart to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), from 1949 to 1991.<ref name=\"fas.org\">{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/gru/ |title=Main Intelligence Administration (GRU) Glavnoye Razvedovatel'noye Upravlenie \u2013 Russia / Soviet Intelligence Agencies |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=24 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226090607/http://www.fas.org/irp/world/russia/gru/ |archive-date=26 December 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The USSR concentrated on its own recovery, seizing and transferring most of Germany's industrial plants, and it exacted [[World War II reparations|war reparations]] from [[East Germany]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], and [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises.

Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Union's wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, became its enemies. In the ensuing [[Cold War]], the two sides clashed indirectly in [[proxy war]]s.\n\n=== Khrushchev era ===\n{{Main|History of the Soviet Union (1953\u20131964)}}\n[[File:John Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev 1961.jpg|thumb|Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (left) with US President [[John F. Kennedy]] in Vienna, 3 June 1961]]\nStalin died on 5 March 1953. Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika headed by [[Georgy Malenkov]]. This did not last, however, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] eventually won the ensuing power struggle by the mid-1950s. In 1956, he [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denounced Stalin's use of repression]] and proceeded to ease controls over the party and society. This was known as [[de-Stalinization]].\n\nMoscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defence of its western borders, in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of 1941. For this reason, the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states, dependent upon and subservient to its leadership. Soviet military force was used to suppress anti-Stalinist uprisings in [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary]] and [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|Poland]] in 1956.\n\nIn the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the Soviet rapprochement with the West, and what [[Mao Zedong]] perceived as Khrushchev's [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]], led to the [[Sino\u2013Soviet split]]. This resulted in a break throughout the global Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, with the governments in [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[Democratic Kampuchea|Cambodia]] and [[Somali Democratic Republic|Somalia]] choosing to ally with China.\n\nDuring this period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the USSR continued to realize scientific and technological exploits in the [[Space Race]], rivaling the United States: launching the first artificial satellite, [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957; a living dog named [[Laika]] in 1957; the first human being, [[Yuri Gagarin]] in 1961; the first woman in space, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] in 1963; [[Alexei Leonov]], the first person to walk in space in 1965; the first soft landing on the Moon by spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966; and the first Moon rovers, [[Lunokhod 1]] and [[Lunokhod 2]].<ref name=\"lunokhod\">{{cite episode|title=Tank on the Moon |series=The Nature of Things with David Suzuki |network=CBC-TV |airdate=6 December 2007 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/magazine2.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226123643/http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/magazine2.html |archivedate=26 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nKhrushchev initiated \"[[Khrushchev Thaw|The Thaw]]\", a complex shift in political, cultural and economic life in the country. This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing a dramatic rise in living standards while maintaining high levels of economic growth. Censorship was relaxed as well. Khrushchev's reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive. In 1962, he precipitated a [[Cuban Missile Crisis|crisis with the United States]] over the Soviet deployment of [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]] in [[Cuba]]. An agreement was made with the United States to remove nuclear missiles from both Cuba and [[Turkey]], concluding the crisis. This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964.\n\n=== Brezhnev era ===\n{{Main|History of the Soviet Union (1964\u20131982)|History of the Soviet Union (1982\u20131991)|Era of Stagnation}}\n[[File:Carter Brezhnev sign SALT II.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet General Secretary [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and US President [[Jimmy Carter]] sign the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT II|SALT II arms limitation treaty]] in [[Vienna]] on 18 June 1979]]\nFollowing the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of [[collective leadership]] ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary, [[Alexei Kosygin]] as Premier and [[Nikolai Podgorny]] as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.\n\nIn 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded]] [[Czechoslovakia]] to halt the [[Prague Spring]] reforms. In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion along with the earlier invasions of Eastern European states by introducing the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], which claimed the right of the Soviet Union to violate the sovereignty of any country that attempted to replace Marxism\u2013Leninism with capitalism.\n\nBrezhnev presided throughout ''[[d\u00e9tente]]'' with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control ([[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT I Treaty|SALT I]], [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT II|SALT II]], [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]]) while at the same time building up Soviet military might.\n\nIn October 1977, the [[1977 Soviet Constitution|third Soviet Constitution]] was unanimously adopted. The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change. The long period of Brezhnev's rule had come to be dubbed one of \"standstill\"<!---\u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439--->, with an ageing and ossified top political leadership. This period is also known as the Era of Stagnation, a period of adverse economic, political, and social effects in the country, which began during the rule of Brezhnev and continued under his successors [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]].\n\nIn late 1979, the Soviet Union's military intervened in the ongoing [[Afghanistan conflict (1978\u2013present)|civil war in neighboring Afghanistan]], effectively ending a d\u00e9tente with the West.\n\n=== Gorbachev era ===\n{{Main|Cold War (1985\u20131991)|History of the Soviet Union (1982\u20131991)|1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt}}\n[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in one-to-one discussions with US President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]\n\nTwo developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in ''[[Beyond Oil]]'' that the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] encouraged [[Saudi Arabia]] to [[1980s oil glut|lower the price of oil]] to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, and resulted in the depletion of the country's [[hard currency]] reserves.<ref>Kenneth S. Deffeyes, Beyond Oil: The View from Hubbert's Peak.</ref>\n\nBrezhnev's next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long. [[Yuri Andropov]] was 68 years old and [[Konstantin Chernenko]] 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years. In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. He made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called ''[[perestroika]]''. His policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' freed public [[access to information]] after decades of heavy government censorship. Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War. In 1988, the USSR abandoned its [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]] and began to withdraw its forces. In the following year, [[Sinatra Doctrine|Gorbachev refused to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet satellite states]], which paved the way for the [[Revolutions of 1989]]. With the tearing down of the [[Berlin Wall]] and with East and West Germany pursuing unification, the [[Iron Curtain]] between [[Western Bloc|the West]] and Soviet-controlled regions came down.\n\nAt the same time, the Soviet republics started legal moves towards potentially declaring [[sovereignty]] over their territories, citing the freedom to secede in Article 72 of the USSR constitution.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050324050607/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v42/ai_9119705 The red blues \u2014 Soviet politics] by Brian Crozier, ''[[National Review]]'', 25 June 1990. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum.<ref>[http://www.rspp.su/sobor/conf_2006/istoki_duh_nrav_crisis.html Origins of Moral-Ethical Crisis and Ways to Overcome it] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928104220/http://www.rspp.su/sobor/conf_2006/istoki_duh_nrav_crisis.html |date=28 September 2007 }} by V.A.Drozhin Honoured Lawyer of Russia.</ref> Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990. Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the \"[[War of Laws]]\". In 1989, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies. [[Boris Yeltsin]] was elected its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory]] and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the Soviet laws. After a landslide victory of [[S\u0105j\u016bdis]] in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990.\n\nA [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum for the preservation of the USSR]] was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those republics voting for preservation of the Union. The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost. In the summer of 1991, the [[Union of Sovereign States|New Union Treaty]], which would have turned the country into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics. The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]]\u2014an attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics. After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended. The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example). Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterwards, the party's activities were indefinitely suspended\u2014effectively ending its rule. By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected [[President of Russia]] in July 1991.\n\n=== Dissolution ===\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Commonwealth of Independent States}}\nThe remaining 12 republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union. However, by December all except Russia and [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] had formally declared independence. During this time, Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government, including the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. The final blow was struck on 1 December when Ukraine, the second-most powerful republic, [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|voted overwhelmingly for independence]]. Ukraine's secession ended any realistic chance of the country staying together even on a limited scale.\n\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|Changes in national boundaries after the end of the [[Cold War]]]]\n\nOn 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and [[Belarus]] (formerly Byelorussia), signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in its place. While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]] signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the accords. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct. He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin. That night, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the [[Flag of Russia|Russian tricolor]] was raised in its place.\n\nThe following day, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]], the highest governmental body, voted both itself and the country out of existence. This is generally recognized as marking the official, final [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] as a functioning state, and the end of the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vt5OLD3vp4UC&pg=PR5&lpg=PR5&dq=26+december+1991+ussr#v=onepage&q=26%20december%201991%20ussr&f=false | title=Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States: Documents, Data, and Analysis| isbn=978-1-56324-637-1| last1=Brzezinski| first1=Zbigniew| last2=Brzezinski| first2=Zbigniew K| last3=Sullivan| first3=Paige| year=1997}}</ref> The Soviet Army initially remained under overall CIS command but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states.

To that end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed Soviet overseas properties as its own. Under the 1992 [[Lisbon Protocol]], Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics. Since then, the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations. [[Ukraine]] has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the USSR and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was codified in Articles 7 and 8 of its 1991 law [[On Legal Succession of Ukraine]]. Since its independence in 1991, Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the USSR.\n\n[[File:Refugeesaz.jpg|thumb|Internally displaced [[Azerbaijan]]is from Nagorno-Karabakh, 1993]]\n[[File:USSR - Then and Now.png|thumb|Country emblems of the Soviet Republics before and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union (note that the [[Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (fifth in the second row) no longer exists as a political entity of any kind and the emblem is unofficial).]]\n\nThe dissolution was followed by a severe drop in economic and social conditions in [[post-Soviet states]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/966616.stm \"Child poverty soars in eastern Europe\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512034826/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/966616.stm |date=12 May 2011 }}, BBC News, 11 October 2000</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Parenti|first=Michael|title=Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism|date=1997|publisher=[[City Lights Bookstore|City Lights Books]]|isbn=978-0872863293|page=118|authorlink=Michael Parenti}}</ref> including a rapid increase in poverty,<ref name=\"Scheidel\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=McAaley|first1=Alastair|title=Russia and the Baltics: Poverty and Poverty Research in a Changing World|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8M3JFdbXA7sJ:www.crop.org/viewfile.aspx%3Fid%3D381+&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=nz|accessdate=18 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123224044/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3A8M3JFdbXA7sJ%3Awww.crop.org%2Fviewfile.aspx%3Fid%3D381+&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=nz|archive-date=23 January 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=An epidemic of street kids overwhelms Russian cities|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/an-epidemic-of-street-kids-overwhelms-russian-cities/article4141933/|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=17 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828195036/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/an-epidemic-of-street-kids-overwhelms-russian-cities/article4141933/|archive-date=28 August 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Targ|first1=Harry|title=Challenging Late Capitalism, Neoliberal Globalization, & Militarism|date=2006}}</ref> crime,<ref>Theodore P.

It became the duty of the Russian Bolsheviks to protect what they had in Russia, and avoid military confrontations that might destroy their bridgehead. Russia was now a pariah state, along with Germany. The two came to terms in 1922 with the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]] that settled long-standing grievances.

The [[United Kingdom]] dismissed the warnings of [[Winston Churchill]] and a few others about a continuing communist threat, and opened trade relations and ''de facto'' diplomatic recognition in 1922. There was hope for a settlement of the pre-war tsarist debts, but it was repeatedly postponed.

After the severe economic collapse, Lenin replaced war communism by the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) in 1921, legalizing free trade and private ownership of small businesses.

Health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, a revolutionary concept at the time. Article 42 of the [[1977 Soviet Constitution]] gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR. Before [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became General Secretary, the Soviet healthcare system was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists. This changed, however, from Brezhnev's accession and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s tenure as leader, during which the health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|1992|p=352}}</ref> [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|Minister of Health]] [[Yevgeniy Chazov]], during the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], while highlighting such successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world, recognized the system's areas for improvement and felt that billions of [[Soviet ruble]]s were squandered.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|1992|pp=352\u201353}}</ref> <!-- Billions in the previous line was prior milliard, but was changed according to [[WP:MOSNUM]].

This statistic in itself was seen by some that the [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] was superior to the [[Capitalism|capitalist system]]. These improvements continued into the 1960s when statistics indicated that the life expectancy briefly surpassed that of the United States. Life expectancy started to decline in the 1970s, possibly because of [[Alcohol consumption in Russia|alcohol abuse]]. At the same time, infant mortality began to rise. After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on the matter. This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was the highest while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"SeemingParadox\">{{cite journal|author= Dinkel, R.H. |title=The Seeming Paradox of Increasing Mortality in a Highly Industrialized Nation: the Example of the Soviet Union|journal=Population Studies|pages=155\u201377|year=1990|volume=39|issue=1|doi=10.1080/0032472031000141296|pmid=11611752}}</ref>\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Main|Languages of the Soviet Union}}\nUnder Lenin, the government gave small language groups their own writing systems.<ref>{{harvnb|Comrie|1981|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> The development of these writing systems was highly successful, even though some flaws were detected.

During the first decade following the revolution, there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art. Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people. On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, such as [[Nikolay Gumilyov]] who was shot for alleged conspiring against the Bolshevik regime, and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]].<ref>'On the other hand...' See the index of ''Stalin and His Hangmen'' by Donald Rayfield, 2004, Random House</ref>\n\nThe government encouraged a variety of trends. In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] were active during this time. As a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, films received encouragement from the state, and much of director [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s best work dates from this period.\n\nDuring Stalin's rule, the Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of [[socialist realism]], with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, such as [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s works. Many writers were imprisoned and killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Rayfield|2004|pp=317\u2013320}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], censorship was diminished. During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed, characterized by conformist public life and an intense focus on personal life. Greater experimentation in art forms was again permissible, resulting in the production of more sophisticated and subtly critical work. The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author [[Yury Trifonov]] concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. Underground dissident literature, known as ''[[samizdat]]'', developed during this late period. In architecture, the Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalin's epoch.\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Gorbachev's policies of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' significantly expanded [[freedom of expression]] throughout the country in the media and the press.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gorbachev, Mikhail|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|date=2 October 2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037405&gt|quotation=\"Under his new policy of glasnost (\"openness\"), a major cultural thaw took place: freedoms of expression and of information were significantly expanded; the press and broadcasting were allowed unprecedented candor in their reportage and criticism; and the country's legacy of Stalinist totalitarian rule was eventually completely repudiated by the government.\"|accessdate=1 December 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Sport ==\n{{See also|Voluntary Sports Societies of the Soviet Union|CSKA Moscow|Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union men's national ice hockey team}}\n[[File:RR5110-0098R.png|thumb|[[Valeri Kharlamov]] represented the Soviet Union at 11 [[IIHF Men's World Championship|Ice Hockey World Championships]], winning eight gold medals, two silvers and one bronze.]]\n\nFounded on 20 July 1924 in Moscow, ''[[Sovetsky Sport]]'' was the first sports newspaper of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe [[Soviet Olympic Committee]] formed on 21 April 1951, and the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] recognized the new body in its [[List of IOC meetings|45th session]].

Portugalov later became one of the leading figures involved in the implementation of Russian doping before the 2016 Summer Olympics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html?_r=0|date=13 August 2016|first=Rebecca R.|last=Ruiz|website=nytimes.com|title=The Soviet Doping Plan: Document Reveals Illicit Approach to '84 Olympics|accessdate=15 January 2018|quote=The document \u2013 obtained by The New York Times from a former chief medical doctor for Soviet track and field \u2013 was signed by Dr. Sergei Portugalov, a Soviet sports doctor who went on to capitalize on a growing interest in new methods of doping. [...] Now, more than 30 years later, Dr. Portugalov is a central figure in Russia's current doping scandal. Last fall, the World Anti-Doping Agency named him as a key broker of performance-enhancing drugs in Russia, someone who in recent years injected athletes personally and made a business of covering up drug violations in exchange for money. [...] Dr. Portugalov came to global prominence in 2014 when two Russian whistle-blowers identified him as a linchpin distributor in Russia's state-run doping scheme.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201055317/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html?_r=0|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Soviet Union|Communism|Russia|Europe|Asia}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]]\n* [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]\n* [[Communism]]\n* [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Eurasian Economic Union]]\n* [[Ideocracy]]\n* [[Index of Soviet Union-related articles]]\n* [[Neo-Sovietism]]\n* [[Orphans in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Soviet Empire]]\n* [[France\u2013Russia relations#USSR: 1918-1991]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Conflicts ===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Cold War]]\n* [[Operation Barbarossa]]\n* [[Russian Civil War]]\n* [[Soviet Invasion of Poland]]\n* [[Sino-Soviet split]]\n* [[Sino-Soviet border clashes]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Nationalities ===\n{{div col}}\n*[[Baltic states under Soviet rule (1944\u201391)]]\n*[[Islam in the Soviet Union]]\n*[[Soviet people]]\n*[[Korenizatsiya]]\n*[[Ukrainian nationalism]]\n*[[Soviet Central Asia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n{{notes}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book |author1=Ambler, John |author2=Shaw, Denis J.B. |author3=Symons, Leslie|title=Soviet and East European Transport Problems|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rpg9AAAAIAAJ&dq|isbn=978-0-7099-0557-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Comrie|first=Bernard|title=The Languages of the Soviet Union|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge University Press (CUP) Archive]]|year=1981|url=https://archive.org/details/languagesofsovie0000comr|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0-521-29877-3|authorlink=Bernard Comrie|ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert William Davies|last2=Wheatcroft|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen G.

The country was a [[one-party state]], governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] with [[Moscow]] as its capital in its largest republic, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (Russian SFSR). Other major urban centers were [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]], [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]], and [[Novosibirsk]]. It spanned over 10,000 kilometers (6,200&nbsp;mi) east to west across 11 [[time zone]]s, and over 7,200 kilometers (4,500&nbsp;mi) north to south. Its territory included much of [[Eastern Europe]], as well as part of [[Northern Europe]] and all of [[Northern Asia|Northern]] and [[Central Asia]]. It had five climate zones: [[tundra]], [[taiga]], [[steppe]]s, [[desert]] and [[mountain]]s.\n\nThe Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 [[October Revolution]], when the [[Bolsheviks]], led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] which had replaced the [[Tsarist autocracy|autocratic]] regime of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] during [[World War I]]. In 1922, after a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] ending in the Bolsheviks' victory, the USSR was formed by a [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|treaty]] which united the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian]], [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] and [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian]] republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin formalized the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party's ideology]] of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and replaced the [[New Economic Policy|market economy]] with a [[command economy]] which led to a period of [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialization]] and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]]. During this period, rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living, particularly in urban areas.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reassessing the Standard of Living in the Soviet Union: An Analysis Using Archival and Anthropometric Data |journal=Williams College |date=July 2008}}</ref> Despite these improvements, significant tragedies also occurred.  In addition to drought, which was a primary factor in a [[Droughts and famines in Russia and the USSR|long history of regularly occurring famines in the region]], agricultural collectivization contributed to a [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|major famine in 1932\u201333]], causing millions of deaths.  Political paranoia fermented, especially after the rise of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis in Germany]] in 1933, culminating in the [[Great Purge]], during which hundreds of thousands of persons accused of spying or sabotage were arrested and executed without trial.<ref name=\"Thurston\">{{cite book |last= Thurston|first=Robert W.|date=1998 |title=Life and Terror in Stalin's Russia, 1934\u20131941|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|page=139 |isbn=978-0-300-07442-0|author-link=Robert W.

In June 1941, Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]], opening the bloody [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet casualties]] accounted for the highest proportion of the war in the effort of acquiring the upper hand over the [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] at intense battles such as [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]]. In most of the territories occupied by the [[Red Army]] after its westward advance, local communists assumed power and formed governments allied with the Soviets. The post-war division of Europe into capitalist and communist halves led to increased tensions with the [[United States]]-led [[Western Bloc]], known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|died in 1953]] and was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who in 1956 [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denounced Stalin]] and began a period of liberal reforms known as [[de-Stalinization]]. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] occurred during Khrushchev's rule, which was among the many factors that led to his [[Nikita Khrushchev#Removal|removal in 1964]]. In the early 1970s, there was a brief [[d\u00e9tente]] of relations with the United States, but tensions resumed with the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] in 1979. After 1985, the last Soviet premier, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], sought to reform and liberalize political life and the economy through new policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring). These policies caused political instability arising from nationalist and separatist movements. In 1989, Soviet-allied states in [[Eastern Europe]] were overthrown in a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of revolutions]] which ended communist rule.\n\nAs part of an attempt to prevent the country's collapse, a [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum was held in March 1991]], boycotted by three republics, that resulted in a majority favoring the preservation of the union as a [[Union of Sovereign States|renewed federation]]. Gorbachev's power was greatly diminished after Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s high-profile role in facing down a [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup d'\u00e9tat]] by party hardliners. In late 1991, Gorbachev resigned, and the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] met and formally [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved the union]].

Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Union's wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, became its enemies. In the ensuing [[Cold War]], the two sides clashed indirectly in [[proxy war]]s.\n\n=== Khrushchev era ===\n{{Main|History of the Soviet Union (1953\u20131964)}}\n[[File:John Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev 1961.jpg|thumb|Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (left) with US President [[John F. Kennedy]] in Vienna, 3 June 1961]]\nStalin died on 5 March 1953. Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika headed by [[Georgy Malenkov]]. This did not last, however, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] eventually won the ensuing power struggle by the mid-1950s. In 1956, he [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denounced Stalin's use of repression]] and proceeded to ease controls over the party and society. This was known as [[de-Stalinization]].\n\nMoscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defence of its western borders, in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of 1941. For this reason, the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states, dependent upon and subservient to its leadership. Soviet military force was used to suppress anti-Stalinist uprisings in [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary]] and [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|Poland]] in 1956.\n\nIn the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the Soviet rapprochement with the West, and what [[Mao Zedong]] perceived as Khrushchev's [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]], led to the [[Sino\u2013Soviet split]]. This resulted in a break throughout the global Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, with the governments in [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[Democratic Kampuchea|Cambodia]] and [[Somali Democratic Republic|Somalia]] choosing to ally with China.\n\nDuring this period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the USSR continued to realize scientific and technological exploits in the [[Space Race]], rivaling the United States: launching the first artificial satellite, [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957; a living dog named [[Laika]] in 1957; the first human being, [[Yuri Gagarin]] in 1961; the first woman in space, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] in 1963; [[Alexei Leonov]], the first person to walk in space in 1965; the first soft landing on the Moon by spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966; and the first Moon rovers, [[Lunokhod 1]] and [[Lunokhod 2]].<ref name=\"lunokhod\">{{cite episode|title=Tank on the Moon |series=The Nature of Things with David Suzuki |network=CBC-TV |airdate=6 December 2007 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/magazine2.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226123643/http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/magazine2.html |archivedate=26 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nKhrushchev initiated \"[[Khrushchev Thaw|The Thaw]]\", a complex shift in political, cultural and economic life in the country. This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing a dramatic rise in living standards while maintaining high levels of economic growth. Censorship was relaxed as well. Khrushchev's reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive. In 1962, he precipitated a [[Cuban Missile Crisis|crisis with the United States]] over the Soviet deployment of [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]] in [[Cuba]]. An agreement was made with the United States to remove nuclear missiles from both Cuba and [[Turkey]], concluding the crisis. This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964.\n\n=== Brezhnev era ===\n{{Main|History of the Soviet Union (1964\u20131982)|History of the Soviet Union (1982\u20131991)|Era of Stagnation}}\n[[File:Carter Brezhnev sign SALT II.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet General Secretary [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and US President [[Jimmy Carter]] sign the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT II|SALT II arms limitation treaty]] in [[Vienna]] on 18 June 1979]]\nFollowing the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of [[collective leadership]] ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary, [[Alexei Kosygin]] as Premier and [[Nikolai Podgorny]] as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.\n\nIn 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded]] [[Czechoslovakia]] to halt the [[Prague Spring]] reforms. In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion along with the earlier invasions of Eastern European states by introducing the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], which claimed the right of the Soviet Union to violate the sovereignty of any country that attempted to replace Marxism\u2013Leninism with capitalism.\n\nBrezhnev presided throughout ''[[d\u00e9tente]]'' with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control ([[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT I Treaty|SALT I]], [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT II|SALT II]], [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]]) while at the same time building up Soviet military might.\n\nIn October 1977, the [[1977 Soviet Constitution|third Soviet Constitution]] was unanimously adopted. The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change. The long period of Brezhnev's rule had come to be dubbed one of \"standstill\"<!---\u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439--->, with an ageing and ossified top political leadership. This period is also known as the Era of Stagnation, a period of adverse economic, political, and social effects in the country, which began during the rule of Brezhnev and continued under his successors [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]].\n\nIn late 1979, the Soviet Union's military intervened in the ongoing [[Afghanistan conflict (1978\u2013present)|civil war in neighboring Afghanistan]], effectively ending a d\u00e9tente with the West.\n\n=== Gorbachev era ===\n{{Main|Cold War (1985\u20131991)|History of the Soviet Union (1982\u20131991)|1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt}}\n[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in one-to-one discussions with US President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]\n\nTwo developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in ''[[Beyond Oil]]'' that the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] encouraged [[Saudi Arabia]] to [[1980s oil glut|lower the price of oil]] to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, and resulted in the depletion of the country's [[hard currency]] reserves.<ref>Kenneth S. Deffeyes, Beyond Oil: The View from Hubbert's Peak.</ref>\n\nBrezhnev's next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long. [[Yuri Andropov]] was 68 years old and [[Konstantin Chernenko]] 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years. In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. He made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called ''[[perestroika]]''. His policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' freed public [[access to information]] after decades of heavy government censorship. Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War. In 1988, the USSR abandoned its [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]] and began to withdraw its forces. In the following year, [[Sinatra Doctrine|Gorbachev refused to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet satellite states]], which paved the way for the [[Revolutions of 1989]]. With the tearing down of the [[Berlin Wall]] and with East and West Germany pursuing unification, the [[Iron Curtain]] between [[Western Bloc|the West]] and Soviet-controlled regions came down.\n\nAt the same time, the Soviet republics started legal moves towards potentially declaring [[sovereignty]] over their territories, citing the freedom to secede in Article 72 of the USSR constitution.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050324050607/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v42/ai_9119705 The red blues \u2014 Soviet politics] by Brian Crozier, ''[[National Review]]'', 25 June 1990. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum.<ref>[http://www.rspp.su/sobor/conf_2006/istoki_duh_nrav_crisis.html Origins of Moral-Ethical Crisis and Ways to Overcome it] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928104220/http://www.rspp.su/sobor/conf_2006/istoki_duh_nrav_crisis.html |date=28 September 2007 }} by V.A.Drozhin Honoured Lawyer of Russia.</ref> Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990. Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the \"[[War of Laws]]\". In 1989, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies. [[Boris Yeltsin]] was elected its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory]] and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the Soviet laws. After a landslide victory of [[S\u0105j\u016bdis]] in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990.\n\nA [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum for the preservation of the USSR]] was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those republics voting for preservation of the Union. The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost. In the summer of 1991, the [[Union of Sovereign States|New Union Treaty]], which would have turned the country into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics. The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]]\u2014an attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics. After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended. The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example). Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterwards, the party's activities were indefinitely suspended\u2014effectively ending its rule. By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected [[President of Russia]] in July 1991.\n\n=== Dissolution ===\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Commonwealth of Independent States}}\nThe remaining 12 republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union. However, by December all except Russia and [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] had formally declared independence. During this time, Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government, including the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. The final blow was struck on 1 December when Ukraine, the second-most powerful republic, [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|voted overwhelmingly for independence]]. Ukraine's secession ended any realistic chance of the country staying together even on a limited scale.\n\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|Changes in national boundaries after the end of the [[Cold War]]]]\n\nOn 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and [[Belarus]] (formerly Byelorussia), signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in its place. While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]] signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the accords. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct. He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin.

Due to rigid state planning and [[Nomenklatura|bureaucracy]], the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry, biology, and computers when compared to the [[First World]].\n\nUnder the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], [[Project Socrates]] determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using. In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous [[research and development]] as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors. In contrast, the USSR was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage. However, technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility. This was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Global Tech Strategies Brought to U.S|journal=Washington Technology|date=3 May 1990|first=Margo|last=MacFarland}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=R.A.|last=Deckert|title=The science of uncovering industrial information|date=10 October 1990|work=Business Journal of the Treasure Coast}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Firms Must Trade Short-Term Gains for Long-Term Technology Planning|date=7 March 1991|work=Inside the Pentagon}}</ref>\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{Main|Transport in the Soviet Union}}\n[[File:Flag of the Aeroflot.svg|thumb|[[Aeroflot]]'s flag during the Soviet era]]\n\nTransport was a vital component of the country's economy.

Article 42 of the [[1977 Soviet Constitution]] gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR. Before [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became General Secretary, the Soviet healthcare system was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists. This changed, however, from Brezhnev's accession and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s tenure as leader, during which the health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|1992|p=352}}</ref> [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|Minister of Health]] [[Yevgeniy Chazov]], during the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], while highlighting such successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world, recognized the system's areas for improvement and felt that billions of [[Soviet ruble]]s were squandered.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|1992|pp=352\u201353}}</ref> <!-- Billions in the previous line was prior milliard, but was changed according to [[WP:MOSNUM]].

This statistic in itself was seen by some that the [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] was superior to the [[Capitalism|capitalist system]]. These improvements continued into the 1960s when statistics indicated that the life expectancy briefly surpassed that of the United States. Life expectancy started to decline in the 1970s, possibly because of [[Alcohol consumption in Russia|alcohol abuse]]. At the same time, infant mortality began to rise. After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on the matter.

During the first decade following the revolution, there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art. Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people. On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, such as [[Nikolay Gumilyov]] who was shot for alleged conspiring against the Bolshevik regime, and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]].<ref>'On the other hand...' See the index of ''Stalin and His Hangmen'' by Donald Rayfield, 2004, Random House</ref>\n\nThe government encouraged a variety of trends. In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] were active during this time. As a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, films received encouragement from the state, and much of director [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s best work dates from this period.\n\nDuring Stalin's rule, the Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of [[socialist realism]], with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, such as [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s works. Many writers were imprisoned and killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Rayfield|2004|pp=317\u2013320}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], censorship was diminished. During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed, characterized by conformist public life and an intense focus on personal life. Greater experimentation in art forms was again permissible, resulting in the production of more sophisticated and subtly critical work. The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author [[Yury Trifonov]] concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. Underground dissident literature, known as ''[[samizdat]]'', developed during this late period. In architecture, the Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalin's epoch.\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Gorbachev's policies of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' significantly expanded [[freedom of expression]] throughout the country in the media and the press.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gorbachev, Mikhail|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|date=2 October 2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037405&gt|quotation=\"Under his new policy of glasnost (\"openness\"), a major cultural thaw took place: freedoms of expression and of information were significantly expanded; the press and broadcasting were allowed unprecedented candor in their reportage and criticism; and the country's legacy of Stalinist totalitarian rule was eventually completely repudiated by the government.\"|accessdate=1 December 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Sport ==\n{{See also|Voluntary Sports Societies of the Soviet Union|CSKA Moscow|Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union men's national ice hockey team}}\n[[File:RR5110-0098R.png|thumb|[[Valeri Kharlamov]] represented the Soviet Union at 11 [[IIHF Men's World Championship|Ice Hockey World Championships]], winning eight gold medals, two silvers and one bronze.]]\n\nFounded on 20 July 1924 in Moscow, ''[[Sovetsky Sport]]'' was the first sports newspaper of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe [[Soviet Olympic Committee]] formed on 21 April 1951, and the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] recognized the new body in its [[List of IOC meetings|45th session]].

Dated before the decision to boycott the 1984 Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture prepared the communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field.

Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites.

The U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a [[Ammunition|munition]] and placed it back under the restrictive [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] in 1998.<ref name=\"zenio2006\">{{cite news|last1=Zelnio|first1=Ryan|title=A short history of export control policy|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/528/1|work=The Space Review |date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> No license to launch U.S. spacecraft on Chinese rockets has been approved by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] since then, and an official at the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] emphasized in 2016 that \"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it's incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China\".<ref name=\"selding2016\">{{cite news|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=U.S. ITAR satellite export regime's effects still strong in Europe|url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-itar-satellite-export-regimes-effects-still-strong-in-europe/|work=SpaceNews|date=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-D partial launch failure ===\nOn 31 August 2009, during the launch of [[Palapa-D]], the third stage engine under-performed and placed the satellite into a lower than planned orbit. The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16 years. The investigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine's gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was a foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine's liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn 19 June 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying [[ChinaSat_9A|ChinaSat-9A]] ended in partial failure. Officials did not release details regarding the status of the mission for at least 4 hours after liftoff.<ref>http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-3b-zhongxing-9a-launch/</ref> Two weeks later, on 7 July 2017, officials confirmed that the mission had been anomalous, with Space Daily reporting that \"an anomaly was found on the carrier rocket's rolling control thruster, part of the attitude control engine, during the third gliding phase\". The failure in the rocket's third stage left the payload in a lower than intended orbit, and the payload was forced to spend two weeks reaching its intended orbit under its own power.<ref>http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Chinese_satellite_Zhongxing_9A_enters_preset_orbit_999.html</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua) launch failure ===\nOn 9 April 2020, a Long March 3B launcher failed after lifting off from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in the southwestern [[Sichuan]] province at 11:46 UTC during the launch of an Indonesian communications satellite, [[Nusantara Satu|Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua)]]. But the rocket malfunctioned minutes later, during the planned burn of the third stage. Wreckage from the third stage and the Palapa-N1 spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere, leading to sightings of fiery debris in the skies over Guam. With the Long March 3B failure, Chinese rockets have faltered on two missions in less than a month. A Long March 7A rocket failed to place a satellite in orbit on 16 March 2020 after taking off from the [[Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site]] on [[Hainan Island]], located in southern

Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites. The Long March 3B also served as the basis for the medium-capacity [[Long March 3C]], which was first launched in 2008.\n\n{{As of|2020|04}}, the Long March 3B and 3B/E have conducted 63<!-- UPDATE after each launch --> successful launches, plus two failures and two partial failures, giving them a success rate of {{percent|63|67|1}}.<!-- UPDATE after each launch -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:CZ-3B.svg|thumb|left|70px|A diagram of the Long March 3B, showing its outboard liquid rocket boosters.]]\n\nThe development of the Long March 3B began in 1986 to meet the needs of the international GEO communications satellite market.

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States since the information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles. The U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a [[Ammunition|munition]] and placed it back under the restrictive [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] in 1998.<ref name=\"zenio2006\">{{cite news|last1=Zelnio|first1=Ryan|title=A short history of export control policy|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/528/1|work=The Space Review |date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> No license to launch U.S. spacecraft on Chinese rockets has been approved by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] since then, and an official at the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] emphasized in 2016 that \"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it's incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China\".<ref name=\"selding2016\">{{cite news|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=U.S. ITAR satellite export regime's effects still strong in Europe|url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-itar-satellite-export-regimes-effects-still-strong-in-europe/|work=SpaceNews|date=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-D partial launch failure ===\nOn 31 August 2009, during the launch of [[Palapa-D]], the third stage engine under-performed and placed the satellite into a lower than planned orbit. The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16 years. The investigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine's gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was a foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine's liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn 19 June 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying [[ChinaSat_9A|ChinaSat-9A]] ended in partial failure. Officials did not release details regarding the status of the mission for at least 4 hours after liftoff.<ref>http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-3b-zhongxing-9a-launch/</ref> Two weeks later, on 7 July 2017, officials confirmed that the mission had been anomalous, with Space Daily reporting that \"an anomaly was found on the carrier rocket's rolling control thruster, part of the attitude control engine, during the third gliding phase\". The failure in the rocket's third stage left the payload in a lower than intended orbit, and the payload was forced to spend two weeks reaching its intended orbit under its own power.<ref>http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Chinese_satellite_Zhongxing_9A_enters_preset_orbit_999.html</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua) launch failure ===\nOn 9 April 2020, a Long March 3B launcher failed after lifting off from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in the southwestern [[Sichuan]] province at 11:46 UTC during the launch of an Indonesian communications satellite, [[Nusantara Satu|Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua)]]. But the rocket malfunctioned minutes later, during the planned burn of the third stage. Wreckage from the third stage and the Palapa-N1 spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere, leading to sightings of fiery debris in the skies over Guam. With the Long March 3B failure, Chinese rockets have faltered on two missions in less than a month. A Long March 7A rocket failed to place a satellite in orbit on 16 March 2020 after taking off from the [[Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site]] on [[Hainan Island]], located in southern China.<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/09/chinese-rocket-fails-during-launch-of-indonesian-communications-satellite/ - 9 April 2020</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight|China}}\n*[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/report/1999/3b.htm LM-3B User's Manual] at GlobalSecurity.org\n*[http://www.calt.com/english/ps/index.html Long March-3B (LM-3B)] at the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology\n\n{{Long March rockets}}\n{{Expendable launch systems}}\n{{CLEP}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Long March 3b}}\n[[Category:Long March (rocket family)]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1996]]\n", "name_user": "CRS-20", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIntelsat 708 launch failure", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_3B"}

[[Comic Book Resources]].</ref> The series ended after issue #262, after 114 issues.\n\n==Fictional team history==\n'''X-Factor Investigations''' is a detective agency run by [[Jamie Madrox]], formerly known as the costumed superhero Multiple Man. The agency was originally named ''XXX Investigations'', but team members thought that it sounded too much like Madrox was investigating [[pornography]]. The new name is taken from the government-sponsored mutant supergroup that the three founders had previously served on.\n\n===\"Madrox\" and \"Decimation\"===\nThe initial staff consisted of Madrox's best friend and special enforcer, Guido Carosella ([[Strong Guy]]) and former teammate Rahne Sinclair ([[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]). Following the [[House of M]], Madrox's newfound wealth from winning a ''[[Who Wants to be a Millionaire]]''-style [[game show]] allowed him to recruit several of his former colleagues of the [[Paris]] branch of the now defunct [[X-Corporation]]. New members include [[Siryn]], a powerless [[Rictor]], [[M (Marvel Comics)|M]] and [[Layla Miller]], who has inserted herself into the group to keep them from discovering the truth behind the mutant Decimation, a catastrophic worldwide wiping out of mutant powers that took place during [[Decimation (comics)|a storyline of the same name]]. The agency subsequently conflict with rival agency Singularity Investigations, after they ordered Siryn beaten and left for dead.{{issue|date=November 2013}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the \"Decimation\" storyline, Madrox, after meeting with Singularity CEO Damian Tryp, asks Siryn to find out more about the Decimation from the heroes who might have been involved. She learns from Spider-Man that the X-Men (who had denied any involvement), as well as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] were, in fact, central to the ending of that event.{{issue|date=November 2013}}\n\nLittle is known about Damian Tryp apart from that he runs Singularity Investigations, which is in direct competition with Jamie Madrox's X-Factor Investigations and his encounters with Madrox's team. He is also one of the few mutants that kept their superhuman powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] event, although it has been revealed that he might not be a mutant, but a genetic throwback to an earlier time,<ref name=\"xfactorv3-11\">{{cite comic|writer = David, Peter|artist =[[Roy Allen Martinez|Martinez, Roy Allen]]|story = untitled |title = X-Factor|volume=volume 3|issue = 11|date = November 2006|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> (a \"changeling\"), a predecessor to mutants who develop powers at birth. Tryp's mutation enables him to live for a very long time, as evidenced by him being alive in the 12th-century Wales.<ref name=\"xfactorv3-10\">{{comic book reference | Writer =David, Peter|Artist =Martinez, Roy Allen |story = untitled | Title = X-Factor|volume= 3 | Issue = 10 | Date = October 2006 | Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> He also is able to move through time in a similar fashion to Quicksilver, which enables him to bring together himself at three different times.\n\nDamian Tryp also seems to be involved in Jamie Madrox\u2019s past. When Jamie was born, the doctor\u2019s slap caused him to multiply into two identical babies, which was rather shocking to both his parents and the doctor. [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], a friend of the Madrox family, suggested that they move to Kansas to raise the boy in privacy with the possibility of the boy to be later taught at Professor X\u2019s school for the gifted youngsters. However, when Madrox was still young, Tryp also makes an own offer to look after Jamie, claiming that Jamie was also a \"changeling\" like him.<ref name=\"xfactorv3-11\"/> Jamie's parents, however, refuse to give Jamie to Tryp, who proceeds to create a freak tornado that kills Jamie's parents.\n\nThe all-out conflict between Tryp's Singularity Investigations and X-Factor Investigations began after the youngest version of Tryp badly beat Siryn (after shooting her in the neck with a dart that prevented her from using her powers) and left her for dead.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = David, Peter |Artist = [[Dennis Calero|Calero, Dennis]] | Story = Captive Audience | Title = X-Factor | Volume = 3 | Issue = 5 | Date = May 2006 | Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Siryn, as part of her duties for X-Factor Investigations, was investigating the murder of the woman who died in Jack Vaughn's penthouse under suspicious circumstances. Jack Vaughn (a movie star) claimed that the woman was killed by her sister, Gloria Santiago, who was upset about the relationship (claiming that Jack was \"no good\" for her sister), and that all he was trying to do was wrestle the gun away from her. The sister thus hired X-Factor Investigations to help her clear her name and bring Jack to justice. Singularity Investigations was representing Jack Vaughn with Tryp, Junior (in other words, the youngest version) as the defense counsel. Siryn and X-Factor Investigations managed to incriminate Vaughn and to thwart SI's assassination attempt on Rictor.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = David, Peter| Penciller = Sook, Ryan | Copencillers = Calero, Dennis | Inker = [[Wade Von Grawbadger|Von Grawbadger, Wade]] | Coinkers = Calero, Dennis |Story = Lines in the Sand | Title = X-Factor | Volume = 3 | Issue = 4 | Date = April 2006 | Publisher = Marvel Comics }}</ref> Tryp, Junior is so infuriated by this that he ambushes Siryn and beat her almost to death, leaving her to die in an alley.{{issue|date=November 2013}}\n\nMadrox and Strong Guy give Tryp a very public warning as Tryp is jogging in the park.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = David, Peter| Artist = Calero, Dennis | Story = The Butterfly Defect | Title = X-Factor | Volume = 3 | Issue = 6 | Date = June 2006 | Publisher = Marvel Comics }}</ref> They tell Tryp that they know that it was he who hurt Siryn, and while they will not hurt him in broad daylight, he should watch his back.

X-Factor used this to confront the X-Men with their knowledge of the Decimation. As a result, X-Factor has taken a public stance in defiance of the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]]. However, [[Rictor (comics)|Rictor]] and [[M (Marvel Comics)|M]] were registered by a duplicate of Madrox who is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., and [[Madrox]], [[Strong Guy]], and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] are already registered because of their membership in the previous, government-sponsored X-Factor.

However, once they are alone, Strong Guy kills him and calls Tryp to report this. It is later revealed that Tryp has placed a hypnotic suggestion in Strong Guy's mind to turn him into a [[sleeper agent]]. According to the oldest version of Tryp (ancient), all of Singularity Investigations' efforts to create the Legacy Virus have been to prevent a possible future in which X-Factor manages to undo the Decimation, but as a result, humanity is wiped out by the re-powered mutants in a bloody conflict. As such, X-Factor Investigations' new goal is to undo the Decimation,<ref name=\"x-factorv3-12\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = David, Peter| Artist = [[Arlem, Renato]]| story = untitled | Title = X-Factor|volume=3|issue = 12|date = December 2006|publisher =Marvel Comics}}</ref> but also to prevent the conflict Tryp predicted.{{issue|date=November 2013}}\n\nDue to one of Madrox's dupes blowing up the SI building, apparently killing Tryp, Junior and Tryp, Senior (i.e., the middle-aged version), only the ancient Tryp (the one who has been alive the longest and has seen the grim future) is still alive.<ref name=\"x-factorv3-12\"/>\n\nAfter the destruction of Singularity Investigations, the present form of Damian Tryp (the elder/ancient) reveals to [[Layla Miller (comics)|Layla]] that her very existence had foiled his plans &mdash;  she is a force of chaos like he is.  Tryp also reveals that when he comes into conflict with Layla, terrible events occur as a result.  Following her encounter with Tryp, Layla appears genuinely shocked for the first time: the glass of milk she is pouring overflows, spilling onto the floor.\n\nAfter finding out about the foretold event, each member of the X-Factor Investigations attends a session with [[Doc Samson]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}\n\n===\"World War Hulk\"===\nDuring the \"[[World War Hulk]]\" storyline, X-Factor comes to the aid of [[Professor Xavier]] when the [[Hulk]] seeks retribution on him due to his role within the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}\n\n===Post-\"Civil War\"===\nAfter Madrox's experience with his S.H.I.E.L.D. dupe, a dupe he has forgotten about, Madrox went on a quest to gather his lost dupes and revealed an ability to absorb himself into dupes. This quest met an end when he found a dupe who had built his own family. Meanwhile, Siryn and Monet bonded in France and rescued a child from a riot. X-Factor was then attacked by the X-Cell and almost defeated. The X-Cell's members believed the government to be responsible for their lost powers. All but [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] were repowered by Quicksilver and Rictor\u2014a process that resulted in the death of their [[Elijah Cross|leader]] and [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]], [[Fatale (comics)|Fatale]] and [[Reaper (Marvel Comics)|Reaper]] fleeing into the brimstone dimension to fate unknown.

Layla, however, goes with one of the dupes at the last minute, claiming she has a part to play in their mission. Unfortunately, Forge informs Madrox that there is no way to retrieve Layla and his dupes, who received instructions to kill themselves once they received the information they needed to get reabsorbed into Madrox Prime. Layla and the Madrox-dupe land in Bishop's future, and are captured and held in mutant internment camps. Rictor is instructed to go undercover as a Purifer by pretending to shoot Rahne as she attacked the group's members. He has since gained information on their artillery until his cover was blown by [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] and the other [[New X-Men]]. Rahne later joins the mutant group [[X-Force]] to hunt down Cable using their hyper-keen senses. Siryn was called by the mutant named Peepers asking to help him out.

The agency was originally named ''XXX Investigations'', but team members thought that it sounded too much like Madrox was investigating [[pornography]]. The new name is taken from the government-sponsored mutant supergroup that the three founders had previously served on.\n\n===\"Madrox\" and \"Decimation\"===\nThe initial staff consisted of Madrox's best friend and special enforcer, Guido Carosella ([[Strong Guy]]) and former teammate Rahne Sinclair ([[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]). Following the [[House of M]], Madrox's newfound wealth from winning a ''[[Who Wants to be a Millionaire]]''-style [[game show]] allowed him to recruit several of his former colleagues of the [[Paris]] branch of the now defunct [[X-Corporation]]. New members include [[Siryn]], a powerless [[Rictor]], [[M (Marvel Comics)|M]] and [[Layla Miller]], who has inserted herself into the group to keep them from discovering the truth behind the mutant Decimation, a catastrophic worldwide wiping out of mutant powers that took place during [[Decimation (comics)|a storyline of the same name]].

I note that the award only names me, and I think that\u2019s shortsighted, because there\u2019s been a host of artists and editors along the way who have done a terrific job to bring the stories to the public.  And ultimately I look forward to the day when this award is utterly unnecessary because the positive portrayal of LGBTs is simply so commonplace that it\u2019s no longer newsworthy.

Wolver Hollow would then be unplaced at Kempton before rounding off the season finishing fourth of thirteen starters in the [[Dewhurst Stakes]] behind the next season's English and Irish Derby third Dart Board.\n\n===1967: three-year-old season===\nNewbury would be Wolver Hollow's first port of call in 1967 where he would contest the [[Greenham Stakes]], a traditional trial for the [[2000 Guineas]]. Finishing third by a neck and a head, this was the closest he had come to shedding his maiden tag.

While the contest was effectively a maiden race, Wolver Hollow only had to be shaken up to win by four lengths.<ref>SNOW, JIM. \"Northern Racing.\" Times, August 29, 1967, 11.</ref> Little over a week later, Wolver Hollow doubled his tally with success in the one mile Crathorne Sweepstakes at York.

The first appearance came when fourth in the [[Prix Gontaut-Biron]] won by Frontal - himself fourth in the previous season's [[Prix du Jockey Club]]. On ground considered too soft for him, he was squeezed out of third by a head by Grandier who went on to win a [[Prix d'Ispahan]] and a [[Prix Ganay]] as well as finish third in a [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]].<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Rehearsal for Hopeful Venture.\" Times, 26 Aug. 1968, p. 12.</ref> Nine days later, Wolver Hollow ventured into calmer waters when winning the Prix Ridgway from Right Honourable and Atopolis. <ref>PAR, R.

His reappearance came in the Mark Lane Jubilee Stakes, a ten furlong handicap over ten furlongs on very soft ground. There he faced a stiff task sitting on top of the handicap conceding upwards of seven pounds to winners of the [[Rosebery Stakes]] and the [[City and Suburban Handicap]] along with the previous year's winner.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Wolver Hollow can survive stern test.\" Times, May 10, 1969, 6.</ref> In the event, bottom weight Sovereign Ruler won by a facile eight lengths and would go on to win two and twice finish placed in valuable handicaps through the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=671}}</ref> Wolver Hollow finished runner up while conceding thirty-five pounds to the well handicapped winner and was very much considered a contender going into the [[Lockinge Stakes]] on his next start.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Jimmy Reppin may take Lockinge Stakes.\" Times, 31 May 1969, p. 6.</ref> However, he would finish a tailed off last of six behind [[Habitat (horse)|Habitat]] and subsequently underwent a dope test.<ref>BAERLEIN, RICHARD. \"Lockinge Goes to Habitat.\" The Observer, Jun 01, 1969. P. 21.</ref> Wolver Hollow's penultimate start came at Royal Ascot in the [[Prince of Wales's Stakes]] where he would be ridden by [[Lester Piggot]] for the first time. Here he faced four rivals in the shape of [[Noel Murless|Noel Murless's]] top class [[Connaught (horse)|Connaught]], [[Epsom Derby]] also-ran Stoned and a couple of high class handicappers.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Prince Tenderfoot may be too fast for rivals.\" Times, 17 June 1969, p. 13.</ref> Class told with Connaught making all to win by five lengths ahead of Wolver Hollow, with stoned a further two lengths behind in third.<ref>SNOW, JIM. \"Double for Barclay.\" Times, June 18, 1969, 13.</ref> Wolver Hollow's career would be defined by his final start in the [[Eclipse Stakes]] where he would also be the last horse to carry his owner's colours.<ref name=\"auto1\">BAERLEIN, RICHARD. \"Big Prize for Last Runner.\" The Observer (1901- 2003), Jul 06, 1969, p. 19.</ref> Coughing forced Connaught and Ribofilio (Irish Derby second) to miss their engagement while the useful Remand was withdrawn leaving seven runners to face the starter at Sandown. High class continental form was well represented with Light Wind, who had won that season's [[Premio Presidente della Repubblica]], Hogarth who won the 1968 [[Derby Italiano]] and Timmy My Boy who finished runner up in that year's [[Prix du Jockey Club]]. Royal Rocket was third in the [[Brigadier Gerard Stakes|Coronation Stakes]] while sole three year old runner Rocked finished third in the [[Greenham Stakes]]. Park Top, bidding to become the first mare to win in the race's history, came into the race three from three for the season collecting the Prix de la Seine, the [[Coronation Cup]] and the [[Hardwicke Stakes]] along the way.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=509}}</ref>. Waiting tactics were typically employed on Park Top and controversially, this would be her undoing in the race. As described in Timeform's Racehorses of 1969 \"Wolver Hollow turned for home behind Park Top, came up the rails, gradually made his way to the front after an uninterrupted run, and led throughout the last furlong to win comfortably. Park Top, on the other hand, had several positions in the straight.

His greatest achievement as a stallion came in 1976 when the Henry Cecil trained [[Wollow]] won five top class races, enabling his sire to become the leading sire in the UK and Ireland. Wollow's contribution to this achievement can not be understated. Wolver Hollow earned his accolade with a record of 34 wins from 18 horses amassing \u00a3192,362 in prize money - \u00a3166,389 of which was won by Wollow. Indeed, Wollow's earnings were such that they eclipsed the \u00a3166,323 earned by the progeny of [[Vaguely Noble]], that season's second leading sire.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1977 |title=Racehorses of 1976|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=825}}</ref> Unsurprisingly, this would represent the zenith of Wolver Hollow's stallion career and while he would produce a further handful of useful horses, none of them would win at the highest level. \n\nAs a damsire, Wolver Hollow could not count any European Group One winners among his descendants although Love A Show was victorious in the 1983 [[Blue Diamond Stakes]]. Other horses of note include Reach, winner of the 1984 [[Royal Lodge Stakes]], Festive Cheer, third in the 1991 [[Phoenix Stakes]], Treasure Hope, winner of the 1992 [[Premio Regina Elena]] (Italian 1000 Guineas), and Wrapping, a runner up in the 1989 [[Oaks d'Italia]]. Wolver Hollow was also the damsire of several useful [[National Hunt]] horses such as Simply Dashing, a high class handicap chaser who finished second in a [[Charlie Hall Chase]], 1992 [[Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle]] winner Thetford Forest and useful handicapper Latent Talent. \n\nHe was euthanised due to deteriorating health on 13 June 1987.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pedigreequery.com/wolver+hollow|title=Wolver Hollow Horse Pedigree|website=www.pedigreequery.com}}</ref>\n\n===Notable progeny===\n\n''c = [[colt (horse)|colt]], f = [[filly]], g = [[gelding]]''\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" font-size:80%\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| '''Foaled'''\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| '''Name'''\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| '''Dam'''\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| '''Sex'''\n| style=\"width:510px;\"| '''Major Wins and Notable Performances'''\n|-\n| 1971\n| Charlie Bubbles\n| Sixandahalf\n| c\n| 1st [[Hardwicke Stakes]] (1975)\n|-\n|-\n| 1971\n| [[Furry Glen]]\n| Cleftess\n| c\n| 1st [[Marble Hill Stakes]] (1973) 1st [[Leopardstown Stakes|Mullion Stakes]] (1973) 1st [[Irish 2000 Guineas]] (1974) 1st [[International Stakes (Ireland)|Whitehall Stakes]] (1974) 2nd [[Vauxhall Trial Stakes]] (1974) 2nd [[Gallinule Stakes]] (1974) 3rd [[Coventry Stakes]] (1973) 3rd Larkspur Stakes (1973) \n|-\n|-\n| 1971\n| Wanlockhead\n| Exultation\n| c\n| 3rd [[Gordon Richards Stakes|Westbury Stakes]] (1975)\n|-\n|-\n| 1973\n| [[Wollow]]\n| Wichuraiana\n| c\n| 1st [[Champagne Stakes (Great Britain)|Champagne Stakes]] (1975) 1st [[Dewhurst Stakes]] (1975) 1st [[Greenham Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[2000 Guineas]] (1976) 1st [[Eclipse Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[Sussex Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[International Stakes|Benson & Hedges Gold Cup]] (1976)\n|-\n|-\n| 1973\n| Wolverlife\n| Miralife\n| c\n| 3rd [[Duke of York Stakes]] (1977) 3rd [[Palace House Stakes]] (1977) 3rd [[Diamond Jubilee Stakes|Cork and Orrery Stakes]]\n|-\n|-\n| 1975\n| My Hollow\n| Saucy Mine\n| f\n| 1st [[Royal Whip Stakes]] (1980) 1st [[Desmond Stakes]] (1980) 2nd [[Blandford Stakes]] (1980)\n|-\n|-\n| 1976\n| Galaxy Libra\n| Garden of Eden\n| c\n| 1st [[Man o' War Stakes]] (1981) 2nd [[Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational Stakes]] (1981) 3rd [[Charles Whittingham Stakes|Hollywood Invitational Handicap]] (1981) 3rd [[Washington, D.C.

He would achieve greater success as a stallion whereupon retiring to stud where he became [[Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland|Champion Sire]] in Britain.\n\n==Background==\n\nBy Sovereign Path and out of Cygnet, Wolver Hollow was sold as a yearling, fetching 4,000 guineas<ref>SNOW,, JIM. \"Wolver Hollow shows his class.\" Times, September 8, 1967, 14.

High class continental form was well represented with Light Wind, who had won that season's [[Premio Presidente della Repubblica]], Hogarth who won the 1968 [[Derby Italiano]] and Timmy My Boy who finished runner up in that year's [[Prix du Jockey Club]]. Royal Rocket was third in the [[Brigadier Gerard Stakes|Coronation Stakes]] while sole three year old runner Rocked finished third in the [[Greenham Stakes]]. Park Top, bidding to become the first mare to win in the race's history, came into the race three from three for the season collecting the Prix de la Seine, the [[Coronation Cup]] and the [[Hardwicke Stakes]] along the way.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=509}}</ref>. Waiting tactics were typically employed on Park Top and controversially, this would be her undoing in the race. As described in Timeform's Racehorses of 1969 \"Wolver Hollow turned for home behind Park Top, came up the rails, gradually made his way to the front after an uninterrupted run, and led throughout the last furlong to win comfortably. Park Top, on the other hand, had several positions in the straight. She ran into the heels of the pacemaking Rocked two furlongs out, and after making her way round that horse she found her way blocked by the Italian Derby winner Hogarth. By the time she had moved out to come round Hogarth on the wide outside she had no chance of catching Wolver Hollow: she had used up most of her energy finding a way through, and courage wasn't enough to win her the prize.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=510}}</ref> Park Top would win the [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]] next time under Lester Piggot, confirming that she was superior to her Sandown showing. Nevertheless, Wolver Hollow's win was enough to secure a new career as a stallion.\n\n==Races==\n\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\" text-align:centre; margin-left:1em; float:centre ;border-collapse: collapse; font-size:100%\"\n|-  style=\"background:#dacaa4; text-align:center;\"\n!'''Date'''\n!'''Finish'''\n!'''Race'''\n!'''Dist'''\n!'''Jockey'''\n!'''Winner/Runner up '''\n!'''Track'''\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|06|16}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Norfolk Stakes (Great Britain)|New Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">5</span>5f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Falcon\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|07|20}}\t\n|4th\n|[[National_Stakes_(Sandown_Park)|National Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">5</span>5f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Falcon\n|[[Sandown Park Racecourse|Sandown Park]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|09|17}}\t\n|Unplaced\n|Imperial Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">6</span>6f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Heath Rose\n|[[Kempton_Park_Racecourse|Kempton Park]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|10|14}}\t\n|4th\n|[[Dewhurst Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">7</span>7f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Dart Board\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|04|22}}\t\n|3rd\n|[[Greenham Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">7</span>7f\n|[[Doug Smith (jockey)|Doug Smith]]\n|Play High\n|[[Newbury_Racecourse|Newbury]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|05|03}}\t\n|Unplaced\n|[[2000 Guineas Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[Doug Smith  (jockey)|Doug Smith ]]\n|[[Royal_Palace_(horse)|Royal Palace]]\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|06|20}}\t\n|4th\n|[[St James's Palace Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[George Moore (jockey)|George Moore]]\n|[[Reform (horse)|Reform]]\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|07|28}}\t\n|5th\n|News of the World Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|Jimmy Lindley\n|Sucaryl\n|[[Goodwood Racecourse|Goodwood]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|08|28}}\t\n|1st\n|Virginia Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Edward Hide]]\n|Future Fame\n|[[Newcastle Racecourse|Newcastle]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|09|07}}\t\n|1st\n|Crathorne Sweepstakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[Edward Hide]]\n|Scottish Sinbad\n|[[York Racecourse|York]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|09|16}}\t\n|3rd\n|Wavertree Sweepstakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Doug Smith (jockey)|Doug Smith]]\n|Fair Winter\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|10|21}}\t\n|3rd\n|[[Cambridgeshire Handicap]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">9</span>1m1f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Lacquer\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|8|17}}\t\n|4th\n|[[Prix Gontaut-Biron]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Frontal\n|[[Deauville-La Touques Racecourse|Deauville]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|8|26}}\t\n|1st\n|Prix Ridgway\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Right Honourable\n|[[Deauville-La Touques Racecourse|Deauville]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|9|28}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Queen Elizabeth II Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|World Cup\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|10|19}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Cambridgeshire Handicap]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">9</span>1m1f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Emerilo\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|5|10}}\t\n|2nd\n|Jubilee Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|Jimmy Lindley\n|Sovereign Ruler\n|[[Kempton_Park_Racecourse|Kempton Park]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|5|31}}\t\n|6th\n|[[Lockinge Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|Jimmy Lindley\n|[[Habitat (horse)|Habitat]]\n|[[Newbury_Racecourse|Newbury]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|6|17}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Prince of Wales's Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Lester Piggott]]\n|[[Connaught (horse)|Connaught]]\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|7|5}}\t\n|1st\n|[[Eclipse Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Lester Piggott]]\n|[[Park Top]]\n|[[Sandown Park Racecourse|Sandown Park]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Stud career==\nWhen owner [[Hope Goddard Iselin]] retired at the age of 102, the horses she still had in training were sent to be sold at Newmarket. The one exception was Wolver Hollow who was given to his former trainer [[Cecil Boyd-Rochfort]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> On Wolver Hollow's retirement, he was syndicated by the Curragh Bloodstock Agency and initially stood at Athgarvan Stud, The Curragh.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=999}}</ref> Through a friendship between Boyd-Rochfort and Billy Iceton, Wolver Hollow spent his latter breeding career at Tara Stud in County Meath.<ref>Griffiths, Richard. \"Tributes paid after death of renowned stud master Billy Iceton, aged 81.\" Racing Post, May 20, 2010: 17.</ref> Wolver Hollow enjoyed success with his first crop, spearheaded by the classic winning [[Furry Glen]]. His greatest achievement as a stallion came in 1976 when the Henry Cecil trained [[Wollow]] won five top class races, enabling his sire to become the leading sire in the UK and Ireland. Wollow's contribution to this achievement can not be understated. Wolver Hollow earned his accolade with a record of 34 wins from 18 horses amassing \u00a3192,362 in prize money - \u00a3166,389 of which was won by Wollow. Indeed, Wollow's earnings were such that they eclipsed the \u00a3166,323 earned by the progeny of [[Vaguely Noble]], that season's second leading sire.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1977 |title=Racehorses of 1976|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=825}}</ref> Unsurprisingly, this would represent the zenith of Wolver Hollow's stallion career and while he would produce a further handful of useful horses, none of them would win at the highest level. \n\nAs a damsire, Wolver Hollow could not count any European Group One winners among his descendants although Love A Show was victorious in the 1983 [[Blue Diamond Stakes]]. Other horses of note include Reach, winner of the 1984 [[Royal Lodge Stakes]], Festive Cheer, third in the 1991 [[Phoenix Stakes]], Treasure Hope, winner of the 1992 [[Premio Regina Elena]] (Italian 1000 Guineas), and Wrapping, a runner up in the 1989 [[Oaks d'Italia]]. Wolver Hollow was also the damsire of several useful [[National Hunt]] horses such as Simply Dashing, a high class handicap chaser who finished second in a [[Charlie Hall Chase]], 1992 [[Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle]] winner Thetford Forest and useful handicapper Latent Talent. \n\nHe was euthanised due to deteriorating health on 13 June 1987.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pedigreequery.com/wolver+hollow|title=Wolver Hollow Horse Pedigree|website=www.pedigreequery.com}}</ref>\n\n===Notable progeny===\n\n''c = [[colt (horse)|colt]], f = [[filly]], g = [[gelding]]''\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" font-size:80%\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| '''Foaled'''\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| '''Name'''\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| '''Dam'''\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| '''Sex'''\n| style=\"width:510px;\"| '''Major Wins and Notable Performances'''\n|-\n| 1971\n| Charlie Bubbles\n| Sixandahalf\n| c\n| 1st [[Hardwicke Stakes]] (1975)\n|-\n|-\n| 1971\n| [[Furry Glen]]\n| Cleftess\n| c\n| 1st [[Marble Hill Stakes]] (1973) 1st [[Leopardstown Stakes|Mullion Stakes]] (1973) 1st [[Irish 2000 Guineas]] (1974) 1st [[International Stakes (Ireland)|Whitehall Stakes]] (1974) 2nd [[Vauxhall Trial Stakes]] (1974) 2nd [[Gallinule Stakes]] (1974) 3rd [[Coventry Stakes]] (1973) 3rd Larkspur Stakes (1973) \n|-\n|-\n| 1971\n| Wanlockhead\n| Exultation\n| c\n| 3rd [[Gordon Richards Stakes|Westbury Stakes]] (1975)\n|-\n|-\n| 1973\n| [[Wollow]]\n| Wichuraiana\n| c\n| 1st [[Champagne Stakes (Great Britain)|Champagne Stakes]] (1975) 1st [[Dewhurst Stakes]] (1975) 1st [[Greenham Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[2000 Guineas]] (1976) 1st [[Eclipse Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[Sussex Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[International Stakes|Benson & Hedges Gold Cup]] (1976)\n|-\n|-\n| 1973\n| Wolverlife\n| Miralife\n| c\n| 3rd [[Duke of York Stakes]] (1977) 3rd [[Palace House Stakes]] (1977) 3rd [[Diamond Jubilee Stakes|Cork and Orrery Stakes]]\n|-\n|-\n| 1975\n| My Hollow\n| Saucy Mine\n| f\n| 1st [[Royal Whip Stakes]] (1980) 1st [[Desmond Stakes]] (1980) 2nd [[Blandford Stakes]] (1980)\n|-\n|-\n| 1976\n| Galaxy Libra\n| Garden of Eden\n| c\n| 1st [[Man o' War Stakes]] (1981) 2nd [[Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational Stakes]] (1981) 3rd [[Charles Whittingham Stakes|Hollywood Invitational Handicap]] (1981) 3rd [[Washington, D.C.

It ran in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men (vol. 2)]]'', ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', and ''[[X-Force]]'', and featured [[Stryfe]] as the central villain. The story was heavily hyped as revealing the origin of popular ''X-Force'' star [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], but ultimately Cable's origin was not covered in any of the installments.\n\nThe main issues of the crossover were sold polybagged with a special trading card that featured Stryfe's personal views of key characters from the crossover. Because of this, the issues themselves were priced at $1.50, twenty-five cents more than their normal price of $1.25.\n\n==Plot==\nMutant pop-star [[Lila Cheney]] organizes a free concert in [[Central Park]] to promote diversity in society and invites [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] to speak at the concert. His speech is interrupted by [[Stryfe]] who, disguised as his doppelganger and nemesis [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], shoots Xavier with a bullet that infects the professor with a lethal strain of the [[Techno-organic virus]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[War (Marvel Comics character)#Abraham Kieros|War]] and [[Famine (comics)|Famine]], the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]], attack [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], distracting them from [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], who kidnaps [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]]. The Horsemen are working for [[Mr. Sinister]], who is impersonating the Horsemen's former master [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Mr. Sinister organized the kidnapping as part of his newly formed alliance with Stryfe. Stryfe trades Mr. Sinister a canister containing the past and future Summers family DNA history, and receives Jean Grey and Cyclops in the exchange.\n\nWhile Xavier is rushed to the hospital, X-Factor and the Blue X-Men strike team go after [[X-Force]], Cable's team of mutants. X-Force, however, is in the dark about Cable's current location (having been separated from him during a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]-organized raid of their headquarters). But mutual distrust causes the two groups to attack and ultimately capture X-Force. Meanwhile, Mr. Sinister doublecrosses Stryfe by revealing to the X-Men that Stryfe, under the guise of Cable, was the shooter.\n\nWhile the Blue X-Men strike team, X-Factor, [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] go after the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s Gold X-Men strike team, along with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], confront Apocalypse over Scott and Jean's kidnapping, hoping as well to gain a cure for the virus that is threatening Xavier's life. Apocalypse is incredibly weak, having been nearly killed by Cyclops in their previous encounter and prematurely awoken from his regeneration chamber by his minions the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]. After learning from the Dark Riders that someone had been impersonating him, and ordered his old minions to kidnap Jean and Scott, Apocalypse barely escapes with his life. [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] finds himself becoming more and more consumed with punishing Apocalypse for his crimes, most notably Apocalypse's converting Archangel into the blue-skinned, metal winged angel of death.\n\nThe Mutant Liberation Front is defeated, though at the cost of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] being blinded by MLF member [[Strobe (comics)|Strobe]]. Meanwhile, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] locate Cable and after a brawl, decide to give him the benefit of the doubt and work together to find Jean and Scott.\n\nApocalypse is ambushed by [[Stryfe]], who declares that he is out for revenge for unknown wrongs committed against him as a child by Apocalypse. After Stryfe stabs him in the chest, Apocalypse escapes and seeks refuge amongst the X-Men, ultimately curing Xavier of the [[techno-organic virus]] as payment for [[sanctuary]].\n\nCyclops and Jean are systematically tortured by Stryfe, who blames the two mutants for ruining his life, a claim that leaves the two X-Men stunned since they never encountered Stryfe before their kidnapping. Stryfe and his new minions the Dark Riders, who pledge their allegiance to Stryfe after he defeats Apocalypse, move the two to Apocalypse's former base on the Moon. Scott and Jean escape, entering the vacuum before realizing they are not on Earth. Her powers no longer blocked, Jean sends a frantic SOS to Wolverine.\n\nThe X-Men, knowing Xavier will live now that Apocalypse has purged the techno-virus from him, head into space to save their teammates. Cable, Wolverine, and Bishop head out to Stryfe's base on the Moon too and arrive there first, decimating Stryfe's defenses just as the X-Men ([[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Psylocke]], [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], Cannonball, [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], Iceman and Archangel) and Apocalypse arrive. Splitting up, Apocalypse is ambushed by the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], who beat their former master to the brink of death. Apocalypse is later confronted by Archangel who refuses Apocalypse's request for a mercy killing.\n\nUpon catching Jean and Scott Summers outside the moonbase, Stryfe takes them to a giant time portal he had constructed on the Moon. As [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Cannonball, Havok and Polaris make their way to the tower, a forcefield is activated that prevents any without the Summers DNA from approaching the tower just as Stryfe activated the tower's time portal technology. Stryfe planned this so he could confront Cable alone, and though Havok has enough genetic similarity to Scott to pass through the forcefield, doing so renders him unconscious. Cable finds himself hopelessly outmatched by Stryfe, but as they battle, Jean Grey and Cyclops break free and Havok regains consciousness. Driven to despair, Stryfe tries to collapse the active tower upon the X-Men. Cable grabs Stryfe and orders Cyclops to activate the time vortex, a plan that would kill both Stryfe and Cable. Cyclops reluctantly does so; both men are sucked into a massive vortex that is created as the tower explodes. Cyclops and Jean Grey begin to suspect that either Stryfe or Cable is Cyclops' son Nathan Christopher Summers, who Cyclops was forced to abandon and send into the future after Apocalypse infected him with a techno-virus.\n\n[[Mr. Sinister]] has a minion, Gordan, open the canister given to him by Stryfe, only to find it apparently empty. Though not revealed in ''X-Cutioner's Song'', the canister in fact contained the [[Legacy Virus]].\n\nOf note, in X-men issue #303 Illyana Rasputina the sister of colossus died of the Legacy virus promoting him to eventually leave the X-men and join Magento for a time\n===Epilogue===\nProfessor X discovers that the techno-organic virus has left him temporarily capable of walking and spends his few hours without paralysis bonding with [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] hang out together as Rogue agrees to let Gambit be her \"eyes\" until she regains her sight, laying the groundwork for the two finally becoming a couple. Archangel and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] rebuild the bar that Cyclops and Jean Grey were kidnapped in and think back to their days as the original X-Men.\n\n==''Stryfe's Strike File''==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stryfesf.jpg|Cover to ''Stryfe's Strike File'' #1. Art by Andy Kubert.|thumb|200px]] -->\n''Stryfe's Strike File'' was the name of a 1993 ''[[X-Men]]'' one-shot written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Scott Lobdell]]. It included several years worth of foreshadowing of Lobdell and Nicieza's X-Men plotlines, most notably the Legacy Virus plotline. The comic framing device was that the files in the one-shot were on a CD-ROM found at Stryfe's base by Bishop and handed over to Xavier without telling anyone else about it. After nearly two dozen pages of text and picture files, most of which were taken from the trading card inserts included in the individual issues of the crossover, the book ended with a closing sequence where Xavier destroys the disk rather than showing it to Cyclops and Jean Grey.\n\nThe book contained entries for [[Graydon Creed]], [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]], and [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]] prior to their first appearances elsewhere. Graydon Creed would appear as a villain two months later, Threnody would appear eleven months later, yet Holocaust would not appear in the [[X-Men]] comics until the alternate reality ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' storyline. The version found in that storyline differs from the one found in Stryfe's Strike File in that the Age of Apocalypse Holocaust requires a containment suit and is very talkative while the Holocaust in the files does not need a containment suit and is a silent killer.\n\n==Publication==\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #294\n#''X-Factor'' #84\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #14\n#''X-Force'' #16\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #295\n#''X-Factor'' #85\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #15\n#''X-Force'' #17\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #296\n#''X-Factor'' #86\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #16\n#''X-Force'' #18\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #297 (Epilogue)\n#''X-Force'' #19 (Epilogue)\n# \"Stryfe's Strike File\"\n\n===Collected editions===\nThe storyline (except for \"Epilogues 1 & 2 \" & \"Stryfe's Strike File\") have been collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (May 1994, {{ISBN|0-7851-0025-3}})\n\nIt has also been collected into a hardcover:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (368 pages, October 19, 2011, {{ISBN|0785156100}}) \nCollects Uncanny X-Men #294-297, X-Factor #84-86, X-Men #14-16, X-Force #16-19 and Stryfe's Strike File\n\n==Publication history==\nIn 1991, the X-Men franchise had reached a popularity level unheard of at the time, with the release of the high selling ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #1 and ''X-Force'' #1, as well as the contributions of popular artists [[Jim Lee]], [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Whilce Portacio]] to the main X-Men books. But by 1992, Portacio, Lee and Liefeld left Marvel Comics to form their own comic company [[Image Comics]], alongside several other high profile Marvel artists. New writers and artists were quickly drafted to replace the departing fan favorite artists, most notably writers [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist [[Greg Capullo]].\n\nAt a writer's retreat held by the X-Men writing staff in 1992, the writers began to plan which direction for the X-Men. A massive crossover had been decided upon prior to the formation of Image Comics and it was decided by the new writers to continue with the plan as a means to keep attention on the X-Men books at the time. The subject of the crossover was having the X-Men face their biggest enemies at the time, Stryfe, Apocalypse, and Mr. Sinister, and revealing the origin of the popular X-Force leader Cable.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nA year earlier it was heavily implied that Cable was Nathan Christopher Summers, the infant son of X-Man Cyclops and Madelyne Prior.<ref>[[Simonson, Louise]] (w).

Excluding the \"Age of Apocalypse\" storyline, Apocalypse would return in ''Cable'' #19, while Stryfe would return as a ghost who possessed Cable.

Stryfe had earlier given [[Mister Sinister]] a canister that he claimed contained two thousand years worth of genetic material from the Summers bloodline. When Sinister opened it after Stryfe was apparently killed by Cable, he found nothing inside. The canister actually contained a plague, Stryfe's \"Legacy\" to the world. The virus, presumably from the future, was 100% fatal and struck only mutants but later infected the human doctor and long-time X-Men ally, [[Moira MacTaggert]]. MacTaggert would ultimately develop a cure just before her death, though it would cost the mutant Peter Rasputin ([[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]) his life, due to the cure requiring a mutant to die in order to activate it.\n\n==In other media==\nThe 1995 video game ''[[X-Men: Gamesmaster's Legacy]]'' is loosely based on the events of \"X-Cutioner's Song\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Executioner's Song]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060717234705/http://www.mutanthigh.com/xcutionerssong.html X-Cutioners Song X-Over issue-by-issue synopsis]\n*{{comicbookdb|type=storyarc|id=125|title=X-Cutioner's Song}}\n\n{{X-Comics}}\n\n[[Category:Comics by Fabian Nicieza]]\n[[Category:Comics by Peter David]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{About|the Marvel Comics crossover series ''X-Cutioner's Song''|the supervillain|X-Cutioner}}\n{{Infobox comics story arc <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|title          = X-Cutioner's Song\n|image          = X-Cutioner's Song Cover.jpg\n|imagesize      = <!-- default 250 -->\n|caption        = {{Descript-cvr|X-Cutioner's Song|||1994|type=TPB}}Art by [[Jae Lee]].\n|publisher      = [[Marvel Comics]]\n|startmo        = November\n|startyr        = 1992\n|endmo          = February\n|endyr          = 1993\n|Crossover      = y\n|titles         = ''[[#Stryfe's Strike File|Stryfe's Strike File]] #1''<br><!--\n-->''[[Uncanny X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #294-297<br /><!--\n-->''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' vol. 1, #84-86<br /><!--\n-->''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' vol. 2, #14-16<br /><!--\n-->''[[X-Force]]'' vol. 1, #16-19<br /><!--\n-->Cable - Blood and Metal #1-2<br /><!--\n-->What If? #69\n|main_char_team = [[X-Men]]<br/>[[X-Force]]<br/>[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]<br/>[[Mutant Liberation Front]]<br/>[[Stryfe]]\n|writers        = [[Scott Lobdell]], [[Fabian Nicieza]], [[Peter David]]\n|artists        =\n|pencillers     = [[Brandon Peterson]], [[Andy Kubert]], [[Jae Lee]], [[Greg Capullo]]\n|inkers         = [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]], [[Mark Pennington (comics)|Mark Pennington]], [[Al Milgrom]], [[Harry Candelario]]\n|letterers      =\n|editors        =\n|colorists      = Mike Thomas, [[Marie Javins]], Glynis Oliver, Joe Rosas, Steve Buccellato\n|TPB            = X-cutioners Song\n|ISBN           = 0-7851-0025-3\n|cat            = X-Men\n|sortkey        = X-Cutioner's Song\n}}\n\"'''X-Cutioner's Song'''\" is a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline published by [[Marvel Comics]]' in twelve parts from November 1992 to early 1993. It ran in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men (vol. 2)]]'', ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', and ''[[X-Force]]'', and featured [[Stryfe]] as the central villain. The story was heavily hyped as revealing the origin of popular ''X-Force'' star [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], but ultimately Cable's origin was not covered in any of the installments.\n\nThe main issues of the crossover were sold polybagged with a special trading card that featured Stryfe's personal views of key characters from the crossover. Because of this, the issues themselves were priced at $1.50, twenty-five cents more than their normal price of $1.25.\n\n==Plot==\nMutant pop-star [[Lila Cheney]] organizes a free concert in [[Central Park]] to promote diversity in society and invites [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] to speak at the concert. His speech is interrupted by [[Stryfe]] who, disguised as his doppelganger and nemesis [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], shoots Xavier with a bullet that infects the professor with a lethal strain of the [[Techno-organic virus]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[War (Marvel Comics character)#Abraham Kieros|War]] and [[Famine (comics)|Famine]], the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]], attack [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], distracting them from [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], who kidnaps [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]]. The Horsemen are working for [[Mr. Sinister]], who is impersonating the Horsemen's former master [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Mr. Sinister organized the kidnapping as part of his newly formed alliance with Stryfe. Stryfe trades Mr. Sinister a canister containing the past and future Summers family DNA history, and receives Jean Grey and Cyclops in the exchange.\n\nWhile Xavier is rushed to the hospital, X-Factor and the Blue X-Men strike team go after [[X-Force]], Cable's team of mutants. X-Force, however, is in the dark about Cable's current location (having been separated from him during a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]-organized raid of their headquarters). But mutual distrust causes the two groups to attack and ultimately capture X-Force. Meanwhile, Mr. Sinister doublecrosses Stryfe by revealing to the X-Men that Stryfe, under the guise of Cable, was the shooter.\n\nWhile the Blue X-Men strike team, X-Factor, [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] go after the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s Gold X-Men strike team, along with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], confront Apocalypse over Scott and Jean's kidnapping, hoping as well to gain a cure for the virus that is threatening Xavier's life. Apocalypse is incredibly weak, having been nearly killed by Cyclops in their previous encounter and prematurely awoken from his regeneration chamber by his minions the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]. After learning from the Dark Riders that someone had been impersonating him, and ordered his old minions to kidnap Jean and Scott, Apocalypse barely escapes with his life. [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] finds himself becoming more and more consumed with punishing Apocalypse for his crimes, most notably Apocalypse's converting Archangel into the blue-skinned, metal winged angel of death.\n\nThe Mutant Liberation Front is defeated, though at the cost of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] being blinded by MLF member [[Strobe (comics)|Strobe]]. Meanwhile, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] locate Cable and after a brawl, decide to give him the benefit of the doubt and work together to find Jean and Scott.\n\nApocalypse is ambushed by [[Stryfe]], who declares that he is out for revenge for unknown wrongs committed against him as a child by Apocalypse. After Stryfe stabs him in the chest, Apocalypse escapes and seeks refuge amongst the X-Men, ultimately curing Xavier of the [[techno-organic virus]] as payment for [[sanctuary]].\n\nCyclops and Jean are systematically tortured by Stryfe, who blames the two mutants for ruining his life, a claim that leaves the two X-Men stunned since they never encountered Stryfe before their kidnapping. Stryfe and his new minions the Dark Riders, who pledge their allegiance to Stryfe after he defeats Apocalypse, move the two to Apocalypse's former base on the Moon. Scott and Jean escape, entering the vacuum before realizing they are not on Earth. Her powers no longer blocked, Jean sends a frantic SOS to Wolverine.\n\nThe X-Men, knowing Xavier will live now that Apocalypse has purged the techno-virus from him, head into space to save their teammates. Cable, Wolverine, and Bishop head out to Stryfe's base on the Moon too and arrive there first, decimating Stryfe's defenses just as the X-Men ([[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Psylocke]], [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], Cannonball, [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], Iceman and Archangel) and Apocalypse arrive. Splitting up, Apocalypse is ambushed by the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], who beat their former master to the brink of death. Apocalypse is later confronted by Archangel who refuses Apocalypse's request for a mercy killing.\n\nUpon catching Jean and Scott Summers outside the moonbase, Stryfe takes them to a giant time portal he had constructed on the Moon. As [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Cannonball, Havok and Polaris make their way to the tower, a forcefield is activated that prevents any without the Summers DNA from approaching the tower just as Stryfe activated the tower's time portal technology. Stryfe planned this so he could confront Cable alone, and though Havok has enough genetic similarity to Scott to pass through the forcefield, doing so renders him unconscious. Cable finds himself hopelessly outmatched by Stryfe, but as they battle, Jean Grey and Cyclops break free and Havok regains consciousness. Driven to despair, Stryfe tries to collapse the active tower upon the X-Men. Cable grabs Stryfe and orders Cyclops to activate the time vortex, a plan that would kill both Stryfe and Cable. Cyclops reluctantly does so; both men are sucked into a massive vortex that is created as the tower explodes. Cyclops and Jean Grey begin to suspect that either Stryfe or Cable is Cyclops' son Nathan Christopher Summers, who Cyclops was forced to abandon and send into the future after Apocalypse infected him with a techno-virus.\n\n[[Mr. Sinister]] has a minion, Gordan, open the canister given to him by Stryfe, only to find it apparently empty. Though not revealed in ''X-Cutioner's Song'', the canister in fact contained the [[Legacy Virus]].\n\nOf note, in X-men issue #303 Illyana Rasputina the sister of colossus died of the Legacy virus promoting him to eventually leave the X-men and join Magento for a time\n===Epilogue===\nProfessor X discovers that the techno-organic virus has left him temporarily capable of walking and spends his few hours without paralysis bonding with [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] hang out together as Rogue agrees to let Gambit be her \"eyes\" until she regains her sight, laying the groundwork for the two finally becoming a couple. Archangel and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] rebuild the bar that Cyclops and Jean Grey were kidnapped in and think back to their days as the original X-Men.\n\n==''Stryfe's Strike File''==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stryfesf.jpg|Cover to ''Stryfe's Strike File'' #1. Art by Andy Kubert.|thumb|200px]] -->\n''Stryfe's Strike File'' was the name of a 1993 ''[[X-Men]]'' one-shot written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Scott Lobdell]]. It included several years worth of foreshadowing of Lobdell and Nicieza's X-Men plotlines, most notably the Legacy Virus plotline. The comic framing device was that the files in the one-shot were on a CD-ROM found at Stryfe's base by Bishop and handed over to Xavier without telling anyone else about it. After nearly two dozen pages of text and picture files, most of which were taken from the trading card inserts included in the individual issues of the crossover, the book ended with a closing sequence where Xavier destroys the disk rather than showing it to Cyclops and Jean Grey.\n\nThe book contained entries for [[Graydon Creed]], [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]], and [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]] prior to their first appearances elsewhere. Graydon Creed would appear as a villain two months later, Threnody would appear eleven months later, yet Holocaust would not appear in the [[X-Men]] comics until the alternate reality ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' storyline. The version found in that storyline differs from the one found in Stryfe's Strike File in that the Age of Apocalypse Holocaust requires a containment suit and is very talkative while the Holocaust in the files does not need a containment suit and is a silent killer.\n\n==Publication==\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #294\n#''X-Factor'' #84\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #14\n#''X-Force'' #16\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #295\n#''X-Factor'' #85\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #15\n#''X-Force'' #17\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #296\n#''X-Factor'' #86\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #16\n#''X-Force'' #18\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #297 (Epilogue)\n#''X-Force'' #19 (Epilogue)\n# \"Stryfe's Strike File\"\n\n===Collected editions===\nThe storyline (except for \"Epilogues 1 & 2 \" & \"Stryfe's Strike File\") have been collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (May 1994, {{ISBN|0-7851-0025-3}})\n\nIt has also been collected into a hardcover:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (368 pages, October 19, 2011, {{ISBN|0785156100}}) \nCollects Uncanny X-Men #294-297, X-Factor #84-86, X-Men #14-16, X-Force #16-19 and Stryfe's Strike File\n\n==Publication history==\nIn 1991, the X-Men franchise had reached a popularity level unheard of at the time, with the release of the high selling ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #1 and ''X-Force'' #1, as well as the contributions of popular artists [[Jim Lee]], [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Whilce Portacio]] to the main X-Men books.

Ideally, the design and fabrication of the bridge is conceived and completed entirely by the students and the participation of the students in the process is highly encouraged. Some schools may not have the proper facilities and guidance necessary to erect the model bridge and may work with a commercial fabricator. However, the students must be fully responsible for the design and instructions, they must coordinate with the fabricator, and they must monitor the construction process.\n\nThe bridges must follow specifications explained in the rule book. The rules of the competition are changed annually to further enhance the quality of the competition and to prevent the submission of an already existing bridge.\n\nThe competition gets additional sponsorship from the [[American Iron and Steel Institute]], the National Steel Bridge Alliance, [[Nucor Corporation]], and The James F. Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation.<ref>[http://www.aisc.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Learning_Opportunities/University_Programs/Student_Competitions1/AISC_Student_Steel_Bridge_Competition/AISC_Student_Steel_Bridge_Competition.htm AISC | AISC Student Steel Bridge Competition<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe steel bridge competition, in its embryonic form, began as a miniature bridge design competition using balsa wood to see which competitor's bridge is the best.

Shaw Jr.], Associate Director of Education for the American Institute of Steel Construction, initiated the steel bridge competition in the spring of 1987 and was honored by the AISC in 2000 for his achievement. The first teams to compete were [[Lawrence Technological University]](who hosted the competition), [[Wayne State University]], and [[Michigan Technological University]].<ref>Shaw, Robert \"Bridging the Gap: From Classroom Learning to Hands-On Experience\". http://steelstructures.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bridging-the-Gap-Classroom-Learning-to-Hands-On-Experience.pdf</ref> In 1988, the competition grew to four regional conference competitions: North Central at the [[University of Detroit]], Great Lakes at [[Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology]], Carolinas at the [[University of North Carolina - Charlotte]], and Ohio Valley at the [[University of Louisville]].

Ideally, the design and fabrication of the bridge is conceived and completed entirely by the students and the participation of the students in the process is highly encouraged. Some schools may not have the proper facilities and guidance necessary to erect the model bridge and may work with a commercial fabricator. However, the students must be fully responsible for the design and instructions, they must coordinate with the fabricator, and they must monitor the construction process.\n\nThe bridges must follow specifications explained in the rule book. The rules of the competition are changed annually to further enhance the quality of the competition and to prevent the submission of an already existing bridge.\n\nThe competition gets additional sponsorship froom the [[American Iron and Steel Institute]], the National Steel Bridge Alliance, [[Nucor Corporation]], and The James F. Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation.<ref>[http://www.aisc.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Learning_Opportunities/University_Programs/Student_Competitions1/AISC_Student_Steel_Bridge_Competition/AISC_Student_Steel_Bridge_Competition.htm AISC | AISC Student Steel Bridge Competition<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe steel bridge competition, in its embryonic form, began as a miniature bridge design competition using balsa wood to see which competitor's bridge is the best.
