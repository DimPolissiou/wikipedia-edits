In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Characteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref> ILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood.

They eliminate hepatic cells in fibrotic liver via [[TRAIL]] and/or [[NKG2D]].\n\nILCs play an important role in maintaining dietary stress, and metabolic homeostasis. The production of [[tryptophan]] metabolites causes the [[Aryl hydrocarbon receptor|AhR transcription factor]] to induce IL-22 expression, maintaining the number of ILC3s present, and therefore intestinal homeostasis. <ref name=\"VivierArtis2018\"/> The vitamin A metabolite, retinoic acid, also upregulates the expression of IL-22, and therefore, the absence of the AhR signalling pathway, and of retinoic acid, results in reduced immunity to bacterial infections, such as [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] ''[[Citrobacter rodentium]]'' infection.<ref name=\"VivierArtis2018\"/> Retinoic acid also enhances the expression of gut- homing markers on ILC1s, and ILC3s. Dietary nutrient availability therefore modifies the ILC immune response to infection and inflammation, highlighting the importance of a balanced and healthy diet.\n\nILC2s support a type- 2 immune environment in the [[adipose tissue]], via the production of IL-5, IL-4 and IL-13. This regulates adiposity, insulin resistance, and caloric expenditure.<ref name=\"VivierArtis2018\"/> Dysregulation of this causes persistent type 1 inflammation, leading to [[obesity]]. ILC2s promote the beiging of adipocytes, and therefore increased energy expenditure. Therefore, decreased responses of ILC2s in the tissue are a characteristic of obesity, as this interrupts their crucial role in energy homeostasis, resulting in reduced energy expenditure and increased adiposity. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Brestoff|first=Jonathan R.|last2=Kim|first2=Brian S.|last3=Saenz|first3=Steven A.|last4=Stine|first4=Rachel R.|last5=Monticelli|first5=Laurel A.|last6=Sonnenberg|first6=Gregory F.|last7=Thome|first7=Joseph J.|last8=Farber|first8=Donna L.|last9=Lutfy|first9=Kabirullah|date=12 March 2015|title=Group 2 innate lymphoid cells promote beiging of white adipose tissue and limit obesity|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=519|issue=7542|pages=242\u2013246|doi=10.1038/nature14115|pmid=25533952|issn=1476-4687|pmc=4447235|bibcode=2015Natur.519..242B}}</ref> \n\nIn addition to ILC2s, ILC1s contribute to the homeostasis of adipose tissue macrophages in both lean and obese conditions, making up 5-10% of the resident lymphocyte population, in human lean adipose depots.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> A high fat diet increases ILC1 number, and activation of adipose tissue, increasing IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 levels.

our immune response to pathogens in all organs, in particular at mucosal surfaces. <ref name=\"Colonna2018\"/> They are key in the innate immune response due to their ability to rapidly secrete immunoregulatory cytokines, however, they also play a role in the shaping of the adaptive response by interacting with other immune cells. The microenvironment of the tissue they reside in determines and fine- tunes the expression of the diverse ILC profiles, facilitating their interaction in multiple effector functions. \n\nThe strategic positioning and deep rooting of ILCs within tissues allow them to maintain homeostasis, and therefore healthy tissue functioning.

Disturbance of the epithelium lining the hepatic [[bile duct]]s is frequently observed in response to chronic liver inflammation, and increased proliferation of these ducts is associated with liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> Evidence suggests that the enhanced proliferation is triggered by IL-13, which is produced by IL-33 induced production of ILC2 cells. ILC2s have also been shown to enhance the progression of liver fibrosis, in turn promoting the development of liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> \n\nThe availability of specific dietary nutrients can affect ILC immune homeostasis by altering the energy stored in the adipose tissue. Adipose tissue maintains metabolism homeostasis and is now considered a fully immunocompetent organ. [[Malnutrition]] and [[gluttony]] can dysregulate ILC responses via changes in dietary nutrients, having direct effects on the energy stored in the adipose tissue.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> Obesity is associated with changes of gastrointestinal flora, increased afflux of free [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty acids]] from adipose tissue into the liver and increased gut permeability.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> The close anatomical proximity of the gastrointestinal tract and the liver means [[transportation]] of bacterial metabolites through the [[portal vein]] triggers inflammation, acting on innate immune cells, including ILC1s, therefore playing an important role in the activation of an inflammatory state in the liver. Therefore, inflammation associated with obesity can influence the progression of liver disease, due to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> ILC1s as a key regulatory of adipose tissue inflammation, is therefore a potential therapeutic target for treating people with liver disease or [[metabolic syndrome]]. \n\nILC2s have also been identified in human and mouse [[white adipose tissue]], contributing to the development of obesity. Decreased responses of ILC2s in the tissue are a characteristic of obesity, as this interrupts their crucial role in energy homeostasis, resulting in reduced energy expenditure and increased adiposity.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n=== Skin inflammation ===\n\nThe frequency of ILC2s is higher in the inflamed skin of patients with [[atopic dermatitis]] than in healthy patients.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/> The ILC2s from the skin of the patients had upregulation of the IL-25, IL-33, TSLP and PGD2 receptors, suggesting their role in the activation of ILC2s.
