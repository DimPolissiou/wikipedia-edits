Colloquially known as 'Surfers', the suburb has many high-rise apartment buildings and a wide surf beach. The feature of the heart of the suburb is [[Cavill Avenue|Cavill Mall]], which runs through the shopping and entertainment  precinct. [[Cavill Avenue]], named after Jim Cavill, an early hotel owner, is one of the busiest shopping strips in Queensland, and the centre of activity for night life.  One of the features of the area is the [[Surfers Paradise Meter Maids]] designed to build goodwill with tourists.\n\nSurfers Paradise is the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]'s  entertainment and tourism centre and the suburb's high-rise buildings are the best known feature of the city's skyline.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, Surfers Paradise was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for its role as a \"location\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND\u2019S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|website=|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|url-status=|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the {{CensusAU|2011}}, Surfers Paradise had a population of 19,668.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Aerial panorama of Surfer's Paradise.jpg|thumb|Aerial perspective of the coast along Surfer's Paradise.

The farm proved unsuccessful and was sold in 1877 to German [[immigrant]] [[Johan Meyer]], who turned the land into a sugar farm and mill. Meyer also had little luck growing in the sandy soil and within a decade had auctioned the farm and started a ferry service and built the Main Beach hotel. By 1889, Meyer's hotel had become a post receiving office and subdivisions surrounding it were named '''Elston''', named by the [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]] postmaster after his wife's home in [[Southport]], [[Lancashire]], England. The Main Beach Hotel licence lapsed after Meyer's death in 1901 and for 16 years Elston was a tourist town without a hotel or post office.<ref>* [http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/thegoldcoast/surfers-paradise-history-2764.html Gold Coast City Council \u2013 Early History of Surfers Paradise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604051245/http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/thegoldcoast/surfers-paradise-history-2764.html |date=4 June 2016 }}.

Elston was no longer cut off by the river and speculators began buying land around Elston and [[Burleigh Heads, Queensland|Burleigh Heads]]. Estates down the coast were promoted and hotels opened to accommodate tourists and investors.\n\nIn 1925, Brisbane hotelier [[James Cavill|Jim Cavill]] opened the [[Surfers Paradise Hotel]] located on what would later become the site of the Surfers Paradise Centre which incorporates the Surfers Paradise Beer Garden and Hard Rock Cafe. In opening the hotel and neighbouring zoo, Cavill created the first attraction in the suburb. Located between the ferry jetty and the white surf beach off the South Coast Road, it became popular and shops and services sprang up around it. In the following years Cavill pushed to have the name Elston changed to Surfers' Paradise. The suburb was officially renamed on 1 December 1933 after the local council felt the Surfers Paradise name was more marketable.<ref>{{cite news|title=Surfers to celebrate 80th birthday|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2013/03/10/448309_gold-coast-news.html|access-date=22 June 2013|newspaper=goldcoast.com.au|date=10 March 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312050218/http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2013/03/10/448309_gold-coast-news.html|archive-date=12 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In July 1936 Cavill's timber hotel burnt to the ground and was rebuilt the following year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article194271494 |title=\u00a325,000 FIRE. |newspaper=[[Daily Examiner]] |location=Grafton, NSW |date=7 July 1936 |accessdate=17 January 2016 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37897199 |title=NEW SURFERS' PARADISE HOTEL OPENING. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=21 September 1937 |accessdate=17 January 2016 |page=22 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nA development boom followed in the 1950s and 1960s. The first highrise in Surfers Paradise was erected in 1959 and was named the Kinkabool. The Kinkabool stood 10 stories high and remains to this day in Hanlan Street.  Many tall apartment buildings were constructed in the decades that followed, including the iconic buildings included the Iluka, St Tropez and [[The Pink Poodle]]. The boom later saw strong Japanese investment in the 1980s.\n\nLittle remains of the early vegetation or natural features of the area and even the historical association of the beachfront development with the river is tenuous. The early subdivision pattern remains, although later reclamation of the islands in the [[Nerang River]] as housing estates (e.g. [[Chevron Island]]), and the bridges to those islands, have created a contrast reflected in subdivision and building form. Some early remnants survived such as [[Budd's Beach]] \u2014 a low-scale open area on the river which even in the early history of the area was a centre for boating, fishing and swimming.\n\nSome minor changes have occurred in extending the road along the beachfront since the early subdivision and The Esplanade road is now a focus of activity, with supporting shops and restaurants. The intensity of activity, centred on Cavill, Orchid and Elkhorn Avenues, is reflected in the density of development. Of all places on the Gold Coast the buildings in this area constitute a dominant and enduring image visible from as far south as [[Coolangatta, Queensland|Coolangatta]] and from the mountain resorts of the hinterland.\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nSurfers Paradise has a number of [[heritage-listed]] structures, including:\n\n*[[The Pink Poodle]] sign, 18 Fern Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://heritage.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/uploads/heritage-register-pdf/GOLDCOASTLOCALHERITAGEREGISTERN-ZNEW.pdf|title = Gold Coast Local Heritage Register: N-Z|date = |access-date = 1 September 2015|website = |publisher = [[City of Gold Coast Council]]|last = |first = |pages = 97\u201398|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150304145914/http://heritage.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/uploads/heritage-register-pdf/GOLDCOASTLOCALHERITAGEREGISTERN-ZNEW.pdf|archive-date = 4 March 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n*[[Kinkabool]], 32-34 Hanlan Street<ref>{{cite QHR|16240|Kinkabool|601477|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> One of the original Apartment blocks In Surfers.\n* Matey, at Cavill Park, a 1957 bronze statue of a homeless dog that lived in Surfers Paradise.

The maids were hired to top up expired parking meters and dressed in gold bikinis. Meter feeding is against the law but council decided to ignore the offence due to the good publicity it garnered. Gold Coast Mayor [[Bruce Small]] promoted the city in 1967 through the use of the bikini-clad meters maids. The evolution of parking meters has rendered the meter maids initial goal useless and are seen as a novelty these days.\n\nThe meter maids initially dressed in gold lam\u00e9 bikinis and a [[tiara]] but the outfit would go through several changes during their existence. The attire has now evolved into a gold [[lycra]] bikini and an [[Akubra]] hat. A sash is often worn emblazoned \"Surfers Paradise Meter Maids\".

The tradition began on the Gold Coast in the early to mid 1980s and Surfers Paradise is still the largest single venue for the event. Prior to the 1980s, school leavers enjoyed one \"muck up day\" at the end of their Senior year, which often ended by meeting up at one of the old beer gardens in Surfers or Broadbeach. Official Schoolies events on the Gold Coast are drug-free and alcohol-free events held on the beach. The events often include concerts and parties.\n\nThe event is often seen as a rite of passage for graduating students and a transitional period from youth to adulthood.  It is constantly criticised as promoting teen sex and under age drinking/drug taking.  The event also attracts over age and under age attendees that are referred to as 'toolies' and 'foolies'.  It is estimated that around 40,000 teenagers travel to the Gold Coast for the Schoolies event every year.  A dedicated Schoolies event zone, featuring live music and youth-themed activities, is established each year on Surfers Paradise Beach in order to provide a safe, fun environment for school leavers.  The area is monitored for exclusive use of current Year 12 school leavers.  Schoolies Hub Beach area opens nightly from 7pm.\n\nVolunteers in bright orange vests are the Schoolies Support Team who provide practical support and advice.

[[Cavill Avenue]], named after Jim Cavill, an early hotel owner, is one of the busiest shopping strips in Queensland, and the centre of activity for night life.  One of the features of the area is the [[Surfers Paradise Meter Maids]] designed to build goodwill with tourists.\n\nSurfers Paradise is the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]'s  entertainment and tourism centre and the suburb's high-rise buildings are the best known feature of the city's skyline.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, Surfers Paradise was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for its role as a \"location\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND\u2019S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|website=|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|url-status=|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the {{CensusAU|2011}}, Surfers Paradise had a population of 19,668. \n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Aerial panorama of Surfer's Paradise.jpg|thumb|Aerial perspective of the coast along Surfer's Paradise.

The farm proved unsuccessful and was sold in 1877 to German [[immigrant]] [[Johan Meyer]], who turned the land into a sugar farm and mill. Meyer also had little luck growing in the sandy soil and within a decade had auctioned the farm and started a ferry service and built the Main Beach hotel. By 1889, Meyer's hotel had become a post receiving office and subdivisions surrounding it were named '''Elston''', named by the [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]] postmaster after his wife's home in [[Southport]], [[Lancashire]], England.

Elston was no longer cut off by the river and speculators began buying land around Elston and [[Burleigh Heads, Queensland|Burleigh Heads]]. Estates down the coast were promoted and hotels opened to accommodate tourists and investors.\n\nIn 1925, Brisbane hotelier [[James Cavill|Jim Cavill]] opened the [[Surfers Paradise Hotel]] located on what would later become the site of the Surfers Paradise Centre which incorporates the Surfers Paradise Beer Garden and Hard Rock Cafe. In opening the hotel and neighbouring zoo, Cavill created the first attraction in the suburb. Located between the ferry jetty and the white surf beach off the South Coast Road, it became popular and shops and services sprang up around it. In the following years Cavill pushed to have the name Elston changed to Surfers' Paradise. The suburb was officially renamed on 1 December 1933 after the local council felt the Surfers Paradise name was more marketable.<ref>{{cite news|title=Surfers to celebrate 80th birthday|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2013/03/10/448309_gold-coast-news.html|access-date=22 June 2013|newspaper=goldcoast.com.au|date=10 March 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312050218/http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2013/03/10/448309_gold-coast-news.html|archive-date=12 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In July 1936 Cavill's timber hotel burnt to the ground and was rebuilt the following year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article194271494 |title=\u00a325,000 FIRE. |newspaper=[[Daily Examiner]] |location=Grafton, NSW |date=7 July 1936 |accessdate=17 January 2016 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37897199 |title=NEW SURFERS' PARADISE HOTEL OPENING. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=21 September 1937 |accessdate=17 January 2016 |page=22 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nA development boom followed in the 1950s and 1960s. The first highrise in Surfers Paradise was erected in 1959 and was named the Kinkabool. The Kinkabool stood 10 stories high and remains to this day in Hanlan Street.  Many tall apartment buildings were constructed in the decades that followed, including the iconic buildings included the Iluka, St Tropez and [[The Pink Poodle]]. The boom later saw strong Japanese investment in the 1980s.\n\nLittle remains of the early vegetation or natural features of the area and even the historical association of the beachfront development with the river is tenuous. The early subdivision pattern remains, although later reclamation of the islands in the [[Nerang River]] as housing estates (e.g. [[Chevron Island]]), and the bridges to those islands, have created a contrast reflected in subdivision and building form. Some early remnants survived such as [[Budd's Beach]] \u2014 a low-scale open area on the river which even in the early history of the area was a centre for boating, fishing and swimming.\n\nSome minor changes have occurred in extending the road along the beachfront since the early subdivision and The Esplanade road is now a focus of activity, with supporting shops and restaurants. The intensity of activity, centred on Cavill, Orchid and Elkhorn Avenues, is reflected in the density of development. Of all places on the Gold Coast the buildings in this area constitute a dominant and enduring image visible from as far south as [[Coolangatta, Queensland|Coolangatta]] and from the mountain resorts of the hinterland.\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nSurfers Paradise has a number of [[heritage-listed]] structures, including:\n\n*[[The Pink Poodle]] sign, 18 Fern Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://heritage.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/uploads/heritage-register-pdf/GOLDCOASTLOCALHERITAGEREGISTERN-ZNEW.pdf|title = Gold Coast Local Heritage Register: N-Z|date = |access-date = 1 September 2015|website = |publisher = [[City of Gold Coast Council]]|last = |first = |pages = 97\u201398|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150304145914/http://heritage.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/uploads/heritage-register-pdf/GOLDCOASTLOCALHERITAGEREGISTERN-ZNEW.pdf|archive-date = 4 March 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n*[[Kinkabool]], 32-34 Hanlan Street<ref>{{cite QHR|16240|Kinkabool|601477|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> One of the original Apartment blocks In Surfers.\n* Matey, at Cavill Park, a 1957 bronze statue of a homeless dog that lived in Surfers Paradise.

The maids were hired to top up expired parking meters and dressed in gold bikinis. Meter feeding is against the law but council decided to ignore the offence due to the good publicity it garnered. Gold Coast Mayor [[Bruce Small]] promoted the city in 1967 through the use of the bikini-clad meters maids. The evolution of parking meters has rendered the meter maids initial goal useless and are seen as a novelty these days.\n\nThe meter maids initially dressed in gold lam\u00e9 bikinis and a [[tiara]] but the outfit would go through several changes during their existence. The attire has now evolved into a gold [[lycra]] bikini and an [[Akubra]] hat. A sash is often worn emblazoned \"Surfers Paradise Meter Maids\".

The tradition began on the Gold Coast in the early to mid 1980s and Surfers Paradise is still the largest single venue for the event. Prior to the 1980s, school leavers enjoyed one \"muck up day\" at the end of their Senior year, which often ended by meeting up at one of the old beer gardens in Surfers or Broadbeach. Official Schoolies events on the Gold Coast are drug-free and alcohol-free events held on the beach. The events often include concerts and parties.\n\nThe event is often seen as a rite of passage for graduating students and a transitional period from youth to adulthood.  It is constantly criticised as promoting teen sex and under age drinking/drug taking.  The event also attracts over age and under age attendees that are referred to as 'toolies' and 'foolies'.  It is estimated that around 40,000 teenagers travel to the Gold Coast for the Schoolies event every year.  A dedicated Schoolies event zone, featuring live music and youth-themed activities, is established each year on Surfers Paradise Beach in order to provide a safe, fun environment for school leavers.  The area is monitored for exclusive use of current Year 12 school leavers.  Schoolies Hub Beach area opens nightly from 7pm.\n\nVolunteers in bright orange vests are the Schoolies Support Team who provide practical support and advice.  Recharge Zones are located close to the Schoolies Hub to provide a safe place to keep hydrated with free water available.<ref>[http://www.schoolies.qld.gov.au/schoolies/where-and-when/gold-coast Gold Coast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215601/http://www.schoolies.qld.gov.au/schoolies/where-and-when/gold-coast |date=4 October 2013 }}.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\nWhile sailing yachts continued to exist, the development of reliable power plants created a new category of pleasure craft. The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine.\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power.

Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[File:80 foot motor yacht Alchemist photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|350px|The Lazzara 80-foot ''Alchemist'' on the California Coast]]\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\nWhile sailing yachts continued to exist, the development of reliable power plants created a new category of pleasure craft. The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine.\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?d=UmMx9ixu90kC&pg=PA190&dq=electrical+power+generators+steam+percent&hl=en&ei=JppoTpVexNmBB4C72MkM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=steam&f=false|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century.

Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[File:80 foot motor yacht Alchemist photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|350px|The Lazzara 80-foot ''Alchemist'' on the California Coast]]\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

The Bureau of Detectives is Headed by the Chief of Detectives. The Detective Division includes the three Area Detective Divisions. The Deputy Chief of the Special Investigations Unit oversees the Central Investigations Division, the Forensic Services Division which includes the Mobile Crime Lab of Forensic Investigators, ET-North and ET-South\u2014which are the two Evidence Technician Units, and the Youth Investigations Division.\n\nThe Counter terrorism and Intelligence Division includes the Deployment Operations Center Section, the Intelligence Section, the Airport Law Enforcement Section, the Public Transportation Section, and the Bomb and Arson Section. The Organized Crime Division includes the Narcotics Section, Gang Investigations Section, Gang Enforcement Section, Vice Control Section, and the Asset Forfeiture Unit.\n\nThe Chief of Detectives heads the Detective Division; the Chief of Organized Crime heads that division\u2014both reporting to the First Deputy Superintendent. Two Deputy Chiefs assist the Chief of Detectives while one Deputy Chief assists the Chief of OCD.\n\nThe city is covered by three Detective Division Areas (North, Central, and South), each led by a Commander.\n\n===Bureau of Patrol===\n\nThe Bureau of Patrol includes the twenty-two districts. Also included in the Bureau of Patrol are the Special Functions Group, the Marine & Helicopter Unit, Mounted Unit, SWAT, the Traffic Section, and the Canine Unit.\n\nFollowing the disbanding of the Special Operations Section in 2007 after much negative publicity and controversies, the Special Functions Group was formed to absorb the specialized units that were not associated with the controversial plain-clothes unit known informally as SOS. A full-time [[SWAT]] team, organized in 2005, includes 70 members. The Motor Unit, based at O'Hare International Airport, is the only unit that uses two-wheeled motorcycles. It includes 28 members as of 2018. They participate in dignitary escorts, parades, and processions for fallen officers. The Mounted Unit maintains 32 [[gelding|gelded]] horses at the [[South Shore Cultural Center]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://portal.chicagopolice.org/portal/page/portal/ClearPath/About%20CPD/Specialized%20Units/Mounted%20Unit |title=Mounted Unit |publisher=Portal.chicagopolice.org |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2018-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116142729/https://portal.chicagopolice.org/portal/page/portal/ClearPath/About%20CPD/Specialized%20Units/Mounted%20Unit |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The marine unit maintains nine boats; these bear an angled rendering of the Chicago City Flag at the bow, patterned after the [[United States Coast Guard]] \"racing stripe\".\n\n===Ranks===\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n{| cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Insignia\n!Notes\n|-\n|Superintendent of Police\n|[[Image:US-O10 insignia.svg|center|108px]]\n|Appointed by the Mayor of Chicago.

The stars of most Chicago Police officers (patrol officers through to captain) are of silver-colored metal, with broad points. Command ranks have gold-colored stars with sharp points. A ring surrounding the full-color city seal in the star's center changes color for each rank within these two classifications. Like most American police forces, the officer's rank is written in an arc above the center element.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department's shoulder sleeve insignia, worn on the top of the left sleeve, is unusual in two regards.\n\n* Its shape is octagonal instead of one of the more typical shapes used by most other American police forces.\n* The embroidery colors vary depending upon the wearer's rank. In all cases, the patch is a white octagon with a full-color rendering of the city seal, ringed in gold, with \"Chicago\" written in an arc above the seal, and \"Police\" written in an arc below the seal. For patrol officers and detectives (detectives are occasionally uniformed for ceremonies and details), the octagon's outer edge is finished in dark blue thread, and the text is embroidered in dark blue thread. For sergeants, lieutenants and captains, the octagon's outer edge is finished in gold-colored thread, and the text is embroidered in dark blue thread. For \"command ranks\" (commander through superintendent), the octagon's outer edge is finished in gold-colored thread, and the text is embroidered in gold-colored thread.\n\nService longevity is reflected just above the left cuff on most outer garments. Five years of service are indicated by a horizontal bar, embroidered in gold-colored thread; ten years by two bars; fifteen by three bars; twenty by a five-pointed star, embroidered in gold colored thread; twenty-five by one star and one bar and so-forth.\n\nAn embroidered rendering of the [[flag of Chicago]], its borders finished in gold-colored thread, is worn on the right shoulder sleeve.\n\nA two-part nameplate in gold-colored metal is worn above the right pocket. The upper portion bears the officer's name; the lower portion indicates the district or command to which the officer is assigned.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department is one of only a handful of police agencies in the United States to use the checkered bands on its headgear, known as the [[Sillitoe Tartan]] after its originator, [[Percy Sillitoe]], Chief Constable of [[Glasgow]], Scotland in the 1930s. Where British, Australian and New Zealand Sillitoe tartans feature three rows of smaller squares, Chicago's has two rows of larger squares. The checkerboard colors for patrol officers, detectives, dogs and horses are blue and white; the colors for sergeants and higher ranks are blue and gold. [[Peaked cap|Service caps]], the [[campaign hat]]s of the mounted unit, bicycle helmets, knit caps, dog collars, and horse browbands all bear the Sillitoe tartan; the edge of the ball caps' bills show a narrow, flattened Silitoe tartan. The department also uses the pattern on some signage, graphics, and architectural detail on newer police stations.\n\n===Salary===\n\nStarting salary for Chicago police officers in 2016 is $48,078 increased to $72,510 after 18 months. Promotions to specialized or command positions also increases an officer's base pay. Salaries were supplemented with a $2,920 annual duty availability and an $1,800 annual uniform allowance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://directives.chicagopolice.org/forms/CPD-61.400.pdf|title=2012 Position & Salary Schedule \u2013 Chicago Police Department|publisher=Chicago Police Department|accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nIn 2017, the composition of the department's sworn personnel by gender was 77% male and  23% female.<ref name=\"annual report\" /> In 2017, the composition of the department's sworn personnel by race was:<ref name=\"annual report\">[https://home.chicagopolice.org/inside-the-cpd/statistical-reports/annual-reports/ Inside the CPD]</ref>\n* 50% non-Hispanic White\n* 25% Hispanic (of any race)\n* 21% African American\n* 3% Asian American/Pacific Islander\n* 1% other\n\n==Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy (C.A.P.S.)==\n\n{{Main|Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy}}\n[[File:Chicago Police Interceptor Utility.JPG|thumb|right|Chicago Police Department [[Ford Explorer#Ford Police Interceptor Utility|Ford Interceptor Utility]]]]\n\nThe Chicago Police Department is often credited for advancing [[community policing]] through the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy program. It was established in 1992 and implemented in 1993 by then-Chicago Police Superintendent Matt L. Rodriguez. CAPS is an ongoing effort to bring communities, police, and other city agencies together to prevent crimes rather than react to crimes after they happen. The program entails increasing police presence in individual communities with a force of neighborhood-based beat officers. Beat Community Meetings are held regularly for community members and police officials to discuss potential problems and strategies.\n\nUnder CAPS, 9-10 beat officers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.chicagopolice.org/get-involved-with-caps/how-caps-works/beat-officers/|title=Beat Officers   {{!}} Chicago Police Department|website=home.chicagopolice.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316114022/http://home.chicagopolice.org/get-involved-with-caps/how-caps-works/beat-officers/|archive-date=March 16, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> are assigned to each of Chicago's 279 police beats. The officers patrol the same beat for over a year, allowing them to get to know community members, residents, and business owners and to become familiar with community attitudes and trends. The system also allows for those same community members to get to know their respective officers and learn to be comfortable in approaching them for help when needed. Beat officers are fully equipped and patrol their neighborhoods in a variety of methods: by bike, by car, by ATV, by Segway, or by foot.\n\n== Strategic Subject List (SSL) ==\n\n'''Strategic Subject List (SSL)''' is an implementation of a computer algorithm developed by the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]. SSL calculates the propensity of individuals committing or being targeted by gun violence. The fourth iteration now in use, has become a helpful indicator of murders, according to Eddie Johnson, recent former Superintendent of Police.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21699912-hot-summer-awaits-citys-new-police-chief-predictable-policing|title=Predictable policing|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-06-05}}</ref>\n\nThe system looks at an individual's past criminal activities and specifically excludes biasing variables like race, gender, ethnicity and location according to Illinois Institute of Technology professor Miles Wernick.

John Joseph Flinn and John Elbert Wilkie.

He in turn would appoint a Common Constable from each of the six city wards.\n\n====1840s\u20131850s====\n\nIn 1855, the newly elected city council passed ordinances to formally establish the Chicago Police Department. Chicago was divided into three police precincts, each served by a station house. Station No. 1 was located in a building on State Street between Lake and Randolph streets. Station No. 2 was on West Randolph Street near Des Plaines Street. Station No. 3 was on Michigan Street (since then renamed Hubbard Street<ref name=\"Michigan Street\">{{cite web |url=http://forgottenchicago.com/features/chicago-infrastructure/long-lost-loop-lanes/ |title=Forgotten Chicago|publisher=Forgotten Chicago |accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref>) near Clark Street. Political connections were important to joining the force; formal requirements were few, until 1895. After 1856, the department hired many foreign-born recruits, especially unskilled, but English-speaking, Irish immigrants.\n\n====1860s\u20131870s====\n\nIn 1860, the detective forces were established to investigate and solve crimes. In 1861, the Illinois General Assembly passed a law creating a police board to become an executive department of Chicago autonomous of the mayor. The mayor was effectively stripped of his power to control the Chicago Police Department. Authority was given to three police commissioners. The commissioners created the office of superintendent to be the chief of police. The title is again in use today.\n\nThe first African American officer was appointed in 1872, but black police were assigned to duty in plain clothes only, mainly in largely black neighborhoods. In 1875, the Illinois General Assembly found that the police commissioners were unable to control rampant corruption within the Chicago Police Department. The legislature passed a new law returning power over the police to the mayor. The mayor was allowed to appoint a single police commissioner with the advice and consent of the city council.\n\n====1880s\u20131890s====\n\nIn 1896, a parade of Chicago police officers were the subject of the first film ever to be shot in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/April-2011/The-First-Movie-Ever-Shot-in-Chicago/|title=The First Movie Ever Shot in Chicago|publisher=|accessdate=March 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWomen entered the force in 1885, as [[matrons]], caring for female prisoners. [[Marie Owens]] is believed to have been the first female police officer in the U.S., joining the Chicago Police Department in 1891, retiring in 1923.

Decentralization meant that police could respond to local concerns, but graft often determined which concerns got most attention. In 1895, Chicago adopted civil service procedures, and written tests became the basis for hiring and promotion.

In 1918, Grace Wilson, possibly the first black female police officer in United States history, joined the force.\n\nIn 1917, the Chicago Police Reserves were formed, organised on a regimental basis. They were used to assist or replace regular officers in high-crowd events, such as [[Memorial Day]], and during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], worked for two weeks to enforce stringent health regulations.\n\n====1920s\u20131930s====\nIn 1920, the Chicago Police Reserves were disbanded, owing to the failure of the City Council to provide for their organisation.\n\nThe [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]] led to the creation of the United States' first crime laboratory at [[Northwestern University]], purchased by the Department in 1938.\n\n====1940s\u20131950s====\n{{Expand section|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe Department's Mounted Patrol was disbanded in 1948.\n\n====1960s\u20131970s====\n[[O.

The episode \"The Jumper\" featured an officer taking bribes. It was reportedly this depiction that prompted then-Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] to thereafter discourage motion picture and television location filming in the city for the rest of his administration and its aftermath. [[John Landis]]' successful 1980 musical comedy motion picture ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (see more below) marked the reversal of that policy by Mayor [[Jane Byrne]].\n* Two notable exceptions to Daley's ban were made for films released in 1975. In ''[[Brannigan (film)|Brannigan]]'', [[John Wayne]] portrays Chicago Police Lieutenant Jim Brannigan. ''[[Cooley High]]'' (set in 1964) was filmed entirely in Chicago and features a car chase through [[Navy Pier]]'s warehouse buildings (since demolished), in which the pursuing Chicago police are repeatedly outmaneuvered by the joyriding teens.\n* The Chicago Police Department and [[Illinois State Police]] are featured in the climactic car chase in 1980's ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' in which a Chicago Police dispatcher matter-of-factly advises responding officers that \"The use of unnecessary violence in the apprehension of the Blues Brothers has been approved.\" Reportedly in response to their portrayal in ''The Blues Brothers'', the Chicago Police Department banned the use of the \"Chicago Police\" name and insignia in films until the early 2000s, resulting in several films and television shows replacing \"Chicago Police\" with \"Metro Police\" and other faux names, even if the films received technical assistance from the department, such as ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' and ''[[The Negotiator (film)|The Negotiator]]''.\n* The television series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' (1981\u20131987) never explicitly stated the name of the city in which it was set, although many exterior views (lacking the principal actors) were filmed in Chicago and used for establishing and transition shots. See the [[Hill Street Blues|main article]] for expanded discussion on the setting.\n* [[Robert De Niro]] portrays a former Chicago police officer turned bounty hunter in the 1988 film ''[[Midnight Run]]''. Numerous references are made to the CPD as well as corruption within the department. There are also a number of scenes directly involving the CPD.\n* The Chicago Police Department played a major role in 1993's ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', showing them in a semi-brutal fashion after Kimble is incorrectly believed to have killed an on-duty police officer. The use of actual Chicago Police Department vehicles and uniforms is extensive and can be seen throughout the film.\n* In the 1998 film ''[[The Negotiator (film)|The Negotiator]]'', the Chicago Police played a major role within the film. The real Chicago Police Department provided technical support for the movie's SWAT teams. The actors' shoulder sleeve insignia were similar to the Chicago Police Department's octagonal patches, albeit with \"Chicago\" replaced with \"Metropolitan.\"\n* Chicago police officers are routinely depicted on the television series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.\n* The Chicago police are portrayed in the 2011 [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] series ''[[The Chicago Code]]''.

Daley|Mayor Richard J. Daley]]. That year, eight officers from the Summerdale police district on Chicago's North Side were accused of operating a large-scale burglary ring. The Summerdale case dominated the local press, and became the biggest police-related scandal in the city's history at the time. Mayor Daley appointed a committee to make recommendations for improvements to the police department. The action resulted in the creation of a five-member board charged with nominating a superintendent to be the chief authority over police officers, enacting rules and regulations governing the police system, submitting budget requests to the city council, and overseeing disciplinary cases involving officers.<ref name=\"nytimes-1960\"/> [[Criminology|Criminologist]] [[O.W.

Despite the poor behavior of some protesters, there was widespread criticism that the Chicago Police and [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] used [[police brutality|excessive force]]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' published an article stating:\n\n{{quote|With billy clubs, tear gas and Mace, the blue-shirted, blue-helmeted cops violated the civil rights of countless innocent citizens and contravened every accepted code of professional police discipline. No one could accuse the Chicago cops of discrimination. They savagely attacked [[hippie]]s, [[yippie]]s, New Leftists, revolutionaries, dissident Democrats, newsmen, photographers, passers-by, clergymen and at least one handicapped. [[Winston Churchill]]'s journalist grandson got roughed up. Even [[Dan Rather]] (the future [[CBS News]] anchor) who was on the floor doing a report during the convention got roughed up by the Chicago Police Department.

Though the police claimed they had been attacked by heavily armed Panthers, subsequent investigation showed that most bullets fired came from police weapons. Relatives of the two dead men eventually won a multimillion-dollar judgment against the city. For many [[African Americans]], the incident symbolized prejudice and lack of restraint among the largely white police. The incident led to growing black voter disaffection with the [[Cook County Democratic Party|Democratic machine]].<ref name=\"Police\"/>\n\n===Ryan Harris murder===\nOn July 28, 1998, an 11-year-old girl, Ryan Harris, was found raped and murdered in a vacant lot in the city's [[Englewood, Chicago|Englewood]] neighborhood. The [[homicide]] caught the nation's attention when, 12 days after Ryan's body was found, authorities, with the blessing of police command, charged a 7-year-old boy and 8-year-old boy with the murder, making them the youngest murder suspects in the nation at the time.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0508010193aug01,0,7681174.story?coll=chi-news-hed |title=Ryan Harris' slaying haunts mother and city|work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=2007-04-14 | first=Carlos | last=Sadovi}}</ref> [[Semen]] found at the scene and subsequent [[DNA]] tests totally cleared the boys of the crime and pointed to convicted sex offender Floyd Durr.

In the first incident, Russ, an honor student and star football player for [[Northwestern University]], was shot inside of his car. This followed a high-speed chase and what the police claim was a struggle with the officer who shot him. In the second, Haggarty, a computer analyst, was shot by a female officer. Charges of racism against the CPD persisted. Both shootings resulted in lawsuits and Haggerty's family reached an $18 million settlement with the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/32613|title=Chicago Judge OKs $18M Settlement |publisher=DigitalJournal.com |accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Malcolm Gladwell]]'s book on the cognitive function of snap judgments, ''[[Blink (book)|Blink]]'',<ref>[[Malcolm Gladwell|Gladwell, Malcolm]] (2005). ''Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking''. New York: Black Bay Books/[[Little, Brown and Company]]. {{ISBN|978-0-316-01066-5}}.</ref> well-known criminologist and police administrator [[James Fyfe]] said that Chicago police instructions in cases such as Russ's were \"very detailed\".<ref name=\"Gladwell, p. 228\">Gladwell, p. 228.</ref> He said that the record shows that the officers involved all broke procedure and let the situation become unnecessarily deadly for the suspect. For instance, after claiming to see Russ drive erratically, the officers engaged in a driving pursuit. The pursuit, labeled \"high-speed\", did not exceed 70 miles per hour, but Fyfe contends that the adrenaline rush of the chase, coupled with the officers' reliance in their numbers, led to their ignoring impulses to maintain rational thinking in a potentially non-deadly situation. They speeded up a process that both allowed and required taking things more slowly and methodically. Russ's car spun out on the [[Ryan Expressway]], at which point several officers quickly approached his vehicle. According to Gladwell, the false safety of numbers gave the three officers \"the bravado to rush the car\". Fyfe adds, \"The lawyers [for the police] were saying that this was a fast-breaking situation. But it was only fast-breaking because the cops let it become one. He was stopped. He wasn't going anywhere.\"\n\nFyfe describes appropriate police procedure and contrasts the events that contributed to Russ's death thus,\n\n{{quote|[According to police instructions] You are not supposed to approach the car. You are supposed to ask the driver to get out. Well, two of the cops ran up ahead and opened the passenger side door. The other [officer] was on the other side, yelling at Russ to open the door. But Russ just sat there. I don't know what was going through his head. But he didn't respond. So this cop smashes the left rear window of his car and fires a single shot, and it hits Russ in the hand and chest. The cop says that he said, 'Show me your hands, show me your hands,' and he's claiming now that Russ was trying to grab his gun. I don't know if that was the case. I have to accept the cop's claim. But it's beside the point. It's still an unjustified shooting because he shouldn't have been anywhere near the car, and he shouldn't have broken the window.<ref>[[Malcolm Gladwell|Gladwell, Malcolm]] (2005).

They were alleged to have robbed [[drug dealers]] and ordinary citizens of money, drugs, and guns. The officers were all part of [[Special Operations Sections]] (SOS). The officers had allegedly victimized citizens for years; however,  allegations of their misconduct was not investigated until 2004. According to the [[State's Attorney]], the officers repeatedly missed court dates and allowed alleged drug dealers to go free. Several lawsuits alleging misconduct on behalf of Finnigan and his team have been filed in [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Since the original indictments, Jerome Finnigan has also been charged with attempting to have several fellow officers killed. Since the scandal involving Finnigan, SOS has been disbanded.\n\nOn February 11, 2009, charges against Chicago Police Department officers Tom Sherry and Carl Suchocki were dropped. A Cook County judge dismissed all criminal charges accusing them of robbery and home invasion after some evidence was proven to be false, and witnesses in the case against Sherry and Suchocki were unable to place the officers at the scene of the crime. Charges against Herrera and Finnigan, however, are still pending. As of September 25, 2009, seven former SOS officers have pleaded guilty to charges relating to the scandal. The investigation is ongoing as police officers continue to come forward and cooperate with the state and federal investigation.<ref>{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214153926/http://suntimes.com/news/metro/1424681%2Cdropped-charges-officers-chicago-021109.article|url=http://suntimes.com/news/metro/1424681,dropped-charges-officers-chicago-021109.article|archivedate=February 14, 2009|author=Frank Main and Rummana Hussain|date=February 11, 2009|title=Charges dropped against Special Operations Section officers|work=Chicago Sun-Times|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/indict/2007/us_v_finnigan_complaint.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812120750/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/indict/2007/us_v_finnigan_complaint.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-12 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2011-08-12 |accessdate=2013-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/indict/2007/us_v_finnigan_complaint.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812120750/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/indict/2007/us_v_finnigan_complaint.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-12 |title=Murder for Hire |access-date=2007-09-01}}</ref><ref>[http://cbs2chicago.com/local/special.operations.officers.2.932579.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411122436/http://cbs2chicago.com/local/special.operations.officers.2.932579.html |date=April 11, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://cbs2chicago.com/local/police.corruption.case.2.1208809.html]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name=antlers>{{cite web|title=Chicago police put antlers on black man and posed for pictures|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/05/27/chicago-police-put-antlers-black-man-posed-pictures/ |publisher=[[First Look Media]]|accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Shooting of Flint Farmer===\n\nOn June 7, 2011, Flint Farmer was fatally shot three times in the back by [[Chicago]] police officer Gildardo Sierra.

Currently, the [[Superintendent of Police|Chicago Superintendent of Police]] is [[David Brown (police officer)|David Brown]] who replaced interim Superintendent of Police [[Charlie Beck]] in 2020.\n\nThe Superintendent of Police serves as the senior sworn member of the Chicago Police. [[David Brown (police officer)|David Brown]] is the 63rd individual to hold the post, which prior to 1835 was known as High Constable, City Marshall, Chief, General Superintendent, Commissioner and Superintendent of Police .\n\nThe Office of the Superintendent is responsible for critical functions such as planning and implementing the Community Policing Strategy, facilitating and coordinating law enforcement services, planning police coverage at public gatherings, addressing legal and legislative matters, administering labor agreements and providing a liaison to the news media. [[Mayor of Chicago]].\n\n===Bureau of Detectives===\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nInvestigative functions are under the Bureau of Detectives. The Bureau of Detectives is Headed by the Chief of Detectives. The Detective Division includes the three Area Detective Divisions. The Deputy Chief of the Special Investigations Unit oversees the Central Investigations Division, the Forensic Services Division which includes the Mobile Crime Lab of Forensic Investigators, ET-North and ET-South\u2014which are the two Evidence Technician Units, and the Youth Investigations Division.\n\nThe Counter terrorism and Intelligence Division includes the Deployment Operations Center Section, the Intelligence Section, the Airport Law Enforcement Section, the Public Transportation Section, and the Bomb and Arson Section. The Organized Crime Division includes the Narcotics Section, Gang Investigations Section, Gang Enforcement Section, Vice Control Section, and the Asset Forfeiture Unit.\n\nThe Chief of Detectives heads the Detective Division; the Chief of Organized Crime heads that division\u2014both reporting to the First Deputy Superintendent. Two Deputy Chiefs assist the Chief of Detectives while one Deputy Chief assists the Chief of OCD.\n\nThe city is covered by three Detective Division Areas (North, Central, and South), each led by a Commander.\n\n===Bureau of Patrol===\n\nThe Bureau of Patrol includes the twenty-two districts. Also included in the Bureau of Patrol are the Special Functions Group, the Marine & Helicopter Unit, Mounted Unit, SWAT, the Traffic Section, and the Canine Unit.\n\nFollowing the disbanding of the Special Operations Section in 2007 after much negative publicity and controversies, the Special Functions Group was formed to absorb the specialized units that were not associated with the controversial plain-clothes unit known informally as SOS. A full-time [[SWAT]] team, organized in 2005, includes 70 members. The Motor Unit, based at O'Hare International Airport, is the only unit that uses two-wheeled motorcycles. It includes 28 members as of 2018. They participate in dignitary escorts, parades, and processions for fallen officers. The Mounted Unit maintains 32 [[gelding|gelded]] horses at the [[South Shore Cultural Center]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://portal.chicagopolice.org/portal/page/portal/ClearPath/About%20CPD/Specialized%20Units/Mounted%20Unit |title=Mounted Unit |publisher=Portal.chicagopolice.org |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2018-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116142729/https://portal.chicagopolice.org/portal/page/portal/ClearPath/About%20CPD/Specialized%20Units/Mounted%20Unit |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The marine unit maintains nine boats; these bear an angled rendering of the Chicago City Flag at the bow, patterned after the [[United States Coast Guard]] \"racing stripe\".\n\n===Ranks===\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n{| cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Insignia\n!Notes\n|-\n|Superintendent of Police\n|[[Image:US-O10 insignia.svg|center|108px]]\n|Appointed by the Mayor of Chicago.

The stars of most Chicago Police officers (patrol officers through to captain) are of silver-colored metal, with broad points. Command ranks have gold-colored stars with sharp points. A ring surrounding the full-color city seal in the star's center changes color for each rank within these two classifications. Like most American police forces, the officer's rank is written in an arc above the center element.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department's shoulder sleeve insignia, worn on the top of the left sleeve, is unusual in two regards.\n\n* Its shape is octagonal instead of one of the more typical shapes used by most other American police forces.\n* The embroidery colors vary depending upon the wearer's rank. In all cases, the patch is a white octagon with a full-color rendering of the city seal, ringed in gold, with \"Chicago\" written in an arc above the seal, and \"Police\" written in an arc below the seal. For patrol officers and detectives (detectives are occasionally uniformed for ceremonies and details), the octagon's outer edge is finished in dark blue thread, and the text is embroidered in dark blue thread. For sergeants, lieutenants and captains, the octagon's outer edge is finished in gold-colored thread, and the text is embroidered in dark blue thread. For \"command ranks\" (commander through superintendent), the octagon's outer edge is finished in gold-colored thread, and the text is embroidered in gold-colored thread.\n\nService longevity is reflected just above the left cuff on most outer garments. Five years of service are indicated by a horizontal bar, embroidered in gold-colored thread; ten years by two bars; fifteen by three bars; twenty by a five-pointed star, embroidered in gold colored thread; twenty-five by one star and one bar and so-forth.\n\nAn embroidered rendering of the [[flag of Chicago]], its borders finished in gold-colored thread, is worn on the right shoulder sleeve.\n\nA two-part nameplate in gold-colored metal is worn above the right pocket. The upper portion bears the officer's name; the lower portion indicates the district or command to which the officer is assigned.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department is one of only a handful of police agencies in the United States to use the checkered bands on its headgear, known as the [[Sillitoe Tartan]] after its originator, [[Percy Sillitoe]], Chief Constable of [[Glasgow]], Scotland in the 1930s. Where British, Australian and New Zealand Sillitoe tartans feature three rows of smaller squares, Chicago's has two rows of larger squares. The checkerboard colors for patrol officers, detectives, dogs and horses are blue and white; the colors for sergeants and higher ranks are blue and gold. [[Peaked cap|Service caps]], the [[campaign hat]]s of the mounted unit, bicycle helmets, knit caps, dog collars, and horse browbands all bear the Sillitoe tartan; the edge of the ball caps' bills show a narrow, flattened Silitoe tartan. The department also uses the pattern on some signage, graphics, and architectural detail on newer police stations.\n\n===Salary===\n\nStarting salary for Chicago police officers in 2016 is $48,078 increased to $72,510 after 18 months. Promotions to specialized or command positions also increases an officer's base pay. Salaries were supplemented with a $2,920 annual duty availability and an $1,800 annual uniform allowance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://directives.chicagopolice.org/forms/CPD-61.400.pdf|title=2012 Position & Salary Schedule \u2013 Chicago Police Department|publisher=Chicago Police Department|accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nIn 2017, the composition of the department's sworn personnel by gender was 77% male and  23% female.<ref name=\"annual report\" /> In 2017, the composition of the department's sworn personnel by race was:<ref name=\"annual report\">[https://home.chicagopolice.org/inside-the-cpd/statistical-reports/annual-reports/ Inside the CPD]</ref>\n* 50% non-Hispanic White\n* 25% Hispanic (of any race)\n* 21% African American\n* 3% Asian American/Pacific Islander\n* 1% other\n\n==Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy (C.A.P.S.)==\n\n{{Main|Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy}}\n[[File:Chicago Police Interceptor Utility.JPG|thumb|right|Chicago Police Department [[Ford Explorer#Ford Police Interceptor Utility|Ford Interceptor Utility]]]]\n\nThe Chicago Police Department is often credited for advancing [[community policing]] through the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy program. It was established in 1992 and implemented in 1993 by then-Chicago Police Superintendent Matt L. Rodriguez. CAPS is an ongoing effort to bring communities, police, and other city agencies together to prevent crimes rather than react to crimes after they happen. The program entails increasing police presence in individual communities with a force of neighborhood-based beat officers. Beat Community Meetings are held regularly for community members and police officials to discuss potential problems and strategies.\n\nUnder CAPS, 9-10 beat officers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.chicagopolice.org/get-involved-with-caps/how-caps-works/beat-officers/|title=Beat Officers   {{!}} Chicago Police Department|website=home.chicagopolice.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316114022/http://home.chicagopolice.org/get-involved-with-caps/how-caps-works/beat-officers/|archive-date=March 16, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> are assigned to each of Chicago's 279 police beats. The officers patrol the same beat for over a year, allowing them to get to know community members, residents, and business owners and to become familiar with community attitudes and trends. The system also allows for those same community members to get to know their respective officers and learn to be comfortable in approaching them for help when needed. Beat officers are fully equipped and patrol their neighborhoods in a variety of methods: by bike, by car, by ATV, by Segway, or by foot.\n\n== Strategic Subject List (SSL) ==\n\n'''Strategic Subject List (SSL)''' is an implementation of a computer algorithm developed by the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]. SSL calculates the propensity of individuals committing or being targeted by gun violence. The fourth iteration now in use, has become a helpful indicator of murders, according to Eddie Johnson, recent former Superintendent of Police.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21699912-hot-summer-awaits-citys-new-police-chief-predictable-policing|title=Predictable policing|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-06-05}}</ref>\n\nThe system looks at an individual's past criminal activities and specifically excludes biasing variables like race, gender, ethnicity and location according to Illinois Institute of Technology professor Miles Wernick. The algorithm assigns scores to individuals based on criminal records as well as any known gang affiliations and other variables.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/05/23/chicago-turns-to-big-data-to-predict-gun-and-gang-violence/|title=Chicago turns to big data to predict gun and gang violence|website=Engadget|access-date=2016-06-05}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2016, the CPD created a list 1,400 of \"strategic subjects\" that has proven to be accurate and helpful to the department. In 2016, over 70 percent of the people shot have been on the list, and 80 percent of the shooters. According to the CPD, 117 of the 140 people arrested during a citywide gang raid performed in 2016 were on the list. The list is used by social workers and community leaders.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/us/armed-with-data-chicago-police-try-to-predict-who-may-shoot-or-be-shot.html|title=Chicago Police Try to Predict Who May Shoot or Be Shot|last=Davey|first=Monica|date=2016-05-23|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-05}}</ref>\n\n==Weapons and duty equipment==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:Chicago Police Camera.jpg|thumb|upright|Chicago Police camera in 2006]]\n[[File:Chicago Police helmet & billy-club.jpg|thumb|Chicago Police helmet & billy-club circa 1968]]\n\nChicago police officers are required to buy their own duty equipment (except Taser x3, x26 and Motorola radio Motorola phone).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} All field officers must also be qualified to carry a [[Taser]].

He in turn would appoint a Common Constable from each of the six city wards.\n\n====1840s\u20131850s====\n\nIn 1855, the newly elected city council passed ordinances to formally establish the Chicago Police Department. Chicago was divided into three police precincts, each served by a station house. Station No. 1 was located in a building on State Street between Lake and Randolph streets. Station No. 2 was on West Randolph Street near Des Plaines Street. Station No. 3 was on Michigan Street (since then renamed Hubbard Street<ref name=\"Michigan Street\">{{cite web |url=http://forgottenchicago.com/features/chicago-infrastructure/long-lost-loop-lanes/ |title=Forgotten Chicago|publisher=Forgotten Chicago |accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref>) near Clark Street. Political connections were important to joining the force; formal requirements were few, until 1895. After 1856, the department hired many foreign-born recruits, especially unskilled, but English-speaking, Irish immigrants.\n\n====1860s\u20131870s====\n\nIn 1860, the detective forces were established to investigate and solve crimes. In 1861, the Illinois General Assembly passed a law creating a police board to become an executive department of Chicago autonomous of the mayor. The mayor was effectively stripped of his power to control the Chicago Police Department. Authority was given to three police commissioners. The commissioners created the office of superintendent to be the chief of police. The title is again in use today.\n\nThe first African American officer was appointed in 1872, but black police were assigned to duty in plain clothes only, mainly in largely black neighborhoods. In 1875, the Illinois General Assembly found that the police commissioners were unable to control rampant corruption within the Chicago Police Department. The legislature passed a new law returning power over the police to the mayor. The mayor was allowed to appoint a single police commissioner with the advice and consent of the city council.\n\n====1880s\u20131890s====\n\nIn 1896, a parade of Chicago police officers were the subject of the first film ever to be shot in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/April-2011/The-First-Movie-Ever-Shot-in-Chicago/|title=The First Movie Ever Shot in Chicago|publisher=|accessdate=March 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWomen entered the force in 1885, as [[matrons]], caring for female prisoners.

Decentralization meant that police could respond to local concerns, but graft often determined which concerns got most attention. In 1895, Chicago adopted civil service procedures, and written tests became the basis for hiring and promotion. Standards for recruits rose, though policing remained political.<ref name=\"Police\">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/983.html |title=Police|publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n\n====1900s\u20131910s====\nIn 1906, the Department's Mounted Patrol was created to provide crowd control, and in 1908, the force was granted its first three motor cars, expanding in 1910 to motorbikes and boats.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://chicagocop.com/html/history/chicago_police_department_historical_timeline.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506074857/http://chicagocop.com/html/history/chicago_police_department_historical_timeline.html#1900's |archive-date=May 6, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Female officers were formally appointed beginning on August 13, 1913, starting with ten officers.

Vehicles were painted blue and white and given blue lightbars, introducing the familiar silitoe tartan headbands, and the official motto, 'We Serve And Protect'. In 1963, the Cadet Program was also introduced.\n\nThe [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] led to major criticism of the Chicago Police's crowd control methods, with the [[Walker Report]] criticizing both the Department and the National Guard for use of excessive force, and called the events a [[police riot]].\n\nThe Department's Mounted Patrol, due to popular demand, was re-established in 1974, renamed imply as the Mounted Unit.\n\n====1980s\u20131990s====\nIn August 1983, the Chicago Police Department's first African American superintendent, Fred Rice, was appointed by Chicago's first African American mayor, Harold Washington, followed by the first Hispanic superintendent, Matt L.

The episode \"The Jumper\" featured an officer taking bribes. It was reportedly this depiction that prompted then-Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] to thereafter discourage motion picture and television location filming in the city for the rest of his administration and its aftermath. [[John Landis]]' successful 1980 musical comedy motion picture ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (see more below) marked the reversal of that policy by Mayor [[Jane Byrne]].\n* Two notable exceptions to Daley's ban were made for films released in 1975. In ''[[Brannigan (film)|Brannigan]]'', [[John Wayne]] portrays Chicago Police Lieutenant Jim Brannigan. ''[[Cooley High]]'' (set in 1964) was filmed entirely in Chicago and features a car chase through [[Navy Pier]]'s warehouse buildings (since demolished), in which the pursuing Chicago police are repeatedly outmaneuvered by the joyriding teens.\n* The Chicago Police Department and [[Illinois State Police]] are featured in the climactic car chase in 1980's ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' in which a Chicago Police dispatcher matter-of-factly advises responding officers that \"The use of unnecessary violence in the apprehension of the Blues Brothers has been approved.\" Reportedly in response to their portrayal in ''The Blues Brothers'', the Chicago Police Department banned the use of the \"Chicago Police\" name and insignia in films until the early 2000s, resulting in several films and television shows replacing \"Chicago Police\" with \"Metro Police\" and other faux names, even if the films received technical assistance from the department, such as ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' and ''[[The Negotiator (film)|The Negotiator]]''.\n* The television series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' (1981\u20131987) never explicitly stated the name of the city in which it was set, although many exterior views (lacking the principal actors) were filmed in Chicago and used for establishing and transition shots. See the [[Hill Street Blues|main article]] for expanded discussion on the setting.\n* [[Robert De Niro]] portrays a former Chicago police officer turned bounty hunter in the 1988 film ''[[Midnight Run]]''. Numerous references are made to the CPD as well as corruption within the department. There are also a number of scenes directly involving the CPD.\n* The Chicago Police Department played a major role in 1993's ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', showing them in a semi-brutal fashion after Kimble is incorrectly believed to have killed an on-duty police officer. The use of actual Chicago Police Department vehicles and uniforms is extensive and can be seen throughout the film.\n* In the 1998 film ''[[The Negotiator (film)|The Negotiator]]'', the Chicago Police played a major role within the film. The real Chicago Police Department provided technical support for the movie's SWAT teams. The actors' shoulder sleeve insignia were similar to the Chicago Police Department's octagonal patches, albeit with \"Chicago\" replaced with \"Metropolitan.\"\n* Chicago police officers are routinely depicted on the television series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.\n* The Chicago police are portrayed in the 2011 [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] series ''[[The Chicago Code]]''. Unlike most depictions of Chicago police, the actors' uniforms and insignia appear to be identical to their real-world counterparts, with the series being filmed on-location in the city.\n* In ''[[The Lincoln Lawyer (film)|The Lincoln Lawyer]]'', Mickey Haller tells Detective Lankford that Frank Levin had been ex-Chicago PD to encourage him to investigate Levin's murder.\n* The ''[[Terra Nova (TV series)|Terra Nova]]'' character Jim Shannon said he was a detective with the department's [[narcotics]] squad.\n* The ''[[Chicago P.D.

The Summerdale case dominated the local press, and became the biggest police-related scandal in the city's history at the time. Mayor Daley appointed a committee to make recommendations for improvements to the police department.

For instance, after claiming to see Russ drive erratically, the officers engaged in a driving pursuit. The pursuit, labeled \"high-speed\", did not exceed 70 miles per hour, but Fyfe contends that the adrenaline rush of the chase, coupled with the officers' reliance in their numbers, led to their ignoring impulses to maintain rational thinking in a potentially non-deadly situation. They speeded up a process that both allowed and required taking things more slowly and methodically. Russ's car spun out on the [[Ryan Expressway]], at which point several officers quickly approached his vehicle. According to Gladwell, the false safety of numbers gave the three officers \"the bravado to rush the car\". Fyfe adds, \"The lawyers [for the police] were saying that this was a fast-breaking situation. But it was only fast-breaking because the cops let it become one. He was stopped. He wasn't going anywhere.\"\n\nFyfe describes appropriate police procedure and contrasts the events that contributed to Russ's death thus,\n\n{{quote|[According to police instructions] You are not supposed to approach the car. You are supposed to ask the driver to get out. Well, two of the cops ran up ahead and opened the passenger side door. The other [officer] was on the other side, yelling at Russ to open the door. But Russ just sat there. I don't know what was going through his head. But he didn't respond. So this cop smashes the left rear window of his car and fires a single shot, and it hits Russ in the hand and chest. The cop says that he said, 'Show me your hands, show me your hands,' and he's claiming now that Russ was trying to grab his gun. I don't know if that was the case. I have to accept the cop's claim. But it's beside the point. It's still an unjustified shooting because he shouldn't have been anywhere near the car, and he shouldn't have broken the window.<ref>[[Malcolm Gladwell|Gladwell, Malcolm]] (2005).

The CPD statement continued by saying \"There are always records of anyone who is arrested by CPD, and this is not any different at Homan Square.\" ''The Guardian'' said the Chicago Police statement did not address how long into an arrest or detention those records are generated or their availability to the public, and that a department spokesperson did not respond to a detailed request for clarification.<ref name=\"Guard-2015-02\"/>\n\n=== Laquan McDonald ===\n{{Main article|Murder of Laquan McDonald}}\n[[File:Chicago Protesters Block Streets Laquan McDonald Video - VOA news.webm|thumb|thumbtime=0:25|[[Voice of America]] news report of the third day of protests in Chicago after the release of a video of the [[shooting of Laquan McDonald]]|261x261px]]\n\nOn October 20, 2014, 17-year-old [[Laquan McDonald]] was fatally shot by Officer Jason Van Dyke.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|title = Chicago cop pleads not guilty |url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/29/us/jason-van-dyke-chicago-police-laquan-mcdonald/index.html|publisher = CNN|access-date = 2015-12-29}}</ref> The killing sparked protests and calls for the mayor to resign.<ref name=\":0\" /> A video was released which revealed McDonald walking down a street, carrying a knife.<ref name=\":0\" /> McDonald was walking parallel to the two police cars when he was shot 16 times.<ref name=\":0\" /> A criminal complaint filed in Cook County Circuit Court revealed that Van Dyke was the only officer to shoot,<ref name=\":0\" /> and the complaint also said that McDonald was on PCP at the time of his death.<ref name=\":0\" /> Protestors were frustrated that the video took 13 months to be released.<ref name=\":0\" /> A freelance journalist sued to have the footage released as it was a public record,<ref name=\":0\" /> and a judge found in the reporter's favor and the video became public in November 2015.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVan Dyke was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of official misconduct.<ref name=\":0\" /> He remained on desk duty after the shooting.<ref name=\":0\" /> Van Dyke had a history of complaints in his career but was cleared in a majority of the cases.<ref name=\":0\" /> He pleaded not guilty on December 29, 2015, to the charges against him.<ref name=\":0\" /> After his arraignment, his attorney, Daniel Herbert, said that he would be looking for evidence to clear his client's name.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2017 Department of Justice report and agreement for enforcement==\nFollowing the McDonald shooting, Illinois State Attorney General [[Lisa Madigan]] requested that the US Department of Justice conduct a civil rights investigation of the Chicago Police Department.
