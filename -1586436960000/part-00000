{"title_page": "Poems in Prose (Wilde collection)", "text_new": "[[File:WRCLIT76305.jpg|thumb|Privately Printed [by Charles Carrington], 1905.]]\n{{italic title}}\n{{for|the work of the same name by Clark Ashton Smith|Poems in Prose (Smith collection)}}\n'''''Poems in Prose''''' is the collective title of six [[prose poem]]s published by [[Oscar Wilde]] in ''[[Fortnightly Review|The Fortnightly Review]]'' (July 1894).<ref>Oscar Wilde, ''Poems in Prose'', in ''The Fortnightly Review'' (July 1894), pp. 22\u201329</ref>  Derived from Wilde's many oral tales, these prose poems are the only six that were published by Wilde in his lifetime, and they include (in order of appearance): \"The Artist,\" \"The Doer of Good\", \"The Disciple,\" \"The Master,\" \"The House of Judgment,\" and \"The Teacher of Wisdom.\"  Two of these prose poems, \"The House of Judgment\" and \"The Disciple,\" appeared earlier in ''The Spirit Lamp'', an Oxford undergraduate magazine, on 17 February and 6 June 1893 respectively.  A set of illustrations for the prose poems was completed by Wilde's friend and frequent illustrator, [[Charles Ricketts]], who never published the pen-and-ink drawings in his lifetime.\n\n==Form and influences==\n\nAccording to ''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', the defining traits of the prose poem are \"unity even in brevity and poetic quality even without the line breaks of free verse: high patterning, rhythmic and figural repetition, sustained intensity, and compactness.\"<ref>Alex Preminger and T. V. F. Brogan, co-editors, ''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993), p. xlvi</ref>  Invented in the nineteenth century, the modern prose poem form is largely indebted to [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s experiments in the genre, notably in his ''[[Petits po\u00e8mes en prose]]'' (1869), which created the subsequent interest in France exemplified by later writers such as [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].  In English literature, [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Charles Kingsley]] were progenitors of the form.\n\n==Summaries==\n\n*The Artist\n\nIn this prose poem, an artist is filled with the desire to create an image of \"The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment.\"  Able to fashion this image out of bronze only, he searches the world for the metal but all he can find is the bronze of one of his earlier pieces, \"The Sorrow that endureth for Ever.\"  The prose poem ends with the artist melting down his earlier creation to create his sculpture of \"The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment.\"  \n\n*The Doer of Good\n\nThis tale narrates the lives of four individuals after they have been helped by Christ.  Noticing a man who is living exorbitantly, Christ asks him why he is living this way, to which the man replies that he was a leper and Christ healed him: how else should he live?  Seeing another man lusting after a prostitute, Christ asks this man why he looks at the women in that way, to which he replies that he was blind but now can see: at what else should he look?  Christ turns to the woman, and asks her, too, why she is living in sin: you have forgiven me my sins, she says in turn.  Lastly, Christ comes upon a man weeping by the roadside.  When Christ asks why he is weeping, the man replies: I was raised from the dead, so what else should I do but weep?\n\n*The Disciple\n\nThis story is told from the perspective of the reflection pool in which Narcissus gazed at himself.  Beginning immediately after Narcissus' death, the prose poem captures the [[Oreads]] and the pool grieving for the loss of Narcissus.  Seeing that the pool has become a \"cup of salt tears,\" the Oreads try to console the pool, saying that it must be hard not to mourn for someone so beautiful.  The pool, however, confesses that it did not know Narcissus was beautiful; instead, it admits that it is mourning because its own beauty was reflected in Narcissus' eyes.  \n\"The Disciple\" is used by [[Paulo Coelho]] as the basis for his prologue to ''[[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]]''.\n\n\t\n*The Master\n\nJoseph of Arimathea comes upon a weeping man, who he mistakenly thinks is mourning because of Christ's crucifixion. Instead, the man confesses that he is grieving because, in spite of performing the same miracles as Christ performed, no one has crucified him.  \n\n*The House of Judgment\n\nStanding before God in the House of Judgment, a sinner listens to God read the list of his sins.  After each catalogue of sins, the man replies that he has done those things of which he is accused.  God, then, sentences the man to Hell, but the sinner replies that he has always lived there.  God, then, sentences the man to go to Heaven, but the man responds by saying that in no way could he ever imagine Heaven.  Stumped by the man's replies, God must remain silent.\n\n*The Teacher of Wisdom\n\nA disciple preaches the gospel to the multitudes but finds that he remains unhappy.  The man's soul warns him that he is dividing his treasure by giving away his knowledge of God, after which the man hoards his remaining knowledge and makes shelter in a cave in which a [[Centaur]] had lived.  Having lived in the cave for some while, the hermit encounters a robber passing by one day.

A set of illustrations for the prose poems was completed by Wilde's friend and frequent illustrator, [[Charles Ricketts]], who never published the pen-and-ink drawings in his lifetime.\n\n==Form and influences==\n\nAccording to ''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', the defining traits of the prose poem are \"unity even in brevity and poetic quality even without the line breaks of free verse: high patterning, rhythmic and figural repetition, sustained intensity, and compactness.\"<ref>Alex Preminger and T. V. F. Brogan, co-editors, ''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993), p. xlvi</ref>  Invented in the nineteenth century, the modern prose poem form is largely indebted to [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s experiments in the genre, notably in his ''[[Petits po\u00e8mes en prose]]'' (1869), which created the subsequent interest in France exemplified by later writers such as [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].  In English literature, [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Charles Kingsley]] were progenitors of the form.\n\n==Summaries==\n\n*The Artist\n\nIn this prose poem, an artist is filled with the desire to create an image of \"The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment.\"  Able to fashion this image out of bronze only, he searches the world for the metal but all he can find is the bronze of one of his earlier pieces, \"The Sorrow that endureth for Ever.\"  The prose poem ends with the artist melting down his earlier creation to create his sculpture of \"The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment.\"  \n\n*The Doer of Good\n\nThis tale narrates the lives of four individuals after they have been helped by Christ.  Noticing a man who is living exorbitantly, Christ asks him why he is living this way, to which the man replies that he was a leper and Christ healed him: how else should he live?  Seeing another man lusting after a prostitute, Christ asks this man why he looks at the women in that way, to which he replies that he was blind but now can see: at what else should he look?  Christ turns to the woman, and asks her, too, why she is living in sin: you have forgiven me my sins, she says in turn.  Lastly, Christ comes upon a man weeping by the roadside.  When Christ asks why he is weeping, the man replies: I was raised from the dead, so what else should I do but weep?\n\n*The Disciple\n\nThis story is told from the perspective of the reflection pool in which Narcissus gazed at himself.  Beginning immediately after Narcissus' death, the prose poem captures the [[Oreads]] and the pool grieving for the loss of Narcissus.  Seeing that the pool has become a \"cup of salt tears,\" the Oreads try to console the pool, saying that it must be hard not to mourn for someone so beautiful.  The pool, however, confesses that it did not know Narcissus was beautiful; instead, it admits that it is mourning because its own beauty was reflected in Narcissus' eyes.  \n\"The Disciple\" is used by [[Paulo Coelho]] as the basis for his prologue to ''[[The Alchemist]]''.\n\n\t\n*The Master\n\nJoseph of Arimathea comes upon a weeping man, who he mistakenly thinks is mourning because of Christ's crucifixion. Instead, the man confesses that he is grieving because, in spite of performing the same miracles as Christ performed, no one has crucified him.  \n\n*The House of Judgment\n\nStanding before God in the House of Judgment, a sinner listens to God read the list of his sins.  After each catalogue of sins, the man replies that he has done those things of which he is accused.  God, then, sentences the man to Hell, but the sinner replies that he has always lived there.  God, then, sentences the man to go to Heaven, but the man responds by saying that in no way could he ever imagine Heaven.  Stumped by the man's replies, God must remain silent.\n\n*The Teacher of Wisdom\n\nA disciple preaches the gospel to the multitudes but finds that he remains unhappy.  The man's soul warns him that he is dividing his treasure by giving away his knowledge of God, after which the man hoards his remaining knowledge and makes shelter in a cave in which a [[Centaur]] had lived.  Having lived in the cave for some while, the hermit encounters a robber passing by one day.  The robber is arrested by the hermit's glare, which the latter says is a look of pity because he has treasure more valuable than all of the robber's stolen goods.  The robber threatens the hermit, but the hermit will not give away his knowledge until the robber threatens to sell his stolen treasure for the pleasures of the city.  Finally, the hermit gives away his remaining knowledge and expires, but is then greeted by God, who tells the man that he will now know the perfect love of God.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*Jackson, Russell, and Ian Small (gen. eds.): ''The complete works of Oscar Wilde'': vol. 1, ''Poems and poems in prose'', ed. by Bobby Fong and Karl Beckson (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000)\n*Serra, Alessandra, \"De-centering myths: postmodernism echoes in Oscar Wilde's poems in prose,\" ''Rivista di studi vittoriani'' 14 (2002), pp.&nbsp;63\u201375\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikisource|Poems in Prose}}\n* [http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2014/09/wilde-poems-in-prose/ Fortnightly Review full 1894 text of the prose poems]\n* {{librivox book | title=Poems in Prose | author=Oscar Wilde}}\n\n{{Oscar Wilde}}\n[[Category:1894 poems]]\n[[Category:Irish poetry collections]]\n[[Category:Poetry by Oscar Wilde]]\n[[Category:Works originally published in Fortnightly Review]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toAlchemist (disambiguation)(link changed toThe Alchemist (novel)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poems_in_Prose_(Wilde_collection)"}

Having received a text from the doppelg\u00e4nger, Diane tells the task force that, years ago, Cooper raped her and took her to an old gas station. Exclaiming \"I'm in the sheriff's station... I'm not me\", she pulls a gun but is shot by Albert and Tammy. Diane is drawn to the Black Lodge and dissolves into a seed. Tammy realizes that the \"Diane\" they had been associating with is actually a tulpa. At the Roadhouse, Audrey dances to \"[[Audrey's Dance]]\". When a fight breaks out, Audrey begs Charlie to take her home. Suddenly she wakes up, confused and looking into a mirror.\n |LineColor       = 445848\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Twin Peaks (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 47\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 17\n |Title           = [[Part 17 (Twin Peaks)|Part 17]]\n |AltTitle        = The Past Dictates the Future\n |DirectedBy      = David Lynch\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Frost & David Lynch\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|9|3}}\n |Viewers         = 0.254<ref name=\"Part 17 & 18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-9-3-2017.html|title=UPDATED: SHOWBUZZDAILY's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 9.3.2017|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=September 6, 2017|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Gordon tells Albert of a secret plan to find \"Judy\", an \"extreme negative force\" originally known as \"Jowday\", and is informed that Cooper is headed for Twin Peaks. The remaining coordinates lead Cooper's doppelg\u00e4nger to \"Jack Rabbit's Palace\". He is transported to the Fireman, then to the Sheriff's Department, and mistaken for the real Cooper. While talking to the doppelg\u00e4nger, Frank receives a call from Cooper. The doppelg\u00e4nger draws a gun but is shot by Lucy. Cooper, the FBI and the Mitchums arrive. Woodsmen tear at the doppelg\u00e4nger's body, releasing BOB's orb. Freddie knocks out Chad, who had escaped his cell, and smashes BOB's orb with several punches. Cooper puts the Owl Cave ring on the doppelg\u00e4nger's finger, sending him to the Black Lodge. Naido transforms into Diane. Cooper unlocks a door at the Great Northern, where MIKE takes him to Jeffries, who transports Cooper to the night Laura died. Cooper prevents Laura's murder; in the morning, her corpse vanishes. As he leads her through the woods, she disappears and a woman's scream is heard. In Sarah's house, Sarah smashes Laura's photo, though the photograph itself cannot be torn.\n |LineColor       = 445848\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Twin Peaks (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 48\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 18\n |Title           = [[Part 18 (Twin Peaks)|Part 18]]\n |AltTitle        = What Is Your Name?\n |DirectedBy      = David Lynch\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Frost & David Lynch\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|9|3}}\n |Viewers         = 0.240<ref name=\"Part 17 & 18\"/>\n |ShortSummary    = Cooper's doppelg\u00e4nger burns in the Black Lodge.

They drive on a highway for 430 miles and \"cross over\" an electrical field, then drive to a motel and have sex. Cooper wakes the next morning alone and finds a note left to \"Richard\" from \"Linda\". Arriving at Judy's Diner in [[Odessa, Texas]], Cooper saves a waitress from harassment and obtains the address of another waitress, Carrie Page, who resembles Laura Palmer. Believing she is Laura, he drives her to Twin Peaks, but finds the Palmer house occupied by different owners. Confused, Cooper asks Carrie what year it is. Carrie hears Sarah calling Laura's name and screams. The house lights go out.

There were few advocates for decolonisation of Hong Kong from the British rule during the post-war period, notably [[Ma Man-fai]] and the [[Democratic Self-Government Party of Hong Kong]] in the 1960s but the fruitless movement ceased to exist without substantial support.\n\nIn the last years of the 1970s into the early 1980s, the question of Hong Kong sovereignty emerged on Hong Kong's political scene as the end of the New Territories lease was approaching. Hong Kong and [[Macau]] were both removed from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], in which territories on the list would have the right to be independent, on 2 November 1972 by request of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Although there were advocates for Hong Kong independence, the majority of the Hong Kong population, many of whom were political, economic or war refugees from the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the Communist regime on the mainland China, wished to maintain the status quo. The request for a Hong Kong representative in the Sino-British negotiation was rejected by Beijing. In 1984, the British and Chinese governments signed the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] which stated that the sovereignty of Hong Kong should be transferred to the PRC on 1 July 1997, and Hong Kong should enjoy a \"high degree of autonomy\" under the \"[[One Country, Two Systems]]\" principle.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1997, Hong Kong saw an exodus of emigrants to overseas countries, especially in the wake of the 1989 [[Tiananmen Square crackdown]], which more than a million Hongkongers showed up on the streets to support to student protesters in Beijing. The Tiananmen massacre of 1989 strengthened anti-Beijing sentiments and also led to the emergence of the local democracy movement, which demanded a faster pace of [[democratisation]] before and after 1997.\n\n===Early SAR era===\n{{see also|Democratic development in Hong Kong|Localism in Hong Kong}}\nSince 1997, the implementation of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45]] and Article 68, which states that the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] (CE) and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) should be chosen by [[universal suffrage]], has dominated the political agenda in Hong Kong. The [[pro-democracy camp]], one of the two largest political alignments in the territory, has called for the early implementation of the universal suffrage since the 1980s. After [[Hong Kong 1 July marches#2003|more than 500,000 people protested]] against the legislation of national security law as stipulated in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Basic Law Article 23]] on 1 July 2003, the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) in April 2004 ruled out universal suffrage before 2012.<ref name=yeung2008>{{cite book |isbn=978-9622098824 |last=Yeung |first=Rikkie |title=Moving Millions: The Commercial Success and Political Controversies of Hong Kong |publisher=University of Hong kong Press |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nSince 2003, Beijing's growing encroachment has led Hong Kong to become increasingly integrated as part of China.

The [[2014 NPCSC decision]] triggered a historic 79-day protest which was dubbed as the \"[[Umbrella Revolution]]\". The failure of the campaign for a free and genuine democratic process strengthened the pro-independence discourse, as it was viewed as a failure of the \"One Country, Two Systems\" and an independent state would be the only way out.

Any advocacy for Hong Kong separating from China has no legal basis.<ref name=\"geographic\"/>\n\n* Same cultural origin and close connection: Hong Kong has been part of China for most of its history. The majority of the people in Hong Kong are of Chinese origin which their parents or themselves migrated from the Mainland; even some of the pro-independence activists such as [[Edward Leung]] were born in mainland China. Most of Hong Kong culture originates from Mainland China and is closely connected with Chinese history and culture.<ref name=\"geographic\"/>\n\n* Benefits from China's growth: The economic growth and integration of Hong Kong and China have largely been mutually beneficial. China has become the crucial factor of Hong Kong's continuing economic growth and also the largest trading partner of Hong Kong. As the center of [[Renminbi]] overseas market, Hong Kong can continue to benefit from the growth of China and its [[potential superpower]] status.\n\n* \"One Country, Two Systems\": Hong Kong, along with Macau,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/88/23/dc/en/|title=Joint declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Portugal on the question of Macao|last=FNunes|website=bo.io.gov.mo|access-date=2016-12-23}}</ref> are the only territories in the People's Republic of China to supposedly enjoy a \"high degree of autonomy\" and freedom under the \"[[One Country, Two Systems]]\" principle as guaranteed by the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and the Hong Kong Basic Law. It is the system that can serve the best interest of Hong Kong people and safeguard Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, as well as individual liberties and the territory's autonomy in the long term if it is implemented properly.\n\n* Practicality: Hong Kong is surrounded by Chinese territories (both land and maritime) and lacks natural resources.  It currently relies on China in terms of food (>90% imported, including nearly all meat, vegetable and rice<ref>{{cite web|url=https://modernfarmer.com/2013/08/hong-kong-imports-over-90-of-its-food-can-it-learn-to-grow/|title=Hong Kong Imports Over 90% of Its Food.

The Beijing government's [[Anti-Secession Law|zero tolerance on any secessionist movement]] also means that any move toward independence could mean war and bloodshed.  The social stability and economic prosperity Hong Kong people have enjoyed for many years will have to be sacrificed.  The probability of Hong Kong people achieving independence via violent means is very low, as Hong Kong separatists \u2014 while capable of organizing street violence \u2014 have no combat-capable armed forces.  In contrast, China commands the [[People's Liberation Army|largest standing army in the world]] and the 10,000-strong [[People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison]] is based directly in Hong Kong across numerous barracks.\n\n* Counterproductive to the democratic cause: The call for independence would \"dilute support\" for democracy as the issue of independence would mix up with and draw attention from the case for democracy.  Any attempt to reject Article 1 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] will mean nullify any previous promise from Beijing to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and would lead to direct retaliation and possible territorial annexation by the Chinese government.  Turning activism for democracy into a [[secessionist]] challenge to Chinese sovereignty would certainly be at the expenses of the long-term autonomy and civil liberties of the Hong Kong people.<ref name=\"Patten\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Localism in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Hong Kong\u2013Mainland China conflict]]\n* [[Macau independence]]\n* [[Taiwan independence movement]]\n* [[Tibetan independence movement]]\n* [[East Turkestan independence movement]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Hong Kong topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hong Kong Independence Movement}}\n[[Category:Hong Kong independence movement| ]]\n[[Category:Politics of Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Localism in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Separatism in China]]\n[[Category:Independence movements]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Political Movement for Hong Kong's Independence from China}}\n{{Distinguish|Hong Kong Autonomy Movement}}\n{{Update|date=January 2020}}\n{{EngvarB|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Politics of Hong Kong}}\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|order=\n|showflag=\n|t=\u9999\u6e2f\u7368\u7acb\n|j=Hoeng<sup>1</sup> gong<sup>2</sup> duk<sup>6</sup> laap<sup>6</sup> \n|y=H\u0113ungg\u00f3ng duhklahp\n}}\n\n'''Hong Kong independence''' ({{zh-t|\u9999\u6e2f\u7368\u7acb}}) is a [[political movement]] that advocates for the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]].

There were few advocates for decolonisation of Hong Kong from the British rule during the post-war period, notably [[Ma Man-fai]] and the [[Democratic Self-Government Party of Hong Kong]] in the 1960s but the fruitless movement ceased to exist without substantial support.\n\nIn the last years of the 1970s into the early 1980s, the question of Hong Kong sovereignty emerged on Hong Kong's political scene as the end of the New Territories lease was approaching. Hong Kong and [[Macau]] were both removed from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], in which territories on the list would have the right to be independent, on 2 November 1972 by request of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Although there were advocates for Hong Kong independence, the majority of the Hong Kong population, many of whom were political, economic or war refugees from the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the Communist regime on the mainland China, wished to maintain the status quo. The request for a Hong Kong representative in the Sino-British negotiation was rejected by Beijing. In 1984, the British and Chinese governments signed the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] which stated that the sovereignty of Hong Kong should be transferred to the PRC on 1 July 1997, and Hong Kong should enjoy a \"high degree of autonomy\" under the \"[[One Country, Two Systems]]\" principle.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1997, Hong Kong saw an exodus of emigrants to overseas countries, especially in the wake of the 1989 [[Tiananmen Square crackdown]], which more than a million Hongkongers showed up on the streets to support to student protesters in Beijing. The Tiananmen massacre of 1989 strengthened anti-Beijing sentiments and also led to the emergence of the local democracy movement, which demanded a faster pace of [[democratisation]] before and after 1997.\n\n===Early SAR era===\n{{see also|Democratic development in Hong Kong|Localism in Hong Kong}}\nSince 1997, the implementation of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45]] and Article 68, which states that the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] (CE) and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) should be chosen by [[universal suffrage]], has dominated the political agenda in Hong Kong.

It is also a serious violation of the country's constitution, Hong Kong's Basic Law and the relevant existing laws.\"<ref name=\"slam\"/> The spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office stated that \"[Beijing] will absolutely neither permit anyone advocating secession in Hong Kong nor allow any pro-independence activists to enter a government institution,\" after the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) interpret the Article 104 of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]] which aimed to disqualify the two [[Youngspiration]] legislators [[Baggio Leung]] and [[Yau Wai-ching]].<ref name=\"bar\"/> On the universities' independence banner row, a commentary titled \"A rule must be set to make Hong Kong independence criminal\" published on the state-owned ''[[People's Daily]]'' overseas edition website said the discussion on Hong Kong independence should be made illegal, just like it is illegal to promote Nazism in Germany.<ref name=\"nazi\"/>\n\nThe Hong Kong government issued a statement after the formation of the Hong Kong National Party, stating that \"any suggestion that Hong Kong should be independent or any movement to advocate such 'independence' is against the Basic Law, and will undermine the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and impair the interest of the general public\u2026 The SAR Government will take action according to the law.\"<ref name=\"slam\"/>\n\n===Political parties===\nThe [[pro-Beijing camp]] holds the same stance with the Beijing and SAR government and strongly opposes Hong Kong independence. The mainstream [[pan-democracy camp]] sympathised with the pro-independence cause but generally opposes Hong Kong independence as they do not think it would be beneficial to Hong Kong, nor practical or achievable.<ref name=\"geographic\"/> They believe that to fight for genuine democracy and safeguard the high degree of autonomy under the \"[[One Country, Two Systems]]\" principle is the most foreseeable solution.\n\nAlthough politicians and scholars like [[Chin Wan]], [[Wong Yuk-man]] and [[Civic Passion]]'s [[Wong Yeung-tat]] are seen as leading [[localism in Hong Kong|localist]] figures and have been close to the Hong Kong independence movement and even had advocated \"nation building\", they have also cut clear that they do not support Hong Kong independence during the midst of the [[Hong Kong LegCo candidates' disqualification controversy]]. They claim they fight for an amendment of the Basic Law through civil referendum to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy similar to that of [[Greenland]]'s.<ref name=\"CPPPIHKRO\"/>\n\n===Others===\nThe last [[Governor of Hong Kong|British colonial governor]] [[Chris Patten]] opposes Hong Kong independence, worrying such activists would \"dilute support\" for democracy in Hong Kong: \"[i]t would be dishonest, dishonourable and reckless of somebody like me, to pretend that the case for democracy should be mixed up with an argument about the independence of Hong Kong \u2013 something which is not going to happen, something which dilutes support for democracy, and something which has led to all sorts of antics which should not take place in a mature society aiming to be a full democracy.\"<ref name=\"Patten\">{{cite news|title=Chris Patten warns Hong Kong pro-independence antics 'dilute support' for democracy |first=Tony |last=Cheung |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2049247/chris-patten-slams-disqualified-localist-duo-saying-hong |date=25 November 2016|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2017, ten university heads in Hong Kong, [[City University of Hong Kong]], [[Hong Kong Baptist University]], [[Hong Kong Shue Yan University]], [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]], the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the [[Education University of Hong Kong]], the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]], the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]], the [[Open University of Hong Kong]] and the [[University of Hong Kong]] stated that all the universities do not support Hong Kong independence as it contravenes the Basic Law.<ref name=\"uniheads\"/>\n\n===Reasons===\nReasons cited in favor of maintaining Hong Kong as part of China include:\n* Legality: Article 1 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] states that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China.  Any advocacy for Hong Kong separating from China has no legal basis.<ref name=\"geographic\"/>\n\n* Same cultural origin and close connection: Hong Kong has been part of China for most of its history. The majority of the people in Hong Kong are of Chinese origin which their parents or themselves migrated from the Mainland; even some of the pro-independence activists such as [[Edward Leung]] were born in mainland China. Most of Hong Kong culture originates from Mainland China and is closely connected with Chinese history and culture.<ref name=\"geographic\"/>\n\n* Benefits from China's growth: The economic growth and integration of Hong Kong and China have largely been mutually beneficial. China has become the crucial factor of Hong Kong's continuing economic growth and also the largest trading partner of Hong Kong. As the center of [[Renminbi]] overseas market, Hong Kong can continue to benefit from the growth of China and its [[potential superpower]] status.\n\n* \"One Country, Two Systems\": Hong Kong, along with Macau,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/88/23/dc/en/|title=Joint declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Portugal on the question of Macao|last=FNunes|website=bo.io.gov.mo|access-date=2016-12-23}}</ref> are the only territories in the People's Republic of China to supposedly enjoy a \"high degree of autonomy\" and freedom under the \"[[One Country, Two Systems]]\" principle as guaranteed by the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and the Hong Kong Basic Law. It is the system that can serve the best interest of Hong Kong people and safeguard Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, as well as individual liberties and the territory's autonomy in the long term if it is implemented properly.\n\n* Practicality: Hong Kong is surrounded by Chinese territories (both land and maritime) and lacks natural resources.  It currently relies on China in terms of food (>90% imported, including nearly all meat, vegetable and rice<ref>{{cite web|url=https://modernfarmer.com/2013/08/hong-kong-imports-over-90-of-its-food-can-it-learn-to-grow/|title=Hong Kong Imports Over 90% of Its Food. Can It Learn to Grow?|author=Daniel Kong|publisher=Modern Farmer|date=2013-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/827508/hong-kong-now-imports-nearly-every-single-thing-it-eats/|title=Hong Kong now imports nearly every single thing it eats|author= Echo Huang|publisher=Quartz|date=2016-11-16}}</ref>), [[water supply and sanitation in Hong Kong|fresh water]], [[electricity sector in Hong Kong|electricity]] and [[energy in Hong Kong|fuel]] supplies, and it is claimed that Hong Kong will not be self-sufficient without [[mainland China]].  The Beijing government's [[Anti-Secession Law|zero tolerance on any secessionist movement]] also means that any move toward independence could mean war and bloodshed.  The social stability and economic prosperity Hong Kong people have enjoyed for many years will have to be sacrificed.  The probability of Hong Kong people achieving independence via violent means is very low, as Hong Kong separatists \u2014 while capable of organizing street violence \u2014 have no combat-capable armed forces.  In contrast, China commands the [[People's Liberation Army|largest standing army in the world]] and the 10,000-strong [[People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison]] is based directly in Hong Kong across numerous barracks.\n\n* Counterproductive to the democratic cause: The call for independence would \"dilute support\" for democracy as the issue of independence would mix up with and draw attention from the case for democracy.  Any attempt to reject Article 1 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] will mean nullify any previous promise from Beijing to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and would lead to direct retaliation and possible territorial annexation by the Chinese government.  Turning activism for democracy into a [[secessionist]] challenge to Chinese sovereignty would certainly be at the expenses of the long-term autonomy and civil liberties of the Hong Kong people.<ref name=\"Patten\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Localism in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Hong Kong\u2013Mainland China conflict]]\n* [[Macau independence]]\n* [[Taiwan independence movement]]\n* [[Tibetan independence movement]]\n* [[East Turkestan independence movement]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Hong Kong topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hong Kong Independence Movement}}\n[[Category:Hong Kong independence movement| ]]\n[[Category:Politics of Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Localism in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Separatism in China]]\n[[Category:Independence movements]]\n", "name_user": "2600:8800:6980:2a20:ac30:7b1f:4760:5f58", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_independence"}
