The film was co-produced by [[Siddharth Roy Kapur]], [[Ronnie Screwvala]] and [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] under their production companies of [[RSVP Movies]], Roy Kapur Films and [[Purple Pebble Pictures]] in association with Ivanhoe Pictures. The film stars Chopra Jonas, [[Farhan Akhtar]], [[Zaira Wasim]], and [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]]. Based on the real life story of [[Aisha Chaudhary]] who was diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], the film tells the love story of her parents, Aditi and Niren, dealing with their daughter's illness.\n\nAditi Chaudhary approached Bose to make a film based on her daughter. Although intrigued by the story, Bose instead chose to depict the story of the couple from Aisha's point of view, focusing on their marriage and the effect of a child's illness on the lives of the parents and their relationship. Bose wrote the screenplay based on the details she gathered through interviewing Aditi and Niren. Nilesh Maniyar wrote the additional screenplay while the Hindi dialogue were written by [[Juhi Chaturvedi]]. Filming took place in Mumbai, London, Delhi and [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. [[Pritam]] composed the soundtrack and [[Gulzar]] wrote the lyrics for the songs.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[44th Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2019. It was released worldwide on 11 October 2019. ''The Sky Is Pink'' received generally positive reviews, with praise directed towards Bose's writing and direction and the performances. It did not perform well at the box office, grossing {{INR}}34.41 crore worldwide. The film received three [[Filmfare Awards]] nominations: [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film (Critics)]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Chopra Jonas and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Wasim.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Aisha Chaudhary]] narrates the story of her parents, Moose (her mother) and Panda (her father) from [[afterlife]]. Aditi and Niren are a young couple who come from two different backgrounds. Aditi is from the posh end of the town, [[South Delhi]], where on another hand Niren is from a grounded middle-class family. The couple are shown to be in love, with \"an active sex life\" as Aisha's narration describes. The passionate and happy couple get married, and Aditi becomes pregnant with their first child Tanya, who dies within months of her birth due to the [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] condition. Baby Tanya used to frequently become ill and, while Aditi was convinced it was a serious issue, Niren used to brush it off. Niren believed that negligence was the reason Tanya couldn't be treated sooner and blamed himself for the death of his child. As Aditi was mourning the death of her child, she was consoled by a Catholic church nun and decided to be baptised.\n\nAditi and Niren have a second child Ishaan. A few years later, Aditi bore their third child, another daughter, Aisha. They later learn that Aisha was born with the same Severe combined immunodeficiency condition as their first child, Aditi and Niren are heartbroken. After the doctors in Delhi give up on the treatment, the couple go to London where they learn that the disease could be treated by performing [[bone marrow transplant]]. However, they learn that the treatment is very costly. Niren starts working to earn the money while also asking for crowdfunding via a radio station. After several weeks, they learn that several people have donated money for Aisha's treatment. The surgery is successful but Aisha is kept under doctor's watch. Aditi decides to stay in London while Niren goes back to India with his family and his son Ishaan. Aditi grows overprotective of Aisha, over cleaning the apartment and other things to keep Aisha away from any potential infection.\n\nIshaan starts missing his mother while Niren is always thinking about Aditi and Aisha. This also starts affecting Aditi and Niren's relationship as Aditi is always occupied with Aisha and taking care of her. Months go by and Niren goes to London and asks Aditi to move back to India so that their relationship is not affected. He reasons with Aisha on the grounds that Aisha had gotten better and occasional doctor's visit can be done in India as well. Aditi tells him that they have to live here for a very long time as per doctor's recommendation till Aisha's condition is cured. The whole family moves here permanently till Aisha is cured. Niren's career grows in London and he becomes rich and their family becomes affluent.\n\nSeveral years later, Aisha has finally gotten better and Niren and Aditi decide to move back to India with their families. They shift to the outskirts of Delhi and buy an extravagant and massive bungalow. After a doctor's visit, Aditi and Niren learn that Aisha has been diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], a side effect of the chemotherapy that was done to cure the previous disease. With less time on Aisha's life, Aditi sets out to fulfill all of Aisha's dreams such as adopting a pet (which Aditi did not allow due to the risk of infection), seeing the aquatic life and writing a book, among other things. As Aisha's condition worsens, Aditi grows more and more overprotective and due to over stress, suffers a psychotic breakdown and is hospitalized. Aditi does everything in her power to make sure Aisha gets to see the first copy of her book before she dies. Later, Aisha passes away.\n\nAfter the death of Aisha, Aditi and Niren's relationship is strained. While living together, they grow apart and are constantly fighting with each other. Aditi still cannot accept Aisha's death and constantly brings her in their fights. At a party, Niren shows Aisha's secret video that he had found, a video she had made about her parents. Niren wants Aditi to move with him to London so that she can forget Aisha which she finds insulting as she does not want to let Aisha's memories fade, particularly the house. With anger, Niren leaves for London while Aditi stays back. Aditi later goes to meet Niren in London and they reconcile.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast has been listed below:<ref name=\"cast&crew\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/the-sky-is-pink/cast/ |title=The Sky Is Pink Cast & Crew |work=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] as Aditi Chaudhary\n* [[Farhan Akhtar]] as Niren Chaudhary\n* [[Zaira Wasim]] as [[Aisha Chaudhary]]\n* [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]] as Ishaan Chaudhary\n* Vidhaan Sharma as Young Ishaan\n* Manas Mittal as Anshu Tandon\n* Rajshri Deshpande as Anita Tandon\n* Lushin Dubey as Mrs. Tandon\n* Sunil Chitkara as Mr. Chaudhary\n* Nirupama Verma as Mrs. Chaudhary\n* Puja Sarup as Mohini\n* Gurpal Singh as Rj Arjun Gill\n* Sheena Khalid as Rita\n* Sudhanva Deshpande as Dr. Nirvick Gulati\n* Manisha Chudasama as Santoshi\n* Paras Rattan Sharda as Jeet\n* Salmin Sheriff as Dr. Batliwala\n* Rishi Deshpande as Tanya's Doctor\n* Virhi as Baby Tanya\n* Mala Hashmi as Christian Woman\n* Akshay Joshi as Store Assistant\n* Nargis Nandal as Pilot\n* Raabia Marici as Ishaan's Girlfriend\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\nThe production of the film started when [[Aisha Chaudhary]]'s mother Aditi approached [[Shonali Bose]] to make a film about her daughter.

The film was co-produced by [[Siddharth Roy Kapur]], [[Ronnie Screwvala]] and [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] under their production companies of [[RSVP Movies]], Roy Kapur Films and [[Purple Pebble Pictures]] in association with Ivanhoe Pictures. The film stars Chopra Jonas, [[Farhan Akhtar]], [[Zaira Wasim]], and [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]]. Based on the real life story of [[Aisha Chaudhary]] who was diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], the film tells the love story of her parents, Aditi and Niren, dealing with their daughter's illness.\n\nAditi Chaudhary approached Bose to make a film based on her daughter. Although intrigued by the story, Bose instead chose to depict the story of the couple from Aisha's point of view, focusing on their marriage and the effect of a child's illness on the lives of the parents and their relationship. Bose wrote the screenplay based on the details she gathered through interviewing Aditi and Niren. Nilesh Maniyar wrote the additional screenplay while the Hindi dialogue were written by [[Juhi Chaturvedi]]. Filming took place in Mumbai, London, Delhi and [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. [[Pritam]] composed the soundtrack and [[Gulzar]] wrote the lyrics for the songs.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[44th Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2019. It was released worldwide on 11 October 2019. ''The Sky Is Pink'' received generally positive reviews, with praise directed towards Bose's writing and direction and the performances. It did not perform well at the box office, grossing {{INR}}34.41 crore worldwide. The film received three [[Filmfare Awards]] nominations: [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film (Critics)]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Chopra Jonas and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Wasim.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Aisha Chaudhary]] narrates the story of her parents, Moose (her mother) and Panda (her father) from [[afterlife]]. Aditi and Niren are a young couple who come from two different backgrounds. Aditi is from the posh end of the town, [[South Delhi]], where on another hand Niren is from a grounded middle-class family. The couple are shown to be in love, with \"an active sex life\" as Aisha's narration describes. The passionate and happy couple get married, and Aditi becomes pregnant with their first child Tanya, who dies within months of her birth due to the [[Severe combined immunodeficiency]] condition. Baby Tanya used to frequently become ill and, while Aditi was convinced it was a serious issue, Niren used to brush it off. Niren believed that negligence was the reason Tanya couldn't be treated sooner and blamed himself for the death of his child. As Aditi was mourning the death of her child, she was consoled by a Catholic church nun and decided to be baptised.\n\nAditi and Niren have a second child Ishaan. A few years later, Aditi bore their third child, another daughter, Aisha. They later learn that Aisha was born with the same Severe combined immunodeficiency condition as their first child, Aditi and Niren are heartbroken. After the doctors in Delhi give up on the treatment, the couple go to London where they learn that the disease could be treated by performing [[bone marrow transplant]]. However, they learn that the treatment is very costly. Niren starts working to earn the money while also asking for crowdfunding via a radio station. After several weeks, they learn that several people have donated money for Aisha's treatment. The surgery is successful but Aisha is kept under doctor's watch. Aditi decides to stay in London while Niren goes back to India with his family and his son Ishaan. Aditi grows overprotective of Aisha, over cleaning the apartment and other things to keep Aisha away from any potential infection.\n\nIshaan starts missing his mother while Niren is always thinking about Aditi and Aisha. This also starts affecting Aditi and Niren's relationship as Aditi is always occupied with Aisha and taking care of her. Months go by and Niren goes to London and asks Aditi to move back to India so that their relationship is not affected. He reasons with Aisha on the grounds that Aisha had gotten better and occasional doctor's visit can be done in India as well. Aditi tells him that they have to live here for a very long time as per doctor's recommendation till Aisha's condition is cured. The whole family moves here permanently till Aisha is cured. Niren's career grows in London and he becomes rich and their family becomes affluent.\n\nSeveral years later, Aisha has finally gotten better and Niren and Aditi decide to move back to India with their families. They shift to the outskirts of Delhi and buy an extravagant and massive bungalow. After a doctor's visit, Aditi and Niren learn that Aisha has been diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], a side effect of the chemotherapy that was done to cure the previous disease. With less time on Aisha's life, Aditi sets out to fulfill all of Aisha's dreams such as adopting a pet (which Aditi did not allow due to the risk of infection), seeing the aquatic life and writing a book, among other things. As Aisha's condition worsens, Aditi grows more and more overprotective and due to over stress, suffers a psychotic breakdown and is hospitalized. Aditi does everything in her power to make sure Aisha gets to see the first copy of her book before she dies. Later, Aisha passes away.\n\nAfter the death of Aisha, Aditi and Niren's relationship is strained. While living together, they grow apart and are constantly fighting with each other. Aditi still cannot accept Aisha's death and constantly brings her in their fights. At a party, Niren shows Aisha's secret video that he had found, a video she had made about her parents. Niren wants Aditi to move with him to London so that she can forget Aisha which she finds insulting as she does not want to let Aisha's memories fade, particularly the house. With anger, Niren leaves for London while Aditi stays back. Aditi later goes to meet Niren in London and they reconcile.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast has been listed below:<ref name=\"cast&crew\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/the-sky-is-pink/cast/ |title=The Sky Is Pink Cast & Crew |work=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] as Aditi Chaudhary\n* [[Farhan Akhtar]] as Niren Chaudhary\n* [[Zaira Wasim]] as [[Aisha Chaudhary]]\n* [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]] as Ishaan Chaudhary\n* Vidhaan Sharma as Young Ishaan\n* Manas Mittal as Anshu Tandon\n* Rajshri Deshpande as Anita Tandon\n* Lushin Dubey as Mrs. Tandon\n* Sunil Chitkara as Mr. Chaudhary\n* Nirupama Verma as Mrs. Chaudhary\n* Puja Sarup as Mohini\n* Gurpal Singh as Rj Arjun Gill\n* Sheena Khalid as Rita\n* Sudhanva Deshpande as Dr. Nirvick Gulati\n* Manisha Chudasama as Santoshi\n* Paras Rattan Sharda as Jeet\n* Salmin Sheriff as Dr. Batliwala\n* Rishi Deshpande as Tanya's Doctor\n* Virhi as Baby Tanya\n* Mala Hashmi as Christian Woman\n* Akshay Joshi as Store Assistant\n* Nargis Nandal as Pilot\n* Raabia Marici as Ishaan's Girlfriend\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\nThe production of the film started when [[Aisha Chaudhary]]'s mother Aditi approached [[Shonali Bose]] to make a film about her daughter.
