Its curriculum follows that of the 18th century [[Latin school]] movement, which holds the [[classics]] to be the basis of an educated mind. Four years of Latin are mandatory for all pupils who enter the school in the 7th grade, three years for those who enter in the 9th grade.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Boston Latin Plaque.jpg|Plaque on School Street commemorating the site of the first Boston Latin School building|thumb]]\n\n[[File:BLS HALL OF THE BEDFORD STREET SCHOOL HOUSE.jpg|Hall of the\nBLS School House on Bedford Street, 1844\u20131881|thumb]]\n\nThe Puritans placed a strong emphasis on education for their children in order to read the Bible. Puritan leaders themselves were accustomed to the highest educational standards, with most of their ministers having graduated from [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge University]] in England.

This is a [[double entendre]], referring both to the school's date of founding and its academic stature. Boston Latin has a history of pursuing the same standards as elite [[New England]] [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]] while adopting the egalitarian attitude of a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]. Academically, the school regularly outperforms public schools in affluent Boston suburbs, particularly as measured by the yearly [[Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System|MCAS]] assessment required of all [[Massachusetts]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. In 2006, [[Brooklyn Latin School]] was founded in New York City, explicitly modeled on Boston Latin, borrowing much from its traditions and curriculum.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tracy|last=Jan|title=Growing a Boston Latin in Brooklyn|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/03/04/growing_a_boston_latin_in_brooklyn/|work=Boston Globe|date=March 4, 2006|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref>\n\n===Admissions===\nAdmission is determined by a combination of a student's score on the [[Independent School Entrance Examination]] (ISEE) and recent grades, and is limited to residents of the city of Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.org/doc_content/ISEE%20QUESTIONS.pdf |title=Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Entrance to Boston Latin School |accessdate=2007-12-31 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229063010/http://www.bls.org/doc_content/ISEE%20QUESTIONS.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although Boston Latin runs from the 7th through the 12th grade, it admits students only into the 7th and 9th grades.\n\nBecause it is a high-performing and well-regarded school, Boston Latin has been at the center of controversy concerning its admissions process. Admissions are very competitive, and it is not uncommon for fewer than 20% of applicants to be admitted. Before the 1997 school year, Boston Latin set aside a 35% [[Racial quota|quota]] of places in its incoming class for under-represented minorities. The school was forced to drop this policy after a series of lawsuits involving non-minority girls who were not admitted despite ranking higher than admitted minorities.<ref>See: Wessmann v.

The percentage of under-represented minorities at Boston Latin fell from 35% in 1997 to under 19% in 2005, despite efforts by Boston Latin, the [[Boston Public Schools]], and the Boston Latin School Association to recruit more minority applicants and retain more minority students.\n\n===Curriculum===\n[[Declamation]] is the most time-honored of the school's traditions. Pupils in the 7th through 10th grade are required to give an oration, known as 'Declamation', in their English class three times during the year. There is also Public Declamation, where pupils from all grades, or classes, are welcomed to try out for the chance to declaim a memorized piece in front of an assembly. During Public Declamation, declaimers are scored on aspects such as \"Memorization\" \"Presentation\", and \"Voice and Delivery\", and those who score well in three of the first four public declamations are given the chance to declaim in front of alumni judges for awards in \"Prize Declamation\".\n[[File:Latin Public School.jpg|thumb|Front entrance of the school house on Avenue Louis Pasteur. 2007]]\nIn addition to the well-known and time-honored tradition of declamation in English classes, recently the Modern Languages department instituted an annual \"World Language Declamation\" competition. Once a year, during National Foreign Language Week (usually the first week of March),<ref>Kate Stevenson (2008). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060903084941/http://www.jc.edu/users/stevenso/FLAND/flwk.html National Foreign Language Week]</ref> students from grades 8 through 12 perform orations in languages other than English. Most students choose to declaim in the modern language they are studying, though some choose Latin, Greek, or their native tongue. Judges are brought in from various institutions around the city, and mark the students in similar categories to those used in Public Declamation. Entrants are categorized by level, rather than language, such that all students declaiming at the first-year level of various languages are competing against each other, all students at the second-year level compete against each other, and so on. Students who regularly perform exceptionally well at World Language Declamation are honored at Prize Night with the Celia Gordon Malkiel Prize.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080414065452/http://www.bls.org/doc_content/PrizeSchol.pdf Prizes and Scholarships], ''BLS Web Site''</ref>\n\nIn a move that was controversial among some alumni, the school decided in 2001 to decrease the requirement for students' Latin instruction by one year, starting with the class of 2006.<ref>{{cite news |first=Anand |last=Vaishnav |title=Boston Latin Eases Language Requirement |url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/103/metro/Boston_Latin_eases_language_requirement+.shtml |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=2001-04-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010416232616/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/103/metro/Boston_Latin_eases_language_requirement%2B.shtml |archivedate=April 16, 2001 |accessdate=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The mandatory minimum period of Latin instruction was decreased for students admitted for 7th grade from five years to four years, and for students admitted for 9th grade from four years to three years. This decision was made by the head of the school's Latin department, in recognition of the fact that the requirement was hampering students' ability to take enough courses in important modern subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science and modern languages. However, students can still take Latin courses after their fourth year, in [[AP Latin]] and Latin 5, the latter if there is demand. Greek is additionally an option.\n\nIn a 1789 [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] to his will, Benjamin Franklin established a legacy to fund the Franklin Medals, which are awarded to the school's top-ranking pupils at graduation. The second most prestigious awards, the Dixwell Prizes, are given to pupils excelling in Latin or Greek.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are currently three main publications of the Boston Latin School: ''The Register'' is the school's literary magazine, ''The Argo'' the school newspaper, and ''Catapulta'' is the school science magazine. [[George Santayana]] founded ''The Register'' in 1881 to serve as the school newspaper. Over the years, however, it evolved into a purely literary magazine, publishing prose and poetry written by members of the student body, as well as artwork. There are generally three editors-in-chief, and it is published twice per year. ''The Argo'', the school's newspaper, is far younger, having been founded in 1970 after it was clear that the ''Register'' had become a purely literary magazine.

This is a [[double entendre]], referring both to the school's date of founding and its academic stature. Boston Latin has a history of pursuing the same standards as elite [[New England]] [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]] while adopting the egalitarian attitude of a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]. Academically, the school regularly outperforms public schools in affluent Boston suburbs, particularly as measured by the yearly [[Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System|MCAS]] assessment required of all [[Massachusetts]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. In 2006, [[Brooklyn Latin School]] was founded in New York City, explicitly modeled on Boston Latin, borrowing much from its traditions and curriculum.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tracy|last=Jan|title=Growing a Boston Latin in Brooklyn|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/03/04/growing_a_boston_latin_in_brooklyn/|work=Boston Globe|date=March 4, 2006|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref>\n\n===Admissions===\nAdmission is determined by a combination of a student's score on the [[Independent School Entrance Examination]] (ISEE) and recent grades, and is limited to residents of the city of Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.org/doc_content/ISEE%20QUESTIONS.pdf |title=Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Entrance to Boston Latin School |accessdate=2007-12-31 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229063010/http://www.bls.org/doc_content/ISEE%20QUESTIONS.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although Boston Latin runs from the 7th through the 12th grade, it admits students only into the 7th and 9th grades.\n\nBecause it is a high-performing and well-regarded school, Boston Latin has been at the center of controversy concerning its admissions process. Admissions are very competitive, and it is not uncommon for fewer than 20% of applicants to be admitted. Before the 1997 school year, Boston Latin set aside a 35% [[Racial quota|quota]] of places in its incoming class for under-represented minorities. The school was forced to drop this policy after a series of lawsuits involving non-minority girls who were not admitted despite ranking higher than admitted minorities.<ref>See: Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F. 3d 790 \u2013 Court of Appeals, 1st Circuit 1998 [[s:SARAH P. WESSMANN, p.p.a. HENRY ROBERT WESSMANN, v. ROBERT P.

The percentage of under-represented minorities at Boston Latin fell from 35% in 1997 to under 19% in 2005, despite efforts by Boston Latin, the [[Boston Public Schools]], and the Boston Latin School Association to recruit more minority applicants and retain more minority students.\n\n===Curriculum===\n[[Declamation]] is the most time-honored of the school's traditions. Pupils in the 7th through 10th grade are required to give an oration, known as 'Declamation', in their English class three times during the year. There is also Public Declamation, where pupils from all grades, or classes, are welcomed to try out for the chance to declaim a memorized piece in front of an assembly. During Public Declamation, declaimers are scored on aspects such as \"Memorization\" \"Presentation\", and \"Voice and Delivery\", and those who score well in three of the first four public declamations are given the chance to declaim in front of alumni judges for awards in \"Prize Declamation\".\n[[File:Latin Public School.jpg|thumb|Front entrance of the school house on Avenue Louis Pasteur. 2007]]\nIn addition to the well-known and time-honored tradition of declamation in English classes, recently the Modern Languages department instituted an annual \"World Language Declamation\" competition. Once a year, during National Foreign Language Week (usually the first week of March),<ref>Kate Stevenson (2008). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060903084941/http://www.jc.edu/users/stevenso/FLAND/flwk.html National Foreign Language Week]</ref> students from grades 8 through 12 perform orations in languages other than English. Most students choose to declaim in the modern language they are studying, though some choose Latin, Greek, or their native tongue. Judges are brought in from various institutions around the city, and mark the students in similar categories to those used in Public Declamation. Entrants are categorized by level, rather than language, such that all students declaiming at the first-year level of various languages are competing against each other, all students at the second-year level compete against each other, and so on. Students who regularly perform exceptionally well at World Language Declamation are honored at Prize Night with the Celia Gordon Malkiel Prize.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080414065452/http://www.bls.org/doc_content/PrizeSchol.pdf Prizes and Scholarships], ''BLS Web Site''</ref>\n\nIn a move that was controversial among some alumni, the school decided in 2001 to decrease the requirement for students' Latin instruction by one year, starting with the class of 2006.<ref>{{cite news |first=Anand |last=Vaishnav |title=Boston Latin Eases Language Requirement |url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/103/metro/Boston_Latin_eases_language_requirement+.shtml |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=2001-04-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010416232616/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/103/metro/Boston_Latin_eases_language_requirement%2B.shtml |archivedate=April 16, 2001 |accessdate=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The mandatory minimum period of Latin instruction was decreased for students admitted for 7th grade from five years to four years, and for students admitted for 9th grade from four years to three years. This decision was made by the head of the school's Latin department, in recognition of the fact that the requirement was hampering students' ability to take enough courses in important modern subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science and modern languages. However, students can still take Latin courses after their fourth year, in [[AP Latin]] and Latin 5, the latter if there is demand. Greek is additionally an option.\n\nIn a 1789 [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] to his will, Benjamin Franklin established a legacy to fund the Franklin Medals, which are awarded to the school's top-ranking pupils at graduation. The second most prestigious awards, the Dixwell Prizes, are given to pupils excelling in Latin or Greek.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are currently three main publications of the Boston Latin School: ''The Register'' is the school's literary magazine, ''The Argo'' the school newspaper, and ''Catapulta'' is the school science magazine. [[George Santayana]] founded ''The Register'' in 1881 to serve as the school newspaper. Over the years, however, it evolved into a purely literary magazine, publishing prose and poetry written by members of the student body, as well as artwork. There are generally three editors-in-chief, and it is published twice per year. ''The Argo'', the school's newspaper, is far younger, having been founded in 1970 after it was clear that the ''Register'' had become a purely literary magazine. As of the 2006\u20132007 school year, it is published seven times a year. ''Catapulta'', the science magazine, highlights popular and recent science and technology and is generally published four times a year. The ''Register'', the ''Argo'', and ''Catapulta'' are entirely student-produced, and the \"Argo\" and the \"Register\" have won awards from the New England Scholastic Press Association, while ''Catapulta'' has won awards from the American Scholastic Press Association.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Publications\u2014Argo\n|url=http://bls.org/library/cfml/l3tmpl_archive.cfm?ArchiveID=36\n|work=BLS Web Site\n|accessdate=2007-06-01\n|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20070927034400/http://bls.org/library/cfml/l3tmpl_archive.cfm?ArchiveID=36 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}} Includes scans of first ''Argo'' edition, 1969.\n</ref>\n\nAnother Boston Latin publication is \"BLSA Bulletin\", published by the Boston Latin School Association, whose president is Peter G.

In the spring of 2017, in just its third season as a varsity sport, the girl's lacrosse team made the state tournament for the first time.\n\nIn the winter of 2015, Boston Latin launched its varsity boys fencing as well as varsity girls fencing, the only public school in Boston with fencing.\n\nIn the winter of the academic year 2015\u20132016, the school's varsity fencing team took home the state championship title for the first time ever, with the men's team placing second overall and women's fourth overall.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the spring of 2019, the school's boys varsity volleyball team took home it's first DCL championship title since 2006.\n\n==Performing and Fine Arts==\n\nBoston Latin's Arts Department is among the best in the city, offering courses as well as ensembles for its students to participate in. \n\nThe school offers Visual Art class and a Music Fundamental class for 7th graders as well as a Theatre class for 8th graders for students who are not enrolled in any other form of art. The department also offers higher-level Visual Art classes in the 11th and 12th grades and the option to take AP Art for students who demonstrate proficiency in this discipline. An additional Theatre Studies course can be taken in these grades as well, covering the history and styles of theatrics.\n\nLatin School's Performing Arts provide opportunities for students from the 7th to 12th grade to learn and develop musical technique, as well as learn music theory in a classroom setting through AP Music Theory. The ensembles offered vary from beginner to high-level groups that compete at local and state competitions. Among the Performing Arts students have the option to participate in Chorus, Strings, Band, and Theatre (both in and out of school). The school's Wind Ensemble, Symphonic Band, Concert Strings Orchestra, and Concert Choir have received Gold Medals at MICCA competitions in the past. Extracurricular ensembles such as the Dues Band and Show Choir also compete for medals.\n\nThe Boston Latin School Big Band also competes in the Charles Mingus High School Jazz Festival, as well as the Essentially Ellington competition. Although they have not won the Ellington Competition, the band was one point off from being a Finalist in 2017. The band has been a Finalist in the Mingus Festival in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, winning the Non-Specialized High School category in 2018.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In \"[[Six Meetings Before Lunch]]\", a first-season episode of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', [[Rob Lowe]]'s character [[Sam Seaborn]] mentioned Boston Latin School in a discussion of public school reform and [[school voucher]]s in American public education.

The club's home ground is [[A. Le Coq Arena]].\n\nFounded as Levadia in [[Maardu]] in 1998, the club moved to Tallinn in 2004. The club has played in the Meistriliiga since the [[1999 Meistriliiga|1999 season]] and have never been relegated from the Estonian top division. Levadia have won 9 Meistriliiga titles, a record 9 [[Estonian Cup]]s and 7 [[Estonian Supercup]]s. In 2017, Levadia's first team merged with [[FCI Tallinn]], and became FCI Levadia.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nLevadia was founded on 22 October 1998, when Viktor Levada's Levadia Group O\u00dc became the official sponsor of [[Maardu]] based [[Esiliiga]] club [[FK Maardu|Ol\u00fcmp]], which subsequently changed its name to Levadia. The club won the [[1998 Esiliiga]] and were promoted to the [[Meistriliiga]]. In January 1999, [[Sergei Ratnikov]] was appointed as manager. In 1999, Levadia became the first team to win the Meistriliiga, the [[Estonian Cup]] and the [[Estonian Supercup]] in the same year. Levadia managed to repeat their success by winning another treble in the following year. In the [[2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League]], Levadia defeated [[The New Saints F.C.|Total Network Solutions]] 2\u20136 on aggregate in the first qualifying round, but lost to [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] 2\u20139 on aggregate in the second qualifying round. Following the loss to Shakhtar Donetsk, Ratnikov was sacked.<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web|title=Klubi ajalugu|trans-title=Club history|language=Estonian|publisher=FC Levadia|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427185029/http://www.fclevadia.ee:80/dyna/site/64est.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, [[Valeri Bondarenko]] was appointed as a manager. Levadia failed to defend their title, finishing the [[2001 Meistriliiga|2001 season]] in third place and in November 2001, Bondarenko was replaced by [[Pasi Rautiainen]]. Under Rautiainen, Levadia finished the [[2002 Meistriliiga]] as runners-up, only two points behind champions [[FC Flora|Flora]]. After the season, Rautiainen resigned and was replaced by [[Franco Pancheri]] in January 2003. Pancheri coached Levadia for just 9 Meistriliiga matches, before he was sacked in June 2003. He was replaced by [[Tarmo R\u00fc\u00fctli]] and Levadia finished the [[2003 Meistriliiga|2003 season]] in third place.<ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\n===Relocation to Tallinn===\nIn 2004, Levadia moved to [[Tallinn]], while the club's previously Tallinn-based reserve team changed its name to [[FC Levadia II Tallinn|Levadia II]]. Under R\u00fc\u00fctli, Levadia won the league in the [[2004 Meistriliiga|2004 season]], but failed to defend the title in [[2005 Meistriliiga|2005]], finishing as runners-up. In the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup]] qualifying rounds, Levadia defeated [[FC Haka|Haka]] and [[FC Twente|Twente]], but lost to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] 1\u20133 on aggregate in the first round.<ref name=\"hist\"/> Levadia won two more Meistriliiga titles in [[2006 Meistriliiga|2006]] and [[2007 Meistriliiga|2007]]. In March 2008, R\u00fc\u00fctli was hired by the [[Estonian Football Association]] to coach the [[Estonia national football team|Estonia national team]] and his assistant [[Igor Prins]] took over as manager. Under Prins, Levadia won two consecutive Meistriliiga titles in [[2008 Meistriliiga|2008]] and [[2009 Meistriliiga|2009]] and an Estonian Cup in [[2009\u201310 Estonian Cup|2010]]. In August 2010, Prins was sacked due to disagreements with the board and replaced by Levadia II manager [[Aleksandr Pu\u0161tov]]. Levadia finished the [[2010 Meistriliiga|2010 season]] as runners-up. In July 2011, Pu\u0161tov was sacked after disappointing results in the Meistriliiga and the Champions League and replaced by [[Sergei Hohlov-Simson]]. Levadia finished the [[2011 Meistriliiga|2011 season]] in fourth place, their lowest ever league placing since the club was promoted to the Meistriliiga.\n\nIn December 2011, [[Marko Kristal]] was appointed as manager. The club won the [[2011\u201312 Estonian Cup]] and finished the [[2012 Meistriliiga|2012 season]] as runners-up. Levadia won the Meistriliiga title in the [[2013 Meistriliiga|2013 season]]. The team defended their title in [[2014 Meistriliiga|2014]], but finished the [[2015 Meistriliiga|2015 season]] as runners-up. In November 2015, it was announced that Sergei Ratnikov will return to Levadia after 15 years and replace Kristal as manager. Ratnikov's second tenure as Levadia's manager lasted until July 2016, when he was sacked following a 0\u20131 loss to [[P\u00e4rnu Linnameeskond]]. He was replaced by another returning manager, Igor Prins. Levadia finished the [[2016 Meistriliiga|2016 season]] as runners-up. Following another second-place finish in the [[2017 Meistriliiga|2017 season]], Levadia and [[FCI Tallinn]] merged their first teams, becoming FCI Levadia, with FCI Tallinn's [[Aleksandar Rogi\u0107]] taking over as manager. On 15 September 2019, Rogi\u0107 was sacked after disappointing results, with assistant coach Vladimir Vassiljev taking over as caretaker manager. In November 2019, former Estonia head coach and record cap holder [[Martin Reim]] was appointed as manager.\n\n==Stadiums==\n[[File:Alecoqarena.jpg|right|thumb|A.

In 2017, Levadia's first team merged with [[FCI Tallinn]], and became FCI Levadia.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nLevadia was founded on 22 October 1998, when Viktor Levada's Levadia Group O\u00dc became the official sponsor of [[Maardu]] based [[Esiliiga]] club [[FK Maardu|Ol\u00fcmp]], which subsequently changed its name to Levadia. The club won the [[1998 Esiliiga]] and were promoted to the [[Meistriliiga]]. In January 1999, [[Sergei Ratnikov]] was appointed as manager. In 1999, Levadia became the first team to win the Meistriliiga, the [[Estonian Cup]] and the [[Estonian Supercup]] in the same year. Levadia managed to repeat their success by winning another treble in the following year. In the [[2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League]], Levadia defeated [[The New Saints F.C.|Total Network Solutions]] 2\u20136 on aggregate in the first qualifying round, but lost to [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] 2\u20139 on aggregate in the second qualifying round. Following the loss to Shakhtar Donetsk, Ratnikov was sacked.<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web|title=Klubi ajalugu|trans-title=Club history|language=Estonian|publisher=FC Levadia|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427185029/http://www.fclevadia.ee:80/dyna/site/64est.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, [[Valeri Bondarenko]] was appointed as a manager. Levadia failed to defend their title, finishing the [[2001 Meistriliiga|2001 season]] in third place and in November 2001, Bondarenko was replaced by [[Pasi Rautiainen]]. Under Rautiainen, Levadia finished the [[2002 Meistriliiga]] as runners-up, only two points behind champions [[FC Flora|Flora]]. After the season, Rautiainen resigned and was replaced by [[Franco Pancheri]] in January 2003. Pancheri coached Levadia for just 9 Meistriliiga matches, before he was sacked in June 2003. He was replaced by [[Tarmo R\u00fc\u00fctli]] and Levadia finished the [[2003 Meistriliiga|2003 season]] in third place.<ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\n===Relocation to Tallinn===\nIn 2004, Levadia moved to [[Tallinn]], while the club's previously Tallinn-based reserve team changed its name to [[FC Levadia II Tallinn|Levadia II]]. Under R\u00fc\u00fctli, Levadia won the league in the [[2004 Meistriliiga|2004 season]], but failed to defend the title in [[2005 Meistriliiga|2005]], finishing as runners-up. In the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup]] qualifying rounds, Levadia defeated [[FC Haka|Haka]] and [[FC Twente|Twente]], but lost to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] 1\u20133 on aggregate in the first round.<ref name=\"hist\"/> Levadia won two more Meistriliiga titles in [[2006 Meistriliiga|2006]] and [[2007 Meistriliiga|2007]]. In March 2008, R\u00fc\u00fctli was hired by the [[Estonian Football Association]] to coach the [[Estonia national football team|Estonia national team]] and his assistant [[Igor Prins]] took over as manager. Under Prins, Levadia won two consecutive Meistriliiga titles in [[2008 Meistriliiga|2008]] and [[2009 Meistriliiga|2009]] and an Estonian Cup in [[2009\u201310 Estonian Cup|2010]]. In August 2010, Prins was sacked due to disagreements with the board and replaced by Levadia II manager [[Aleksandr Pu\u0161tov]]. Levadia finished the [[2010 Meistriliiga|2010 season]] as runners-up. In July 2011, Pu\u0161tov was sacked after disappointing results in the Meistriliiga and the Champions League and replaced by [[Sergei Hohlov-Simson]]. Levadia finished the [[2011 Meistriliiga|2011 season]] in fourth place, their lowest ever league placing since the club was promoted to the Meistriliiga.\n\nIn December 2011, [[Marko Kristal]] was appointed as manager. The club won the [[2011\u201312 Estonian Cup]] and finished the [[2012 Meistriliiga|2012 season]] as runners-up. Levadia won the Meistriliiga title in the [[2013 Meistriliiga|2013 season]]. The team defended their title in [[2014 Meistriliiga|2014]], but finished the [[2015 Meistriliiga|2015 season]] as runners-up. In November 2015, it was announced that Sergei Ratnikov will return to Levadia after 15 years and replace Kristal as manager. Ratnikov's second tenure as Levadia's manager lasted until July 2016, when he was sacked following a 0\u20131 loss to [[P\u00e4rnu Linnameeskond]]. He was replaced by another returning manager, Igor Prins. Levadia finished the [[2016 Meistriliiga|2016 season]] as runners-up. Following another second-place finish in the [[2017 Meistriliiga|2017 season]], Levadia and [[FCI Tallinn]] merged their first teams, becoming FCI Levadia, with FCI Tallinn's [[Aleksandar Rogi\u0107]] taking over as manager. On 15 September 2019, Rogi\u0107 was sacked after disappointing results, with assistant coach Vladimir Vassiljev taking over as caretaker manager. In November 2019, former Estonia head coach and record cap holder [[Martin Reim]] was appointed as manager.\n\n==Stadiums==\n[[File:Alecoqarena.jpg|right|thumb|A.

Prussia never had a major navy, nor did the other German states before the [[German Empire]] was formed in 1871. Tirpitz took the modest Imperial Navy and, starting in the 1890s, turned it into a world-class force that could threaten Britain's [[Royal Navy]]. However, during [[World War I]], his [[High Seas Fleet]] proved unable to end Britain's [[Command of the sea|command of the sea]] and its chokehold on Germany's economy. The one great engagement at sea, the [[Battle of Jutland]], ended in a narrow German tactical victory but a strategic failure. As the High Seas Fleet's limitations became increasingly apparent during the war, Tirpitz became an outspoken advocate for [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], a policy which would ultimately bring Germany into conflict with the United States. By the beginning of 1916, he was dismissed from office and never regained power.\n\n==Family and early life==\nTirpitz was born in [[K\u00fcstrin]] (today Kostrzyn in [[Poland]]) in the [[Prussia]]n province of [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], the son of lawyer and later judge Rudolf Tirpitz (1811\u20131905). His mother was the daughter of a doctor. Tirpitz grew up in [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. He recorded in his memoirs that as a child he was a mediocre pupil.\n\nTirpitz spoke [[English language|English]] fluently and was sufficiently at home in [[UK|Great Britain]] that he sent his two daughters to [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]].\n\nOn 18 November 1884 he married Maria Augusta Lipke (born 11 October 1860 in Schwetz, West Prussia, died after 1941). \nOn 12 June 1900 he was elevated to the Prussian nobility, becoming [[von]] Tirpitz. His son, ''Oberleutnant zur See'' Wolfgang von Tirpitz, was taken [[prisoner of war]] following the sinking of {{SMS|Mainz}} in the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] on 28 August 1914.\n\n==Naval career==\nTirpitz joined the [[Prussian Navy]] more by accident than design when a friend announced that he was doing so. Tirpitz decided he liked the idea and with the consent of his parents became a naval cadet at the age of 16, on 24 April 1865. He attended [[Kiel]] Naval School. Within a year Prussia was at war with Austria. Tirpitz became a midshipman ([[Seekadett]]) on 24 June 1866 and was posted to a sailing ship patrolling the [[English Channel]]. In 1866 Prussia became part of the [[North German Confederation]], the navy officially became that of the confederation and Tirpitz joined the new institution on 24 June 1869.\n\nOn 22 September 1869 he had obtained the rank of ''[[Unterleutnant zur See]]'' (sub-lieutenant) and served on board {{SMS|K\u00f6nig Wilhelm}}. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] the Prussian Navy was greatly outnumbered and so the ship spent the duration of the war at anchor, much to the embarrassment of the navy. During the early years of Tirpitz's career, Prussia and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] were on good terms and the Prussian Navy spent much time in British ports. Tirpitz reported that [[Plymouth]] was more hospitable to German sailors than was [[Kiel]], while it was also easier to obtain equipment and supplies there, which were of better quality than available at home. At this time the British [[Royal Navy]] was pleased to assist that of Prussia in its development and a considerable respect grew up in Prussian officers of their British counterparts.<ref>Massie p. 166</ref>\n\n===Development of torpedoes===\n[[Unification of Germany]] in 1871 again meant a change of name, to the [[German Imperial Navy]]. On 25 May 1872 Tirpitz was promoted to ''[[Leutnant zur See]]'' (lieutenant at sea) and on 18 November 1875 to ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' (captain-lieutenant). In 1877 he was chosen to visit the [[Whitehead Torpedo]] development works at [[Fiume]] and afterwards was placed in charge of the German torpedo section, later renamed the torpedo inspectorate. By 1879 a working device had been produced, but even under demonstration conditions Tirpitz reckoned it was as likely to miss a target as to hit it. On 17 September 1881 he became ''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (corvette captain). From developing torpedoes, Tirpitz moved on to developing torpedo boats to deliver them. The State Secretary for the Navy, [[Leo von Caprivi]], was a distant relation, and Tirpitz now worked with him on the development of tactics. Caprivi envisioned that the boats would be used defensively against their most likely enemy, France, but Tirpitz set about developing plans to attack the French home port of [[Cherbourg]]. Tirpitz later described his time with torpedo boats as 'the eleven best years of my life'.<ref>Massie p. 167</ref>\n\n===Strategic development of the Navy===\nIn 1887 the torpedo boats escorted [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Prince Wilhelm]] to attend the Golden Jubilee celebrations of his grandmother, [[Queen Victoria]]. This was the first time Tirpitz met Wilhelm. In July 1888 Caprivi was succeeded by [[Alexander von Monts]]. Torpedo boats were no longer considered important, and Tirpitz requested transfer, commanding the cruisers {{SMS|Preussen|1873|6}} and then {{SMS|W\u00fcrttemberg|1878|6}}. He was promoted to Captain ([[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]) 24 November 1888 and in 1890 became chief of staff of the Baltic Squadron. On one occasion the Kaiser was attending dinner with the senior naval officers at Kiel and asked their opinion on how the navy should develop. Finally the question came to Tirpitz and he advised building battleships. This was an answer which appealed to the Kaiser, and nine months later he was transferred to [[Berlin]] to work on a new strategy for creating a high seas fleet. Tirpitz appointed a staff of officers he had known from his time with the torpedo boats and collected together all sorts of vessels as stand-in battleships to conduct exercises to test out tactics. On 1 December 1892 he made a presentation of his findings to the Kaiser. This brought him into conflict with the Navy State Secretary, Admiral [[Friedrich von Hollmann]]. Hollmann was responsible for procurement of ships, and had a policy of collecting ships as funding permitted. Tirpitz had concluded that the best fighting arrangement was a squadron of eight identical battleships, rather than any other combination of ships with mixed abilities. Further ships should then be added in groups of eight. Hollmann favoured a mixed fleet including cruisers for long distance operations overseas. Tirpitz believed that in a war no number of cruisers would be safe unless backed up by sufficient battleships.\n\n''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' (captain at sea) Tirpitz became chief of the naval staff in 1892 and was made a ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (rear admiral) in 1895.\n\nIn autumn 1895, frustrated by the non-adoption of his recommendations, Tirpitz asked to be replaced. The Kaiser, not wishing to lose him, asked instead that he prepare a set of recommendations for ship construction. This was delivered on 3 January 1896, but the timing was bad as it coincided with raids into the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] in [[Southern Africa]] by pro-British forces against the pro-German [[Boers]]. The Kaiser immediately set his mind to demanding cruisers which could operate at a distance and influence the war. Hollman was tasked with obtaining money from the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' for a building programme, but failed to gain funding for enough ships to satisfy anyone. [[Reichskanzler|Imperial Chancellor]] [[Prince Chlodwig von Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst|Hohenlohe]] saw no sense in naval enlargement and reported back that the Reichstag opposed it. Admiral [[Gustav von Senden-Bibran]], Chief of the Naval Cabinet, advised that the only possibility lay in replacing Hollmann: Wilhelm impulsively decided to appoint Tirpitz.<ref>Massie, pp. 169\u2013170</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, however, Hollmann had obtained funding for one battleship and three large cruisers. It was felt that replacing him before the bill had completed approval through the Reichstag would be a mistake. Instead, Tirpitz was placed in charge of the [[German East Asia Squadron]] in the [[Far East]] but with a promise of appointment as Secretary at a suitable moment. The cruiser squadron operated from British facilities in [[Hong Kong]] which were far from satisfactory as the German ships always took second place for available docks. Tirpitz was instructed to find a suitable site for a new port, selecting four possible sites. Although he initially favoured the bay at [[Jiaozhou Bay concession|Kiautschou/Tsingtao]], others in the naval establishment advocated a different location and even Tirpitz wavered on his commitment in his final report. A 'lease' on the land was acquired in 1898 after it was fortuitously occupied by German forces. On 12 March 1896 the Reichstag cut back Hollmann's appropriation of 70 million marks to 58 million, and Hollman offered his resignation. Tirpitz was summoned home and offered the post of Secretary of the Imperial Navy office ([[Reichsmarineamt]]). He went home the long way, touring the United States on the way and arriving in Berlin 6 June 1897. He was pessimistic of his chances of succeeding with the Reichstag.<ref>Massie p. 171</ref>\n\n===State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office===\nOn 15 June Tirpitz presented a memorandum on the makeup and purpose of the German fleet to the Kaiser. This defined the principal enemy as Great Britain, and the principal area of conflict to be that between [[Heligoland]] and the [[River Thames|Thames]]. Cruiser warfare around the globe was deemed impractical because Germany had few bases to resupply ships, while the chief need was for as many battleships as possible to take on the British fleet. A target was outlined for two squadrons of eight battleships, plus a fleet flagship and two reserves. This was to be completed by 1905 and cost 408 million marks, or 58 million per year, the same as the existing budget. The proposal was innovative in several ways. It made a clear statement of naval needs, whereas before the navy had grown piecemeal. It set out the programme for seven years ahead, which neither the Reichstag nor the navy should change. It defined a change in German foreign policy so as to justify the existence of the fleet: Great Britain up to this point had been friendly, now it was officially an enemy. The Kaiser agreed the plan and Tirpitz retired to [[Sankt Blasien|St Blasien]] in the [[Black Forest]] with a team of naval specialists to draft a [[German Naval Laws|naval bill]] for presentation to the Reichstag. Information about the plan leaked out to [[Eduard von Knorr|Admiral Knorr]], head of the [[German Imperial Naval High Command|Naval High Command]]. Tirpitz agreed to a joint committee to discuss changes in the navy, but then arranged that it never receive any information. Similarly, he arranged a joint committee with the Treasury State Secretary to discuss finance, which never discussed anything. Meanwhile, he continued his best efforts to convince the Kaiser and Chancellor, so that in due course he could announce the issues had already been decided at a higher level and thereby avoid debate.<ref>Massie pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\nOnce the bill was nearly complete Tirpitz started a round of visits to obtain support. First he visited the former Chancellor and elder statesman, [[Otto von Bismarck|Prince Bismarck]]. Armed with the announcement that the Kaiser intended to name the next ship launched ''Furst Bismarck'', he persuaded the former chancellor, who had been dismissed from office for disagreement with Wilhelm II, to modestly support the proposals. Tirpitz now visited the [[King of Saxony]], the Prince Regent of Bavaria, the [[Grand Duke of Baden]] and Oldenburg and the councils of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] towns. On 19 October the draft bill was sent to the printers for presentation to the ''Reichstag''. Tirpitz's approach was to be as accommodating with the deputies as he could. He was patient and good humoured, proceeding on the assumption that if everything was explained carefully, then the deputies would naturally be convinced. Groups were invited to private meetings to discuss the bill. Tours of ships and shipyards were arranged. The Kaiser and Chancellor stressed that the fleet was only intended for protection of Germany, but so that even a first class power might think twice before attacking. Highlights from a letter Prince Bismarck wrote were read out in the Reichstag, though not mentioning passages where he expressed reservations. Papers were circulated showing the relative size of foreign fleets, and how much Germany had fallen behind, particularly when considering the great power of her army compared to others.<ref>Massie pp. 174\u2013178</ref>\n\nA press bureau was created in the Navy Ministry to ensure journalists were thoroughly briefed, and to politely answer any and all objections. Pre-written articles were provided for the convenience of journalists. University professors were invited to speak on the importance of protecting German trade. The [[Navy League (Germany)|Navy League]] was formed to popularise the idea of world naval power and its importance to the [[German Empire|Empire]]. It was argued that colonies overseas were essential, and Germany deserved her 'place in the sun'. League membership grew from 78,000 in 1898, to 600,000 in 1901 and 1.1 million by 1914. Especial attention was given to members of the budget committee who would consider the bill in detail. Their interests and connections were analysed to find ways to influence them. Steel magnate [[Friedrich Alfred Krupp|Fritz Krupp]] and shipowner [[Albert Ballin]] of the [[Hamburg-America Line]] were invited to speak on the benefits of the bill to trade and industry.<ref>Massie p. 178</ref>\n\nObjections were raised that the bill surrendered one of the most important powers of the Reichstag, that of annually scrutinising expenditure. Conservatives felt that expenditure on the navy was wasted, and that if money was available it should go to the army, which would be the deciding factor in any likely war. [[Eugen Richter]] of the Liberal Radical Union opposing the bill observed that if it was intended for Germany now seriously to take up the Trident to match its other forces then such a small force would not suffice and there would be no end to ship building. [[August Bebel]] of the Social Democrats argued that there existed a number of deputies who were Anglophobes and wished to pick a fight with Britain, but that to imagine such a fleet could take on the Royal Navy was insanity and anyone saying it belonged in the madhouse.<ref>Massie pp. 177\u2013179</ref>\n\nYet by the end of the debates the country was convinced that the bill would and should be passed. On 26 March 1898 it did so, by a majority of 212 to 139. All those around the Kaiser were ecstatic at their success. Tirpitz as navy minister was elevated to a seat on the Prussian Ministry of State. His influence and importance as the man who had accomplished this miracle was assured and he was to remain at the center of government for the next nineteen years.\n\n====Second Naval Bill====\nOne year after the passage of the bill Tirpitz appeared before the Reichstag and declared his satisfaction with it. The specified fleet would still be smaller than the French or British, but would be able to deter the Russians in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]]. Within another year all had changed. In October 1899 the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] broke out between the British and [[Boers]] in [[South Africa]]. In January 1900 a British cruiser intercepted three German mail steamers and searched them for war supplies intended for the Boers. Germany was outraged and the opportunity presented itself for a second Naval Bill. The second bill doubled the number of battleships from nineteen to thirty-eight. This would form four squadrons of eight ships, plus two flagships and four reserves. The bill now spanned seventeen years from 1901 to 1917 with the final ships being completed by 1920. This would constitute the second-largest fleet in the world and although no mention was made in the bill of specific enemies, it made several general mentions of a greater power which it was intended to oppose. There was only one navy which could be meant. On 5 December 1899 Tirpitz was promoted to ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (vice admiral). The bill passed on 20 June 1900.<ref>Massie pp. 180\u2013181</ref>\n\nSpecifically written into the preamble was an explanation of Tirpitz's Risk Theory. Although the German fleet would be smaller, it was likely that an enemy with a world spanning empire would not be able to concentrate all its forces in local waters. Even if it could, the German fleet would still be sufficiently powerful to inflict significant damage in any battle, sufficient damage that the enemy would be unable to maintain its other naval commitments and must suffer irreparable harm. Thus no such enemy would risk an engagement. Privately Tirpitz acknowledged that a second risk existed: that Britain, seeing its growing enemy might choose to strike first, might destroy the German fleet before it grew to a dangerous size. A similar course had been taken before, when [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] sank [[Denmark|Danish]] ships [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|at Copenhagen]] to prevent them falling into French hands, and would be again in the [[Second World War]] when French ships were sunk [[Attack on Mers-el-Kebir|at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]] to prevent them falling into German hands. A term, \"[[Copenhagenization (naval)|Copenhagenization]]\", even existed in English for this. Tirpitz calculated this danger period would end in 1904 or 1905. In the event, Britain responded to the increased German building programme by building more ships herself and the theoretical danger period extended itself to beyond the start of the Great War. As a reward for the successful bill Tirpitz was ennobled with the hereditary article ''von'' before his name in 1900.<ref>Massie pp. 181\u2013182</ref>\n\nTirpitz noted the difficulties in his relationship with the Kaiser. Wilhelm respected him as the only man who had succeeded in persuading the Reichstag to start and then increase a world class navy, but he remained unpredictable. He was fanatical about the navy, but would come up with wild ideas for improvements, which Tirpitz had to deflect to maintain his objectives. Each summer Tirpitz would go to St Blasien with his aides to work on naval plans, then in September he would travel to the Kaiser's retreat at [[Rominten Hunting Lodge|Rominten]], where Tirpitz found he would be more relaxed and willing to listen to a well argued explanation.<ref>Massie pp. 182\u2013183</ref>\n\nThree supplementary naval bills ('Novelles') were passed, in June 1906, April 1908 and June 1912. The first followed German diplomatic defeats over [[Morocco]], and added six large cruisers to the fleet. The second followed fears of British encroachment, and reduced the replacement time which a ship would remain in service from 25 to 20 years. The third was caused by the [[Agadir Crisis]] where again Germany had to draw back. This time three more battleships were added.<ref>Massie p. 183</ref>\n\nThe first naval law caused little alarm in Great Britain. There was already in force a dual power standard defining the size of the British fleet as at least that of the next two largest fleets combined. There was now a new player, but her fleet was similar in size to the other two possible threats, Russia and France, and a number of battleships were already under construction. The second naval law, however, caused serious alarm: eight [[King Edward VII-class battleship]]s were ordered in response. It was the regularity and efficiency with which Germany was now building ships, which were seen to be as good as any in the world, which raised concern. Information about the design of the new battleships suggested they were only intended to operate within a short range of a home base and not to stay at sea for extended periods. They seemed designed only for operations in the [[North Sea]]. The result was that Britain abandoned its policy of isolation which had held force since the time of Nelson and began to look for allies against the growing threat from Germany. Ships were withdrawn from around the world and brought back to British waters, while construction of new ships increased.<ref>Massie pp. 184\u2013185</ref>\n\n====Tirpitz Plan====\nTirpitz's design to achieve world power status through naval power, while at the same time addressing domestic issues, is referred to as the [[Tirpitz Plan]]. Politically, the Tirpitz Plan was marked by the [[Fleet Acts]] of 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1912. By 1914, they had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world (roughly 40% smaller than the [[Royal Navy]]). It included seventeen modern [[Battleship|dreadnoughts]], five [[battlecruiser]]s, twenty-five [[cruiser]]s and twenty pre-dreadnought [[battleship]]s as well as over forty [[submarine]]s. Although including fairly unrealistic targets, the expansion programme was sufficient to alarm the British, starting a costly naval arms race and pushing the British into closer ties with the French.\n\nTirpitz developed a \"Risk Theory\" whereby, if the [[German Imperial Navy]] reached a certain level of strength relative to the British [[Royal Navy]], the British would try to avoid confrontation with Germany (that is, maintain a [[fleet in being]]). If the two navies fought, the German Navy would inflict enough damage on the British that the latter ran a risk of losing their naval dominance. Because the British relied on their navy to maintain control over the [[British Empire]], Tirpitz felt they would opt to maintain naval supremacy in order to safeguard their empire, and let Germany become a world power, rather than lose the empire at the cost of keeping Germany less powerful. This theory sparked a naval [[arms race]] between Germany and Great Britain in the first decade of the 20th century.\n\n[[Image:Alfred v.Tirpitz 1915.png|thumb|upright|left|Grand Admiral von Tirpitz in 1915]]\n\nThis theory was based on the assumption that Great Britain would have to send its fleet into the [[North Sea]] to blockade the German ports (blockading Germany was the only way the Royal Navy could seriously harm Germany), where the German Navy could force a battle. However, due to Germany's geographic location, Great Britain could blockade Germany by closing the entrance to the North Sea in the [[English Channel]] and the area between [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] and the [[Shetland Islands]]. Faced with this option a German Admiral commented, \"If the British do that, the role of our navy will be a sad one,\" correctly predicting the role the surface fleet would have during the [[First World War]].\n\nPolitically and strategically, Tirpitz's Risk Theory ensured its own failure. By its very nature it forced Britain into measures that would have been previously unacceptable to the British establishment. The necessity to concentrate the fleet against the German threat involved Britain making arrangements with other powers that enabled her to return the bulk of her naval forces to [[Home Fleet|Home Waters]]. The first evidence of this is seen in the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|Anglo-Japanese treaty]] of 1902 that enabled the battleships of the China squadron to be re-allocated back to Europe. The Japanese fleet, largely constructed in British shipyards, then proceeded to utterly destroy the Russian navy in the [[Russo-Japanese War|war of 1904\u201305]], removing Russia as a credible maritime opponent. The necessity to reduce the Mediterranean Fleet in order to reinforce the navy in home waters was also a powerful influence in its d\u00e9tente and [[Entente Cordiale]] with the French. By forcing the British to come to terms with its most traditional opponent, Tirpitz scuttled his own policy. Britain was no longer at 'risk' from France, and the Japanese destruction of the Russian fleet removed that nation as a naval threat. In the space of a few years, Germany was faced with virtually the whole strength of the Royal Navy deployed against its own fleet, and Britain committed to her list of potential enemies. The Tirpitz 'risk theory' made it more probable that, in any future conflict between the European powers, Britain would be on the side of Germany's foes, and that the full force of the most powerful navy in the world would be concentrated against her fleet.\n\nTirpitz had been made a ''[[Gro\u00dfadmiral]]'' (grand admiral) in 1911, without patent (the document that accompanied formal promotions personally signed at this level by the Kaiser himself). At that time, the [[German Imperial Navy]] had only four ranks for admirals: rear admiral, (''Konteradmiral'', equal to a ''Generalmajor'' in the army, with no pips on the shoulders); vice admiral (''Vizeadmiral'', equal to a ''Generalleutnant'', with one pip); admiral (equal to a ''General der Infanterie'', with two pips), and grand admiral (equal to a field marshal). Tirpitz's shoulder boards had four pips, and he never received a grand admiral's baton or the associated insignia. \n\n====World War I====\n\nDespite the building programme he oversaw, he believed that the war had come too soon for a successful surface challenge to the Royal Navy, as the Fleet Act of 1900 had included a seventeen-year timetable. Unable to direct naval operations from his purely administrative position, Tirpitz became a vocal spokesman for unrestricted [[U-boat]] warfare, which he felt could break the British stranglehold on Germany's sea lines of communication. While the German Navy briefly abandoned the observance of prize rules in 1915, this policy was soon reversed following the outcry over [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|the Lusitania's sinking]]. When the restrictions on the submarine war were not lifted, he fell out with the Kaiser and felt compelled to resign on 15 March 1916. He was replaced as Secretary of State of the Imperial Naval Office by [[Eduard von Capelle]]. \n\nDespite his support for unrestricted U-boat warfare, Tirpitz placed a low priority on submarine construction during his leadership of the Imperial Naval Office. Ultimately, this decision would result in a severe shortage of newly built U-boats by 1917.\n\n==Fatherland Party==\nIn 1917, Grand Admiral Tirpitz was co-founder of the [[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanic]] and nationalist [[Fatherland Party (Germany)|Fatherland Party]] (''Deutsche Vaterlandspartei'').<ref>Patrick J. Kelly, ''Tirpitz and the Imperial German Navy'' (2011) pp. 410\u2013421</ref> The party was organised jointly by [[Heinrich Cla\u00df]], [[Konrad Freiherr von Wangenheim]], Tirpitz as chairman and [[Wolfgang Kapp]] as his deputy. The party attracted the opponents of a negotiated peace and organised opposition to the parliamentary majority which was seeking peace negotiations. It sought to bring together outside parliament all parties on the political right, which had not previously been done. At its peak, in the summer of 1918, it had around 1,250,000 members. It proposed both ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[General (Germany)|General]] [[Erich Ludendorff]] as 'people's emperors' of a [[military state]] whose legitimacy was based upon war and war aims instead of on the parliamentary government of the ''Reich''. Internally, there were calls for a ''[[coup d'etat]]'' against the German government, to be led by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, even against the Emperor if necessary. Tirpitz's experience with the Navy League and mass political agitation convinced him that the means for a coup was at hand.<ref>Raffael Scheck, ''Alfred von Tirpitz and German right-wing politics, 1914\u20131930'' (1998), chapter 5</ref>\n\nTirpitz considered that one of the main aims of the war must be annexation of new territory in the west, to allow Germany to develop into a world power. This meant holding the [[Belgium|Belgian]] ports of [[Zeebrugge]] and [[Ostend]], with an eye to the main enemy, the United Kingdom. He proposed a separate peace treaty with Russia, giving them access to the ocean. Germany would be a great [[Continental Europe|continental]] state but could maintain its world position only by expanding world trade and continuing the fight against the UK. He complained of indecision and ambiguity in German policy, humanitarian ideas of self-preservation, a policy of appeasement of neutrals at the expense of vital German interests, and begging for peace. He called for vigorous warfare without regard for diplomatic and commercial consequences and supported the most extreme use of weapons, especially unrestricted submarine warfare.\n\nFrom 1908 to 1918, Tirpitz was a member of the [[Prussian House of Lords]]. After Germany's defeat, he supported the right-wing [[German National People's Party]] (''Deutschnationale Volkspartei'', or ''DNVP'') and sat for it in the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' from 1924 until 1928.\n\nTirpitz died in Ebenhausen, near [[Munich]], on 6 March 1930. He is buried in the [[Munich Waldfriedhof|Waldfriedhof]] in Munich.\n\n==Honours==\n*Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of [[G\u00f6ttingen]] (16 June 1913) and [[Greifswald]]\n*Honorary doctorate of engineering from the [[Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg]]\n*Freeman of the city of [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] (15 January 1917)\n*The German battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] was named after him in 1939.\n\n;Foreign honours\n*{{flagicon|Russian Empire}} [[Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky]] \u2013 ''August 1902'' \u2013 during the visit of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] to the Russian fleet maneuvers in Reval.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence - the Imperial meeting at Reval |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36842| }}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n*{{cite book |title=My Memoirs |location= London/ New York |year=1919}} Republished in a single volume by NSNB with an introduction by Erik Empson in 2013 [https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Volumes-Illustrated-First-Classics-ebook/dp/B00DH2E9LE/ ASIN B00DH2E9LE].\n*{{cite book |title=The structure of German World Power |location= Stuttgart/ Berlin  |year=1924}}\n*{{cite book |title=German policy |location= Hamburg/Berlin |year=1926}}\n*{{cite book |title=Memories, 5 volumes | location= Berlin/Leipzig |year=1927}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anglo-German naval arms race]]\n* [[German interest in the Caribbean]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{commons}}\n===Works===\n* Tirpitz, Alfred von, ''Erinnerungen'' (Leipzig: K.F.Koehler, 1919).\n\n===Secondary source===\n* Berghahn, V.R.

Prussia never had a major navy, nor did the other German states before the [[German Empire]] was formed in 1871. Tirpitz took the modest Imperial Navy and, starting in the 1890s, turned it into a world-class force that could threaten Britain's [[Royal Navy]]. However, during [[World War I]], his [[High Seas Fleet]] proved unable to end Britain's [[Command of the sea|command of the sea]] and its chokehold on Germany's economy. The one great engagement at sea, the [[Battle of Jutland]], ended in a narrow German tactical victory but a strategic failure. As the High Seas Fleet's limitations became increasingly apparent during the war, Tirpitz became an outspoken advocate for [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], a policy which would ultimately bring Germany into conflict with the United States. By the beginning of 1916, he was dismissed from office and never regained power.\n\n==Family and early life==\nTirpitz was born in [[K\u00fcstrin]] (today Kostrzyn in [[Poland]]) in the [[Prussia]]n province of [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], the son of lawyer and later judge Rudolf Tirpitz (1811\u20131905). His mother was the daughter of a doctor. Tirpitz grew up in [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. He recorded in his memoirs that as a child he was a mediocre pupil.\n\nTirpitz spoke [[English language|English]] fluently and was sufficiently at home in [[UK|Great Britain]] that he sent his two daughters to [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]].\n\nOn 18 November 1884 he married Maria Augusta Lipke (born 11 October 1860 in Schwetz, West Prussia, died after 1941). \nOn 12 June 1900 he was elevated to the Prussian nobility, becoming [[von]] Tirpitz. His son, ''Oberleutnant zur See'' Wolfgang von Tirpitz, was taken [[prisoner of war]] following the sinking of {{SMS|Mainz}} in the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] on 28 August 1914.\n\n==Naval career==\nTirpitz joined the [[Prussian Navy]] more by accident than design when a friend announced that he was doing so. Tirpitz decided he liked the idea and with the consent of his parents became a naval cadet at the age of 16, on 24 April 1865. He attended [[Kiel]] Naval School. Within a year Prussia was at war with Austria. Tirpitz became a midshipman ([[Seekadett]]) on 24 June 1866 and was posted to a sailing ship patrolling the [[English Channel]]. In 1866 Prussia became part of the [[North German Confederation]], the navy officially became that of the confederation and Tirpitz joined the new institution on 24 June 1869.\n\nOn 22 September 1869 he had obtained the rank of ''[[Unterleutnant zur See]]'' (sub-lieutenant) and served on board {{SMS|K\u00f6nig Wilhelm}}. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] the Prussian Navy was greatly outnumbered and so the ship spent the duration of the war at anchor, much to the embarrassment of the navy. During the early years of Tirpitz's career, Prussia and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] were on good terms and the Prussian Navy spent much time in British ports. Tirpitz reported that [[Plymouth]] was more hospitable to German sailors than was [[Kiel]], while it was also easier to obtain equipment and supplies there, which were of better quality than available at home. At this time the British [[Royal Navy]] was pleased to assist that of Prussia in its development and a considerable respect grew up in Prussian officers of their British counterparts.<ref>Massie p. 166</ref>\n\n===Development of torpedoes===\n[[Unification of Germany]] in 1871 again meant a change of name, to the [[German Imperial Navy]]. On 25 May 1872 Tirpitz was promoted to ''[[Leutnant zur See]]'' (lieutenant at sea) and on 18 November 1875 to ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' (captain-lieutenant). In 1877 he was chosen to visit the [[Whitehead Torpedo]] development works at [[Fiume]] and afterwards was placed in charge of the German torpedo section, later renamed the torpedo inspectorate. By 1879 a working device had been produced, but even under demonstration conditions Tirpitz reckoned it was as likely to miss a target as to hit it. On 17 September 1881 he became ''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (corvette captain). From developing torpedoes, Tirpitz moved on to developing torpedo boats to deliver them. The State Secretary for the Navy, [[Leo von Caprivi]], was a distant relation, and Tirpitz now worked with him on the development of tactics. Caprivi envisioned that the boats would be used defensively against their most likely enemy, France, but Tirpitz set about developing plans to attack the French home port of [[Cherbourg]]. Tirpitz later described his time with torpedo boats as 'the eleven best years of my life'.<ref>Massie p. 167</ref>\n\n===Strategic development of the Navy===\nIn 1887 the torpedo boats escorted [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Prince Wilhelm]] to attend the Golden Jubilee celebrations of his grandmother, [[Queen Victoria]]. This was the first time Tirpitz met Wilhelm. In July 1888 Caprivi was succeeded by [[Alexander von Monts]]. Torpedo boats were no longer considered important, and Tirpitz requested transfer, commanding the cruisers {{SMS|Preussen|1873|6}} and then {{SMS|W\u00fcrttemberg|1878|6}}. He was promoted to Captain ([[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]) 24 November 1888 and in 1890 became chief of staff of the Baltic Squadron. On one occasion the Kaiser was attending dinner with the senior naval officers at Kiel and asked their opinion on how the navy should develop. Finally the question came to Tirpitz and he advised building battleships. This was an answer which appealed to the Kaiser, and nine months later he was transferred to [[Berlin]] to work on a new strategy for creating a high seas fleet. Tirpitz appointed a staff of officers he had known from his time with the torpedo boats and collected together all sorts of vessels as stand-in battleships to conduct exercises to test out tactics. On 1 December 1892 he made a presentation of his findings to the Kaiser. This brought him into conflict with the Navy State Secretary, Admiral [[Friedrich von Hollmann]]. Hollmann was responsible for procurement of ships, and had a policy of collecting ships as funding permitted. Tirpitz had concluded that the best fighting arrangement was a squadron of eight identical battleships, rather than any other combination of ships with mixed abilities. Further ships should then be added in groups of eight. Hollmann favoured a mixed fleet including cruisers for long distance operations overseas. Tirpitz believed that in a war no number of cruisers would be safe unless backed up by sufficient battleships.\n\n''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' (captain at sea) Tirpitz became chief of the naval staff in 1892 and was made a ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (rear admiral) in 1895.\n\nIn autumn 1895, frustrated by the non-adoption of his recommendations, Tirpitz asked to be replaced. The Kaiser, not wishing to lose him, asked instead that he prepare a set of recommendations for ship construction. This was delivered on 3 January 1896, but the timing was bad as it coincided with raids into the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] in [[Southern Africa]] by pro-British forces against the pro-German [[Boers]]. The Kaiser immediately set his mind to demanding cruisers which could operate at a distance and influence the war. Hollman was tasked with obtaining money from the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' for a building programme, but failed to gain funding for enough ships to satisfy anyone. [[Reichskanzler|Imperial Chancellor]] [[Prince Chlodwig von Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst|Hohenlohe]] saw no sense in naval enlargement and reported back that the Reichstag opposed it. Admiral [[Gustav von Senden-Bibran]], Chief of the Naval Cabinet, advised that the only possibility lay in replacing Hollmann: Wilhelm impulsively decided to appoint Tirpitz.<ref>Massie, pp. 169\u2013170</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, however, Hollmann had obtained funding for one battleship and three large cruisers. It was felt that replacing him before the bill had completed approval through the Reichstag would be a mistake. Instead, Tirpitz was placed in charge of the [[German East Asia Squadron]] in the [[Far East]] but with a promise of appointment as Secretary at a suitable moment. The cruiser squadron operated from British facilities in [[Hong Kong]] which were far from satisfactory as the German ships always took second place for available docks. Tirpitz was instructed to find a suitable site for a new port, selecting four possible sites. Although he initially favoured the bay at [[Jiaozhou Bay concession|Kiautschou/Tsingtao]], others in the naval establishment advocated a different location and even Tirpitz wavered on his commitment in his final report. A 'lease' on the land was acquired in 1898 after it was fortuitously occupied by German forces. On 12 March 1896 the Reichstag cut back Hollmann's appropriation of 70 million marks to 58 million, and Hollman offered his resignation. Tirpitz was summoned home and offered the post of Secretary of the Imperial Navy office ([[Reichsmarineamt]]). He went home the long way, touring the United States on the way and arriving in Berlin 6 June 1897. He was pessimistic of his chances of succeeding with the Reichstag.<ref>Massie p. 171</ref>\n\n===State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office===\nOn 15 June Tirpitz presented a memorandum on the makeup and purpose of the German fleet to the Kaiser. This defined the principal enemy as Great Britain, and the principal area of conflict to be that between [[Heligoland]] and the [[River Thames|Thames]]. Cruiser warfare around the globe was deemed impractical because Germany had few bases to resupply ships, while the chief need was for as many battleships as possible to take on the British fleet. A target was outlined for two squadrons of eight battleships, plus a fleet flagship and two reserves. This was to be completed by 1905 and cost 408 million marks, or 58 million per year, the same as the existing budget. The proposal was innovative in several ways. It made a clear statement of naval needs, whereas before the navy had grown piecemeal. It set out the programme for seven years ahead, which neither the Reichstag nor the navy should change. It defined a change in German foreign policy so as to justify the existence of the fleet: Great Britain up to this point had been friendly, now it was officially an enemy. The Kaiser agreed the plan and Tirpitz retired to [[Sankt Blasien|St Blasien]] in the [[Black Forest]] with a team of naval specialists to draft a [[German Naval Laws|naval bill]] for presentation to the Reichstag. Information about the plan leaked out to [[Eduard von Knorr|Admiral Knorr]], head of the [[German Imperial Naval High Command|Naval High Command]]. Tirpitz agreed to a joint committee to discuss changes in the navy, but then arranged that it never receive any information. Similarly, he arranged a joint committee  with the Treasury State Secretary to discuss finance, which never discussed anything. Meanwhile, he continued his best efforts to convince the Kaiser and Chancellor, so that in due course he could announce the issues had already been decided at a higher level and thereby avoid debate.<ref>Massie pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\nOnce the bill was nearly complete Tirpitz started a round of visits to obtain support. First he visited the former Chancellor and elder statesman, [[Otto von Bismarck|Prince Bismarck]]. Armed with the announcement that the Kaiser intended to name the next ship launched ''Furst Bismarck'', he persuaded the former chancellor, who had been dismissed from office for disagreement with Wilhelm II, to modestly support the proposals. Tirpitz now visited  the [[King of Saxony]], the Prince Regent of Bavaria, the [[Grand Duke of Baden]] and Oldenburg and the councils of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] towns. On 19 October the draft bill was sent to the printers for presentation to the ''Reichstag''. Tirpitz's approach was to be as accommodating with the deputies as he could. He was patient and good humoured, proceeding on the assumption that if everything was explained carefully, then the deputies would naturally be convinced. Groups were invited to private meetings to discuss the bill. Tours of ships and shipyards were arranged. The Kaiser and Chancellor stressed that the fleet was only intended for protection of Germany, but so that even a first class power might think twice before attacking. Highlights from a letter Prince Bismarck wrote were read out in the Reichstag, though not mentioning passages where he expressed reservations. Papers were circulated showing the relative size of foreign fleets, and how much Germany had fallen behind, particularly when considering the great power of her army compared to others.<ref>Massie pp. 174\u2013178</ref>\n\nA press bureau was created in the Navy Ministry to ensure journalists were thoroughly briefed, and to politely answer any and all objections. Pre-written articles were provided for the convenience of journalists. University professors were invited to speak on the importance of protecting German trade. The [[Navy League (Germany)|Navy League]] was formed to  popularise the idea of world naval power and its importance to the [[German Empire|Empire]]. It was argued that colonies overseas were essential, and Germany deserved her 'place in the sun'. League membership grew from 78,000 in 1898, to 600,000 in 1901 and 1.1 million by 1914. Especial attention was given to members of the budget committee who would consider the bill in detail. Their interests and connections were analysed to find ways to influence them. Steel magnate [[Friedrich Alfred Krupp|Fritz Krupp]] and shipowner [[Albert Ballin]] of the [[Hamburg-America Line]] were invited to speak on the benefits of the bill to trade and industry.<ref>Massie p. 178</ref>\n\nObjections were raised that the bill surrendered one of the most important powers of the Reichstag, that of annually scrutinising expenditure. Conservatives felt that expenditure on the navy was wasted, and that if money was available it should go to the army, which would be the deciding factor in any likely war. [[Eugen Richter]] of the Liberal Radical Union opposing the bill observed that if it was intended for Germany now seriously to take up the Trident to match its other forces then such a small force would not suffice and there would be no end to ship building. [[August Bebel]] of the Social Democrats argued that there existed a number of deputies who were Anglophobes and wished to pick a fight with Britain, but that to imagine such a fleet could take on the Royal Navy was insanity and anyone saying it belonged in the madhouse.<ref>Massie pp. 177\u2013179</ref>\n\nYet by the end of the debates the country was convinced that the bill would and should be passed. On 26 March 1898 it did so, by a majority of 212 to 139. All those around the Kaiser were ecstatic at their success. Tirpitz as navy minister was elevated to a seat on the Prussian Ministry of State. His influence and importance as the man who had accomplished this miracle was assured and he was to remain at the center of government for the next nineteen years.\n\n====Second Naval Bill====\nOne year after the passage of the bill Tirpitz appeared before the Reichstag and declared his satisfaction with it. The specified fleet would still be smaller than the French or British, but would be able to deter the Russians in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]]. Within another year all had changed. In October 1899 the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] broke out between the British and [[Boers]] in [[South Africa]]. In January 1900 a British cruiser intercepted three German mail steamers and searched them for war supplies intended for the Boers. Germany was outraged and the opportunity presented itself for a second Naval Bill. The second bill doubled the number of battleships from nineteen to thirty-eight. This would form four squadrons of eight ships, plus two flagships and four reserves. The bill now spanned seventeen years from 1901 to 1917 with the final ships being completed by 1920. This would constitute the second-largest fleet in the world and although no mention was made in the bill of specific enemies, it made several general mentions of a greater power which it was intended to oppose. There was only one navy which could be meant. On 5 December 1899 Tirpitz was promoted to ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (vice admiral). The bill passed on 20 June 1900.<ref>Massie pp. 180\u2013181</ref>\n\nSpecifically written into the preamble was an explanation of Tirpitz's Risk Theory. Although the German fleet would be smaller, it was likely that an enemy with a world spanning empire would not be able to concentrate all its forces in local waters. Even if it could, the German fleet would still be sufficiently powerful to inflict significant damage in any battle, sufficient damage that the enemy would be unable to maintain its other naval commitments and must suffer irreparable harm. Thus no such enemy would risk an engagement. Privately Tirpitz acknowledged that a second risk existed: that Britain, seeing its growing enemy might choose to strike first, might destroy the German fleet before it grew to a dangerous size. A similar course had been taken before, when [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] sank [[Denmark|Danish]] ships [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|at Copenhagen]] to prevent them falling into French hands, and would be again in the [[Second World War]] when French ships were sunk [[Attack on Mers-el-Kebir|at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]] to prevent them falling into German hands. A term, \"[[Copenhagenization (naval)|Copenhagenization]]\", even existed in English for this. Tirpitz calculated this danger period would end in 1904 or 1905. In the event, Britain responded to the increased German building programme by building more ships herself and the theoretical danger period extended itself to beyond the start of the Great War. As a reward for the successful bill Tirpitz was ennobled with the hereditary article ''von'' before his name in 1900.<ref>Massie pp. 181\u2013182</ref>\n\nTirpitz noted the difficulties in his relationship with the Kaiser. Wilhelm respected him as the only man who had succeeded in persuading the Reichstag to start and then increase a world class navy, but he remained unpredictable. He was fanatical about the navy, but would come up with wild ideas for improvements, which Tirpitz had to deflect to maintain his objectives. Each summer Tirpitz would go to St Blasien with his aides to work on naval plans, then in September he would travel to the Kaiser's retreat at [[Rominten Hunting Lodge|Rominten]], where Tirpitz found he would be more relaxed and willing to listen to a well argued explanation.<ref>Massie pp. 182\u2013183</ref>\n\nThree supplementary naval bills ('Novelles') were passed, in June 1906, April 1908 and June 1912. The first followed German diplomatic defeats over [[Morocco]], and added six large cruisers to the fleet. The second followed fears of British encroachment, and reduced the replacement time which a ship would remain in service from 25 to 20 years. The third was caused by the [[Agadir Crisis]] where again Germany had to draw back. This time three more battleships were added.<ref>Massie p. 183</ref>\n\nThe first naval law caused little alarm in Great Britain. There was already in force a dual power standard defining the size of the British fleet as at least that of the next two largest fleets combined. There was now a new player, but her fleet was similar in size to the other two possible threats, Russia and France, and a number of battleships were already under construction. The second naval law, however, caused serious alarm: eight [[King Edward VII-class battleship]]s were ordered in response. It was the regularity and efficiency with which Germany was now building ships, which were seen to be as good as any in the world, which raised concern. Information about the design of the new battleships suggested they were only intended to operate within a short range of a home base and not to stay at sea for extended periods. They seemed designed only for operations in the [[North Sea]]. The result was that Britain abandoned its policy of isolation which had held force since the time of Nelson and began to look for allies against the growing threat from Germany. Ships were withdrawn from around the world and brought back to British waters, while construction of new ships increased.<ref>Massie pp. 184\u2013185</ref>\n\n====Tirpitz Plan====\nTirpitz's design to achieve world power status through naval power, while at the same time addressing domestic issues, is referred to as the [[Tirpitz Plan]]. Politically, the Tirpitz Plan was marked by the [[Fleet Acts]] of 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1912. By 1914, they had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world (roughly 40% smaller than the [[Royal Navy]]). It included seventeen modern [[Battleship|dreadnoughts]], five [[battlecruiser]]s, twenty-five [[cruiser]]s and twenty pre-dreadnought [[battleship]]s as well as over forty [[submarine]]s. Although including fairly unrealistic targets, the expansion programme was sufficient to alarm the British, starting a costly naval arms race and pushing the British into closer ties with the French.\n\nTirpitz developed a \"Risk Theory\" whereby, if the [[German Imperial Navy]] reached a certain level of strength relative to the British [[Royal Navy]], the British would try to avoid confrontation with Germany (that is, maintain a [[fleet in being]]). If the two navies fought, the German Navy would inflict enough damage on the British that the latter ran a risk of losing their naval dominance. Because the British relied on their navy to maintain control over the [[British Empire]], Tirpitz felt they would opt to maintain naval supremacy in order to safeguard their empire, and let Germany become a world power, rather than lose the empire at the cost of keeping Germany less powerful. This theory sparked a naval [[arms race]] between Germany and Great Britain in the first decade of the 20th century.\n\n[[Image:Alfred v.Tirpitz 1915.png|thumb|upright|left|Grand Admiral von Tirpitz in 1915]]\n\nThis theory was based on the assumption that Great Britain would have to send its fleet into the [[North Sea]] to blockade the German ports (blockading Germany was the only way the Royal Navy could seriously harm Germany), where the German Navy could force a battle. However, due to Germany's geographic location, Great Britain could blockade Germany by closing the entrance to the North Sea in the [[English Channel]] and the area between [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] and the [[Shetland Islands]]. Faced with this option a German Admiral commented, \"If the British do that, the role of our navy will be a sad one,\" correctly predicting the role the surface fleet would have during the [[First World War]].\n\nPolitically and strategically, Tirpitz's Risk Theory ensured its own failure. By its very nature it forced Britain into measures that would have been previously unacceptable to the British establishment. The necessity to concentrate the fleet against the German threat involved Britain making arrangements with other powers that enabled her to return the bulk of her naval forces to [[Home Fleet|Home Waters]]. The first evidence of this is seen in the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|Anglo-Japanese treaty]] of 1902 that enabled the battleships of the China squadron to be re-allocated back to Europe. The Japanese fleet, largely constructed in British shipyards, then proceeded to utterly destroy the Russian navy in the [[Russo-Japanese War|war of 1904\u201305]], removing Russia as a credible maritime opponent. The necessity to reduce the Mediterranean Fleet in order to reinforce the navy in home waters was also a powerful influence in its d\u00e9tente and [[Entente Cordiale]] with the French. By forcing the British to come to terms with its most traditional opponent, Tirpitz scuttled his own policy. Britain was no longer at 'risk' from France, and the Japanese destruction of the Russian fleet removed that nation as a naval threat. In the space of a few years, Germany was faced with virtually the whole strength of the Royal Navy deployed against its own fleet, and Britain committed to her list of potential enemies. The Tirpitz 'risk theory' made it more probable that, in any future conflict between the European powers, Britain would be on the side of Germany's foes, and that the full force of the most powerful navy in the world would be concentrated against her fleet.\n\nTirpitz had been made a ''[[Gro\u00dfadmiral]]'' (grand admiral) in 1911, without patent (the document that accompanied formal promotions personally signed at this level by the Kaiser himself). At that time, the [[German Imperial Navy]] had only four ranks for admirals: rear admiral, (''Konteradmiral'', equal to a ''Generalmajor'' in the army, with no pips on the shoulders); vice admiral (''Vizeadmiral'', equal to a ''Generalleutnant'', with one pip); admiral (equal to a ''General der Infanterie'', with two pips), and grand admiral (equal to a field marshal). Tirpitz's shoulder boards had four pips, and he never received a grand admiral's baton or the associated insignia. \n\n====World War I====\n\nDespite the building programme he oversaw, he believed that the war had come too soon for a successful surface challenge to the Royal Navy, as the Fleet Act of 1900 had included a seventeen-year timetable. Unable to direct naval operations from his purely administrative position, Tirpitz became a vocal spokesman for unrestricted [[U-boat]] warfare, which he felt could break the British stranglehold on Germany's sea lines of communication. While the German Navy briefly abandoned the observance of prize rules in 1915, this policy was soon reversed following the outcry over [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|the Lusitania's sinking]]. When the restrictions on the submarine war were not lifted, he fell out with the Kaiser and felt compelled to resign on 15 March 1916. He was replaced as Secretary of State of the Imperial Naval Office by [[Eduard von Capelle]]. \n\nDespite his support for unrestricted U-boat warfare, Tirpitz placed a low priority on submarine construction during his leadership of the Imperial Naval Office. Ultimately, this decision would result in a severe shortage of newly built U-boats by 1917.\n\n==Fatherland Party==\nIn 1917, Grand Admiral Tirpitz was co-founder of the [[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanic]] and nationalist [[Fatherland Party (Germany)|Fatherland Party]] (''Deutsche Vaterlandspartei'').<ref>Patrick J. Kelly, ''Tirpitz and the Imperial German Navy'' (2011) pp. 410\u2013421</ref> The party was organised jointly by [[Heinrich Cla\u00df]], [[Konrad Freiherr von Wangenheim]], Tirpitz as chairman and [[Wolfgang Kapp]] as his deputy. The party attracted the opponents of a negotiated peace and organised opposition to the parliamentary majority which was seeking peace negotiations. It sought to bring together outside parliament all parties on the political right, which had not previously been done. At its peak, in the summer of 1918, it had around 1,250,000 members. It proposed both ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[General (Germany)|General]] [[Erich Ludendorff]] as 'people's emperors' of a [[military state]] whose legitimacy was based upon war and war aims instead of on the parliamentary government of the ''Reich''. Internally, there were calls for a ''[[coup d'etat]]'' against the German government, to be led by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, even against the Emperor if necessary. Tirpitz's experience with the Navy League and mass political agitation convinced him that the means for a coup was at hand.<ref>Raffael Scheck, ''Alfred von Tirpitz and German right-wing politics, 1914\u20131930'' (1998), chapter 5</ref>\n\nTirpitz considered that one of the main aims of the war must be annexation of new territory in the west, to allow Germany to develop into a world power. This meant holding the [[Belgium|Belgian]] ports of [[Zeebrugge]] and [[Ostend]], with an eye to the main enemy, the United Kingdom. He proposed a separate peace treaty with Russia, giving them access to the ocean. Germany would be a great [[Continental Europe|continental]] state but could maintain its world position only by expanding world trade and continuing the fight against the UK. He complained of indecision and ambiguity in German policy, humanitarian ideas of self-preservation, a policy of appeasement of neutrals at the expense of vital German interests, and begging for peace. He called for vigorous warfare without regard for diplomatic and commercial consequences and supported the most extreme use of weapons, especially unrestricted submarine warfare.\n\nFrom 1908 to 1918, Tirpitz was a member of the [[Prussian House of Lords]]. After Germany's defeat, he supported the right-wing [[German National People's Party]] (''Deutschnationale Volkspartei'', or ''DNVP'') and sat for it in the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' from 1924 until 1928.\n\nTirpitz died in Ebenhausen, near [[Munich]], on 6 March 1930. He is buried in the [[Munich Waldfriedhof|Waldfriedhof]] in Munich.\n\n==Honours==\n*Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of [[G\u00f6ttingen]] (16 June 1913) and [[Greifswald]]\n*Honorary doctorate of engineering from the [[Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg]]\n*Freeman of the city of [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] (15 January 1917)\n*The German battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] was named after him in 1939.\n\n;Foreign honours\n*{{flagicon|Russian Empire}} [[Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky]] \u2013 ''August 1902'' \u2013 during the visit of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] to the Russian fleet maneuvers in Reval.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence - the Imperial meeting at Reval |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36842| }}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n*{{cite book |title=My Memoirs |location= London/ New York |year=1919}} Republished in a single volume by NSNB with an introduction by Erik Empson in 2013 [https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Volumes-Illustrated-First-Classics-ebook/dp/B00DH2E9LE/ ASIN B00DH2E9LE].\n*{{cite book |title=The structure of German World Power |location= Stuttgart/ Berlin  |year=1924}}\n*{{cite book |title=German policy |location= Hamburg/Berlin |year=1926}}\n*{{cite book |title=Memories, 5 volumes | location= Berlin/Leipzig |year=1927}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anglo-German naval arms race]]\n* [[German interest in the Caribbean]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{commons}}\n===Works===\n* Tirpitz, Alfred von, ''Erinnerungen'' (Leipzig: K.F.Koehler, 1919).\n\n===Secondary source===\n* Berghahn, V.R.

It also features \"[[Astronomy Domine]]\", a [[Syd Barrett]] song not performed since the early 1970s. The track \"[[Another Brick in the Wall|Another Brick in the Wall, Part II]]\" features small portions of the songs \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part I\", \"[[The Happiest Days of Our Lives]]\" and \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part III\". \"[[Take It Back]]\" was originally going to be on the album with the recording from 25 September 1994, [[Stade Olympique de la Pontaise]], [[Lausanne]] but was cut due to length.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nUnlike the previous live album ''[[Delicate Sound of Thunder]]'', no parts of the songs were re-recorded in the studio.<ref>James Guthrie confirmed this in an interview with Pink Floyd fanzine ''Brain Damage''.</ref> However, the band and Guthrie fixed songs that had bad notes (as heard on some bootlegs) by lifting solos and corrected vocal lines from other performances as the band recorded most of the European leg. The album was mixed in [[QSound]], which produces a 3D audio effect even on a two channel stereo system.\n\n==Release history==\nIn the United States, despite a price of $34.99 (which included flashing spine light and two AA batteries) ''Pulse'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] during the week of 24 June 1995 with 198,000 copies sold, it became the first multidisk album to top the ''Billboard'' 200 since the chart started using [[SoundScan]] data in May 1991.<ref name=\"BBdebut\">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com.bo/books?id=zwsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA92|title=Between The Bullets|last=Mayfield|first=Geoff|date=June 24, 1995|page=92|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|issn=0006-2510|volume=107|number=25}}</ref> The next week it fell off to number three on the chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/1995-07-01|title=Top 200 Albums|date=July 1, 1995|publisher=[[Billboard 200]].

The [[Pulse (1995 film)|''Pulse'' DVD]] was released on 10 July 2006.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe vinyl version was released as a four-LP [[box set]] and included \"One of These Days\" (also heard on the cassette release) as well as a large version of the photo booklet.\n\nThe original CD cover features an \"eye-like\" machine that has clock pieces inside, there is a planet in its centre, and on the outside it shows evolution as it moves backwards. It starts in the sea, moves to the bacteria which evolve into fishes, then into egg type creatures, then into eggs that hatch birds, and birds follow the trail of an aeroplane. There are six pyramids in the desert, and in the bottom of the sea, one can observe a city in the shore.\n\nThe debut of the album was highlighted by a light show from the top of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City with music [[simulcast]]ed on a New York City radio station.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==LED packaging==\nEarly CD versions came with a flashing red [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] on the side of the case. This was designed by EMI contractor Jon Kempner, who was awarded the platinum disc, using the now discontinued LM3909 LED flasher IC. The circuit was powered by a single [[AA battery]]; the battery life was stated to be over six months. Some versions were also made with two AA batteries and later editions of the CD set did not feature the blinking LED.\n\n{{Quote|\"Essentially, it's a device which we thought was entertaining. It's an idea of [[Storm Thorgerson]]'s which related to ''Dark Side'' and the pulse, and it's a live album so the box is \"alive\". After that, in terms of seriously deep meanings, one might be struggling a bit.\"| [[Nick Mason]]|<ref>{{cite web | title=The 30 Year Technicolor Dream | author=Phil Sutcliffe | work=Mojo Magazine |

The track \"[[Another Brick in the Wall|Another Brick in the Wall, Part II]]\" features small portions of the songs \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part I\", \"[[The Happiest Days of Our Lives]]\" and \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part III\". \"[[Take It Back]]\" was originally going to be on the album with the recording from 25 September 1994, [[Stade Olympique de la Pontaise]], [[Lausanne]] but was cut due to length.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nUnlike the previous live album ''[[Delicate Sound of Thunder]]'', no parts of the songs were re-recorded in the studio.<ref>James Guthrie confirmed this in an interview with Pink Floyd fanzine ''Brain Damage''.</ref> However, the band and Guthrie fixed songs that had bad notes (as heard on some bootlegs) by lifting solos and corrected vocal lines from other performances as the band recorded most of the European leg. The album was mixed in [[QSound]], which produces a 3D audio effect even on a two channel stereo system.\n\n==Release history==\nIn the United States, despite a price of $34.99 (which included flashing spine light and two AA batteries) ''Pulse'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] during the week of June 24, 1995 with 198,000 copies sold, it became the first multidisk album to top the ''Billboard'' 200 since the chart started using [[SoundScan]] data in May 1991.<ref name=\"BBdebut\">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com.bo/books?id=zwsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA92|title=Between The Bullets|last=Mayfield|first=Geoff|date=June 24, 1995|page=92|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|issn=0006-2510|volume=107|number=25}}</ref> The next week it fell off to number three on the chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/1995-07-01|title=Top 200 Albums|date=July 1, 1995|publisher=[[Billboard 200]].

The [[Pulse (1995 film)|''Pulse'' DVD]] was released on 10 July 2006.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe vinyl version was released as a four-LP [[box set]] and included \"One of These Days\" (also heard on the cassette release) as well as a large version of the photo booklet.\n\nThe original CD cover features an \"eye-like\" machine that has clock pieces inside, there is a planet in its centre, and on the outside it shows evolution as it moves backwards. It starts in the sea, moves to the bacteria which evolve into fishes, then into egg type creatures, then into eggs that hatch birds, and birds follow the trail of an aeroplane. There are six pyramids in the desert, and in the bottom of the sea, one can observe a city in the shore.\n\nThe debut of the album was highlighted by a light show from the top of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City with music [[simulcast]]ed on a New York City radio station.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==LED packaging==\nEarly CD versions came with a flashing red [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] on the side of the case. This was designed by EMI contractor Jon Kempner, who was awarded the platinum disc, using the now discontinued LM3909 LED flasher IC. The circuit was powered by a single [[AA battery]]; the battery life was stated to be over six months. Some versions were also made with two AA batteries and later editions of the CD set did not feature the blinking LED.\n\n{{Quote|\"Essentially, it's a device which we thought was entertaining. It's an idea of [[Storm Thorgerson]]'s which related to ''Dark Side'' and the pulse, and it's a live album so the box is \"alive\". After that, in terms of seriously deep meanings, one might be struggling a bit.\"| [[Nick Mason]]|<ref>{{cite web | title=The 30 Year Technicolor Dream | author=Phil Sutcliffe | work=Mojo Magazine |

Maximian built several gigantic monuments, the large [[Circus (building)|circus]] (470 \u00d7 85 metres), the ''[[thermae]]'' or \"Baths of Hercules\", a large complex of imperial palaces and other services and buildings of which fewer visible traces remain. Maximian increased the city area surrounded by a new, larger stone wall (about 4.5&nbsp;km long) encompassing an area of 375 acres with many 24-sided towers. The monumental area had twin towers; one included in the convent of [[San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore | San Maurizio Maggiore]] remains 16.6 m high.\n\nFrom Mediolanum the [[Emperor Constantine]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 AD, granting tolerance to all religions within the Empire, and thus paving the way for [[Christianity]] to become the dominant religion of Roman Europe. Constantine had come to Mediolanum to celebrate the wedding of his sister to the Eastern Emperor, [[Licinius]].

In 539, the [[Ostrogoths]] conquered and destroyed Milan during the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In the summer of 569 the [[Lombards]] (from which the name of the Italian region [[Lombardy]] derives), conquered Milan, overpowering the small [[Byzantine army|Byzantine garrison]] left for its defence. Some Roman structures remained in use in Milan under Lombard rule.<ref>See the ''[[Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis]]''.</ref> Milan surrendered to [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Franks]] in 774.\n\nThe 11th century saw a reaction against the control of the German emperors. The city-state was born, an expression of the new political power of the city and its will to fight against all feudal powers. Milan was no exception. It did not take long, however, for the City States to begin fighting each other to try to limit neighbouring powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/tur/en/arteecultura/storia|title=Milan: a history of greatness, from its origins to the twentieth century|website=Portale per il Turismo del Comune di Milano|language=en|access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref> The Milanese destroyed Lodi and continuously warred with Pavia, Cremona and Como, who in turn asked the Emperor of Germany, Frederick I Barbarossa for help. This brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162. A fire destroyed the storehouses containing the entire food supply, and within just a few days Milan was forced to surrender.\n\nA period of peace followed and Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its position. As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1447 [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]] was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city.<ref name=\"lucas:268\">Henry S. Lucas, ''The Renaissance and the Reformation'' p. 268.</ref> Both the Guelph and the Ghibelline factions worked together to bring about the Ambrosian Republic in Milan. Nonetheless, the Republic collapsed when, in 1450, Milan was conquered by [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco I]] of the [[House of Sforza]], which made Milan one of the leading cities of the Italian [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"lucas:268\"/><ref name=\"InternationalStudent\">{{cite web|url=http://internationalrelations.unicatt.it/it/international_student/the_history_of_milan |title=The History of Milan \u2013 Relazioni Internazionali \u2013 Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore |publisher=internationalrelations.unicatt.it |accessdate=14 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108120442/http://internationalrelations.unicatt.it/it/international_student/the_history_of_milan |archivedate= 8 November 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Early modern===\n\nMilan's last independent ruler, [[Lodovico il Moro]], requested the aid of [[Charles VIII of France]] against the other Italian statelets, eventually unleashing the [[Italian Wars]]. The king's cousin, [[Louis XII|Louis of Orl\u00e9ans]], took part in the expedition and realized Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to [[Italian Wars|come back a few years later]] in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] family. At that time, Milan was also defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor Fran\u00e7ois I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignan]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[Fran\u00e7ois I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]]. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated Fran\u00e7ois I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, [[northern Italy]], including Milan, passed to [[Hapsburg Spain|Habsburg Spain]].<ref>John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.</ref>\n\nIn 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629\u20131631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629\u201331, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his masterpiece \"[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]\". This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague that began with the [[Black Death]].<ref>Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.</ref>\n\nIn 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]] to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Siege of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713\u20131714 the Treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan.\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\n[[File:Cinque giornate di Milano.jpg|thumb|Popular print depicting the \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" uprising against Austrian rule.]]\n\nOn March 18th, 1848 Milan efficaciously rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" ({{lang-it|Le Cinque Giornate}}), that forced Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering kingdom of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] sent troops in order to protect the insurgents and organsied a [[plebiscite]] that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont-Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy.  About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as Cavour, Garibaldi and Mazzini were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] in order to defeat Austria and estabilish a large Italian state in the region. At the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the [[Quadrilatero|Quadrilateral line]].<ref name=\"Solferino\">{{cite web|title=Solferino |author=Graham J.

A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard]] (1882) and [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon]] (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the [[Orient Express]] that started operating from 1919. Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading financial centre. Very rapid industrialization in the last two decades of the 1800s led to the birth of a massive worker class as well as bitter social conflicts. In May 1898 Milan was shaken by the [[Bava Beccaris massacre]], a riot related to soaring cost of living. \n\n[[File:Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (bombardata) 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] destroyed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings, 1943.]]\n[[File:MI-Milano-1961-piazza-Duca-d-Aosta.jpg|thumb|[[Pirelli Tower]], here in a 1961 picture, became the symbol of the modernity and audacity of the [[Italian economic miracle]].]]\n\nMilan's economic dominance in Italy secured also a leading role for the city on the political scene. It was in Milan that [[Benito Mussolini]] built his political and journalistic career's, and his fascist [[Blackshirts]] rallied for the first time in the city's [[Piazza San Sepolcro]]; here the future [[Fascist]] dictator launched his [[March on Rome]] on 28 October 1922.

The great [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], realised by [[Giuseppe Mengoni]] between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele II]], is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the [[Burlington Arcade]] in London.

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare Beccaria|Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caff\u00e8'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration.\n\nIn the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Here, too, [[Giuseppe Parini]], and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'' was inspired by a Napoleonic law that\u2014against the will of many of its inhabitants\u2014was being extended to the city.\n\nIn the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period [[Carlo Porta]], reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in [[Lombard Language]]. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.\n\nAfter the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to an Italian movement, ''[[Verismo]]''. The greatest ''verista'' novelist, [[Giovanni Verga]], was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.\n\nIn addition to Italian, approximately 2 million people in the Milan metropolitan area can speak the [[Milanese dialect]] or one of its [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard]] variations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coluzzi|first1=Paolo|title=Minority language planning and micronationalism in Italy : an analysis of the situation of Friulian, Cimbrian and Western Lombard with reference to Spanish minority languages|date=2007|publisher=New York|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3039110414|page=260}}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nMilan is an important national and international media centre. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', founded in 1876, is one of the oldest Italian newspapers, and it is published by [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], as well as ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', a daily dedicated to coverage of various sports and currently considered the most widely read daily newspaper in Italy.\nOther local dailies are the general broadsheets ''[[Il Giorno (newspaper)|Il Giorno]]'', ''[[Il Giornale]]'', the Roman Catholic Church-owned ''[[Avvenire]]'', and ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'', a daily business newspaper owned by [[Confindustria]] (the Italian employers' federation). Free daily newspapers include ''[[Leggo]]'' and ''[[Metro Newspapers|Metro]]''.\nMilan is also home to many architecture, art, and fashion periodicals, including ''[[Abitare]]'', ''[[Casabella]]'', ''[[Domus]]'', ''[[Flash Art]]'', ''[[Gioia (magazine)|Gioia]]'', ''[[Grazia]]'', and ''[[Vogue Italia]]''. ''[[Panorama]]'' and ''[[Oggi]]'', two of Italy's most important weekly news magazines, are also published in Milan.\n\nSeveral commercial broadcast television networks have their national headquarters in the Milan conurbation, including [[Mediaset]] Group (owner of [[Canale 5]], [[Italia 1]], [[Iris (TV channel)|Iris]] and [[Rete 4]]), [[Telelombardia]] and [[MTV Italy]]. National radio stations based in Milan include [[Radio Deejay]], [[Radio 105 Network]], [[R101 (Italy)]], [[Radio Popolare]], [[RTL 102.5]], [[Radio Capital]] and [[Virgin Radio Italia]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{main article|Lombard cuisine}}\n[[File:Panettone - Nicolettone 2017 - IMG 7085 (31752542285).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Panettone]]'' is Milan's traditional Christmas cake.]]\n[[File:GorgonzolaDSC4233.jpg|thumb|''[[Gorgonzola]]'' is a veined Milanese blue cheese.]]\nLike most cities in Italy, Milan has developed its own local culinary tradition, which, as it is typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently [[rice]] than [[pasta]], [[butter]] than [[vegetable oil]] and features almost no [[tomato]] or [[Fish as food|fish]]. Milanese traditional dishes includes ''[[cotoletta|cotoletta alla milanese]],'' a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese [[Wiener Schnitzel]]). Other typical dishes are ''[[cassoeula]]'' (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with [[Cabbage|Savoy cabbage]]), ''[[ossobuco]]'' (braised [[veal]] shank served with a condiment called ''[[gremolata]]''), [[risotto|risotto alla milanese]] (with [[saffron]] and beef marrow), ''busecca'' (stewed [[tripe]] with beans), and ''brasato'' (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes).\n\nSeason-related pastries include ''chiacchiere'' (flat fritters dusted with sugar) and ''tortelli'' (fried spherical cookies) for [[Carnival]], ''colomba'' (glazed cake shaped as a dove) for [[Easter]], ''pane dei morti'' (\"bread of the (Day of the ) Dead\", cookies flavoured with [[cinnamon]]) for [[All Souls' Day]] and [[panettone]] for Christmas. The ''salame Milano'', a [[salami]] with a very fine grain, is widespread throughout Italy.

In the summer of 569 the [[Lombards]] (from which the name of the Italian region [[Lombardy]] derives), conquered Milan, overpowering the small [[Byzantine army|Byzantine garrison]] left for its defence. Some Roman structures remained in use in Milan under Lombard rule.<ref>See the ''[[Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis]]''.</ref> Milan surrendered to [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Franks]] in 774.\n\nThe 11th century saw a reaction against the control of the German emperors.

It did not take long, however, for the City States to begin fighting each other to try to limit neighbouring powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/tur/en/arteecultura/storia|title=Milan: a history of greatness, from its origins to the twentieth century|website=Portale per il Turismo del Comune di Milano|language=en|access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref> The Milanese destroyed Lodi and continuously warred with Pavia, Cremona and Como, who in turn asked the Emperor of Germany, Frederick I Barbarossa for help.

As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1447 [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]] was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city.<ref name=\"lucas:268\">Henry S.

The king's cousin, [[Louis XII|Louis of Orl\u00e9ans]], took part in the expedition and realized Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to [[Italian Wars|come back a few years later]] in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] family. At that time, Milan was also defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor Fran\u00e7ois I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignan]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[Fran\u00e7ois I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]]. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated Fran\u00e7ois I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, [[northern Italy]], including Milan, passed to [[Hapsburg Spain|Habsburg Spain]].<ref>John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.</ref>\n\nIn 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629\u20131631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629\u201331, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his masterpiece \"[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]\". This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague that began with the [[Black Death]].<ref>Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.</ref>\n\nIn 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]] to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Siege of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713\u20131714 the Treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan.\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\n[[File:Cinque giornate di Milano.jpg|thumb|Popular print depicting the \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" uprising against Austrian rule.]]\n\nOn March 18th, 1848 Milan efficaciously rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" ({{lang-it|Le Cinque Giornate}}), that forced Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering kingdom of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] sent troops in order to protect the insurgents and organsied a [[plebiscite]] that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont-Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy.  About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as Cavour, Garibaldi and Mazzini were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] in order to defeat Austria and estabilish a large Italian state in the region. At the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the [[Quadrilatero|Quadrilateral line]].<ref name=\"Solferino\">{{cite web|title=Solferino |author=Graham J.

A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard]] (1882) and [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon]] (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the [[Orient Express]] that started operating from 1919. Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading financial centre. Very rapid industrialization in the last two decades of the 1800s led to the birth of a massive worker class as well as bitter social conflicts. In May 1898 Milan was shaken by the [[Bava Beccaris massacre]], a riot related to soaring cost of living. \n\n[[File:Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (bombardata) 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] destroyed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings, 1943.]]\n[[File:MI-Milano-1961-piazza-Duca-d-Aosta.jpg|thumb|[[Pirelli Tower]], here in a 1961 picture, became the symbol of the modernity and audacity of the [[Italian economic miracle]].]]\n\nMilan's economic dominance in Italy secured also a leading role for the city on the political scene.

The [[Triennale]] is a design museum and events venue located in Palazzo dell'Arte, in Sempione Park. It hosts exhibitions and events highlighting contemporary Italian design, urban planning, architecture, music, and media arts, emphasising the relationship between art and industry.\n\nMilan in the 20th century was the epicentre of the [[Futurism|Futurist]] artistic movement. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Filippo Marinetti]], the founder of Italian [[Futurism]] wrote in his 1909 \"''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]''\" (in Italian, ''Manifesto Futuristico''), that Milan was \"''grande...tradizionale e futurista''\" (\"''grand...traditional and futuristic''\", in English). [[Umberto Boccioni]] was also an important [[Futurism]] artist who worked in the city. Today, Milan remains a major international hub of modern and contemporary art, with numerous modern art galleries.

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare Beccaria|Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caff\u00e8'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration.\n\nIn the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Here, too, [[Giuseppe Parini]], and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'' was inspired by a Napoleonic law that\u2014against the will of many of its inhabitants\u2014was being extended to the city.\n\nIn the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period [[Carlo Porta]], reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in [[Lombard Language]]. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.\n\nAfter the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to an Italian movement, ''[[Verismo]]''. The greatest ''verista'' novelist, [[Giovanni Verga]], was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.\n\nIn addition to Italian, approximately 2 million people in the Milan metropolitan area can speak the [[Milanese dialect]] or one of its [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard]] variations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coluzzi|first1=Paolo|title=Minority language planning and micronationalism in Italy : an analysis of the situation of Friulian, Cimbrian and Western Lombard with reference to Spanish minority languages|date=2007|publisher=New York|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3039110414|page=260}}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nMilan is an important national and international media centre. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', founded in 1876, is one of the oldest Italian newspapers, and it is published by [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], as well as ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', a daily dedicated to coverage of various sports and currently considered the most widely read daily newspaper in Italy.\nOther local dailies are the general broadsheets ''[[Il Giorno (newspaper)|Il Giorno]]'', ''[[Il Giornale]]'', the Roman Catholic Church-owned ''[[Avvenire]]'', and ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'', a daily business newspaper owned by [[Confindustria]] (the Italian employers' federation). Free daily newspapers include ''[[Leggo]]'' and ''[[Metro Newspapers|Metro]]''.\nMilan is also home to many architecture, art, and fashion periodicals, including ''[[Abitare]]'', ''[[Casabella]]'', ''[[Domus]]'', ''[[Flash Art]]'', ''[[Gioia (magazine)|Gioia]]'', ''[[Grazia]]'', and ''[[Vogue Italia]]''. ''[[Panorama]]'' and ''[[Oggi]]'', two of Italy's most important weekly news magazines, are also published in Milan.\n\nSeveral commercial broadcast television networks have their national headquarters in the Milan conurbation, including [[Mediaset]] Group (owner of [[Canale 5]], [[Italia 1]], [[Iris (TV channel)|Iris]] and [[Rete 4]]), [[Telelombardia]] and [[MTV Italy]]. National radio stations based in Milan include [[Radio Deejay]], [[Radio 105 Network]], [[R101 (Italy)]], [[Radio Popolare]], [[RTL 102.5]], [[Radio Capital]] and [[Virgin Radio Italia]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{main article|Lombard cuisine}}\n[[File:Panettone - Nicolettone 2017 - IMG 7085 (31752542285).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Panettone]]'' is Milan's traditional Christmas cake.]]\n[[File:GorgonzolaDSC4233.jpg|thumb|''[[Gorgonzola]]'' is a veined Milanese blue cheese.]]\nLike most cities in Italy, Milan has developed its own local culinary tradition, which, as it is typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently [[rice]] than [[pasta]], [[butter]] than [[vegetable oil]] and features almost no [[tomato]] or [[Fish as food|fish]]. Milanese traditional dishes includes ''[[cotoletta|cotoletta alla milanese]],'' a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese [[Wiener Schnitzel]]). Other typical dishes are ''[[cassoeula]]'' (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with [[Cabbage|Savoy cabbage]]), ''[[ossobuco]]'' (braised [[veal]] shank served with a condiment called ''[[gremolata]]''), [[risotto|risotto alla milanese]] (with [[saffron]] and beef marrow), ''busecca'' (stewed [[tripe]] with beans), and ''brasato'' (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes).\n\nSeason-related pastries include ''chiacchiere'' (flat fritters dusted with sugar) and ''tortelli'' (fried spherical cookies) for [[Carnival]], ''colomba'' (glazed cake shaped as a dove) for [[Easter]], ''pane dei morti'' (\"bread of the (Day of the ) Dead\", cookies flavoured with [[cinnamon]]) for [[All Souls' Day]] and [[panettone]] for Christmas. The ''salame Milano'', a [[salami]] with a very fine grain, is widespread throughout Italy.

The embellishment turns into a web of lies when Lisa is chosen to represent the school and her \"people\" at City Hall, then as a keynote speaker for the National Native American Tribal Council. She eventually admits she lied about her heritage, but is spared from prosecution when the other speakers admit they are not true Native Americans.

Bart is cheered as a hero by everyone and rewarded with a driver's license by [[Mayor Quimby]].\n\nBart starts using [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s car for his own pleasure, but is eventually tabbed for family errands, mostly chauffeuring Homer. After many inappropriate requests, Bart flees to [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#North Haverbrook|North Haverbrook]], where he meets a 15-year-old girl named Darcy, who believes Bart is much older. They begin a romantic relationship and Darcy soon proposes marriage. At the court house, Bart reveals his age, whereupon Darcy reveals that she is pregnant, much to Bart's depression. Darcy admits that Bart is not the father as they have not consummated the relationship - the real father is a Norwegian exchange student, and she wants to get married because her parents would be upset about her extramarital pregnancy. Bart agrees to marry Darcy, and they drive to Utah, where marriage restrictions are looser and they can start a new life together. Eventually, Homer, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and Darcy's parents catch up with them to stop the wedding, where Darcy's father tries to reason with Bart as he believes that Bart took advantage of a girl much older than him and got her pregnant. Darcy confesses to her parents that Bart is not the father, and that she didn't want her parents to be disappointed by her pregnancy. Darcy's mother, thrilled, confesses that she is pregnant too, and the family agrees to pass the two babies off as twins. Darcy and Bart end their relationship, while Bart assures her they will meet again, to which she agrees.
