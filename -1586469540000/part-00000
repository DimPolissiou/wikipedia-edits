Wapping's proximity to the river has given it a strong maritime character, which it retains through its riverside [[public house]]s and steps, such as the [[Prospect of Whitby]] and Wapping Stairs. It also has a [[Royal Navy]] shore establishment base on the riverfront called [[HMS President (shore establishment)|HMS President]] and home to [[Tobacco Dock]] and [[King Edward Memorial Park]].\n\nMany of the original buildings were demolished during the construction of the [[London Docks]] and Wapping was further seriously damaged during [[the Blitz]]. As the [[London Docklands]] declined after the [[Second World War]], the area became run down, with the great warehouses left empty. The area's fortunes were transformed during the 1980s by the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] when the warehouses started to be converted into luxury flats.\n\n[[Rupert Murdoch]] moved his [[News International]] printing and publishing works into Wapping in 1986, resulting in a trade union dispute that became known as the \"[[Wapping dispute|Battle of Wapping]]\".\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Stepney Civil Parish Map 1870.png|thumb|right|250px|A map showing the civil parish boundaries in 1870.]]\n\nFormerly it was believed that the name Wapping recorded an Anglo-Saxon settlement linked to a personal name ''Waeppa'' (as if to say \"the settlement of Waeppa's people\".<ref>Waeppa's People - a History of Wapping by Madge Darby - {{ISBN|0-947699-10-4}}</ref>) More recent scholarship discounts that theory: the area was marshland, where early settlement was unlikely, and no such personal name has ever been found.

This gave it a peculiarly narrow and constricted shape, consisting of little more than the axis of Wapping High Street and some north\u2013south side streets.

It was inhabited by sailors, mastmakers, boat-builders, blockmakers, instrument-makers, victuallers and representatives of all the other trades that supported the seafarer. Wapping was also the site of '[[Execution Dock]]', where [[pirates]] and other water-borne criminals faced [[execution (legal)|execution]] by [[hanging]] from a [[gibbet]] constructed close to the low water mark. Their bodies would be left dangling until they had been submerged three times by the tide.<ref name=brit/>\n\nThe Bell Inn, by the execution dock, was run by Samuel Batts, whose daughter, [[Elizabeth Batts Cook|Elizabeth]], married [[James Cook]] at [[St Margaret's Church, Barking]], Essex on 21 December 1762, after the [[Royal Navy]] captain had stayed at the Inn.<ref>''Famous 18th century people of Barking and Dagenham'' Info Sheet #22, LB Barking & Dagenham</ref> The couple initially settled in [[Shadwell]], attending [[St Paul's Church, Shadwell|St Paul's church]], but later moved to [[Mile End]].

Wapping's population plummeted by nearly 60% during that century, with many houses destroyed by the construction of the docks and giant warehouses along the riverfront. Squeezed between the high walls of the docks and warehouses, the district became isolated from the rest of London, although some relief was provided by Brunel's [[Thames Tunnel]] to [[Rotherhithe]]. The opening of  [[Wapping tube station]] on the [[East London Line]] in 1869 provided a direct rail link to the rest of London.<ref name=Rose>{{harvnb|Rose|2007}}</ref><ref name=Rose/><ref name=\"Day 1979 32\">{{harvnb|Day|1979|p=32}}</ref>\n\n===Modern times===\n[[File:Gun Wharves, Wapping, luxury flats.jpg|thumb|right|Gun Wharves, Wapping.

The London Docks were largely filled in and redeveloped with a variety of commercial, light industrial and residential properties.\n\nSt John's Church (1756) was located on what is now Scandrett Street.

This became the scene of violent protests after News International's UK operation moved from [[Fleet Street]] to Wapping, with over 5,000 print workers being sacked when new technology was introduced.\n\n==Wapping dispute==\n{{Main|Wapping dispute}}\nThe \"Wapping dispute\" or \"Battle of Wapping\" was, along with the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|miners' strike of 1984-85]], a significant turning point in the history of the [[trade union]] movement and of UK industrial relations. It started on 24 January 1986 when some 6,000 newspaper workers went on strike after protracted negotiation with their employer, [[News International]] (parent of Times Newspapers and News Group Newspapers, and chaired by [[Rupert Murdoch]]). News International had built and clandestinely equipped a new printing plant for all its titles in Wapping, and when the print unions announced a strike it activated this new plant with the assistance of the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union]] (EETPU).\n\nThe plant was nicknamed \"Fortress Wapping\" when the sacked print workers effectively besieged it, mounting round-the-clock pickets and blockades in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to thwart the move. In 2005, News International announced the intention to move the print works to regional presses based in [[Broxbourne]] (the world's largest printing plant, opened March 2008),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7299941.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - World's biggest print plant opens|publisher=}}</ref> [[Liverpool]] and [[Glasgow]].

A number of the '[[watermen's stairs]]', such as Wapping Old Stairs and Pelican Stairs (by the Prospect of Whitby) give public access to a [[littoral]] zone (for the Thames is tidal at this point) littered with flotsam, jetsam and fragments of old dock installations. The area is popular with amateur archaeologists and treasure hunters. This activity is known as [[mudlark]]ing; the term for a shore scavenger in the 18th and 19th centuries was a mudlark.\n\nSt George in the East on Cannon Street Road is one of six [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor]] churches in London, built from 1714 to 1729, with funding from the [[Commission for Building Fifty New Churches]]. The church was hit by a bomb during [[the Blitz]] the original interior was destroyed by the fire, but the walls and distinctive \"pepper-pot\" towers remained intact.  In 1964 a modern church interior was constructed inside the existing walls for the active congregation, and a new flat built under each corner tower. Behind the church lies St George's Gardens, the original cemetery, which was passed to Stepney Council to maintain as a public park in mid-Victorian times. At the outbreak of the Second World War the [[crypt]] of the church was used as a [[Air-raid shelter|public air raid shelter]] and was fully occupied when the aforementioned bomb struck. There were no casualties and everyone was evacuated safely (thanks to the [[Air Raid Warden|air raid wardens]] and [[fire brigade]]).\n\n[[File:PirateWapping.JPG|thumb|Wax figure of a pirate hanged at [[Execution Dock]].

It was used by the [[Admiralty]] for over 400 years (as late as 1830) to hang [[pirates]] that had been convicted and sentenced to death by the [[Admiralty court]]. The Admiralty only had jurisdiction over crimes on the sea, so the dock was located within their jurisdiction by being located far enough offshore as to be beyond the low-tide mark.

It was constructed in approximately 1811 and served primarily as a store for imported tobacco. In 1990 it was converted into a shopping centre at a development cost of \u00a347 million with the intention to create the \"[[Covent Garden]] of the East End\"; the scheme was unsuccessful, though, and went into administration. Since the mid-1990s the building has been almost entirely unoccupied. It is now occasionally used for filming, and for large corporate and commercial events.\n\n[[File:Wapping gibbet 1.jpg|thumb|left|Though [[Execution Dock]] is long gone, this gibbet is still maintained on the Thames foreshore by the Prospect of Whitby public house]]\nThree venerable [[public house]]s are located near the Stairs.

Wapping's proximity to the river has given it a strong maritime character, which it retains through its riverside [[public house]]s and steps, such as the [[Prospect of Whitby]] and Wapping Stairs. It also has a [[Royal Navy]] shore establishment base on the riverfront called [[HMS President (shore establishment)|HMS President]] and home to [[Tobacco Dock]] and [[King Edward Memorial Park]].\n\nMany of the original buildings were demolished during the construction of the [[London Docks]] and Wapping was further seriously damaged during [[the Blitz]]. As the [[London Docklands]] declined after the [[Second World War]], the area became run down, with the great warehouses left empty. The area's fortunes were transformed during the 1980s by the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] when the warehouses started to be converted into luxury flats.\n\n[[Rupert Murdoch]] moved his [[News International]] printing and publishing works into Wapping in 1986, resulting in a trade union dispute that became known as the \"[[Wapping dispute|Battle of Wapping]]\".\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Stepney Civil Parish Map 1870.png|thumb|right|250px|A map showing the civil parish boundaries in 1870.]]\n\nFormerly it was believed that the name Wapping recorded an Anglo-Saxon settlement linked to a personal name ''Waeppa'' (as if to say \"the settlement of Waeppa's people\".<ref>Waeppa's People - a History of Wapping by Madge Darby - {{ISBN|0-947699-10-4}}</ref>) More recent scholarship discounts that theory: the area was marshland, where early settlement was unlikely, and no such personal name has ever been found.

It was inhabited by sailors, mastmakers, boat-builders, blockmakers, instrument-makers, victuallers and representatives of all the other trades that supported the seafarer. Wapping was also the site of '[[Execution Dock]]', where [[pirates]] and other water-borne criminals faced [[execution (legal)|execution]] by [[hanging]] from a [[gibbet]] constructed close to the low water mark. Their bodies would be left dangling until they had been submerged three times by the tide.<ref name=brit/>\n\nThe Bell Inn, by the execution dock, was run by Samuel Batts, whose daughter, [[Elizabeth Batts Cook|Elizabeth]], married [[James Cook]] at [[St Margaret's Church, Barking]], Essex on 21 December 1762, after the [[Royal Navy]] captain had stayed at the Inn.<ref>''Famous 18th century people of Barking and Dagenham'' Info Sheet #22, LB Barking & Dagenham</ref> The couple initially settled in [[Shadwell]], attending [[St Paul's Church, Shadwell|St Paul's church]], but later moved to [[Mile End]].

Wapping's population plummeted by nearly 60% during that century, with many houses destroyed by the construction of the docks and giant warehouses along the riverfront. Squeezed between the high walls of the docks and warehouses, the district became isolated from the rest of London, although some relief was provided by Brunel's [[Thames Tunnel]] to [[Rotherhithe]].

It started on 24 January 1986 when some 6,000 newspaper workers went on strike after protracted negotiation with their employer, [[News International]] (parent of Times Newspapers and News Group Newspapers, and chaired by [[Rupert Murdoch]]). News International had built and clandestinely equipped a new printing plant for all its titles in Wapping, and when the print unions announced a strike it activated this new plant with the assistance of the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union]] (EETPU).\n\nThe plant was nicknamed \"Fortress Wapping\" when the sacked print workers effectively besieged it, mounting round-the-clock pickets and blockades in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to thwart the move.

A number of the '[[watermen's stairs]]', such as Wapping Old Stairs and Pelican Stairs (by the Prospect of Whitby) give public access to a [[littoral]] zone (for the Thames is tidal at this point) littered with flotsam, jetsam and fragments of old dock installations. The area is popular with amateur archaeologists and treasure hunters. This activity is known as [[Mudlark|mudlarking]]; the term for a shore scavenger in the 18th and 19th centuries was a mudlark.\n\nSt George in the East on Cannon Street Road is one of six [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor]] churches in London, built from 1714 to 1729, with funding from the [[Commission for Building Fifty New Churches]]. The church was hit by a bomb during [[the Blitz]] the original interior was destroyed by the fire, but the walls and distinctive \"pepper-pot\" towers remained intact.  In 1964 a modern church interior was constructed inside the existing walls for the active congregation, and a new flat built under each corner tower. Behind the church lies St George's Gardens, the original cemetery, which was passed to Stepney Council to maintain as a public park in mid-Victorian times. At the outbreak of the Second World War the [[crypt]] of the church was used as a [[Air-raid shelter|public air raid shelter]] and was fully occupied when the aforementioned bomb struck. There were no casualties and everyone was evacuated safely (thanks to the [[Air Raid Warden|air raid wardens]] and [[fire brigade]]).\n\n[[File:PirateWapping.JPG|thumb|Wax figure of a pirate hanged at [[Execution Dock]].

Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of [[corporate social responsibility]], published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from [[Oxfam]], the [[World Food Programme]], [[United Nations Global Compact]], the Chairman of [[BT Group]], an ex-Director of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and the UK [[Institute of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/542754|title=Compilation: Full text of responses to Economist survey on Corporate Social Responsibility (January\u2013February 2005)|work=Business & Human Rights|accessdate=3 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nMany of the letters published are critical of its stance or commentary. After ''The Economist'' ran a critique of [[Amnesty International]] and human rights in general in its issue dated 24 March 2007, its letters page ran a reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8954694|title=Letters: On Amnesty International and human rights, Iraq, tax breaks 4&nbsp;April 2007|date=4 April 2007|work=The Economist|accessdate=9 November 2007}}</ref> Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local [[right-of-reply]] laws without compromising editorial independence.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis T.

The town had a population of 55,715 in [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011]].\n\nThe town was originally established on the [[River Mersey]] at the entrance to the [[Ellesmere Canal]].  As well as a service sector economy, it has retained large industries including [[Stanlow Refinery|Stanlow]] oil refinery, a chemical works and the [[Vauxhall Motors]] car factory. There are also a number of tourist attractions including the [[National Waterways Museum, Ellesmere Port|National Waterways Museum]], the [[Blue Planet Aquarium]] and [[Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet]].\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ellesmere-port-stanlow.jpg|left|thumb|\n[[Ellesmere Port Dock]] at the [[Manchester ship canal]] looking towards the [[Stanlow Refinery]] ]]\nThe town of Ellesmere Port was founded at the outlet of the never completed [[Ellesmere Canal]]. The canal now renamed was designed and engineered by [[William Jessop]] and [[Thomas Telford]] as part of a project to connect the rivers [[River Severn|Severn]], [[River Mersey|Mersey]] and [[River Dee, Wales|Dee]]. The canal was intended to be completed in sections. In 1795 the section between the River Mersey at [[Netherpool]] and the River Dee at [[Chester]] was opened. However the canal was not finished as first intended; it never reached the River Severn. Upon reevaluation it was decided that the costs to complete the project were not projected to be repaid because of a decrease in expected commercial traffic. There had been a loss of competitive advantage caused by steam engine-related economic advances (nationally, regionally and locally) during the first decade of canal construction. During or before the construction of the canal the village of Netherpool changed its name to the Port of Ellesmere, and by the early 19th century, to Ellesmere Port.\n\nSettlements had existed in the area since the writing of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' in the 11th century, which mentions [[Great Sutton]], [[Little Sutton, Cheshire|Little Sutton]], Pool<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opendomesday.org/place/XX0000/nether-and-over-pool/|title=Place: [Nether and Over] Pool|work=Open Domesday|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref> (now [[Overpool]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/compress/cu31924028139339/formats=ARCHIVE%20BITTORRENT,RAW%20CORNELL%20BOOK%20ZIP,DUBLIN%20CORE,METADATA,MARC,MARC%20BINARY|title=The place-names of the Liverpool district; or, the history and meaning of the local and river names of south-west Lancashire and of Wirral|first=Henry|last=Harrison|publisher=Elliot Stock|year=1898|accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>) and [[Hooton, Cheshire|Hooton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheshirearchaeology.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HTS_Arch_Assess_EllesmerePort.pdf |title=Chershire Historic Towns Survey, Ellesmere Port, Archaeological Assessment |work=Cheshire County Council |year=2003 |accessdate=1 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208130423/http://www.cheshirearchaeology.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HTS_Arch_Assess_EllesmerePort.pdf |archivedate=8 December 2015  }}</ref> The first houses in Ellesmere Port itself, however, grew up around the docks and the first main street was Dock Street, which now houses the National Waterways Museum. Station Road, which connected the docks with the village of Whitby, also gradually developed and as more shops were needed, some of the houses became retail premises. As the expanding industrial areas growing up around the canal and its docks attracted more workers to the area, the town itself continued to expand. Whitby was a township in the ancient parishes of Eastham and Stoak, Wirral hundred, which became a civil parish in 1866. It included the hamlets of Ellesmere Port and Whitbyheath. To enhance the economic growth of the area, the Netherpool, Overpool and Whitby civil parishes were abolished on 1 April 1911 to become parts of the new civil parish of Ellesmere Port.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/genuki/chs/whitby.html|work=GenUKI|title=Whitby|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ellesmere-port-lighthouse-1.jpg|thumb|Whitby lighthouse]]\nBy the mid-20th century, thanks to the opening of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in 1894 and the Stanlow Oil Refinery in the 1920s, Ellesmere Port had expanded so that it now incorporated the villages of Great and Little Sutton, Hooton, Whitby, Overpool and Rivacre as suburbs. The town centre itself had moved from the Station Road/Dock Street area, to an area that had once been home to a [[stud farm]] (indeed, the former [[Ellesmere Port and Neston]] Borough Council officially referred to the town centre as Stud Farm for housing allocation purposes) around the crossroads of Sutton Way/Stanney Lane and Whitby Road.\n\nIn the 20th century, a number of new housing estates were developed, many of them on the sites of former farms such as Hope Farm and Grange Farm. Many estates consisted of both [[council housing]] and privately owned houses and flats.\n\nEllesmere Port, in more recent times has had an influx of [[Liverpool]] immigrants. Thus demand for housing increased with the opening of the [[Vauxhall Motors]] [[Vauxhall Ellesmere Port|car plant]] in 1962. Opened as a components supplier to the [[Luton]] plant, passenger car production began in 1964 with the [[Vauxhall Viva (1963\u20131979)|Vauxhall Viva]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factorytour.co.uk/ellesmereport/ |title=Ellesmere Port car factory- Vauxhall, Opel |publisher=Factorytour.co.uk |accessdate=20 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314155901/http://www.factorytour.co.uk/ellesmereport/ |archivedate=14 March 2012  }}</ref> The plant is now Vauxhall's only car factory in [[UK|Britain]], since the end of passenger car production at the Luton plant in 2004 (where commercial vehicles are still made). Ellesmere Port currently produces the [[Vauxhall Astra]] model on two shifts, employing 2,500 people.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the Port Arcades, a covered [[shopping mall]] was built in the town centre. By the 1990s, it was the retail sector rather than the industrial that was attracting workers and their families to the town. This was boosted with the building of the Cheshire Oaks outlet village and the Coliseum shopping park, which also included a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema; prior to this since the closure of the cinema in Station Road, Little Sutton (King's cinema) and the Queen's cinema adjacent to Ellesmere Port railway station in the 1960s the town's only cinema had been a single screen in the EPIC Leisure Centre.\n\nSince 1974 Ellesmere Port has been an [[unparished area]] when the civil parish of Ellesmere Port was abolished and all its functions were assumed by the new district of [[Ellesmere Port and Neston]].  The district was abolished in 2009, and the town no longer has its own council.\n\nThe town continues to grow, and more housing estates and shops are being built.  The industrial sector is still a major employer in the town although in recent years, a number of factories have been closed and jobs lost. [[Marks & Spencer]] have built (September 2012) what is being claimed to be their largest store apart from Marble Arch on a site opposite to the Coliseum shopping park.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Ellesmere Port Civic Hall.jpg|thumb|Civic Hall]]\n\nEllesmere Port was nearly included into the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral]], in [[Merseyside]], when that was formed on 1 April 1974. It was removed from the proposals before the [[Local Government Act 1972]] had its first reading, and instead remained in Cheshire as part of the borough of [[Ellesmere Port and Neston]].\n\nPlans were announced which proposed combining the borough of Ellesmere Port and Neston with the [[Chester (district)|Chester]] and [[Vale Royal]] districts to form a new \"West Cheshire\" [[unitary authority]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ellesmereport-neston.gov.uk/feature.htm?item=32 |title=Future of local government in Cheshire |publisher=Ellesmere Port & Neston Borough Council |accessdate=27 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928221718/http://www.ellesmereport-neston.gov.uk/feature.htm?item=32 |archivedate=28 September 2007  }}</ref> The new unitary authority came into being on 1 April 2009 as [[Cheshire West and Chester]]. The Conservatives won control of this council in shadow elections in May 2008, winning a majority of seats in the Ellesmere Port area for the first time.\n\nAt the national level, Ellesmere Port is part of the [[Ellesmere Port and Neston (UK Parliament constituency)|Ellesmere Port and Neston]] parliament constituency.

Ellesmere Port Gunners raced in the lower tier Leagues. The Gunners' best season was their last, 1985, when they won the National League championship. Sadly, the campaign was marred by a career-ending injury sustained by inspirational captain Joe Owen. Owen was hurt in a track crash at Birmingham. Ellesmere Port Town F.C. was once of town's main football team before the founding of Vauxhall Motors F.C. in 1963. Ellesmere Port Town F.C. was founded in 1948 and folded in 1973. The club's main achievements were playing in the Northern Premier League (The 7th tier in the English Football Pyramid) and reaching the F.A. Cup First Round in the 1971\u20131972 season, losing 3-0 to Boston United.

The town had a population of 55,715 in [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011]].\n\nThe town was originally established on the [[River Mersey]] at the entrance to the [[Ellesmere Canal]].  As well as a service sector economy, it has retained large industries including [[Stanlow Refinery|Stanlow]] oil refinery, a chemical works and the [[Vauxhall Motors]] car factory. There are also a number of tourist attractions including the [[National Waterways Museum, Ellesmere Port|National Waterways Museum]], the [[Blue Planet Aquarium]] and [[Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet]].\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n==History==\n[[File:Ellesmere-port-stanlow.jpg|left|thumb|\n[[Ellesmere Port Dock]] at the [[Manchester ship canal]] looking towards the [[Stanlow Refinery]] ]]\nThe town of Ellesmere Port was founded at the outlet of the never completed [[Ellesmere Canal]]. The canal now renamed was designed and engineered by [[William Jessop]] and [[Thomas Telford]] as part of a project to connect the rivers [[River Severn|Severn]], [[River Mersey|Mersey]] and [[River Dee, Wales|Dee]]. The canal was intended to be completed in sections. In 1795 the section between the River Mersey at [[Netherpool]] and the River Dee at [[Chester]] was opened. However the canal was not finished as first intended; it never reached the River Severn. Upon reevaluation it was decided that the costs to complete the project were not projected to be repaid because of a decrease in expected commercial traffic. There had been a loss of competitive advantage caused by steam engine-related economic advances (nationally, regionally and locally) during the first decade of canal construction. During or before the construction of the canal the village of Netherpool changed its name to the Port of Ellesmere, and by the early 19th century, to Ellesmere Port.\n\nSettlements had existed in the area since the writing of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' in the 11th century, which mentions [[Great Sutton]], [[Little Sutton, Cheshire|Little Sutton]], Pool<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opendomesday.org/place/XX0000/nether-and-over-pool/|title=Place: [Nether and Over] Pool|work=Open Domesday|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref> (now [[Overpool]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/compress/cu31924028139339/formats=ARCHIVE%20BITTORRENT,RAW%20CORNELL%20BOOK%20ZIP,DUBLIN%20CORE,METADATA,MARC,MARC%20BINARY|title=The place-names of the Liverpool district; or, the history and meaning of the local and river names of south-west Lancashire and of Wirral|first=Henry|last=Harrison|publisher=Elliot Stock|year=1898|accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>) and [[Hooton, Cheshire|Hooton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheshirearchaeology.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HTS_Arch_Assess_EllesmerePort.pdf |title=Chershire Historic Towns Survey, Ellesmere Port, Archaeological Assessment |work=Cheshire County Council |year=2003 |accessdate=1 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208130423/http://www.cheshirearchaeology.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HTS_Arch_Assess_EllesmerePort.pdf |archivedate=8 December 2015  }}</ref> The first houses in Ellesmere Port itself, however, grew up around the docks and the first main street was Dock Street, which now houses the National Waterways Museum. Station Road, which connected the docks with the village of Whitby, also gradually developed and as more shops were needed, some of the houses became retail premises. As the expanding industrial areas growing up around the canal and its docks attracted more workers to the area, the town itself continued to expand. Whitby was a township in the ancient parishes of Eastham and Stoak, Wirral hundred, which became a civil parish in 1866. It included the hamlets of Ellesmere Port and Whitbyheath. To enhance the economic growth of the area, the Netherpool, Overpool and Whitby civil parishes were abolished on 1 April 1911 to become parts of the new civil parish of Ellesmere Port.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/genuki/chs/whitby.html|work=GenUKI|title=Whitby|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ellesmere-port-lighthouse-1.jpg|thumb|Whitby lighthouse]]\nBy the mid-20th century, thanks to the opening of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in 1894 and the Stanlow Oil Refinery in the 1920s, Ellesmere Port had expanded so that it now incorporated the villages of Great and Little Sutton, Hooton, Whitby, Overpool and Rivacre as suburbs. The town centre itself had moved from the Station Road/Dock Street area, to an area that had once been home to a [[stud farm]] (indeed, the former [[Ellesmere Port and Neston]] Borough Council officially referred to the town centre as Stud Farm for housing allocation purposes) around the crossroads of Sutton Way/Stanney Lane and Whitby Road.\n\nIn the 20th century, a number of new housing estates were developed, many of them on the sites of former farms such as Hope Farm and Grange Farm. Many estates consisted of both [[council housing]] and privately owned houses and flats.\n\nEllesmere Port, in more recent times has had an influx of [[Liverpool]] immigrants. Thus demand for housing increased with the opening of the [[Vauxhall Motors]] [[Vauxhall Ellesmere Port|car plant]] in 1962. Opened as a components supplier to the [[Luton]] plant, passenger car production began in 1964 with the [[Vauxhall Viva (1963\u20131979)|Vauxhall Viva]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factorytour.co.uk/ellesmereport/ |title=Ellesmere Port car factory- Vauxhall, Opel |publisher=Factorytour.co.uk |accessdate=20 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314155901/http://www.factorytour.co.uk/ellesmereport/ |archivedate=14 March 2012  }}</ref> The plant is now Vauxhall's only car factory in [[UK|Britain]], since the end of passenger car production at the Luton plant in 2004 (where commercial vehicles are still made). Ellesmere Port currently produces the [[Vauxhall Astra]] model on two shifts, employing 2,500 people.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the Port Arcades, a covered [[shopping mall]] was built in the town centre. By the 1990s, it was the retail sector rather than the industrial that was attracting workers and their families to the town. This was boosted with the building of the Cheshire Oaks outlet village and the Coliseum shopping park, which also included a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema; prior to this since the closure of the cinema in Station Road, Little Sutton (King's cinema) and the Queen's cinema adjacent to Ellesmere Port railway station in the 1960s the town's only cinema had been a single screen in the EPIC Leisure Centre.\n\nSince 1974 Ellesmere Port has been an [[unparished area]] when the civil parish of Ellesmere Port was abolished and all its functions were assumed by the new district of [[Ellesmere Port and Neston]].  The district was abolished in 2009, and the town no longer has its own council.\n\nThe town continues to grow, and more housing estates and shops are being built.  The industrial sector is still a major employer in the town although in recent years, a number of factories have been closed and jobs lost. [[Marks & Spencer]] have built (September 2012) what is being claimed to be their largest store apart from Marble Arch on a site opposite to the Coliseum shopping park.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Ellesmere Port Civic Hall.jpg|thumb|Civic Hall]]\n\nEllesmere Port was nearly included into the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral]], in [[Merseyside]], when that was formed on 1 April 1974. It was removed from the proposals before the [[Local Government Act 1972]] had its first reading, and instead remained in Cheshire as part of the borough of [[Ellesmere Port and Neston]].\n\nPlans were announced which proposed combining the borough of Ellesmere Port and Neston with the [[Chester (district)|Chester]] and [[Vale Royal]] districts to form a new \"West Cheshire\" [[unitary authority]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ellesmereport-neston.gov.uk/feature.htm?item=32 |title=Future of local government in Cheshire |publisher=Ellesmere Port & Neston Borough Council |accessdate=27 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928221718/http://www.ellesmereport-neston.gov.uk/feature.htm?item=32 |archivedate=28 September 2007  }}</ref> The new unitary authority came into being on 1 April 2009 as [[Cheshire West and Chester]].

Ellesmere Port Gunners raced in the lower tier Leagues. The Gunners' best season was their last, 1985, when they won the National League championship. Sadly, the campaign was marred by a career-ending injury sustained by inspirational captain Joe Owen. Owen was hurt in a track crash at Birmingham. Ellesmere Port Town F.C. was once of town's main football team before the founding of Vauxhall Motors F.C. in 1963. Ellesmere Port Town F.C. was founded in 1948 and folded in 1973.
