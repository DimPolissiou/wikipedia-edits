Located in the low-lying delta region along the river, its outlying areas were developed as cotton plantations, and the city became a major cotton market and brokerage center.\n\nThe cotton economy of the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] South depended on the forced labor of large numbers of [[Slavery in the United States|African-American slaves]], and Memphis also developed as a major slave market for the domestic slave trade. Through the early 19th century, one million slaves were transported from the Upper South, in a huge forced migration to newly developed plantation areas in the Deep South. Many were transported by steamboats along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. In 1857, the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]] was completed, connecting the Atlantic Coast of South Carolina and this major Mississippi River port; it was the only east-west railroad constructed across the southern states prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. This gave planters and cotton brokers access to the Atlantic Coast for shipping cotton to England, a major market.\n\nThe city's demographics changed dramatically in the 1850s and 1860s under waves of immigration and domestic migration. Due to increased immigration since the 1840s and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], ethnic Irish made up 9.9 percent of the population in 1850, but 23.2 percent in 1860, when the total population was 22,623.<ref>Carriere, Marius.

They also gained many elected and patronage positions in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] city government, and an Irish man was elected as mayor before the Civil War. At that time, representatives were elected to the city council from 30 wards. The elite were worried about corruption in this system and that so many saloonkeepers were active in the wards. German immigrants also made this city a destination following the 1848 revolutions; both the Irish and German immigrants were mostly Catholic, adding another element to demographic change in this formerly Protestant city.\n\n[[File:Forrest Memphis Raid.jpg|thumb|Attack on [[Irving Block prison|Irving Block]] by General Forrest in 1864]]\n\n[[Tennessee#History|Tennessee]] seceded from the [[United States|Union]] in June 1861, and Memphis briefly became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] stronghold. [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Ironclad warship|ironclad gunboats]] captured the city in the naval [[Battle of Memphis]] on June 6, 1862, and the city and state were occupied by the [[Union Army]] for the duration of the war. The Union Army commanders allowed the city to maintain its civil government during most of this period but excluded Confederate veterans from office, which shifted political dynamics in the city as the war went on.<ref name=\"carden\">[http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/publication/WP1040_An%20Unrighteous%20Piece%20of%20Business.pdf Art Carden and Christopher J.

Meanwhile, Confederate General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] harassed Union forces in the area.\n\nThe war years contributed to additional dramatic changes in city population. The presence of the Union Army attracted many fugitive slaves who escaped from surrounding rural plantations. So many sought protection behind Union lines that the Army set up [[contraband]] camps to accommodate them. The black population of Memphis increased from 3,000 in 1860, when the total population was 22,623, to nearly 20,000 in 1865, with most settling south of what was then the city limits.<ref name=\"Ryan\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716953 Ryan, James G.

After race riots against the blacks in 1866, thousands left the city. The total population in 1870 was 40,220; the number of blacks had declined to 15,000 that year, or 37.4% of the total.(See census table in Demographics section.)\n\n===Postwar years, Reconstruction and Democratic control===\nThe rapid demographic changes, added to the stress of war and occupation, and uncertainty about who was in charge, resulted in growing tensions between the Irish policemen and black Union soldiers following the war.<ref name=\"carden\"/> In three days of rioting in early May 1866, the [[Memphis Riots of 1866|Memphis Riot]] erupted, in which white mobs made up of policemen, firemen, and other mostly ethnic [[Irish Americans]], attacked and killed 46 blacks, wounding 75 and injuring 100 persons; raped several women, and destroyed nearly 100 houses while severely damaging churches and schools in South Memphis. Much of the black settlement was left in ruins. Two whites were killed in the riot.<ref name=\"Ryan\"/> Many blacks permanently fled Memphis after the riot, especially as the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] continued to have difficulty in protecting them. Their population fell to about 15,000 by 1870,<ref name=\"carden\"/> or 37.4% of the city, which then had a total population of 40,226.(See census table in Demographics section.)\n\n[[File:Memphis airview 1870.jpg|thumb|Historic aerial view of Memphis, 1870]]\n\nHistorian Barrington Walker suggests that the Irish rioted against blacks because of their relatively recent arrival as immigrants and the uncertain nature of their own claim to \"whiteness\"; they were trying to separate themselves from blacks in the underclass. The main fighting participants were ethnic Irish, decommissioned black Union soldiers, and newly emancipated [[freedmen]] from the African-American community. Walker suggests that most of the mob were not in direct economic conflict with the blacks, as by then the Irish had attained better jobs, but the Irish were establishing dominance over the freedmen.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nIn Memphis, unlike disturbances in some other cities, ex-Confederate veterans were generally not part of the attacks against blacks. The outrages of the riot in Memphis and a similar one in New Orleans in September (the latter did include Confederate veterans) resulted in support in the North for Congress to pass the [[Reconstruction Act]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]].<ref name=\"Ryan\"/>\n\n===Yellow Jack===\nIn the 1870s, a series of [[yellow fever]] [[epidemic]]s devastated Memphis, with the disease being carried by river passengers along the waterways. During the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878, more than 5000 people were listed in the official register of deaths between July 26 and November 27. The vast majority died of yellow fever, making the epidemic in the city of 40,000 people one of the most traumatic and severe in urban United States' history. Within four days of the Memphis Board of Health's declaration of a yellow fever outbreak, 20,000 residents had fled the city. The panic ensuing left the poverty-stricken, the working classes, and the African-American community at most risk from the epidemic. Those who remained in Memphis relied on volunteers from religious and physician organizations to tend to the sick. By the end of the year, more than 5,000 were confirmed dead in Memphis. The New Orleans health board listed \"not less than 4,600\" dead. The Mississippi Valley recorded 120,000 cases of yellow fever, with 20,000 deaths. The $15 million in losses caused by the epidemic bankrupted the city of Memphis, and as a result its charter was revoked by the state legislature.\n\n[[File:AmCyc Memphis (Tennessee).jpg|thumb|Woodcut representing the waterfront of Memphis, c. 1879]]\nBy 1870, Memphis's population of 40,000 was almost double that of Nashville and Atlanta, and it ranked as the second-largest city in the South after New Orleans.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\">Crosby, Molly Caldwell. ''The American Plague: The Untold Story of Yellow Fever, the Epidemic That Shaped Our History''. New York: [[Berkley Books]], 2006.</ref> The population of Memphis continued to grow after 1870, even when the [[Panic of 1873]] hit the US hard, particularly in the South. The Panic of 1873 resulted in expanding Memphis's underclasses amidst the poverty and hardship wrought by the panic, giving further credence to Memphis as a rough, shiftless city. Leading up to the outbreak in 1878, it had suffered two yellow fever epidemics, cholera, and malaria, which gave Memphis a reputation as a sickly city and a filthy one. It was unheard of for a city with a population as large as that of Memphis not to have any waterworks; the city still relied for supplies entirely on collecting water from the river and rain cisterns, and it had no way to remove sewage.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> The combination of a swelling population, especially of lower and working classes, and the abysmal health and sanitary conditions of Memphis, made the city ripe for a serious epidemic.\n \nThe first case recorded for the public was when Mrs. Kate Bionda, an owner of an Italian \"snack house\", died of the fever on August 13.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> Hers was officially reported by the Board of Health, on August 14, as the first case of yellow fever in the city.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> A massive panic ensued. The same trains and steamboats that brought thousands into Memphis now in five days carried away over 25,000 Memphians, more than half of the population.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> On August 23, the Board of Health finally declared a yellow fever epidemic in Memphis, and the city collapsed, hemorrhaging its population. In July of that year, the city boasted a population of 47,000. By September, 19,000 remained and 17,000 of them had yellow fever.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> The only people left in the city were the lower classes, such as German and Irish immigrant workers, and African Americans. None had the means to flee the city, as did the middle and upper class whites of Memphis, and thus they were subjected to a city of death. \n \nImmediately following the Board of Health's declaration, a Citizen's Relief Committee was formed by Charles G. Fisher. It organized the city into refugee camps. The committee's main priority was separating the poor from the city and isolating them into refugee camps.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> Also, the Howard Association, formed specifically for yellow fever epidemics in New Orleans and Memphis, organized nurses and doctors within Memphis and throughout the country in response to the outbreak.<ref name=\"Hicks, Mildred 1964\">Hicks, Mildred. Yellow Fever and the Board of Health. Memphis, Tennessee: Memphis and Shelby County Health Department, 1964.</ref> They stayed at the Peabody Hotel, the only hotel to keep its doors open during the epidemic (Crosby 60). From there they were assigned to their respective districts. Physicians of the epidemic reported seeing as many as 100 to 150 patients daily.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/>\n\nThe sisters of St. Mary's Hospital played an important role during the epidemic in caring for the lower classes. Already supporting a girls' school and church orphanage, the sisters of St. Mary's also sought to provide care for the Canfield Asylum, a home for black children. Each day, the sisters alternated caring for the orphans at St. Mary's, delivering children to the Canfield Asylum, and taking soup and medicine on house calls to patients.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> Between September 9 and October 4, Sister Constance and three other Sisters fell victim themselves to the epidemic and died. They later became known as \"The Martyrs of Memphis\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org |title=Welcomes You |publisher=The Episcopal Church |date= |accessdate=2017-07-13}}</ref>\n\nAt long last, on October 28, a killing frost struck. The city sent out word to Memphians scattered all over the country to come home. Though yellow fever cases were recorded in the pages of Elmwood Cemetery's burial record as late as February 29, 1874, the epidemic seemed quieted.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> The Board of Health declared the epidemic, which caused over 20,000 deaths and financial losses of nearly $200 million, at an end.<ref name=\"Ellis, John H 1992\">Ellis, John H. ''Yellow Fever & Public Health in the New South''. Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky, 1992.</ref> On November 27, a general citizen's meeting was called at the Greenlaw Opera House to offer thanks to those who had stayed behind to serve, of whom many died. Over the next year property tax revenues collapsed, and the city could not make payments on its municipal debts. As a result of this crisis, Memphis temporarily lost its city charter and was reclassified by the state legislature as a Taxing District from 1878\u20131893.<ref name=\"Hicks, Mildred 1964\"/> Although Memphis lost its charter and 75% of its population, a new era of sanitation was developed in the city. A new municipal government in 1879 helped form the first regional health organization and during the 1880s led the nation in sanitary reform and improvements.<ref name=\"Ellis, John H 1992\"/>\n\nPerhaps the most significant effect of the yellow fever on Memphis was in demographic changes. Nearly all of Memphis's upper and middle classes vanished, depriving the city of its general leadership and class structure that dictated everyday life, similar to other large Southern cities such as New Orleans, Charleston, and Atlanta. In Memphis, the poorer whites and blacks fundamentally made up the city and played the greatest role in rebuilding it. The epidemic had resulted in Memphis being a less cosmopolitan place, with an economy that served the cotton trade and a population drawn increasingly from poor white and black Southerners.<ref>Keith, Jeanette.

New York: Bloomsbury Press, 2012.</ref>\n\n===Late 19th century===\nThe 1890 election was strongly contested, resulting in opponents of the [[D. P. Hadden]] faction working to deprive them of votes by [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising blacks]]. The state had enacted several laws, including the requirement of [[poll taxes]], that served to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise]] many blacks. Although political party factions in the future sometimes paid [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] to enable blacks to vote, African Americans lost their last positions on the city council in this election and were forced out of the police force. (They did not recover the ability to exercise the franchise until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.) Historian L. B. Wrenn suggests the heightened political hostility of the Democratic contest and related social tensions contributed to a white mob [[Peoples Grocery|lynching three black grocers in Memphis in 1892]].<ref name=\"wrenn\">{{cite book |author = Wrenn, Lynette Boney |year = 1998 |page = given in superscript |title = Crisis and Commission Government in Memphis: Elite Rule in a Gilded Age City |location = Knoxville, Tennessee, USA |publisher = University of Tennessee Press |url = https://archive.org/details/crisiscommission0000wren |url-access = registration |access-date = December 2, 2015}}</ref>{{rp|124,131}}\n\nJournalist [[Ida B.

African-American residents drew from the civil rights movement to improve their lives. In 1968, the [[Memphis sanitation strike]] began for [[living wage]]s and better working conditions; the workers were overwhelmingly African American. They marched to gain public awareness and support for their plight: the danger of their work, and the struggles to support families with their low pay. Their drive for better pay had been met with resistance by the city government.\n\nRev.

A third interstate, [[Interstate 69 in Tennessee|I-69]], is under construction, and a fourth, [[Interstate 22|I-22]], has recently been designated from the former High Priority Corridor X. River [[barge]]s are unloaded onto trucks and trains.

The month-long series of events promotes Memphis's heritage and outreach of its people far beyond the city's borders. The four main events are the [[Beale Street Music Festival]], International Week, The World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest, and the Great River Run. The World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest is the largest pork [[barbecue]]-cooking contest in the world.\n\nIn April, downtown Memphis celebrates \"Africa in April Cultural Awareness Festival\", or simply Africa in April. The festival was designed to celebrate the arts, history, culture, and diversity of the [[African diaspora]]. Africa in April is a three-day festival with vendors' markets, fashion showcases, blues showcases, and an international diversity parade.<ref name=\"africainapril\">{{cite web |url=http://www.africainapril.org/ |title=Africa In April |publisher=Africa In April Cultural Awareness Festival, Inc. |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring late May-early June, Memphis is home to the [[Memphis Italian Festival]] at Marquette Park. The 2019 festival will be its 30th and has hosted musical acts, local artisans, and Italian cooking competitions. It also presents chef demonstrations, the Coors Light Competitive [[Bocce]] Tournament, the Galtelli Cup Recreational Bocce Tournament, a volleyball tournament, and pizza tossing demonstrations. This festival was started by Holy Rosary School and Parish and began inside the School parking lot in 1989. The Memphis Italian Festival is run almost completely by former and current Holy Rosary School and Church members and begins with a 5K run each year.\n\n[[Carnival Memphis]], formerly known as the Memphis Cotton Carnival, is an annual series of parties and festivities in June that salutes various aspects of Memphis and its industries. An annual King and Queen of Carnival are secretly selected to reign over Carnival activities. From 1935 to 1982, the African-American community staged the Cotton Makers Jubilee; it has merged with Carnival Memphis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memphismuseums.org/sub_exhibit-1537/ |title=Cotton Carnival |publisher=Memphismuseums.org |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nA market and arts festival, the Cooper-Young Festival,<ref>{{cite web|title=Cooper-Young Festival: How it Redefined Community|url=http://cooperyoung.weebly.com/cyfest-then--now.html|publisher=micromemphis.com  |accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref> is held annually in September in the [[Cooper-Young, Memphis|Cooper-Young]] district of [[Midtown Memphis]]. The event draws artists from all over North America and includes local music, art sales, contests, and displays.\n\nMemphis sponsors several film festivals: the [[Indie Memphis Film Festival]], Outflix, and the Memphis International Film and Music Festival. The Indie Memphis Film Festival is in its 14th year and was held April 27\u201328, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlocationmemphis.org/2013/14th-annual-on-location-memphis-international-film-announces-category-winners|title=14th Annual On Location: MEMPHIS International Film & Music Fest Wraps Up Its Weekend; Announces Category Winners |publisher=Onlocationmemphis.org |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> Recognized by ''MovieMaker Magazine'' as one of 25 \"Coolest Film Festivals\" (2009) and one of 25 \"Festivals Worth the Entry Fee\" (2011), Indie Memphis offers Memphis year-round independent film programming, including the Global Lens international film series, IM Student Shorts student films, and an outdoor concert film series at the historic [[Levitt Shell]]. The Outflix Film Festival, also in its 15th year, was held September 7\u201313, 2013. Outflix features a full week of [[LGBT]] cinema, including short films, features, and documentaries. The Memphis International Film and Music Festival is held in April; it is in its 11th year and takes place at Malco's Ridgeway Four.\n\nOn the weekend before Thanksgiving, the Memphis International Jazz Festival is held in the South Main Historic Arts District in Downtown Memphis. This festival promotes the important role Memphis has played in shaping Jazz nationally and internationally. Acts such as George Coleman, Herman Green, Kirk Whalum and Marvin Stamm all come out of the rich musical heritage in Memphis.\n\nFormerly titled the [[W. C. Handy]] Awards, the International Blues Awards are presented by the [[Blues Foundation]] (headquartered in Memphis) for [[Blues]] music achievement. Weeklong playing competitions are held, as well as an awards banquet including a night of performance and celebration.\n\n===Music===\nMemphis is the home of founders and pioneers of various American music genres, including [[Memphis soul]], [[Memphis blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rock n' roll]], [[Memphis rap]], Buck, [[crunk]], and \"sharecropper\" [[country music]] (in contrast to the \"[[rhinestone]]\" country sound of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]).\n\nMany musicians, including [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Shawn Lane]], [[Al Green]], [[Rance Allen]], [[Percy Sledge]], [[Solomon Burke]], [[William Bell (singer)|William Bell]], [[Sam & Dave]] and [[B.B. King]], got their start in Memphis in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n[[Beale Street]] is a national historical landmark, and shows the impact Memphis has had on American [[blues]], particularly after World War II as electric guitars took precedence. [[Sam Phillips]]' [[Sun Studio]], the most seminal recording studio in American popular music, still stands, and is open for tours. Elvis, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison all made their first recordings there, and were \"discovered\" by Phillips. Many great blues artists recorded there, such as [[W. C. Handy]], Father of the Blues.\n\n[[Stax Records]] created a classic 1960s [[soul music]] sound, much grittier and horn-based than [[Motown]]. Booker T. and the M.G.s were the label's backing band for most of the classic hits that came out of Stax, by Sam and Dave, [[Otis Redding]], [[Wilson Pickett]], and many more. The sound still lives on in the [[The Blues Brothers|''Blues Brothers'' movie]], in which many of the musicians starred as themselves.\n\nMemphis is noted for its influence on the [[power pop]] musical genre in the 1970s. Notable bands and musicians include [[Big Star]], [[Chris Bell (American musician)|Chris Bell]], [[Alex Chilton]], [[Tommy Hoehn]], [[The Scruffs]], and [[Prix]].<ref name=\"flyer\">{{cite news |first=J.D. |last=Reager |authorlink= |title=''Kill!

Metropolitan Opera performances are now broadcast in HD at local movie theaters across the country.\n\n===Visual art===\nIn addition to the [[Memphis Brooks Museum of Art|Brooks Museum]] and [[Dixon Gallery and Gardens]], Memphis plays host to two burgeoning visual art areas, one city-sanctioned, and the other organically formed.\n\nThe South Main Arts District is an arts neighborhood in south downtown. Over the past 20 years, the area has morphed from a derelict brothel and [[juke joint]] neighborhood to a [[gentrification|gentrified]], well-lit area sponsoring \"Trolley Night\", when arts patrons stroll down the street to see fire spinners, DJs playing in front of clubs, specialty shops and galleries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jacobson |first=Kelsey |url=http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/33410509/boutique-hotel-restaurant-slated-for-south-main |title=Boutique hotel, restaurant slated for South Main - WMC Action News 5 - Memphis, Tennessee |publisher=WMC Action News 5 |date= |accessdate=2017-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/exploring-our-town/south-main-artspace-lofts |title=South Main Artspace Lofts &#124; Exploring Our Town |website=Arts.gov |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2017-07-13}}</ref>\n\nAnother developing arts district in Memphis is Broad Avenue.

Novelist [[John Grisham]] grew up in nearby [[DeSoto County, Mississippi]], and sets many of his books in Memphis.\n\nMany works of fiction and literature are set in Memphis. These include ''[[The Reivers]]'' by [[William Faulkner]] (1962), ''September, September'' by Shelby Foote (1977); [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]]'s ''The Old Forest and Other Stories'' (1985), and his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[A Summons to Memphis]]'' (1986); ''[[The Firm (novel)|The Firm]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Client (novel)|The Client]]'' (1993), both by [[John Grisham]]; ''Memphis Afternoons: a Memoir'' by James Conaway (1993), ''Plague of Dreamers'' by Steve Stern (1997); ''[[Cassina Gambrel Was Missing]]'' by William Watkins (1999); ''The Guardian'' by Beecher Smith (1999), \"We are Billion-Year-Old Carbon\" by Corey Mesler (2005), ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], and ''The Architect'' by James Williamson (2007).\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Memphis, Tennessee}}\n\n====Points of interest====\n[[File:Peabody Hotel Memphis.jpg|thumb|[[Peabody Hotel]]]]\n* [[Beale Street]] - a significant location in the city's history, as well as in the history of the [[blues]].

In 1993, the [[Memphis Hound Dogs]] was a proposed NFL expansion that was passed over in favor of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] and [[Carolina Panthers]].

Following passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], civil rights activists challenged the at-large is electoral system in court because it made it more difficult for the minority to elect candidates of their choice; at-large voting favored candidates who could command a majority across the city. In 1995, the city adopted a new plan. The 13 Council positions are elected from nine geographic districts: seven are single-member districts and two elect three members each.\n\n[[Jim Strickland (politician)|Jim Strickland]] is the city's current mayor, elected on October 8, 2015. He is a former Memphis city councilman. The previous mayor of the city of Memphis was [[A C Wharton]].\n\nSince the late 20th century, regional discussions have recurred on the concept of consolidating unincorporated [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and Memphis into a [[metropolitan government]], as Nashville-Davidson County did in 1963. Consolidation was a referendum item on the 2010 ballots in both the city of Memphis and Shelby County, under the state law for dual-voting on such measures. The referendum was controversial in both jurisdictions. Black leaders, including then-Shelby County Commissioner [[Joe Ford (politician)|Joe Ford]] and national civil rights leader [[Al Sharpton]], opposed the consolidation. According to the plaintiffs' expert, Marcus Pohlmann, these leaders \"tried to turn that referendum into a civil rights issue, suggesting that for blacks to vote for consolidation was to give up hard-won civil rights victories of the past\".<ref name=\"consvote\"/>\n\nIn October 2010 before the vote, eight Shelby County citizens had filed a lawsuit in federal court against the state and the Shelby County Elections Commission against the dual-voting requirement. Plaintiffs argued that total votes for the referendum should have been counted together, rather than as separate elections. City voters narrowly supported the measure for consolidation with 50.8% in favor; county voters overwhelmingly voted against the measure with 85% against.<ref name=\"dismiss\">[http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/appellate-court-dismisses-challenge-of-dual-vote-requirement-for-consolidated-government_82638081 Clay Bailey, \"Appellate court dismisses challenge of dual vote requirement for consolidated government\"], ''Commercial Appeal'', December 31, 2014, accessed February 21, 2015</ref> The state argued that with the election decided, the lawsuit should be dismissed, but the federal court disagreed.<ref name=\"consvote\">[http://www.memphisdailynews.com/news/2014/jan/6/consolidation-voting-case-still-complex-in-3rd-year/ Bill Dries, \"Consolidation Voting Case Still Complex in 3rd Year\"], ''Memphis Daily News'', January 6, 2014, accessed February 21, 2015</ref>\n\nBy late 2013, in pre-trial actions, both sides were trying to disqualify the other's experts, in discussions of whether regional voting revealed racial polarization, and whether voting on the referendum demonstrated racial bloc voting. \"The experts for both sides have clashed on whether racial bloc voting is inevitable in local elections and whether that would require some kind of court remedy.\"<ref name=\"consvote\"/>\n\nThe defendants' expert, Todd Donovan, did not think that polarized voting as revealed for political candidates meant that \"African-American voters and white voters have polarized interests when it comes to referendum choices on government administration, taxation, service provision and other policy questions.\"<ref name=\"consvote\"/> He noted, \"In the absence of distinct political interests that create polarized blocs of referendum voters defined by race, there is no cohesive racial minority voting interest that can be diluted by a referendum.\"<ref name=\"consvote\"/>\n\nIn 2014, the federal district court dismissed the lawsuit, on the grounds that the referendum would have failed when both jurisdictions' votes were counted together. (In total voting, 64% of voters opposed the consolidation.) In the last week of December 2014, the U.S. Sixth District Court of Appeals upheld that decision, ruling that, \"\"In this election, the referendum for consolidation did not pass and would not have passed even if there had been no dual-majority vote requirement (with the vote counts combined).\"<ref name=\"dismiss\"/>\n\nBefore the referendum, the decision was made by the city and county to exclude public school management and operations from the proposed consolidation.

[[Interstate 69 in Tennessee|Interstate 69]] is a future interstate that, upon completion, will connect Memphis to Canada and Mexico.\n\nInterstate 40 is a coast-to-coast freeway that connects Memphis to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and on to [[North Carolina]] to the east, and [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], and the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] to the west.\n\nInterstate 55 connects Memphis to [[Saint Louis, Missouri]] and [[Chicago]] to the north, and [[Jackson, Mississippi]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to the south.\n\nInterstate 240 is the inner beltway which serves areas including Downtown, Midtown, South Memphis, [[Memphis International Airport]], East Memphis, and North Memphis.\n\nInterstate 269 is the nearly completed, larger, outer interstate loop immediately serving the suburbs of [[Millington, Tennessee|Millington]], Eads, [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], [[Collierville, Tennessee|Collierville]], and [[Hernando, Mississippi]].

Located in the low-lying delta region along the river, its outlying areas were developed as cotton plantations, and the city became a major cotton market and brokerage center.\n\nThe cotton economy of the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] South depended on the forced labor of large numbers of [[Slavery in the United States|African-American slaves]], and Memphis also developed as a major slave market for the domestic slave trade. Through the early 19th century, one million slaves were transported from the Upper South, in a huge forced migration to newly developed plantation areas in the Deep South. Many were transported by steamboats along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. In 1857, the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]] was completed, connecting the Atlantic Coast of South Carolina and this major Mississippi River port; it was the only east-west railroad constructed across the southern states prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. This gave planters and cotton brokers access to the Atlantic Coast for shipping cotton to England, a major market.\n\nThe city's demographics changed dramatically in the 1850s and 1860s under waves of immigration and domestic migration. Due to increased immigration since the 1840s and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], ethnic Irish made up 9.9 percent of the population in 1850, but 23.2 percent in 1860, when the total population was 22,623.<ref>Carriere, Marius.

They also gained many elected and patronage positions in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] city government, and an Irish man was elected as mayor before the Civil War. At that time, representatives were elected to the city council from 30 wards. The elite were worried about corruption in this system and that so many saloonkeepers were active in the wards. German immigrants also made this city a destination following the 1848 revolutions; both the Irish and German immigrants were mostly Catholic, adding another element to demographic change in this formerly Protestant city.\n\n[[File:Forrest Memphis Raid.jpg|thumb|Attack on [[Irving Block prison|Irving Block]] by General Forrest in 1864]]\n\n[[Tennessee#History|Tennessee]] seceded from the [[United States|Union]] in June 1861, and Memphis briefly became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] stronghold. [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Ironclad warship|ironclad gunboats]] captured the city in the naval [[Battle of Memphis]] on June 6, 1862, and the city and state were occupied by the [[Union Army]] for the duration of the war. The Union Army commanders allowed the city to maintain its civil government during most of this period but excluded Confederate veterans from office, which shifted political dynamics in the city as the war went on.<ref name=\"carden\">[http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/publication/WP1040_An%20Unrighteous%20Piece%20of%20Business.pdf Art Carden and Christopher J.

Meanwhile, Confederate General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] harassed Union forces in the area.\n\nThe war years contributed to additional dramatic changes in city population. The presence of the Union Army attracted many fugitive slaves who escaped from surrounding rural plantations. So many sought protection behind Union lines that the Army set up [[contraband]] camps to accommodate them. The black population of Memphis increased from 3,000 in 1860, when the total population was 22,623, to nearly 20,000 in 1865, with most settling south of what was then the city limits.<ref name=\"Ryan\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716953 Ryan, James G.

After race riots against the blacks in 1866, thousands left the city. The total population in 1870 was 40,220; the number of blacks had declined to 15,000 that year, or 37.4% of the total.(See census table in Demographics section.)\n\n===Postwar years, Reconstruction and Democratic control===\nThe rapid demographic changes, added to the stress of war and occupation, and uncertainty about who was in charge, resulted in growing tensions between the Irish policemen and black Union soldiers following the war.<ref name=\"carden\"/> In three days of rioting in early May 1866, the [[Memphis Riots of 1866|Memphis Riot]] erupted, in which white mobs made up of policemen, firemen, and other mostly ethnic [[Irish Americans]], attacked and killed 46 blacks, wounding 75 and injuring 100 persons; raped several women, and destroyed nearly 100 houses while severely damaging churches and schools in South Memphis. Much of the black settlement was left in ruins. Two whites were killed in the riot.<ref name=\"Ryan\"/> Many blacks permanently fled Memphis after the riot, especially as the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] continued to have difficulty in protecting them. Their population fell to about 15,000 by 1870,<ref name=\"carden\"/> or 37.4% of the city, which then had a total population of 40,226.(See census table in Demographics section.)\n\n[[File:Memphis airview 1870.jpg|thumb|Historic aerial view of Memphis, 1870]]\n\nHistorian Barrington Walker suggests that the Irish rioted against blacks because of their relatively recent arrival as immigrants and the uncertain nature of their own claim to \"whiteness\"; they were trying to separate themselves from blacks in the underclass. The main fighting participants were ethnic Irish, decommissioned black Union soldiers, and newly emancipated [[freedmen]] from the African-American community. Walker suggests that most of the mob were not in direct economic conflict with the blacks, as by then the Irish had attained better jobs, but the Irish were establishing dominance over the freedmen.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nIn Memphis, unlike disturbances in some other cities, ex-Confederate veterans were generally not part of the attacks against blacks. The outrages of the riot in Memphis and a similar one in New Orleans in September (the latter did include Confederate veterans) resulted in support in the North for Congress to pass the [[Reconstruction Act]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]].<ref name=\"Ryan\"/>\n\n===Yellow Jack===\nIn the 1870s, a series of [[yellow fever]] [[epidemic]]s devastated Memphis, with the disease being carried by river passengers along the waterways. During the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878, more than 5000 people were listed in the official register of deaths between July 26 and November 27. The vast majority died of yellow fever, making the epidemic in the city of 40,000 people one of the most traumatic and severe in urban United States' history. Within four days of the Memphis Board of Health's declaration of a yellow fever outbreak, 20,000 residents had fled the city. The panic ensuing left the poverty-stricken, the working classes, and the African-American community at most risk from the epidemic. Those who remained in Memphis relied on volunteers from religious and physician organizations to tend to the sick. By the end of the year, more than 5,000 were confirmed dead in Memphis. The New Orleans health board listed \"not less than 4,600\" dead. The Mississippi Valley recorded 120,000 cases of yellow fever, with 20,000 deaths. The $15 million in losses caused by the epidemic bankrupted the city of Memphis, and as a result its charter was revoked by the state legislature.\n\n[[File:AmCyc Memphis (Tennessee).jpg|thumb|Woodcut representing the waterfront of Memphis, c. 1879]]\nBy 1870, Memphis's population of 40,000 was almost double that of Nashville and Atlanta, and it ranked as the second-largest city in the South after New Orleans.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\">Crosby, Molly Caldwell. ''The American Plague: The Untold Story of Yellow Fever, the Epidemic That Shaped Our History''. New York: [[Berkley Books]], 2006.</ref> The population of Memphis continued to grow after 1870, even when the [[Panic of 1873]] hit the US hard, particularly in the South. The Panic of 1873 resulted in expanding Memphis's underclasses amidst the poverty and hardship wrought by the panic, giving further credence to Memphis as a rough, shiftless city. Leading up to the outbreak in 1878, it had suffered two yellow fever epidemics, cholera, and malaria, which gave Memphis a reputation as a sickly city and a filthy one. It was unheard of for a city with a population as large as that of Memphis not to have any waterworks; the city still relied for supplies entirely on collecting water from the river and rain cisterns, and it had no way to remove sewage.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> The combination of a swelling population, especially of lower and working classes, and the abysmal health and sanitary conditions of Memphis, made the city ripe for a serious epidemic.\n \nThe first case recorded for the public was when Mrs. Kate Bionda, an owner of an Italian \"snack house\", died of the fever on August 13.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> Hers was officially reported by the Board of Health, on August 14, as the first case of yellow fever in the city.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> A massive panic ensued. The same trains and steamboats that brought thousands into Memphis now in five days carried away over 25,000 Memphians, more than half of the population.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> On August 23, the Board of Health finally declared a yellow fever epidemic in Memphis, and the city collapsed, hemorrhaging its population. In July of that year, the city boasted a population of 47,000. By September, 19,000 remained and 17,000 of them had yellow fever.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> The only people left in the city were the lower classes, such as German and Irish immigrant workers, and African Americans. None had the means to flee the city, as did the middle and upper class whites of Memphis, and thus they were subjected to a city of death. \n \nImmediately following the Board of Health's declaration, a Citizen's Relief Committee was formed by Charles G. Fisher. It organized the city into refugee camps. The committee's main priority was separating the poor from the city and isolating them into refugee camps.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> Also, the Howard Association, formed specifically for yellow fever epidemics in New Orleans and Memphis, organized nurses and doctors within Memphis and throughout the country in response to the outbreak.<ref name=\"Hicks, Mildred 1964\">Hicks, Mildred.

Memphis, Tennessee: Memphis and Shelby County Health Department, 1964.</ref> They stayed at the Peabody Hotel, the only hotel to keep its doors open during the epidemic (Crosby 60). From there they were assigned to their respective districts. Physicians of the epidemic reported seeing as many as 100 to 150 patients daily.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/>\n\nThe sisters of St. Mary's Hospital played an important role during the epidemic in caring for the lower classes. Already supporting a girls' school and church orphanage, the sisters of St. Mary's also sought to provide care for the Canfield Asylum, a home for black children. Each day, the sisters alternated caring for the orphans at St. Mary's, delivering children to the Canfield Asylum, and taking soup and medicine on house calls to patients.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> Between September 9 and October 4, Sister Constance and three other Sisters fell victim themselves to the epidemic and died.

The city sent out word to Memphians scattered all over the country to come home. Though yellow fever cases were recorded in the pages of Elmwood Cemetery's burial record as late as February 29, 1874, the epidemic seemed quieted.<ref name=\"Crosby, Molly Caldwell 2006\"/> The Board of Health declared the epidemic, which caused over 20,000 deaths and financial losses of nearly $200 million, at an end.<ref name=\"Ellis, John H 1992\">Ellis, John H.

Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky, 1992.</ref> On November 27, a general citizen's meeting was called at the Greenlaw Opera House to offer thanks to those who had stayed behind to serve, of whom many died. Over the next year property tax revenues collapsed, and the city could not make payments on its municipal debts. As a result of this crisis, Memphis temporarily lost its city charter and was reclassified by the state legislature as a Taxing District from 1878\u20131893.<ref name=\"Hicks, Mildred 1964\"/> Although Memphis lost its charter and 75% of its population, a new era of sanitation was developed in the city. A new municipal government in 1879 helped form the first regional health organization and during the 1880s led the nation in sanitary reform and improvements.<ref name=\"Ellis, John H 1992\"/>\n\nPerhaps the most significant effect of the yellow fever on Memphis was in demographic changes. Nearly all of Memphis's upper and middle classes vanished, depriving the city of its general leadership and class structure that dictated everyday life, similar to other large Southern cities such as New Orleans, Charleston, and Atlanta. In Memphis, the poorer whites and blacks fundamentally made up the city and played the greatest role in rebuilding it. The epidemic had resulted in Memphis being a less cosmopolitan place, with an economy that served the cotton trade and a population drawn increasingly from poor white and black Southerners.<ref>Keith, Jeanette.

Hadden]] faction working to deprive them of votes by [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising blacks]]. The state had enacted several laws, including the requirement of [[poll taxes]], that served to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise]] many blacks. Although political party factions in the future sometimes paid [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] to enable blacks to vote, African Americans lost their last positions on the city council in this election and were forced out of the police force. (They did not recover the ability to exercise the franchise until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.) Historian L. B. Wrenn suggests the heightened political hostility of the Democratic contest and related social tensions contributed to a white mob [[Peoples Grocery|lynching three black grocers in Memphis in 1892]].<ref name=\"wrenn\">{{cite book |author = Wrenn, Lynette Boney |year = 1998 |page = given in superscript |title = Crisis and Commission Government in Memphis: Elite Rule in a Gilded Age City |location = Knoxville, Tennessee, USA |publisher = University of Tennessee Press |url = https://archive.org/details/crisiscommission0000wren |url-access = registration |access-date = December 2, 2015}}</ref>{{rp|124,131}}\n\nJournalist [[Ida B.

Pure water from an artesian well was discovered in the 1880s, securing the city's water supply. The commissioners developed an extensive network of parks and public works as part of the national [[City Beautiful movement]], but did not encourage heavy industry, which might have provided substantial employment for the working-class population.

African-American residents drew from the civil rights movement to improve their lives. In 1968, the [[Memphis sanitation strike]] began for [[living wage]]s and better working conditions; the workers were overwhelmingly African American. They marched to gain public awareness and support for their plight: the danger of their work, and the struggles to support families with their low pay. Their drive for better pay had been met with resistance by the city government.\n\nRev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], known for his leadership in the non-violent movement, came to lend his support to the workers' cause.

Located on the Mississippi River and intersected by five major freight railroads and two [[Interstate highways|Interstate Highways]], I-40 and I-55, Memphis is ideally located for commerce in the transportation and shipping industry. Its access by water was key to its initial development, with [[steamboats]] plying the Mississippi river. Railroad construction strengthened its connection to other markets to the east and west.\n\nSince the second half of the 20th century, highways and interstates have played major roles as transportation corridors. A third interstate, [[Interstate 69 in Tennessee|I-69]], is under construction, and a fourth, [[Interstate 22|I-22]], has recently been designated from the former High Priority Corridor X. River [[barge]]s are unloaded onto trucks and trains. The city is home to [[Memphis International Airport]], the world's second [[World's busiest airports by cargo traffic|busiest cargo airport]] (following Hong Kong). Memphis serves as a primary hub for [[FedEx Express]] shipping.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, Memphis was the home of three Fortune 500 companies: [[FedEx]] (no. 63), [[International Paper]] (no. 107), and [[AutoZone]] (no. 306).<ref>{{cite web|author=Hussung, Tricia |year=2014 |title=All About Tennessee's Fortune 500 Companies |url=http://online.king.edu/news/all-about-tennessees-fortune-500-companies/ |access-date=March 19, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319164012/http://online.king.edu/news/all-about-tennessees-fortune-500-companies/ |archivedate=March 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOther major corporations based in Memphis include [[Allenberg Cotton]], [[American Residential Services]] (also known as ARS/Rescue Rooter); [[Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz]]; [[Cargill Cotton]], [[City Gear]], [[First Horizon National Corporation]], [[Fred's]], [[GTx Incorporated|GTx]], [[Lenny's Sub Shop]], [[Mid-America Apartments]], [[Perkins Restaurant and Bakery]], [[ServiceMaster]], [[True Temper Sports]], [[Varsity Brands]], and [[Verso Paper]].

King]], got their start in Memphis in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n[[Beale Street]] is a national historical landmark, and shows the impact Memphis has had on American [[blues]], particularly after World War II as electric guitars took precedence. [[Sam Phillips]]' [[Sun Studio]], the most seminal recording studio in American popular music, still stands, and is open for tours. Elvis, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison all made their first recordings there, and were \"discovered\" by Phillips. Many great blues artists recorded there, such as [[W. C. Handy]], Father of the Blues.\n\n[[Stax Records]] created a classic 1960s [[soul music]] sound, much grittier and horn-based than [[Motown]]. Booker T. and the M.G.s were the label's backing band for most of the classic hits that came out of Stax, by Sam and Dave, [[Otis Redding]], [[Wilson Pickett]], and many more. The sound still lives on in the [[The Blues Brothers|''Blues Brothers'' movie]], in which many of the musicians starred as themselves.\n\nMemphis is noted for its influence on the [[power pop]] musical genre in the 1970s. Notable bands and musicians include [[Big Star]], [[Chris Bell (American musician)|Chris Bell]], [[Alex Chilton]], [[Tommy Hoehn]], [[The Scruffs]], and [[Prix]].<ref name=\"flyer\">{{cite news |first=J.D. |last=Reager |authorlink= |title=''Kill!

Following passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], civil rights activists challenged the at-large is electoral system in court because it made it more difficult for the minority to elect candidates of their choice; at-large voting favored candidates who could command a majority across the city. In 1995, the city adopted a new plan. The 13 Council positions are elected from nine geographic districts: seven are single-member districts and two elect three members each.\n\n[[Jim Strickland (politician)|Jim Strickland]] is the city's current mayor, elected on October 8, 2015. He is a former Memphis city councilman. The previous mayor of the city of Memphis was [[A C Wharton]].\n\nSince the late 20th century, regional discussions have recurred on the concept of consolidating unincorporated [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and Memphis into a [[metropolitan government]], as Nashville-Davidson County did in 1963. Consolidation was a referendum item on the 2010 ballots in both the city of Memphis and Shelby County, under the state law for dual-voting on such measures. The referendum was controversial in both jurisdictions. Black leaders, including then-Shelby County Commissioner [[Joe Ford (politician)|Joe Ford]] and national civil rights leader [[Al Sharpton]], opposed the consolidation. According to the plaintiffs' expert, Marcus Pohlmann, these leaders \"tried to turn that referendum into a civil rights issue, suggesting that for blacks to vote for consolidation was to give up hard-won civil rights victories of the past\".<ref name=\"consvote\"/>\n\nIn October 2010 before the vote, eight Shelby County citizens had filed a lawsuit in federal court against the state and the Shelby County Elections Commission against the dual-voting requirement. Plaintiffs argued that total votes for the referendum should have been counted together, rather than as separate elections. City voters narrowly supported the measure for consolidation with 50.8% in favor; county voters overwhelmingly voted against the measure with 85% against.<ref name=\"dismiss\">[http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/appellate-court-dismisses-challenge-of-dual-vote-requirement-for-consolidated-government_82638081 Clay Bailey, \"Appellate court dismisses challenge of dual vote requirement for consolidated government\"], ''Commercial Appeal'', December 31, 2014, accessed February 21, 2015</ref> The state argued that with the election decided, the lawsuit should be dismissed, but the federal court disagreed.<ref name=\"consvote\">[http://www.memphisdailynews.com/news/2014/jan/6/consolidation-voting-case-still-complex-in-3rd-year/ Bill Dries, \"Consolidation Voting Case Still Complex in 3rd Year\"], ''Memphis Daily News'', January 6, 2014, accessed February 21, 2015</ref>\n\nBy late 2013, in pre-trial actions, both sides were trying to disqualify the other's experts, in discussions of whether regional voting revealed racial polarization, and whether voting on the referendum demonstrated racial bloc voting. \"The experts for both sides have clashed on whether racial bloc voting is inevitable in local elections and whether that would require some kind of court remedy.\"<ref name=\"consvote\"/>\n\nThe defendants' expert, Todd Donovan, did not think that polarized voting as revealed for political candidates meant that \"African-American voters and white voters have polarized interests when it comes to referendum choices on government administration, taxation, service provision and other policy questions.\"<ref name=\"consvote\"/> He noted, \"In the absence of distinct political interests that create polarized blocs of referendum voters defined by race, there is no cohesive racial minority voting interest that can be diluted by a referendum.\"<ref name=\"consvote\"/>\n\nIn 2014, the federal district court dismissed the lawsuit, on the grounds that the referendum would have failed when both jurisdictions' votes were counted together. (In total voting, 64% of voters opposed the consolidation.) In the last week of December 2014, the U.S. Sixth District Court of Appeals upheld that decision, ruling that, \"\"In this election, the referendum for consolidation did not pass and would not have passed even if there had been no dual-majority vote requirement (with the vote counts combined).\"<ref name=\"dismiss\"/>\n\nBefore the referendum, the decision was made by the city and county to exclude public school management and operations from the proposed consolidation. As noted below, in 2011 the Memphis city council voted to dissolve its city school board and consolidate with the Shelby County School System, without the collaboration or agreement of Shelby County.<ref name=\"school\">[http://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/47_Anderson.pdf \"MAKING A  REGIONAL DISTRICT: MEMPHIS CITY SCHOOLS DISSOLVES INTO ITS SUBURBS\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221194549/http://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/47_Anderson.pdf |date=February 21, 2015 }}, ''Columbia Law Review'', March 2012</ref> The city had authority for this action under Tennessee state laws that differentiate between city and county powers.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Memphis, Tennessee}}\n[[File:Nurses.gif|thumb|Early nursing class in Memphis]]\nThe city is served by [[Shelby County Schools (Tennessee)|Shelby County Schools]].

Interstates 40 and 55 cross the Mississippi River at Memphis from the state of [[Arkansas]]. [[Interstate 69 in Tennessee|Interstate 69]] is a future interstate that, upon completion, will connect Memphis to Canada and Mexico.\n\nInterstate 40 is a coast-to-coast freeway that connects Memphis to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and on to [[North Carolina]] to the east, and [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], and the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] to the west.\n\nInterstate 55 connects Memphis to [[Saint Louis, Missouri]] and [[Chicago]] to the north, and [[Jackson, Mississippi]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to the south.\n\nInterstate 240 is the inner beltway which serves areas including Downtown, Midtown, South Memphis, [[Memphis International Airport]], East Memphis, and North Memphis.\n\nInterstate 269 is the nearly completed, larger, outer interstate loop immediately serving the suburbs of [[Millington, Tennessee|Millington]], Eads, [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], [[Collierville, Tennessee|Collierville]], and [[Hernando, Mississippi]].
