He has made a significant contribution towards imparting an exclusive Sri Lankan identity to the Sinhalese music. He was a musician, artist, poet and a photographer blended in to one. He also devoted more than 20 years of his life to uplifting musical standards in radio broadcasting.\n\n== Early life ==\nDunstan was born the eldest of nine children to businessman Abraham de Silva and Jane Kurukulasekara. In his childhood, he had cultivated a habit of visiting the [[Weligama]] beach and playing a flute he had crafted himself, to the melodies he heard over the gramophone at home. His father was not happy with this practice but his mother was more sympathetic.\n\nHe started his primary education at Sidhdhartha College [[Weligama]] in 1930 and moved to [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College Colombo]], a leading school in Sri Lanka for his secondary education in 1936. Dunstan successfully completed his Senior School Certificate in the English Medium from [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College]] offering English Language and Literature, Latin, Mathematics, Physics and Visual Arts. During this time he wrote poems to the school magazine and also contributed his visual arts to the school magazine. During this period he also learnt to play the violin from the renowned musician Don Vincent Peiris.\n\nAfter completing early studies at Nalanda College, Dunstan moved to [[Ananda College]] Colombo, another leading school in Sri Lanka and successfully completed the London matriculation examination in 1939.\n\nHis mother wanted her elder son Dunstan to be an Engineer. In order to fulfil his mother's aspirations Dunstan entered the [[Maradana College of Technology|Ceylon Technical College]] to pursue Engineering studies. Though he had chosen engineering studies to make his mother happy, his interest and passion was in music and arts. After successfully completing the Intermediate examination at the Ceylon Technical College, Dunstan quit engineering to pursue a career in music and arts.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    \n== Tertiary Education ==\nIn 1945, Dunstan received a government scholarship to study music at the prestigious [[Bhatkhande Music Institute]], in Lucknow, India. Distinguished scholar, Professor [[S N Ratanjankar]] was one of his teachers at the Bhatkhande Music Institute.\n\nDuring his term there, Dunstan participated in many music concerts produced by Bhatkhande Music Institute. He sang a Sinhalese song with his ''contemporary, a Bengali Student Bokul Dhaar in'' ''Malathi Maadhawa ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dad\u0dd3 \u0db8\u0dcf\u0daa\u0dc0 ; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0ba4\u0bc0 \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bb5 ; [[Hindi]]: \u092e\u093e\u0932\u0924\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0927\u0935'' )  concert produced by  Kalyan Pakar''. As'' published in the [[Lankadeepa|Lankaadeepa]] newspaper 1952 March 17 this was supposedly the first ever Sinhalese song sung in a concert in India. At this concert Dunstan and Bokul sang the song P''udamu meakusum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:''\u00a0''\u0db4\u0dd4\u0daf\u0db8\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca ; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc7 \u0b95\u0bc1\u0b9a\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd ; [[Hindi|Hindi:]] \u092a\u0941\u0926\u092e\u0941 \u092e\u0915\u0941\u0938\u0941\u092e'' ) composed by [[Ananda Samarakoon|Ananda Samarakoo]]<nowiki/>n.\n\nDunstan was one of the five best students selected by the Bhatkhande Music Institute to sing the [[Indian National Anthem]] at the first independence celebrations in India on the 15 August 1947. After successfully completing seven years of music studies Dunstan returned to Sri Lanka with a Sangeet Visharad degree. Since then he was known publicly as Visharad P Dunstan de Silva. He was the third Sri Lankan to obtain the music Visharad degree with the legendary musicians [[Lionel Edirisinghe]] and [[Sunil Shantha]] being the first two.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Teacher ===\nAfter giving up engineering studies, Dunstan joined his Alma mater\u00a0 Nalanda College as the resident Arts Teacher. The famous songwriter [[Karunaratne Abeysekera]] and [[Ridgeway Thilakeratne]] a one-time Director General of Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation were two of his students at [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College]].\n\n=== Photographer ===\nAfter completing his music studies in India he returned to Sri Lanka in 1951 and pursued his third passion, Photography. Dunstan opened a Colour Photo Studio under the name Studio Colour at No 453 [[Union Place]], Colombo 2 which was supposedly the first colour studio in Sri Lanka. Within two years he opened up another branch of Studio Colour at No 259/1, Colombo 4.\n\nPrime Minister [[Ranasinghe Premadasa|R Premadasa]] was a good friend of Dunstan. Because of this trust as a good friend and in recognition of his photography skills the Prime Minister Premadasa bestowed an honorary position on Dunstan as his personal photographer when he was the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka in the period January 1989 to May 1993. This was a prestigious position where Dunstan had to work in a high security environment having access to personal events in the Prime Minister's life.\n\nWhile being engaged in music, he continued simultaneously with his photography too. In 1978 he produced all colour photos for a 213-page publication titled, An Album of Buddhist Paintings published by the National Archives compiled by Professor [[Siri Gunasinghe]]. Dunstan provided photos of 40 Temple Wall Paintings for this publication covering the ancient sites of Gadaladeniya, Maulgampola, Hanguranketha, Degaldoru, Madawala, Kotagala and [[Dambulla cave temple|Dambulla Rock Temple]].\n\n=== Musician ===\nDustan grew up listening to gramophone music at home. His passion for music was conceived and evolved over the gramophone music he was exposed to at home as a child that took him through a music career placing him finally as the Head of Sinhalese Music Division at the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC).\n\nWhile engaging in his engineering studies at the Technical College, he followed two other passions that dearly touched his heart - Photography and Music. During this time an opportunity to play the flute for music programs in the [[Radio Ceylon]] came his way. He played the flute for the music programs of accomplished musicians [[Ananda Samarakoon]], Surya Shankar Molligoda and Anangalal Athukorala. The enticing lead accompaniment on the flute in Ananda Samarakoon's popular song of that vintage ''Punchi Suda Sudukatiya ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db4\u0dd4\u0d82\u0da0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dcf \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dd0\u0da7\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0b9e\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbe \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe; [[Hindi]]:\u092a\u0902\u091a \u0938\u0941\u0926\u093e \u0938\u0941\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u092f\u093e'' ) is credited to Dunstan de Silva.\n\nWhile being engaged in the photography business Dunstan continued to work on his prime passion of Music, which he studied at the [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhathkande Music Institute]]. In 1952 he composed music for the Opera Pushpa Shrungara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: ''\u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc2\u0dca\u0db4 \u0dc1\u0dd8\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dbb; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0baa \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb1 ; [[Hindi]]: \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0930\u093e'' ) directed by [[Shesha Palihakkara]] dancer, film actor, and producer. Dunstan made his debut as a music composer for Pushpa Shrungara.\n\nDuring a period of 21 years from 1954 to 1975 as the Head of Sinhalese Music at [[Radio Ceylon]] and [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] Dunstan produced many popular programs such as\n\n*''Rasadhara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] :\u0dbb\u0dc3\u0daa\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dcf; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb1\u0bbe ; [[Hindi]]:\u0930\u0938 \u0927\u0930\u093e )''\n*''Guwanviduli Geetha Nataka ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0d9c\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad \u0db1\u0dcf\u0da7\u0d9a; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0ba3\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bbf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4 \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0b95 ; [[Hindi]]: \u0917\u0941\u0935\u0928\u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0932\u0940 \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e \u0928\u093e\u091f\u0915  )''\n*''Vijaya Geetha ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0da2\u0dba \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0b9c\u0baf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4; [[Hindi]]: \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u093e \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e )''\n*''Raaga Rasa Vindhana ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0d9c \u0dbb\u0dc3 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0db1; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b95 \u00a0 \u0bb0\u0b9a \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba9;  [[Hindi]]: \u0930\u093e\u0917 \u0930\u0938 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0928\u093e )''\n*''Sath Piyum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0dad\u0dca\u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bcd\u00a0 \u0baa\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd ; [[Hindi]]: \u0938\u0920 \u092a\u093f\u092f\u0941\u092e )''\n\nIn addition to being the producer he also composed music for these.\n\n=== Artist ===\nDespite spending his professional life mostly in music, he continued to engage in art which he practised since the time that he was the art teacher at Nalanda College.

He was a regular poet featured in leading English newspapers of Sri Lanka. There remain more than 50 unpublished poems written by Dunstan to date. One of those is The Flute - which was the most sacred music Instrument to him which he excelled in since early childhood. He used the flute to create his music compositions.\n\nThe Flute is a beautiful poem Dunstan wrote about his beloved flute instrument which accompanied him from early life to the end of the life. He learnt music over the flute, his first job as a musician was to play the flute in [[Radio Ceylon]] orchestra and later he composed music using a flute.\n\n=== Visiting lecturer ===\n[[Lionel Edirisinghe]] Founder Principal of the Government Music College which later matured into the [[University of the Visual and Performing Arts]], offered a visiting lecturer position to Dunstan.\n\nWhen Dunstan became busy with his work at the Radio Ceylon producing music programs and working as a visiting lecture he didn't have enough time to spend on his photography business.\n\nThese dual engagements with the Radio Ceylon and the University competing for most of his time the simultaneous management of his photography business became untenable.\u00a0Consequently, he handed over his successful Studio Colour business to his brother Rohitha to continue.\n\n== Compositions ==\nFew of his compositions are;\n\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brQK2FuaX6A Obata mathaka naa\u00a0 \u0d94\u0db6\u0da7 \u0db8\u0dad\u0d9a \u0db1\u0dd1]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDx9_iVRLK8 Sudu piruwata andalaa \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0d87\u0db3\u0dbd\u0dcf]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKPJ9AdOjl0 Wanamal piyali salaa \u0dc0\u0db1\u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dbd\u0dcf]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMrZBJxxMQ Prakgna Pradeepa Dalwaa \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0da5\u0dcf \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0daf\u0dd3\u0db4 \u0daf\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dcf]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SjBOPmI510 Oba dakumen yali jeewath wannata \u0d94\u0db6 \u0daf\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0da2\u0dd3\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0da7]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5_trwNAFoA ''Pipunu malea ruwa''\u00a0 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dc5\u0dda \u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvD-hHSaY94 ''Kahawan goyamata'' \u0d9a\u0dc4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0dba\u0db8\u0da7]\n\n== Mentor ==\nDunstan was a mentor to many upcoming singers at his time in the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]]. When [[Sanath Nandasiri|Sanath Nanadasiri]] a stalwart of Sri Lankan music in later years returned to the country in 1965, conferred with a Visharad degree from the [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhatkande Music Institute]], Dunstan extended him an opportunity to participate with a debut rendition as a new artist for the Navadali Hena radio musical. Dunstan called upon Somathilaka Jayamaha another musician who reached the top rungs later who worked as an admin officer in [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to the free music classes he conducted at YMBA Colombo. When Somathilaka finished the course Dunstan recruited him to the choir in his programs. Over time Somathilaka was promoted as an A-Grade singer and reached the upper echelons as an accomplished singer. Devananda Waidyasekara was also another talent Dunstan picked and groomed at [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to turn into an accomplished singer.\n\n== Two Milestones ==\nThe year 1954 marked two important milestones in his life. One was in his personal life and the other was in his professional life. On 24 February 1954 he married Hilda Fonseka from [[Wadduwa]]. Dunstan had met Hilda when she came to see her music teacher during the time she was a student at Sri Sumangala Girls School, Panadura. Gunaseana de Silva who studied at [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhathkande Music institute]] with Dunstan proposed Hilda to Dunstan.\n\nOn 5 March 1955, Dunstan and Hilda were blessed with a precious daughter Ayanthi Manjula.\n\nIn the same year Dunstan got married, he received an invitation from the then Director General of the Radio Ceylon, [[M. J. Perera|M J Perera]], to join the Radio Ceylon. In 1954 Dunstan joined the Radio Ceylon as the Head of Sinhalese Music Programs.\n\nOn the 5th January 1967 Radio Ceylon was instituted as a public corporation as the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. He continued to serve as the head of Sinhalese Music Programs with the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\n== Service to Sinhalese Music ==\nDuring his 21 years of service in the national broadcasting corporation, he dedicated his time to uplifting musical standards and developing Sinhalese music to evolve towards a Sri Lankan identity, moving away from the dependence on foreign tunes. His good friend Pandit [[W. D. Amaradeva|W D Amaradeva]] contributed immensely to this endeavour with his own research efforts in this arena. \u00a0\n\nDunstan organised many classical music concerts inviting reputed singers and musicians from India affording Sri Lankan music lovers a chance to listen to them. He brought over his good friend legendary sitar player [[Ravi Shankar]] five times to Sri Lanka. [[Lakshmi Shankar]], Ustad [[Alla Rakha|Allarakha]] Qureshi, [[V. G. Jog|Vishnu Govind Jog]], Pandit Dinkar Kaikini <ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaikini|first=Dinkar|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/music-events/A-tribute-to-Pandit-Dinkar-Kaikini/articleshow/7309862.cms|title=ETIMES|date=18 April 2020|work=Entertainment Times|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and Dipali Nag were other accomplished musicians he brought from India. \n[[File:Dunstan--Edit.jpg|thumb|L to R- Dunstan, his daughter and wife, Ravi Shankar, Laxmie Shankar and Ustad Allarakha Qureshi]]\nNone of those concerts were for commercial benefit. He organised those only to provide an opportunity for the Sri Lankan music lovers to listen to the music of those legends. There were times that he had to pocket out shortfalls in organising these concerts.\n\nDunstan was the founding secretary of the music subcommittee of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka which was a branch of the then [[Ministry of Higher Education and Highways|Ministry of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs]]. In 1959 he was appointed the President of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1964 he represented Sri Lanka in the International Classical Music conference in Germany. \n[[File:Dunstan 4 lihgtroom.jpg|center|thumb|Dunstan representing Sri Lanka in International Classical Music Conference in Germany in 1964]]\n\n=== Head of Music at the Ministry of Education ===\nIn 1975 Dunstan left the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC) to take up an appointment as the Head of Music at the [[Ministry of Education (Sri Lanka)|Ministry Of Education (Sri Lanka)]]. His main task was to improve standards and develop the Music Syllabus for the schools and higher education institutes in Sri Lanka.\n\n== End of Career ==\nAfter two years of service at the Ministry of Education, he was called upon to the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] to take up office as the head of the Sinhalese Music Division. He served in this position till he retired in 1983.\n\nIn appreciation of the services he rendered to Sri Lankan Music, the Tower Hall Foundation honoured him by bestowing him with the most coveted Kalamanya award.\n\nOn the 16th November 1986, Dunstan received the Kalamanya award from the President of Sri Lanka, Hon [[J. R. Jayewardene|J.R Jayawardene]] and the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka [[Ranasinghe Premadasa|R. Premadasa]].\n\nIn 1986 the National Television, [[Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation|Sri Lanka Rupavahini]] produced a two-year program called Pada Saraniiya\u00a0([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db4\u0daf \u0dc3\u0dbb\u0dab\u0dd2\u0dba; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0ba4 \u0b9a\u0bb0\u0ba3\u0bbf\u0baf; [[Hindi]]: \u092a\u093e\u0927\u093e \u0938\u0930\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e ) comprising of music composed by Dunstan de Silva. His last music composition, Sithum Pathum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0baa\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd; [[Hindi]]: \u0938\u0940\u0925\u0941\u092e \u092a\u0925\u0941\u092e) sung by Deepika Priyadharshini was featured in this program.\n\nThis was his swansong.\n\nOn the 28 October 1988 Dunstan passed away due to a medical misadventure.\n\nThe name Dunstan de Siva, great musician, poet, artist and photographer will remain etched in the memories of the art loving public of Sri Lanka forever.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Uncategorized|date=April 2020}}\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ariyaratne|first=Sunil|date=2013|title=Gandharva Apadana; No.04|url=http://opac.lib.sjp.ac.lk/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=111315&query_desc=se%2Cphr%3A%22Gandharva%20Apadana|journal=Gandharva Apadana; No.04|volume=|pages=83\u2013154|via=University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka}}</ref><br />{{Infobox person\n| name         = Dunstan de Silva\n| image        = Dunstan lihgtroom.jpg\n| caption      = \n| birth_name   = Patabandige Dunstan de Silva\n| birth_date   = {{birth-date|21 April 1921}}\n| birth_place  = [[Ambalangoda, Sri Lanka]]\n| death_date   = {{death-date and age|28 October 1988|21 April 1921}}\n| death_place  = [[Nugegoda, Sri Lanka]]\n| alma_mater   = [[Bhatkhande Music Institute]], India - [[Ananda College]] Colombo - [[Nalanda College Colombo]]- Sidhdhartha College, Weligama, Sri Lanka\n| occupation   = Musician- Composer - Radio Music Program Director \u2013 Radio Broadcasting Music Standards Developer - University Lecturer - Arts Teacher - Photographer\n| years_active = 1954-1988\n| employer     = [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]]\n| known_for    = \n}}\n'''Dunstan de Silva''' was a Sri Lankan musician and a composer of Sinhalese music adorned with the title Visharad. He has made a significant contribution towards imparting an exclusive Sri Lankan identity to the Sinhalese music. He was a musician, artist, poet and a photographer blended in to one. He also devoted more than 20 years of his life to uplifting musical standards in radio broadcasting.\n\n== Early life ==\nDunstan was born the eldest of nine children to businessman Abraham de Silva and Jane Kurukulasekara. In his childhood, he had cultivated a habit of visiting the [[Weligama]] beach and playing a flute he had crafted himself, to the melodies he heard over the gramophone at home. His father was not happy with this practice but his mother was more sympathetic.\n\nHe started his primary education at Sidhdhartha College [[Weligama]] in 1930 and moved to [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College Colombo]], a leading school in Sri Lanka for his secondary education in 1936. Dunstan successfully completed his Senior School Certificate in the English Medium from [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College]] offering English Language and Literature, Latin, Mathematics, Physics and Visual Arts. During this time he wrote poems to the school magazine and also contributed his visual arts to the school magazine. During this period he also learnt to play the violin from the renowned musician Don Vincent Peiris.\n\nAfter completing early studies at Nalanda College, Dunstan moved to [[Ananda College]] Colombo, another leading school in Sri Lanka and successfully completed the London matriculation examination in 1939.\n\nHis mother wanted her elder son Dunstan to be an Engineer. In order to fulfil his mother's aspirations Dunstan entered the [[Maradana College of Technology|Ceylon Technical College]] to pursue Engineering studies. Though he had chosen engineering studies to make his mother happy, his interest and passion was in music and arts. After successfully completing the Intermediate examination at the Ceylon Technical College, Dunstan quit engineering to pursue a career in music and arts.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    \n== Tertiary Education ==\nIn 1945, Dunstan received a government scholarship to study music at the prestigious [[Bhatkhande Music Institute]], in Lucknow, India. Distinguished scholar, Professor [[S N Ratanjankar]] was one of his teachers at the Bhatkhande Music Institute.\n\nDuring his term there, Dunstan participated in many music concerts produced by Bhatkhande Music Institute. He sang a Sinhalese song with his ''contemporary, a Bengali Student Bokul Dhaar in'' ''Malathi Maadhawa ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dad\u0dd3 \u0db8\u0dcf\u0daa\u0dc0 ; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0ba4\u0bc0 \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bb5 ; [[Hindi]]: \u092e\u093e\u0932\u0924\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0927\u0935'' )  concert produced by  Kalyan Pakar''. As'' published in the [[Lankadeepa|Lankaadeepa]] newspaper 1952 March 17 this was supposedly the first ever Sinhalese song sung in a concert in India. At this concert Dunstan and Bokul sang the song P''udamu meakusum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:''\u00a0''\u0db4\u0dd4\u0daf\u0db8\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca ; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc7 \u0b95\u0bc1\u0b9a\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd ; [[Hindi|Hindi:]] \u092a\u0941\u0926\u092e\u0941 \u092e\u0915\u0941\u0938\u0941\u092e'' ) composed by [[Ananda Samarakoon|Ananda Samarakoo]]<nowiki/>n.\n\nDunstan was one of the five best students selected by the Bhatkhande Music Institute to sing the [[Indian National Anthem]] at the first independence celebrations in India on the 15 August 1947. After successfully completing seven years of music studies Dunstan returned to Sri Lanka with a Sangeet Visharad degree. Since then he was known publicly as Visharad P Dunstan de Silva. He was the third Sri Lankan to obtain the music Visharad degree with the legendary musicians [[Lionel Edirisinghe]] and [[Sunil Shantha]] being the first two.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Teacher ===\nAfter giving up engineering studies, Dunstan joined his Alma mater\u00a0 Nalanda College as the resident Arts Teacher. The famous songwriter [[Karunaratne Abeysekera]] and [[Ridgeway Thilakeratne]] a one-time Director General of Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation were two of his students at [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College]].\n\n=== Photographer ===\nAfter completing his music studies in India he returned to Sri Lanka in 1951 and pursued his third passion, Photography. Dunstan opened a Colour Photo Studio under the name Studio Colour at No 453 [[Union Place]], Colombo 2 which was supposedly the first colour studio in Sri Lanka. Within two years he opened up another branch of Studio Colour at No 259/1, Colombo 4.\n\nPrime Minister [[Ranasinghe Premadasa|R Premadasa]] was a good friend of Dunstan. Because of this trust as a good friend and in recognition of his photography skills the Prime Minister Premadasa bestowed an honorary position on Dunstan as his personal photographer when he was the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka in the period January 1989 to May 1993. This was a prestigious position where Dunstan had to work in a high security environment having access to personal events in the Prime Minister's life.\n\nWhile being engaged in music, he continued simultaneously with his photography too. In 1978 he produced all colour photos for a 213-page publication titled, An Album of Buddhist Paintings published by the National Archives compiled by Professor [[Siri Gunasinghe]]. Dunstan provided photos of 40 Temple Wall Paintings for this publication covering the ancient sites of Gadaladeniya, Maulgampola, Hanguranketha, Degaldoru, Madawala, Kotagala and [[Dambulla cave temple|Dambulla Rock Temple]].\n\n=== Musician ===\nDustan grew up listening to gramophone music at home. His passion for music was conceived and evolved over the gramophone music he was exposed to at home as a child that took him through a music career placing him finally as the Head of Sinhalese Music Division at the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC).\n\nWhile engaging in his engineering studies at the Technical College, he followed two other passions that dearly touched his heart - Photography and Music. During this time an opportunity to play the flute for music programs in the [[Radio Ceylon]] came his way. He played the flute for the music programs of accomplished musicians [[Ananda Samarakoon]], Surya Shankar Molligoda and Anangalal Athukorala.

In 1952 he composed music for the Opera Pushpa Shrungara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: ''\u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc2\u0dca\u0db4 \u0dc1\u0dd8\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dbb; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0baa \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb1 ; [[Hindi]]: \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0930\u093e'' ) directed by [[Shesha Palihakkara]] dancer, film actor, and producer. Dunstan made his debut as a music composer for Pushpa Shrungara.\n\nDuring a period of 21 years from 1954 to 1975 as the Head of Sinhalese Music at [[Radio Ceylon]] and [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] Dunstan produced many popular programs such as\n\n*''Rasadhara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] :\u0dbb\u0dc3\u0daa\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dcf; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb1\u0bbe ; [[Hindi]]:\u0930\u0938 \u0927\u0930\u093e )''\n*''Guwanviduli Geetha Nataka ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0d9c\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad \u0db1\u0dcf\u0da7\u0d9a; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0ba3\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bbf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4 \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0b95 ; [[Hindi]]: \u0917\u0941\u0935\u0928\u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0932\u0940 \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e \u0928\u093e\u091f\u0915  )''\n*''Vijaya Geetha ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0da2\u0dba \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0b9c\u0baf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4; [[Hindi]]: \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u093e \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e )''\n*''Raaga Rasa Vindhana ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0d9c \u0dbb\u0dc3 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0db1; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b95 \u00a0 \u0bb0\u0b9a \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba9;  [[Hindi]]: \u0930\u093e\u0917 \u0930\u0938 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0928\u093e )''\n*''Sath Piyum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0dad\u0dca\u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bcd\u00a0 \u0baa\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd ; [[Hindi]]: \u0938\u0920 \u092a\u093f\u092f\u0941\u092e )''\n\nIn addition to being the producer he also composed music for these.\n\n=== Artist ===\nDespite spending his professional life mostly in music, he continued to engage in art which he practised since the time that he was the art teacher at Nalanda College. Dunstan designed the cover page of the significant publication called Sangeetha Sanhithaa<ref>{{Cite book|last=Abayasundara|first=Wimal|title=Sangeetha Sanhitha|publisher=S Godage Saha Sahodarayo|year=|isbn=9552055008|location=|pages=}}</ref> written by Eminent Sinhala poet and lyricist and Kalakeerthi Pundit Wimal Abeysundara.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Abeysundara|first=Wimal|url=http://www.island.lk/2008/06/13/news19.html|title=Wimal Abeysundara no more|date=|work=The Island|access-date=17 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Poet ===\n[[File:Young Dunstan as a Flautist in Radio Ceylon.jpg|thumb|Young Dunstan as a Flautist in Radio Ceylon Orchestra]]\nDunstan continued to write poems another-pastime that he had developed during his school years. He was a regular poet featured in leading English newspapers of Sri Lanka. There remain more than 50 unpublished poems written by Dunstan to date. One of those is The Flute - which was the most sacred music Instrument to him which he excelled in since early childhood. He used the flute to create his music compositions.\n\nThe Flute is a beautiful poem Dunstan wrote about his beloved flute instrument which accompanied him from early life to the end of the life. He learnt music over the flute, his first job as a musician was to play the flute in [[Radio Ceylon]] orchestra and later he composed music using a flute.\n\n=== Visiting lecturer ===\n[[Lionel Edirisinghe]] Founder Principal of the Government Music College which later matured into the [[University of the Visual and Performing Arts]], offered a visiting lecturer position to Dunstan.\n\nWhen Dunstan became busy with his work at the Radio Ceylon producing music programs and working as a visiting lecture he didn't have enough time to spend on his photography business.\n\nThese dual engagements with the Radio Ceylon and the University competing for most of his time the simultaneous management of his photography business became untenable.\u00a0Consequently, he handed over his successful Studio Colour business to his brother Rohitha to continue.\n\n== Compositions ==\nFew of his compositions are;\n\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brQK2FuaX6A Obata mathaka naa\u00a0 \u0d94\u0db6\u0da7 \u0db8\u0dad\u0d9a \u0db1\u0dd1]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDx9_iVRLK8 Sudu piruwata andalaa \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0d87\u0db3\u0dbd\u0dcf]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKPJ9AdOjl0 Wanamal piyali salaa \u0dc0\u0db1\u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dbd\u0dcf]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoMrZBJxxMQ Prakgna Pradeepa Dalwaa \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0da5\u0dcf \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0daf\u0dd3\u0db4 \u0daf\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dcf]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SjBOPmI510 Oba dakumen yali jeewath wannata \u0d94\u0db6 \u0daf\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0da2\u0dd3\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0da7]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5_trwNAFoA ''Pipunu malea ruwa''\u00a0 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dc5\u0dda \u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvD-hHSaY94 ''Kahawan goyamata'' \u0d9a\u0dc4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0dba\u0db8\u0da7]\n\n== Mentor ==\nDunstan was a mentor to many upcoming singers at his time in the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]]. When [[Sanath Nandasiri|Sanath Nanadasiri]] a stalwart of Sri Lankan music in later years returned to the country in 1965, conferred with a Visharad degree from the [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhatkande Music Institute]], Dunstan extended him an opportunity to participate with a debut rendition as a new artist for the Navadali Hena radio musical. Dunstan called upon Somathilaka Jayamaha another musician who reached the top rungs later who worked as an admin officer in [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to the free music classes he conducted at YMBA Colombo. When Somathilaka finished the course Dunstan recruited him to the choir in his programs. Over time Somathilaka was promoted as an A-Grade singer and reached the upper echelons as an accomplished singer. Devananda Waidyasekara was also another talent Dunstan picked and groomed at [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to turn into an accomplished singer.\n\n== Two Milestones ==\nThe year 1954 marked two important milestones in his life. One was in his personal life and the other was in his professional life. On 24 February 1954 he married Hilda Fonseka from [[Wadduwa]]. Dunstan had met Hilda when she came to see her music teacher during the time she was a student at Sri Sumangala Girls School, Panadura. Gunaseana de Silva who studied at [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhathkande Music institute]] with Dunstan proposed Hilda to Dunstan.\n\nOn 5 March 1955, Dunstan and Hilda were blessed with a precious daughter Ayanthi Manjula.\n\nIn the same year Dunstan got married, he received an invitation from the then Director General of the Radio Ceylon, [[M. J. Perera|M J Perera]], to join the Radio Ceylon. In 1954 Dunstan joined the Radio Ceylon as the Head of Sinhalese Music Programs.\n\nOn the 5th January 1967 Radio Ceylon was instituted as a public corporation as the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. He continued to serve as the head of Sinhalese Music Programs with the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\n== Service to Sinhalese Music ==\nDuring his 21 years of service in the national broadcasting corporation, he dedicated his time to uplifting musical standards and developing Sinhalese music to evolve towards a Sri Lankan identity, moving away from the dependence on foreign tunes. His good friend Pandit [[W. D. Amaradeva|W D Amaradeva]] contributed immensely to this endeavour with his own research efforts in this arena. \u00a0\n\nDunstan organised many classical music concerts inviting reputed singers and musicians from India affording Sri Lankan music lovers a chance to listen to them. He brought over his good friend legendary sitar player [[Ravi Shankar]] five times to Sri Lanka. [[Lakshmi Shankar]], Ustad [[Alla Rakha|Allarakha]] Qureshi, [[V. G. Jog|Vishnu Govind Jog]], Pandit Dinkar Kaikini <ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaikini|first=Dinkar|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/music-events/A-tribute-to-Pandit-Dinkar-Kaikini/articleshow/7309862.cms|title=ETIMES|date=18 April 2020|work=Entertainment Times|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and Dipali Nag were other accomplished musicians he brought from India. \n[[File:Dunstan--Edit.jpg|thumb|L to R- Dunstan, his daughter and wife, Ravi Shankar, Laxmie Shankar and Ustad Allarakha Qureshi]]\nNone of those concerts were for commercial benefit. He organised those only to provide an opportunity for the Sri Lankan music lovers to listen to the music of those legends. There were times that he had to pocket out shortfalls in organising these concerts.\n\nDunstan was the founding secretary of the music subcommittee of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka which was a branch of the then [[Ministry of Higher Education and Highways|Ministry of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs]]. In 1959 he was appointed the President of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1964 he represented Sri Lanka in the International Classical Music conference in Germany. \n[[File:Dunstan 4 lihgtroom.jpg|center|thumb|Dunstan representing Sri Lanka in International Classical Music Conference in Germany in 1964]]\n\n=== Head of Music at the Ministry of Education ===\nIn 1975 Dunstan left the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC) to take up an appointment as the Head of Music at the [[Ministry of Education (Sri Lanka)|Ministry Of Education (Sri Lanka)]]. His main task was to improve standards and develop the Music Syllabus for the schools and higher education institutes in Sri Lanka.\n\n== End of Career ==\nAfter two years of service at the Ministry of Education, he was called upon to the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] to take up office as the head of the Sinhalese Music Division. He served in this position till he retired in 1983.\n\nIn appreciation of the services he rendered to Sri Lankan Music, the Tower Hall Foundation honoured him by bestowing him with the most coveted Kalamanya award.\n\nOn the 16th November 1986, Dunstan received the Kalamanya award from the President of Sri Lanka, Hon [[J. R. Jayewardene|J.R Jayawardene]] and the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka [[Ranasinghe Premadasa|R. Premadasa]].\n\nIn 1986 the National Television, [[Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation|Sri Lanka Rupavahini]] produced a two-year program called Pada Saraniiya\u00a0([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db4\u0daf \u0dc3\u0dbb\u0dab\u0dd2\u0dba; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0ba4 \u0b9a\u0bb0\u0ba3\u0bbf\u0baf; [[Hindi]]: \u092a\u093e\u0927\u093e \u0938\u0930\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e ) comprising of music composed by Dunstan de Silva. His last music composition, Sithum Pathum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0baa\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd; [[Hindi]]: \u0938\u0940\u0925\u0941\u092e \u092a\u0925\u0941\u092e) sung by Deepika Priyadharshini was featured in this program.\n\nThis was his swansong.\n\nOn the 28 October 1988 Dunstan passed away due to a medical medical misadventure.\n\nThe name Dunstan de Siva, great musician, poet, artist and photographer will remain etched in the memories of the art loving public of Sri Lanka forever.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Uncategorized|date=April 2020}}\n", "name_user": "HarinMusic", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunstan_de_Silva"}

Meant as an alternative to the [[condom]] for males, it was invented by Danish [[Medical Doctor|MD]] [[Lasse Hessel]] and is worn internally by the female partner to prevent exposure to ejaculated [[semen]] or other body fluids.

They typically come in various sizes. For most vaginas, a moderately sized condom is adequate; women who have recently given birth should try a large size first. The inner ring or foam disc at the closed end of the sheath is used to insert the condom inside the vagina and to hold it in place during intercourse. The rolled outer ring or poly frame at the open end of the sheath remains outside the vagina and covers part of the external genitalia.\n\nThe female condom was developed in the late 20th century (male condoms have been used for centuries). A primary motive for its creation is the well-documented refusal of some men to use a condom because of loss of sensation and the resulting impact on the hardness of the man's [[erection]], and secondarily by its implication that the male could transmit an STI.<ref>National Health Service (United Kingdom), \"What if my partner won't use condoms?\", July 16, 2014, http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/partner-wont-use-condoms.aspx, retrieved February 8, 2017.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geter |first1=Angelica |last2=Crosby |first2=Richard |title=Condom Refusal and Young Black Men: the Influence of Pleasure, Sexual Partners, and Friends |journal=Journal of Urban Health |date=2014 |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=541\u2013546 |doi=10.1007/s11524-014-9869-4 |pmid=24777393 |pmc=4074317 }}</ref>\n\n==Versions and materials==\n[[file:Female Condom.png|thumb|left|200px|An illustration of a female condom]]\n[[Image:ReddyFc.png|thumb|left|VA wow brand female condom]]\nThe FC1 female condom was first made from [[polyurethane]].

The newer nitrile condoms are less likely to make potentially distracting crinkling noises.

At each end there is a flexible ring. At the closed end of the sheath, the flexible ring is inserted into the vagina to hold the female condom in place. The other end of the sheath stays outside the [[vulva]] at the entrance to the vagina. This ring acts as a guide during penetration and stops the sheath from shifting during intercourse. There is a silicone-based lubricant on the inside of the condom, but additional lubrication can be used. The condom does not contain spermicide.\n\n===VA W.o.W.===\nThe VA w.o.w.\u00ae Condom Feminine is manufactured by HLL Lifecare Ltd and IXu LLC.

The Woman's Condom is a polyurethane pouch that is partially enclosed in a capsule to aid insertion. The capsule dissolves quickly after insertion in the vagina, which releases the pouch. The condom is then held stable in the woman by foam pads. The Woman's Condom is packaged dry and comes with a small sachet of water-based lubricant to be applied at point of use. PATH licensed manufacturing and distribution of the Woman's Condom to the Shanghai Dahua Medical Apparatus Company in 2008. Dahua has received the South Africa Bureau of Standards (SABS) certification marking (2013), Shanghai Food and Drug Administration Approval (2011), and the CE Mark approval (2010) for the Woman's Condom, which allows for marketing and distribution of the product in South Africa, China and Europe, respectively. The Woman's Condom is currently under review by the WHO/United Nations Population Fund Technical Review Committee; the Committee's approval could lead to bulk public-sector purchase by United Nations agencies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://preventionnow.net/female_condoms/products/ |title=The Woman's Condom |publisher=PreventionNow.net |access-date=2010-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419024500/http://www.preventionnow.net/female_condoms/products/ |archive-date=2010-04-19 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Natural Sensation Female Condom===\nThe Natural Sensation Panty Condom is distributed in the US exclusively by the ACME Condom Company.

Female condoms cost, on average, US$2\u20134, depending on local market factors. At the 2012 Family Planning Summit in London, the Female Health Company pledged to increase access to the FC2\u00ae female condom for the world's poorest countries and announced a prospective pricing arrangement based on aggregate purchases and 5 percent free goods based on the prior year's purchases, together with a multiyear agreement to provide $14 million in training and education by FHC over the next six years.\n\nThe Cupid\u2122 female condoms have been sold in Kyrgyz Republic through UNFPA for their public distribution system.

They typically come in various sizes. For most vaginas, a moderately sized condom is adequate; women who have recently given birth should try a large size first. The inner ring or foam disc at the closed end of the sheath is used to insert the condom inside the vagina and to hold it in place during intercourse. The rolled outer ring or poly frame at the open end of the sheath remains outside the vagina and covers part of the external genitalia.\n\nThe female condom was developed in the late 20th century (male condoms have been used for centuries). A primary motive for its creation is the well-documented refusal of some men to use a condom because of loss of sensation and the resulting impact on the hardness of the man's [[erection]], and secondarily by its implication that the male could transmit an STI.<ref>National Health Service (United Kingdom), \"What if my partner won't use condoms?\", July 16, 2014, http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/partner-wont-use-condoms.aspx, retrieved February 8, 2017.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geter |first1=Angelica |last2=Crosby |first2=Richard |title=Condom Refusal and Young Black Men: the Influence of Pleasure, Sexual Partners, and Friends |journal=Journal of Urban Health |date=2014 |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=541\u2013546 |doi=10.1007/s11524-014-9869-4 |pmid=24777393 |pmc=4074317 }}</ref>\n\n==Versions and materials==\n[[file:Female Condom.png|thumb|left|200px|An illustration of a female condom]]\n[[Image:ReddyFc.png|thumb|left|VA wow brand female condom]]\nThe FC1 female condom was first made from [[polyurethane]].

At each end there is a flexible ring. At the closed end of the sheath, the flexible ring is inserted into the vagina to hold the female condom in place. The other end of the sheath stays outside the [[vulva]] at the entrance to the vagina. This ring acts as a guide during penetration and stops the sheath from shifting during intercourse. There is a silicone-based lubricant on the inside of the condom, but additional lubrication can be used. The condom does not contain spermicide.\n\n===VA W.o.W.===\nThe VA w.o.w.\u00ae Condom Feminine is manufactured by HLL Lifecare Ltd and IXu LLC.

The Woman's Condom is a polyurethane pouch that is partially enclosed in a capsule to aid insertion. The capsule dissolves quickly after insertion in the vagina, which releases the pouch. The condom is then held stable in the woman by foam pads. The Woman's Condom is packaged dry and comes with a small sachet of water-based lubricant to be applied at point of use. PATH licensed manufacturing and distribution of the Woman's Condom to the Shanghai Dahua Medical Apparatus Company in 2008. Dahua has received the South Africa Bureau of Standards (SABS) certification marking (2013), Shanghai Food and Drug Administration Approval (2011), and the CE Mark approval (2010) for the Woman's Condom, which allows for marketing and distribution of the product in South Africa, China and Europe, respectively.

Female condoms cost, on average, US$2\u20134, depending on local market factors. At the 2012 Family Planning Summit in London, the Female Health Company pledged to increase access to the FC2\u00ae female condom for the world's poorest countries and announced a prospective pricing arrangement based on aggregate purchases and 5 percent free goods based on the prior year's purchases, together with a multiyear agreement to provide $14 million in training and education by FHC over the next six years.\n\nThe Cupid\u2122 female condoms have been sold in Kyrgyz Republic through UNFPA for their public distribution system.

It was released by [[Epic Records]] on November 26, 1991. Jackson, [[Bill Bottrell]], [[Teddy Riley]], and [[Bruce Swedien]] co-produced the album. This was Jackson's first album since ''[[Forever, Michael]]'' (1975) not produced by longtime collaborator [[Quincy Jones]]. Featured artists include [[Heavy D]], [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Wreckx-n-Effect]]. The music incorporates [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[new jack swing]], a new genre in vogue at the time. Elements of [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Rock music|rock]] can also be found. Twelve of the album's fourteen songs were written or co-written by Jackson, discoursing topics like [[racism]], [[poverty]], [[Romance (love)|romance]], self-improvement, and the welfare of children and the world.\n\n''Dangerous'' features catchy pop hooks and choruses while also introducing [[Underground music|underground sounds]] to a mainstream audience. The album's tone is noted by critics as gritty and urban, with sounds including honking horns, sliding chains, swinging gates, breaking glass, crashing metal. Throughout the album Jackson also implements [[beatboxing]], [[scat singing]], and [[finger snapping]]. The album is considered an artistic change for Jackson, with his music focusing to more socially conscious material, and a broader range of sounds and styles.\n\n''Dangerous'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], as well as in ten other countries' charts. Nine singles premiered between November 1991 and December 1993, including two exclusively released outside the United States. The album produced four singles that reached top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[Remember the Time]]\", \"[[In the Closet]]\", \"[[Will You Be There]]\" and number-one single \"[[Black or White]]\". The [[Dangerous World Tour]] grossed $100 million (equivalent to $177 million in 2019) which made it one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours#1990s|highest-grossing tours of the 1990s]]. All proceeds went to charities including Jackson's [[Heal the World Foundation]]. Jackson sold the film and broadcast rights for the 1992 [[Bucharest]] concert to [[HBO]] for $21 million, the highest amount for a concert performer to appear on television at the time.\n\n''Dangerous'' is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], having sold over 32 million copies worldwide and was certified [[RIAA certification|eight-times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in August 2018. An influence on contemporary pop and R&B artists, ''Dangerous'' has been rated by critics and publications as one of the greatest albums of all time, as well as considered by some critics as Jackson's artistic peak. It received four [[Grammy Award]] nominations and won [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]].\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the success of ''Bad'', Jackson wanted more independence and control over the creative process and separated himself from Quincy Jones to avoid the perception that his success was dependent on the long-time producer. Jackson began working on new tracks in 1989 with a handful of members from the B-team of ''Bad'', including Matt Forger and Bill Bottrell.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3847}} The album was originally conceived as a greatest-hits collection with a handful of new songs similar to Madonna's ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]''.

It was released by [[Epic Records]] on November 26, 1991. Jackson, [[Bill Bottrell]], [[Teddy Riley]], and [[Bruce Swedien]] co-produced the album. This was Jackson's first album since ''[[Forever, Michael]]'' (1975) not produced by longtime collaborator [[Quincy Jones]]. Featured artists include [[Heavy D]], [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Wreckx-n-Effect]]. The music incorporates [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[new jack swing]], a new genre in vogue at the time. Elements of [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Rock music|rock]] can also be found. Twelve of the album's fourteen songs were written or co-written by Jackson, discoursing topics like [[racism]], [[poverty]], [[Romance (love)|romance]], self-improvement, and the welfare of children and the world.\n\n''Dangerous'' features catchy pop hooks and choruses while also introducing [[Underground music|underground sounds]] to a mainstream audience. The album's tone is noted by critics as gritty and urban, with sounds including honking horns, sliding chains, swinging gates, breaking glass, crashing metal. Throughout the album Jackson also implements [[beatboxing]], [[scat singing]], and [[finger snapping]]. The album is considered an artistic change for Jackson, with his music focusing to more socially conscious material, and a broader range of sounds and styles.\n\n''Dangerous'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], as well as in ten other countries' charts. Nine singles premiered between November 1991 and December 1993, including two exclusively released outside the United States. The album produced four singles that reached top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[Remember the Time]]\", \"[[In the Closet]]\", \"[[Will You Be There]]\" and number-one single \"[[Black or White]]\". The [[Dangerous World Tour]] grossed $100 million (equivalent to $177 million in 2019) which made it one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours#1990s|highest-grossing tours of the 1990s]]. All proceeds went to charities including Jackson's [[Heal the World Foundation]]. Jackson sold the film and broadcast rights for the 1992 [[Bucharest]] concert to [[HBO]] for $21 million, the highest amount for a concert performer to appear on television at the time.\n\n''Dangerous'' is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], having sold over 32 million copies worldwide and was certified [[RIAA certification|eight-times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in August 2018. An influence on contemporary pop and R&B artists, ''Dangerous'' has been rated by critics and publications as one of the greatest albums of all time, as well as considered by some critics as Jackson's artistic peak. It received four [[Grammy Award]] nominations and won [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]].\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the success of ''Bad'', Jackson wanted more independence and control over the creative process and separated himself from Quincy Jones to avoid the perception that his success was dependent on the long-time producer. Jackson began working on new tracks in 1989 with a handful of members from the B-team of ''Bad'', including Matt Forger and Bill Bottrell.{{sfn|Vogel|2019|loc=3847}} The album was originally conceived as a greatest-hits collection with a handful of new songs similar to Madonna's ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]''.The proposed title was ''Decade''. Jackson signed off on the idea in early 1989 and test pressings were made by [[Epic Records]].

This species is found growing in high elevations in tropical america (especially along the coastal regions of Bolivia<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.tropicos.org/NamePage.aspx?nameid=35180718&projectid=16|title=Tropicos {{!}} Name - !Fissidens crispus Mont.|website=legacy.tropicos.org|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>) in addition to the USA, Mexico and Canada.

It grows in small patches with up to 10 mm long and 3 mm wide, 3-20 pairs of leaves. The stem is usually green to orange-red or dark reddish-brown. The central strand in the stem is hardly differentiated. The leaves are very contorted when dry, 2\u20136 times as long as wide, the leaves are lingulate to narrowly lanceolate with concave sides at the apex. ''F.limbatus'' leaves also have cells that are \u00b1 bulging (seen on the upper leaf cells) that could only be observed in cross-section.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Erzberger|first=Peter|date=2016|title=The genus Fissidens (Fissidentaceae, Bryophyta) in Hungary|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.17110/StudBot.2016.47.1.41|journal=STUDIA BOTANICA HUNGARICA|language=en|volume=47|pages=41\u2013139|issn=0301-7001}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Gametophyte]] ===\nThis species, like the rest of the ''[[Fissidens]]'' genus, is identified by its leaves that are arranged in two rows along the stem and are half-clinging the stem and the rear leaf towards the stem tip. The leaves are unique among other mosses as it has leaves with pocket-like flaps (common name Pocket Moss). The size of the [[gametophyte]] is a few millimetres long (measured as the length of the shoot). Sterile stems are often longer than fertile shoots, and plants from caves can produce long shoots with many leaf pairs. Most of the time, the lamina in ''F.limbatus'' is unistratose; however, it is partially bistratose occasionally.\n\n==== Leaf Structure ====\nEach leaf usually divided into three different parts:\n\n# The vaginant laminae (or lamina vera) is a boat-shaped or sheathing part of the leaf. The central cells of [[vaginant lamina]] somewhat more regularly arranged than ventral and dorsal laminae. The cells in this section are a little longer than wide, up to 12 micrometres wide.\n# The ventral lamina (or the apical lamina): the part of the leaf apical to the vaginant laminae on the upper side of the [[costa (botany)|costa]]. The central cells of apical and dorsal laminae are unistratose and smooth, up to 12 micrometres wide, hexagonal-rhomboidal shaped with thin walls and no marginal thickenings.\n# The dorsal lamina is the section of the leaf edge opposite the sheathing part and the ventral lamina, extending the total length of the leaf on the backside of the costa. Dorsal lamina is not decurrent, mostly decreased to extinction at the leaf base.\n\n==== [[Leaf margin]] ====\n[[File:F.limbatus leaf.png|thumb|''F.limbatus'' Leaf Poket ]]\nAnother critical characteristic of the ''Fissidens limbatus'' leaf is the margin, which is formed by a border called the [[limbidium]]: long, narrow, incrassate cells. These cells in F,limbatus are unistratose to bistratose. Furthermore, sometimes, the limbidium enters the sheathing part (vaginant lamina), which means that the border cells are separated from the margin by a row of [[Chlorophyllase|chlorophyllose]] cells. This is called an intralaminar or [[intramarginal limbidium]]. The limbidium also connects with the costa at the leaf tip (leaf apex), forming an apiculus, or ending a few cells before the apex. The costa could be up to 25 micrometres at the base (per-current).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== [[Rhizoid|Rhizoids]] ====\nRhizoids are usually limited to the bottom of stems and brown in colour \u00b1 smooth rhizoids. Sometimes, [[papillose]] rhizoids have been reported to occur in F.limbatus.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== [[Sporophyte]] ===\n[[File:Fissidens crispus 3c.jpg|thumb|''Fissidens limbatus'' Sull. Sporophyte ]]\nThe synoicous in F.limbatus could be autoicous or dioicous. The [[Archegonium|archegonia]] could grow up to 240 \u03bcm long when the shoot is autoicous; whereas, the [[Antheridium|antheridia]] that are carried on short basal branches or unusually small axillary buds, its length range between 120\u2013180 \u03bcm. Sporophytes are common in this moss and observed most of the time.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nThe seta is yellowish-red a few millimetres thick (2\u20136mm) often and ~9 mm long.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n==== Capsule ====\nThe sporangium capsule is very tiny 0.6-1 mm long that is erect or sometimes lightly curved, resembling a shape of an ellipsoid. The immature capsule of ''F.limbatus'' is green, and the operculum is fully enlarged and prominently enlarged above the annulus. The tip of the operculum is somewhat clear-green in colour.

It grows in small patches with up to 10 mm long and 3 mm wide, 3-20 pairs of leaves. The stem is usually green to orange-red or dark reddish-brown. The central strand in the stem is hardly differentiated. The leaves are very contorted when dry, 2\u20136 times as long as wide, the leaves are lingulate to narrowly lanceolate with concave sides at the apex. ''F.limbatus'' leaves also have cells that are \u00b1 bulging (seen on the upper leaf cells) that could only be observed in cross-section.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Erzberger|first=Peter|date=2016|title=The genus Fissidens (Fissidentaceae, Bryophyta) in Hungary|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.17110/StudBot.2016.47.1.41|journal=STUDIA BOTANICA HUNGARICA|language=en|volume=47|pages=41\u2013139|issn=0301-7001}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Gametophyte]] ===\nThis species, like the rest of the ''[[Fissidens]]'' genus, is identified by its leaves that are arranged in two rows along the stem and are half-clinging the stem and the rear leaf towards the stem tip. The leaves are unique among other mosses as it has leaves with pocket-like flaps (common name Pocket Moss). The size of the [[gametophyte]] is a few millimetres long (measured as the length of the shoot). Sterile stems are often longer than fertile shoots, and plants from caves can produce long shoots with many leaf pairs. Most of the time, the lamina in ''F.limbatus'' is unistratose; however, it is partially bistratose occasionally.\n\n==== Leaf Structure ====\nEach leaf usually divided into three different parts:\n\n# The vaginant laminae (or lamina vera) is a boat-shaped or sheathing part of the leaf. The central cells of [[vaginant lamina]] somewhat more regularly arranged than ventral and dorsal laminae. The cells in this section are a little longer than wide, up to 12 micrometres wide.\n# The ventral lamina (or the apical lamina): the part of the leaf apical to the vaginant laminae on the upper side of the [[costa (botany)|costa]]. The central cells of apical and dorsal laminae are unistratose and smooth, up to 12 micrometres wide, hexagonal-rhomboidal shaped with thin walls and no marginal thickenings.\n# The dorsal lamina is the section of the leaf edge opposite the sheathing part and the ventral lamina, extending the total length of the leaf on the backside of the costa. Dorsal lamina is not decurrent, mostly decreased to extinction at the leaf base.\n\n==== [[Leaf margin]] ====\n[[File:F.limbatus leaf.png|thumb|''F.limbatus'' Leaf Poket ]]\nAnother critical characteristic of the ''Fissidens limbatus'' leaf is the margin, which is formed by a border called the [[limbidium]]: long, narrow, incrassate cells. These cells in F,limbatus are unistratose to bistratose. Furthermore, sometimes, the limbidium enters the sheathing part (vaginant lamina), which means that the border cells are separated from the margin by a row of [[Chlorophyllase|chlorophyllose]] cells. This is called an intralaminar or [[intramarginal limbidium]]. The limbidium also connects with the costa at the leaf tip (leaf apex), forming an apiculus, or ending a few cells before the apex. The costa could be up to 25 micrometres at the base (per-current).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== [[Rhizoid|Rhizoids]] ====\nRhizoids are usually limited to the bottom of stems and brown in colour \u00b1 smooth rhizoids. Sometimes, [[papillose]] rhizoids have been reported to occur in F.limbatus.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== [[Sporophyte]] ===\n[[File:Fissidens crispus 3c.jpg|thumb|''Fissidens limbatus'' Sull. Sporophyte ]]\nThe synoicous in F.limbatus could be autoicous or dioicous. The [[Archegonium|archegonia]] could grow up to 240 \u03bcm long when the shoot is autoicous; whereas, the [[Antheridium|antheridia]] that are carried on short basal branches or unusually small axillary buds, its length range between 120\u2013180 \u03bcm. Sporophytes are common in this moss and observed most of the time.  \n\nThe seta is yellowish-red a few millimetres thick (2\u20136mm) often and ~9 mm long. \n\n==== Capsule ====\nThe sporangium capsule is very tiny 0.6-1 mm long that is erect or sometimes lightly curved, resembling a shape of an ellipsoid. The immature capsule of ''F.limbatus'' is green, and the operculum is fully enlarged and prominently enlarged above the annulus. The tip of the operculum is somewhat clear-green in colour. The capsule turns dark green to brown when maturing, except for the [[apophysis]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, keeps it light green colour and the operculum that turns red as each sporocyte has experienced meiosis and has produced four spores at this time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=Dale M.

On the one hand, one hypothesis proposes that some animals have complex cognitive processes which allow them to attribute mental states to other individuals, sometimes called \"mind-reading\".

Several experimental methods have been developed which are widely used or suggested as appropriate tests for nonhuman animals possessing ToM. Some studies look at communication between individuals of the same species ([[Biological specificity|intraspecific]]) whereas others investigate behaviour between individuals of different species ([[Biological specificity|interspecific]]).\n\n===Knower-Guesser===\nThe Knower-Guesser method has been used in many studies relating to animal ToM.  Animals are tested in a two-stage procedure. At the beginning of each trial in the first discrimination training stage, an animal is in a room with two humans. One human, designated the \"Guesser,\" leaves the room, and the other, the \"Knower,\" baits one of several containers. The containers are screened so that the animal can see who does the baiting, but not where the food has been placed. After baiting, the Guesser returns to the room, the screen is removed, and each human points directly at a container. The Knower points at the baited container, and the Guesser at one of the other three, chosen at random. The animal is allowed to search one container and to keep the food if it is found.<ref name=\"Heyes1998\" />\n\n===Competitive feeding paradigm===\nThe competitive feeding paradigm approach is considered by some as evidence that animals have some understanding of the relationship between \"seeing\" and \"knowing\".<ref name=\"Heyes2015\" />\n\nAt the beginning of each trial in the paradigm, a subordinate animal (the individual thought to be doing the mind-reading) and a dominant animal are kept on opposite sides of a test arena which contains two visual barriers. In all trials, a researcher enters the enclosure and places food on the subordinate's side of one of the visual barriers (one baiting event), and in some trials the researcher re-enters the enclosure several seconds later and moves the food to the subordinate's side of the other visual barrier (second baiting event).  The door to the subordinate's cage is open during any baiting by the researcher. The conditions vary according to whether the dominant's door is open or closed during the baiting events, and therefore whether the subordinate individual can see the dominant. After baiting, both of the animals are released into the test arena, with the subordinate being released several seconds before the dominant. If the animals possess ToM, it is expected that subordinates are more likely to gain the food, and more likely to approach the food under several circumstances: (1) When the dominant's door is closed during trials with a single baiting event; (2) when the dominant's door is open during a first baiting event but closed during a second; (3) in single baiting event trials with the dominant's door open, subordinates are more likely to get the food when they compete at the end of the trial with a dominant individual who did not see the baiting.\n\n===Goggles Method===\nIn one suggested protocol, chimpanzees are given first-hand experience of wearing two mirrored visors. One of the visors is transparent whereas the other is not. The visors themselves are of markedly different colours or shapes. During the subsequent test session, the chimpanzees are given the opportunity to use their species-typical begging behaviour to request food from one of the two humans, one wearing the transparent visor and the other wearing the opaque. If chimpanzees possess ToM, it would be expected they would beg more often from the human wearing the transparent visor.\n\n===False Belief Test===\nA method used to test ToM in human children has been adapted for testing non-human animals. The basis of the test is to track the gaze of the animal.  One human hides an object in view of a second human who then leaves the room.  The object is then removed.  The second human returns whereupon they will mistakenly look for the object where they last saw it.  If the animal stares first and longest at the location where the human last saw the object, this suggests they expect him to believe it is still hidden in that place.<ref name=\"Smith2016\">{{cite web|title=Apes understand that some things are all in your head|date=October 16, 2016|accessdate=January 3, 2017|url=https://today.duke.edu/2016/10/falsebeliefs|publisher=DukeToday|author=Smith, R.A.}}</ref>\n\n==In nonhuman primates==\n\nMany ToM studies have used nonhuman primates (NHPs).

They protect their caches from being pilfered by conspecifics using aggression, dominance and re-caching.  Potential pilferers rarely approach caches until the storing birds have left the cache vicinity.  When storers are experimentally prevented from leaving the vicinity of the cache, pilferers first search at places other than the cache sites. When ravens (''Corvus corax'') witness a conspecific making caches, to pilfer those caches they (1) delay approaching the cache only when in the presence of the storer, and (2) quickly engage in searching away from the caches when together with dominant storers.  These behaviours raise the possibility that ravens are capable of withholding their intentions, and also providing false information to avoid provoking the storer's aggression to protect its cache.

The storing raven generalized from their own experience when using the peephole to pilfer the human-made caches and predicted that the audible (raven) competitors could potentially see their caches through the peep-hole and took appropriate action, i.e. the storing ravens finished their caches more quickly and they returned to improve their caches less often.

The human then told the dog to 'Fetch' without indicating either toy in any way. In a control, the human sat on the opposite side but with their back turned so that they could see neither toy.  In a second control, the human sat on the same side as the dog such that they could see both toys. When the toys were differentiable, dogs approached the toy behind the transparent barrier in experimental as compared to \"back-turned\" and \"same-side\" condition.

Several experimental methods have been developed which are widely used or suggested as appropriate tests for nonhuman animals possessing ToM. Some studies look at communication between individuals of the same species ([[Biological specificity|intraspecific]]) whereas others investigate behaviour between individuals of different species ([[Biological specificity|interspecific]]).\n\n===Knower-Guesser===\nThe Knower-Guesser method has been used in many studies relating to animal ToM.  Animals are tested in a two-stage procedure. At the beginning of each trial in the first discrimination training stage, an animal is in a room with two humans. One human, designated the \"Guesser,\" leaves the room, and the other, the \"Knower,\" baits one of several containers. The containers are screened so that the animal can see who does the baiting, but not where the food has been placed. After baiting, the Guesser returns to the room, the screen is removed, and each human points directly at a container. The Knower points at the baited container, and the Guesser at one of the other three, chosen at random. The animal is allowed to search one container and to keep the food if it is found.<ref name=\"Heyes1998\" />\n\n===Competitive feeding paradigm===\nThe competitive feeding paradigm approach is considered by some as evidence that animals have some understanding of the relationship between \"seeing\" and \"knowing\".<ref name=\"Heyes2015\" />\n\nAt the beginning of each trial in the paradigm, a subordinate animal (the individual thought to be doing the mind-reading) and a dominant animal are kept on opposite sides of a test arena which contains two visual barriers. In all trials, a researcher enters the enclosure and places food on the subordinate's side of one of the visual barriers (one baiting event), and in some trials the researcher re-enters the enclosure several seconds later and moves the food to the subordinate's side of the other visual barrier (second baiting event).  The door to the subordinate's cage is open during any baiting by the researcher. The conditions vary according to whether the dominant's door is open or closed during the baiting events, and therefore whether the subordinate individual can see the dominant. After baiting, both of the animals are released into the test arena, with the subordinate being released several seconds before the dominant. If the animals possess ToM, it is expected that subordinates are more likely to gain the food, and more likely to approach the food under several circumstances: (1) When the dominant's door is closed during trials with a single baiting event; (2) when the dominant's door is open during a first baiting event but closed during a second; (3) in single baiting event trials with the dominant's door open, subordinates are more likely to get the food when they compete at the end of the trial with a dominant individual who did not see the baiting.\n\n===Goggles Method===\nIn one suggested protocol, chimpanzees are given first-hand experience of wearing two mirrored visors. One of the visors is transparent whereas the other is not. The visors themselves are of markedly different colours or shapes. During the subsequent test session, the chimpanzees are given the opportunity to use their species-typical begging behaviour to request food from one of the two humans, one wearing the transparent visor and the other wearing the opaque. If chimpanzees possess ToM, it would be expected they would beg more often from the human wearing the transparent visor.\n\n===False Belief Test===\nA method used to test ToM in human children has been adapted for testing non-human animals. The basis of the test is to track the gaze of the animal.  One human hides an object in view of a second human who then leaves the room.  The object is then removed.

They protect their caches from being pilfered by conspecifics using aggression, dominance and re-caching.  Potential pilferers rarely approach caches until the storing birds have left the cache vicinity.  When storers are experimentally prevented from leaving the vicinity of the cache, pilferers first search at places other than the cache sites. When ravens (''Corvus corax'') witness a conspecific making caches, to pilfer those caches they (1) delay approaching the cache only when in the presence of the storer, and (2) quickly engage in searching away from the caches when together with dominant storers.  These behaviours raise the possibility that ravens are capable of withholding their intentions, and also providing false information to avoid provoking the storer's aggression to protect its cache.  Ravens adjust their pilfering behaviour according to when the storers are likely to defend the caches.

The storing raven generalized from their own experience when using the peephole to pilfer the human-made caches and predicted that the audible (raven) competitors could potentially see their caches through the peep-hole and took appropriate action, i.e. the storing ravens finished their caches more quickly and they returned to improve their caches less often.

Sherie Randolph, in her book ''Florynce \"Flo\" Kennedy: The Life of a Radical Black Feminist'', quotes Flo saying: \"My main message is that we have a pathologically, institutionally racist, sexist, classist society. And that niggerizing techniques that are used don't only damage black people, but they also damage women, gay people, ex-prison inmates, prostitutes, children, old people, handicapped people, native Americans. And that if we can begin to analyze the pathology of oppression\u2026 we would learn a lot about how to deal with it.\"<ref name=\":2\">Randolph, Sherie (2015).

Kennedy had a summer home on [[Fire Island]], and was a popular fixture on the social scene there, entertaining many activists whom she invited to visit her.\n\nKennedy held regular salons in her apartment on East 48th Street, off Fifth Avenue, in New York City. She would preside over networking and facilitate people meeting each other, sharing ideas, and was always coming up with projects. She would give tours of her apartment, directing guests to the \"filthy room\" and the \"dirty room\".\n\n=== Early activism ===\nHer activism began early. According to Jason Chambers in his book ''Madison Avenue and the Color Line: African Americans in the Advertising Industry'', \"After graduating high school, [Kennedy] organized a successful boycott against a Coca-Cola bottler who refused to hire black truck drivers.\"<ref>Chambers, Jason (2008).

She was the only black person among eight women in her class.<ref name=\"obit\" /> In a 1946 sociology class at Columbia University Kennedy wrote a paper that analogized the discourses of race and sex. \"Kennedy hoped that comparing 'women' and 'Negroes' would hasten the formation of alliances\".<ref>Mayeri, Serena (2011), ''Reasoning from Race: Feminism, Law, and the Civil Rights Revolution'', Harvard University Press, p. 9.</ref>\n\n== Career and Acting ==\nKennedy graduated from [[Columbia Law School]] in 1951.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nBy 1954 she had opened her own office, doing matrimonial work, and some assigned criminal cases. She was a member of the [[Young Democrats of America|Young Democrats]]. In 1956, she formed a legal partnership with the lawyer who had represented [[Billie Holiday]] in regards to drug charges.

In 1999 the [[City University of New York]] awarded her the Century Award.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Activism ==\n\nKennedy used [[Intersectionality]] as her approach to activism. Sherie Randolph, in her book ''Florynce \"Flo\" Kennedy: The Life of a Radical Black Feminist'', quotes Flo saying: \"My main message is that we have a pathologically, institutionally racist, sexist, classist society. And that niggerizing techniques that are used don't only damage black people, but they also damage women, gay people, ex-prison inmates, prostitutes, children, old people, handicapped people, native Americans. And that if we can begin to analyze the pathology of oppression\u2026 we would learn a lot about how to deal with it.\"<ref name=\":2\">Randolph, Sherie (2015).

Kennedy had a summer home on [[Fire Island]], and was a popular fixture on the social scene there, entertaining many activists whom she invited to visit her.\n\nKennedy held regular salons in her apartment on East 48th Street, off Fifth Avenue, in New York City. She would preside over networking and facilitate people meeting each other, sharing ideas, and was always coming up with projects. She would give tours of her apartment, directing guests to the \"filthy room\" and the \"dirty room\".\n\n=== Early activism ===\nHer activism began early. According to Jason Chambers in his book ''Madison Avenue and the Color Line: African Americans in the Advertising Industry'', \"After graduating high school, [Kennedy] organized a successful boycott against a Coca-Cola bottler who refused to hire black truck drivers.\"<ref>Chambers, Jason (2008).
