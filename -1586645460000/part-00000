Designed by British naval engineer [[George Thurston]], she was the third launched of the four {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser}}s. [[Laid down]] in 1912 at the [[Mitsubishi|Mitsubishi Shipyards]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], ''Kirishima'' was formally [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in 1915 on the same day as her [[sister ship]], {{ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}}. ''Kirishima'' patrolled on occasion off the Chinese coast during World War I, and helped with rescue efforts following the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake]].\n\nStarting in 1927, ''Kirishima''{{'}}s first reconstruction rebuilt her as a [[battleship]], strengthening her armor and improving her speed. From 1934, a second reconstruction completely rebuilt her [[superstructure]], upgraded her engine plant, and equipped her with [[Aircraft catapult|launch catapults]] for [[floatplane]]s. Now fast enough to accompany Japan's growing [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] fleet, she was reclassified as a [[fast battleship]]. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], ''Kirishima'' acted primarily as a support vessel and troop transport, moving army troops to mainland China. On the eve of World War II, she sailed as part of Vice-Admiral [[Chuichi Nagumo]]'s ''[[Kido Butai]]'' as an escort for the six carriers that [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941.\n\nAs part of the [[Third Battleship Division]], ''Kirishima'' participated in many of the Imperial Japanese Navy's early actions in 1942, providing support for the invasion of the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia) and in the [[Indian Ocean raid]] of April 1942. During the [[Battle of Midway]], she provided escort to Nagumo's four carriers, before redeploying to the [[Solomon Islands]] during the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]]. She escorted Japanese carrier fleets during the battles of the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Eastern Solomons]] and [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]], before sailing as part of a bombardment force under Admiral [[Nobutake Kond\u014d]] during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. On the evening of 13 November 1942, ''Kirishima'' engaged American [[cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s alongside her sister ship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}}. On the night of 14/15 November, in one of only two battleship duels of the [[Pacific War]], ''Kirishima'' attacked and damaged the American battleship {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|6}} before being fatally crippled in turn by the battleship {{USS|Washington|BB-56|6}}. ''Kirishima'' capsized and sank in the early morning on 15 November 1942 in [[Ironbottom Sound]].\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[File:Kirishima Launch.jpg|thumb|left|''Kirishima'' being launched, December 1, 1913]]\n''Kirishima'' was the third of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s {{Sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser|1}}s, a group of [[capital ship]]s designed by the British naval engineer [[George Thurston]].<ref name=kongoclass>{{cite web |url= http://www.combinedfleet.com/ships/kongo|title= Combined Fleet \u2013 ''Kongo'' class battlecruiser|accessdate=2010-08-15 |publisher=Parshall, Jon; Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp, & Allyn Nevitt |date= }}</ref>  The class was ordered in 1910 in the Japanese Emergency Naval Expansion Bill after the commissioning of {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}} in 1908.<ref name=cfrecord>{{Cite web |url= http://combinedfleet.com/Kirishima.htm|title= Combined Fleet \u2013 tabular history of ''Kirishima''|accessdate=23 May 2010 |work= |publisher=Parshall, Jon; Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp, & Allyn Nevitt |date=}}</ref> The four battlecruisers of the ''Kong\u014d'' class were designed to match the naval capabilities of the other major powers at the time; they have been called the battlecruiser version of the British (formerly [[Ottoman Navy|Turkish]]) battleship {{HMS|Erin|1913|6}}.<ref name=\"Conway's\">Gardiner and Gray (1980), p. 234</ref><ref name=\"jackson-08-27\">Jackson (2008), p. 27</ref>  With their heavy armament and armor protection (which took up 23.3% of their approximately 30,000&nbsp;ton displacement),<ref name=\"Conway's\"/> ''Kirishima'' and her sister ships were vastly superior to any other Japanese [[capital ship]] afloat at the time.<ref name=\"jackson-08-27\"/>\n\nThe [[keel]] of ''Kirishima'' was laid down at the [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] shipyards of [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] on 17 March 1912, with most of the parts used in her construction manufactured in Japan.<ref name=\"Conway's\"/><ref name=cfrecord/> Due to a shortage of available [[slipway]]s, ''Kirishima'' and her sister ship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}} were the first two capital ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy to be built in private Japanese shipyards.<ref name=\"Conway's\"/>  After her launch on 1 December 1913, ''Kirishima''{{'}}s [[fitting-out]] began later that month.<ref name=\"jackson-08-27\"/>  On 15 December 1914, Captain Kamaya Rokuro was assigned as her chief equipping officer,<ref name=cfrecord/> and she was completed on 19 April 1915.<ref name=\"Conway's\"/>\n\n===Armament===\n''Kirishima''{{'}}s main battery consisted of eight {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} heavy-caliber main guns in four twin [[gun turret|turrets]] (two forward, two aft).<ref name=kongoclass/> The turrets were noted by the US Office of Naval Intelligence to be \"similar to the British 15-inch turrets\",<ref name=NW-14/> with improvements made in flash-tightness.

Designed by British naval engineer [[George Thurston]], she was the third launched of the four {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser}}s. [[Laid down]] in 1912 at the [[Mitsubishi|Mitsubishi Shipyards]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], ''Kirishima'' was formally [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in 1915 on the same day as her [[sister ship]], {{ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}}. ''Kirishima'' patrolled on occasion off the Chinese coast during World War I, and helped with rescue efforts following the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake]].\n\nStarting in 1927, ''Kirishima''{{'}}s first reconstruction rebuilt her as a [[battleship]], strengthening her armor and improving her speed. From 1934, a second reconstruction completely rebuilt her [[superstructure]], upgraded her engine plant, and equipped her with [[Aircraft catapult|launch catapults]] for [[floatplane]]s. Now fast enough to accompany Japan's growing [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] fleet, she was reclassified as a [[fast battleship]]. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], ''Kirishima'' acted primarily as a support vessel and troop transport, moving army troops to mainland China. On the eve of World War II, she sailed as part of Vice-Admiral [[Chuichi Nagumo]]'s ''[[Kido Butai]]'' as an escort for the six carriers that [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941.\n\nAs part of the [[Third Battleship Division]], ''Kirishima'' participated in many of the Imperial Japanese Navy's early actions in 1942, providing support for the invasion of the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia) and in the [[Indian Ocean raid]] of April 1942. During the [[Battle of Midway]], she provided escort to Nagumo's four carriers, before redeploying to the [[Solomon Islands]] during the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]]. She escorted Japanese carrier fleets during the battles of the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Eastern Solomons]] and [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]], before sailing as part of a bombardment force under Admiral [[Nobutake Kond\u014d]] during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. On the evening of 13 November 1942, ''Kirishima'' engaged American [[cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s alongside her sister ship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}}. On the night of 14/15 November, in one of only two battleship duels of the [[Pacific War]], ''Kirishima'' attacked and damaged the American battleship {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|6}} before being fatally crippled in turn by the battleship {{USS|Washington|BB-56|6}}.

On 25 February 1933, based on a report by the [[Lytton Commission]], the League of Nations agreed that Japan had violated Chinese sovereignty in its invasion of Manchuria.<ref name=jackson-00-72>Jackson (2000), p. 72</ref> Refusing to accept the organization's judgment, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations the same day.<ref name=jackson-00-72/>  Immediately following, Japan also withdrew from the Washington and [[London Naval Treaty|London Naval Treaties]], thus removing all restrictions on the number and size of her capital ships.<ref name=\"willmott35\"/>\n\n===1934\u20131941: Fast battleship===\n[[File:Kirishima and Akagi at Sukumo Bay 1939.jpg|thumb|right|''Kirishima'' and the fast carrier ''Akagi'' off Sukumo, April 1939]]\nOn 18 November 1934, ''Kirishima'' was drydocked in [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal]] in preparation for her second reconstruction, which would enable her to function alongside Japan's growing fleet of fast carriers. Her stern was lengthened by {{convert|26|ft|m}}, while her superstructure was rebuilt to allow for new fire-control mechanisms.<ref name=cfrecord/> Her boilers were removed and replaced with eight new oil-fired Kampon Boilers, and she received newer geared turbines.<ref name=jackson-08-27/> The elevation of her main and secondary battery was increased, and she was equipped with two [[Nakajima E8N|Nakajima E8N \"Dave\"]] and [[Kawanishi E7K|Kawanishi E7K \"Alf\"]] reconnaissance [[floatplane]]s. To this end, [[aircraft catapult]]s and launch-rails were also refitted.<ref name=cfrecord/> Her older 3-inch guns were removed and replaced with eight 5-inch dual-purpose guns. She was also outfitted with twenty Type 96 25&nbsp;mm antiaircraft guns in twin turrets, while two of her 6-inch guns and her remaining torpedo tubes were removed.<ref name=stille17>Stille, p. 17</ref>\n\n''Kirishima''{{'}}s armor was also extensively upgraded. Her main belt was strengthened to a uniform thickness of 8&nbsp;inches (as opposed to varying thicknesses of 6\u20138&nbsp;inches before the upgrades), while diagonal bulkheads of a depth ranging from {{convert|5|to|8|in|mm|0}} reinforced the main armored belt.<ref name=mccurtie185>McCurtie, p. 185</ref> The turret armor was strengthened to {{convert|10|in|mm|0}}, while {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} were added to portions of the deck armor.<ref name=mccurtie185/> The armor around her ammunition magazines was also strengthened over the course of the refit. The reconstruction was declared complete on 8 June 1936. Capable of speeds of up to {{convert|30.5|kn}}, ''Kirishima'' was reclassified as a fast battleship.<ref name=willmott35>Willmott, p. 35</ref>\n\nIn August 1936, ''Kirishima'' departed Sasebo alongside {{ship|Japanese battleship|Fuso||2}} to patrol the Chinese coast off [[Amoy]]. From March 1937 to April 1939, she was frequently deployed as a support vessel and troop transport during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. In November 1938, ''Kirishima'' was designated the command vessel of the Third Battleship Division, and was under the command of Rear Admiral [[Chuichi Nagumo]]. In November 1939, she was placed in reserve and fitted with additional armor on the front faces of her turrets and barbettes.<ref name=cfrecord/>\n\nOn 11 November 1941, after a series of transfers between Japanese naval bases, ''Kirishima'' was outfitted in preparation for coming hostilities and assigned\u2014alongside her sister ships\u2014to the Third Battleship Division. On 26 November, ''Kirishima'' departed [[Iturup|Hitokappu Bay]], [[Kurile Islands]] in the company of ''Hiei'' and six Japanese fast carriers of the [[1st Air Fleet (Japan)|First Air Fleet Striking Force]] ({{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|S\u014dry\u016b||2}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}}, and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}).<ref>Willmott, p. 50</ref> On 7 December 1941, aircraft from these six carriers attacked the United States Pacific Fleet at their home base of [[Pearl Harbor]], sinking four U.S. Navy battleships and numerous other vessels.

She provided escort during the invasion of [[New Britain]] on 17 January before returning to Truk. She sortied again in response to [[Marshalls-Gilberts raids|American carrier raids]] in the [[Marshall Islands|Marshall]] and [[Gilbert Islands]].<ref name=cfrecord/> In March 1942, while supporting fleet operations off of [[Java]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]], one of ''Kirishima''{{'}}s floatplanes bombed an enemy merchant vessel. South of Java, the Japanese fleet was surprised by the appearance of the destroyer {{USS|Edsall|DD-219|6}}. ''Hiei'' and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Chikuma|1938|2}} initially opened fire on the ship but failed to score any hits. After [[dive-bomber]]s from three of Admiral Nagumo's carriers immobilized the destroyer, ''Kirishima'' and the other two ships resumed firing on ''Edsall'' until she sank.<ref name=cfrecord/>\n\nIn April 1942, ''Kirishima'' and the Third Battleship division joined five fleet carriers and two cruisers in an [[Indian Ocean Raid|attack against British naval bases in the Indian Ocean]]. On 5 April\u2014Easter Sunday\u2014the Japanese fleet attacked the harbor at [[Colombo]] in [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], while seaplanes from the {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tone|1937|2}} spotted two fleeing British cruisers, both of which were later sunk by aerial attack.<ref>Jackson (2000), p. 119</ref> A floatplane from ''Kirishima'' also strafed a withdrawing [[oil tanker]].<ref name=cfrecord/> On 8 April, Japanese carrier aircraft attacked the [[Royal Navy]] base at [[Trincomalee]] in Ceylon, only to find that all of Admiral [[James Somerville]]'s remaining warships had withdrawn the previous night. Returning from the attack, a floatplane from ''Kirishima''{{'}}s sister ship ''Haruna'' spotted the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} and escorting destroyer HMAS ''Vampire'', which were quickly sunk by a massive aerial attack.<ref>Jackson (2000), p. 120</ref><ref>'Scrap Iron Flotilla' (1976), p. 148-149</ref> Upon returning to Japan, ''Kirishima'' was drydocked and her secondary armament configuration modified with the addition of 25&nbsp;mm antiaircraft guns in twin mounts.<ref name=cfrecord/><ref>Stille, p. 18</ref>\n\nIn June 1942, ''Kirishima'' sailed as part of the Carrier Strike Force during the [[Battle of Midway]], providing escort for Admiral Nagumo's four fast carriers alongside ''Haruna''.<ref name=stille19>Stille, p. 19</ref> Following the disastrous battle, during which all four Japanese aircraft carriers were destroyed, she took on survivors from the carriers before returning to Japan.<ref name=cfrecord/> In August 1942, she departed Japan for the [[Solomon Islands]] in the company of ''Hiei'', three carriers, three cruisers and eleven destroyers, in response to the [[Battle of Guadalcanal|American invasion of Guadalcanal]]. She escorted Japanese carriers during the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], during which the light carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ry\u016bj\u014d||2}} was sunk.<ref name=stille19/> Following the battle, the fleet returned to Truk Naval Base. During the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], ''Kirishima'' was part of Rear Admiral [[Hiroaki Abe]]'s Vanguard Force, which provided distant cover to Nagumo's carrier groups.<ref name=stille19/> She was attacked by American dive-bombers on 26 October, yet remained undamaged.\n\nOn 10 November 1942, ''Kirishima'' departed Truk alongside ''Hiei'' and eleven destroyers in preparation to shell American positions on [[Guadalcanal]] in advance of a major transport convoy of Japanese troops. U.S. Navy reconnaissance aircraft spotted the Japanese fleet several days in advance, and a U. S. Navy force of two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers and eight destroyers was deployed under the command of Rear Admiral [[Daniel J. Callaghan]] in [[Ironbottom Sound]] to meet them.<ref>Hammel, pp. 99\u2013107</ref> At 01:24 on 13 November, the Japanese force was detected {{convert|28000|yd|km}} out by the light cruiser {{USS|Helena|CL-50|6}}. In the ensuing [[First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], the American task force concentrated the majority of their firepower on the battleship ''Hiei''.<ref name=stille19/> This enabled ''Kirishima'' to score multiple hits on the ''Helena'' and heavy cruiser {{USS|San Francisco|CA-38|6}}, while ''Hiei'' crippled the light cruiser {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|6}}, killing Rear Admiral [[Norman Scott (Medal of Honor)|Norman Scott]].<ref>Stille, pp. 19\u201320</ref> Both ''Hiei'' and ''Kirishima'' then raked ''San Francisco'' with shellfire, killing Rear Admiral Callaghan.<ref>Morison, p. 247</ref> However, ''Hiei'' was in turn crippled by ''San Francisco'' and several American destroyers. With ''Hiei'' effectively out of the battle, ''Kirishima'' and the surviving destroyers withdrew to the north.

Harris is widely regarded as one of the toughest [[Football (soccer) positions|defenders]] of his era \u2013 along with players such as [[Tommy Smith (footballer born 1945)|Tommy Smith]] and [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] \u2013 hence the [[nickname]]{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. His brother [[Allan Harris]] was also a professional footballer and they were teammates at Chelsea in the mid-1960s.\n\n==Chelsea==\nHarris was a member of the Chelsea side which won the [[FA Youth Cup]] in 1961 and made his senior club debut in February 1962 in a 1\u20130 win against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. Within a year, he had established himself as a regular in the side, a position he would hold for the next eighteen years. He formed an important part of new Chelsea manager [[Tommy Docherty]]'s youth-oriented re-building of the club after [[relegation]] from the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] alongside the likes of [[Peter Bonetti]], [[Peter Osgood]] and [[Bobby Tambling]].\n\nUpon the club's return to the top division, Harris solidified his reputation as an uncompromising \u2013 yet talented \u2013 defender with a series of strong (and sometimes notorious) performances. His first honours with Chelsea came with a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in [[1965 Football League Cup Final|1965]]. In the same season, Chelsea were challenging for the league title for most of the year but ultimately finished third after winning just one of their final five matches. He became club [[Captain (association football)|captain]] the following year when [[Terry Venables]] left for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and became the youngest ever captain to lead out a side in the [[1967 FA Cup Final]], although they lost 2\u20131 to Tottenham. Chelsea, led by Harris, reached another FA Cup final three years later, this time against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] \u2013 a side then at their peak in English football. He won four caps for [[England national under-23 football team|England U23]] between 1966 and 1968.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng-u23-intres-det.html|title=England \u2013 U-23 International Results \u2013 Details|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThat [[1970 FA Cup Final]] is notorious for being one of the most physical of all time, it saw Harris come into his own in the role of both inspirational leader and uncompromising tackler. With Leeds having taken a 2\u20131 lead at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] with just six minutes remaining, it was his quick [[Indirect free kick|free kick]] which led to [[Ian Hutchinson (footballer born 1948)|Ian Hutchinson]]'s  headed equaliser to take the game to a replay. During the replay at [[Old Trafford]] his late tackle on Leeds' playmaker [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]] after just eight minutes (just one of many late tackles committed by both sides), left the latter a virtual passenger for the rest of the match: Chelsea eventually won 2\u20131 after extra-time.\n\nThe following season saw Harris lift Chelsea's first major [[Europe]]an honour \u2013 the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] \u2013 in another replayed final against [[Real Madrid]] in [[Athens]]. Chelsea also reached a second League Cup final in 1972, but surprisingly lost to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] in what proved to be his last major final for the club.\n\n==Moves==\nWhile many of Chelsea's star players departed during the 1970s ( due to Peter Osgood and Alan Hudson falling out with manager Dave Sexton, and due to the financial crisis caused by the building of the new East Stand, and the financial impact of relegation )  Harris remained ever-present in the side throughout a decade which saw them relegated twice and promoted once, although he was replaced as Club Captain by [[John Hollins]] at the tail end of the 1971/72 season. Harris was primarily a central defender in the mould of Bobby Moore and Norman Hunter but in later years he was often played out of position as circumstances dictated. After the retirement of Eddie McCreadie he played at left back for a considerable time and was used as cover at right back when injuries left the financially struggling Chelsea short of cover. In the closing stages of his career he also played as a holding midfield player in a role similar to Claude Makelele, providing a screen for a defence that was often caught out by counter-attacks. Over an 18-year period Harris was rarely out of the first team. In 10 seasons he averaged 41 league games out of 42 and in 5 other seasons he averaged over 37 games. He finally left Chelsea in 1980 to become a player-coach at [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]], having played a record 795 games for Chelsea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bounder.friardale.co.uk/Appearances/He-Ho.htm |title=Players Appearances He-Ho |publisher=Bounder.friardale.co.uk |date= |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref> He later had a brief stint as player-manager of [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]].\n\n==In retirement==\nHarris was a professional greyhound trainer for several years during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barnes/Sellers|first=Julia/John|title=Ladbrokes Greyhound Fact File|year=1992|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-22-8}}</ref> He is now a football [[pundit (politics)|pundit]] (especially on Chelsea), an in-demand after-dinner speaker and has written an [[autobiography]], ''Chopper: A Chelsea Legend''. He also has a suite named after him at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].\n\nOn 13 November 2007, he took part in the limited edition autobiography CD series ''60 minutes with...'', when he was interviewed by David Knight.

Harris is widely regarded as one of the toughest [[Football (soccer) positions|defenders]] of his era \u2013 along with players such as [[Tommy Smith (footballer born 1945)|Tommy Smith]] and [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] \u2013 hence the [[nickname]]{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. His brother [[Allan Harris]] was also a professional footballer and they were teammates at Chelsea in the mid-1960s.\n\n==Chelsea==\nHarris was a member of the Chelsea side which won the [[FA Youth Cup]] in 1961 and made his senior club debut in February 1962 in a 1\u20130 win against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. Within a year, he had established himself as a regular in the side, a position he would hold for the next eighteen years. He formed an important part of new Chelsea manager [[Tommy Docherty]]'s youth-oriented re-building of the club after [[relegation]] from the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] alongside the likes of [[Peter Bonetti]], [[Peter Osgood]] and [[Bobby Tambling]].\n\nUpon the club's return to the top division, Harris solidified his reputation as an uncompromising \u2013 yet talented \u2013 defender with a series of strong (and sometimes notorious) performances. His first honours with Chelsea came with a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in [[1965 Football League Cup Final|1965]]. In the same season, Chelsea were challenging for the league title for most of the year but ultimately finished third after winning just one of their final five matches. He became club [[Captain (association football)|captain]] the following year when [[Terry Venables]] left for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and became the youngest ever captain to lead out a side in the [[1967 FA Cup Final]], although they lost 2\u20131 to Tottenham. Chelsea, led by Harris, reached another FA Cup final three years later, this time against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] \u2013 a side then at their peak in English football. He won four caps for [[England national under-23 football team|England U23]] between 1966 and 1968.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng-u23-intres-det.html|title=England \u2013 U-23 International Results \u2013 Details|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThat [[1970 FA Cup Final]] is notorious for being one of the most physical of all time, it saw Harris come into his own in the role of both inspirational leader and uncompromising tackler. With Leeds having taken a 2\u20131 lead at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] with just six minutes remaining, it was his quick [[Indirect free kick|free kick]] which led to [[Ian Hutchinson (footballer born 1948)|Ian Hutchinson]]'s  headed equaliser to take the game to a replay. During the replay at [[Old Trafford]] his late tackle on Leeds' playmaker [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]] after just eight minutes (just one of many late tackles committed by both sides), left the latter a virtual passenger for the rest of the match: Chelsea eventually won 2\u20131 after extra-time.\n\nThe following season saw Harris lift Chelsea's first major [[Europe]]an honour \u2013 the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] \u2013 in another replayed final against [[Real Madrid]] in [[Athens]]. Chelsea also reached a second League Cup final in 1972, but surprisingly lost to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] in what proved to be his last major final for the club.\n\n==Moves==\nWhile many of Chelsea's star players departed during the 1970s ( due to Peter Osgood and Alan Hudson falling out with manager Dave Sexton, and due to the financial crisis caused by the building of the new East Stand, and the financial impact of relegation )  Harris remained ever-present in the side throughout a decade which saw them relegated twice and promoted once, although he was replaced as Club Captain by [[John Hollins]] at the tail end of the 1971/72 season. Harris was primarily a central defender in the mould of Bobby Moore and Norman Hunter but in later years he was often played out of position as circumstances dictated. After the retirement of Eddie McCreadie he played at left back for a considerable time and was used as cover at right back when injuries left the financially struggling Chelsea short of cover. In the closing stages of his career he also played as a holding midfield player in a role similar to Claude Makelele, providing a screen for a defence that was often caught out by counter-attacks. Over an 18-year period Harris was rarely out of the first team. In 10 seasons he averaged 41 league games out of 42 and in 5 other seasons he averaged over 37 games. He finally left Chelsea in 1980 to become a player-coach at [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]], having played a record 795 games for Chelsea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bounder.friardale.co.uk/Appearances/He-Ho.htm |title=Players Appearances He-Ho |publisher=Bounder.friardale.co.uk |date= |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref> He later had a brief stint as player-manager of [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]].\n\n==In retirement==\nHarris was a professional greyhound trainer for several years during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barnes/Sellers|first=Julia/John|title=Ladbrokes Greyhound Fact File|year=1992|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-22-8}}</ref> He is now a football [[pundit (politics)|pundit]] (especially on Chelsea), an in-demand after-dinner speaker and has written an [[autobiography]], ''Chopper: A Chelsea Legend''. He also has a suite named after him at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].\n\nOn 13 November 2007, he took part in the limited edition autobiography CD series ''60 minutes with...'', when he was interviewed by David Knight.

With the beginning of [[Hip Hop Galsen]] and the creation of Pee Froiss (with Xuman Gunman and Kool Kocc 6), Gee Bayss really starts a career as hip hop DJ, training himself to the art of turntablism.
