In first book of the Pentateuch, the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Israelites]] had come to live in Egypt in the [[Land of Goshen]] during a famine due to the fact that an Israelite, [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]], had become a high official in the court of the [[pharaoh]]. Exodus begins with the deaths of Joseph and the ascension of a new pharaoh \"who did not know Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8). The pharaoh becomes concerned by the number and strength of Israelites in Egypt and enslaves them, commanding them to build at two \"supply cities\" called [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Rameses]] (Exodus 1:11).{{efn|The [[Septuagint]] version includes a reference to a third \"supply city\": \" On,  which  is  [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]\" (LXX Exodus 1:11, trans. Larry J. Perkins).}} The pharaoh also orders the slaughter at birth of all male Hebrew children. One Hebrew child, however, is rescued by being placed in a basket on the [[Nile]]. He is found and adopted by [[Pharaoh's daughter (Exodus)|Pharaoh's daughter]], who names him [[Moses]]. Moses eventually kills an Egyptian he sees beating a Hebrew slave, and is forced to flee to [[Midian]], marrying a daughter of the Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. The old pharaoh dies and a new one ascends to the throne.\n\nMoses, in Midian, goes to [[Mount Horeb]], where [[Yahweh]] appears in a [[Burning Bush]] and commands him to go to Egypt to free the Hebrew slaves and bring them to the [[promised land]] in [[Canaan]]. Yahweh also speaks to Moses's brother [[Aaron]]; they both assemble the Israelites and perform signs so that they believe in Yahweh's promise. Moses and Aaron then go to the Pharaoh and ask him to let the Israelites go into the desert for a religious festival, but the Pharaoh refuses and commands the Israelites to make [[bricks without straw]] and increases their workload. Moses and Aaron return to the Pharaoh and this time ask him to free the Israelites. The Pharaoh demands for Moses to perform a [[miracle]], and Aaron throws down [[Staff of Moses|Moses' staff]], which turns into a snake; however, the Pharaoh's magicians{{efn|These magicians are referred to in the Hebrew text as {{lang|he|\u1e25artumm\u00eem|italics=yes}}, which derives from [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] {{lang|egy|\u1e25rj-tp|italic=yes}} ([[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] {{lang|egy|p-hritob|italics=yes}}, {{lang-akk|\u1e25ar-tibi|italic=yes}}) a title meaning \"chief\" and shortened from \"chief lector priest\".{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=139}} The Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate Moses and Aaron's actions until the third plague (gnats), when they are the first to recognize that a divine power is at work (Exodus 8:19). In plague four (festering boils), they themselves are afflicted and no longer contest with Moses and Aaron.{{sfn|Assmann|2018|pp=139-142}}}} are also able to do this, though Moses' staff devours the others. The Pharaoh then refuses to let the Israelites go.\n\n[[File:Israel's Escape from Egypt.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Exodus from Egypt by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]\nAfter this, Yahweh begins inflicting the [[Plagues of Egypt]] on the Egyptians for each time that Moses goes to Pharaoh and Pharaoh refuses to release the Israelites. Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate the first plagues, in which Yahweh turns the Nile to blood and produces a plague of frogs, but are unable to reproduce any plagues after the third, the plague of gnats. After each plague Pharaoh allows the Israelites to worship Yahweh to remove the plague, then refuses to free them. In the final plague, Yahweh kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, but the Israelites, who have been commanded to kill one lamb per family and smear its blood on their doorposts, are spared. Yahweh commands that the Israelites observe a festival as \"a perpetual ordinance\" to remember this event (Exodus 12:14). Pharaoh finally agrees to let the Israelites go after his firstborn son is killed. Yahweh leads the Israelites in the form of a [[pillar of cloud]] in the day and a [[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] at night. However, once the Israelites have already left, Pharaoh changes his mind and pursues the Israelites to the shore of the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses his staff to [[parting of the Red Sea|part the Red Sea]], and the Israelites cross on dry ground, but the sea closes down on the pursuing Egyptians, drowning them all.\n\nThe Israelites now begin to complain about Aaron and Moses, as Yahweh miraculously provided them first with water and food, eventually raining [[manna]] down for them to eat. [[Amalek]] attacks at [[Rephidim]] but is defeated in battle. Jethro comes to Moses with Moses's wife and sons; on Jethro's advice, Moses appoints judges for the tribes of Israel. The Israelites reach the [[Sinai Desert]] and Yahweh calls Moses to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], where [[Yahweh]] reveals himself to his people and establishes the [[Ten Commandments]] and [[Mosaic covenant]]: the Israelites are to keep his ''torah'' (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will give them the land of Canaan. Yahweh establishes the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] and various rules for ritual worship, among other laws. However, in Moses's absence the Israelites sin against Yahweh by creating the idol of a [[golden calf]], and as retaliation Yahweh has the [[Levites]] kill three thousand people (Exodus 32:28) and Yahweh sends a plague on the Israelites. The Israelites now accept the covenant, build a [[tabernacle]] for Yahweh, and receive their laws. Yahweh commands Moses to take a [[census]] of the Israelites and establishes the duties of the Levites. Then the Israelites depart from Mount Sinai.\n\nYahweh commands Moses to send [[The Twelve Spies|twelve spies]] ahead to Canaan to scout the land. The spies discover that the Canaanites are strong, and, believing that the Israelites cannot defeat them, the spies falsely report to the Israelites that Canaan is full of giants so that the Israelites will not invade (Numbers 13:31-33). The Israelites refuse to go to Canaan, so Yahweh manifests himself and declares that the generation that left Egypt will have to pass away before the Israelites can enter Canaan. The Israelites will have to remain in the wilderness for forty years, and Yahweh kills the spies through a plague except for the righteous [[Joshua]] and [[Caleb]], who will be allowed to enter the promised land. A group of Israelites led by [[Korah]], son of Izhar, rebels against Moses, but Yahweh opens the earth and sends them living to [[Sheol]].\n\nThe Israelites come to the oasis of [[Kadesh Barnea]], where [[Miriam]] dies. The people are without water, so Yahweh commands Moses to get water from a rock by speaking to it, but Moses strikes the rock with his staff instead, for which Yahweh forbids him from entering the promised land. Moses sends a messenger to the king of [[Edom]] requesting passage through his land to Canaan, but the king refuses. The Israelites then go to [[Mount Hor]], where Aaron dies. The Israelites try to go around Edom, but the Israelites complain about lack of bread and water, so Yahweh sends a plague of poisonous snakes to afflict them. After Moses prays for deliverance, Yahweh has him create the [[brazen serpent]], and the Israelites who look at it are cured. The Israelites are soon in conflict with various other kingdoms, and king [[Balak]] of [[Moab]] attempts to have the seer [[Balaam]] curse the Israelites, but Balaam blesses the Israelites instead. Some Israelites begin having sexual relations with Moabite women and [[Heresy of Peor|worshipping Moabite gods]], so Yahweh orders Moses to [[impalement|impale]] the idolators and sends a plague, but the full extent of Yahweh's wrath is averted when [[Phinehas]] impales an Israelite and a Midianite woman having intercourse (Numbers 25:7-9). Yahweh commands the Israelites to destroy the Midianites and Moses and Phinehas take another census. They then conquer the lands of [[Og]] and [[Sihon]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], settling the [[Gadites]], [[Reubenites]], and half the [[Tribe of Manasseh]] there.\n\nMoses then addresses the Israelites for a final time on the banks of the [[Jordan River]], reviewing their travels and giving them further laws. Yahweh tells Moses to summon Joshua, whom Yahweh commissions to lead the conquest of Canaan. Yahweh tells Moses to ascend [[Mount Nebo]], from where he sees the promised land and where he dies.\n\n===Covenant and law===\nThe climax of the Exodus is the covenant (binding legal agreement) between God and Israel mediated by Moses at Sinai: Yahweh will protect Israel as his chosen people for all time, and  Israel will keep Yahweh's laws and worship only him.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The covenant is described in stages: at Exodus 24:3\u20138 the Israelites agree to abide by the \"book of the covenant\" that Moses has just read to them; shortly afterwards God writes the \"words of the covenant\" \u2013 the [[Ten Commandments]] \u2013 on stone tablets; and finally, as the people gather in Moab to cross into Canaan, the land God has promised them, Moses makes a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel \"beside the covenant he made with them at Horeb\" (Deuteronomy 29:1).{{sfn|McKenzie|2000|p=4\u20135}} The laws are set out in a number of codes:{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=146}}\n* [[Ethical Decalogue]] (i.e., the Ten Commandments), Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5;\n* The [[Covenant Code|Book of the Covenant]], Exodus 20:22\u201323:3;\n* [[Ritual Decalogue]], Exodus 34;\n* The ritual laws of [[Leviticus]] 1\u20136 and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1\u201310;\n* The [[Holiness Code]], Leviticus 17\u201326;\n* Deuteronomic Code, [[Deuteronomy]] 12\u201326.\n\n==Development and final composition==\n[[File:109.Ezra Reads the Law to the People.jpg|thumb|''Ezra Reads the Law to the People'' ([[Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for ''La Grande Bible de Tours'']], 1866)]]\nThe earliest traces of the traditions behind the exodus appear in the northern prophets [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (possibly) and [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] (certainly), both active in the 8th century BCE in  northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], but their southern contemporaries [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and [[Book of Micah|Micah]] show no knowledge of an exodus.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}} (Micah 6:45 contains a reference to the exodus, which many scholars take to be an addition by a later editor.){{efn|Micah 6:45 (\"I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.

Weinberg and called the \"Citizen-Temple Community\", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=226\u2013227}} The books containing the Exodus story served as an \"identity card\" defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=225}}\n\n== Origins and historicity ==\n{{See also|Sources and parallels of the Exodus|Historicity of the Bible}}\nThere are two main positions on the historicity of the Exodus in modern scholarship.{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}} The majority position is that the biblical Exodus narrative has some ultimate historicity, although there is little of historical worth in the biblical narrative.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}}{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} The other main position, often associated with the school of [[Biblical minimalism]],{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=23-24}} is that the Exodus has no historical basis. Both positions are in agreement that the biblical Exodus narrative is best understood as a [[founding myth]] of the Jewish people, explaining their origins and providing an ideological foundation for their culture and institutions, not an accurate depiction of the history of the Israelites.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=46}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} A third position, that the biblical narrative is essentially correct (\"Biblical maximalism\"), is today held by \"few, if any [...] in mainstream scholarship, only on the more fundamentalist fringes.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}}\n\nMainstream scholarship no longer accepts the biblical Exodus account as accurate history for a number of reasons. No modern attempt to identify a historical Egyptian prototype for Moses has found wide acceptance, and no period in Egyptian history matches the Biblical accounts of the Exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=63-64}} Some elements of the story are clearly meant to be [[Miracle|miraculous]] and defy rational explanation, such as the [[Plagues of Egypt]] and the [[Crossing of the Red Sea]].{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=15-17}} Lester Grabbe argues that \"attempts to find naturalistic explanations [for these events] [...] miss the point: the aim of the narrative is to magnify the power of Yhwh and Moses.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=93}} The Bible also fails to mention the names of any of the Pharaohs involved in the Exodus narrative.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=69}} While [[ancientEgypt|ancient Egyptian]] texts from the [[New Kingdom]] mention \"Asiatics\" living in Egypt as slaves and workers, these people cannot be securely connected to the Israelites, and no contemporary Egyptian text mentions a large-scale exodus of slaves like that described in the Bible.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|pp=2-3}} The earliest surviving historical mention of the Israelites, the Egyptian [[Merneptah Stele]] (c. 1207 BCE), appears to place them in or around Canaan and gives no indication of any exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=65-67}} The numbers of people involved in the Exodus as given in the Bible are fanciful, as the [[Sinai Desert]] could never have supported the 603,550 Israelites mentioned in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1:46.{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=18-19}} Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion \u2013 that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible \u2013 seems irrefutable [...] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence.\"{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=63}} Instead, modern archaeology suggests continuity between Canaanite and Israelite settlement, indicating a primarily Canaanite origin for Israel.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=4}}{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}}\n\nA majority of scholars nevertheless still believes that the Exodus has some historical basis,{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}} with Kenton Sparks referring to it as \"mythologized history.\"{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} Evidence in favor of historical traditions forming a background to the Exodus myth include the documented movements of small groups of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] into and out of Egypt during the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] and [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasties]], some elements of Egyptian [[folklore]] and culture in the Exodus narrative,{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=8-10}} and the names Moses, Aaron and Phinehas, which seem to have an Egyptian origin.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=65}} The expulsion of the [[Hyksos]], a Semitic group that had conquered much of Egypt, by the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt]] is frequently discussed as a potential historical parallel or origin for the story.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=78}}{{sfn|Redford|1992|pp=412\u2013413}} Avraham Faust and William Dever argue that a group of Egyptian origin, whom Dever cautiously identifies as \"the house of Joseph\",{{sfn|Dever|2003|p=231}} may have joined the Israelites after their initial [[ethnogenesis|formation]] in Canaan, and that their story could have become adopted as the national myth of the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=229\u2013231}}  It is also possible that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the late second millennium BCE may have aided the adoption of the story of a small group of Egyptian refugees by the native Canaanites among the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}} Most proposals for a historical Exodus of any sort place it in the sixteenth, fifteenth, or thirteenth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=77}} Alternatively, Nadav Na'aman argues that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the Nineteenth and especially the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] may have inspired the Exodus narrative, forming a \"[[collective memory]]\" of Egyptian oppression that was transferred from Canaan to Egypt itself in the popular consciousness.{{sfn|Na'aman|2011|pp=62-69}}\n\nSome scholars, including the biblical minimalists, show more skepticism toward ascribing any [[historicity]] at all to the exodus,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=95}}\nwith some arguing that the myth has its origins in the [[Babylonian exile|exilic]] and post-exilic Jewish community and has little to no historical basis.{{sfn|Russell|2009|pp=11-14}} Lester Grabbe, for instance, argues that \"[t]here is no compelling reason that the exodus has to be rooted in history,\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=84}} and that the details of the story more closely fit the seventh through the fifth centuries BCE than the traditional dating to the second millennium BCE.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=85}} Rejecting the traditional view that the Exodus records pre-exilic traditions, Philip R. Davies suggests that the story may have been inspired by the return to Israel of Israelites and Judaeans who were placed in Egypt as garrison troops by the [[Assyria]]ns in the fifth and sixth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=105}} Historian Graham Davies has criticized minimalist scholars for relying too heavily on archaeology, stating \"a historian cannot simply ignore the textual evidence (both biblical and non-biblical) that is relevant to an issue, and in this case the textual evidence purports, at least, to give a different view from that which archaeologists now tend to favor (or most of them, anyway).\"{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=25}}\n\n==Cultural significance==\n[[File:A Seder table setting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Seder table setting, commemorating the Passover and Exodus]]\nThe Exodus is invoked daily in [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Jewish prayers]] and celebrated each year at the feasts of [[Pesach]] (Passover) and [[Shavuot]], the two being known respectively as \"the time of our freedom\" and \"the time our Torah was given\".{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The two are closely linked, with Pesach announcing that the freedom it introduces is only fully realised with the giving of the law (the Torah).{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} A third Jewish festival, [[Sukkot]], the Festival of Booths, is associated with the Israelites living in booths after they left their previous homes in Egypt.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The festivals now associated with the Exodus (Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot) began as agricultural and seasonal feasts but became completely subsumed into the central Exodus myth of Israel's deliverance from oppression at the hands of God.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The fringes worn at the corners of traditional Jewish prayer shawls are described as a physical reminder of the obligation to observe the laws given at the climax of Exodus: \"Look at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord\" (Numbers).{{sfn|Sarason|2015|p=53}}\n\nA number of historical events and situations have been compared to the Exodus. Many early American settlers interpreted their flight from Europe to a new life in America as a new exodus. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] recommended for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to depict Moses leading the Israelites across the Red Sea. African Americans suffering under slavery and racial oppression interpreted their situation in terms of the Exodus, making it a catalyst for social change.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=107}}{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=335}}{{sfn|Coomber|2012|p=123}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible|Judaism}}\n* [[Book of Joshua]], the continuation of the narrative in the conquest of Canaan\n* [[Ipuwer Papyrus]]\n* [[List of films based on the Bible#Moses (Exodus-Deuteronomy)|List of films related to the Exodus]]\n* [[Stations of the Exodus]]\n* [[Va'eira]], [[Bo (parsha)]], and [[Beshalach]]: [[parsha|Torah portions (''parashot'')]] telling the Exodus story\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last1          = Anderson\n| first1         = Bradford A.\n| last2          = Gooder\n| first2         = Paula\n| author-link2   = Paula Gooder\n| title          = An Introduction to the Study of the Pentateuch\n| year           = 2017\n| publisher      = Bloomsbury \n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=ebXFDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT135&dq=%22how+then+to+explain+the+emergence+of+the+exodus+tradition#v=onepage&q=%22how%20then%20to%20explain%20the%20emergence%20of%20the%20exodus%20tradition%3F%22&f=false\n| isbn           = 9780567656407\n| ref            = harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = The Invention of Religion: Faith and Covenant in the Book of Exodus\n| publisher      = Princeton University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=K7s7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| year           = 2018\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9781400889235\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt\n| publisher      = Harvard University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/books?id=IjUiie30Z9cC&pg=PA34\n| year           = 2009\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9780674020306\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|first=Jan \n|last=Assmann\n|title=From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsjmCwAAQBAJ\n|year=2014\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|isbn=978-977-416-631-0\n|ref=harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Bandstra\n| first          = Barry L.\n| title          = Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n| year           = 2008\n| publisher      = Cengage Learning\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn           = 978-0495391050\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Barmash\n| first          = Pamela\n| chapter        = Introduction: The Exodus: Central, Learning, and Generative\n| editor1-last   = Barmash\n| editor1-first  = Pamela\n| editor2-last   = Nelson\n| editor2-first  = W.

The covenant's terms are that Yahweh will protect his [[chosen people]], as long as they will keep his laws and exclusively worship him.{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}}{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The Exodus and its laws remain central to [[Judaism]], recounted daily in [[Jewish prayers]] and celebrated in festivals such as [[Passover]], as well as resonating with non-Jewish groups, from early American settlers fleeing persecution in Europe to [[African Americans]] striving for freedom and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]].{{sfn|Berlin|Brettler|2004}} [[Jan Assmann]] refers to it as possibly \"the most grandiose and influential story ever told.\"{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=1}}\n\nThe consensus of modern scholars is that the Bible does not give an accurate account of the origins of Israel, which formed as an entity in the central highlands of [[Canaan]] in the late second millennium BCE from the indigenous [[Canaanites|Canaanite]] culture.{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}}{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=6\u20137}}{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}} Most scholars believe that the story of the Exodus has some historical basis, but that any such basis has little resemblance to the story told in the Bible.{{sfn|Faust|2015|page=476}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}} There is a widespread agreement that the composition of the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch, the biblical books which contain the Exodus narrative, took place in the [[Yehud Medinata|Middle Persian Period]] (5th century BCE),{{sfn|Romer|2008|p=2}} although the traditions behind it are older and can be found in the writings of the 8th-century BCE [[prophet]]s.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=63}}\n\n==Biblical narrative==\n===Narrative===\n[[File:1867 Edward Poynter - Israel in Egypt.jpg|thumb|400px|''Israel in Egypt'' ([[Edward Poynter]], 1867)]]\nThe story of the Exodus is told in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Deuteronomy]], the last four of the first five books of the bible (also called the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch). In first book of the Pentateuch, the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Israelites]] had come to live in Egypt in the [[Land of Goshen]] during a famine due to the fact that an Israelite, [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]], had become a high official in the court of the [[pharaoh]]. Exodus begins with the deaths of Joseph and the ascension of a new pharaoh \"who did not know Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8). The pharaoh becomes concerned by the number and strength of Israelites in Egypt and enslaves them, commanding them to build at two \"supply cities\" called [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Rameses]] (Exodus 1:11).{{efn|The [[Septuagint]] version includes a reference to a third \"supply city\": \" On,  which  is  [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]\" (LXX Exodus 1:11, trans. Larry J. Perkins).}} The pharaoh also orders the slaughter at birth of all male Hebrew children. One Hebrew child, however, is rescued by being placed in a basket on the [[Nile]]. He is found and adopted by [[Pharaoh's daughter (Exodus)|Pharaoh's daughter]], who names him [[Moses]]. Moses eventually kills an Egyptian he sees beating a Hebrew slave, and is forced to flee to [[Midian]], marrying a daughter of the Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. The old pharaoh dies and a new one ascends to the throne.\n\nMoses, in Midian, goes to [[Mount Horeb]], where [[Yahweh]] appears in a [[Burning Bush]] and commands him to go to Egypt to free the Hebrew slaves and bring them to the [[promised land]] in [[Canaan]]. Yahweh also speaks to Moses's brother [[Aaron]]; they both assemble the Israelites and perform signs so that they believe in Yahweh's promise. Moses and Aaron then go to the Pharaoh and ask him to let the Israelites go into the desert for a religious festival, but the Pharaoh refuses and commands the Israelites to make [[bricks without straw]] and increases their workload. Moses and Aaron return to the Pharaoh and this time ask him to free the Israelites. The Pharaoh demands for Moses to perform a [[miracle]], and Aaron throws down [[Staff of Moses|Moses' staff]], which turns into a snake; however, the Pharaoh's magicians{{efn|These magicians are referred to in the Hebrew text as {{lang|he|\u1e25artumm\u00eem|italics=yes}}, which derives from [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] {{lang|egy|\u1e25rj-tp|italic=yes}} ([[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] {{lang|egy|p-hritob|italics=yes}}, {{lang-akk|\u1e25ar-tibi|italic=yes}}) a title meaning \"chief\" and shortened from \"chief lector priest\".{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=139}} The Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate Moses and Aaron's actions until the third plague (gnats), when they are the first to recognize that a divine power is at work (Exodus 8:19). In plague four (festering boils), they themselves are afflicted and no longer contest with Moses and Aaron.{{sfn|Assmann|2018|pp=139-142}}}} are also able to do this, though Moses' staff devours the others. The Pharaoh then refuses to let the Israelites go.\n\n[[File:Israel's Escape from Egypt.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Exodus from Egypt by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]\nAfter this, Yahweh begins inflicting the [[Plagues of Egypt]] on the Egyptians for each time that Moses goes to Pharaoh and Pharaoh refuses to release the Israelites. Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate the first plagues, in which Yahweh turns the Nile to blood and produces a plague of frogs, but are unable to reproduce any plagues after the third, the plague of gnats. After each plague Pharaoh allows the Israelites to worship Yahweh to remove the plague, then refuses to free them. In the final plague, Yahweh kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, but the Israelites, who have been commanded to kill one lamb per family and smear its blood on their doorposts, are spared. Yahweh commands that the Israelites observe a festival as \"a perpetual ordinance\" to remember this event (Exodus 12:14). Pharaoh finally agrees to let the Israelites go after his firstborn son is killed. Yahweh leads the Israelites in the form of a [[pillar of cloud]] in the day and a [[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] at night. However, once the Israelites have already left, Pharaoh changes his mind and pursues the Israelites to the shore of the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses his staff to [[parting of the Red Sea|part the Red Sea]], and the Israelites cross on dry ground, but the sea closes down on the pursuing Egyptians, drowning them all.\n\nThe Israelites now begin to complain about Aaron and Moses, as Yahweh miraculously provided them first with water and food, eventually raining [[manna]] down for them to eat. [[Amalek]] attacks at [[Rephidim]] but is defeated in battle. Jethro comes to Moses with Moses's wife and sons; on Jethro's advice, Moses appoints judges for the tribes of Israel. The Israelites reach the [[Sinai Desert]] and Yahweh calls Moses to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], where [[Yahweh]] reveals himself to his people and establishes the [[Ten Commandments]] and [[Mosaic covenant]]: the Israelites are to keep his ''torah'' (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will give them the land of Canaan. Yahweh establishes the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] and various rules for ritual worship, among other laws. However, in Moses's absence the Israelites sin against Yahweh by creating the idol of a [[golden calf]], and as retaliation Yahweh has the [[Levites]] kill three thousand people (Exodus 32:28) and Yahweh sends a plague on the Israelites. The Israelites now accept the covenant, build a [[tabernacle]] for Yahweh, and receive their laws. Yahweh commands Moses to take a [[census]] of the Israelites and establishes the duties of the Levites. Then the Israelites depart from Mount Sinai.\n\nYahweh commands Moses to send [[The Twelve Spies|twelve spies]] ahead to Canaan to scout the land. The spies discover that the Canaanites are strong, and, believing that the Israelites cannot defeat them, the spies falsely report to the Israelites that Canaan is full of giants so that the Israelites will not invade (Numbers 13:31-33). The Israelites refuse to go to Canaan, so Yahweh manifests himself and declares that the generation that left Egypt will have to pass away before the Israelites can enter Canaan. The Israelites will have to remain in the wilderness for forty years, and Yahweh kills the spies through a plague except for the righteous [[Joshua]] and [[Caleb]], who will be allowed to enter the promised land. A group of Israelites led by [[Korah]], son of Izhar, rebels against Moses, but Yahweh opens the earth and sends them living to [[Sheol]].\n\nThe Israelites come to the oasis of [[Kadesh Barnea]], where [[Miriam]] dies. The people are without water, so Yahweh commands Moses to get water from a rock by speaking to it, but Moses strikes the rock with his staff instead, for which Yahweh forbids him from entering the promised land. Moses sends a messenger to the king of [[Edom]] requesting passage through his land to Canaan, but the king refuses. The Israelites then go to [[Mount Hor]], where Aaron dies. The Israelites try to go around Edom, but the Israelites complain about lack of bread and water, so Yahweh sends a plague of poisonous snakes to afflict them. After Moses prays for deliverance, Yahweh has him create the [[brazen serpent]], and the Israelites who look at it are cured. The Israelites are soon in conflict with various other kingdoms, and king [[Balak]] of [[Moab]] attempts to have the seer [[Balaam]] curse the Israelites, but Balaam blesses the Israelites instead. Some Israelites begin having sexual relations with Moabite women and [[Heresy of Peor|worshipping Moabite gods]], so Yahweh orders Moses to [[impalement|impale]] the idolators and sends a plague, but the full extent of Yahweh's wrath is averted when [[Phinehas]] impales an Israelite and a Midianite woman having intercourse (Numbers 25:7-9). Yahweh commands the Israelites to destroy the Midianites and Moses and Phinehas take another census. They then conquer the lands of [[Og]] and [[Sihon]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], settling the [[Gadites]], [[Reubenites]], and half the [[Tribe of Manasseh]] there.\n\nMoses then addresses the Israelites for a final time on the banks of the [[Jordan River]], reviewing their travels and giving them further laws. Yahweh tells Moses to summon Joshua, whom Yahweh commissions to lead the conquest of Canaan. Yahweh tells Moses to ascend [[Mount Nebo]], from where he sees the promised land and where he dies.\n\n===Covenant and law===\nThe climax of the Exodus is the covenant (binding legal agreement) between God and Israel mediated by Moses at Sinai: Yahweh will protect Israel as his chosen people for all time, and  Israel will keep Yahweh's laws and worship only him.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The covenant is described in stages: at Exodus 24:3\u20138 the Israelites agree to abide by the \"book of the covenant\" that Moses has just read to them; shortly afterwards God writes the \"words of the covenant\" \u2013 the [[Ten Commandments]] \u2013 on stone tablets; and finally, as the people gather in Moab to cross into Canaan, the land God has promised them, Moses makes a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel \"beside the covenant he made with them at Horeb\" (Deuteronomy 29:1).{{sfn|McKenzie|2000|p=4\u20135}} The laws are set out in a number of codes:{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=146}}\n* [[Ethical Decalogue]] (i.e., the Ten Commandments), Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5;\n* The [[Covenant Code|Book of the Covenant]], Exodus 20:22\u201323:3;\n* [[Ritual Decalogue]], Exodus 34;\n* The ritual laws of [[Leviticus]] 1\u20136 and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1\u201310;\n* The [[Holiness Code]], Leviticus 17\u201326;\n* Deuteronomic Code, [[Deuteronomy]] 12\u201326.\n\n==Development and final composition==\n[[File:109.Ezra Reads the Law to the People.jpg|thumb|''Ezra Reads the Law to the People'' ([[Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for ''La Grande Bible de Tours'']], 1866)]]\nThe earliest traces of the traditions behind the exodus appear in the northern prophets [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (possibly) and [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] (certainly), both active in the 8th century BCE in  northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], but their southern contemporaries [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and [[Book of Micah|Micah]] show no knowledge of an exodus.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}} (Micah 6:45 contains a reference to the exodus, which many scholars take to be an addition by a later editor.){{efn|Micah 6:45 (\"I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.

Weinberg and called the \"Citizen-Temple Community\", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=226\u2013227}} The books containing the Exodus story served as an \"identity card\" defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=225}}\n\n== Origins and historicity ==\n{{See also|Sources and parallels of the Exodus|Historicity of the Bible}}\nThere are two main positions on the historicity of the Exodus in modern scholarship.{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}} The majority position is that the biblical Exodus narrative has some ultimate historicity, although there is little of historical worth in the biblical narrative.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}}{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} The other main position, often associated with the school of [[Biblical minimalism]],{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=23-24}} is that the Exodus has no historical basis. Both positions are in agreement that the biblical Exodus narrative is best understood as a [[founding myth]] of the Jewish people, explaining their origins and providing an ideological foundation for their culture and institutions, not an accurate depiction of the history of the Israelites.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=46}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} A third position, that the biblical narrative is essentially correct (\"Biblical maximalism\"), is today held by \"few, if any [...] in mainstream scholarship, only on the more fundamentalist fringes.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}}\n\nMainstream scholarship no longer accepts the biblical Exodus account as accurate history for a number of reasons. No modern attempt to identify a historical Egyptian prototype for Moses has found wide acceptance, and no period in Egyptian history matches the Biblical accounts of the Exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=63-64}} Some elements of the story are clearly meant to be [[Miracle|miraculous]] and defy rational explanation, such as the [[Plagues of Egypt]] and the [[Crossing of the Red Sea]].{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=15-17}} Lester Grabbe argues that \"attempts to find naturalistic explanations [for these events] [...] miss the point: the aim of the narrative is to magnify the power of Yhwh and Moses.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=93}} The Bible also fails to mention the names of any of the Pharaohs involved in the Exodus narrative.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=69}} While [[ancientEgypt|ancient Egyptian]] texts from the [[New Kingdom]] mention \"Asiatics\" living in Egypt as slaves and workers, these people cannot be securely connected to the Israelites, and no contemporary Egyptian text mentions a large-scale exodus of slaves like that described in the Bible.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|pp=2-3}} The earliest surviving historical mention of the Israelites, the Egyptian [[Merneptah Stele]] (c. 1207 BCE), appears to place them in or around Canaan and gives no indication of any exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=65-67}} The numbers of people involved in the Exodus as given in the Bible are fanciful, as the [[Sinai Desert]] could never have supported the 603,550 Israelites mentioned in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1:46.{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=18-19}} Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion \u2013 that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible \u2013 seems irrefutable [...] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence.\"{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=63}} Instead, modern archaeology suggests continuity between Canaanite and Israelite settlement, indicating a primarily Canaanite origin for Israel.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=4}}{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}}\n\nA majority of scholars nevertheless still believes that the Exodus has some historical basis,{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}} with Kenton Sparks referring to it as \"mythologized history.\"{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} Evidence in favor of historical traditions forming a background to the Exodus myth include the documented movements of small groups of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] into and out of Egypt during the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] and [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasties]], some elements of Egyptian [[folklore]] and culture in the Exodus narrative,{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=8-10}} and the names Moses, Aaron and Phinehas, which seem to have an Egyptian origin.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=65}} The expulsion of the [[Hyksos]], a Semitic group that had conquered much of Egypt, by the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt]] is frequently discussed as a potential historical parallel or origin for the story.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=78}}{{sfn|Redford|1992|pp=412\u2013413}} Avraham Faust and William Dever argue that a group of Egyptian origin, whom Dever cautiously identifies as \"the house of Joseph\",{{sfn|Dever|2003|p=231}} may have joined the Israelites after their initial [[ethnogenesis|formation]] in Canaan, and that their story could have become adopted as the national myth of the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=229\u2013231}}  It is also possible that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the late second millennium BCE may have aided the adoption of the story of a small group of Egyptian refugees by the native Canaanites among the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}} Most proposals for a historical Exodus of any sort place it in the sixteenth, fifteenth, or thirteenth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=77}} Alternatively, Nadav Na'aman argues that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the Nineteenth and especially the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] may have inspired the Exodus narrative, forming a \"[[collective memory]]\" of Egyptian oppression that was transferred from Canaan to Egypt itself in the popular consciousness.{{sfn|Na'aman|2011|pp=62-69}}\n\nSome scholars, including the biblical minimalists, show more skepticism toward ascribing any [[historicity]] at all to the exodus,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=95}}\nwith some arguing that the myth has its origins in the [[Babylonian exile|exilic]] and post-exilic Jewish community and has little to no historical basis.{{sfn|Russell|2009|pp=11-14}} Lester Grabbe, for instance, argues that \"[t]here is no compelling reason that the exodus has to be rooted in history,\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=84}} and that the details of the story more closely fit the seventh through the fifth centuries BCE than the traditional dating to the second millennium BCE.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=85}} Rejecting the traditional view that the Exodus records pre-exilic traditions, Philip R. Davies suggests that the story may have been inspired by the return to Israel of Israelites and Judaeans who were placed in Egypt as garrison troops by the [[Assyria]]ns in the fifth and sixth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=105}} Historian Graham Davies has criticized minimalist scholars for relying too heavily on archaeology, stating \"a historian cannot simply ignore the textual evidence (both biblical and non-biblical) that is relevant to an issue, and in this case the textual evidence purports, at least, to give a different view from that which archaeologists now tend to favor (or most of them, anyway).\"{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=25}}\n\n==Cultural significance==\n[[File:A Seder table setting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Seder table setting, commemorating the Passover and Exodus]]\nThe Exodus is invoked daily in [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Jewish prayers]] and celebrated each year at the feasts of [[Pesach]] (Passover) and [[Shavuot]], the two being known respectively as \"the time of our freedom\" and \"the time our Torah was given\".{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The two are closely linked, with Pesach announcing that the freedom it introduces is only fully realised with the giving of the law (the Torah).{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} A third Jewish festival, [[Sukkot]], the Festival of Booths, is associated with the Israelites living in booths after they left their previous homes in Egypt.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The festivals now associated with the Exodus (Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot) began as agricultural and seasonal feasts but became completely subsumed into the central Exodus myth of Israel's deliverance from oppression at the hands of God.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The fringes worn at the corners of traditional Jewish prayer shawls are described as a physical reminder of the obligation to observe the laws given at the climax of Exodus: \"Look at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord\" (Numbers).{{sfn|Sarason|2015|p=53}}\n\nA number of historical events and situations have been compared to the Exodus. Many early American settlers interpreted their flight from Europe to a new life in America as a new exodus. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] recommended for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to depict Moses leading the Israelites across the Red Sea. African Americans suffering under slavery and racial oppression interpreted their situation in terms of the Exodus, making it a catalyst for social change.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=107}}{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=335}}{{sfn|Coomber|2012|p=123}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible|Judaism}}\n* [[Book of Joshua]], the continuation of the narrative in the conquest of Canaan\n* [[Ipuwer Papyrus]]\n* [[List of films based on the Bible#Moses (Exodus-Deuteronomy)|List of films related to the Exodus]]\n* [[Stations of the Exodus]]\n* [[Va'eira]], [[Bo (parsha)]], and [[Beshalach]]: [[parsha|Torah portions (''parashot'')]] telling the Exodus story\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last1          = Anderson\n| first1         = Bradford A.\n| last2          = Gooder\n| first2         = Paula\n| author-link2   = Paula Gooder\n| title          = An Introduction to the Study of the Pentateuch\n| year           = 2017\n| publisher      = Bloomsbury \n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=ebXFDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT135&dq=%22how+then+to+explain+the+emergence+of+the+exodus+tradition#v=onepage&q=%22how%20then%20to%20explain%20the%20emergence%20of%20the%20exodus%20tradition%3F%22&f=false\n| isbn           = 9780567656407\n| ref            = harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = The Invention of Religion: Faith and Covenant in the Book of Exodus\n| publisher      = Princeton University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=K7s7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| year           = 2018\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9781400889235\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt\n| publisher      = Harvard University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/books?id=IjUiie30Z9cC&pg=PA34\n| year           = 2009\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9780674020306\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|first=Jan \n|last=Assmann\n|title=From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsjmCwAAQBAJ\n|year=2014\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|isbn=978-977-416-631-0\n|ref=harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Bandstra\n| first          = Barry L.\n| title          = Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n| year           = 2008\n| publisher      = Cengage Learning\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn           = 978-0495391050\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Barmash\n| first          = Pamela\n| chapter        = Introduction: The Exodus: Central, Learning, and Generative\n| editor1-last   = Barmash\n| editor1-first  = Pamela\n| editor2-last   = Nelson\n| editor2-first  = W.

A large group of stars bound by gravitation is generally called a ''[[star cluster]]'' or ''[[galaxy]]'', although, broadly speaking, they are also star systems. Star systems are not to be confused with [[planetary system]]s, which include planets and similar bodies (such as comets).\n\nA star system of two stars is known as a ''[[binary star]]'', ''binary star system'' or ''physical [[double star]]''. If there are no [[Tidal force|tidal]] effects, no perturbation from other forces, and no [[Mass transfer#Astrophysics|transfer of mass]] from one star to the other, such a system is stable, and both stars will trace out an [[elliptic orbit]] around the [[barycenter]] of the system indefinitely. ''(See [[Two-body problem]])''. Examples of binary systems are [[Sirius]], [[Procyon]] and [[Cygnus X-1]], the last of which probably consists of a star and a [[black hole]].\n \nA '''multiple star system''' consists of three or more [[star]]s that appear from [[Earth]] to be close to one another in the sky. This may result from the stars actually being physically close and [[gravity|gravitationally]] bound to each other, in which case it is a ''physical'' multiple star, or this closeness may be merely apparent, in which case it is an ''optical'' multiple star (meaning that the stars may appear to be close to each other when viewed from planet Earth, as they both seem to occupy the same point in the sky, but in reality, one star may be much farther away from Earth than the other, which is not readily apparent unless one can view them from a different angle). Physical multiple stars are also commonly called ''multiple stars'' or ''multiple star systems''.<ref>p. 16, ''Understanding Variable Stars'', John R.

These are similar to ornamental mobiles hung from the ceiling. Some examples can be seen in the figure to the right. Each level of the diagram illustrates the decomposition of the system into two or more systems with smaller size. Evans calls a diagram ''multiplex'' if there is a node with more than two children, i.e. if the decomposition of some subsystem involves two or more orbits with comparable size. Because, as we have already seen for triple stars, this may be unstable, multiple stars are expected to be ''simplex'', meaning that at each level there are exactly two children.

Subsystems which would appear below this in the mobile diagram will be given numbers with three, four, or more digits. When describing a non-hierarchical system by this method, the same subsystem number will be used more than once; for example, a system with three visual components, A, B, and C, no two of which can be grouped into a subsystem, would have two subsystems numbered 1 denoting the two binaries AB and AC. In this case, if B and C were subsequently resolved into binaries, they would be given the subsystem numbers 12 and 13.<ref>{{cite journal |title=MSC \u2013 a catalogue of physical multiple stars |author=A.

This may result from the stars actually being physically close and [[gravity|gravitationally]] bound to each other, in which case it is a ''physical'' multiple star, or this closeness may be merely apparent, in which case it is an ''optical'' multiple star (meaning that the stars may appear to be close to each other when viewed from planet Earth, as they both seem to occupy the same point in the sky, but in reality, one star may be much farther away from Earth than the other, which is not readily apparent unless one can view them from a different angle).

These are similar to ornamental mobiles hung from the ceiling. Some examples can be seen in the figure to the right. Each level of the diagram illustrates the decomposition of the system into two or more systems with smaller size. Evans calls a diagram ''multiplex'' if there is a node with more than two children, i.e. if the decomposition of some subsystem involves two or more orbits with comparable size. Because, as we have already seen for triple stars, this may be unstable, multiple stars are expected to be ''simplex'', meaning that at each level there are exactly two children. Evans calls the number of levels in the diagram its ''hierarchy''.<ref>pp. 393\u2013394, {{cite journal | last=Evans | first=David S. | date=1968 | title=Stars of Higher Multiplicity | journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=9 | bibcode=1968QJRAS...9..388E | pages=388\u2013400}}</ref>\n* A simplex diagram of hierarchy 1, as in (b), describes a binary system.\n<!--\nIf the stellar masses are different, (as seen in the animations above) then the center of mass two stars would be placed closer to the more massive star.

However, it causes problems when new components are discovered at a level above or intermediate to the existing hierarchy. In this case, part of the hierarchy will shift inwards. Components which are found to be nonexistent, or are later reassigned to a different subsystem, also cause problems.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/wmc/toko_hwds.txt\n |title=On the designation of multiple stars\n |author=A.

Since it contains many visual [[double star]]s, which may be optical rather than physical, this hierarchy may be only apparent. It uses upper-case letters (A, B, ...) for the first level of the hierarchy, lower-case letters (a, b, ...) for the second level, and numbers (1, 2, ...) for the third.

Established by the British in the early 20th century, the company shared profits (85% for Britain, and 15% for Iran), but the company withheld their financial records from the Iranian government. By 1951, Iranians supported [[nationalization]] of the AIOC, and Parliament unanimously agreed to nationalize its holding of, what was at the time, the British Empire's largest company. The British retaliated with an embargo on Iranian oil, which was supported by international oil companies. Over the following months, negotiations over control and compensation for the oil were deadlocked, and Iran's economy deteriorated.\n\nU.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] pressed Britain to moderate its position in the negotiations and to not invade Iran. American policies created a feeling in Iran that the United States was on Mossadeq's side and optimism that the oil dispute would soon be settled with \"a series of innovative proposals to settle\" the dispute, giving Iran \"significant amounts of economic aid\". Mossadeq visited Washington, and the American government made \"frequent statements expressing support for him.\"<ref>Gasiorowski writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p. 273</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the United States honored the British embargo and, without Truman's knowledge, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] station in Tehran had been \"carrying out covert activities\" against [[Mohammad Mosaddegh|Mosaddeq]] and the National Front \"at least since the summer of 1952\".<ref>Gasiorowski writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark J.

Until this point, the Carter Administration was still hoping for normal relationships with Iran, sending its National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.\n\nThe Islamic revolutionaries wished to extradite and execute the ousted Shah, and Carter refused to give him any further support or help return him to power. The Shah, suffering from terminal cancer, requested entry into the United States for treatment. The American embassy in Tehran opposed the request, as they were intent on stabilizing relations between the new interim revolutionary government of Iran and the United States.<ref name=\"autogenerated7\"/> However, President Carter agreed to let the Shah in, after severe pressure from [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and other pro-Shah political figures. Iranians' suspicion that the Shah was actually trying to conspire against the Iranian Revolution grew; thus, this incident was often used by the Iranian revolutionaries to justify their claims that the former monarch was an American puppet, and this led to the storming of the American embassy by radical students allied with the Khomeini faction.<ref name=\"autogenerated7\"/>\n\n=== The hostage crisis ===\n{{Main|Iran hostage crisis}}\n{{See also|Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the United States}}\n[[File:DF-SC-82-06566 Bush hostages Iran.JPEG|thumb|Vice President [[George H.

The 52 American diplomats were held hostage for 444 days. In Iran, the incident was seen by many as a blow against American influence in Iran and the liberal-moderate interim government of Prime Minister [[Mehdi Bazargan]], who opposed the hostage taking, resigned soon after.

The [[Iran-United States Claims Tribunal]] (located in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]) was established for the purpose of handling claims of American nationals against Iran and of Iranian nationals against the United States. American contact with Iran through The Hague covers only legal matters.

This facilitated the modernization of Iran's infrastructure and industry, with as many as 30,000 American expatriates residing in the country in a technical, consulting, or teaching capacity. Some analysts argue that the transformation may have been too rapid, fueling unrest and discontent among an important part of the population in the country and leading to the Revolution in 1979.\n\nAfter the 1979 seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran, the United States [[Executive Order 12170]] froze about $12&nbsp;billion in Iranian assets, including bank deposits, gold and other properties. According to American officials, most of those were released in 1981 as part of the [[Algiers Accords]] to release the hostages. Some assets\u2014Iranian officials say $10&nbsp;billion, but US officials say much less\u2014remain frozen, pending resolution of legal claims arising from the Revolution.\n\nCommercial relations between Iran and the United States are restricted by American [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] and consist mainly of Iranian purchases of food, spare parts, and medical products as well as American purchases of [[carpet]]s and food. Sanctions originally imposed in 1995 by President [[Bill Clinton]] were renewed by President Bush, who cited the \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to American national security posed by Iran. The 1995 executive orders prohibit American companies and their foreign subsidiaries from conducting business with Iran, while banning any \"contract for the financing of the development of petroleum resources located in Iran\". In addition, the [[Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996]] (ILSA) imposed mandatory and discretionary sanctions on non-American companies investing more than $20&nbsp;million annually in the Iranian oil and natural gas sectors.\n\nThe ILSA was renewed for five more years in 2001. [[United States Congress|Congressional]] bills signed in 2006 extended and added provisions to the act; on September 30, 2006, the act was renamed the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), as it no longer applied to Libya, and extended several times.

He pursued a modernizing economic policy, and a strongly pro-American foreign policy; he also made a number of visits to America, where he was regarded as a friend.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nIran's long border with America's Cold War rival, the [[Soviet Union]], and its position as the largest, most powerful country in the oil-rich Persian Gulf, made Iran a \"pillar\" of [[US foreign policy in the Middle East]].<ref>''Twin Pillars to Desert Storm : America's Flawed Vision in the Middle East from Nixon to Bush'' by Howard Teicher ; Gayle Radley Radley, Harpercollins, 1993</ref> Prior to the Iranian Revolution of 1979, many Iranian students and other citizens resided in the United States, and had a positive and welcoming attitude towards America and Americans.<ref name=\"ABC-CLIO\"/> In the 1970s, approximately 25,000 American technicians were deployed to Iran in order to maintain military equipment (such as [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14s]]) that had been sold to the Shah's government.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Fifty-Year Wound|last=Leebaert|first=Derek|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=2003|location=New York, United States of America|pages=382}}</ref> Additionally, from 1950 to 1979, an estimated 800,000 to 850,000 Americans had visited or lived in Iran, and had often expressed their admiration for the Iranian people.<ref name=\"ABC-CLIO\"/>\n\n=== Prime Minister Mossadeq and his overthrow ===\nIn 1953, the government of prime minister [[Mohammed Mossadeq]] was overthrown in a coup organized by the British and American governments.

Established by the British in the early 20th century, the company shared profits (85% for Britain, and 15% for Iran), but the company withheld their financial records from the Iranian government. By 1951, Iranians supported [[nationalization]] of the AIOC, and Parliament unanimously agreed to nationalize its holding of, what was at the time, the British Empire's largest company. The British retaliated with an embargo on Iranian oil, which was supported by international oil companies. Over the following months, negotiations over control and compensation for the oil were deadlocked, and Iran's economy deteriorated.\n\nU.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] pressed Britain to moderate its position in the negotiations and to not invade Iran. American policies created a feeling in Iran that the United States was on Mossadeq's side and optimism that the oil dispute would soon be settled with \"a series of innovative proposals to settle\" the dispute, giving Iran \"significant amounts of economic aid\". Mossadeq visited Washington, and the American government made \"frequent statements expressing support for him.\"<ref>Gasiorowski writing in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', Edited by Mark J.

Iranians' suspicion that the Shah was actually trying to conspire against the Iranian Revolution grew; thus, this incident was often used by the Iranian revolutionaries to justify their claims that the former monarch was an American puppet, and this led to the storming of the American embassy by radical students allied with the Khomeini faction.<ref name=\"autogenerated7\"/>\n\n=== The hostage crisis ===\n{{Main|Iran hostage crisis}}\n{{See also|Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the United States}}\n[[File:DF-SC-82-06566 Bush hostages Iran.JPEG|thumb|Vice President [[George H.

This facilitated the modernization of Iran's infrastructure and industry, with as many as 30,000 American expatriates residing in the country in a technical, consulting, or teaching capacity. Some analysts argue that the transformation may have been too rapid, fueling unrest and discontent among an important part of the population in the country and leading to the Revolution in 1979.\n\nAfter the 1979 seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran, the United States [[Executive Order 12170]] froze about $12 billion in Iranian assets, including bank deposits, gold and other properties. According to American officials, most of those were released in 1981 as part of the [[Algiers Accords]] to release the hostages. Some assets\u2014Iranian officials say $10 billion, but US officials say much less\u2014remain frozen, pending resolution of legal claims arising from the Revolution.\n\nCommercial relations between Iran and the United States are restricted by American [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] and consist mainly of Iranian purchases of food, spare parts, and medical products as well as American purchases of [[carpet]]s and food. Sanctions originally imposed in 1995 by President [[Bill Clinton]] were renewed by President Bush, who cited the \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to American national security posed by Iran.

Until the [[French Revolution]], they styled themselves the \"bishops and princes of Grenoble\".<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 40.</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nAfter the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]], the city was part of the first [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian kingdom]] in the 5th&nbsp;century and the second Burgundian [[Kingdom of Arles]] until 1032, when it was integrated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Arletian rule was interrupted between 942 and 970 due to Arab rule based in [[Fraxinet]].\n\nGrenoble grew significantly in the 11th century when the [[List of Counts of Albon and Dauphins of Viennois|Counts of Albon]] chose the city as the capital of their territories. At the time, their possessions were a patchwork of several territories sprawled across the region.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 9.</ref> The central position of Grenoble allowed the Counts to strengthen their authority. When they later took the title of \"[[Dauphin of France|Dauphins]]\", Grenoble became the capital of the State of [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nDespite their status, the Counts had to share authority over the city with the Bishop of Grenoble. One of the most famous of those was [[Hugh of Ch\u00e2teauneuf|Saint Hugh]]. Under his rule, the city's bridge was rebuilt, and a regular and [[leper]] hospital were built.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 27.</ref>\n[[File:Arms of the Dauphin of France.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|Coat of arms of the Dauphin\u00e9 after becoming a province of France]]\n\nThe inhabitants of Grenoble took advantage of the conflicts between the Counts and the bishops and obtained the recognition of a Charter of Customs that guaranteed their rights.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 32.</ref> That charter was confirmed by Kings [[Louis XI]] in 1447 and [[Francis I of France|Francis&nbsp;I]] in 1541.\n\nIn 1336 the last Dauphin [[Humbert II of Viennois|Humbert&nbsp;II]] founded a court of justice, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Conseil delphinal|fr}}, which settled at Grenoble in 1340. He also established the [[University of Grenoble]] in 1339. Without an heir, Humbert sold his state to France in 1349, on the condition that the heir to the [[List of French monarchs|French crown]] used the title of ''[[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]].''

It was only under his rule that Dauphin\u00e9 properly joined the Kingdom of France. The Old Conseil Delphinal became a [[Parlement]] (the third in France after the Parliaments of Paris and Toulouse), strengthening the status of Grenoble as a Provincial capital. He also ordered the construction of the Palais du Parlement (finished under [[Francis I of France|Francis&nbsp;I]]) and ensured that the Bishop pledged allegiance, thus forging the political union of the city.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 58.</ref>\n\nAt that time, Grenoble was a crossroads between [[Vienne, Is\u00e8re|Vienne]], Geneva, Italy, and [[Savoy]]. It was the industrial centre of the Dauphin\u00e9 and the biggest city of the province, but nonetheless a rather small one.\n\n===Renaissance===\n[[File:Francois-de-bonne-duc-de-le.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois de Bonne, duc de Lesdigui\u00e8res]]\nOwing to Grenoble's geographical situation, French troops were garrisoned in the city and its region during the [[Italian Wars]]. [[Charles VIII of France|Charles&nbsp;VIII]], [[Louis&nbsp;XII]], and [[Francis I of France|Francis&nbsp;I]] went several times to Grenoble. Its people consequently had to suffer from the exactions of the soldiers.\n\nThe nobility of the region took part in various battles ([[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]], [[Battle of Pavia|Pavia]]) and in doing so gained significant prestige.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p78</ref> The best-known of its members was [[Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard|Bayard]], \"the knight without fear and beyond reproach\".\n\nGrenoble suffered as a result of the [[French Wars of Religion]]. The Dauphin\u00e9 was indeed an important settlement for Protestants and therefore experienced several conflicts. The [[Fran\u00e7ois de Beaumont, baron des Adrets|baron des Adrets]], the leader of the [[Huguenots]], pillaged the [[Grenoble Cathedral|Cathedral of Grenoble]] and destroyed the tombs of the former Dauphins.\n\nIn August 1575, [[Fran\u00e7ois de Bonne, duc de Lesdigui\u00e8res|Lesdigui\u00e8res]] became the new leader of the Protestants and, thanks to the accession of [[Henry IV of France|Henry&nbsp;IV]] to the throne of France, allied himself with the governor and the lieutenant general of the Dauphin\u00e9. But this alliance did not bring an end to the conflicts. Indeed, a Catholic movement, the ''Ligue'', which took Grenoble in December 1590, refused to make peace. After months of assaults, Lesdigui\u00e8res defeated the Ligue and took back Grenoble. He became the leader of the entire province.<ref>''Petite Histoire du Dauphin\u00e9 '', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p88</ref>\n\nLesdigui\u00e8res became the lieutenant-general of the Dauphin\u00e9 and administered the Province from 1591 to 1626. He began the construction of the [[Bastille (Grenoble)|Bastille]] in order to protect the city and ordered the construction of new walls, increasing the city's size. He also constructed the H\u00f4tel Lesdigui\u00e8res, built new fountains, and dug sewers.<ref>Histoire de Grenoble, Vidal Chaumel, Editions Privat, p.68,123,126,223</ref>\n\nIn 1689, the bishop [[\u00c9tienne Le Camus]] launched the construction of [[Saint-Louis Church, Grenoble|Saint-Louis Church]].\n\n===From Louis XIV to the French Revolution===\n[[File:Grenoble serr\u00e9 - plan-relief 1848.jpg|thumb|Grenoble [[plan-relief]] (1848).]] \n[[File:Journ\u00e9e des Tuiles (Alexandre Debelle), Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise - Vizille.jpg|thumb|''[[Day of the Tiles]]'', 1890 painting by [[Alexandre Debelle]],<br/> ([[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]]).]]\n\nThe revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] by [[Louis XIV]] caused the departure of 2,000 Protestants from Grenoble, weakening the city's economy.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p97</ref> However, it also weakened the competing glove industry of [[Grasse]], leaving the glove factories of Grenoble without any competition.<ref name=\"Dauphin\u00e9 1933, p98\">''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9 '', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p98</ref> This allowed a stronger economic development for the city during the 18th century.

Following these events, the [[Assembly of Vizille]] took place. Its members organized the meeting of the old [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates General]], thus beginning the [[French Revolution]]. During the Revolution, Grenoble was represented in Paris by two illustrious notables, [[Jean Joseph Mounier]] and [[Antoine Barnave]].\n\nIn 1790, the Dauphin\u00e9 was divided into three [[Departments of France|departments]], and Grenoble became the ''chef-lieu'' of the [[Is\u00e8re|Is\u00e8re department]].

The well-defended city contained the Austrian attacks, and the French army defeated the Austrians, forcing them to withdraw at [[Geneva]]. However, the later [[Six Days Campaign|invasion of France]] in 1814 resulted in the capitulation of the troops and the occupation of the city.\n\nDuring his [[Hundred Days|return]] from the island of [[Elba]] in 1815, Napoleon took a [[Route Napoleon|road]] that led him near Grenoble at [[Laffrey]]. There he met the royalist fifth Infantry Regiment of [[Louis&nbsp;XVIII]]. Napoleon stepped towards the soldiers and said these famous words: \"If there is among you a soldier who wants to kill his Emperor, here I am.\" The soldiers all joined his cause. After that, Napoleon was acclaimed at Grenoble and General [[Jean Gabriel Marchand]] could not prevent Napoleon from entering the city through the Bonne gate. He said later: \"From [[Cannes]] to Grenoble, I still was an adventurer; in that last city, I came back a sovereign\".<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9 '', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p120</ref> But after the defeat of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], the region suffered from a new invasion of Austrian and Sardinian troops.\n[[File:Fontaine trois ordres - Grenoble.JPG|thumb|Fountain of the Three Orders (1897)]]\n\nThe 19th century saw significant industrial development of Grenoble.

Shortly thereafter Grenoble experienced widespread destruction by [[Grenoble Flood 1859|extensive flooding]] in 1859,.\n\nIn 1869 engineer [[Aristide Berg\u00e8s]] played a major role in industrializing hydroelectricity production. With the development of his paper mills, he accelerated the economic development of the Gr\u00e9sivaudan valley and Grenoble.\n\nOn 4 August 1897, a stone and bronze fountain was inaugurated in Grenoble to commemorate the pre-revolutionary events of June 1788. Built by the sculptor [[Henri Ding]], the Fountain of the Three Orders, which represents three characters, is located on the Place Notre-Dame.

Electro-chemical factories were also established in the area surrounding Grenoble, initially to produce chemical weapons. This development resulted in significant immigration to Grenoble, particularly from Italian workers who settled in the Saint-Laurent neighborhood.\n[[File:Entr\u00e9e exposition H.B. - Grenoble.jpg|thumb|Gate of the exposition in 1925]]\n\nThe economic development of the city was highlighted by the organization of the [[International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism]] in 1925, which was visited by more than 1&nbsp;million people.<ref>[[:fr:Exposition internationale de la houille blanche#Les chiffres]]</ref> The organization of this exhibition forced the military to remove the old city walls and allowed expansion of the city to the south. This exhibition also highlighted the city's hydropower industry and the region's tourist attractions.\n\nThe site of the exhibition became an urban park in 1926, named [[Parc Paul Mistral]] after the death of the mayor in 1932. The only building of this exhibition remaining in the park is the crumbling [[Perret tower (Grenoble)|Tour Perret]], which has been closed to the public since 1960 due to its very poor state of maintenance.\n\nDuring World War II, at the [[Battle of the Alps]], the Nazi invasion was stopped near Grenoble at [[Voreppe]] by the forces of [[General Cartier]] in June 1940. The French forces resisted until the armistice. Grenoble was then part of the [[French State]], before an Italian occupation from 1942 to 1943. The relative mercy of the Italian occupiers towards the Jewish populations resulted in a significant number moving to the region from the German-occupied parts of France.<ref>''L\u2019histoire\u2026'', Tome 5, Gilbert Bouchard, 2004, p45</ref>\n\nGrenoble was extremely active in the [[French Resistance|R\u00e9sistance]] against the occupation.

On 11 November 1943 (the anniversary of the [[World War I|armistice of 1918]]) massive strikes and demonstrations took place in front of the local collaboration offices. In response, the occupiers arrested 400 demonstrators in the streets. On 13 November, the resistance blew up the artillery at the Polygon, which was a psychological shock for an enemy who then intensified the repression.

With the [[Operation Dragoon|landing in Provence]], German troops evacuated the city on 22 August 1944. On 5 November 1944, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] came to Grenoble and bestowed on the city the ''[[Ordre de la Lib\u00e9ration|Compagnon de la Lib\u00e9ration]]'' in order to recognise \"a heroic city at the peak of the French resistance and combat for the liberation\".<ref name=\"ordredelaliberation.fr\"/>\n\nIn 1955, future [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physics Nobel prize]] laureate [[Louis N\u00e9el]] created the Grenoble Center for Nuclear Studies (CENG), resulting in the birth of the Grenoble model, a combination of research and industry.

To the north lies the [[Chartreuse Mountains|Chartreuse]], to the south and west the [[Vercors Plateau|Vercors]], and to the east the [[Belledonne|Belledonne range]]. Grenoble is regarded as the capital of the French Alps.\n\nExcept for a few dozen houses on the slopes of the [[Bastille (Grenoble)|Bastille]] hill of Chartreuse, Grenoble is exclusively built on the alluvial plain of the rivers [[Is\u00e8re (river)|Is\u00e8re]] and [[Drac (river)|Drac]] at an altitude of {{convert|214|m|ft}}. As a result, the city itself is extremely flat. Mountain sports are an important tourist attraction in summer and winter. Twenty large and small ski resorts surround the city, the nearest being [[:fr:Le Sappey-en-Chartreuse|Le Sappey-en-Chartreuse]], which is about 15 minutes' drive away.\n\nHistorically,  both Grenoble and the surrounding areas were sites of heavy industry and mining.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 67.</ref> Abandoned mills and factories can be found in small towns and villages, and a few have been converted to tourist attractions, such as the coal mine at [[La Mure]].\n\n===Climate===\n\nGrenoble itself has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : '''Cfb'''), closely bordering on a [[humid continental climate]] ('''Dfb'''), and even on a mid-latitude, four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] ('''Cfa''') in downtown. In spite of being classified as maritime, Grenoble contains significant seasonal differences between the warm to hot summers and the cool to cold winters. Both temperatures above {{convert|30|C|F}} for the summer months and winter [[air frost]]s are common. In addition, the climate is much gloomier than the Mediterranean region, although less so than northern France. Rainfall is quite heavy by French standards, although the number of rainy days is relatively moderate.

In the early 20th century the Museum of Grenoble became the first French museum to open its collections to modern art, and its collection of modern and contemporary art has grown to become one of the largest in Europe. The painting holdings include works by painters such as [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Rubens]], [[Zurbar\u00e1n]], [[Ingres]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], [[Paul Signac|Signac]], [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Picasso]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[Andy Warhol]]. The museum also presents a few Egyptian antiquities as well as Greek and Roman artifacts. The Sculpture collection features works by [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Matisse]], [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Alexander Calder]]. In April 2010, the ''prophetess of Antinoe'', a 6th-century mummy discovered in 1907 in the [[Copts|Coptic]] [[necropolis]] of [[Antinopolis|Antinoe]] in Middle Egypt, returned to the Museum of Grenoble, after more than fifty years of absence and an extensive restoration.\n\n===Archaeological museums ===\n[[File:Mus\u00e9e arch\u00e9ologique de Grenoble 027.jpg|thumb|[[Grenoble Archaeological Museum|Archaeological]] museum with the vestiges protected by a new cover of glass and metal (Place Saint-Laurent)]]\n\nSituated on the right bank of the Is\u00e8re, on Place Saint-Laurent, the [[Grenoble Archaeological Museum]] presents the archaeological excavations done on its location.

From that time on, the bishops exercised significant political power over the city. Until the [[French Revolution]], they styled themselves the \"bishops and princes of Grenoble\".<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 40.</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nAfter the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]], the city was part of the first [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian kingdom]] in the 5th&nbsp;century and the second Burgundian [[Kingdom of Arles]] until 1032, when it was integrated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Arletian rule was interrupted between 942 and 970 due to Arab rule based in [[Fraxinet]].\n\nGrenoble grew significantly in the 11th century when the [[List of Counts of Albon and Dauphins of Viennois|Counts of Albon]] chose the city as the capital of their territories. At the time, their possessions were a patchwork of several territories sprawled across the region.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 9.</ref> The central position of Grenoble allowed the Counts to strengthen their authority. When they later took the title of \"[[Dauphin of France|Dauphins]]\", Grenoble became the capital of the State of [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nDespite their status, the Counts had to share authority over the city with the Bishop of Grenoble. One of the most famous of those was [[Hugh of Ch\u00e2teauneuf|Saint Hugh]]. Under his rule, the city's bridge was rebuilt, and a regular and [[leper]] hospital were built.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 27.</ref>\n[[File:Arms of the Dauphin of France.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|Coat of arms of the Dauphin\u00e9 after becoming a province of France]]\n\nThe inhabitants of Grenoble took advantage of the conflicts between the Counts and the bishops and obtained the recognition of a Charter of Customs that guaranteed their rights.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 32.</ref> That charter was confirmed by Kings [[Louis XI]] in 1447 and [[Francis I of France|Francis&nbsp;I]] in 1541.\n\nIn 1336 the last Dauphin [[Humbert II of Viennois|Humbert&nbsp;II]] founded a court of justice, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Conseil delphinal|fr}}, which settled at Grenoble in 1340. He also established the [[University of Grenoble]] in 1339. Without an heir, Humbert sold his state to France in 1349, on the condition that the heir to the [[List of French monarchs|French crown]] used the title of ''[[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]].''

It was only under his rule that Dauphin\u00e9 properly joined the Kingdom of France. The Old Conseil Delphinal became a [[Parlement]] (the third in France after the Parliaments of Paris and Toulouse), strengthening the status of Grenoble as a Provincial capital. He also ordered the construction of the Palais du Parlement (finished under [[Francis I of France|Francis&nbsp;I]]) and ensured that the Bishop pledged allegiance, thus forging the political union of the city.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 58.</ref>\n\nAt that time, Grenoble was a crossroads between [[Vienne, Is\u00e8re|Vienne]], Geneva, Italy, and [[Savoy]]. It was the industrial centre of the Dauphin\u00e9 and the biggest city of the province, but nonetheless a rather small one.\n\n===Renaissance===\n[[File:Francois-de-bonne-duc-de-le.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois de Bonne, duc de Lesdigui\u00e8res]]\nOwing to Grenoble's geographical situation, French troops were garrisoned in the city and its region during the [[Italian Wars]]. [[Charles VIII of France|Charles&nbsp;VIII]], [[Louis&nbsp;XII]], and [[Francis I of France|Francis&nbsp;I]] went several times to Grenoble. Its people consequently had to suffer from the exactions of the soldiers.\n\nThe nobility of the region took part in various battles ([[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]], [[Battle of Pavia|Pavia]]) and in doing so gained significant prestige.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p78</ref> The best-known of its members was [[Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard|Bayard]], \"the knight without fear and beyond reproach\".\n\nGrenoble suffered as a result of the [[French Wars of Religion]]. The Dauphin\u00e9 was indeed an important settlement for Protestants and therefore experienced several conflicts. The [[Fran\u00e7ois de Beaumont, baron des Adrets|baron des Adrets]], the leader of the [[Huguenots]], pillaged the [[Grenoble Cathedral|Cathedral of Grenoble]] and destroyed the tombs of the former Dauphins.\n\nIn August 1575, [[Fran\u00e7ois de Bonne, duc de Lesdigui\u00e8res|Lesdigui\u00e8res]] became the new leader of the Protestants and, thanks to the accession of [[Henry IV of France|Henry&nbsp;IV]] to the throne of France, allied himself with the governor and the lieutenant general of the Dauphin\u00e9. But this alliance did not bring an end to the conflicts. Indeed, a Catholic movement, the ''Ligue'', which took Grenoble in December 1590, refused to make peace. After months of assaults, Lesdigui\u00e8res defeated the Ligue and took back Grenoble. He became the leader of the entire province.<ref>''Petite Histoire du Dauphin\u00e9 '', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p88</ref>\n\nLesdigui\u00e8res became the lieutenant-general of the Dauphin\u00e9 and administered the Province from 1591 to 1626. He began the construction of the [[Bastille (Grenoble)|Bastille]] in order to protect the city and ordered the construction of new walls, increasing the city's size. He also constructed the H\u00f4tel Lesdigui\u00e8res, built new fountains, and dug sewers.<ref>Histoire de Grenoble, Vidal Chaumel, Editions Privat, p.68,123,126,223</ref>\n\nIn 1689, the bishop [[\u00c9tienne Le Camus]] launched the construction of [[Saint-Louis Church, Grenoble|Saint-Louis Church]].\n\n===From Louis XIV to the French Revolution===\n[[File:Grenoble serr\u00e9 - plan-relief 1848.jpg|thumb|Grenoble [[plan-relief]] (1848).]] \n[[File:Journ\u00e9e des Tuiles (Alexandre Debelle), Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise - Vizille.jpg|thumb|''[[Day of the Tiles]]'', 1890 painting by [[Alexandre Debelle]],<br/> ([[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]]).]]\n\nThe revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] by [[Louis XIV]] caused the departure of 2,000 Protestants from Grenoble, weakening the city's economy.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p97</ref> However, it also weakened the competing glove industry of [[Grasse]], leaving the glove factories of Grenoble without any competition.<ref name=\"Dauphin\u00e9 1933, p98\">''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9 '', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p98</ref> This allowed a stronger economic development for the city during the 18th century.

Following these events, the [[Assembly of Vizille]] took place. Its members organized the meeting of the old [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates General]], thus beginning the [[French Revolution]]. During the Revolution, Grenoble was represented in Paris by two illustrious notables, [[Jean Joseph Mounier]] and [[Antoine Barnave]].\n\nIn 1790, the Dauphin\u00e9 was divided into three [[Departments of France|departments]], and Grenoble became the ''chef-lieu'' of the [[Is\u00e8re|Is\u00e8re department]].

The well-defended city contained the Austrian attacks, and the French army defeated the Austrians, forcing them to withdraw at [[Geneva]]. However, the later [[Six Days Campaign|invasion of France]] in 1814 resulted in the capitulation of the troops and the occupation of the city.\n\nDuring his [[Hundred Days|return]] from the island of [[Elba]] in 1815, Napoleon took a [[Route Napoleon|road]] that led him near Grenoble at [[Laffrey]]. There he met the royalist fifth Infantry Regiment of [[Louis&nbsp;XVIII]]. Napoleon stepped towards the soldiers and said these famous words: \"If there is among you a soldier who wants to kill his Emperor, here I am.\" The soldiers all joined his cause. After that, Napoleon was acclaimed at Grenoble and General [[Jean Gabriel Marchand]] could not prevent Napoleon from entering the city through the Bonne gate. He said later: \"From [[Cannes]] to Grenoble, I still was an adventurer; in that last city, I came back a sovereign\".<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9 '', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p120</ref> But after the defeat of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], the region suffered from a new invasion of Austrian and Sardinian troops.\n[[File:Fontaine trois ordres - Grenoble.JPG|thumb|Fountain of the Three Orders (1897)]]\n\nThe 19th century saw significant industrial development of Grenoble.

Shortly thereafter Grenoble experienced widespread destruction by [[Grenoble Flood 1859|extensive flooding]] in 1859,.\n\nIn 1869 engineer [[Aristide Berg\u00e8s]] played a major role in industrializing hydroelectricity production. With the development of his paper mills, he accelerated the economic development of the Gr\u00e9sivaudan valley and Grenoble.\n\nOn 4 August 1897, a stone and bronze fountain was inaugurated in Grenoble to commemorate the pre-revolutionary events of June 1788. Built by the sculptor [[Henri Ding]], the Fountain of the Three Orders, which represents three characters, is located on the Place Notre-Dame.

Electro-chemical factories were also established in the area surrounding Grenoble, initially to produce chemical weapons. This development resulted in significant immigration to Grenoble, particularly from Italian workers who settled in the Saint-Laurent neighborhood.\n[[File:Entr\u00e9e exposition H.B. - Grenoble.jpg|thumb|Gate of the exposition in 1925]]\n\nThe economic development of the city was highlighted by the organization of the [[International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism]] in 1925, which was visited by more than 1&nbsp;million people.<ref>[[:fr:Exposition internationale de la houille blanche#Les chiffres]]</ref> The organization of this exhibition forced the military to remove the old city walls and allowed expansion of the city to the south. This exhibition also highlighted the city's hydropower industry and the region's tourist attractions.\n\nThe site of the exhibition became an urban park in 1926, named [[Parc Paul Mistral]] after the death of the mayor in 1932. The only building of this exhibition remaining in the park is the crumbling [[Perret tower (Grenoble)|Tour Perret]], which has been closed to the public since 1960 due to its very poor state of maintenance.\n\nDuring World War II, at the [[Battle of the Alps]], the Nazi invasion was stopped near Grenoble at [[Voreppe]] by the forces of [[General Cartier]] in June 1940. The French forces resisted until the armistice. Grenoble was then part of the [[French State]], before an Italian occupation from 1942 to 1943. The relative mercy of the Italian occupiers towards the Jewish populations resulted in a significant number moving to the region from the German-occupied parts of France.<ref>''L\u2019histoire\u2026'', Tome 5, Gilbert Bouchard, 2004, p45</ref>\n\nGrenoble was extremely active in the [[French Resistance|R\u00e9sistance]] against the occupation.

On 11 November 1943 (the anniversary of the [[World War I|armistice of 1918]]) massive strikes and demonstrations took place in front of the local collaboration offices. In response, the occupiers arrested 400 demonstrators in the streets. On 13 November, the resistance blew up the artillery at the Polygon, which was a psychological shock for an enemy who then intensified the repression.

With the [[Operation Dragoon|landing in Provence]], German troops evacuated the city on 22 August 1944.

To the north lies the [[Chartreuse Mountains|Chartreuse]], to the south and west the [[Vercors Plateau|Vercors]], and to the east the [[Belledonne|Belledonne range]]. Grenoble is regarded as the capital of the French Alps.\n\nExcept for a few dozen houses on the slopes of the [[Bastille (Grenoble)|Bastille]] hill of Chartreuse, Grenoble is exclusively built on the alluvial plain of the rivers [[Is\u00e8re (river)|Is\u00e8re]] and [[Drac (river)|Drac]] at an altitude of {{convert|214|m|ft}}. As a result, the city itself is extremely flat. Mountain sports are an important tourist attraction in summer and winter. Twenty large and small ski resorts surround the city, the nearest being [[:fr:Le Sappey-en-Chartreuse|Le Sappey-en-Chartreuse]], which is about 15 minutes' drive away.\n\nHistorically,  both Grenoble and the surrounding areas were sites of heavy industry and mining.<ref>''Petite histoire du Dauphin\u00e9'', F\u00e9lix Vernay, 1933, p. 67.</ref> Abandoned mills and factories can be found in small towns and villages, and a few have been converted to tourist attractions, such as the coal mine at [[La Mure]].\n\n===Climate===\n\nGrenoble itself has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : '''Cfb'''), closely bordering on a [[humid continental climate]] ('''Dfb'''), and even on a mid-latitude, four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] ('''Cfa''') in downtown. In spite of being classified as maritime, Grenoble contains significant seasonal differences between the warm to hot summers and the cool to cold winters. Both temperatures above {{convert|30|C|F}} for the summer months and winter [[air frost]]s are common. In addition, the climate is much gloomier than the Mediterranean region, although less so than northern France. Rainfall is quite heavy by French standards, although the number of rainy days is relatively moderate.

In the early 20th century the Museum of Grenoble became the first French museum to open its collections to modern art, and its collection of modern and contemporary art has grown to become one of the largest in Europe. The painting holdings include works by painters such as [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Rubens]], [[Zurbar\u00e1n]], [[Ingres]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], [[Paul Signac|Signac]], [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Picasso]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[Andy Warhol]]. The museum also presents a few Egyptian antiquities as well as Greek and Roman artifacts. The Sculpture collection features works by [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Matisse]], [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Alexander Calder]]. In April 2010, the ''prophetess of Antinoe'', a 6th-century mummy discovered in 1907 in the [[Copts|Coptic]] [[necropolis]] of [[Antinopolis|Antinoe]] in Middle Egypt, returned to the Museum of Grenoble, after more than fifty years of absence and an extensive restoration.\n\n===Archaeological museums ===\n[[File:Mus\u00e9e arch\u00e9ologique de Grenoble 027.jpg|thumb|[[Grenoble Archaeological Museum|Archaeological]] museum with the vestiges protected by a new cover of glass and metal (Place Saint-Laurent)]]\n\nSituated on the right bank of the Is\u00e8re, on Place Saint-Laurent, the [[Grenoble Archaeological Museum]] presents the archaeological excavations done on its location.

Being essentially flat, Grenoble is also a bicycle-friendly city.\n\nThe [[Gare de Grenoble]] is served by the [[TGV]] rail network, with frequent high-speed services (3 hours) to and from [[Paris-Gare de Lyon]], usually with a stop at [[Lyon-Saint Exup\u00e9ry Airport|Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport]]. While Grenoble is not directly on any high-speed line, TGVs can run at reduced speeds on the classic network and enable such connections. [[Transport express r\u00e9gional|Local rail]] services connect Grenoble with [[Lyon]], and less frequently to [[Geneva]], to [[Valence, Dr\u00f4me|Valence]], and to destinations to the South. [[Valence, Dr\u00f4me|Valence]] and Lyon to the West provides connections with TGV services along the Rh\u00f4ne Valley.
