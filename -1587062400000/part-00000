It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the [[Latin]] motto ''Animo et Fide'', which loosely translated, means ''With Courage and Faith''.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\">{{cite web | url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | title=Stockport \u2013 Explanation of the Arms of Stockport | publisher=manchester2002-uk.com | accessdate=29 August 2015 | last=Moss | first=John | date=28 April 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122022349/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | archive-date=22 November 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\" /><ref name=\"Secret Stockport\" /> The twin-towered castle above the shield is [[Stockport Castle]], which stood until 1775.<ref name=\"STOCKPORT CASTLE\">{{PastScape|mnumber=1085399 | mname=STOCKPORT CASTLE | accessdate=29 August 2015|date=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. Stockport's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three kits for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making Stockport the only senior club in the UK to wear the Umbro strip in the 2013\u201314 season.<ref name=\"Background\" /><ref name=\"New Kit Deal Agreed\">{{cite web |

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

They made a short experiment with an [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black shorts, after the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]]. This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s.

It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the [[Latin]] motto ''Animo et Fide'', which loosely translated, means ''With Courage and Faith''.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\">{{cite web | url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | title=Stockport \u2013 Explanation of the Arms of Stockport | publisher=manchester2002-uk.com | accessdate=29 August 2015 | last=Moss | first=John | date=28 April 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122022349/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | archive-date=22 November 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\" /><ref name=\"Secret Stockport\" /> The twin-towered castle above the shield is [[Stockport Castle]], which stood until 1775.<ref name=\"STOCKPORT CASTLE\">{{PastScape|mnumber=1085399 | mname=STOCKPORT CASTLE | accessdate=29 August 2015|date=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. Stockport's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three kits for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making Stockport the only senior club in the

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

The function of the tectospinal tract is to mediate reflex postural movements of the head in response to visual and auditory stimuli.\n\nThe portion of the midbrain from where this tract originates is the [[superior colliculus]], which receives afferents from the visual nuclei (primarily the [[oculomotor nuclei complex]]), then projects to the [[contralateral]] (decussating dorsal to the mesencephalic duct) and ipsilateral portion of the first cervical [[neuromere]]s of the [[spinal cord]], the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei in the midbrain and the abducens nucleus in the caudal portion of the pons.\n\nThe tract descends to the [[cervical spinal cord]] to terminate in [[Rexed laminae]] VI, VII, and VIII to coordinate [[head]], [[neck]], and [[human eye|eye]] movements, primarily in response to visual stimuli.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Upper motor neuron]]\n* [[Spinotectal tract]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051125132409/http://faculty.etsu.edu/currie/images/neuro2.jpg Diagram at etsu.edu] \n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060428130013/http://sky.bsd.uchicago.edu/lcy_ref/synap/spmotor.html Overview and diagram at uchicago.edu] \n* {{BrainInfo|hier|783}}\n\n{{Spinal cord}}\n{{Mesencephalon}}\n{{Neural tracts}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Spinal cord tracts]]\n[[Category:Motor system]]\n", "name_user": "Me, Myself, and I are Here", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:alpha", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectospinal_tract"}

After searching the mountains, [[Kublai Khan]] was overjoyed to find four fat sheep, and asked his subordinates to kill and cook them. At this moment, a soldier rushed in and reported that the enemies were approaching. The chef, knowing he had no time to cook the sheep, cut out ten pieces of thin meat with a knife, and stirred them into boiling water. When the color of the meat changed, the chef immediately put them in a bowl and sprinkled them with coarse salt. Kublai Khan ate a few pieces and turned around to lead the army. Later, [[Kublai Khan]] named this dish \"instant-boiled mutton\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.littlesheep.com/Brand/PrairieFire|title=\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a|website=www.littlesheep.com|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Founding ===\nZhang Gang is the founder of Little Sheep. There are two versions of how Little Sheep is created in Baotou. One theory is that Zhang Gang developed a method of eating hotpot without cooking, so he opened a hotpot restaurant with a few friends that grew wildly popular. Another theory is that Zhang Gang and a friend had a meal together and found out that the hot pot was delicious and easy to promote, so he spent a lot of money to buy the hot pot base recipe and began to develop the little sheep hot pot.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.795.com.cn/wz/48859.html|title=\u5f20\u94a2\uff0c\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a\u7684\u9910\u996e\u5e1d\u56fd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFinally, Zhang Gang and others worked out a recipe for Little Sheep. Before opening the restaurant, everyone was worried about what to name the restaurant. One day, Zhang Gang casually said \"Little Sheep\", and his daughter-in-law immediately said: \"The name is good, and it is related to mutton lamb. I'm sure I can't forget it after eating, and it's easy to remember.\" And then, \"Little Sheep\" was born.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOn August 8, 1999, the first \"Little Sheep\" of the \"Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd.\" was opened at No.22 Wulan Road, Kun District, [[Baotou]]City.

Xilinguole grassland has high-quality natural grassland area of more than 180,000 square kilometres and a unique geographical position of 45 \u00b0 north latitude, which has created the natural quality of pastures and bred fertile Mongolian sheep, such as well-known \"Wuzhumuqin Sheep(\u4e4c\u73e0\u7a46\u6c81\u7f8a)\", \"Sunite Sheep(\u82cf\u5c3c\u7279\u7f8a)\", and \"Wulatetan Sheep(\u4e4c\u62c9\u7279\u6ee9\u7f8a)\". only six-month-old lamb will be selected, because the meat is fresh and tender, not smelly or stale.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Menu ==\nThe Little Sheep has been serving high-quality lamb, beef, and other specials.

After searching the mountains, [[Kublai Khan]] was overjoyed to find four fat sheep, and asked his subordinates to kill and cook them. At this moment, a soldier rushed in and reported that the enemies were approaching. The chef, knowing he had no time to cook the sheep, cut out ten pieces of thin meat with a knife, and stirred them into boiling water. When the color of the meat changed, the chef immediately put them in a bowl and sprinkled them with coarse salt. Kublai Khan ate a few pieces and turned around to lead the army. Later, [[Kublai Khan]] named this dish \"instant-boiled mutton\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.littlesheep.com/Brand/PrairieFire|title=\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a|website=www.littlesheep.com|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Founding ===\nZhang Gang is the founder of Little Sheep. There are two versions of how Little Sheep is created in Baotou. One theory is that Zhang Gang developed a method of eating hotpot without cooking, so he opened a hotpot restaurant with a few friends that grew wildly popular. Another theory is that Zhang Gang and a friend had a meal together and found out that the hot pot was delicious and easy to promote, so he spent a lot of money to buy the hot pot base recipe and began to develop the little sheep hot pot.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.795.com.cn/wz/48859.html|title=\u5f20\u94a2\uff0c\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a\u7684\u9910\u996e\u5e1d\u56fd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFinally, Zhang Gang and others worked out a recipe for Little Sheep. Before opening the restaurant, everyone was worried about what to name the restaurant. One day, Zhang Gang casually said \"Little Sheep\", and his daughter-in-law immediately said: \"The name is good, and it is related to mutton lamb. I'm sure I can't forget it after eating, and it's easy to remember.\" And then, \"Little Sheep\" was born.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOn August 8, 1999, the first \"Little Sheep\" of the \"Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd.\" was opened at No.22 Wulan Road, Kun District, [[Baotou]]City.

In addition, the special smell of raw lamb is not accepted by southerners in China, so lamb mutton was regional. \"Little Sheep\" has made innovations on the basis of traditional\"instant-boiled mutton\", pioneering the method of \"simmering mutton without dipped in ingredients\": a pot-base soup made from dozens of nourishing condiments. By changing cumbersome ingredients, this method removes the special smell of lamb while retaining its delicious flavor.

Xilinguole grassland has become one of the world's four most famous grasslands due to its wide range of types of flora and fauna. Its rich aquatic plants provide sufficient natural food for sheep without supplementary feeding. Xilinguole grassland has high-quality natural grassland area of more than 180,000 square kilometres and a unique geographical position of 45 \u00b0 north latitude, which has created the natural quality of pastures and bred fertile Mongolian sheep, such as well-known \"Wuzhumuqin Sheep(\u4e4c\u73e0\u7a46\u6c81\u7f8a)\", \"Sunite Sheep(\u82cf\u5c3c\u7279\u7f8a)\", and \"Wulatetan Sheep(\u4e4c\u62c9\u7279\u6ee9\u7f8a)\". only six-month-old lamb will be selected, because the meat is fresh and tender, not smelly or stale.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Menu ==\nThe Little Sheep has been serving high-quality lamb, beef, and other specials. Signatures include Lamb-lover Platter, Signature AAA Lamb Rolls, Mongolian Style Roasted Lamb Shank, Premium Beef Cube, Premium Grain Feb Beef New Zealand Origin, Handmade Squid Paste with Fish Caviar, and so on.

Before this incident, there were various other episodes in which Norwalk was mocked: The characters refused to swim in a Norwalk swimming pool, acting like the pool water was diseased because of Norwalk people; one of the children took bets on how many of the girlfriends of Norwalk\u2019s basketball team would be pregnant post season; and Oliver Otto used a neighbor's Hispanic housekeeper to alter flawed Polo shirts and sell them to Norwalk students, believing that no Westport resident would buy them; Oliver ended up earning a lot of money. This brought condemnation from residents, school officials, and politicians of Norwalk.

Compared to the other residents who own big houses, Katie and her family are renters of a more modest home. She lives with Greg, her level-headed husband who is a university professor of history, and their three children. Taylor is their athletic, headstrong, but somewhat dimwitted oldest daughter who wants to fit in with her peers; Oliver, their savvy, ambitious, and snarky son, is the middle child; and Anna-Kat, sweet but obsessive-compulsive, is the youngest and Katie's blatant favorite. Katie frequently vents her frustration to and seeks advice from her two closest friends: Doris, whose strict parenting style sharply contrasts with Katie's; and Angela, a divorced lesbian mother and lawyer with a calm parenting style.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of American Housewife episodes}}\n{{:List of American Housewife episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Katy Mixon]] as Kate \"Katie\" Otto\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Greg Otto, Katie's husband\n* [[Meg Donnelly]] as Taylor \u201cSweetheart\u201d Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage daughter; <small>the role was portrayed by [[Johnny Sequoyah]] in the televised pilot<!-- SHE WAS CREDITED AS MAIN CAST IN THE PILOT --></small><ref name=\"DonnellyRecasting\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/07/american-housewife-meg-donnelly-cast-abc-comedy-recasting-1201793752/ |title='American Housewife': Meg Donnelly Added To New ABC Comedy In Recasting |last=Petski |first=Denise |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Daniel DiMaggio]] as Oliver Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage son and middle child\n* [[Julia Butters]] as Anna-Kat Otto, Katie and Greg's youngest daughter\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Doris, one of Katie's best friends\n* Carly Hughes as Angela, one of Katie's best friends\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Viv, Katy's neighbor who was originally introduced as Two-Fitbit Lady\n* [[Jessica St. Clair]] as Chloe Brown Mueller, Katie's arch nemesis\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Kathryn, Katie's mother\n* Logan Pepper as Cooper Bradford, Oliver's uber-wealthy best friend whose parents are almost always out of town; as such, Cooper adores Katie as a mother figure, even when she's strict with the Otto children\n* Amarr M.

Before this incident, there were various other episodes in which Norwalk was mocked: The characters refused to swim in a Norwalk swimming pool, acting like the pool water was diseased because of Norwalk people; one of the children took bets on how many of the girlfriends of Norwalk\u2019s basketball team would be pregnant post season; and Oliver Otto used a neighbor's Hispanic housekeeper to alter flawed Polo shirts and sell them to Norwalk students, believing that no Westport resident would buy them; Oliver ended up earning a lot of money.

We\u2019ve heard the concerns of the people of Norwalk and have made the decision to omit any mentions of the city from future episodes\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehour.com/news/article/American-Housewife-to-omit-Norwalk-from-future-12390310.php|title=Following outcry, \"American Housewife\" to omit Norwalk from future episodes|author=Kaitlyn Krasselt|date=29 November 2017|accessdate=30 November 2017|newspaper=[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:ELMINOFFICIAL]], choose one official website only -->\n* {{Official website|http://abc.go.com/shows/american-housewife}}\n* {{IMDb title|5396394}}\n\n{{ABCNetwork Shows (current and upcoming)}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American single-camera sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2020s American single-camera sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2010s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2016 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related sitcoms]]\n[[Category:Television production suspended due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by ABC Studios]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Connecticut]]\n", "name_user": "Howenstein115", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRecurring", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Housewife"}
