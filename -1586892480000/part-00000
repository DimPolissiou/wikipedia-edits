Among other things Drawbell wrote three autobiographies, which, in addition to being valuable and often minute accounts of the changing age, also contain unique and insightful recollections of his encounters with famous people from all walks of life\u2014ranging from great men of letters such as [[F.

Once, he was known as one of the Tower of Fang's most promising black sorcerers. One day, Orphen was approached by Volkan and Dortin, who had a very profitable money making scheme set up. Under the guise of wealthy merchants, they set forth toward the Everlasting household to partake in a marriage fraud. But, there was one problem: Volcan's plan was full of holes, leading one of the sisters to find out about their plan too. Then suddenly, a huge monster attacks the mansion. Among all the commotion, one name rings out: Azalie. This monster was what he was looking for<!--not a mistake--> for five years: his older sister Azalie who transformed into a dragonic monster. Between those who seek to kill the monster and Orphen, giving everything to protect it, his peaceful days are at an end. Trying desperately to transform his sister, Azalie, back to her true form leads to a treacherous journey that, ultimately, allows Orphen to learn the vast secrets of his world.\n\n==Media==\n===Light novels===\nAfter publishing an award-winning Japanese-style fantasy  novel \"Inside a sparkle from the snow\" Yoshinobu Akita who possessed deep admiration for European and American literature started his work on a European-style fantasy about the magically created world of Orphen inhabited by characters with deep personalities that make a reader empathize with them.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe series Orphen came about when author Yoshinobu Akita with Yuuya Kusaka as illustrator created a series of [[light novel]]s called \"Majutsushi Orphen Haguretabi.\" It consists of 20 novels which were first published by [[Fujimi Shobo]] under their [[Fujimi Fantasia Bunko]] label in the ''[[Monthly Dragon Magazine]]'' between 1994\u20132003, and was the basis for the first anime and manga series.

Once, he was known as one of the Tower of Fang's most promising black sorcerers. One day, Orphen was approached by Volkan and Dortin, who had a very profitable money making scheme set up. Under the guise of wealthy merchants, they set forth toward the Everlasting household to partake in a marriage fraud. But, there was one problem: Volcan's plan was full of holes, leading one of the sisters to find out about their plan too. Then suddenly, a huge monster attacks the mansion. Among all the commotion, one name rings out: Azalie. This monster was what he was looking for<!--not a mistake--> for five years: his older sister Azalie who transformed into a dragonic monster. Between those who seek to kill the monster and Orphen, giving everything to protect it, his peaceful days are at an end. Trying desperately to transform his sister, Azalie, back to her true form leads to a treacherous journey that, ultimately, allows Orphen to learn the vast secrets of his world.\n\n==Media==\n===Light novels===\nAfter publishing an award-winning Japanese-style fantasy  novel \"Inside a sparkle from the snow\" Yoshinobu Akita who possessed deep admiration for European and American literature started his work on a European-style fantasy about the magically created world of Orphen inhabited by characters with deep personalities that make a reader empathize with them.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe series Orphen came about when author Yoshinobu Akita with Yuuya Kusaka as illustrator created a series of [[light novel]]s called \"Majutsushi Orphen Haguretabi.\" It consists of 20 novels which were first published by [[Fujimi Shobo]] under their [[Fujimi Fantasia Bunko]] label in the ''[[Monthly Dragon Magazine]]'' between 1994\u20132003, and was the basis for the first anime and manga series. In September 2019, Yoshinobu Akita announced that in commemoration of the series' 25th anniversary, he will be writing a new novel for the main novella series titled \"Sorcerer Stabber Orphen: Comicron's Plan\", a prequel that takes place four years after Orphen departed the Tower of Fangs to search for Azalie. which will be released on 25 December 2019.

WKOX-FM was the Boston area's first FM top 40 station featuring live [[disc jockey]]s, including hosts Bill Thomas, Brother Bill Heizer, FM Douglas, program director Dick Stevens, John Leisher, Alan Fraser, J. William Charles, with Kenny McKay and Jimmy Conlee. WKOX-FM converted to [[Stereophonic sound|stereo broadcasting]] that July.\n\n===WVBF (1971-1993)===\n{{Distinguish||text=Middleborough Center, Massachusetts radio station [[WVBF]]}}\nWKOX and WKOX-FM were acquired by Fairbanks Communications in July 1971. After the sale, WKOX-FM became WVBF (also known as the ''Electronic Mama''), as a hybrid top 40/rock station, initially retaining some of the WKOX-FM personalities. The call letters officially stood for \"Welcome, Virginia Brown Fairbanks\", the wife of station owner Richard M. Fairbanks; Richard also had a station named after himself, [[WRMF]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. WVBF improved its signal coverage, targeting the [[Greater Boston]] area. Some hosts added to WVBF during their early months included Buddy Ballou, John \"Big John\" Gillis, Bill \"BLF Bash\" Freeman and Charlie Kendall.\n\nDuring Fairbanks ownership in the 1970s, WVBF evolved from being a high energy top 40/rock hybrid station in 1971/1972, to becoming a mainstream [[top 40]] station by 1975, and eventually evolved into a [[hot adult contemporary]] format over the years. WVBF also had many different nicknames in that era, including ''WVBF FM 105'', ''WVBF Stereo 105'', ''F105 WVBF'' and ''The New WVBF Boston 105''.\n\nWVBF debuted a morning show in 1981 hosted by the team of Loren Owens and Wally Brine; eventually joined on-air by [[character actor]]/[[Parody music|parody musician]] Tom Doyle, newscaster Lauren Beckham Falcone, traffic reporter Hank Morse and producer Brian \"Lung Boy\" Bell.

Confusion with other FM stations and [[WCVB-TV]] led to a call sign change to WKLB in 1995.\n\nIn 1995, WKLB was to be sold to Evergreen Media, and was widely expected to become a talk station. However, a series of subsequent trades in 1996 placed WKLB under common ownership with WBCS via Greater Media.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/403763793.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+15%2C+1996&author=Bickelhaupt%2C+Susan&pub=Boston+Globe&edition=&startpage=23&desc=WBCS-FM+owners+to+take+over+WKLB-FM/ WBCS-FM owners to take over WKLB-FM], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', June 15, 1996</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 1996, the intellectual property of WKLB \"merged\" with WBCS, with the newly merged country station utilizing the 96.9 frequency of WBCS along with the WKLB call letters, combining personalities from both stations.

The two stations simulcast for eleven days.\n\n===WROR (1996-present)===\nAfter the simulcast ended, on September 5, 1996, Greater Media changed WKLB's call letters to WROR, and changed the station's format to [[oldies]].<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/290798345.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+5%2C+1996&author=Bickelhaupt%2C+Susan&pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&edition=&startpage=E.8&desc=%27ROR-FM+back+in+letter+and+spirit/ ROR-FM back in letter and spirit], ''Boston Globe'', September 5, 1996</ref> The WROR callsign had previously been used on [[WBZ-FM|98.5 FM]] until 1991, later being been \"[[Domain parking|parked]]\" first on [[WMFN|WMFN (640 AM)]] in [[Zeeland, Michigan]], then on [[WWDJ|WROR (1150 AM)]]; the latter was also owned by Greater Media at the time.\n\nThe \"new\" WROR played 1970s pop and rock oldies, [[disco]], some 1960s oldies, 1980s soft rock and top-40 crossovers, along with some [[classic rock]], and hired several staffers connected to the \"old\" WROR. Leading broadcasters involved with WROR in the 1970s and early 1980s included program director [[Gary Berkowitz]] and personalities such as: Joe Martell, Phil Redo, Larry Justice, Frank Kingston Smith, and current WROR General Manager Tom Baker.\n\nBy 1999, the format had been modified to classic rock, similar to co-owned [[WMGK]] in [[Philadelphia]], but gradually moved back to more of a pop-based classic hits format in 2006, emphasizing pop adult rock hits while mixing in some R&B, disco, and harder rock songs. The station continues to emphasize the 1970s and 1980s, but also plays some well-known 1960s and 1990s hits. WROR became the market's lone classic hits station in 2012 following [[WODS]]'s format switch to top 40.

Owens did his final show on June 28, 2019, citing an inability to reach terms on a contract extension.  WROR now has \"The ROR Morning Show\" as its wake-up program, hosted by Bob Bronson (formerly with [[WLTW]] [[New York City]] and [[WZID]] [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]) joined by Lauren Beckham Falcone as co-host and Brian Bell as producer.\n\nThe Loren & Wally Show had several segments:\n\n===Men from Maine===\n'''Men from Maine''' was a one- to two-minute comedy segment, opening with [[soap opera]] organ music and Loren stating something varying along the lines of, \"Welcome to another thrilling episode of the exciting adventures of Men from Maine. As today's action packed drama begins...\". Episodes typically revolve around the two main characters Lem (played by Tom) and Ephus (played by Wally), and other residents of [[Bangor, Maine]], such as Ephus' wife Effie and son Ephus Junior, Doc Cider (after Dock Sider shoes) and Pastor Fazool (after ''[[pasta e fagioli]]''). The same characters have been used in songs about Maine on the segment \"Tom's Townie Tunes\" (see below). The humor of the segment is at its root generic \"[[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] humor\", but set in very rural, backwoods Maine as opposed to the [[American South]]. Episode themes can run all the way from industrial accidents handled in incompetent ways (many residents, including Lem and Ephus work in the local [[sawmill]]), to bestiality. In all cases, the humor comes from the stupidity of the characters, and their obliviousness to it. Every episode ends with the characters going \"Ayuh!\"\n\nAt least one listener has found the show offensive, as heard on the first Men from Maine CD (sold during the holiday season to raise money for charity). Offended by the humor poking fun at her home state, a woman called the station, threatening to continue protesting the show until it is taken off the air. But the segment continued on the Loren and Wally show until Owens' departure from the program. Some can still be found as a \"Loren & Wally Podcast of the Day\" on iTunes and 2 episodes are posted on [[YouTube]].\n\n===Tom's Townie Tunes===\n'''Tom's Townie Tunes''' is a segment created by morning crew member Tom Doyle that spoofs [[classic rock]] hits, using humorous lyrics to poke fun at towns in Massachusetts (and an additional few songs about the surrounding region, such as Maine). Often the songs are about high crime rates, poverty, and the general misery of residents in low class areas, while other songs satirize [[Harvard]] graduates and [[Kerry Healey]]'s failed run for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of \"[[867-5309 (Jenny)]]\" by [[Tommy Tutone]]). The first ever Townie Tune was about [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of [[Funkytown]]).

WKOX-FM was the Boston area's first FM top 40 station featuring live [[disc jockey]]s, including hosts Bill Thomas, Brother Bill Heizer, FM Douglas, program director Dick Stevens, John Leisher, Alan Fraser, J. William Charles, with Kenny McKay and Jimmy Conlee.

After the sale, WKOX-FM became WVBF (also known as the ''Electronic Mama''), as a hybrid top 40/rock station, initially retaining some of the WKOX-FM personalities. The call letters officially stood for \"Welcome, Virginia Brown Fairbanks\", the wife of station owner Richard M. Fairbanks; Richard also had a station named after himself, [[WRMF]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. WVBF improved its signal coverage, targeting the [[Greater Boston]] area. Some hosts added to WVBF during their early months included Buddy Ballou, John \"Big John\" Gillis, Bill \"BLF Bash\" Freeman and Charlie Kendall.\n\nDuring Fairbanks ownership in the 1970s, WVBF evolved from being a high energy top 40/rock hybrid station in 1971/1972, to becoming a mainstream [[top 40]] station by 1975, and eventually evolved into a [[hot adult contemporary]] format over the years. WVBF also had many different nicknames in that era, including ''WVBF FM 105'', ''WVBF Stereo 105'', ''F105 WVBF'' and ''The New WVBF Boston 105''.\n\nWVBF debuted a morning show in 1981 hosted by the team of Loren Owens and Wally Brine; eventually joined on-air by [[character actor]]/[[Parody music|parody musician]] Tom Doyle, newscaster Lauren Beckham Falcone, traffic reporter Hank Morse and producer Brian \"Lung Boy\" Bell.

Leading broadcasters involved with WROR in the 1970s and early 1980s included program director [[Gary Berkowitz]] and personalities such as: Joe Martell, Phil Redo, Larry Justice, Frank Kingston Smith, and current WROR General Manager Tom Baker.\n\nBy 1999, the format had been modified to classic rock, similar to co-owned [[WMGK]] in [[Philadelphia]], but gradually moved back to more of a pop-based classic hits format in 2006, emphasizing pop adult rock hits while mixing in some R&B, disco, and harder rock songs. The station continues to emphasize the 1970s and 1980s, but also plays some well-known 1960s and 1990s hits.

The program aired on the station since 1981 (when it was still WVBF).<ref name=tbg-landw2001>{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Clea|title=Loren and Wally: 20 years on air|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8668570.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924201610/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8668570.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 24, 2015|accessdate=December 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=July 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2016, Wally Brine announced his retirement.<ref>http://wror.com/wally/#thanksservingb Wally Set To Retire His Alarm Clock! </ref>  Hank Morse was let go on June 24, 2019, a few days before the show concluded.  Owens did his final show on June 28, 2019, citing an inability to reach terms on a contract extension.  WROR now has \"The ROR Morning Show\" as its wake-up program, hosted by Bob Bronson (formerly with [[WLTW]] [[New York City]] and [[WZID]] [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]) joined by Lauren Beckham Falcone as co-host and Brian Bell as producer.\n\nThe Loren & Wally Show had several segments:\n\n===Men from Maine===\n'''Men from Maine''' was a one- to two-minute comedy segment, opening with [[soap opera]] organ music and Loren stating something varying along the lines of, \"Welcome to another thrilling episode of the exciting adventures of Men from Maine. As today's action packed drama begins...\". Episodes typically revolve around the two main characters Lem (played by Tom) and Ephus (played by Wally), and other residents of [[Bangor, Maine]], such as Ephus' wife Effie and son Ephus Junior, Doc Cider (after Dock Sider shoes) and Pastor Fazool (after ''[[pasta e fagioli]]''). The same characters have been used in songs about Maine on the segment \"Tom's Townie Tunes\" (see below). The humor of the segment is at its root generic \"[[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] humor\", but set in very rural, backwoods Maine as opposed to the [[American South]]. Episode themes can run all the way from industrial accidents handled in incompetent ways (many residents, including Lem and Ephus work in the local [[sawmill]]), to bestiality. In all cases, the humor comes from the stupidity of the characters, and their obliviousness to it. Every episode ends with the characters going \"Ayuh!\"\n\nAt least one listener has found the show offensive, as heard on the first Men from Maine CD (sold during the holiday season to raise money for charity). Offended by the humor poking fun at her home state, a woman called the station, threatening to continue protesting the show until it is taken off the air. But the segment continued on the Loren and Wally show until Owens' departure from the program. Some can still be found as a \"Loren & Wally Podcast of the Day\" on iTunes and 2 episodes are posted on [[YouTube]].\n\n===Tom's Townie Tunes===\n'''Tom's Townie Tunes''' is a segment created by morning crew member Tom Doyle that spoofs [[classic rock]] hits, using humorous lyrics to poke fun at towns in Massachusetts (and an additional few songs about the surrounding region, such as Maine). Often the songs are about high crime rates, poverty, and the general misery of residents in low class areas, while other songs satirize [[Harvard]] graduates and [[Kerry Healey]]'s failed run for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of \"[[867-5309 (Jenny)]]\" by [[Tommy Tutone]]). The first ever Townie Tune was about [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of [[Funkytown]]). Doyle's sports-related songs have occasionally gained airplay on other stations during championship seasons. During the holiday season, Tom often sings parodies of classic Christmas songs.\n\nOther Townie Tunes include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Townie Tune\n!

Just before the Nazi German [[invasion of Poland]], Jews supported the Polish government fund-raising for Air Defence (Dz.U.R.P.Nr 26, poz. 176) much more generously than average Torunians. The German army entered the city on September 7, 1939. By the end of November the city was declared ''Judenfrei'', with several hundred Jews who chose to stay, deported to the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto]] and other locations in the ''Warthegau''.<ref name=\"kirkuty\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kirkuty.xip.pl/torun_zydzi.htm |title=Zarys historii Torunskiej mniejszosci \u017bydowskiej (History of Jews in Torun) |publisher=Cmentarze \u017bydowskie w Polsce |work=\u017bydzi z Torunia |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-06-16 |author=Maciej Ko\u0142yszko}}</ref> [[Nazi Germany]] annexed the city, and administered it as part of [[Danzig-West Prussia]].  Poles were classified as [[Untermenschen]] by German authorities, with their fate being slave-labor, executions and [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|expulsions]]. {{details|Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany}}\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Germans used the chain of forts surrounding the city as [[POW]] camps, known collectively as [[Stalag XX-A]]. The city escaped significant destruction during the war. In 1945 it was taken by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]]. The remaining ethnic German population was [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forcibly expelled]], primarily to [[East Germany]], between 1945 and 1947.\n\nAfter World War II, the population increased more than twofold and industry developed significantly. The founding of the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru\u0144|Nicolaus Copernicus University]] in 1945 was significant. Over the years, it has become one of the best universities in Poland. The university has strongly influenced the intellectual, artistic and cultural life of the city, as well as its perception by non-locals. The university was founded by Polish professors formerly associated with the [[Vilnius University|University of Wilno]]. After the war, they were forced to move to post-1945 Poland.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Population \n!
