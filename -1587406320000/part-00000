PlayStation 3 controllers are supported as well, although only in some cabinets. Outside of a major leap in visuals, updates include 300 added motions, the ability to dribble in all directions, and an update in team count to around 230. New systems include the Icon Chat System for simple communication during matches, and a Real Time Player Substitution system which lets you specify player substitutions whenever you like.

Following the match, the game gives you a \"Sychro Rate,\" indicating your compatibility. Konami will be holding an in-game tournament using the Competition Mode to coincide with the UEFA Champions League tournament.

Outside of a major leap in visuals, updates include 300 added motions, the ability to dribble in all directions, and an update in team count to around 230.

Following the match, the game gives you a \"Sychro Rate,\" indicating your compatibility.

Its weak [[acidity]] ([[Acid dissociation constant|pK<sub>a</sub>]] around 6) is due to the numerous  [[phenol]] groups in the structure. The [[chemical formula]] for commercial tannic acid is often given as C<sub>76</sub>H<sub>52</sub>O<sub>46</sub>, which corresponds with decagalloyl glucose, but in fact it is a mixture of polygalloyl glucoses or polygalloyl quinic acid esters with the number of galloyl moieties per molecule ranging from 2 up to 12 depending on the plant source used to extract the tannic acid. Commercial tannic acid is usually extracted from any of the following plant parts: Tara pods (''[[Caesalpinia spinosa]]''), gallnuts from ''[[Rhus semialata]]'' or ''[[Quercus infectoria]]'' or Sicilian sumac leaves (''[[Rhus coriaria]]'').\n\nAccording to the definitions provided in external references such as international pharmacopoeia, [[Food Chemicals Codex]] and FAO-WHO tannic acid monograph only tannins sourced from the above-mentioned plants can be considered as tannic acid. Sometimes extracts from [[chestnut]] or [[oak]] wood are also described as tannic acid but this is an incorrect use of the term. It is a yellow to light brown [[amorphous]] powder; 2850 [[gram]]s dissolves in one [[litre]] of water (1.7 [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s per liter).\n\nWhile tannic acid is a specific type of [[tannin]] (plant polyphenol), the two terms are sometimes (incorrectly) used interchangeably. The long-standing misuse of the terms, and its inclusion in scholarly articles has compounded the confusion. This is particularly widespread in relation to green tea and black tea, both of which contain tannin but not tannic acid.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.432625 |title=Darvon safety |year=1979 |last1=Pettinga |first1=C. |journal=Science |volume=204 |issue=4388 |pages=6 |pmid=432625 |bibcode=1979Sci...204....6P}}</ref>\n\nTannic acid is not an appropriate standard for any type of tannin analysis because of its poorly defined composition.\n\n== Quercitannic and gallotannic acids ==\n\n'''[[Quercitannic acid]]''' is one of the two forms of tannic acid<ref>{{cite book|title=L'Energie Homo-Hydrogne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVoi7qnjYMQC&pg=PA248|year=2004|publisher=Editions Publibook|isbn=978-2-7483-0811-2|pages=248\u2013}}</ref> found in [[oak bark]] and leaves.<ref>[http://www.henriettes-herb.com/eclectic/bpc1911/quercus.html ''Quercus'']. henriettes-herb.com</ref> The other form is called [[gallotannic acid]] and is found in oak galls.\n\nThe quercitannic acid molecule is also present in [[quercitron]], a yellow dye obtained from the bark of the Eastern black oak (''Quercus velutina''), a forest tree indigenous in North America.

Acheson (Inventor of Carborundum) discovered that gallotannic acid greatly improved the plasticity of clay. In his report of this discovery in 1904 he noted that the only known historical reference to the use of organic material added to clay is the use of straw mixed with clay described in the Bible, Exodus 1:11 and that the Egyptians must have been aware of his (re-)discovery. He stated \"This explains why the straw was used and why the children of Israel were successful in substituting stubble for straw, a course that would hardly be possible, were the fibre of the straw depended upon as a bond feasible for the clay, but quite reasonable where the extract of the plant was used.\"<ref>Acheson, Edward G. (1904) \"Egyptianized Clay\" in ''Transactions of the American Ceramic Society''. pp. 31\u201365.</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}\nTannins are a basic ingredient in the chemical staining of [[wood]], and are already present in woods like [[oak]], [[walnut]], and [[mahogany]]. Tannic acid can be applied to woods low in tannin so chemical stains that require tannin content will react. The presence of tannins in the bark of [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood (''Sequoia)'']] is a strong natural defense against [[wildfire]], [[decomposition]] and infestation by certain insects such as [[termite]]s. It is found in the [[seeds]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[conifer cone|cones]], and [[heartwood]].\n\nTannic acid is a common [[mordant]] used in the dyeing process for [[cellulose]] fibers such as [[cotton]], often combined with [[alum]] and/or [[iron]]. The tannin mordant should be done first as metal mordants combine well with the fiber-tannin complex. However this use has lost considerable interest.\n\nSimilarly tannic acid can also be used as an aftertreatment to improve wash fastness properties of acid dyed [[polyamide]]. It is also an alternative for fluorcarbon aftertreatments to impart anti-staining properties to polyamide yarn or carpets.\nHowever, due to economic considerations currently the only widespread use as textile auxiliary is the use as an agent to improve chlorine fastness, i.e. resistance against dye bleaching due to cleaning with hypochlorite solutions in high-end polyamide 6,6-based carpets and swimwear. It is, however, used in relatively small quantities for the activation of [[upholstery]] flock; this serves as an anti-[[Static electricity|static]] treatment.\n\nTannic acid is used in the conservation of ferrous (iron based) metal objects to passivate and inhibit corrosion. Tannic acid reacts with the corrosion products to form a more stable compound, thus preventing further corrosion from taking place.  After treatment the tannic acid residue is generally left on the object so that if moisture reaches the surface the tannic acid will be rehydrated and prevent or slow any corrosion.  Tannic acid treatment for conservation is very effective and widely used but it does have a significant visual effect on the object, turning the corrosion products black and any exposed metal dark blue.  It should also be used with care on objects with copper alloy components as the tannic acid can have a slight etching effect on these metals.\n\nTannic acid is also found in commercially available iron/steel [[Rust converter|corrosion treatments]], such as Hammerite Kurust.\n\n===Use in food===\n\nUse of tannic acid in food applications is widespread; significant amounts are used as process aids in beer clarification, aroma compound in soft drinks and juices. Also important are applications in the wine industry, where it finds use as a natural clarifying agent, colour stabilizer and taste enhancer.\n\nIn many parts of the world, such uses are permitted. In the [[United States]], tannic acid is [[generally recognized as safe]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration]].\n\nAccording to [[Directive (European Union)|EU directive]] 89/107/EEC tannic acid cannot be considered as a [[food additive]] and consequently does not hold an [[E number]]. Under directive 89/107/EEC tannic acid can be referred to as a food ingredient. The E-number E181 is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to tannic acid; this in fact refers to the [[INS number]] assigned to tannic acid under the FAO-WHO Codex Alimentarius system.\n\n===Uses as a medication===\n\nIn conjunction with magnesium and sometimes activated charcoal, tannic acid was once used as a treatment for many toxic substances, such as [[strychnine]], mushroom, and ptomaine poisonings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sturmer |first=J.

Its weak [[acidity]] ([[Acid dissociation constant|pK<sub>a</sub>]] around 6) is due to the numerous  [[phenol]] groups in the structure. The [[chemical formula]] for commercial tannic acid is often given as C<sub>76</sub>H<sub>52</sub>O<sub>46</sub>, which corresponds with decagalloyl glucose, but in fact it is a mixture of polygalloyl glucoses or polygalloyl quinic acid esters with the number of galloyl moieties per molecule ranging from 2 up to 12 depending on the plant source used to extract the tannic acid. Commercial tannic acid is usually extracted from any of the following plant parts: Tara pods (''[[Caesalpinia spinosa]]''), gallnuts from ''[[Rhus semialata]]'' or ''[[Quercus infectoria]]'' or Sicilian Sumac leaves (''[[Rhus coriaria]]'').\n\nAccording to the definitions provided in external references such as international pharmacopoeia, [[Food Chemicals Codex]] and FAO-WHO tannic acid monograph only tannins sourced from the above-mentioned plants can be considered as tannic acid. Sometimes extracts from [[chestnut]] or [[oak]] wood are also described as tannic acid but this is an incorrect use of the term. It is a yellow to light brown [[amorphous]] powder; 2850 [[gram]]s dissolves in one [[litre]] of water (1.7 [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s per liter).\n\nWhile tannic acid is a specific type of [[tannin]] (plant polyphenol), the two terms are sometimes (incorrectly) used interchangeably. The long-standing misuse of the terms, and its inclusion in scholarly articles has compounded the confusion. This is particularly widespread in relation to green tea and black tea, both of which contain tannin but not tannic acid.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.432625 |title=Darvon safety |year=1979 |last1=Pettinga |first1=C. |journal=Science |volume=204 |issue=4388 |pages=6 |pmid=432625 |bibcode=1979Sci...204....6P}}</ref>\n\nTannic acid is not an appropriate standard for any type of tannin analysis because of its poorly defined composition.\n\n== Quercitannic and gallotannic acids ==\n\n'''[[Quercitannic acid]]''' is one of the two forms of tannic acid<ref>{{cite book|title=L'Energie Homo-Hydrogne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVoi7qnjYMQC&pg=PA248|year=2004|publisher=Editions Publibook|isbn=978-2-7483-0811-2|pages=248\u2013}}</ref> found in [[oak bark]] and leaves.<ref>[http://www.henriettes-herb.com/eclectic/bpc1911/quercus.html ''Quercus'']. henriettes-herb.com</ref> The other form is called [[gallotannic acid]] and is found in oak galls.\n\nThe quercitannic acid molecule is also present in [[quercitron]], a yellow dye obtained from the bark of the Eastern black oak (''Quercus velutina''), a forest tree indigenous in North America.

Acheson (Inventor of Carborundum) discovered that gallotannic acid greatly improved the plasticity of clay. In his report of this discovery in 1904 he noted that the only known historical reference to the use of organic material added to clay is the use of straw mixed with clay described in the Bible, Exodus 1:11 and that the Egyptians must have been aware of his (re-)discovery. He stated \"This explains why the straw was used and why the children of Israel were successful in substituting stubble for straw, a course that would hardly be possible, were the fibre of the straw depended upon as a bond feasible for the clay, but quite reasonable where the extract of the plant was used.\"<ref>Acheson, Edward G. (1904) \"Egyptianized Clay\" in ''Transactions of the American Ceramic Society''. pp. 31\u201365.</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}\nTannins are a basic ingredient in the chemical staining of [[wood]], and are already present in woods like [[oak]], [[walnut]], and [[mahogany]]. Tannic acid can be applied to woods low in tannin so chemical stains that require tannin content will react. The presence of tannins in the bark of [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood (''Sequoia)'']] is a strong natural defense against [[wildfire]], [[decomposition]] and infestation by certain insects such as [[termite]]s. It is found in the [[seeds]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[conifer cone|cones]], and [[heartwood]].\n\nTannic acid is a common [[mordant]] used in the dyeing process for [[cellulose]] fibers such as [[cotton]], often combined with [[alum]] and/or [[iron]]. The tannin mordant should be done first as metal mordants combine well with the fiber-tannin complex. However this use has lost considerable interest.\n\nSimilarly tannic acid can also be used as an aftertreatment to improve wash fastness properties of acid dyed [[polyamide]]. It is also an alternative for fluorcarbon aftertreatments to impart anti-staining properties to polyamide yarn or carpets.\nHowever, due to economic considerations currently the only widespread use as textile auxiliary is the use as an agent to improve chlorine fastness, i.e. resistance against dye bleaching due to cleaning with hypochlorite solutions in high-end polyamide 6,6-based carpets and swimwear. It is, however, used in relatively small quantities for the activation of [[upholstery]] flock; this serves as an anti-[[Static electricity|static]] treatment.\n\nTannic acid is used in the conservation of ferrous (iron based) metal objects to passivate and inhibit corrosion. Tannic acid reacts with the corrosion products to form a more stable compound, thus preventing further corrosion from taking place.  After treatment the tannic acid residue is generally left on the object so that if moisture reaches the surface the tannic acid will be rehydrated and prevent or slow any corrosion.  Tannic acid treatment for conservation is very effective and widely used but it does have a significant visual effect on the object, turning the corrosion products black and any exposed metal dark blue.  It should also be used with care on objects with copper alloy components as the tannic acid can have a slight etching effect on these metals.\n\nTannic acid is also found in commercially available iron/steel [[Rust converter|corrosion treatments]], such as Hammerite Kurust.\n\n===Use in food===\n\nUse of tannic acid in food applications is widespread; significant amounts are used as process aids in beer clarification, aroma compound in soft drinks and juices. Also important are applications in the wine industry, where it finds use as a natural clarifying agent, colour stabilizer and taste enhancer.\n\nIn many parts of the world, such uses are permitted. In the [[United States]], tannic acid is [[generally recognized as safe]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration]].\n\nAccording to [[Directive (European Union)|EU directive]] 89/107/EEC tannic acid cannot be considered as a [[food additive]] and consequently does not hold an [[E number]]. Under directive 89/107/EEC tannic acid can be referred to as a food ingredient. The E-number E181 is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to tannic acid; this in fact refers to the [[INS number]] assigned to tannic acid under the FAO-WHO Codex Alimentarius system.\n\n===Uses as a medication===\n\nIn conjunction with magnesium and sometimes activated charcoal, tannic acid was once used as a treatment for many toxic substances, such as [[strychnine]], mushroom, and ptomaine poisonings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sturmer |first=J.

This would mean that the families of Atat\u00fcrk's parents were interrelated. Cemil Bozok also notes that his paternal grandfather, Safer Efendi, was of Albanian origin. This may have a bearing on the vexed question of Atat\u00fcrk's ethnic origin. Atat\u00fcrk's parents and relatives all used Turkish as their mother tongue.

Britain, which controlled the [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman provinces of Egypt and Sudan]], did not allow additional Ottoman troops to reach Libya through Egypt. Ottoman soldiers like Atat\u00fcrk went to Libya either dressed as Arabs (risking imprisonment if noticed by the British authorities in Egypt) or by the very few available ferries (the Italians, who had superior naval forces, effectively controlled the sea routes to Tripoli). However, despite all the hardships, Atat\u00fcrk's forces in Libya managed to repel the Italians on a number of occasions, such as the [[Battle of Tobruk (1911)|Battle of Tobruk]] on 22 December 1911. During the Battle of Derna on 16\u201317 January 1912, while Atat\u00fcrk was assaulting the Italian-controlled fortress of Kasr-\u0131 Harun, two Italian planes dropped bombs on the Ottoman forces; a [[limestone]] splinter from a damaged building's rubble struck Atat\u00fcrk's left eye, causing permanent tissue damage, but not total loss of sight. He received medical treatment for nearly a month; he attempted to leave the Red Crescent's health facilities after only two weeks, but when his eye's situation worsened, he had to return and resume treatment. On 6 March 1912 Atat\u00fcrk became the Commander of the Ottoman forces in Derna. He managed to defend and retain the city and its surrounding region until the end of the Italo-Turkish War on 18 October 1912. Atat\u00fcrk, [[\u0130smail Enver|Enver Bey]], [[Ali Fethi Okyar|Fethi Bey]], and the other Ottoman military commanders in Libya had to return to [[Ottoman territories in Europe|Ottoman Europe]] following the outbreak of the [[Balkan Wars]] on 8 October 1912.

This defining ideology of the Republic of Turkey is referred to as the \"Six Arrows\", or [[Kemalist ideology]].

In forging the new republic, the Turkish revolutionaries turned their back on the perceived corruption and decadence of cosmopolitan Constantinople and its Ottoman heritage.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 391\u2013392</ref> For instance, they made Angora,<!--Turkish names of cities began to be used in English after 1930--> [[Ankara]] in Turkish, the country's new capital and reformed the [[Postage stamps and postal history of Turkey|Turkish postal service]]. Once a provincial town deep in Anatolia, Angora was thus turned into the center of the independence movement. Atat\u00fcrk wanted a \"direct government by the Assembly\"<ref name=\"Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 362\">Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 362</ref> and visualized a [[representative democracy]], [[parliamentary sovereignty]], where the National Parliament would be the ultimate source of power.<ref name=\"Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 362\"/>\n\nIn the following years, he altered his stance somewhat; the country needed an immense amount of reconstruction, and that \"direct government by the Assembly\" could not survive in such an environment. The revolutionaries faced challenges from the supporters of the old Ottoman regime, and also from the supporters of newer ideologies such as communism and fascism. Atat\u00fcrk saw the consequences of fascist and communist doctrines in the 1920s and 1930s and rejected both.<ref>Landau, ''Atat\u00fcrk and the Modernization of Turkey'', 252</ref> He prevented the spread into Turkey of the [[totalitarian]] party rule which held sway in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 501</ref> Some perceived his opposition and silencing of these ideologies as a means of eliminating competition; others believed it was necessary to protect the young Turkish state from succumbing to the instability of new ideologies and competing factions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Under Atat\u00fcrk, the arrest process known as the Arrests of 1927 (''1927 Tevkifat\u0131'') was launched, and a widespread arrest policy was put in place against the [[Communist Party of Turkey (historical)|Communist Party of Turkey]] members.

Education was the cornerstone in this effort. In 1923, there were three main educational groups of institutions. The most common institutions were [[medrese]]s based on Arabic, the Qur'an and memorization. The second type of institution was idad\u00ee and sultan\u00ee, the reformist schools of the [[Tanzimat]] era. The last group included colleges and minority schools in foreign languages that used the latest teaching models in educating pupils. The old medrese education was modernized.<ref name=dew/> Atat\u00fcrk changed the classical Islamic education for a vigorously promoted reconstruction of educational institutions.<ref name=dew/> He linked educational reform to the liberation of the nation from [[dogma]], which he believed was more important than the Turkish War of Independence.

He wanted to institute compulsory primary education for both girls and boys; since then this effort has been an ongoing task for the republic. He pointed out that one of the main targets of [[education in Turkey]] had to be raising a generation nourished with what he called the \"public culture\". The state schools established a common curriculum which became known as the \"unification of education.\"\n\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Atat\u00fcrk with his [[bowler hat]]]]\n\nUnification of education was put into force on 3 March 1924 by the Law on Unification of Education (No. 430). With the new law, education became inclusive, organized on a model of the civil community. In this new design, all schools submitted their curriculum to the \"[[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]]\", a government agency modelled after other countries' ministries of education. Concurrently, the republic abolished the two ministries and made clergy subordinate to the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|department of religious affairs]], one of the foundations of [[secularism in Turkey]]. The unification of education under one curriculum ended \"clerics or clergy of the Ottoman Empire\", but was not the end of religious schools in Turkey; they were moved to higher education until later governments restored them to their former position in secondary after Atat\u00fcrk's death.\n\n[[File:Ataturk-hatreform.jpg|thumb|upright|Atat\u00fcrk with his [[Panama hat]] just after [[s:tr:Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Kastamonu Nutku|the Kastamonu speech]] in 1925]]\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1925, Atat\u00fcrk encouraged the Turks to wear modern European attire.<ref name=UNESCO>\u0130\u011fdemir, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 165\u2013170</ref> He was determined to force the abandonment of the sartorial traditions of the Middle East and finalize a series of dress reforms, which were originally started by [[Mahmud II]].<ref name=UNESCO/> The [[Fez (hat)|fez]] was established by Sultan Mahmud II in 1826 as part of the Ottoman Empire's modernization effort. The [[s:tr:\u015eapka \u0130ktisas\u0131 Hakk\u0131nda Kanun|Hat Law of 1925]] introduced the use of Western-style hats instead of the fez. Atat\u00fcrk first made the hat compulsory for civil servants.<ref name=UNESCO/> The guidelines for the proper dressing of students and state employees were passed during his lifetime; many civil servants adopted the hat willingly. In 1925, Atat\u00fcrk wore a [[Panama hat]] during a public appearance in [[Kastamonu]], one of the most conservative towns in Anatolia, to explain that the hat was the headgear of civilized nations. The last part of reform on dress emphasized the need to wear modern Western suits with neckties as well as Fedora and Derby-style hats instead of antiquated religion-based clothing such as the veil and turban in the [[s:tr:Baz\u0131 Kisvelerin Giyilemiyece\u011fine Dair Kanun|Law Relating to Prohibited Garments of 1934]].\n\nEven though he personally promoted modern dress for women, Atat\u00fcrk never made specific reference to women's clothing in the law, as he believed that women would adapt to the new clothing styles of their own free will. He was frequently photographed on public business with his wife [[L\u00e2tife U\u015fakl\u0131gil]], who covered her head in accordance with Islamic tradition. He was also frequently photographed on public business with women wearing modern Western clothes. But it was Atat\u00fcrk's adopted daughters, [[Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en]] and [[Afet \u0130nan]], who provided the real role model for the Turkish women of the future. He wrote: \"The religious covering of women will not cause difficulty ...

This speech also had another position. He said: {{bquote|In the face of knowledge, science, and of the whole extent of radiant civilization, I cannot accept the presence in Turkey's civilized community of people primitive enough to seek material and spiritual benefits in the guidance of sheiks.

Sheikh Said was a wealthy Kurdish [[tribal chief]] of a local [[Naqshbandi]] order. He emphasized the issue of religion; he not only opposed the abolition of the Caliphate, but also the adoption of civil codes based on Western models, the closure of religious orders, the ban on polygamy, and the new obligatory civil marriage. Sheikh stirred up his followers against the policies of the government, which he considered anti-Islamic. In an effort to restore Islamic law, Sheik's forces moved through the countryside, seized government offices and marched on the important cities of [[Elaz\u0131\u011f]] and [[Diyarbak\u0131r]].<ref>Patrick Kinross, ''Atat\u00fcrk: The Rebirth of a Nation'', 397</ref> Members of the government saw the Sheikh Said Rebellion as an attempt at a counter-revolution. They urged immediate military action to prevent its spread. The \"Law for the Maintenance of Public Order\" was passed to deal with the rebellion on 4 March 1925. It gave the government exceptional powers and included the authority to shut down subversive groups, but was repealed on 4 March 1929.\n\nThere were also parliamentarians in the GNA who were not happy with these changes{{who|date=September 2015}}. So many members were denounced as opposition sympathizers at a private meeting of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) that Atat\u00fcrk expressed his fear of being among the minority in his own party.<ref name=\"PRP\">Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 418</ref> He decided not to purge this group.<ref name=\"PRP\"/> After a [[Censure|censure motion]] gave the chance to have a breakaway group, [[Kaz\u0131m Karabekir]], along with his friends, established such a group on 17 October 1924.

The PRP's economic program suggested liberalism, in contrast to the [[state socialism]] of CHP, and its social program was based on conservatism in contrast to the [[modernism]] of CHP. Leaders of the party strongly supported the Kemalist revolution in principle, but had different opinions on the cultural revolution and the principle of [[secularism]].<ref>Weiker, ''Book Review of Z\u00fcrcher's \"Political Opposition in the Early Turkish Republic: The Progressive Republican Party, 1924\u20131925\"'', 297\u2013298</ref> The PRP was not against Atat\u00fcrk's main positions as declared in its program; they supported establishing secularism in the country and the civil law, or as stated, \"the needs of the age\" (article 3) and the uniform system of education (article 49).<ref name=\"Mango 419\">Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 419</ref> These principles were set by the leaders at the onset.

It originated with a former deputy who had opposed the abolition of the Caliphate. Investigation shifted from an inquiry into the planners to an investigation ostensibly to uncover subversive activities but in truth used to undermine those disagreeing with Atat\u00fcrk's cultural revolution. The sweeping investigation brought a number of political activists before the tribunal, including Karabekir, the leader of PRP. A number of surviving leaders of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], who were at best second-rank in the Turkish movement, including [[Mehmet Cavit Bey|Cavid]], Ahmed \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc, and Ismail Canbulat, were found guilty of treason and hanged.<ref>Touraj Atabaki, Erik Jan Z\u00fcrcher, 2004, Men of Order: authoritarian modernization under Atat\u00fcrk and Reza Shah, I.B.Tauris, {{ISBN|1-86064-426-0}}, page 207</ref> The investigations found a link between the members of the PRP and the Sheikh Said Rebellion.

Atat\u00fcrk began developing social reforms very early, as was evident in his personal journal. He and his staff discussed issues like abolishing the [[Hijab|veiling of women]] and the integration of women into the outside world. The clue on how he was planning to tackle the issue was stated in his journal in November 1915:\n\n{{bquote|The social change can come by (1) educating capable mothers who are knowledgeable about life; (2) giving freedom to women; (3) a man can change his morals, thoughts, and feelings by leading a common life with a woman; as there is an inborn tendency towards the attraction of mutual affection.<ref name=mango164>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 164</ref>}}\n\nAtat\u00fcrk needed a new civil code to establish his second major step of giving freedom to women. The first part was the education of girls and was established with the unification of education. On 4 October 1926, the new Turkish civil code passed. It was modelled after the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. Under the new code, women gained equality with men in such matters as inheritance and divorce. Atat\u00fcrk did not consider gender a factor in social organization. According to his view, society marched towards its goal with men and women united.

The museum highlighted sculpture, which was little practised in Turkey owing to the Islamic tradition of avoiding idolatry. Atat\u00fcrk believed that \"culture is the foundation of the Turkish Republic,\"<ref name=atillasoy15>Atillasoy, ''Atat\u00fcrk : first president and founder of the Turkish Republic'', 15</ref> and described modern Turkey's ideological thrust as \"a creation of patriotism blended with a lofty humanist ideal.\" He included both his own nation's creative legacy and what he saw as the admirable values of global civilization. The pre-Islamic [[Turkic peoples|culture of the Turks]] became the subject of extensive research, and particular emphasis was laid upon Turkish culture widespread before the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] civilizations. He instigated study of [[History of Anatolia|Anatolian civilizations]]\u2014[[Phrygians]] and [[Lydians]], [[Sumer]]ians and [[Hittites]]. To attract current public attention to past cultures, he personally named the \"[[S\u00fcmerbank]]\" (1932) after the Sumerians and the \"[[Etibank]]\" (1935) after the Hittites.

On 1 November 1928, he introduced the new Turkish alphabet and abolished the use of Arabic script. At the time, literate citizens of the country comprised as little as 10% of the population.

He instigated official education meetings called \"Science Boards\" and \"Education Summits.\" to discuss the quality of education, training issues and certain basic educational principles. He said, \"our schools [curriculum] should aim to provide opportunities for all pupils to learn and to achieve.\" He was personally engaged with the development of two textbooks. The first one was ''{{lang-tr|Vatanda\u015f \u0130\u00e7in Medeni Bilgiler}}'' (1930). The second, ''Geometry'' (1937), was a text for high schools. The ''Vatanda\u015f \u0130\u00e7in Medeni Bilgiler'' (''Civic knowledge for the citizens'') introduced the science of comparative government and explained the means of administering public trust by explaining the rules of governance as applied to the new state institutions.\n\n====Opposition to Mustafa Kemal in 1930\u20131931====\n[[File:Ataturk and Fethi Okyar.jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk with the [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] leader [[Ali Fethi Okyar]] and his daughter in [[Yalova]], on 13 August 1930]]\nOn 11 August 1930, Atat\u00fcrk decided to try a multiparty movement once again and asked Ali Fethi Okyar to establish a new party. He insisted on the protection of secular reforms. The brand-new [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] succeeded all around the country. Without the establishment of a real political spectrum, once again, the party became the center to opposition of Atat\u00fcrk's reforms, particularly in regard to the role of religion in public life.\n\nOn 23 December 1930, a chain of violent incidents occurred, starting with the rebellion of Islamic fundamentalists in [[Menemen]], a small town in the Aegean region. This so-called [[Menemen Incident]] was considered a serious threat against secular reforms.\n\nIn November 1930, Ali Fethi Okyar dissolved his own party. A more lasting [[multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey]] began in 1945. In 1950, the CHP released the majority position to the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, historical)|Democratic Party]]. There are arguments that Atat\u00fcrk's single-party rule did not promote [[direct democracy]]. The reason experiments with [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] failed during this period was that not all groups in the country had agreed to a minimal consensus regarding shared values (mainly secularism) and shared rules for conflict resolution. In response to such criticisms, Atat\u00fcrk's biographer [[Andrew Mango]] said: \"between the two wars, democracy could not be sustained in many relatively richer and better-educated societies. Atat\u00fcrk's enlightened authoritarianism left a reasonable space for free private lives. More could not have been expected in his lifetime.\"<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 536</ref> Even though, at times, he did not appear to be a democrat in his actions, he always supported the idea of building a [[civil society]]: a system of voluntary civic and social organizations and institutions as opposed to the force-backed structures of the state. In one of his many speeches about the importance of democracy, Atat\u00fcrk said in 1933:\n\n{{bquote|Republic means the democratic administration of the state.

During the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], [[Lieutenant General]] [[William Marshall (British Army officer)|William Marshall]] followed the British War Office's instruction that \"every effort was to be made to score as heavily as possible on the Tigris before the whistle blew\", capturing Mosul three days after the signature of the [[Armistice of Mudros]] (30 October 1918).<ref name=\"britainsoil\">Peter Sluglett, \"The Primacy of Oil in Britain's Iraq Policy\", in the book \"Britain in Iraq: 1914\u20131932\" London: Ithaca Press, 1976, pp. 103\u2013116</ref> In 1920, the ''[[Misak-\u0131 Milli]]'', which consolidated the \"Turkish lands\", declared that Mosul Province was a part of the historic Turkish heartland. The British were in a precarious situation with the Issue of Mosul and were adopting almost equally desperate measures to protect their interests. The [[Iraqi revolt against the British]] was put down by the [[RAF Iraq Command]] during the summer of 1920. From the British perspective, if Atat\u00fcrk stabilized Turkey, he would then turn his attention to Mosul and penetrate Mesopotamia, where the native population would probably join him thus bringing an insurgent and hostile Muslim nation to the very gates of India.\n\nIn 1923, Atat\u00fcrk tried to persuade the GNA that accepting the arbitration of the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] over Mosul did not mean relinquishing Mosul, but rather waiting for a time when Turkey might be stronger. The artificially drawn border had an unsettling effect on the population on both sides. Later, it was claimed that Turkey began where the oil ends, as the border was drawn by the British geophysicists based on the oil reserves.

The relationship between the rebels and Britain was questioned. British assistance was sought after the rebels realised that the rebellion, or its expected outcome, could not stand by itself.<ref>Olson, Robert W. (1989) The Emergence of Kurdish Nationalism and the Sheikh Said Rebellion, 1880\u20131925, p.45</ref>\n\nIn 1925, the League of Nations formed a three-member committee to study the case while the Sheikh Said Rebellion was on the rise. Partly because of the continuing uncertainties along the northern frontier (present-day northern Iraq), the committee recommended that the region should be connected to Iraq with the condition that the UK would hold the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]. By the end of March 1925, the necessary troop movements were completed, and the whole area of the Sheikh Said rebellion was encircled.<ref>Kinross, 401</ref> As a result of these manoeuvres, the revolt was put down. Britain, Iraq and Kemal made a treaty on 5 June 1926, which mostly followed the decisions of the League Council. In 1926, Kemal faced growing opposition to his reform policies, a continuing precarious economic situation, and a defeat in the Mosul issue. A large section of the Kurdish population and the [[Iraqi Turkmen]] were left on the other side of the border. The Sheikh Said Rebellion hastened both the imposition of the Republican Party and the speed of Atat\u00fcrk's reforms. In 1925, the population was largely illiterate and disparate. Turkey was in ruins, reconstruction was difficult, poverty was everywhere and people were in pain, which fed separatist violence.<ref>ASD: Speeches and statements by Atat\u00fcrk, volume I pages 361\u2013363 published by Atat\u00fcrk Culture, language and history Higher Institute, Ankara 1989</ref> Rather than to a section of the population, Atat\u00fcrk attributed the rebellion to a group of notables, who  on 7 March 1925 were found guilty by the courts (kanunen mucrim olan bazi muteneffizan) and who used the mask of religion to conceal the interests of landlords, feudal tribal leaders and other \"reactionaries\".<ref name=mangokurds20>Andrew Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk and the Kurds'', Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.35, No.4, 1999, 20</ref>\n\n====Relations with the Russian SFSR/Soviet Union====\n{{See also|Russia\u2013Turkey relations#Turkey and the Soviet Union }}\n[[File:Diplomatic reception held in the Soviet Embassy in Ankara 1927 cropped.jpg|thumb|During a reception at the [[USSR]] Embassy in Ankara, on 7 November 1927]]\n[[File:Mustafa Kemal and Voroshilov on 29 October 1933.jpg|thumb|Exchanges on the concept of a Balkan Federation during the visit of [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], a vision of Kemal's which was never achieved]]\n\nIn his message to [[Vladimir Lenin]], the Bolshevik leader and head of the [[Russian SFSR]]'s government, dated 26 April 1920, Kemal promised to coordinate his military operations with the Bolsheviks' \"fight against [[imperialist]] governments\" and requested 5 million [[Turkish lira|lira]] in gold as well as armaments \"as first aid\" to his forces.<ref name=\"LetterLenin\">''\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c'' (the Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Foreign Minisrty]]'s magazine).

The war had devastated [[Aegean Region|Western Anatolia]], and the financial burden of [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Ottoman Muslim refugees]] from Greece blocked rapprochement.

Indeed, Venizelos' successor [[Panagis Tsaldaris]] came to visit Atat\u00fcrk in September 1933 and signed a more comprehensive agreement called the ''Entente Cordiale'' between Greece and Turkey, which was a stepping stone for the [[Balkan Pact]].\n\nGreek Premier [[Ioannis Metaxas]] said of Atat\u00fcrk and the Turkish-Greek alliance, that \"...Greece, which has the highest estimation of the renowned leader, heroic soldier, and enlightened creator of Turkey.

The treaty united the Afghan king's call for greater Oriental-Middle Eastern cooperation, Reza Shah's goal in securing relations with Turkey that would help Iran free itself from Soviet and British influence, and Atat\u00fcrk's foreign policy of securing stability in the region. The immediate outcome was to deter Mussolini from adventures in the region.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 510</ref>\n\n====Turkish Straits====\n[[File:King Edward VIII and President Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Atat\u00fcrk with King [[Edward VIII]] of the [[United Kingdom]] in [[Istanbul]], 4 September 1936]]\n\nOn 24 July 1923, the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] included the Lausanne Straits Agreement. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the [[Dardanelles]] should remain open to all commercial vessels: seizure of foreign military vessels was subject to certain limitations during peacetime, and, even as a neutral state, Turkey could not limit any military passage during wartime. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the waterway was to be demilitarized, and its management left to the Straits Commission. The demilitarized zone heavily restricted Turkey's domination and sovereignty over the Straits. The defence of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] was impossible without having the sovereignty over the water that passed through it.\n\nIn March 1936, Hitler's [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|reoccupation of the Rhineland]] gave Atat\u00fcrk the opportunity to resume full control over the Straits. \"The situation in Europe\", he declared \"is highly appropriate for such a move. We shall certainly achieve it\".<ref>Sosyal, Ismail, 1983, \"Turkey's Diplomatic treaties\", TTK, Ankara page 493</ref> [[Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras]], who was the foreign minister, initiated a move to revise the Straits' regime. Aras claimed that he was directed by the President, rather than his Prime Minister, \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc. \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc was worried about harming relations with Britain, France, and Balkan neighbors over the Straits. However, the signatories agreed to join the conference, since unlimited military passage had become unfavourable to Turkey with the changes in world politics. Atat\u00fcrk demanded that the members of the Turkish Foreign Office devise a solution that would transfer full control over the waterway to Turkey.\n\nOn 20 July 1936, the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits|Montreux Convention]] was signed, with the participation of Bulgaria, Great Britain, Australia, France, Japan, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Yugoslavia and Greece. It became the primary instrument governing the passage of commercial and war vessels through the Dardanelles Strait. It was ratified by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|GNAT]] on 31 July 1936. It went into effect on 9 November 1936 and is still valid today.\n\n====Balkan Pact====\n[[File:Alexander I of Yugoslavia and Mustafa Kemal in 1933.jpg|thumb|During the visit of King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in 1931]]\n\nUntil the early 1930s, Turkey followed a modern neutral foreign policy with the West by developing joint friendship and neutrality agreements. These bilateral agreements were aligned with Atat\u00fcrk's worldview. By the end of 1925, Turkey had signed fifteen joint agreements with Western states.\n\nIn the early 1930s, changes and developments in world politics required Turkey to make multilateral agreements to improve its security. Atat\u00fcrk strongly believed that close cooperation between the Balkan states based on the principle of equality would have an important effect on European politics. These states had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire for centuries and had formed a powerful force. While the origins of the Balkan agreement may date back as far as 1925, the Balkan Pact came to being in the mid-1930s. Several important developments in the Balkan Peninsula and in Europe helped the original idea to materialize, such as improvements in the Turkish-Greek alliance and the rapprochement between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The most important factor in driving Turkish foreign policy from the mid-1930s onwards was the fear of Italy. [[Benito Mussolini]] had frequently proclaimed his intention to make the entire Mediterranean ''[[Mare Nostrum]]''. Both the Turks and the various Balkan states felt threatened by Italian ambitions.\n\nThe [[Balkan Pact]] was negotiated by Atat\u00fcrk with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia. This mutual-defence agreement intended to guarantee the signatories' territorial integrity and political independence against attack by another Balkan state such as Bulgaria or Albania. It countered the increasingly aggressive foreign policy of fascist Italy and the effect of a potential Bulgarian alignment with Nazi Germany. Atat\u00fcrk thought of the Balkan Pact as a medium of balance in the relations with the European countries.<ref>Yilmaz Altu\u00f0, \"Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Dis Politikas\u00fd,\" B.\u00dc.

It was regarded as a significant step forward in consolidating the free world's position in southeast Europe, although it contained no specific military commitments. The importance of the agreement was best displayed in the message which Atat\u00fcrk sent to the Greek Premier, [[Ioannis Metaxas]]:\n\n{{bquote|The borders of the allies in the Balkan Pact are a single border. Those who covet this border will encounter the burning beams of the sun. I recommend avoiding this. The forces that defend our borders are a single and inseparable force.<ref>Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Milli D\u00fd\u00fe Politikas\u00fd, Vol. 2, p. 355</ref>}}\n\nIt was signed by GNA on 28 February The Greek and Yugoslav Parliaments ratified the agreement a few days after. The unanimously ratified Balkan pact became a reality on 18 May 1935 and lasted until 1940.\n\nThe Balkan Pact turned out to be ineffective for reasons that were beyond Atat\u00fcrk's control. What he wanted to prevent with the Balkan Pact was realized by Bulgaria's attempt to put the [[Dobruja]] issue into the agenda after a series of international events ending with the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] on 7 April 1939. These [[Causes of World War II|conflicts]] spread rapidly, triggering World War II. The goal of Atat\u00fcrk, to protect southeast Europe, failed with the dissolution of the pact. The only state which arose intact after the war was Atat\u00fcrk's Republic of Turkey.\n\n====Issue of Hatay====\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Kemal Ataturk congratulation of the Hatay's decision.png|thumb|Telegram sent by Atat\u00fcrk after the local legislative assembly accepted his proposal for the [[Hatay State]]'s flag]]\n\nTurkish Prime-Minister [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] was very conscious of foreign policy issues. During the second half of the 1930s, Atat\u00fcrk tried to form a closer relationship with Britain. The risks of this policy change put the two men at odds. The Hatay issue and the Lyon agreement were two important developments in foreign policy that played a significant role in the severing of relations between Atat\u00fcrk and \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc.\n\nIn 1936, Atat\u00fcrk raised the \"Issue of Hatay\" at the League of Nations. [[Hatay State|Hatay]] was based on the old administrative unit of the Ottoman Empire called the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]]. On behalf of the League of Nations, the representatives of France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey prepared a constitution for Hatay, which established it as an autonomous [[sanjak]] within Syria. Despite some inter-ethnic violence, in the midst of 1938 an election was conducted by the local legislative assembly. The cities of [[Antakya]] (Antioch) and [[\u0130skenderun]] (Alexandretta) joined Turkey in 1939.\n\n===Economic policies===\n{{For|conceptual analysis|Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms#Economic reforms}}\nAtat\u00fcrk instigated economic policies to develop small and large scale businesses, but also to create social strata (industrial bourgeoisie along with the [[peasantry]] of Anatolia) that were virtually non-existent during the Ottoman Empire. The primary problem faced by the politics of his period was the lag in the development of political institutions and social classes which would steer such social and economic changes.<ref>Huntington, ''Political Order in Changing Societies'', 347\u2013357</ref> His vision regarding early Turkish economic policy was apparent during the [[\u0130zmir Economic Congress]] of 1923 which was established before the signing of the [[Lausanne Treaty]]. The initial choices of his economic policies reflected the realities of his period. After World War I, due to the lack of any real potential investors to open private sector factories and develop industrial production, Atat\u00fcrk established many state-owned factories for agriculture, machinery, and textile industries.\n\n====State intervention, 1923\u20131929====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}<!--last 3 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk Nazilli Basma Fabrikas\u0131'n\u0131n a\u00e7\u0131l\u0131\u015f\u0131nda (1937).jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk and [[Cel\u00e2l Bayar]] visiting the S\u00fcmerbank Nazilli Cotton Factory, which was established as a part of the cotton-related industry]]\n\nAtat\u00fcrk's and [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]]'s pursuit of state-controlled economic policies was guided by a national vision; their goal was to knit the country together, eliminate the foreign control of the economy, and improve communications within Turkey. Resources were channeled away from Constantinople, a trading port with international foreign enterprises, in favor of other, less developed cities, in order to establish a more balanced development throughout the country.<ref name=mango470>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 470</ref>\n\nFor Atat\u00fcrk, as for his supporters, tobacco remained wedded to his policy in the pursuit of economic independence. [[Turkish tobacco]] was an important industrial crop, while its cultivation and manufacture had been French monopolies under [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]]. The tobacco and cigarette trade was controlled by two French companies: the \"[[Regie Company]]\" and \"Narquileh Tobacco\".<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', 232\u2013233.</ref> The Ottoman Empire had given the tobacco monopoly to the [[Ottoman Bank]] as a limited company under the \"[[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|Council of the Public Debt]]\". Regie, as part of the Council of the Public Debt, had control over production, storing, and distribution (including export) with unchallenged price control. Consequently, Turkish farmers were dependent on the company for their livelihood.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm |title = T\u00fct\u00fcn, \u0130\u00e7ki ve Tekel |language = Turkish |date = 29 January 2003 |accessdate = 10 October 2007 |last = Aysu |first = Abdullah |publisher = B\u0130A Haber Merkezi |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015212242/http://bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm |archivedate = 15 October 2007 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> In 1925, this company was taken over by the state and named \"[[Tekel]]\". The control of tobacco was the biggest achievement of the Kemalist political machinery's \"[[nationalization]]\" of the economy for a country that did not produce oil. They accompanied this achievement with the development of the cotton industry, which peaked during the early 1930s. Cotton was the second biggest industrial crop in Turkey at the time.\n\nIn 1924, with the initiative of Atat\u00fcrk, the first Turkish bank [[\u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131]] was established. He was the first member of \u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131. The bank's creation was a response to the growing need for a truly national establishment and the birth of a banking system which was capable of backing up economic activities, managing funds accumulated as a result of policies providing savings incentives, and, where necessary, extending resources which could trigger industrial impetus.\n\nIn 1927, [[Turkish State Railways]] was established. Because Atat\u00fcrk considered the development of a national [[Rail transport|rail network]] as another important step in industrialization, it was given high priority. This institution developed an extensive railway network in a very short time. In 1927, Kemal also ordered the integration of road construction goals into development plans. Prior to this, the road network had consisted of 13,885&nbsp; km of ruined surface roads, 4,450&nbsp; km of stabilized roads, and 94 bridges. In 1935, a new entity was established under the government called \"\u015eose ve K\u00f6pr\u00fcler Reisli\u011fi\" which would drive the development of new roads after World War II. However, in 1937, the 22,000&nbsp; km of roads in Turkey augmented the railways.\n\nThe national group{{Clarify|date=December 2008}}, which had Atat\u00fcrk as the leader, developed many projects within the first decade of the republic. However, the Turkish economy was still largely agrarian, with primitive tools and methods; roads and transportation facilities were far from sufficient and management of the economy was inefficient. The [[Great Depression]] brought many changes to this picture.\n\n====Great Depression, 1929\u20131931====\n[[File:Mustafa Kemal surveying the model of the quarter of Ministries.jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk supported large-scale government subsidized industrial complexes, such as [[S\u00fcmerbank]], increasingly after the [[Great Depression]].]]\nThe young republic, like the rest of the world, found itself in a deep economic crisis during the [[Great Depression]]. Atat\u00fcrk reacted to conditions of this period by moving toward integrated economic policies and establishing a central bank to control exchange rates. However, Turkey could not finance essential imports; its currency was shunned and zealous revenue officials seized the meagre possessions of peasants who could not pay their taxes.<ref name=mango470/>\n\nIn 1929, Atat\u00fcrk signed a treaty that resulted in the [[debt restructuring|restructuring of the nation's debt]] with the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]]. He did not fault the Ottoman debt. He had to deal with the turbulent economic issues of the Great Depression along with the payment of the high debt known as the [[Ottoman public debt]]. Until the early 1930s, Turkish private business could not acquire exchange credits. It was impossible to integrate the Turkish economy without a solution to this problem. This increased the credibility of the new Republic.\n\nIn 1931, Atat\u00fcrk's goal of establishing the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]] was realized. The bank's primary purpose was to have control over the exchange rate and [[Ottoman Bank]]'s role during its initial years as a central bank was phased out. Later specialized banks such as the [[S\u00fcmerbank]] (1932) and the [[Etibank]] (1935) were founded.\n\nFrom the [[political economy]] perspective, Atat\u00fcrk had to face the same problems which all countries faced: political upheaval. The establishment of a new party with a different economic perspective was needed; he asked Ali Fethi Okyar to fulfil. The [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] (August 1930) came out with a liberal program and proposed that state monopolies should be ended, foreign capital should be attracted, and that state investment should be curtailed. Atat\u00fcrk supported \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc's point of view: \"it is impossible to attract foreign capital for essential development.\" In 1931, he proclaimed: \"In the economic area ...the programme of the party is statism.\"<ref>Ibrahim Kaya, Social Theory and Later Modernities, page 90</ref> However, the effect of free republicans was felt strongly and state intervention became more moderate, more akin to a form of [[state capitalism]]. One of his radical left-wing supporters, [[Yakup Kadri Karaosmano\u011flu]] from the [[Kadro]] (The Cadre) movement, claimed that Atat\u00fcrk found a third way between capitalism and socialism.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 478</ref>\n\n====Liberalization and planned growth, 1931\u20131939====\n[[File:1932 Mustafa Kemal Etimesgut airport.png|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Atat\u00fcrk at the Etimesgut Airport in [[Ankara]], built by the [[Turkish Aeronautical Association|Turkish Aircraft Association]].

During the War of Independence, she lived with him in \u00c7ankaya, Ankara as his personal assistant. However, after the Turkish army entered \u0130zmir in 1922, Atat\u00fcrk met Latife while staying at the house of her father, the shipping magnate Muammer U\u015fakizade (later U\u015fakl\u0131).

This would mean that the families of Atat\u00fcrk's parents were interrelated. Cemil Bozok also notes that his paternal grandfather, Safer Efendi, was of Albanian origin. This may have a bearing on the vexed question of Atat\u00fcrk's ethnic origin. Atat\u00fcrk's parents and relatives all used Turkish as their mother tongue.

Britain, which controlled the [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman provinces of Egypt and Sudan]], did not allow additional Ottoman troops to reach Libya through Egypt. Ottoman soldiers like Atat\u00fcrk went to Libya either dressed as Arabs (risking imprisonment if noticed by the British authorities in Egypt) or by the very few available ferries (the Italians, who had superior naval forces, effectively controlled the sea routes to Tripoli). However, despite all the hardships, Atat\u00fcrk's forces in Libya managed to repel the Italians on a number of occasions, such as the [[Battle of Tobruk (1911)|Battle of Tobruk]] on 22 December 1911. During the Battle of Derna on 16\u201317 January 1912, while Atat\u00fcrk was assaulting the Italian-controlled fortress of Kasr-\u0131 Harun, two Italian planes dropped bombs on the Ottoman forces; a [[limestone]] splinter from a damaged building's rubble struck Atat\u00fcrk's left eye, causing permanent tissue damage, but not total loss of sight. He received medical treatment for nearly a month; he attempted to leave the Red Crescent's health facilities after only two weeks, but when his eye's situation worsened, he had to return and resume treatment. On 6 March 1912 Atat\u00fcrk became the Commander of the Ottoman forces in Derna. He managed to defend and retain the city and its surrounding region until the end of the Italo-Turkish War on 18 October 1912. Atat\u00fcrk, [[\u0130smail Enver|Enver Bey]], [[Ali Fethi Okyar|Fethi Bey]], and the other Ottoman military commanders in Libya had to return to [[Ottoman territories in Europe|Ottoman Europe]] following the outbreak of the [[Balkan Wars]] on 8 October 1912.

This defining ideology of the Republic of Turkey is referred to as the \"Six Arrows\", or [[Kemalist ideology]].

In forging the new republic, the Turkish revolutionaries turned their back on the perceived corruption and decadence of cosmopolitan Constantinople and its Ottoman heritage.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 391\u2013392</ref> For instance, they made Angora,<!--Turkish names of cities began to be used in English after 1930--> [[Ankara]] in Turkish, the country's new capital and reformed the [[Postage stamps and postal history of Turkey|Turkish postal service]]. Once a provincial town deep in Anatolia, Angora was thus turned into the center of the independence movement. Atat\u00fcrk wanted a \"direct government by the Assembly\"<ref name=\"Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 362\">Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 362</ref> and visualized a [[representative democracy]], [[parliamentary sovereignty]], where the National Parliament would be the ultimate source of power.<ref name=\"Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 362\"/>\n\nIn the following years, he altered his stance somewhat; the country needed an immense amount of reconstruction, and that \"direct government by the Assembly\" could not survive in such an environment. The revolutionaries faced challenges from the supporters of the old Ottoman regime, and also from the supporters of newer ideologies such as communism and fascism. Atat\u00fcrk saw the consequences of fascist and communist doctrines in the 1920s and 1930s and rejected both.<ref>Landau, ''Atat\u00fcrk and the Modernization of Turkey'', 252</ref> He prevented the spread into Turkey of the [[totalitarian]] party rule which held sway in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 501</ref> Some perceived his opposition and silencing of these ideologies as a means of eliminating competition; others believed it was necessary to protect the young Turkish state from succumbing to the instability of new ideologies and competing factions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Under Atat\u00fcrk, the arrest process known as the Arrests of 1927 (''1927 Tevkifat\u0131'') was launched, and a widespread arrest policy was put in place against the [[Communist Party of Turkey (historical)|Communist Party of Turkey]] members.

Education was the cornerstone in this effort. In 1923, there were three main educational groups of institutions. The most common institutions were [[medrese]]s based on Arabic, the Qur'an and memorization. The second type of institution was idad\u00ee and sultan\u00ee, the reformist schools of the [[Tanzimat]] era. The last group included colleges and minority schools in foreign languages that used the latest teaching models in educating pupils. The old medrese education was modernized.<ref name=dew/> Atat\u00fcrk changed the classical Islamic education for a vigorously promoted reconstruction of educational institutions.<ref name=dew/> He linked educational reform to the liberation of the nation from [[dogma]], which he believed was more important than the Turkish War of Independence.

He wanted to institute compulsory primary education for both girls and boys; since then this effort has been an ongoing task for the republic. He pointed out that one of the main targets of [[education in Turkey]] had to be raising a generation nourished with what he called the \"public culture\". The state schools established a common curriculum which became known as the \"unification of education.\"\n\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Atat\u00fcrk with his [[bowler hat]]]]\n\nUnification of education was put into force on 3 March 1924 by the Law on Unification of Education (No. 430). With the new law, education became inclusive, organized on a model of the civil community. In this new design, all schools submitted their curriculum to the \"[[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]]\", a government agency modelled after other countries' ministries of education. Concurrently, the republic abolished the two ministries and made clergy subordinate to the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|department of religious affairs]], one of the foundations of [[secularism in Turkey]]. The unification of education under one curriculum ended \"clerics or clergy of the Ottoman Empire\", but was not the end of religious schools in Turkey; they were moved to higher education until later governments restored them to their former position in secondary after Atat\u00fcrk's death.\n\n[[File:Ataturk-hatreform.jpg|thumb|upright|Atat\u00fcrk with his [[Panama hat]] just after [[s:tr:Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Kastamonu Nutku|the Kastamonu speech]] in 1925]]\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1925, Atat\u00fcrk encouraged the Turks to wear modern European attire.<ref name=UNESCO>\u0130\u011fdemir, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 165\u2013170</ref> He was determined to force the abandonment of the sartorial traditions of the Middle East and finalize a series of dress reforms, which were originally started by [[Mahmud II]].<ref name=UNESCO/> The [[Fez (hat)|fez]] was established by Sultan Mahmud II in 1826 as part of the Ottoman Empire's modernization effort. The [[s:tr:\u015eapka \u0130ktisas\u0131 Hakk\u0131nda Kanun|Hat Law of 1925]] introduced the use of Western-style hats instead of the fez. Atat\u00fcrk first made the hat compulsory for civil servants.<ref name=UNESCO/> The guidelines for the proper dressing of students and state employees were passed during his lifetime; many civil servants adopted the hat willingly. In 1925, Atat\u00fcrk wore a [[Panama hat]] during a public appearance in [[Kastamonu]], one of the most conservative towns in Anatolia, to explain that the hat was the headgear of civilized nations. The last part of reform on dress emphasized the need to wear modern Western suits with neckties as well as Fedora and Derby-style hats instead of antiquated religion-based clothing such as the veil and turban in the [[s:tr:Baz\u0131 Kisvelerin Giyilemiyece\u011fine Dair Kanun|Law Relating to Prohibited Garments of 1934]].\n\nEven though he personally promoted modern dress for women, Atat\u00fcrk never made specific reference to women's clothing in the law, as he believed that women would adapt to the new clothing styles of their own free will. He was frequently photographed on public business with his wife [[L\u00e2tife U\u015fakl\u0131gil]], who covered her head in accordance with Islamic tradition. He was also frequently photographed on public business with women wearing modern Western clothes. But it was Atat\u00fcrk's adopted daughters, [[Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en]] and [[Afet \u0130nan]], who provided the real role model for the Turkish women of the future. He wrote: \"The religious covering of women will not cause difficulty ...

This speech also had another position. He said: {{bquote|In the face of knowledge, science, and of the whole extent of radiant civilization, I cannot accept the presence in Turkey's civilized community of people primitive enough to seek material and spiritual benefits in the guidance of sheiks.

Sheikh Said was a wealthy Kurdish [[tribal chief]] of a local [[Naqshbandi]] order. He emphasized the issue of religion; he not only opposed the abolition of the Caliphate, but also the adoption of civil codes based on Western models, the closure of religious orders, the ban on polygamy, and the new obligatory civil marriage. Sheikh stirred up his followers against the policies of the government, which he considered anti-Islamic. In an effort to restore Islamic law, Sheik's forces moved through the countryside, seized government offices and marched on the important cities of [[Elaz\u0131\u011f]] and [[Diyarbak\u0131r]].<ref>Patrick Kinross, ''Atat\u00fcrk: The Rebirth of a Nation'', 397</ref> Members of the government saw the Sheikh Said Rebellion as an attempt at a counter-revolution. They urged immediate military action to prevent its spread. The \"Law for the Maintenance of Public Order\" was passed to deal with the rebellion on 4 March 1925. It gave the government exceptional powers and included the authority to shut down subversive groups, but was repealed on 4 March 1929.\n\nThere were also parliamentarians in the GNA who were not happy with these changes{{who|date=September 2015}}. So many members were denounced as opposition sympathizers at a private meeting of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) that Atat\u00fcrk expressed his fear of being among the minority in his own party.<ref name=\"PRP\">Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 418</ref> He decided not to purge this group.<ref name=\"PRP\"/> After a [[Censure|censure motion]] gave the chance to have a breakaway group, [[Kaz\u0131m Karabekir]], along with his friends, established such a group on 17 October 1924.

The PRP's economic program suggested liberalism, in contrast to the [[state socialism]] of CHP, and its social program was based on conservatism in contrast to the [[modernism]] of CHP. Leaders of the party strongly supported the Kemalist revolution in principle, but had different opinions on the cultural revolution and the principle of [[secularism]].<ref>Weiker, ''Book Review of Z\u00fcrcher's \"Political Opposition in the Early Turkish Republic: The Progressive Republican Party, 1924\u20131925\"'', 297\u2013298</ref> The PRP was not against Atat\u00fcrk's main positions as declared in its program; they supported establishing secularism in the country and the civil law, or as stated, \"the needs of the age\" (article 3) and the uniform system of education (article 49).<ref name=\"Mango 419\">Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 419</ref> These principles were set by the leaders at the onset.

It originated with a former deputy who had opposed the abolition of the Caliphate. Investigation shifted from an inquiry into the planners to an investigation ostensibly to uncover subversive activities but in truth used to undermine those disagreeing with Atat\u00fcrk's cultural revolution. The sweeping investigation brought a number of political activists before the tribunal, including Karabekir, the leader of PRP. A number of surviving leaders of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], who were at best second-rank in the Turkish movement, including [[Mehmet Cavit Bey|Cavid]], Ahmed \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc, and Ismail Canbulat, were found guilty of treason and hanged.<ref>Touraj Atabaki, Erik Jan Z\u00fcrcher, 2004, Men of Order: authoritarian modernization under Atat\u00fcrk and Reza Shah, I.B.Tauris, {{ISBN|1-86064-426-0}}, page 207</ref> The investigations found a link between the members of the PRP and the Sheikh Said Rebellion.

Atat\u00fcrk began developing social reforms very early, as was evident in his personal journal. He and his staff discussed issues like abolishing the [[Hijab|veiling of women]] and the integration of women into the outside world. The clue on how he was planning to tackle the issue was stated in his journal in November 1915:\n\n{{bquote|The social change can come by (1) educating capable mothers who are knowledgeable about life; (2) giving freedom to women; (3) a man can change his morals, thoughts, and feelings by leading a common life with a woman; as there is an inborn tendency towards the attraction of mutual affection.<ref name=mango164>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 164</ref>}}\n\nAtat\u00fcrk needed a new civil code to establish his second major step of giving freedom to women. The first part was the education of girls and was established with the unification of education. On 4 October 1926, the new Turkish civil code passed. It was modelled after the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. Under the new code, women gained equality with men in such matters as inheritance and divorce. Atat\u00fcrk did not consider gender a factor in social organization. According to his view, society marched towards its goal with men and women united.

The museum highlighted sculpture, which was little practised in Turkey owing to the Islamic tradition of avoiding idolatry. Atat\u00fcrk believed that \"culture is the foundation of the Turkish Republic,\"<ref name=atillasoy15>Atillasoy, ''Atat\u00fcrk : first president and founder of the Turkish Republic'', 15</ref> and described modern Turkey's ideological thrust as \"a creation of patriotism blended with a lofty humanist ideal.\" He included both his own nation's creative legacy and what he saw as the admirable values of global civilization. The pre-Islamic [[Turkic peoples|culture of the Turks]] became the subject of extensive research, and particular emphasis was laid upon Turkish culture widespread before the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] civilizations. He instigated study of [[History of Anatolia|Anatolian civilizations]]\u2014[[Phrygians]] and [[Lydians]], [[Sumer]]ians and [[Hittites]]. To attract current public attention to past cultures, he personally named the \"[[S\u00fcmerbank]]\" (1932) after the Sumerians and the \"[[Etibank]]\" (1935) after the Hittites.

On 1 November 1928, he introduced the new Turkish alphabet and abolished the use of Arabic script. At the time, literate citizens of the country comprised as little as 10% of the population.

He instigated official education meetings called \"Science Boards\" and \"Education Summits.\" to discuss the quality of education, training issues and certain basic educational principles. He said, \"our schools [curriculum] should aim to provide opportunities for all pupils to learn and to achieve.\" He was personally engaged with the development of two textbooks. The first one was ''{{lang-tr|Vatanda\u015f \u0130\u00e7in Medeni Bilgiler}}'' (1930). The second, ''Geometry'' (1937), was a text for high schools. The ''Vatanda\u015f \u0130\u00e7in Medeni Bilgiler'' (''Civic knowledge for the citizens'') introduced the science of comparative government and explained the means of administering public trust by explaining the rules of governance as applied to the new state institutions.\n\n====Opposition to Mustafa Kemal in 1930\u20131931====\n[[File:Ataturk and Fethi Okyar.jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk with the [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] leader [[Ali Fethi Okyar]] and his daughter in [[Yalova]], on 13 August 1930]]\nOn 11 August 1930, Atat\u00fcrk decided to try a multiparty movement once again and asked Ali Fethi Okyar to establish a new party. He insisted on the protection of secular reforms. The brand-new [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] succeeded all around the country. Without the establishment of a real political spectrum, once again, the party became the center to opposition of Atat\u00fcrk's reforms, particularly in regard to the role of religion in public life.\n\nOn 23 December 1930, a chain of violent incidents occurred, starting with the rebellion of Islamic fundamentalists in [[Menemen]], a small town in the Aegean region. This so-called [[Menemen Incident]] was considered a serious threat against secular reforms.\n\nIn November 1930, Ali Fethi Okyar dissolved his own party. A more lasting [[multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey]] began in 1945. In 1950, the CHP released the majority position to the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, historical)|Democratic Party]]. There are arguments that Atat\u00fcrk's single-party rule did not promote [[direct democracy]]. The reason experiments with [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] failed during this period was that not all groups in the country had agreed to a minimal consensus regarding shared values (mainly secularism) and shared rules for conflict resolution. In response to such criticisms, Atat\u00fcrk's biographer [[Andrew Mango]] said: \"between the two wars, democracy could not be sustained in many relatively richer and better-educated societies. Atat\u00fcrk's enlightened authoritarianism left a reasonable space for free private lives. More could not have been expected in his lifetime.\"<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 536</ref> Even though, at times, he did not appear to be a democrat in his actions, he always supported the idea of building a [[civil society]]: a system of voluntary civic and social organizations and institutions as opposed to the force-backed structures of the state. In one of his many speeches about the importance of democracy, Atat\u00fcrk said in 1933:\n\n{{bquote|Republic means the democratic administration of the state.

During the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], [[Lieutenant General]] [[William Marshall (British Army officer)|William Marshall]] followed the British War Office's instruction that \"every effort was to be made to score as heavily as possible on the Tigris before the whistle blew\", capturing Mosul three days after the signature of the [[Armistice of Mudros]] (30 October 1918).<ref name=\"britainsoil\">Peter Sluglett, \"The Primacy of Oil in Britain's Iraq Policy\", in the book \"Britain in Iraq: 1914\u20131932\" London: Ithaca Press, 1976, pp. 103\u2013116</ref> In 1920, the ''[[Misak-\u0131 Milli]]'', which consolidated the \"Turkish lands\", declared that Mosul Province was a part of the historic Turkish heartland. The British were in a precarious situation with the Issue of Mosul and were adopting almost equally desperate measures to protect their interests. The [[Iraqi revolt against the British]] was put down by the [[RAF Iraq Command]] during the summer of 1920. From the British perspective, if Atat\u00fcrk stabilized Turkey, he would then turn his attention to Mosul and penetrate Mesopotamia, where the native population would probably join him thus bringing an insurgent and hostile Muslim nation to the very gates of India.\n\nIn 1923, Atat\u00fcrk tried to persuade the GNA that accepting the arbitration of the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] over Mosul did not mean relinquishing Mosul, but rather waiting for a time when Turkey might be stronger. The artificially drawn border had an unsettling effect on the population on both sides. Later, it was claimed that Turkey began where the oil ends, as the border was drawn by the British geophysicists based on the oil reserves.

The relationship between the rebels and Britain was questioned. British assistance was sought after the rebels realised that the rebellion, or its expected outcome, could not stand by itself.<ref>Olson, Robert W. (1989) The Emergence of Kurdish Nationalism and the Sheikh Said Rebellion, 1880\u20131925, p.45</ref>\n\nIn 1925, the League of Nations formed a three-member committee to study the case while the Sheikh Said Rebellion was on the rise. Partly because of the continuing uncertainties along the northern frontier (present-day northern Iraq), the committee recommended that the region should be connected to Iraq with the condition that the UK would hold the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]. By the end of March 1925, the necessary troop movements were completed, and the whole area of the Sheikh Said rebellion was encircled.<ref>Kinross, 401</ref> As a result of these manoeuvres, the revolt was put down. Britain, Iraq and Kemal made a treaty on 5 June 1926, which mostly followed the decisions of the League Council. In 1926, Kemal faced growing opposition to his reform policies, a continuing precarious economic situation, and a defeat in the Mosul issue. A large section of the Kurdish population and the [[Iraqi Turkmen]] were left on the other side of the border. The Sheikh Said Rebellion hastened both the imposition of the Republican Party and the speed of Atat\u00fcrk's reforms. In 1925, the population was largely illiterate and disparate. Turkey was in ruins, reconstruction was difficult, poverty was everywhere and people were in pain, which fed separatist violence.<ref>ASD: Speeches and statements by Atat\u00fcrk, volume I pages 361\u2013363 published by Atat\u00fcrk Culture, language and history Higher Institute, Ankara 1989</ref> Rather than to a section of the population, Atat\u00fcrk attributed the rebellion to a group of notables, who  on 7 March 1925 were found guilty by the courts (kanunen mucrim olan bazi muteneffizan) and who used the mask of religion to conceal the interests of landlords, feudal tribal leaders and other \"reactionaries\".<ref name=mangokurds20>Andrew Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk and the Kurds'', Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.35, No.4, 1999, 20</ref>\n\n====Relations with the Russian SFSR/Soviet Union====\n{{See also|Russia\u2013Turkey relations#Turkey and the Soviet Union }}\n[[File:Diplomatic reception held in the Soviet Embassy in Ankara 1927 cropped.jpg|thumb|During a reception at the [[USSR]] Embassy in Ankara, on 7 November 1927]]\n[[File:Mustafa Kemal and Voroshilov on 29 October 1933.jpg|thumb|Exchanges on the concept of a Balkan Federation during the visit of [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], a vision of Kemal's which was never achieved]]\n\nIn his message to [[Vladimir Lenin]], the Bolshevik leader and head of the [[Russian SFSR]]'s government, dated 26 April 1920, Kemal promised to coordinate his military operations with the Bolsheviks' \"fight against [[imperialist]] governments\" and requested 5 million [[Turkish lira|lira]] in gold as well as armaments \"as first aid\" to his forces.<ref name=\"LetterLenin\">''\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c'' (the Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Foreign Minisrty]]'s magazine).

The war had devastated [[Aegean Region|Western Anatolia]], and the financial burden of [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Ottoman Muslim refugees]] from Greece blocked rapprochement.

Indeed, Venizelos' successor [[Panagis Tsaldaris]] came to visit Atat\u00fcrk in September 1933 and signed a more comprehensive agreement called the ''Entente Cordiale'' between Greece and Turkey, which was a stepping stone for the [[Balkan Pact]].\n\nGreek Premier [[Ioannis Metaxas]] said of Atat\u00fcrk and the Turkish-Greek alliance, that \"...Greece, which has the highest estimation of the renowned leader, heroic soldier, and enlightened creator of Turkey.

The treaty united the Afghan king's call for greater Oriental-Middle Eastern cooperation, Reza Shah's goal in securing relations with Turkey that would help Iran free itself from Soviet and British influence, and Atat\u00fcrk's foreign policy of securing stability in the region. The immediate outcome was to deter Mussolini from adventures in the region.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 510</ref>\n\n====Turkish Straits====\n[[File:King Edward VIII and President Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Atat\u00fcrk with King [[Edward VIII]] of the [[United Kingdom]] in [[Istanbul]], 4 September 1936]]\n\nOn 24 July 1923, the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] included the Lausanne Straits Agreement. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the [[Dardanelles]] should remain open to all commercial vessels: seizure of foreign military vessels was subject to certain limitations during peacetime, and, even as a neutral state, Turkey could not limit any military passage during wartime. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the waterway was to be demilitarized, and its management left to the Straits Commission. The demilitarized zone heavily restricted Turkey's domination and sovereignty over the Straits. The defence of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] was impossible without having the sovereignty over the water that passed through it.\n\nIn March 1936, Hitler's [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|reoccupation of the Rhineland]] gave Atat\u00fcrk the opportunity to resume full control over the Straits. \"The situation in Europe\", he declared \"is highly appropriate for such a move. We shall certainly achieve it\".<ref>Sosyal, Ismail, 1983, \"Turkey's Diplomatic treaties\", TTK, Ankara page 493</ref> [[Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras]], who was the foreign minister, initiated a move to revise the Straits' regime. Aras claimed that he was directed by the President, rather than his Prime Minister, \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc. \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc was worried about harming relations with Britain, France, and Balkan neighbors over the Straits. However, the signatories agreed to join the conference, since unlimited military passage had become unfavourable to Turkey with the changes in world politics. Atat\u00fcrk demanded that the members of the Turkish Foreign Office devise a solution that would transfer full control over the waterway to Turkey.\n\nOn 20 July 1936, the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits|Montreux Convention]] was signed, with the participation of Bulgaria, Great Britain, Australia, France, Japan, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Yugoslavia and Greece. It became the primary instrument governing the passage of commercial and war vessels through the Dardanelles Strait. It was ratified by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|GNAT]] on 31 July 1936. It went into effect on 9 November 1936 and is still valid today.\n\n====Balkan Pact====\n[[File:Alexander I of Yugoslavia and Mustafa Kemal in 1933.jpg|thumb|During the visit of King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in 1931]]\n\nUntil the early 1930s, Turkey followed a modern neutral foreign policy with the West by developing joint friendship and neutrality agreements. These bilateral agreements were aligned with Atat\u00fcrk's worldview. By the end of 1925, Turkey had signed fifteen joint agreements with Western states.\n\nIn the early 1930s, changes and developments in world politics required Turkey to make multilateral agreements to improve its security. Atat\u00fcrk strongly believed that close cooperation between the Balkan states based on the principle of equality would have an important effect on European politics. These states had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire for centuries and had formed a powerful force. While the origins of the Balkan agreement may date back as far as 1925, the Balkan Pact came to being in the mid-1930s. Several important developments in the Balkan Peninsula and in Europe helped the original idea to materialize, such as improvements in the Turkish-Greek alliance and the rapprochement between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The most important factor in driving Turkish foreign policy from the mid-1930s onwards was the fear of Italy. [[Benito Mussolini]] had frequently proclaimed his intention to make the entire Mediterranean ''[[Mare Nostrum]]''. Both the Turks and the various Balkan states felt threatened by Italian ambitions.\n\nThe [[Balkan Pact]] was negotiated by Atat\u00fcrk with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia. This mutual-defence agreement intended to guarantee the signatories' territorial integrity and political independence against attack by another Balkan state such as Bulgaria or Albania. It countered the increasingly aggressive foreign policy of fascist Italy and the effect of a potential Bulgarian alignment with Nazi Germany. Atat\u00fcrk thought of the Balkan Pact as a medium of balance in the relations with the European countries.<ref>Yilmaz Altu\u00f0, \"Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Dis Politikas\u00fd,\" B.\u00dc.

It was regarded as a significant step forward in consolidating the free world's position in southeast Europe, although it contained no specific military commitments. The importance of the agreement was best displayed in the message which Atat\u00fcrk sent to the Greek Premier, [[Ioannis Metaxas]]:\n\n{{bquote|The borders of the allies in the Balkan Pact are a single border. Those who covet this border will encounter the burning beams of the sun. I recommend avoiding this. The forces that defend our borders are a single and inseparable force.<ref>Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Milli D\u00fd\u00fe Politikas\u00fd, Vol. 2, p. 355</ref>}}\n\nIt was signed by GNA on 28 February The Greek and Yugoslav Parliaments ratified the agreement a few days after. The unanimously ratified Balkan pact became a reality on 18 May 1935 and lasted until 1940.\n\nThe Balkan Pact turned out to be ineffective for reasons that were beyond Atat\u00fcrk's control. What he wanted to prevent with the Balkan Pact was realized by Bulgaria's attempt to put the [[Dobruja]] issue into the agenda after a series of international events ending with the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] on 7 April 1939. These [[Causes of World War II|conflicts]] spread rapidly, triggering World War II. The goal of Atat\u00fcrk, to protect southeast Europe, failed with the dissolution of the pact. The only state which arose intact after the war was Atat\u00fcrk's Republic of Turkey.\n\n====Issue of Hatay====\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Kemal Ataturk congratulation of the Hatay's decision.png|thumb|Telegram sent by Atat\u00fcrk after the local legislative assembly accepted his proposal for the [[Hatay State]]'s flag]]\n\nTurkish Prime-Minister [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] was very conscious of foreign policy issues. During the second half of the 1930s, Atat\u00fcrk tried to form a closer relationship with Britain. The risks of this policy change put the two men at odds. The Hatay issue and the Lyon agreement were two important developments in foreign policy that played a significant role in the severing of relations between Atat\u00fcrk and \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc.\n\nIn 1936, Atat\u00fcrk raised the \"Issue of Hatay\" at the League of Nations. [[Hatay State|Hatay]] was based on the old administrative unit of the Ottoman Empire called the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]]. On behalf of the League of Nations, the representatives of France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey prepared a constitution for Hatay, which established it as an autonomous [[sanjak]] within Syria. Despite some inter-ethnic violence, in the midst of 1938 an election was conducted by the local legislative assembly. The cities of [[Antakya]] (Antioch) and [[\u0130skenderun]] (Alexandretta) joined Turkey in 1939.\n\n===Economic policies===\n{{For|conceptual analysis|Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms#Economic reforms}}\nAtat\u00fcrk instigated economic policies to develop small and large scale businesses, but also to create social strata (industrial bourgeoisie along with the [[peasantry]] of Anatolia) that were virtually non-existent during the Ottoman Empire. The primary problem faced by the politics of his period was the lag in the development of political institutions and social classes which would steer such social and economic changes.<ref>Huntington, ''Political Order in Changing Societies'', 347\u2013357</ref> His vision regarding early Turkish economic policy was apparent during the [[\u0130zmir Economic Congress]] of 1923 which was established before the signing of the [[Lausanne Treaty]]. The initial choices of his economic policies reflected the realities of his period. After World War I, due to the lack of any real potential investors to open private sector factories and develop industrial production, Atat\u00fcrk established many state-owned factories for agriculture, machinery, and textile industries.\n\n====State intervention, 1923\u20131929====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}<!--last 3 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk Nazilli Basma Fabrikas\u0131'n\u0131n a\u00e7\u0131l\u0131\u015f\u0131nda (1937).jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk and [[Cel\u00e2l Bayar]] visiting the S\u00fcmerbank Nazilli Cotton Factory, which was established as a part of the cotton-related industry]]\n\nAtat\u00fcrk's and [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]]'s pursuit of state-controlled economic policies was guided by a national vision; their goal was to knit the country together, eliminate the foreign control of the economy, and improve communications within Turkey. Resources were channeled away from Constantinople, a trading port with international foreign enterprises, in favor of other, less developed cities, in order to establish a more balanced development throughout the country.<ref name=mango470>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 470</ref>\n\nFor Atat\u00fcrk, as for his supporters, tobacco remained wedded to his policy in the pursuit of economic independence. [[Turkish tobacco]] was an important industrial crop, while its cultivation and manufacture had been French monopolies under [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]]. The tobacco and cigarette trade was controlled by two French companies: the \"[[Regie Company]]\" and \"Narquileh Tobacco\".<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', 232\u2013233.</ref> The Ottoman Empire had given the tobacco monopoly to the [[Ottoman Bank]] as a limited company under the \"[[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|Council of the Public Debt]]\". Regie, as part of the Council of the Public Debt, had control over production, storing, and distribution (including export) with unchallenged price control. Consequently, Turkish farmers were dependent on the company for their livelihood.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm |title = T\u00fct\u00fcn, \u0130\u00e7ki ve Tekel |language = Turkish |date = 29 January 2003 |accessdate = 10 October 2007 |last = Aysu |first = Abdullah |publisher = B\u0130A Haber Merkezi |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015212242/http://bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm |archivedate = 15 October 2007 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> In 1925, this company was taken over by the state and named \"[[Tekel]]\". The control of tobacco was the biggest achievement of the Kemalist political machinery's \"[[nationalization]]\" of the economy for a country that did not produce oil. They accompanied this achievement with the development of the cotton industry, which peaked during the early 1930s. Cotton was the second biggest industrial crop in Turkey at the time.\n\nIn 1924, with the initiative of Atat\u00fcrk, the first Turkish bank [[\u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131]] was established. He was the first member of \u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131. The bank's creation was a response to the growing need for a truly national establishment and the birth of a banking system which was capable of backing up economic activities, managing funds accumulated as a result of policies providing savings incentives, and, where necessary, extending resources which could trigger industrial impetus.\n\nIn 1927, [[Turkish State Railways]] was established. Because Atat\u00fcrk considered the development of a national [[Rail transport|rail network]] as another important step in industrialization, it was given high priority. This institution developed an extensive railway network in a very short time. In 1927, Kemal also ordered the integration of road construction goals into development plans. Prior to this, the road network had consisted of 13,885&nbsp; km of ruined surface roads, 4,450&nbsp; km of stabilized roads, and 94 bridges. In 1935, a new entity was established under the government called \"\u015eose ve K\u00f6pr\u00fcler Reisli\u011fi\" which would drive the development of new roads after World War II. However, in 1937, the 22,000&nbsp; km of roads in Turkey augmented the railways.\n\nThe national group{{Clarify|date=December 2008}}, which had Atat\u00fcrk as the leader, developed many projects within the first decade of the republic. However, the Turkish economy was still largely agrarian, with primitive tools and methods; roads and transportation facilities were far from sufficient and management of the economy was inefficient. The [[Great Depression]] brought many changes to this picture.\n\n====Great Depression, 1929\u20131931====\n[[File:Mustafa Kemal surveying the model of the quarter of Ministries.jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk supported large-scale government subsidized industrial complexes, such as [[S\u00fcmerbank]], increasingly after the [[Great Depression]].]]\nThe young republic, like the rest of the world, found itself in a deep economic crisis during the [[Great Depression]]. Atat\u00fcrk reacted to conditions of this period by moving toward integrated economic policies and establishing a central bank to control exchange rates. However, Turkey could not finance essential imports; its currency was shunned and zealous revenue officials seized the meagre possessions of peasants who could not pay their taxes.<ref name=mango470/>\n\nIn 1929, Atat\u00fcrk signed a treaty that resulted in the [[debt restructuring|restructuring of the nation's debt]] with the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]]. He did not fault the Ottoman debt. He had to deal with the turbulent economic issues of the Great Depression along with the payment of the high debt known as the [[Ottoman public debt]]. Until the early 1930s, Turkish private business could not acquire exchange credits. It was impossible to integrate the Turkish economy without a solution to this problem. This increased the credibility of the new Republic.\n\nIn 1931, Atat\u00fcrk's goal of establishing the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]] was realized. The bank's primary purpose was to have control over the exchange rate and [[Ottoman Bank]]'s role during its initial years as a central bank was phased out. Later specialized banks such as the [[S\u00fcmerbank]] (1932) and the [[Etibank]] (1935) were founded.\n\nFrom the [[political economy]] perspective, Atat\u00fcrk had to face the same problems which all countries faced: political upheaval. The establishment of a new party with a different economic perspective was needed; he asked Ali Fethi Okyar to fulfil. The [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] (August 1930) came out with a liberal program and proposed that state monopolies should be ended, foreign capital should be attracted, and that state investment should be curtailed. Atat\u00fcrk supported \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc's point of view: \"it is impossible to attract foreign capital for essential development.\" In 1931, he proclaimed: \"In the economic area ...the programme of the party is statism.\"<ref>Ibrahim Kaya, Social Theory and Later Modernities, page 90</ref> However, the effect of free republicans was felt strongly and state intervention became more moderate, more akin to a form of [[state capitalism]]. One of his radical left-wing supporters, [[Yakup Kadri Karaosmano\u011flu]] from the [[Kadro]] (The Cadre) movement, claimed that Atat\u00fcrk found a third way between capitalism and socialism.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 478</ref>\n\n====Liberalization and planned growth, 1931\u20131939====\n[[File:1932 Mustafa Kemal Etimesgut airport.png|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Atat\u00fcrk at the Etimesgut Airport in [[Ankara]], built by the [[Turkish Aeronautical Association|Turkish Aircraft Association]].

During the War of Independence, she lived with him in \u00c7ankaya, Ankara as his personal assistant. However, after the Turkish army entered \u0130zmir in 1922, Atat\u00fcrk met Latife while staying at the house of her father, the shipping magnate Muammer U\u015fakizade (later U\u015fakl\u0131).
