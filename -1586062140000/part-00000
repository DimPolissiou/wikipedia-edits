However, Schreibvogel, local volunteers, and Red Oak police were quickly overwhelmed by the task of corralling the large and fast-running birds, several of which died. Schreibvogel and another man resorted to killing emus with shotguns and were accused of animal cruelty by police. However, since the emus were considered [[livestock]], they could lawfully be killed humanely in Texas, and a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] declined to indict Schreibvogel. Most surviving birds ultimately wound up at Texas ranches.<ref name=DMN_3Apr20/>\n\nIn 2000, Schreibvogel acquired his first tigers (two abandoned tigers).<ref name=\":0\" /> To feed his growing zoo of [[big cat]]s, he took in horses that were donated to him.

Schreibvogel and another man resorted to killing emus with shotguns and were accused of animal cruelty by police. However, since the emus were considered [[livestock]], they could lawfully be killed humanely in Texas, and a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] declined to indict Schreibvogel. Most surviving birds ultimately wound up at Texas ranches.<ref name=DMN_3Apr20/>\n\nIn 2000, Schreibvogel acquired his first tigers (two abandoned tigers).<ref name=\":0\" /> To feed his growing zoo of [[big cat]]s, he took in horses that were donated to him.

It is commonly considered a [[flagship species]] within its range, with the efforts going into its conservation having positive effects on many other species that share its habitat. Recent genetic research suggests it is closely related to the [[wattlebird]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFirst described by the English naturalist, [[George Shaw]], in 1794, the regent honeyeater was moved to ''[[Anthochaera]]'' in 1827 by the naturalists, [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]].{{sfn|Vigors|Horsfield|1827|pp=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/778569 320-321]}} It was known as ''Xanthomyza phrygia'' for many years, the genus erected by [[William John Swainson]] in 1837. DNA analysis shows that its ancestry is in fact nested within the wattlebird genus ''[[Anthochaera]]''. The ancestor of the regent honeyeater split from a lineage that gave rise to the [[red wattlebird|red]] and [[yellow wattlebird]]s. The little and western wattlebirds arose from another lineage that diverged earlier.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Driskell, Amy C.|author2=Christidis, Les|author2-link=Leslie Christidis|year=2004|title=Phylogeny and Evolution of the Australo-Papuan Honeyeaters (Passeriformes, Meliphagidae)|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|pmid=15120392|volume=31|issue=3|pages=943\u201360|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2003.10.017}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe neck and head are glossy black.

It is commonly considered a [[flagship species]] within its range, with the efforts going into its conservation having positive effects on many other species that share its habitat. Recent genetic research suggests it is closely related to the [[wattlebird]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFirst described by the naturalist [[George Shaw]] in 1794, the regent honeyeater was moved to ''[[Anthochaera]]'' in 1827 by the naturalists [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]].{{sfn|Vigors|Horsfield|1827|pp=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/778569 320-321]}} It was known as ''Xanthomyza phrygia'' for many years, the genus erected by [[William John Swainson]] in 1837. DNA analysis shows that its ancestry is in fact nested within the wattlebird genus ''[[Anthochaera]]''. The ancestor of the regent honeyeater split from a lineage that gave rise to the [[red wattlebird|red]] and [[yellow wattlebird]]s. The little and western wattlebirds arose from another lineage that diverged earlier.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Driskell, Amy C.|author2=Christidis, Les|author2-link=Leslie Christidis|year=2004|title=Phylogeny and Evolution of the Australo-Papuan Honeyeaters (Passeriformes, Meliphagidae)|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|pmid=15120392|volume=31|issue=3|pages=943\u201360|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2003.10.017}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe neck and head are glossy black.
