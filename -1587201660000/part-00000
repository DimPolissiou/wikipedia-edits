In 2018, a so-called \"witch hunt\" was declared against gay people in [[Dar es Salaam]], where gay people were forced to endure anal examinations and torture.<ref name=\"hrw\"/> Tanzania has a bad human rights record. Government respect for [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly]] is declining.\n\n==History==\nPrior to colonisation, various modern-day Tanzanian ethnic groups accepted homosexuality or viewed it with indifference.<ref name=\"africa\"/>\n\nThe [[Swahili people]] had traditions of acceptance towards homosexuality. Homosexuals are known as {{lang|sw|shoga}} (plural: {{lang|sw|mashoga}}), and historically had certain social roles, such as drumming and playing music at marriages and other festivals.<ref>[http://www.colorq.org/articles/article.aspx?d=2000&x=qcolor Same sex relationships and gender identities among non-whites]</ref> The word {{lang|sw|shoga}} was also used by women to refer to \"friends\". Over time, {{lang|sw|shoga}} relationships turned into economic relations, with poorer young men being paid by richer older men ({{lang|sw|basha}}, plural: {{lang|sw|mabasha}}) for sexual relations. Socially, only the {{lang|sw|mashoga}} were regarded as \"homosexual\", the {{lang|sw|mabasha}} would usually have a wife.<ref name=\"africa\"/><ref>[http://www.willsworld.org/africa.html Boy-Wives and Female Husbands]</ref>\n\n{{quote|Mombasa's mashoga are passive male homosexuals offering their persons for money.

Lesbians (known as {{lang|sw|msagaji}} or {{lang|sw|msago}} (plural: {{lang|sw|wasagaji}} or {{lang|sw|misago}}), literally ''grinders'') also had certain societal roles, including doing tasks typically associated with men. Similarly to {{lang|sw|shoga}} relationships, {{lang|sw|msagaji}} relationships were also defined for economic purposes, though less so. The older partner ({{lang|sw|mama}} (plural: {{lang|sw|mwana}})) was typically wealthier and of a higher social class. Women who resisted marriage and were interested in education and careers were perceived as being {{lang|sw|wasagaji}}, regardless of their actual sexual orientation. Collectively, homosexuals were called {{lang|sw|mke-si-mume}} (literally ''woman, not man'').<ref name=\"africa\"/>\n\nAmong the [[Maasai people]], traditions of cross-dressing were common and typically performed at rituals.

Laws punishing homosexuality were enacted, and over time homophobia has become deeply ingrained in the population. In 2015, Adebisi Ademola Alimi, then a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], discussed this omnipresent homophobia in, not only Tanzania, but in Africa as a whole.\n\n{{quote|One factor is the increased popularity of fundamental Christianity, by way of American televangelists, since the 1980s.

[that included] several detailed allegations of [the] torture and abuse of [LGBT] individuals while in police custody. For example, ... a 19-year-old gay man who was arrested after departing a nightclub in [[Mbeya]] ... reported [that] police raped and beat him on the soles of his feet with canes, electric wires, and water pipes. ... Consensual same-sex sexual conduct is illegal on the mainland and on Zanzibar. On the mainland, acts of \"gross indecency\" between persons of the same sex are punishable by up to five years in prison. The law refers to same-sex sexual conduct as an \"unnatural offense\" and carries a prison sentence of 30 years to life. The law on Zanzibar establishes a penalty of up to 14 years in prison for men who engage in same-sex sexual conduct and five years for women. The burden of proof in such cases is significant. According to a recent Human Rights Watch report, ... [arrested] LGBT persons [were only] rarely ... [prosecuted. The arrests were] usually ... a pretext for police to collect bribes or coerce sex from vulnerable people. Nonetheless, the [Tanzanian Commission for Human Rights and Good Government's] ... 2011 prison visits revealed that \"unnatural offenses\" were among the most common reasons for pretrial detention of minors. In the past[,] courts ... charged individuals suspected of same-sex sexual conduct with loitering or prostitution.

In October 2017, it deported several HIV/AIDS groups on the basis of \"promoting homosexuality\" (Tanzania has a high HIV/AIDS rate and reportedly one million people are infected).<ref name=\"hrw\"/> The Government has also increasingly resorted to homophobic rhetoric, believing that homosexuality is \"un-African\". In 2018, a so-called \"witch hunt\" was declared against gay people in [[Dar es Salaam]], where gay people were forced to endure anal examinations and torture.<ref name=\"hrw\"/> Tanzania has a bad human rights record. Government respect for [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly]] is declining.\n\n==History==\nPrior to colonisation, various modern-day Tanzanian ethnic groups accepted homosexuality or viewed it with indifference.<ref name=\"africa\"/>\n\nThe [[Swahili people]] had traditions of acceptance towards homosexuality. Homosexuals are known as {{lang|sw|shoga}} (plural: {{lang|sw|mashoga}}), and historically had certain social roles, such as drumming and playing music at marriages and other festivals.<ref>[http://www.colorq.org/articles/article.aspx?d=2000&x=qcolor Same sex relationships and gender identities among non-whites]</ref> The word {{lang|sw|shoga}} was also used by women to refer to \"friends\". Over time, {{lang|sw|shoga}} relationships turned into economic relations, with poorer young men being paid by richer older men ({{lang|sw|basha}}, plural: {{lang|sw|mabasha}}) for sexual relations. Socially, only the {{lang|sw|mashoga}} were regarded as \"homosexual\", the {{lang|sw|mabasha}} would usually have a wife.<ref name=\"africa\"/><ref>[http://www.willsworld.org/africa.html Boy-Wives and Female Husbands]</ref>\n\n{{quote|Mombasa's mashoga are passive male homosexuals offering their persons for money.

Lesbians (known as {{lang|sw|msagaji}} or {{lang|sw|msago}} (plural: {{lang|sw|wasagaji}} or {{lang|sw|misago}}), literally ''grinders'') also had certain societal roles, including doing tasks typically associated with men. Similarly to {{lang|sw|shoga}} relationships, {{lang|sw|msagaji}} relationships were also defined for economic purposes, though less so. The older partner ({{lang|sw|mama}} (plural: {{lang|sw|mwana}})) was typically wealthier and of a higher social class. Women who resisted marriage and were interested in education and careers were perceived as being {{lang|sw|wasagaji}}, regardless of their actual sexual orientation. Collectively, homosexuals were called {{lang|sw|mke-si-mume}} (literally ''woman, not man'').<ref name=\"africa\"/>\n\nAmong the [[Maasai people]], traditions of cross-dressing were common and typically performed at rituals. During initiation rituals, young male Maasai would often dress as women and wear the {{lang|mas|surutya}} (ear-rings worn by women to show that they are married) and other female garments.<ref name=\"africa\">[https://mkenyaujerumani.de/2014/02/01/homosexuality-unafrican-not-really/ Homosexuality unAfrican?

Though now not perceived as being \"homosexual\", these marriages are performed for economic and diplomatic purposes, such as when a family has no son.<ref>[http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/4/homosexuality-africamuseveniugandanigeriaethiopia.html Homosexuality is not un-African]</ref>\n\nSocietal acceptance and tolerance of homosexuality and same-sex relationships quickly disappeared after the arrival of the Europeans. Laws punishing homosexuality were enacted, and over time homophobia has become deeply ingrained in the population. In 2015, Adebisi Ademola Alimi, then a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], discussed this omnipresent homophobia in, not only Tanzania, but in Africa as a whole.\n\n{{quote|One factor is the increased popularity of fundamental Christianity, by way of American televangelists, since the 1980s.

According to a recent Human Rights Watch report, ... [arrested] LGBT persons [were only] rarely ... [prosecuted. The arrests were] usually ... a pretext for police to collect bribes or coerce sex from vulnerable people. Nonetheless, the [Tanzanian Commission for Human Rights and Good Government's] ... 2011 prison visits revealed that \"unnatural offenses\" were among the most common reasons for pretrial detention of minors. In the past[,] courts ... charged individuals suspected of same-sex sexual conduct with loitering or prostitution. LGBT persons faced societal discrimination that restricted their access to health care, housing, and employment. This group was also denied health care such as access to information about HIV. There were no known government efforts to combat such discrimination.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/220379.pdf | title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013: Tanzania | publisher=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, United States Department of State | pages=3, 4, 33 | accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Universal Periodic Reviews by the United Nations Human Rights Council===\nThe [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in October 2011 at its meeting in Geneva completed a Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the human rights situation in Tanzania. At this UPR, [[Slovenia]], [[Sweden]], and the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) publicly urged Tanzania to repeal its statutes that criminalize same-sex sexual activities. The UNCT said in paragraph 27 of its report:\n\n<blockquote>Homosexuality is considered contrary to cultural norms; same sex sexual relations are criminalized. Group arrests in connection with peaceful assemblies, non-attendance to HIV patients, as well as forcible evictions of persons due to their sexual orientation by local and religious communities have been reported. Moreover, representatives of the groups and other human rights defenders may not be willing to make public statements in favor of tolerance and decriminalization for fear of reprisals.<ref>[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/session12/TZ/UNCT-eng.pdf \"Submission from the United Nations Country Team\", 12th Universal Periodic Review Session, The United Republic of Tanzania, paragraph 27 on page 7]</ref></blockquote>\n\nTanzania refused.<ref>[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/A-HRC-19-4_en.pdf \"Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: The United Republic of Tanzania\", United Nations Human Rights Council, A/HRC/19/4, 8 December 2011, paragraph 87 on page 22]</ref> [[Mathias Meinrad Chikawe]], the Tanzanian Minister of State and Good Governance, said in Geneva,\n\n<blockquote>There was an issue raised on same-sex marriages, etc. It is true we do not have a law allowing same-sex marriages in our country, and that I say again, due to our own traditions and very cultural strong beliefs. Although activities involving same-sex do take place, but they do take place under cover, so to say, and like I said when I was presenting our report on the ICCPR [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights], that if one were to exhibit such a behavior in public, one could be, actually be stoned by the public itself. It is a cultural thing. It's not yet acceptable. So the government ... it would be very strange for the government to propose a law towards allowing that; so, it's just that maybe time has not come for us to consider such freedoms in our country.<ref>[http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/webcast/2011/10/upr-report-of-tanzania-12th-universal-periodic-review.html United Nations Webcast, UPR Report of Tanzania, 12th Universal Periodic Review, 3 October 2011, beginning at 2:42 time stamp]</ref></blockquote>\n\n===United Kingdom's threat to withhold aid===\nIn October 2011, at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|Commonwealth Head of Government's meeting]] in [[Perth]], [[Australia]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[David Cameron]], said that the UK may withhold or reduce aid to governments that do not reform statutes criminalizing homosexuality.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15511081 \"Cameron threat to dock some UK aid to anti-gay nations\", BBC News UK, 30 October 2011]</ref> In response, Tanzania's Minister for Foreign Affairs and international cooperation, [[Bernard Membe]], said,\n\n<blockquote>Tanzania will never accept Cameron's proposal because we have our own moral values. Homosexuality is not part of our culture and we will never legalise it.... We are not ready to allow any rich nation to give us aid based on unacceptable conditions simply because we are poor. If we are denied aid by one country, it will not affect the economic status of this nation and we can do without UK aid.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/201112271071.html \"Tanzania: Africa, Want Aid?

He said:\n\n<blockquote>You are not being fair to me as the government has already made its stand clear on the matter \u2026 but since you want to get my opinion, I would like to say that homosexuality is unacceptable to our society. We need to look critically on these issues. To me this is unacceptable.

Membe said: \"We are ready to lose aid and support from friendly countries that are now pushing for repeal of anti-gay laws in African nations\" and that Tanzania was ready to go it alone rather than being subjected to humiliation and dehumanization.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/201206210145.html \"Tanzania: 'No' to Same Sex Marriages - Govt\", ''Tanzania Daily News'', reprinted in allafrica.com, 21 June 2012]</ref>\n\n==Summary table==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Same-sex sexual activity legal\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]] (Penalty: Up to life imprisonment) \n|-\n| Equal age of consent\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| Anti-discrimination laws in employment only\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| Anti-discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| Anti-discrimination laws in all other areas (Incl. indirect discrimination, hate speech)\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| Same-sex marriages\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| Recognition of same-sex couples \n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| Stepchild adoption by same-sex couples\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| Joint adoption by same-sex couples\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| LGBT people allowed to serve openly in the military\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| Right to change legal gender\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| Access to IVF for lesbians\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|-\n| [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]]s allowed to donate blood\n| [[File:X mark.svg|15px|No]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|LGBT|Tanzania}}\n* [[Human rights in Tanzania]]\n* [[LGBT rights in Africa]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=26em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080526021455/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travelling-and-living-overseas/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/tanzania/?ta=lawsCustoms&pg=3 UK government travel advice for Tanzania: Local laws and customs].

His longest spell at a club was with [[\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw]] with whom he won the [[Ekstraklasa]] and [[Polish SuperCup]]. He played for two teams outside of Poland; [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]] in [[Austria]], who he won the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] with. And had a short spell with [[V\u00e5lerenga I.F. Fotball|V\u00e5lerenga]] in [[Norway]]. Mila was an international for the [[Poland national football team|Poland national team]] getting a total of 38 caps and scoring 8 goals for his national team and was included in the nation's squad for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=90 Minut|title=Sebastian Mila|url=http://www.90minut.pl/kariera.php?id=3055|accessdate=5 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n===Early years===\nBorn in [[Koszalin]], Mila grew up playing for local teams [[Gwardia Koszalin]] and [[Ba\u0142tyk Koszalin]] before he moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]] at the age of 16 and started training with the [[Lechia Gda\u0144sk]] youth teams. Lechia Gda\u0144sk at this time were known as [[Lechia-Polonia Gda\u0144sk]] due to the merger between Lechia Gda\u0144sk and [[Polonia Gda\u0144sk]].\n\n===Lechia Gda\u0144sk===\nMila progressed into the Lechia Gda\u0144sk first team during the 1999\u20132000 season, making his professional debut against [[\u015awit Nowy Dw\u00f3r Mazowiecki]] in March 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lechia.net/mecze-lechii-od-1945/player/23-19992000-ii-liga/1-lechia-gdask/1053-sebastian-mila/|title=Mila: 1999/2000 II Liga|website=lechia.net}}</ref> During his first season playing for Lechia he played in 12 games and scoring two goals in the [[I liga|II liga]]. The following season Mila played 22 times and scoring two goals, being unable to prevent [[Lechia-Polonia Gda\u0144sk]] from being relegated into the third division, a relegation which would result in the break up of the merger and the recreation of Lechia Gda\u0144sk and Polonia Gda\u0144sk in the lower divisions. The relegation saw an exodus of players leaving the club, Mila included.\n\n===Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock===\nMila moved to II liga team Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock during the 2001 summer. During the first half of the season Mila and Wis\u0142a were performing well, with Mila playing 15 of the 19 games. His performances caught the eye of top division team Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski, with Mila making the transfer during the winter transfer window. Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock finished the season runners up, and were promoted to the top division.\n\n===Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski===\nHis move to [[Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski]] saw early success in Mila's career. In his first full season Dyskobolia finished runners up in the [[Ekstraklasa]] resulting in European football for the following season. Mila played in every game of the team's European adventure in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], beating [[FK Atlantas]] and [[Hertha BSC|Hertha Berlin]] before a second round tie with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. After the 0-0 draw at home, it was the away leg which brought Mila to the attention of European and Polish football fans. Mila scored from a free kick against [[David Seaman]] resulting in Dyskobolia progressing due to [[Away goals rule|away goals]]. Dyskobolia faced [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in the next round, and were knocked out losing 5-1 on aggregate. Dyskobolia ended up finishing the season in 4th. The following season started well for Dyskobolia in a season which would see the team finishing runners up in the Ekstraklasa once more, as well as winning the [[Polish Cup]]. Mila played 13 games in the league during the autumn round as well as one game in the successful cup run.\n\n===Austria Vienna===\nDuring the winter break of the 2004\u201305 season Mila moved to [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]]. In his first season with Austria he played 13 times in half a season, during which Austria finished in third place and won the [[Austrian Cup]]. The following season, his first full season at the club, he didn't manage to play any more games than the previous season. Despite not being able to claim a consistent starting position, Mila helped Austria to win the [[2005\u201306 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2005\u201306]] [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] as well as his second [[Austrian Cup]]. The 2006\u201307 season was a turning point for Vienna as a club, with the team not having the same funds as before and many players leaving at the start of the season and during the winter transfer window. After playing 10 games at the start of the season Mila was one of those players to leave in January. Austria struggled for the rest of the season, finishing in a disappointing 6th.\n\n===V\u00e5lerenga & \u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a===\nIn January 2007 Mila joined [[V\u00e5lerenga Fotball|V\u00e5lerenga]] for the [[2007 Tippeligaen]] season. Mila made 14 appearances for V\u00e5lerenga over the course of the season, with the team finishing in 7th. In February 2008 Mila moved back to Poland, moving on loan to [[\u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] for the remainder of the 2007\u201308. Mila played 12 of the remaining 15 fixtures of the season in the Ekstraklasa as he helped the team stay above the relegation zone.\n\n===\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw===\nMila joined newly promoted Ekstraklasa team [[\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw]]. He instantly became a key player for \u015al\u0105sk, and helped the team to win the [[Ekstraklasa Cup]] in the 2008\u201309 season, as well as an impressive 6th place in the league. \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw finished the following season in 9th, with Mila becoming captain for the start of the following season. As captain he led the team finish runners-up in the [[2010\u201311 Ekstraklasa|2010\u201311]] season. The [[2011\u201312 Ekstraklasa|2011\u201312]] season was to be a historic one for \u015al\u0105sk. After qualifying for the [[UEFA Europa League]], \u015al\u0105sk managed to reach the qualification playoff before losing the game to [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucure\u0219ti]]. In the league Mila played 27 of the 30 games as \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw won the league, finishing 1 point ahead of second place [[Ruch Chorz\u00f3w]]. The [[2012\u201313 Ekstraklasa|2012\u201313]] season was Mila's most successful in terms of individual statistics. While leading the team to a [[Polish SuperCup]] win, beating [[Legia Warsaw]], and to a third-place finish in the Ekstraklasa, Mila played 40 games and scored 10 goals in all competitions. The following season saw \u015al\u0105sk struggle, finishing in the relegation group in the league, and finishing in 9th once the season had finished. At the beginning of the 2014\u201315 season Mila played every single game before the winter break. After the team's fortunes and financial status declining, the decision was made to sell Mila during the winter transfer window. Over his 6 and a half seasons at \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw he won three competitions and made 216 and scored 39 goals in all competitions during this time.\n\n===Return to Lechia Gda\u0144sk===\nDuring much of his time at \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw, Mila often wore a Lechia Gda\u0144sk sweat band on his right wrist during games. He often expressed his love for the team he started supporting after his early years at the club, and stated that he wanted to play for the club again.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.przegladsportowy.pl/pilka-nozna/lotto-ekstraklasa/lechia-gdansk/sebastiana-mili-silne-zwiazki-z-gdanskiem-i-lechia-gdansk/45gcy42|title=GDA\u0143SKIE PRZYPADKI SEBASTIANA MILI|website=przegladsportowy.pl}}</ref> This opportunity was given to Mila in January 2015 when he made his return to Lechia after 13 years.<ref>{{cite web|website=skladyfutbol.pl|title=Lechia Gdansk 2014/15|url=http://skladyfutbol.pl/infopage.php?id=7985|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Wirtualna Polska|title=Oficjalnie: Mila w Lechii|url=http://sport.wp.pl/kat,97434,title,Oficjalnie-Mila-w-Lechii,wid,17198672,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=114445&_ticrsn=3|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref> Mila instantly became the Lechia captain, and played 16 games in his first half season back with the team. In his first full season he made 29 appearances with 2 goals, with what became his last professional goal coming against [[Ruch Chorz\u00f3w]]. The following season, 2016\u201317, he made 8 appearances, and in 2017\u201318, one appearance. His final professional appearance came for Lechia Gda\u0144sk against [[G\u00f3rnik Zabrze]] on 5 August 2017, in which he came on as a substitute playing for the final 2 minutes. After his retirement he started working as a football pundit on [[TVP Sport]].\n\n==International career==\nA European U18 Championship winner with Poland in 2001, Mila has 38 caps for the full [[Poland national football team]]. He was selected to the 23-men national team for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] finals in Germany, but did not make an appearance in any of the games. He also participated at the [[1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship]] in New Zealand.<ref>{{FIFA player|175357|Sebastian Mila}}</ref> On 11 October 2014, he scored his first international goal for over six years, finishing off a 2&ndash;0 European qualifying win which was Poland's first ever victory against [[Germany national football team|Germany]], as well as the first win over reigning World Champions in 29 years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Poland make history with Germany

His longest spell at a club was with [[\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw]] with whom he won the [[Ekstraklasa]] and [[Polish SuperCup]]. He played for two teams outside of Poland; [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]] in [[Austria]], who he won the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] with. And had a short spell with [[V\u00e5lerenga I.F. Fotball|V\u00e5lerenga]] in [[Norway]]. Mila was an international for the [[Poland national football team|Poland national team]] getting a total of 38 caps and scoring 8 goals for his national team and was included in the nation's squad for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=90 Minut|title=Sebastian Mila|url=http://www.90minut.pl/kariera.php?id=3055|accessdate=5 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n===Early years===\nBorn in [[Koszalin]], Mila grew up playing for local teams [[Gwardia Koszalin]] and [[Ba\u0142tyk Koszalin]] before he moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]] at the age of 16 and started training with the [[Lechia Gda\u0144sk]] youth teams. Lechia Gda\u0144sk at this time were known as [[Lechia-Polonia Gda\u0144sk]] due to the merger between Lechia Gda\u0144sk and [[Polonia Gda\u0144sk]].\n\n===Lechia Gda\u0144sk===\nMila progressed into the Lechia Gda\u0144sk first team during the 1999\u20132000 season, making his professional debut against [[\u015awit Nowy Dw\u00f3r Mazowiecki]] in March 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lechia.net/mecze-lechii-od-1945/player/23-19992000-ii-liga/1-lechia-gdask/1053-sebastian-mila/|title=Mila: 1999/2000 II Liga|website=lechia.net}}</ref> During his first season playing for Lechia he played in 12 games and scoring two goals in the [[I liga|II liga]]. The following season Mila played 22 times and scoring two goals, being unable to prevent [[Lechia-Polonia Gda\u0144sk]] from being relegated into the third division, a relegation which would result in the break up of the merger and the recreation of Lechia Gda\u0144sk and Polonia Gda\u0144sk in the lower divisions. The relegation saw an exodus of players leaving the club, Mila included.\n\n===Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock===\nMila moved to II liga team Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock during the 2001 summer. During the first half of the season Mila and Wis\u0142a were performing well, with Mila playing 15 of the 19 games. His performances caught the eye of top division team Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski, with Mila making the transfer during the winter transfer window. Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock finished the season runners up, and were promoted to the top division.\n\n===Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski===\nHis move to [[Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski]] saw early success in Mila's career. In his first full season Dyskobolia finished runners up in the [[Ekstraklasa]] resulting in European football for the following season. Mila played in every game of the teams European adventure in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], beating [[FK Atlantas]] and [[Hertha BSC|Hertha Berlin]] before a second round tie with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. After the 0-0 draw at home, it was the away leg which brought Mila to the attention of European and Polish football fans. Mila scored from a free kick against [[David Seaman]] resulting in Dyskobolia progressing due to [[Away goals rule|away goals]]. Dyskobolia faced [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in the next round, and were knocked out losing 5-1 on aggregate. Dyskobolia ended up finishing the season in 4th. The following season started well for Dyskobolia in a season which would see the team finishing runners up in the Ekstraklasa once more, as well as winning the [[Polish Cup]]. Mila played 13 games in the league during the autumn round as well as one game in the successful cup run.\n\n===Austria Vienna===\nDuring the winter break of the 2004\u201305 season Mila moved to [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]]. In his first season with Austria he played 13 times in half a season, during which Austria finished in third place and won the [[Austrian Cup]]. The following season, his first full season at the club, he didn't manage to play any more games than the previous season. Despite not being able to claim a consistent starting position, Mila helped Austria to win the [[2005\u201306 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2005\u201306]] [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] as well as his second [[Austrian Cup]]. The 2006\u201307 season was a turning point for Vienna as a club, with the team not having the same funds as before and many players leaving at the start of the season and during the winter transfer window. After playing 10 games at the start of the season Mila was one of those players to leave in January. Austria struggled for the rest of the season, finishing in a disappointing 6th.\n\n===V\u00e5lerenga & \u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a===\nIn January 2007 Mila joined [[V\u00e5lerenga Fotball|V\u00e5lerenga]] for the [[2007 Tippeligaen]] season. Mila made 14 appearances for V\u00e5lerenga over the course of the season, with the team finishing in 7th. In February 2008 Mila moved back to Poland, moving on loan to [[\u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] for the remainder of the 2007\u201308. Mila played 12 of the remaining 15 fixtures of the season in the Ekstraklasa as he helped the team stay above the relegation zone.\n\n===\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw===\nMila joined newly promoted Ekstraklasa team [[\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw]]. He instantly became a key player for \u015al\u0105sk, and helped the team to win the [[Ekstraklasa Cup]] in the 2008\u201309 season, as well as an impressive 6th place in the league. \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw finished the following season in 9th, with Mila becoming captain for the start of the following season. As captain he led the team finish runners-up in the [[2010\u201311 Ekstraklasa|2010\u201311]] season. The [[2011\u201312 Ekstraklasa|2011\u201312]] season was to be a historic one for \u015al\u0105sk. After qualifying for the [[UEFA Europa League]], \u015al\u0105sk managed to reach the qualification playoff before losing the game to [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucure\u0219ti]]. In the league Mila played 27 of the 30 games as \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw won the league, finishing 1 point ahead of second place [[Ruch Chorz\u00f3w]]. The [[2012\u201313 Ekstraklasa|2012\u201313]] season was Mila's most successful in terms of individual statistics. While leading the team to a [[Polish SuperCup]] win, beating [[Legia Warsaw]], and to a third-place finish in the Ekstraklasa, Mila played 40 games and scored 10 goals in all competitions. The following season saw \u015al\u0105sk struggle, finishing in the relegation group in the league, and finishing in 9th once the season had finished. At the beginning of the 2014\u201315 season Mila played every single game before the winter break. After the teams fortunes and financial status declining, the decision was made to sell Mila during the winter transfer window. Over his 6 and a half seasons at \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw he won three competitions and made 216 and scored 39 goals in all competitions during this time.\n\n===Return to Lechia Gda\u0144sk===\nDuring much of his time at \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw, Mila often wore a Lechia Gda\u0144sk sweat band on his right wrist during games. He often expressed his love for the team he started supporting after his early years at the club, and stated that he wanted to play for the club again.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.przegladsportowy.pl/pilka-nozna/lotto-ekstraklasa/lechia-gdansk/sebastiana-mili-silne-zwiazki-z-gdanskiem-i-lechia-gdansk/45gcy42|title=GDA\u0143SKIE PRZYPADKI SEBASTIANA MILI|website=przegladsportowy.pl}}</ref> This opportunity was given to Mila in January 2015 when he made his return to Lechia after 13 years.<ref>{{cite web|website=skladyfutbol.pl|title=Lechia Gdansk 2014/15|url=http://skladyfutbol.pl/infopage.php?id=7985|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Wirtualna Polska|title=Oficjalnie: Mila w Lechii|url=http://sport.wp.pl/kat,97434,title,Oficjalnie-Mila-w-Lechii,wid,17198672,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=114445&_ticrsn=3|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref> Mila instantly became the Lechia captain, and played 16 games in his first half season back with the team. In his first full season he made 29 appearances with 2 goals, with what became his last professional goal coming against [[Ruch Chorz\u00f3w]]. The following season, 2016\u201317, he made 8 appearances, and in 2017\u201318, one appearance. His final professional appearance came for Lechia Gda\u0144sk against [[G\u00f3rnik Zabrze]] on 5 August 2017, in which he came on as a substitute playing for the final 2 minutes. After his retirement he started working as a football pundit on [[TVP Sport]].\n\n==International career==\nA European U18 Championship winner with Poland in 2001, Mila has 38 caps for the full [[Poland national football team]]. He was selected to the 23-men national team for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] finals in Germany, but did not make an appearance in any of the games. He also participated at the [[1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship]] in New Zealand.<ref>{{FIFA player|175357|Sebastian Mila}}</ref> On 11 October 2014, he scored his first international goal for over

constituencies]] for the city of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[South Wales]], represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) using the [[first-past-the-post]] voting system.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1983\u20131997''': The Borough of Newport wards 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 18 to 20, and the District of Monmouth wards 14 and 15.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The Borough of Newport wards of Alway, Beechwood, Langstone, Liswerry, Llanwern, Ringland, St Julian's, and Victoria, and the Borough of Monmouth wards of [[Caldicot Castle (electoral ward)|Caldicot Castle]], [[Dewstow]], [[Magor with Undy]], Rogiet, [[Severn (Caldicot ward)|Severn]], and West End.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Newport County Borough electoral divisions of Alway, Beechwood, Langstone, Liswerry, Llanwern, Ringland, St Julian's, and Victoria, and the Monmouthshire County electoral divisions of Caldicot Castle, Dewstow, Green Lane, Mill, Rogiet, Severn, The Elms, and West End.\n\n==History==\nNewport East was created when the former [[Newport (Monmouthshire) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport]] [[borough constituency]] was split into two divisions in 1983. It also included some rural areas formerly part of [[Monmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth]] [[county constituency]]. There have been only minor boundary changes since the constituency was created, and unlike the neighbouring [[Newport West (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport West]], has remained Labour since its creation.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n{| class =\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Election !!

{"title_page": "Motets by Johann Sebastian Bach, discography", "text_new": "This article includes a list of commercial recordings of the [[Motet (Bach)|motets]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording with  the [[Bach Collegium Japan]] on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of particular work: given Bach's status as one of the great composers, a firm attribution to him is likely to result in the piece in question being recorded. For example, {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} was not included by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] and the [[Monteverdi Choir]] in their first set recorded in 1980. However, they included it in their 2011 recording,<ref name=\"muzie\">[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref> by which time scholarly opinion had re-assessed the work.\n\nThere has also been interest in recording the less securely attributed and even spurious motets. For example, [[Wolfgang Helbich]] recorded ''The Apocryphal Bach Motets'', sung by the Alsfelder Vokalensemble, in 1993 (released in 1994, re-issued 2014).<ref>[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX3080 ''The Apocryphal Bach Motets: BWV Anh. 159\u2013165''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=1153384 The Sacred Apocryphal Bach (8&nbsp;CD set)] at [[ArkivMusic]] website.</ref>\n\n== Types of choirs ==\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some [[historically informed performance]]s of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are in the minority. Exceptions include the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]'s second set,<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news |last=Clements |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/18/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 |title=Bach: Motets |date=18 May 2007 |work=The Guardian |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> and [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's [[Thomanerchor]], which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. There are three possible approaches: \n*instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing ''[[colla parte]]'' \n*''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an accompaniment\n*Some support for the singers from instruments such as an [[Organ (music)|organ]]\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]] orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two [[oboe]]s, [[Taille (instrument)|taille]] and [[bassoon]]). There is also a [[basso continuo]] (separate [[violone]] and organ parts are provided) which underlies both choirs.<ref name=\"bachchoir\">{{Cite web |url=https://bach.org/education/motet-bwv-226/ |title=Motet BWV 226 |website=Bach Choir of Bethlehem |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nAn accompaniment is also specified for ''Lobet den Herrn''.<ref name=\"Leavis\">{{cite web | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/731829| title=Bach's Setting of Psalm CXVII (BWV.230) | publisher=OUP | work=[[Music & Letters]].

(1974). Bach in Practice. [[The Musical Times]], 115(1578), 661-661. doi:10.2307/960490. Accessed via JSTOR (subscription required)</ref> which is also reflected in recordings. The Hilliard Ensemble's OVPP version is mainly ''a capella''. They omit the instrumental parts of ''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', but sing ''Lobet den Herrn'' to organ accompaniment.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\nThe recordings with continuo accompaniment include The Sixteen's version and the second recording by the Monteverdi Choir.\n\n== History ==\nThe first of the motets to be recorded was [[Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 227|''Jesu meine Freude'']] in 1927. This version was sung in English.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec1.htm|title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 1 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2010, Suzuki and his ensemble were given a French award ([[Diapason d'Or|Diapason d\u2019Or de l\u2019Ann\u00e9e]]) and a German award ([[Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik]]) for their recording of Bach motets on BIS.\n \nJohn Eliot Gardiner, who has won more [[Gramophone Classical Music Awards|Gramophone Awards]] than any other living artist, received one for his second recording of the motets with the Monteverdi Choir on SDG.

Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording with  the [[Bach Collegium Japan]] on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of particular work: given Bach's status as one of the great composers, a firm attribution to him is likely to result in the piece in question being recorded. For example, {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} was not included by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] and the [[Monteverdi Choir]] in their first set recorded in 1980. However, they included it in their 2011 recording.<ref name=\"muzie\">[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref>\n\nThere has also been interest in recording the less securely attributed and even spurious motets. For example, [[Wolfgang Helbich]] recorded ''The Apocryphal Bach Motets'', sung by the Alsfelder Vokalensemble, in 1993 (released in 1994, re-issued 2014).<ref>[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX3080 ''The Apocryphal Bach Motets: BWV Anh. 159\u2013165''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=1153384 The Sacred Apocryphal Bach (8&nbsp;CD set)] at [[ArkivMusic]] website.</ref>\n\n== Types of choirs ==\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some [[historically informed performance]]s of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are in the minority.

This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. There are three possible approaches: \n*instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing ''[[colla parte]]'' \n*''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an accompaniment\n*Some support for the singers from instruments such as an [[Organ (music)|organ]]\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]] orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two [[oboe]]s, [[Taille (instrument)|taille]] and [[bassoon]]). There is also a [[basso continuo]] (separate [[violone]] and organ parts are provided) which underlies both choirs.<ref name=\"bachchoir\">{{Cite web |url=https://bach.org/education/motet-bwv-226/ |title=Motet BWV 226 |website=Bach Choir of Bethlehem |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nAn accompaniment is also specified for ''Lobet den Herrn''.<ref name=\"Leavis\">{{cite web | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/731829| title=Bach's Setting of Psalm CXVII (BWV.230) | publisher=OUP | work=[[Music & Letters]].
