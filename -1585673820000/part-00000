Nexstar is precluded from acquiring WXIN and WTTV/WTTK directly or indirectly, as FCC regulations prohibit common ownership of more than two stations in the same media market, or two or more of the four highest-rated stations in the market. (Furthermore, any attempt by Nexstar to assume the operations of WXIN and WTTV/WTTK through [[local marketing agreement|local marketing]] or [[shared services]] agreements may be subject to regulatory hurdles that could delay completion of the FCC and Justice Department's review and approval process for the acquisition.) As such, Nexstar was required to sell two of the stations (including one ranking in the top four in ratings; WTTV and WTTK counting as one station) to a separate, unrelated company to address the ownership conflict, potentially creating two new duopolies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Acquisition of Tribune Media Company|url=https://www.nexstar.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nexstar-Tribune-Investor-Presentation-FINAL-12-3-18.pdf|website=[[Nexstar Media Group]]|format=[[PDF]]|date=December 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nexstar Buying Tribune Media For $6.4 Billion|url=https://tvnewscheck.com/article/top-news/226264/nexstar-buying-tribune-media-6-4-billion/|author=Mark K.

WNDY carried the [[CBS This Morning#Saturday edition|Saturday edition]] of ''[[CBS This Morning]]'', with the last broadcast on December 27, 2014, and the [[CBS Weekend News|weekend editions]] of the ''[[CBS Evening News]]''  and the second half-hour of ''[[Face the Nation]]'' both ending on December 28, 2014, in lieu of WISH-TV (in the case of the former two programs, WISH declined to air them in order to run expanded Saturday morning and weekend 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts). Occasionally as time permitted, WNDY aired other CBS programs that WISH-TV was unable to air due to extended breaking news or severe weather coverage, or other special programming, including certain [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Basketball Championship]] games when more than one team of local interest is playing. As a result of WISH-TV losing the CBS affiliation, WNDY also stopped airing select CBS programs after December 28, 2014 (WTTV cleared the entire CBS schedule upon joining the network on [[New Year's Day|January 1]], 2015).\n\nThe [[Hoosier Lottery]] awarded WNDY the rights to televise its daily drawings the following year, assuming the contract from WTTV, which had been airing the drawings since 1989; WTTV would regain the broadcast contact to the drawings in 1999, before losing them again when the lottery discontinued the televised draws in 2001.\n\n===Sports programming===\nIn 1995, the [[Indiana High School Athletic Association]] awarded WNDY the broadcast contract to air the statewide boys and girls [[high school basketball]] tournament games; after the station terminated its contract with the IHSAA in August 1999 due to declining overall interest in the tournament, the organization filed a [[breach of contract]] lawsuit against WNDY in March 2000, seeking $3.28 million in damages.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160309060910/https://business.highbeam.com/5280/article-1P3-51060853/ihsaa-seeking-33m-tv-suit IHSAA seeking $33M in TV suit], ''Indianapolis Business Journal''.

WISH will have a Sunday-only schedule of games due to the contractual restrictions of their CW affiliation, with WNDY airing the remainder of the weekday schedule of games and a few Sundays.

The program originally competed against two longer-established 10&nbsp;p.m. newscasts: WXIN's then 35-minute in-house newscast and another outsourced newscast on WTTV that was produced by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WRTV]] (channel 6) (the latter newscast was cancelled in December 2002, after WXIN owner Tribune Broadcasting acquired WTTV).\n\nWTHR terminated the news share agreement after WNDY was acquired by LIN TV; WISH-TV assumed production responsibilities for the newscast on February 28, 2005, relaunching the program as ''24-Hour News 8 at 10:00 on UPN Indiana'' (as was the case under the WTHR news share agreement, the program's title was later revised slightly to correspond with WNDY's branding changes to \"WNDY UPN\" in September 2005 and then \"My INDY TV\" upon the station's switch to MyNetworkTV in September 2006). The WNDY newscast briefly gained another competitor on that date when WTHR moved the ''Eyewitness News at 10:00'' broadcast to sister station [[WALV-CD]] (channel 46); that program was subsequently moved to Pax TV [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WIPX-TV]] (channel 63, now an [[Ion Television]] O&O) on April 13, 2005, before being cancelled two months later on June 30.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eyewitness News at 10 on WIPX-TV|url=http://www.wthr.com/article/eyewitness-news-at-10-on-wipx-tv|author=Kyle Thomas|website=[[WTHR]]|publisher=[[Dispatch Broadcast Group]]|date=March 4, 2005|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}</ref> On September 8, 2008, WISH-TV became the second television station in the state of Indiana and the Indianapolis [[media market|market]] to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]; the WNDY newscast was included in the upgrade.\n\nOn January 5, 2009, WISH-TV began producing an hour-long extension of its weekday morning newscast for WNDY, running from 7 to 8&nbsp;a.m. The station also began producing a weekly interview program produced by WISH, ''One on One with [[Mike Ahern (news anchor)|Mike Ahern]]'', which was hosted by the former WISH-TV anchor; airing Thursdays at 10:30&nbsp;p.m. (with a rebroadcast Saturdays at 7&nbsp;p.m.), the program was cancelled in mid-2013. In 2012, the Sunday edition of the 10&nbsp;p.m. newscast was expanded to one hour; the Monday through Saturday editions would follow suit on January 6, 2014, with the final 15 minutes of the program being padded out by a sports highlight program titled ''Sports Zone Tonight''.<ref>[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/73057/wish-expands-its-10-pm-news-on-wndy WISH Expands Its 10 P.M.

WNDY carried the [[CBS This Morning#Saturday edition|Saturday edition]] of ''[[CBS This Morning]]'', with the last broadcast on December 27, 2014, and the [[CBS Weekend News|weekend editions]] of the ''[[CBS Evening News]]''  and the second half-hour of ''[[Face the Nation]]'' both ending on December 28, 2014, in lieu of WISH-TV (in the case of the former two programs, WISH declined to air them in order to run expanded Saturday morning and weekend 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts). Occasionally as time permitted, WNDY aired other CBS programs that WISH-TV was unable to air due to extended breaking news or severe weather coverage, or other special programming, including certain [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Basketball Championship]] games when more than one team of local interest is playing. As a result of WISH-TV losing the CBS affiliation, WNDY also stopped airing select CBS programs after December 28, 2014 (WTTV cleared the entire CBS schedule upon joining the network on [[New Year's Day|January 1]], 2015).\n\nThe [[Hoosier Lottery]] awarded WNDY the rights to televise its daily drawings the following year, assuming the contract from WTTV, which had been airing the drawings since 1989; WTTV would regain the broadcast contact to the drawings in 1999, before losing them again when the lottery discontinued the televised draws in 2001.\n\n===Sports programming===\nIn 1995, the [[Indiana High School Athletic Association]] awarded WNDY the broadcast contract to air the statewide boys and girls [[high school basketball]] tournament games; after the station terminated its contract with the IHSAA in August 1999 due to declining overall interest in the tournament, the organization filed a [[breach of contract]] lawsuit against WNDY in March 2000, seeking $3.28 million in damages.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160309060910/https://business.highbeam.com/5280/article-1P3-51060853/ihsaa-seeking-33m-tv-suit IHSAA seeking $33M in TV suit], ''Indianapolis Business Journal''.

One notable exception to this occurred in October 2013, when [[WTHR]] (channel 13) carried an ESPN-televised Monday night game involving the Colts.<ref>[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/69496/wthr-to-air-two-indianapolis-colts-games WTHR To Air Two Indianapolis Colts Games], ''TVNewsCheck'', August 6, 2013.</ref> The station also airs selected [[Ball State University]] men's [[college basketball|basketball]] games as well as [[Mid-American Conference]] [[college football]] from [[ESPN Events|ESPN Plus]].\n\nIn March 2015, Media General announced that WISH and WNDY would become part of the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] broadcast television networks and carry many of the games the teams will broadcast locally in [[Chicago]] among [[WLS-TV]], [[WGN-TV]] and [[WPWR-TV]], though not those broadcast by [[NBC Sports Chicago]]. WISH will have a Sunday-only schedule of games due to the contractual restrictions of their CW affiliation, with WNDY airing the remainder of the weekday schedule of games and a few Sundays. The deal for carriage of the games in Indianapolis was required after [[Tribune Media]] discontinued airing Chicago area sports over [[WGN America]] at the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/83915/wishwndy-to-carry-cubs-white-sox|title=WISH-WNDY To Carry Cubs, White Sox|last=Staff report|date=March 20, 2015|publisher=TVNewsCheck|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref> In October 2015, this agreement was expanded to include select [[Chicago Blackhawks]] hockey games as well.<ref>[http://wishtv.com/2015/10/05/wish-tv-and-myindy-tv-the-new-home-of-chicago-blackhawks-hockey], ''WISH-TV''.

The program originally competed against two longer-established 10&nbsp;p.m. newscasts: WXIN's then 35-minute in-house newscast and another outsourced newscast on WTTV that was produced by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WRTV]] (channel 6) (the latter newscast was cancelled in December 2002, after WXIN owner Tribune Broadcasting acquired WTTV).\n\nWTHR terminated the news share agreement after WNDY was acquired by LIN TV; WISH-TV assumed production responsibilities for the newscast on February 28, 2005, relaunching the program as ''24-Hour News 8 at 10:00 on UPN Indiana'' (as was the case under the WTHR news share agreement, the program's title was later revised slightly to correspond with WNDY's branding changes to \"WNDY UPN\" in September 2005 and then \"My INDY TV\" upon the station's switch to MyNetworkTV in September 2006). The WNDY newscast briefly gained another competitor on that date when WTHR moved the ''Eyewitness News at 10:00'' broadcast to sister station [[WALV-CD]] (channel 46); that program was subsequently moved to Pax TV [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WIPX-TV]] (channel 63, now an [[Ion Television]] O&O) on April 13, 2005, before being cancelled two months later on June 30.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eyewitness News at 10 on WIPX-TV|url=http://www.wthr.com/article/eyewitness-news-at-10-on-wipx-tv|author=Kyle Thomas|website=[[WTHR]]|publisher=[[Dispatch Broadcast Group]]|date=March 4, 2005|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}</ref> On September 8, 2008, WISH-TV became the second television station in the state of Indiana and the Indianapolis [[media market|market]] to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]; the WNDY newscast was included in the upgrade.\n\nOn January 5, 2009, WISH-TV began producing an hour-long extension of its weekday morning newscast for WNDY, running from 7 to 8&nbsp;a.m. The station also began producing a weekly interview program produced by WISH, ''One on One with [[Mike Ahern (news anchor)|Mike Ahern]]'', which was hosted by the former WISH-TV anchor; airing Thursdays at 10:30&nbsp;p.m. (with a rebroadcast Saturdays at 7&nbsp;p.m.), the program was cancelled in mid-2013. In 2012, the Sunday edition of the 10&nbsp;p.m. newscast was expanded to one hour; the Monday through Saturday editions would follow suit on January 6, 2014, with the final 15 minutes of the program being padded out by a sports highlight program titled ''Sports Zone Tonight''.<ref>[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/73057/wish-expands-its-10-pm-news-on-wndy WISH Expands Its 10 P.M.

It evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]] and was succeeded by [[Renaissance architecture]]. Originating in 12th century [[France]] and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as ''{{lang|la|Opus Francigenum}}'' (\"French work\") with the term ''Gothic'' first appearing during the later part of the [[Renaissance]]. \n\nThe defining element of Gothic architecture is the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]]. It is the primary engineering innovation and the characteristic design component. The use of the pointed arch in turn led to the development of the pointed [[ribbed vault]], the [[flying buttress]] and window tracery.<ref>Bannister Fletcher, 17th edition, p.367, p.524</ref> These elements together formed a structurally and aesthetically integrated system, or style, that characterises the Gothic.<ref>Moffett, Fazio and Wodehouse, p.230</ref>\n\nAt the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, the choir was reconstructed between 1140 and 1144, drawing together for the first time the developing Gothic architectural features. In doing so, a new architectural style emerged that emphasised, internally, verticality in the structural members, and the atmosphere created by the play of light through [[stained glass window]]s.{{sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nGothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great [[cathedral]]s, [[abbey]]s and churches of Europe. It is also the architecture of many [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[town hall]]s, [[Guild|guild halls]], universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings. Many of the finest examples of Gothic architecture are listed with [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s. \n\nWith the development of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Italy during the mid 15th century, the Gothic style was supplanted by the new style, but in some regions, notably England, Gothic continued to flourish and develop into the 16th century. A series of [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revivals]] began in mid-18th century England, spread through 19th century Europe and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.\n\n==Name==\nGothic architecture was known during the period as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} (\"French/[[Franks|Frankish]] work\") {{sfn|Jones|1999|p=90|ps=: \"The style was widely referred to as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} - \"[[Franks]]' work\".\"}} and in France as the ''Style Ogivale'' (style with pointed arches).<ref>Bannister Fletcher, p.524</ref>\n\nThe term \"[[Gothic (disambiguation)|Gothic]] architecture\" originated as a [[pejorative]] description. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term \"barbarous German style\" in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style,<ref name=vas>[[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari, G]]. ''The Lives of the Artists''. Translated with an introduction and notes by J.C. and [[Peter Bondanella|P. Bondanella]]. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]] (Oxford World\u2019s Classics), 1991, pp. 117 & 527. {{ISBN|9780199537198}}</ref> and in the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributes various architectural features to \"the Goths\" whom he holds responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered Rome, and erecting new ones in this style.<ref>Vasari, Giorgio.

[[Gerard Baldwin Brown|G. Baldwin Brown]] Ed. Louisa S. Maclehose Trans. London: Dent, pp. b & 83.</ref> At the time in which Vasari was writing, Italy had experienced a century of building in the Classical architectural vocabulary revived in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and seen as evidence of a new [[Golden Age]] of learning and refinement.

Authorities such as [[Christopher Wren]] lent their aid in deprecating the old medieval style, which they termed Gothic, as synonymous with everything that was barbarous and rude.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">''[[Notes and Queries]]'', No. 9. 29 December 1849</ref><ref name=\"Ref_c\">[[Christopher Wren]], 17th-century architect of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]].</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Definition and scope==\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}} \n\nGothic architecture is the architecture of the late medieval period, characterised by use of the pointed arch.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Other features common to Gothic architecture are the rib vault, buttresses, including flying buttresses; large windows which are often grouped, or have tracery; rose windows, towers, spires and pinnacles; and ornate west fronts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAs an architectural style, Gothic developed primarily in ecclesiastical architecture,{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} and its principles and characteristic forms were applied to other types of buildings. Buildings of every type were constructed in the Gothic style, with evidence remaining of simple domestic buildings, elegant town houses, grand palaces, commercial premises, civic buildings, castles, city walls, bridges, village churches, abbey churches, abbey complexes and large cathedrals.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe greatest number of surviving Gothic buildings are churches. These range from tiny chapels to large cathedrals, and although many have been extended and altered in different styles, a large number remain either substantially intact or sympathetically restored, demonstrating the form, character and decoration of Gothic architecture.

Civic building was of great importance to these towns as a sign of wealth and pride. England and France remained largely [[Feudalism|feudal]] and produced grand domestic architecture for their kings, dukes and bishops, rather than grand town halls for their burghers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Religious===\nThe [[Catholic Church]] prevailed across Western Europe at this time, influencing not only faith but also wealth and power. Bishops were appointed by the feudal lords (kings, dukes and other landowners) and they often ruled as virtual princes over large estates.  The early Medieval periods had seen a rapid growth in monasticism, with several different orders being prevalent and spreading their influence widely. Foremost were the [[Benedictines]] whose great abbey churches vastly outnumbered any others in France and England. A part of their influence was that towns developed around them and they became centres of culture, learning and commerce. The [[Cluniacs|Cluniac]] and Cistercian Orders were prevalent in France, the great monastery at [[Cluny]] having established a formula for a well planned monastic site which was then to influence all subsequent monastic building for many centuries.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JH1>John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century [[St. Francis of Assisi]] established the [[Franciscans]], or so-called \"Grey Friars\", a mendicant order. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], another mendicant order founded during the same period but by [[St. Dominic]] in [[Toulouse]] and [[Bologna]], were particularly influential in the building of Italy's Gothic churches.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JH1>John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''</ref>\n\n===Geographic===\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style.<ref name=BF/> On the other hand, some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic.<ref name=JH1/>\n\nThe local availability of materials affected both construction and style. In France, [[limestone]] was readily available in several grades, the very fine white limestone of [[Caen]] being favoured for sculptural decoration.  England had coarse limestone and red [[sandstone]] as well as dark green [[Purbeck marble]] which was often used for architectural features.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn Northern Germany, Netherlands, northern Poland, Denmark, and the Baltic countries local building stone was unavailable but there was a strong tradition of building in brick. The resultant style, [[Brick Gothic]], is called \"Backsteingotik\" in Germany and Scandinavia and is associated with the Hanseatic League.  In Italy, stone was used for fortifications, but brick was preferred for other buildings. Because of the extensive and varied deposits of marble, many buildings were faced in marble, or were left with undecorated fa\u00e7ade so that this might be achieved at a later date.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe availability of timber also influenced the style of architecture, with timber buildings prevailing in Scandinavia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Availability of timber affected methods of roof construction across Europe. It is thought that the magnificent [[hammer-beam]] roofs of England were devised as a direct response to the lack of long straight seasoned timber by the end of the Medieval period, when forests had been decimated not only for the construction of vast roofs but also for ship building.<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT>Alec Clifton-Taylor, ''The Cathedrals of England''</ref>\n\n==Architectural background and early development== \n\n===Oriental influence===\nThe pointed arch, one of the defining attributes of Gothic, was employed in Late Roman and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] architecture by the 7th century.

In the Sassanid architecture of Iran, parabolic and pointed arches were employed in both palace and sacred construction.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Warren\n | first = John\n | year = 1991\n | title = Creswell's Use of the Theory of Dating by the Acuteness of the Pointed Arches in Early Muslim Architecture\n | periodical = Muqarnas\n | volume = 8\n | pages = 59\u201365 (61\u201363)\n | doi = 10.2307/1523154\n | jstor = 1523154\n | publisher=BRILL\n}}</ref><ref>Petersen, Andrew (2002-03-11).

For the most part, there was not a clean break, as there was to be later in [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] with the revival of the [[Classical style]] in the early 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nBy the 12th century, Romanesque architecture (termed [[Norman architecture]] in England because of its association with the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]]), was established throughout Europe. The important categories of building: the [[cathedral]] church, the [[parish church]], the [[abbey church]], the [[monastery]], the [[castle]], the [[palace]], the [[great hall]], the [[gatehouse]], the [[town hall|civic building]] and the [[warehouse]], had been established in the Romanesque period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nMany architectural features that are associated with Gothic architecture had been developed and used by the architects of Romanesque buildings, particularly in the building of cathedrals and abbey churches.. These include [[ribbed vault]]s, [[buttress]]es, clustered columns, ambulatories, [[Rose window|wheel windows]], spires, stained glass windows, and richly carved door tympana. These were already features of ecclesiastical architecture before the development of the Gothic style, and all were to develop in increasingly elaborate ways.<ref name=NP>Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture''.</ref>\n\nIt was principally the widespread introduction of a single feature, the pointed arch, which was to bring about the change that separates Gothic from Romanesque. This technological change permitted both structural and stylistic change which broke the tradition of massive masonry and solid walls penetrated by small openings, replacing it with a style where light appears to triumph over substance. With its use came the development of many other architectural devices, previously put to the test in scattered buildings and then called into service to meet the structural, aesthetic and ideological needs of the new style. These include the flying buttresses, pinnacles and traceried windows which typify Gothic ecclesiastical architecture.<ref name=BF/>\n\n===Transition from Romanesque to Gothic architecture=== \nThe characteristic forms that were to define Gothic architecture developed in Romanesque buildings at different locations, as the result of structural requirements.\n\nAlthough the pointed arch is strongly associated with the Gothic style, it was first used in Western architecture in buildings that were in other ways clearly Romanesque, notably [[Autun Cathedral]] in France, [[Durham Cathedral]] in the north of England, and [[Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9|Cefal\u00f9]] and [[Monreale Cathedral]]s in Sicily.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe vaults of most Romanesque churches were barrel vaults or groin vaults. By the early 12th century the ribbed vaults, characteristic of Gothic architecture, were coming into use. They appeared at the naves of two Romanesque churches in Caen, France, the [[Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen|Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and the [[Abbaye aux Dames]] in 1120. The ribbed vault over the north transept at [[Durham Cathedral]] in England, built from 1128 to 1133, was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault. Pointed ribbed vaults were used in the chancel of [[Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9]] in 1131.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe three-tiered interior elevation of arcade, gallery and clerestory that is typical of great Gothic churches, was well established in the Norman buildings of England, appearing at [[norwich Cathedral|Norwich]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] and Durham Cathedrals as well as the Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen, in France.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nOne of the features that unifies the internal appearance of a great Gothic church is the emphasis on vertical elements, in particular attached shafts that pass from the floor to the vault.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} These first appeared in France in the early 11th century in churches that have broad ribs reinforcing a barrel vault. They are also seen at [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey|la Madeleine Vezelay]] in conjunction with groin vaults, as well as at the three Norman cathedrals of East Anglia, of which Peterborough and Ely retain wooden ceilings, while Norwich was not vaulted until the 15th century.\n\nThe admission of light to the building through a multiplicity of windows was an important element in England. At Peterborough Cathedral, the polygonal Norman apse has remained, as has three tiers of large Norman windows, now filled with Gothic tracery and 19th century stained glass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The transept ends at Peterborough, Ely and Norwich each have three rows of large Norman windows. This grouping of windows prefigures the clusters of Gothic lancet windows that are found in many English churches such [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Rose window]]s, which are characteristic of the west fronts and transept ends of the cathedrals of France, were in the Romanesque period, common in architecture of Germany, where they appear in various forms at [[Worms Cathedral]], and in Italy where they are either untraceried ocula or wheel windows such as that at the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], Verona. The first rose window above the west portal in France is said to be that at the [[Basilica of Saint Denis|Abbaye Saint-Denis]] 1140. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] is generally cited as the first truly Gothic building, however the distinction is best reserved for the choir, of which the [[ambulatory]] remains intact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} [[Noyon Cathedral]] saw the earliest completion of a rebuilding of an entire French cathedral in the new style from 1150 to 1231.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} While using all those features that came to be known as Gothic, including pointed arches, flying buttresses and ribbed vaulting, the builders continued to employ many of the features and much of the character of Romanesque architecture including round-headed arch throughout the building, varying the shape to pointed where it was functionally practical to do so.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt the Abbey Saint-Denis, [[Sens Cathedral]], Noyon Cathedral, [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England, simple cylindrical columns predominate over the Gothic forms of clustered columns and shafted piers. [[Wells Cathedral]] in England, commenced at the eastern end in 1175, was the first building in which the designer broke free from Romanesque forms. The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by Adam Locke in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic. Wells Cathedral is thus considered the first truly Gothic cathedral.<ref>Cannon, J. 2007. Cathedral: The Great English Cathedrals and the World that Made Them</ref> \n\n<!---Needs icorporating-  The first cathedral in France built entirely in the new style was  [[Sens Cathedral]], begun between 1135 and 1140 and consecrated in 1160.{{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}<ref> ''Le Guide du Patrimoine de France'' (2002) pg. 53</ref>  Sens Cathedral  features a Gothic choir, and six-part rib vaults over the nave and collateral aisles, alternating pillars and doubled columns to support the vaults, and buttresses to offset the outward thrust from the vaults.  One of the builders who is believed to have worked on Sens Cathedral, [[William of Sens]], later traveled to England and became the architect who, between 1175 and 1180, reconstructed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in the new Gothic style. {{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}\n\nSens was quickly followed by  [[Senlis Cathedral]] (begun 1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 36</ref>  --->\n\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | perrow    = 4\n | total_width= \n\n | image1    = Ely Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1766558.jpg\n | width1    = 168\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The south western tower at Ely Cathedral, England\n\n | image2    = Durham.2 crop.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The nave vault with pointed transverse arches at Durham Cathedral\n\n | image3    = Abbaye aux hommes int\u00e9rieur 03.jpeg\n | width3    = 170\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = The sexpartite ribbed vault at Saint Etienne, Caen\n\n | image4    = Cefalu Cathedral interior BW 2012-10-11 12-07-53.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = interior of the [[Cathedral of Cefalu]].\n}}\n\n===Abbot Suger===\nThe eastern end of the [[St Denis Basilica|Basilica Church of Saint-Denis]], built by [[Abbot Suger]] and completed in 1144, is often cited as the first truly Gothic building, as it draws together many of architectural forms which had evolved from the Romanesque and typify the Gothic style.\n\nSuger, friend and confidant of the French Kings, [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], decided in about 1137, to rebuild the great Church of Saint-Denis, attached to an abbey which was also a royal residence. He began with the West Front, reconstructing the original [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] fa\u00e7ade with its single door. He designed the west front of Saint-Denis to be an echo of the Roman [[Triumphal Arch of Constantine|Arch of Constantine]] with its three-part division and three large portals to ease the problem of congestion. The [[rose window]] is the earliest-known example above the West portal in France. The fa\u00e7ade combines both round arches and pointed arches of the Gothic style.\n\nAt the completion of the west front in 1140, Abbot Suger moved on to the reconstruction of the eastern end, leaving the Carolingian nave in use. He designed a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] that would be suffused with light.<ref name=\"Ref_f\">[[Erwin Panofsky]] argued that Suger was inspired to create a physical representation of the Heavenly [[Jerusalem]], although the extent to which Suger had any aims higher than aesthetic pleasure has been called into doubt by more recent art historians on the basis of Suger's own writings.</ref> To achieve his aims, his masons drew on the several new features which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture, the pointed arch, the ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], the ambulatory with radiating chapels, the clustered columns supporting ribs springing in different directions and the flying buttresses which enabled the insertion of large ''clerestory'' windows.\n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].<ref name=gothicplantagenet/><ref name=JH1/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | perrow    = 6\n | total_width \n | image1    = Saint-Denis - Basilique - Ext\u00e9rieur fa\u00e7ade ouest.JPG\n | width1    = 175\n | height1    = \n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The west front at the Abbey of Saint Denis, with its three deep portals\n | image2    = Basilica Saint Denis ambulatory.JPG\n | width2    = 160\n | height2    = \n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The ambulatory at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|Abbey of Saint-Denis]]\n | image3    = PM 103495 F Sens.jpg\n | width3    = 142 \n | height3   =\n | alt3      = \n | caption3   = The choir of Sens Cathedral \n | image4    = PM 103531 F Sens.jpg\n | width4    = 150 \n | height4   =\n | alt4      = \n | caption4   = The nave of Sens Cathedral \n | image5    = Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG\n | width5    = 155\n | height5    = \n | alt5      = \n | caption5  = The west front at Noyon Cathedral, showing transitional characteristics\n | image6    =Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (Noyon)-Abside et ch\u0153ur adjusted.jpg\n | width6    = 155\n | height6    = \n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The interior of Noyon Cathedral\n }}\n\n==Importance of cathedrals and great churches in Gothic architecture==\nWhile many secular buildings exist from the Late Middle Ages, it is in the buildings of cathedrals and great churches that Gothic architecture displays its pertinent structures and characteristics to the fullest advantage.

There are several regional variations on this plan. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing, and in England is often surmounted by a stone tower, as at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[York Minster]], visible on a groundplan by the sturdy piers that support the tower. (see below){{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe nave is generally flanked on either side by aisles, usually single as at York Minster and [[Florence Cathedral]] but sometimes double as at [[bourges Cathedral|Bourges]] and [[Cologne Cathedral]]s. (see plans below). Aisles may extend along the sides of the transepts as well, as at Cologne, [[Amiens Cathedral]] and York Minster.(see plans) In the South of France there is often a single wide nave and no aisles, as at [[Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges]] and [[Albi Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some churches with double aisles, or additional rows of chapels between the buttresses as at [[Notre Dame, Paris]], the transept does not project beyond the aisles (See plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In English cathedrals, transepts tend to project boldly and there may be two of them, as at Salisbury and [[Lincoln Cathedral]]s. The double transepts are to provide extra chapels, in lieu of the apsidal chapels found in French cathedrals (See Salisbury plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In France and Germany, the eastern end is generally polygonal and surrounded by a continuation of the choir aisle called an [[ambulatory]]. Surrounding the ambulatory may be a ring of chapels called a \"[[chevet]]\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn England the eastern arm is generally long and may have two distinct sections- choir and presbytery. It is almost always square ended with a cliff-like exterior face. Often there is a projecting ''Lady Chapel'', dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], as at Salisbury.<ref name=BF/><ref name=NP/><ref name=Swaan/>\n\nIn Italy, the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually a shallow chapel, as at [[Santa Maria Novella]], or sometimes an apsidal end containing the sanctuary, as at [[Florence Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}.\n\nThe groundplans of the cathedrals show not only the larger parts of the building, developed for [[Catholic liturgy]]- the nave, aisles, transept, choir and chapels - but also reveal that each building contains a pattern of regular divisions called \"bays\". These bays or compartments are square, rectangular and sometimes trapezoidal, and are defined by the positions of the piers, columns and attached shafts that support the arcades and the overhead vaults. While internally the divisions are created by the locations of the vertical members, externally, the bays can be determined by the positions of the buttresses.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=14, 17}}\n\nOther elements that are visible on the plans are the locations of towers on the west fronts, porches such as those at Bourges and Salisbury, and the octagonal [[Chapter House]] at York Minster.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =\n | image1    = Plan.cathedrale.Bourges.png\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = [[Bourges Cathedral]], France, length 125 m.\n | image2    = Plan.redress\u00e9.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = [[Notre Dame de Paris]], France, length 128 m.\n | width2    = 210\n | image3    = Amiens plan vert.png\n | width3    = 170\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = [[Amiens Cathedral]], France, length 145 m.\n | image4    = Plan.cathedrale.Cologne.png\n | width4    = 262\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = [[Cologne Cathedral]], Germany, length 144 m, completed C19th, to dimensions established in C14th \n | image5    = Salisbury cathedral plan vert.jpg\n | width5    = 170\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = [[Salisbury Cathedral]], England, length 135 m\n | image6    = YorkMinsterPlanDehio vert.jpg\n | width6    = 265\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = [[York Minster]], England, length 159 m\n }}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Elevation===\nThe most common elevation for a Gothic cathedral is that of the architectural form known as the \"basilica\". This term, used architecturally, does not have any ecclesiastical or spiritual significance such as is associated with Catholic basilicas that have been designated by the pope as a church of great significance, e.g. the [[Basilica of St Peter]], in Rome, or the [[Rosary Basilica|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary]] at Lourdes. (see [[Papal Basilica]] and [[Minor Basilica]])\n\nArchitecturally, a basilica is a church that has a longitudinal nave, with a lower aisle on each side, separated by rows of columns or piers, and generally with windows let into that part of the nave that rises above the outer roof of the aisles. This upper section is called the [[clerestorey]]. This architectural form is so named because it was commonly used by ancient Roman builders as the structure for secular [[Roman basilica|basilicas]] used as halls for meetings, markets and as places of justice. Early Christian churches such as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, and [[San Apollinare in Classe]] have this form, which was adopted by Romanesque builders for their great abbeys and cathedrals, across Europe, such as Durham Cathedral, Saint-Etienne, Caen, and Monreale Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the Gothic period, most cathedrals were built with a single aisle on each side of the nave, such as Salisbury Cathedral, but some had double aisles with the outer lower than the inner, such as Bourges Cathedral. In the South of France cathedrals are sometimes just a single high, wide hall, with tall windows but no aisles, and the lower stage giving a robust fortified appearance, such as [[Albi Cathedral]]. Gothic churches of the Germanic tradition, like [[Stephansdom (Vienna)|St. Stephen of Vienna]], often have nave and aisles of similar height, without clerestoreys, and are called ''[[Hall church|Hallenkirche]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nInternally, the nave and choir are usually divided horizontally into three stages, the arcade, the triforium gallery and the clerestorey. This arrangement is usual in England where it can be seen at Salisbury, Lincoln, and Ely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some French Cathedrals, such as Laon and the nave of Rouen, there is a fourth stage, a shallow tribune gallery between the triforium and the clerestorey.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  In the transepts of Notre Dame, the wall above the triforium gallery is pierced with rose windows.  In later Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches, the vertical members in the tracery of galleries and clerestorey may merge into a single decorative unit where the stages are present but not clearly defined, as at Saint Ouen at Rouen and the choir of Gloucester Cathedral in England. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn the Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches of Italy, triforium galleries are most often found in churches influenced by the arhitecture of Normandy, and were used at abbeys of women, as a space for the nuns to attend services.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Elsewhere, many churches such as Florence Cathedral and the Abbey Church of Santa Maria Novella, had an interior alavation of two stages, the arcade and clerestorey. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = French Gothic elevations\n | image1    = Notre Dame 531 transverse crop rot.jpg\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame de Paris, showing the nave and double aisles; vault and flying buttresses.\n | image2    =Vue.interieure.travee.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | width2    = 183\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Notre Dame de Paris.

One of the best known and most typical of such west fronts is that of Notre Dame de Paris.  To emphasise its importance, the west front may be of a powerful design, with towers, imposing portals, jutting buttresses, gables, windows and an array of sculpture. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nCentral to the west front is the main portal, often flanked by additional doors, after the manner of Suger's west front at the Basilica of Saint Denis. In England, the lateral doors may be present but relatively insignificant. In the arch of the central door, particularly in France, the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], is often a significant piece of sculpture, most frequently ''Christ in Majesty'' or ''the [[Last Judgment]]''. If there is a central doorjamb or a [[Trumeau (architecture)|trumeau]], then it frequently bears a statue of Jesus or the ''Madonna and Child'' if the dedication is to Mary.  Figures in niches set into the mouldings around the portals.  \n\nAbove the main portal there is a large window which lights the nave. In France and Spain this is generally a [[rose window]] as at Notre Dame de Paris and [[Burgos Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In Italy there is generally an untraceried ocular window as at Santa Maria Novella.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, rose windows are rare and the west end is generally dominated by a  single very large traceried window as at York Minster and Canterbury, while some Early English fronts retain rows of lancet windows as at Salisbury and [[Ripon Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe west front of most French cathedrals and many English, Spanish and German cathedrals have two towers, which, particularly in France, express an enormous diversity of form and decoration.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JH1/> In Germany and Eastern Europe there may be a single tall tower at the western end as at [[Freiburg M\u00fcnster]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, where the principle tower is usually over the crossing, the west front may be framed by large turrets,{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}   \n\nIn Italy, with the exception of [[Milan Cathedral]], the form of a Gothic west front is less strongly architectonic and sculptural than in other parts of Europe.

The position, construction and height of these towers  is as subject to variety as the nature of the west front, and was already well established by the beginning of the Gothic period. \n\nIn many parts of Europe, the location of twin towers on the west front of cathedrals was usual in the Romanesque period and may be seen at Abbaye les Hommes, Caen; [[Southwell Cathedral]], England; [[Lisbon Cathedral]], Portugal; [[Magdeburg Cathedral]], Germany; [[Cefalu Cathedral]], Sicily, and [[L\u00e9b\u00e9ny]] Abbey Church, Hungary.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Romanesque churches in the Rhineland often had many towers of different shapes, as did the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey Church of Cluny]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In mainland Italy, churches generally had one tower and that was freestanding from the building, sometimes at a distance, as at [[Pisa Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In Norman England, the crossing of large churches was often marked by a large tower, while abbey churches and cathedrals might have western towers as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Smaller churches, across Europe often had a single tower at the west.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The various configurations of church and tower of the Romanesque period continued into the Gothic, but with a greater emphasis on height. \n\nIn France, the plan for the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] called for two towers of equal height on the west front, and this plan was copied during the Gothic era at [Notre-Dame de Paris]], with towers of 69 meters (226&nbsp;ft) in height, and at other cathedrals of northern France such as Laon, Reims and Amiens.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=95\u201398}} Some of these churches were given towers over the crossing and transepts as well, with Rouen having three large towers, Laon having five, and the Romanesque Abbaey les Hommes, Caen, receiving additional towers during the Gothic period, until they numbered nine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  French Gothic towers are sometimes topped with spires.  [[Chartres Cathedral]]  has two on the western towers, of different dates and very different construction. That on the south is the tallest masonry spire of the 12th century, while that on the north is a highly elaborate Flamboyant design. The irregularity seen at Chartres also occurs at Rouen where there is a central tower in addition to the western towers. This tower displays another distinctly French feature, a delicate openwork [[fl\u00e8che]] made of wood covered with lead.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nOpenwork spires of stone, sometimes of great height, were popular in the Flamboyant period, occurring singly at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], Burgos Cathedral, Freiburg Cathedral, [[Stefansdom]], Vienna; and also at Cologne Cathedral and Ulm Minster, both designed in the Medieval period but not realised until the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn England, during the Gothic era, there was a continuing fashion for three towers, with the largest being that over the crossing. This arrangement is seen at Canterbury, Wells, Lincoln, York, Lichfield. and Durham Cathedrals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, wherever the ground was considered stable, the central tower was surmounted by a spire. Like the south spire of Chartres Cathedral, English spires are often constructed of masonry. The earliest is the comparatively small spire at Oxford Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The tallest Medieval masonry spire is that built in the 13th century at Salisbury Cathedral (123 m - 404 ft).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Others exist at Norwich and [[Chichester Cathedral]]s, while [[Lichfield Cathedral]] has three.  Other cathedrals had tall spires of wooden construction sheathed with lead or copper. Two of these, on the central towers of Lincoln Cathedral and [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] surpassed 550 feet in height and were the tallest structures prior to the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nEngland's Gothic parish churches and collegiate churches generally have a single western tower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} A number of the finest churches have masonry spires, with those of St James Church, Louth; St Wulfram's Church, Grantham; St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, and St Michael's, Coventry, all exceeding 85 metres (280 feet) in height.<ref>Julian Flannery, ''Fifty English Steeples: The Finest Medieval Parish Church Towers and Spires in England'', T&H, 2016, 10-0500343144</ref>  \n\nIn mainland [[Italy]], the tower, if present, is sometimes detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], or projects from the side of the building as at the Basilica of Santa Croce. In Italy there is no defined stylistic break between Romanesque and Gothic, as the architects had a seemingly pragmatic approach to the use of round and pointed arches. Towers of apparently Romanesque form often appear in conjunction with otherwise gothic structures. They tend to have graded series of openings in the Romanesque manner like the tower of the [[Badia Fiorentina]].  Some, like the tower at Santa Croce, have large openings of Gothic form and are surmounted by spires.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn addition to towers and spires, great Medieval churches, may have several other architectural forms, rising above the roofline, particularly over the crossing. These include the octagonal tower at Burgos Cathedral, the wooden octagonal tower at Ely Cathedral and the octagonal dome of Florence Cathedral, conceived in the late Gothic period and engineered by the Renaissance architect, Filippo Brunelleschi.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Towers and spires\n\n | image1    = Cathedrale laon facade 2012.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Laon Cathedral- the strongly articulated towers of the west front. \n\n | image2    = Facade cathedral.jpg\n | width2    = 150\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Chartres Cathedral- C12th masonry spire, and Flamboyant spire \n\n | image3    = Canterbury-15.jpg\n | width3    = 167\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Canterbury Cathedral - the large tower over the crossing \n\n | image4    = Rouen Cathedral as seen from Gros Horloge 140215 4.jpg\n | width4    = 140\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Rouen Cathedral- three different towers and a lead-covered fleche\n\n | image5    = Spire Cathedral St Stephen Vienna Wien Steffl 1.jpg\n | width5    = 137\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = St Stephan's Cathedral, Vienna- openwork stone spire \n\n | image6    = Lichfield Cathedral.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = Lichfield Cathedral- three masonry spires, the central being taller. \n\n | image7    = 26-Ely-004.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Ely Cathedral- the wooden octagon rises from an octagonal stone tower\n\n | image8    = Badia Fiorentina from Palazzo Vecchio n01.jpg\n | width8    = 150\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Badia Fiorentina, Florence- tall campanile with spire\n }}\n\n==Structural elements == \n\n===Pointed arch===\n[[File:Romanesque blind arcading at Christchurch Priory.jpg|thumb|Norman [[Blind arcade|blind-arcading]] at Christchurch Priory, Dorset.]]\nOne of the defining characteristics of Gothic architecture is the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed or ogival arch]].

This latter occurs at [[Durham Cathedral]] in the nave aisles in 1093.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance |title=Architectural Importance |publisher=Durham World Heritage Site |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>  Pointed arches also occur extensively in Romanesque decorative blind arcading, where semi-circular arches overlap each other in a simple decorative pattern, and the points are accidental to the design.\n\nIn Gothic architecture the pointed arch is used in every location where a vaulted shape is called for, both structural and decorative. Gothic openings such as doorways, windows, arcades and galleries have pointed arches. Gothic [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] above spaces both large and small is usually supported by richly moulded ribs. \n\nWhile structurally, use of the pointed arch gave a greater flexibility to architectural form, it also gave Gothic architecture a very different and more vertical visual character than Romanesque.  Rows of pointed arches upon delicate shafts form a typical wall decoration known as blind arcading. Niches with pointed arches and containing statuary are a major external feature of Gothic cathedrals. The pointed arch lent itself to elaborate intersecting shapes which developed within window spaces into complex Gothic tracery forming the structural support of the large windows that are characteristic of the style.<ref name=CT/><ref name=NP/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Pointed arches\n | image1    = North_Bay_Peterborough_Cathedral.JPG\n | width1    = 171\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = One of three large arches that screen the front of Peterborough Cathedral. \n | image2    = Catedral de Salisbury, Salisbury, Inglaterra, 2014-08-12, DD 35-37 HDR.JPG\n | width2    = 124\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The North transept of Salisbury Cathedral has grouped lancet openings \n | image3    =  Lincoln, Cathedral 20060726 015.jpg \n | width3    = 168\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = LIncoln Cathedral has arades, galleries, clerestory, vault, and blind arcades of pointed arches\n | image4    = Florencia - Firenze - Basilica de Santa Maria Novella - Interior - 01.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = At Santa Maria Novella, the wedge-shaped voussoirs that support the pointed vault are emphasised by colour.  \n | image5    = Wells-Cathedral 9762.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = The eastern end of Wells Cathedral evolved in three stages to form a harmonious vista of pointed arches. \n | image6    = Reims Cathedral, exterior (4).jpg\n | width6    = 168\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The west front of Reims Cathedral shows the pointed arches of portals and galleries combined with gables and rose window. \n | image7    = Cathedrale-de-Strasbourg-IMG 4235.jpg\n | width7    = 150\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = A detail of the windows and galleries of the west front of Strasbourg Cahedral \n }}\n\n\n===Ribbed vault=== \n\nThe Gothic [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] of pointed arches, unlike the semi-circular vault of Roman and Romanesque buildings, can be used to roof rectangular and irregularly shaped plans such as [[trapezoids]]. The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle. This enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture.<ref name=BF/>\n\nIn Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the [[barrel vault]]s that covered the nave pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. Gothic architects found a solution through an innovative use of the rib vault.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\nAn early kind of rib vault, used at [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]] (8th century), was found under a [[cupola]] or [[dome]], but was different in form and function from the later Gothic rib vault. The cupola itself was supported by [[pendentive]]s or [[squinch]]es, a practice used in [[Byzantine architecture]]. The ribs were decorative. The vaults in churches in [[Sicily]] dated to the 11th century, after Sicily had been conquered by the Normans, and resembled the vaults used at the same time in Normandy and England.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nGothic builders designed a new and lighter kind of rib vault. They divided into compartments by a diagonal crossing of thin stone ribs (''ogives''), and completed by two additional arcs perpendicular and parallel to the nave (''doubleaux'' and ''formerets''). They also made innovative use of the broken arch or pointed arch. In Islamic and Romanesque architecture, pointed arches had usually been used in doorways and windows. Gothic architects used them at the meeting points of the ribs at the top of the vaults, which distributed the weight of the roof downwards and outwards, not just downwards.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}} These ribs divided the early vaults into six compartments, each as wide as two traverses of the nave. Some of the ribs went downwards as [[colonette]]s and were bundled into pillars on the ground floor. Other ribs carried the thrust outwards to the walls, where it was counterbalanced by heavy flying buttresses outside the walls. Since the weight was supported by pillars and buttresses, the walls themselves could be much higher and thinner. This made possible the expanses of [[stained glass]] that were a characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic rib vaults, used at Notre-Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, were very difficult to build, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was simplified, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vaults also made it possible to build the cathedrals even higher. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1163 with four-part vaults, reached a height of 35 meters, remarkable for the time. [[Amiens Cathedral]], begun in 1220 with four-part ribs, reached the height of 42.30 meters (138.8 feet) at the transept.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=18-28}}\n\nIn the later period of the Gothic style, from the early 14th century, the rib vaults lost their elegant simplicity and were loaded with additional ribs, sculptural designs, and sometimes pendants and other purely decorative elements.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Ribbed vaults\n | image1    = B\u00f3veda de catedral de Notre Dame de Par\u00eds 3.jpg\n | width1    = 144\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame, Paris- square, sexpartite vaults spanning two nave bays\n | image2    = Salisbury Cathedral Interior 01.jpg\n | width2    = 162\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Salisbury Cathedral, England- rectangular quadripartite vault over single bay\n | image3    = Lincoln cathedral 13 Nave vault.jpg\n | width3    = 162\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Lincoln Cathedral, England- quadripartite form, with tierceron ribs and ridge rib with carved bosses. \n | image4    = \n | width4    = 155\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  =   \n | image5    = Bremer Dom Juli 2009 PD 060.JPG\n | width5    = 144\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Bremer Cathedral, Germany- north aisle, a reticular (net) vault with intersecting ribs. \n | image6    = Wolfsberg Sankt Marein Pfarrkirche Mariae Himmelfahrt Netzrippengewoelbe 03092014 742.jpg\n | width6    = 144\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = St Marien's, Wolfsberg, Austria- stellar vault with intersecting lierne ribs.  \n | image7    = B\u00f3vedas catedral Salamanca 40.jpg\n | width7    = 162\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Salamanca Cathedral, Spain- vault has Flamboyant S-shaped and circular lierne ribs, \n | image8    = Peterborough Retrochoir fan vaulting.JPG\n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Peterborough Cathedral retrochoir- fan vaulting, which further evolved into pemdant vaulting. \n }}\n\n===Buttresses===\nAnother important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses. The earliest Gothic cathedrals, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses. Their walls were supported by heavy stone [[abutment]]s placed directly against the walls. The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.\n\nIn the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]]. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rainwater off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone [[gargoyles]] placed in rows on the buttresses.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=50\u201351}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Buttresses\n | image1    = Strebewerk-2.jpg\n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Section of Reims Cathedral with flying buttress over single aisles. \n | image2    =Lincoln, UK - panoramio (30).jpg\n | width2    = 247\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =  East end of Lincoln Cathedral, with wall buttress, and chapter house with flying buttresses. \n | image3    = Canterbury Cathedral 04.JPG\n | width3    = 245\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Wall buttresses and simple flying buttresses behind a parapet at Canterbury Cathedral\n | image4    = Amiens Cath\u00e9drale Notre-dame arc-boutant sud-est 4.jpg\n | width4    = 247\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The complex buttresses of Amiens Cathedral support one of the highest Gothic vaults \n | image5    = Arri\u00e8re de la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris en mars 2014.jpg\n | width5    = 274\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  The east end of Notre Dame de Pariswith flying buttresses supporting the high vault\n }}\n\n==Architectural character==\n\n===Height===\nA characteristic of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and in proportion to its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. A section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/>\n\nExternally, [[tower]]s and [[spire]]s are characteristic of Gothic churches both great and small, the number and positioning being one of the greatest variables in Gothic architecture. In Italy, the tower, if present, is almost always detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], and is often from an earlier structure. In France and Spain, two towers on the front is the norm. In England, Germany and Scandinavia this is often the arrangement, but an English cathedral may also be surmounted by an enormous tower at the crossing. Smaller churches usually have just one tower, but this may also be the case at larger buildings, such as [[Salisbury Cathedral]] or [[Ulm Minster]], which has the tallest spire in the world,<ref name=\"Ref_g\">The open-work spire was completed in 1890 to the original design.</ref> slightly exceeding that of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the tallest which was actually completed during the medieval period, at {{convert|160|m|ft}}.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center \n | perrow    = 6\n | header    = Height\n\n| image1    = \u00c9glise Sainte-Marie de L\u00fcbeck.jpg\n | width1   = 175\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The tallest wood and copper spires, in the world, Lubeck Cathedral, Germany. <small>rebuilt post WWII</small>\n\n | image2    = Lincoln Cathedral, Central Tower.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Lincoln Cathedral- the large central tower, carried the tallest spire in the world \n\n | image3    =  Salisbury Cathedral from West.JPG\n | width3    = 146\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = The tallest spire of the C13th century, and tallest masonry spire ever built, at Salisbury Cathedral. \n\n | image4    = Cathedrale Strasbourg vue generale.jpg\n | width4    = 146\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The openwork spire of Strasbourg Cathedral, the tallest stone spire of the  Gothic era.  \n\n | image5    = Westturm und Hahnent\u00fcrme des Freiburger M\u00fcnsters vom Schlossberg 2.jpg\n | width5    = 164\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = The tallest remaining medieval spire in Germany, at Freiburg Minster \n\n | image6    = Cupola di santa maria del fiore dal campanile di giotto, 02.JPG\n | width6    = 165\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The dome of Florence Cathedral, designed c. 1370, engineered by [[Brunelleschi]], C15th  \n\n | image7    =  London UK Interior-of-Westminster-Abbey-02.jpg \n | width7    = 152\n | alt7      = Photo by CEphoto, Uwe Aranas\n | caption7  =  Westminster Abbey, nave- 31 m (102 ft)\n\n | image8    = 0 Amiens - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (4).JPG\n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  =  The choir of Amiens Cathedral, 42.3 m (139 ft)\n\n | image9   = CologneCathedralAltar.jpg\n | width9    = 160\n | alt9      =\n | caption9  = Cologne Cathedral, choir 43.35 m (142.2 ft)\n\n | image10   = Palma LaSeu interior crop.jpg\n | width10    = 155\n | alt10      =\n | caption10  = Le Seu,Palma, Mallorca, nave, 44 m (144 ft)\n\n | image11    = Florenca122.jpg\n | width11    = 174\n | alt11      =\n | caption11  = The nave of Florence Cathedral, 45 m (148 ft)   \n\n | image12    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais, choeur.jpg\n | width12    = 158\n | alt12      =\n | caption12  = The choir of Beauvais Cathedral, 47.5 m (156 ft) \n  }}\n\n\n<!---===Height===\nAn important characteristic of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and in proportion to its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nBeauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century, the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nA section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England, the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at Beauvais Cathedral at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/> --->\n\n====Vertical emphasis====\nThe pointed arch lends itself to a suggestion of height. This appearance is characteristically further enhanced by both the architectural features and the decoration of the building.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\nOn the exterior, the verticality is emphasised in a major way by the towers and spires and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by narrow half-columns called ''attached shafts'' which often pass through several storeys of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated. The roofline, gable ends, buttresses and other parts of the building are often terminated by small pinnacles, [[Milan Cathedral]] being an extreme example in the use of this form of decoration.\n\nOn the interior of the building attached shafts often sweep unbroken from floor to ceiling and meet the ribs of the vault, like a tall tree spreading into branches. The verticals are generally repeated in the treatment of the windows and wall surfaces. In many Gothic churches, particularly in France, and in the ''Perpendicular period'' of [[English Gothic architecture]], the treatment of vertical elements in gallery and window tracery creates a strongly unifying feature that counteracts the horizontal divisions of the interior structure.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = \n | image1    = Reims - 2013-08-27 - IMG 2265.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = West front of Reims Cathedral \n\n | image2    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais ext 106.JPG\n | width2    = 167\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The exterior of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral \n\n | image3    = Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg\n | width3    = 150\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Figures around the central door of Chartres Cathedral \n | image4    = The Five Sisters - geograph.org.uk - 770345.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The Five Sister windows in the north transept at York Minster\n | image5    = PM 103594 F Bourges.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  A clustered column of the nave at Bourges Cathedral  \n | image6    = Koelner dom nordseite des chors.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = Vertical elements in the galleries at Cologne Cathedral \n | image7    =Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = The buttresses pinnacles of the choir at Cologne Cathedral \n\n }}\n\n===Light===\nExpansive interior light has been a feature of Gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened. The metaphysics of light in the Middle Ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings. Much of this belief was based on the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a sixth-century mystic whose book, [[The Celestial Hierarchy]], was popular among monks in France. Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine. To promote such faith, the abbot in charge of the Saint-Denis church on the north edge of Paris, the [[Abbot Suger]], encouraged architects remodelling the building to make the interior as bright as possible.\n\nEver since the remodelled [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] opened in 1144, Gothic architecture has featured expansive windows, such as at [[Sainte Chapelle]], [[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The increase in size between windows of the Romanesque and Gothic periods is related to the use of the ribbed vault, and in particular, the pointed ribbed vault which channelled the weight to a supporting shaft with less outward thrust than a semi-circular vault. Walls did not need to be so weighty.<ref name=NP/><ref name=Swaan/>\n\nA further development was the flying buttress which arched externally from the springing of the vault across the roof of the aisle to a large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line of the external wall. These piers were often surmounted by a [[pinnacle]] or [[statue]], further adding to the downward weight, and counteracting the outward thrust of the vault and buttress arch as well as stress from wind loading.\n\nThe internal columns of the arcade with their attached shafts, the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses, with their associated vertical buttresses jutting at right-angles to the building, created a stone skeleton. Between these parts, the walls and the infill of the vaults could be of lighter construction. Between the narrow buttresses, the walls could be opened up into large windows.<ref name=BF/>\n\nThrough the Gothic period, thanks to the versatility of the pointed arch, the structure of Gothic windows developed from simple openings to immensely rich and decorative sculptural designs. The windows were very often filled with [[stained glass]] which added a dimension of colour to the light within the building, as well as providing a medium for figurative and narrative art.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Light\n | image1    =  Flying buttresses of Notre-Dame de Strasbourg.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Large clerestory windows between flying buttresses at Strasbourg\n | image2    = Lyon 5 - Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean 03.jpg\n | width2    = 185\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall windows lighting the vault at [[Lyon Cathedral]], made possible by flying buttresses\n | image3    = Chapter House, Wells Cathedral 9 (9317650737).jpg\n | width3    = 185\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Windows in a polygonal arrangement, Lady Chapel, Wells Cathedral\n | image4    = Rouen (24748511178).jpg \n | width4    = 185\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Tall windows in the aisle at Rouen, with additional windows in the triforium   \n | image5    = York Minster, York (14047415195).jpg\n | width5    = 185\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = \"Heart of Yorkshire\" window at York Minster, the scale of most west windows in England. \n | image6    = Paris 2019 (31878003887).jpg\n | width6    = 185\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The array of glass between thin stone mullions, [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris\n }}\n\n===Evolving styles===\nThe way in which the pointed arch was drafted and utilised developed throughout the Gothic period. There were fairly clear stages of development, which did not, however, progress at the same rate, or in the same way in every country. Moreover, the names used to define various periods or styles within Gothic architecture differs from country to country.\n\n====Lancet arch====\n\nSee also [[Lancet window]]. The simplest shape is the long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. Lancet openings are often grouped, usually as a cluster of three or five. Lancet openings may be very narrow and steeply pointed. Lancet arches are typically defined as two-centred arches whose radii are larger than the arch's span.<ref name=ching1>{{cite book|last=Ching|first=Francis D.K.|title=A Visual Dictionary of Architecture|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-64885-8|edition=2nd|page=6}}</ref>\n\n[[Salisbury Cathedral]] is famous for the beauty and simplicity of its Lancet Gothic, known in England as the Early English Style. [[York Minster]] has a group of lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient glass. They are known as the Five Sisters. These simple undecorated grouped windows are found at Chartres and [[Laon Cathedral]]s and are used extensively in [[Gothic architecture in Italy|Italy]].<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\n[[File:YorkMinsterChapterHouse.jpg|thumb|left|Windows in the Chapter House at [[York Minster]] show the equilateral arch with typical circular motifs in the tracery.]]\n\n====Equilateral arch====\n[[File:Equlateral arch.PNG|thumb|right|Equilateral Arch]]\nMany Gothic openings are based upon the [[Equilateral triangle|equilateral]] form. In other words, when the arch is drafted, the [[radius]] is exactly the width of the opening and the centre of each arch coincides with the point from which the opposite arch springs. This makes the arch higher in relation to its width than a semi-circular arch which is exactly half as high as it is wide.<ref name=BF/>\n\nThe Equilateral Arch gives a wide opening of satisfying proportion useful for doorways, decorative arcades and large windows.\n\nThe structural beauty of the Gothic arch means, however, that no set proportion had to be rigidly maintained. The Equilateral Arch was employed as a useful tool, not as a principle of design. This meant that narrower or wider arches were introduced into a building plan wherever necessity dictated. In the architecture of some Italian cities, notably [[Venice]], semi-circular arches are interspersed with pointed ones.<ref name=\"Ref_h\">This does not happen in French or English Gothic and so to the British or French eye, to be a strange disregard for style.</ref>\n\nThe Equilateral Arch lends itself to filling with tracery of simple equilateral, circular and semi-circular forms. The type of tracery that evolved to fill these spaces is known in England as Geometric Decorated Gothic and can be seen to splendid effect at many English and French Cathedrals, notably Lincoln and Notre Dame in Paris. Windows of complex design and of three or more ''lights'' or vertical sections, are often designed by overlapping two or more equilateral arches.<ref name=CT/>\n\n====Flamboyant arch====\n[[File:Limoges curvilinear tracery.JPG|thumb|[[Flamboyant]] tracery at [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges Cathedral]].]]\nThe [[Flamboyant]] Arch is one that is drafted from four points, the upper part of each main arc turning upwards into a smaller arc and meeting at a sharp, flame-like point. These arches create a rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface decoration. The form is structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within a larger and more stable arch. It is not employed at all for [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]].<ref name=BF/>\n\nSome of the most beautiful and famous traceried windows of Europe employ this type of tracery. It can be seen at [[St Stephen's Vienna]], [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, at the Cathedrals of [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges]] and [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]] in France. In England the most famous examples are the West Window of [[York Minster]] with its design based on the [[Sacred Heart]], the extraordinarily rich nine-light East Window at [[Carlisle Cathedral]] and the exquisite East window of [[Selby Abbey]].<ref name=CT/><ref name=NP/>\n\nDoorways surmounted by Flamboyant mouldings are very common in both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture in France. They are much rarer in England. A notable example is the doorway to the Chapter Room at [[Rochester Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\nThe style was much used in England for wall arcading and niches. Prime examples in are in the Lady Chapel at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], the Screen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and externally on the fa\u00e7ade of [[Exeter Cathedral]]. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture it often appears as openwork screens on the exterior of buildings. The style was used to rich and sometimes extraordinary effect in both these countries, notably on the famous pulpit in [[Vienna Cathedral]].<ref name=JH1/>\n\n[[File:F\u00e4chergew\u00f6lbe KingsCollege.jpg|thumb|left|The depressed arch supported by fan [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] at [[King's College Chapel]], England.]]\n\n====Depressed arch====\nThe depressed or [[four-centred arch]] is much wider than its height and gives the visual effect of having been flattened under pressure. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small [[radius]] and then turn into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point.<ref name=BF/>\n\nThis type of arch, when employed as a window opening, lends itself to very wide spaces, provided it is adequately supported by many narrow vertical shafts. These are often further braced by horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface.\n\nThe style, known as [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]], that evolved from this treatment is specific to England, although very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular, and was employed to great effect through the 15th century and first half of the 16th as Renaissance styles were much slower to arrive in England than in Italy and France.<ref name=BF/>\n\nIt can be seen notably at the East End of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] where the East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court. There are three very famous royal chapels and one chapel-like Abbey which show the style at its most elaborate: [[King's College Chapel]], [[Cambridge]]; [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]]; [[Henry VII's Chapel]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[Bath Abbey]].<ref name=CT/> However very many simpler buildings, especially churches built during the wool boom in [[East Anglia]], are fine examples of the style.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = \n | image1    = \n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = \n | image2    = \n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = \n | image3    = \n | width3    = 160\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = \n | image4    = \n | width4    = 160\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  =   \n | image5    = \n | width5    = 160\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = \n | image6    = \n | width6    = 160\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = \n | image7    = \n | width7    = 160\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = \n | image8    = \n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  =  \n }}\n\n\n<!---\n\n==Elements of Gothic style==\n===Plan===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Plan.cathedrale.Chartres.png|Plan of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1194\u20131220)\nFile:YorkMinsterPlanDehio vert.jpg|Plan of [[York Minster]]\nFile:Cathedral schematic plan en vectorial.svg|Plan of a Gothic Cathedral\nFile:Plan.cathedrale.Cologne.png|Plan of [[Cologne Cathedral]]\nFile:Coupe.nef.eglise.Saint.Denis.png|Cross section of the nave wall and buttresses of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]\n</gallery>\n\nThe plan of the Gothic cathedral was based on the model of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was a combined public market and courthouse; which was also the basis of the plan of the Romanesque cathedral. The cathedral is in the form of a [[Latin cross]]. The entrance is traditionally on the west end, has three portals decorated with sculpture, usually a rose window, and is flanked by two towers. The long nave, where the congregation worshipped, occupies the west end. This is usually divided from the nave by rows of pillars, which support the roof, flanked by one or two [[aisle]]s, called ''[[:fr:Collat\u00e9ral (architecture)|collat\u00e9raux]]''. There are usually small chapels on the two sides, placed between the buttresses, which provide additional support to the walls.\n\nThe cathedral usually has a [[transept]], a crossing, roughly in the middle, which sometimes projects outwards some distance, and in other cases, such as Notre-Dame, is minimal. The ''crois\u00e9e'' or crossing of the transept, is the centre of the church, and is surrounded by particularly massive pillars, which sometimes support a [[lantern tower]], which brings light into the centre of the cathedral. The north and south facades of the transept often feature rose windows, as at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].\n\nTo the east of the transept is the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], where the altar is located, where ceremonies take place, and where only the clergy is allowed. This space grew greatly in the 12th century, as ceremonies became more elaborate. Behind the choir is a single or double walkway called ambulatory. At the eastern end of the church is the [[apse]], usually in the form of a half-circle, and the chevet. There is usually a chapel here dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which can be very large. Around the chevet there are usually several other smaller chapels.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic cathedrals had four levels, from the floor to the roof. On the ground floor, there were two rows grand arcades with large pillars, which received the weight of the vaults of the ceiling. Above these were the tribunes, a section of arched openings, giving more support. Above these was the [[triforium]], a section of small arches. On the top level, just below the vaults, were the upper windows, the main source of light for the cathedral. The lower walls were supported by massive ''contreforts'' or buttresses placed directly up against them, with pinnacles on top which provided additional weight. Later, with the development of the flying buttress, the supports moved further away from the walls, and the walls were built much higher. Gradually, the tribunes and the triforium disappeared, and the walls above the arcades were occupied almost entirely with stained glass.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=33}}\n\nThe eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In England it is generally long and may have two distinct sections, both choir and [[Chancel|presbytery]]. It is often square ended or has a projecting [[Lady chapel]] dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]]. In France, the eastern end is often polygonal and surrounded by a walkway called an ambulatory and sometimes a ring of chapels called a [[chevet]]. While German churches are often similar to those of France, in Italy, the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually just a shallow [[Apse chapel|apsidal chapel]] containing the sanctuary, as at [[Florence Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/><ref name=Swaan>Wim Swaan, ''The Gothic Cathedral''</ref>    --->\n\n===Stained glass windows===\n{{see also|Gothic tracery}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitraux Saint-Denis 190110 19.jpg|[[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], Abbot [[Suger]] represented at feet of Virgin Mary (12th century)\nFile:Chartres_RosetteSued_122_DSC08269.jpg|South transept rose window of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1221\u20131230)\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Bourges - D\u00e9tail du vitrail de l'Apocalypse (d\u00e9but XIII\u00e8me si\u00e8cle).JPG|Detail of the Apocalypse window, [[Bourges Cathedral]], early 13th century\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral, south Oculus (37582928966).jpg|South [[Oculus]] of [[Canterbury Cathedral]].

Historians including [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}\n\nReligious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine. When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], he instructed that the windows in the choir admit as much light as possible.\n\nMany earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref name=Swaan/>\n\nThe main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of coloured glass were joined together with pieces of lead, and then their surfaces were painted with faces and other details. and then the windows were mounted in the stone frames. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass.\n\nThe stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the [[Bible]], but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\nMuch of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\n===Portals and the tympanum===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Saint Denis PM 086190 F.jpg|North portal of [[Basilica of St Denis]], with early [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] and columns made of elongated figures (1135\u20131140)\nFile:Amiens cathedral Tympanumt.JPG|Day of Judgement [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] at [[Amiens Cathedral]] (1220\u20131270), the prototype for other high Gothic portals.\nFile:Frontispice cath\u00e9drale Strasbourg.JPG|Portals and tympanum of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] (Begun 1176)\nFile:WestminsterNorth55.jpg|[[Westminster Abbey]] north portal (begun 1245)\n</gallery>\n\nEarly Gothic Cathedrals traditionally have their main entrance at the western end of the church, opposite the choir. Based on the model of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], there are usually three doorways with pointed arches, richly filled with sculpture. The [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], or arch, over each doorway is filled with realistic statues illustrating biblical stories, and the columns between the doors are often also crowded with statuary. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe iconography of the sculptural decoration on the facade was not left to the artists. An edict of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 had set the rules: \"The composition of religious images is not to be left to the inspiration of artists; it is derived from the principles put in place by the Catholic Church and religious tradition. Only the art belongs to the artist; the composition belongs to the Fathers.\"{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=79}}\n\nThe portals and interiors were much more colourful than they are today. Each sculpture on the tympanum and in the interior was painted by the ''peintre imagier'', or image painter, following a system of colours codified in the 12th century; yellow, called ''gold'', symbolized intelligence, grandeur and virtue; white, called ''argent'', symbolized purity, wisdom, and correctness; black, or ''sable'', meant sadness, but also will; green, or ''sinople'', represented hope, liberty and joy; red or ''gueules'' (see [[gules]]) meant charity or victory; blue or ''azure'' symbolized the sky, faithfulness and perseverance; and violet, or ''pourpre'', was the colour of royalty and sovereignty.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=54}}\n\n===Sculpture and decoration===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chartres2006 076.jpg|Statues of Saints are literally \"pillars of the church\", supporting the portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]].\nFile:Paris - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame - Portail de la Vierge - PA00086250 - 003.jpg|The martyr Saint [[Denis]], holding his head, over the Portal of the Virgin ([[Notre-Dame de Paris]])\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris - Portail du Jugement dernier - d\u00e9tail 01.jpg|The serpent tempts Adam and Eve; part of the [[Last Judgement]] on the central portal of west facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:DevilCentralGateNotreDameParis.jpg|[[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] and Satan weighing souls during the [[Last Judgement]] ([[Notre-Dame de Paris]] central portal, west facade)\nFile:Chimera of Notre-Dame de Paris, 26 April 2014.jpg|A [[strix (mythology)|stryge]] on west facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Notre-Dame Rzygacze.JPG|[[Gargoyles]] were the rainspouts of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Gargoyle Point of View (3575829233).jpg|[[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] on [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] west facade\nFile:H\u00f4tel de ville de Bruxelles - Gargouille 01.JPG|[[Gargoyle]] on [[Brussels Town Hall]]\nFile:Gargoyles and Saints - Siena Cathedral.jpg|Gargoyle on [[Siena Cathedral]] (13th century)\nFile:Labyrinthchartres.jpg|[[Labyrinth]] at [[Chartres Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\n\nThe exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read. They were described as \"Books for the poor.\" To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the facades was originally painted and gilded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e9ne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture Fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6. (Project Gutenburg).</ref>\n\nEach feature of the Cathedral had a symbolic meaning. The main portals at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[Last Judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as \"the pillars of the church.\"{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}} Each Saint had his own symbol: a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]], an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpets, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate their function at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the [[Garden of Eden]]; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}}\n\nThe [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The strix appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.<ref name=fasti>Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131\u2013,{{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.</ref> They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshippers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nThe [[gargoyle]]s, which were added to Notre-Dame in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]]. They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]] during the 19th-century restoration. Similar figures appear on the other Gothic cathedrals of France.\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n==French Gothic==\n{{Main|French Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFranceNormandieCoutancesCathNotreDameFacade.jpg|[[Coutances Cathedral]] in Normandy (1210\u20131274)\nP1240007 Bayeux cathedrale ND rwk.jpg|[[Bayeux Cathedral]] in Normandy (1180\u20131350)\nNef de la cath\u00e9drale d'Auxerre.jpg|Interior of [[Auxerre Cathedral]] in Burgundy (1215\u20131233)\nAlbi Sainte-C\u00e9cile.JPG|[[Albi Cathedral]], originally begun as a fortress, in Southwest France (1282\u20131480)\nNave of the Ste C\u00e9cile Cathedral - 2014-02-22.jpg|Polychrome interior of [[Albi Cathedral]] (1282\u20131480)\nFile:Fa\u00e7ade de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Toulouse.jpg|[[Toulouse Cathedral]] (13th century)\nPalmier des Jacobins.JPG|The Palm Tree of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]], 28 meters high ([[Toulouse]], 1292)\n</gallery>\n\nFrom the 12th century onwards, the Gothic style spread from Northern France to other regions of France and gradually to the rest of the Europe. It was often carried by the highly skilled craftsmen who had trained in the Ile-de-France and then carried their crafts to other cities. The style was adapted to local styles and materials.\n\nIn [[Normandy]], the new naves were usually very long, sometimes more than one hundred meters, and, from the long Romanesque tradition, the walls were thicker than in northern France, and had shorter buttresses. The interiors were narrower than in the north, and were given a strong sense of verticality by long and narrow bays and lancet arches. Rose windows were rare, replaced on the exterior by a large bay in ''tiers point''. The facades had less sculptural decoration; decoration in the interior was largely in geometric forms. Norman Gothic also usually featured a profusion of towers, lanterns and [[spire]]s; spires and [[Fl\u00e8che|spirelets]] sometimes were seventy meters high. [[Bayeux Cathedral]], [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Coutances Cathedral]] are notable examples of Norman Gothic.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n\nIn [[Burgundy]], which had a long [[Romanesque style]] tradition, a [[lantern tower]] was often included, and cathedrals often had a narrow passage the length of the cathedral at the level of the stained glass windows. as in [[Auxerre Cathedral]].\n\nIn the Southwest of France, the walls were thicker, with narrow openings, and doubled with arches. The flying buttress was rarely used, replaced by heavy [[abutment]]s with chapels between.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n\nThe south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. The Gothic cathedrals were often built with brick and tile rather than stone. They generally had thick walls and narrow windows, and were braced by heavy abutments rather than flying buttresses. The form of the tower of [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|the basilica of Saint-Sernin]] was copied by several cathedrals in the south, while the old nave of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] (1210\u20131220) gave the model of the single nave which was generally used in Southern French Gothic architecture (although some churches had two or three naves of equal height). Some Gothic cathedrals in the [[Southern France|Midi]] took unusual form; the [[Cathedral of Albi]] (1282\u20131480) was originally built as fortress, then converted to a cathedral. Albi Cathedral has another very distinctive feature; a colourful interior and painted ceiling.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}} In the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]] of [[Toulouse]], the grafting of a single apse of polygonal plan on a church with two vessels gave birth to a starry vault whose complex organization anticipated more than a century on the Flamboyant Gothic. Tradition refers to this masterpiece as \"palm tree\", because the veins gush out of the smooth shaft of the column-like palm trees.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1337/ | title=Episcopal City of Albi}}</ref>\n\nThe facade of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] is unusual; it is the combination of two unfinished cathedral buildings, begun in the 13th century and finally put together. Toulouse Cathedral has no flying buttresses; it is supported by massive ''contreforts'' the height of the building, with chapels between.\n\n==English Gothic==\n{{Main|English Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir 2, Kent, UK - Diliff.jpg|12th century choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] ([[Early English Gothic]])\nFile:Salisbury Cathedral Choir, Wiltshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|Choir of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220\u20131258) ([[Early English Gothic]])\nFile:YorkMinsterWest.jpg|West front of [[York Minster]] ([[Decorated Gothic]])\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|[[Gloucester Cathedral]] ([[Perpendicular Gothic]]) (1351\u20131377)\nFile:Westminster abbey16.jpg|Fan vaults with pendants at the [[Henry VII Chapel]] of [[Westminster Abbey]] ([[Perpendicular Gothic]]) (1503)\n</gallery>\n\nThe Gothic style was imported very early into England, in part due to the close connection with the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which until 1204 was still ruled by the Kings of England. The first period is generally called [[early English Gothic]], and was dominant from about 1180 to 1275. The first part of major English cathedral to feature the new style was the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], begun about 1175. It was created by a French master builder, [[William of Sens]]. He added several original touches, including coloured marble pavement, double columns in the arcades, and engaged slender ''colonettes'' which reached up to the vaults, borrowed from the design of [[Laon Cathedral]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=34\u201335}} [[Westminster Abbey]] was rebuilt from 1245 to 1517. [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220\u20131320) is also a good example of early Gothic, with the exception of its tower and spire, which were added in 1320.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe second period of English Gothic is known as [[Decorated Gothic]]. It is customarily divided into two the \"Geometric\" style (1250\u201390) and the \"Curvilinear\" style (1290\u20131350), and it is similar to the French [[Rayonnant]] style, with an emphasis on curvilinear forms, particularly in the windows. This period saw detailed stone carving reach its peak, with elaborately carved windows and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], often with floral patterns, or with an accolade, a carved arch over a window decorated with pinnacles and a [[fleuron (architecture)|fleuron]], or carved floral element.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe rib vaults of the Decorated Gothic became extremely ornate, with a profusion of ribs that were purely ornamental. The vaults were often decorated with hanging stone pendants. The columns also became more ornamental, as at Peterborough Cathedral, with ribs spreading upward.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380\u20131520) was the final phase of English Gothic, lasting into the 16th century. As the name suggests, its emphasis was on clear horizontal and vertical lines, meeting at right angles. Columns extended upwards all the way to the roof, giving the interior the appearance of a cage of glass and stone, as in the nave of [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The [[Tudor Arch|Tudor arch]] appeared, wider and lower and often framed by [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]], which was used to create larger windows and to balance the strong vertical elements. The design of the rib vaults became even more complex, including the [[fan vault]] with pendants used in the Henry VII chapel at [[Westminster Abbey]] (1503\u201307).{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\nA distinctive characteristic of English cathedrals is their extreme length, and their internal emphasis upon the horizontal, which may be emphasised visually as much or more than the vertical lines. Each English cathedral (with the exception of Salisbury) has an extraordinary degree of stylistic diversity, when compared with most French, German and Italian cathedrals. It is not unusual for every part of the building to have been built in a different century and in a different style, with no attempt at creating a stylistic unity. Unlike French cathedrals, English cathedrals sprawl across their sites, with double transepts projecting strongly and [[Lady chapel]]s tacked on at a later date, such as at Westminster Abbey. In the west front, the doors are not as significant as in France, the usual congregational entrance being through a side porch. The West window is very large and never a rose, which are reserved for the transept gables. The west front may have two towers like a French cathedral, or none. There is nearly always a tower at the crossing and it may be very large and surmounted by a spire. The distinctive English east end is square, but it may take a completely different form. Both internally and externally, the stonework is often richly decorated with carvings, particularly the capitals.<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\n==Northern European Gothic==\n{{See also|Architecture of Germany|Brabantine Gothic|Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic architecture in Lithuania|Polish Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Kdom.jpg|Rear of [[Cologne Cathedral]], [[Cologne]], [[Germany]] (1248\u20131473)\nFile:Matthias Church Budapest Corrected.jpg|[[Matthias Church]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (11th\u201315th centuries)\nFile:Saint Wenceslas Chapel, St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague 20160809 1.jpg|St. Wenceslas Chapel in [[St. Vitus Cathedral|Prague Cathedral]], [[Czech Republic]] (1356\u20131367)\nFile:Wien - Stephansdom (1).JPG|[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]], [[Austria]] (1339\u20131365)\nFile:20110917 Krakow Kosciol Mariacki 0306.jpg|[[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]] (1290\u20131365)\nFile:Haarlem bavo inside.jpg|[[Brabantine Gothic]] [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem]] in [[Netherlands]] (c. 1479)\n</gallery>\n\nBetween the 13th and 16th centuries, Gothic cathedrals were constructed in most of the major cities of northern Europe. For the most part, they followed the French model, but with variations depending upon local traditions and the materials available. The first Gothic churches in Germany were built from about 1230. They included [[Liebfrauenkirche, Trier|Liebfrauenkirche]] ( ca. 1233\u20131283) in [[Trier]], claimed to be the oldest Gothic church in Germany,<ref>{{Cite web|author=UNESCO|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/367|title=UNESCO Cultural Heritage Sites; Liebfrukirche, Trier}}</ref> and [[Freiburg Cathedral]], which was built in three stages, the first beginning in 1120, though only the foundations of the original cathedral still exist. It is noted for its 116-metre tower, the only Gothic church tower in Germany that was completed in the Middle Ages (1330).\n\n[[Prague]], in the region of [[Bohemia]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was another flourishing centre for Gothic architecture. [[Charles IV of Bohemia]] was both King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, and he had monumental tastes. He began construction of Prague's [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in the Gothic style in 1344, as well as a Gothic palace, [[Karl\u0161tejn|Karlstein Castle]] in Central Bohemia, and Gothic buildings for the new [[Charles University|University of Prague]]. The nave of [[Prague Cathedral]] featured the filet vault, a decorative type of vault in which the ribs criss-crossed in a mesh pattern, similar to the vaults of [[Bristol Cathedral]] and other English churches. His other Gothic projects included the lavishly decorated Chapel of the Holy Cross inside [[Karl\u0161tejn|Karlstein Castle]] (1357\u20131367), and the choir of [[Aachen Cathedral]] begun in 1355, which was built on the model of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=221\u2013230}} Gothic architecture in Germany and the kingdoms of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] generally followed the French formula, but the towers were much taller and, if completed, were often surmounted by enormous openwork spires. The distinctive character of the interior of German Gothic cathedrals is their breadth and openness. German and Czech cathedrals, like the French, tend not to have strongly projecting transepts. There are also many [[hall church]]es (''Hallenkirchen'') without [[clerestory]] windows.<ref name=BF/><ref name=Swaan /> [[Cologne Cathedral]] is after [[Milan Cathedral]] the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. Construction began in 1248 and took, with interruptions, until 1880 to complete&nbsp;\u2013 a period of over 600 years.

Another regional variation is the [[Brabantine Gothic]] a style found in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is characterized by using light-coloured [[sandstone]] or limestone, which allowed rich detailing but was prone to erosion. Features included columns with sculpted cabbage-like foliage, arched windows whose points came right up into the vaults. and, sometimes, a wooden ceiling. Examples include [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem]], in [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands, originally built as a Catholic cathedral, now a Protestant church, and the [[Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon]] in Brussels (15th century).\n\n==Southern European Gothic==\n===Spain and Portugal===\n{{Main|Spanish Gothic architecture|Portuguese Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Catedral G\u00f3tica de Le\u00f3n.jpg|[[Le\u00f3n Cathedral]] (1205\u20131472)\nFile:KathedraleToledo.jpg|[[Toledo Cathedral]] (1227\u20131493)\nFile:Fachada de la Catedral de Burgos.jpg|[[Burgos Cathedral]] (1221\u20131260)\nFile:Catedral_de_Valencia,_Valencia,_Espa%C3%B1a,_2014-06-29,_DD_16.JPG|[[Valencia Cathedral]] (13th\u201315 c.)\nFile:Sevilla Cathedral - Southeast.jpg|[[Seville Cathedral]]\nFile:Karinecyril evora cathedrale2.JPG|[[Evora Cathedral]], [[\u00c9vora]], Portugal (1280\u20131340)\nFile:Evora53.jpg|Gothic nave of [[\u00c9vora Cathedral]], Portugal, leads to a [[Baroque]] chapel (1280\u20131340)\n</gallery>\n\nStrikingly different variations of the Gothic style appeared in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Important examples of Spanish Gothic include [[Toledo Cathedral]], [[Le\u00f3n Cathedral]], and [[Burgos Cathedral]].\nThe distinctive characteristic of Gothic cathedrals of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is their spatial complexity, with many areas of different shapes leading from each other. They are comparatively wide, and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories, giving a similar spacious appearance to the ''Hallenkirche'' of Germany, as at the Church of the [[Batalha Monastery]] in Portugal. Many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels. Like English cathedrals, each is often stylistically diverse. This expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources. Among the influences on both decoration and form are [[Islamic architecture]] and, towards the end of the period, Renaissance details combined with the Gothic in a distinctive manner. The West front, as at Leon Cathedral, typically resembles a French west front, but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces. At [[Burgos Cathedral]] there are spires of German style. The roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles. There are often towers and domes of a great variety of shapes and structural invention rising above the roof.<ref name=BF/> [[Church of San Pablo, Valladolid|Church of San Pablo]] in [[Valladolid]] is an outstanding example of construction that combines the [[Isabelline Gothic]] style (a local adaptation of the Gothic style) with the [[Renaissance architecture]].<!---DO NOT CHANGE. READ DISCUSSION PAGE--->\n\nIn the territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]] (Aragon, Catalonia, [[Roussillon]] in France, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Valencian Community]], among others in the Italian islands), the Gothic style suppressed the transept and made the [[Aisle#Church architecture|side-aisles]] almost as high as the main nave, creating wider spaces, and with few ornaments. There are two different Gothic styles in the Aragonese lands: [[Catalan Gothic]] and [[Valencian Gothic]], which are different from those in the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and France.\n\nThe most important samples of Catalan Gothic style are the cathedrals of [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], [[Perpignan]] and [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] (in [[Mallorca]]), the basilica of [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]] (in Barcelona), the [[Santa Maria del Pi, Barcelona|Bas\u00edlica del Pi]] (in Barcelona), and the church of [[Santa Maria, Manresa|Santa Maria de l'Alba]] in [[Manresa]].\n\nThe most important examples of Valencian Gothic style in the old [[Kingdom of Valencia]] are the [[Valencia Cathedral]], [[Llotja de la Seda]] (Unesco World Heritage site), [[Torres de Serranos]], Torres de Quart, [[Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba]], in [[Alfauir]], [[Palace of the Borgias]] in [[Gandia]], [[Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de la Valldigna]], [[Basilica of Santa Maria, Alicante|Basilica of Santa Maria]], in [[Alicante]], [[Orihuela Cathedral]], [[Castell\u00f3 Cathedral]] and [[El Fadr\u00ed]], [[Segorbe Cathedral]], etc.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Italian Gothic architecture|Venetian Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Duomo di Siena, April 2017.jpg|[[Siena Cathedral]] (1215\u20131263)\nFile:Toscana Siena4 tango7174.jpg|Interior of [[Siena Cathedral]] (1215\u20131263)\nFile:Facciata del Duomo di Orvieto.JPG|[[Orvieto Cathedral]] (1290\u20131591)\nFile:Interno duomo Orvieto.jpg|Nave of [[Orvieto Cathedral]] (begun 1290)\nFile:Fa\u00e7ade cath\u00e9drale Florence.jpg|[[Florence Cathedral]] (1296\u20131436)\nFile:GPisano-PulpitoPisa background blurred.JPG|Pulpit of [[Pisa Cathedral]], by [[Giovanni Pisano]] (1302\u20131310)\nFile:Toscana Pisa11 tango7174.jpg|[[Santa Maria della Spina]] (about 1323)\nFile:Milan Cathedral from Piazza del Duomo.jpg|[[Milan Cathedral]] (1386\u20131510 \u2013 facade from 19th century)\nFile:Photograph of of the Doges Palace in Venice.jpg|[[Doges Palace]] (1424\u20131442)\n</gallery>\n\n[[Italian Gothic architecture]] went its own particular way, departing from the French model. It was influenced by other styles, notably the [[Byzantine style]] introduced in [[Ravenna]]. Major examples include [[Milan Cathedral]], the [[Orvieto Cathedral]], and particularly [[Florence Cathedral]], before the addition of the Duomo in the Renaissance.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe Italian style was influenced by the materials available in the different regions; [[marble]] was available in great quantities in [[Tuscany]], and was lavishly used in churches; it was scarce in [[Lombardy]], and brick was used instead. But many of the architectural elements were used apparently mainly to be different from the French style.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=147}}\n\nThe [[Cistercian]] monastic order introduced some of the first Gothic churches into Italy, in [[Fossanova Abbey]] (consecrated 1208) and the [[Casamari Abbey]] (1203\u20131217). They followed the basic plan of the Gothic Cistercian churches of [[Burgundy]], particularly [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=148}}\n\nThe Italian plan is usually regular and symmetrical, Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns. The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated, based on the square and the concept of \"''armon\u00eca''\", and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches, the arches are almost always equilateral. Italian Gothic cathedrals often retained Romanesque features; the nave of [[Orvieto Cathedral]] had Romanesque arches and vaults.\n\nItalian cathedrals also offered a variety of plans; Florence Cathedral (begun 1246) had a rectangular choir, based on the Cistercian model, but was designed to have three wings with polygonal chapels. Italian Gothic cathedrals were generally not as tall as those in France; they rarely used flying buttresses, and generally had only two levels, an arcade and a ''claire-voie'' with small windows; but [[Bologna Cathedral]] (begun in 1388), rivalled [[Bourges Cathedral]] in France in height. The smallest notable Italian Gothic church is [[Santa Maria della Spina]] in [[Pisa]] (about 1330), which resembles a Gothic jewel box.{{sfn|Martindale|1993|p=148}}\n\nA distinctive characteristic of Italian Gothic is the use of polychrome decoration, both externally as marble veneer on the brick fa\u00e7ade and internally where the arches are often made of alternating black and white segments. The columns were sometimes painted red, and the walls were decorated with frescoes and the apse with mosaic. Italian cathedral fa\u00e7ades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors. The fa\u00e7ades have projecting open porches and ocular or wheel windows rather than roses, and do not usually have a tower. The crossing is usually surmounted by a dome. There is often a free-standing tower and baptistery. The eastern end usually has an apse of comparatively low projection. The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and, although stained glass windows are often found, the favourite narrative medium for the interior is the [[fresco]].<ref name=BF/> The facade of Orvieto Cathedral, begun in 1310, is a striking example of mosaic decoration. Another innovation of Italian Gothic is the bronze doorway covered with sculpture; the most famous examples are the doors of the [[Florence Baptistery]] by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330\u20131336).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=161\u2013175}}\n\nItalian Gothic cathedrals did not have the elaborate sculptural tympanums over the entrances of French cathedrals, but they had abundant realistic sculptural decoration. Some of the finest work was done by [[Nicola Pisano]] at the [[Pisa Baptistery]] (1259\u201360) and in [[Siena Cathedral]], and by his son [[Giovanni Pisano]] on the west facade of [[Pisa Cathedral]] (1284\u201385).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=152\u2013176}}\n\n==Gothic in the Colonial Americas==\n{{See also|Mendicant monasteries in Mexico}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Bas\u00edlica Menor de Santa Mar\u00eda CCSD 07 2017 4676.jpg|[[Basilica Cathedral of Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor]] (1514-1541) in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic<ref name=\"whc.unesco.org\"/><ref name=\"5albemarleway.co.uk\"/>\nFile:SacristyCathedralDF.JPG|A Gothic vault in the sacristy of the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]] (started to built in 1573)<ref name=\"catedralmetropolitanademexico.mx\"/>\nFile:Palacio de Cort\u00e9s 2017.jpg|[[Palace of Cort\u00e9s, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cort\u00e9s]] (1523-1528) in Cuernavaca, Mexico, this palace has a style that blends Gothic and [[Mud\u00e9jar art|Mud\u00e9jar]]<ref name=\"Routledge\"/><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\nFile:20090405-182346- eglise du couvent saint gabriel -modifi\u00e9e-.jpg|[[San Gabriel Franciscan Convent, Cholula|San Gabriel Franciscan Convent]] in [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]], Metropolitan area of Puebla City, Mexico, it is partially Gothic (built in the mid-16th century)<ref name=\"lonelyplanet.com/mexico\"/><ref name=\"inafed.gob.mx\"/>\nFile:Templo y convento de San Mateo Ap\u00f3stol.JPG|[[Earliest 16th-century monasteries on the slopes of Popocat\u00e9petl|Convent of San Mateo Ap\u00f3stol y Evangelista]] (1535-1567)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rosademaria.wordpress.com/2016/10/05/ex-convento-agustino/|title=Ex Convento Agustino|website=rosademaria.wordpress.com|date = 5 October 2016|language = Spanish}}</ref> in [[Atlatlahucan]], Mexico, is a late-Gothic [[Plateresque]] church that is a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]<ref name=\"list/702\"/>\n</gallery>\nThere are late-Gothic architecture from the era in some of the oldest Christian churches built in the Americas.

Prominent examples were built by the [[Benedictine order|Benedictines]] in England, France, and Normandy. They were the builders of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St Denis]], and [[Abbey of Saint-Remi]] in [[France]]. Later Benedictine projects (constructions and renovations) include [[Rouen]]'s [[Church of St. Ouen, Rouen|Abbey of Saint-Ouen]], the Abbey [[La Chaise-Dieu]], and the choir of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] in France.\n\nEnglish examples are [[Westminster Abbey]], originally built as a [[Benedictine]] order monastic church; and the reconstruction of [[Canterbury Cathedral|the Benedictine church at]] [[Canterbury]]. The [[Cistercian Order|Cistercians]] spread the style as far east and south as [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]].{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=28}} Smaller orders such as the [[Carthusian order|Carthusians]] and [[Premonstratensians]] also built some 200 churches, usually near cities.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=29\u201330}} The [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] also carried out a transition to Gothic in the 13th and 14th centuries. The [[Teutonic Order]], a military order, spread Gothic art into [[Pomerania]], [[East Prussia]], and the Baltic region.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=30}}\n\nThe earliest example of Gothic architecture in Germany is [[Maulbronn Monastery]], a Romanesque [[Cistercian]] abbey in southwest Germany whose [[narthex]] was built in the early 12th century by an anonymous architect.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=79}}\n\n[[Batalha Monastery]] (1386\u20131517) is a Dominican monastery in [[Batalha, Portugal]].

Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.\nThe Rouen Courthouse in Normandy is representative of Flamboyant Gothic in France.\n\nIn the 15th century, following the late Gothic or flamboyant period, elements of Gothic decoration borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in the town halls of northern France, in Flanders and in the Netherlands. The H\u00f4tel de Ville of [[Compi\u00e8gne]] has an imposing gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate [[Accolade (architecture)|accolades]] or ornamental arches.

The Gothic style was adapted from English monasteries for use in the first colleges of [[Oxford University]], including [[Magdalen College]]. It was also used at the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain. The use of the late Gothic style at Oxford and [[Cambridge University]] inspired the picturesque Gothic architecture in U.S. colleges in the 19th and 20th century.\n\nBy the late Middle Ages university towns had grown in wealth and importance as well, and this was reflected in the buildings of some of Europe's ancient universities. Particularly remarkable examples still standing nowadays include the [[Collegio di Spagna]] in the [[University of Bologna]], built during the 14th and 15th centuries; the [[Karolinum|Collegium Carolinum]] of the [[Charles University in Prague]] in Bohemia; the [[University of Salamanca|Escuelas mayores]] of the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain; the chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge]]; or the [[Collegium Maius]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland.\n\n==Military architecture==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chateau-de-Vincennes-donjon.jpg|Donjon of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]], begun 1337\nCarcasonneouterwall.jpg|Restored outer walls of the medieval city of [[Carcassonne]] (13th\u201314th century)\nFile:Chateau.Louvre.png|The Louvre in the time of [[Charles V of France]] (1338\u20131380) drawn by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]\nFile:2012.05.12 MALBORK (4).JPG|[[Malbork Castle]] in Poland (13th century)\nFile:Exterior Alcazar Segovia.jpg|[[Alcazar of Segovia]] (12th\u201313th centuries)\nFile:Burg Hohenzollern.JPG|[[Hohenzollern Castle]] (1454\u20131461) in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], southern Germany\n</gallery>\n\nIn the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]]. The new kind of fortification was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the centre, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nCastles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers. One good surviving example is the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), pg. 38</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337\u20131453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants; the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls. The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=38}}\n\n==Decline==\nBeginning in the 16th century, as [[Renaissance architecture]] from Italy began to appear in France and other countries in Europe, the dominance of Gothic architecture began to wane. Nonetheless, new Gothic buildings, particularly churches, continued to be built; new Gothic churches built in Paris in this period included [[Saint-Merri]] (1520\u20131552); and [[Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois]]; The first signs of classicism in Paris churches, at [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]], did not appear until 1540. The largest new church, [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] (1532\u20131560), rivalled Notre-Dame in size, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide, and 35 meters high. As construction of this church continued, elements of Renaissance decoration, including the system of classical orders of columns, were added to the design, making it an early Gothic-Renaissance hybrid.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pp=24\u201326}}\n\nThe Gothic style began to be described as outdated, ugly and even barbaric. The term \"Gothic\" was first used as a [[pejorative]] description. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term \"barbarous German style\" in his 1550 ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style.{{sfn|Vasari|1991|pp=117, 527}} In the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributed various architectural features to \"[[Goths|the Goths]]\" whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered [[Rome]], and erecting new ones in this style.{{sfn|Vasari|Brown|Maclehose|1907|p=83}} In the 17th century, [[Moli\u00e8re]] also mocked the Gothic style in the 1669 poem ''La Gloire'': \"...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...\"{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=9}} The dominant styles in Europe became in turn [[Italian Renaissance architecture]], [[Baroque architecture]], and the grand classicism of the [[Louis XIV style]].\n\nNonetheless, Gothic architecture, usually churches or university buildings, continued to be built.

The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass \"low church\" as well as \"high church\" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855\u20131885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].\n\nThe [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.\n\nThe middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of medieval architecture turned to technical consideration. London's Palace of Westminster, St. Pancras railway station, New York's Trinity Church and St. Patrick's Cathedral are also famous examples of Gothic Revival buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gothic-architecture|title=Gothic Architecture and Churches {{!}} Architectural Digest|website=Architectural Digest|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> Such style also reached the [[Far East]] in the period, for instance, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[St. John's Cathedral (Hong Kong)|St. John's Cathedral]] which was located at the centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]] in [[Central, Hong Kong]].\n<!--- Need to read this through \n==Influences==\n\n===Romanesque and Norman influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Durham Cathedral.

The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based upon the plan of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was adopted by Romanesque architecture. The [[Latin cross]] form, with a [[nave]] and transept, choir, disambulatory, and radiating chapels, came from the Romanesque model. The grand arcades of columns separating the central vessel of the [[nave]] from the collateral aisles, the [[triforium]] over the grand arcades, and the windows high on the walls allowing light into the nave were all also adapted from the Romanesque model. The portal with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] filled with sculpture was another characteristic Romanesque feature, as was the use of the buttress to support the walls from the outside. Gothic architects improved them by adding the [[flying buttress]] with high arches connecting the buttresses to the upper walls. In the interior, Romanesque architecture used the [[barrel vault]] with a round arch to cover the nave, and a [[groin vault]] when two barrel vaults met at right angles. These vaults were the immediate ancestors of the Gothic rib vault. The first use of the Gothic rib vaults to cover a nave was in the Romanesque [[Durham Cathedral]], (1093\u20131104).<ref name=\"auto\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2018), pp. 35-37</ref>\n\n[[Norman Architecture]], similar to the Romanesque style, also influenced the Gothic style. Early examples are found in [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy, which also featured early rib vaults in the nave similar to the Gothic vaults. [[Cefalu Cathedral]] (1131\u20131267) in Sicily, built when Sicily was under Norman rule, is another interesting example. It featured pointed arches and large Romanesque vaults combined with ornamental mosaic decoration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nRomanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto L\u00f3pez, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}} \n\n===Islamic and Armenian influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortess.jpg|[[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] (completed 775 AD), Iraq\nJerusalem-2013-Al-Aqsa Mosque 04.jpg|[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], Jerusalem\nCordoba, la Mezquita - C\u00fapula de la Maqsura.jpg|Vaulted central dome of [[Cordoba Cathedral|Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral]], Spain (784\u2013987 A.D.).

It begins to appear throughout the Islamic world in close succession after its adoption in the late Umayyad or early Abbasid period.

It also appears in one of the early reconstructions of the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, and the Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba in 987 AD. The pointed arch had already been used in Syria, but in the mosque of Ibn Tulun we have one of the earliest examples of its use on an extensive scale, some centuries before it was exploited in the West by the Gothic architects.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Islamic Art|last=Rice|first=David T.|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=1979|isbn=9780500201503|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islamicartworldo00davi/page/45 45]|url=https://archive.org/details/islamicartworldo00davi/page/45}}</ref>\n\nA kind of [[rib vault]] was also used in Islamic architecture, for example in the ceiling of the [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]]. In Cordoba, the dome was supported by [[pendentives]], which connected the dome to the arches below. The pendentives were decorated with ribs. Unlike the Gothic rib vault, the Islamic ribs were purely decorative; they did not extend outside of the vault, and they were not part of the structure supporting the roof. \n\nThe military and [[Islamic world contributions to Medieval Europe|cultural contacts with]] the [[medieval Islamic world]], including the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest]] of [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Islamic Sicily]] in 1090, the [[Crusades]] (beginning 1096), and the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic presence in Spain]], may have influenced [[Medieval Europe]]'s adoption of the pointed arch.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Bony|1983|p=17}} Another feature of Gothic architecture, a kind of rib vault, had also earlier appeared in Islamic architecture, and spread to Western Europe via [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]].<ref name=\"Bloom\"/><ref name=Giese-Vogeli>{{cite book|last=Giese-V\u00f6geli|first=Francine|title=Das islamische Rippengew\u00f6lbe : Ursprung, Form, Verbreitung |trans-title=Islamic rib vaults: Origins, form, spread|date=2007|publisher=Gebr.

It evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]] and was succeeded by [[Renaissance architecture]]. Originating in 12th century [[France]] and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as ''{{lang|la|Opus Francigenum}}'' (\"French work\") with the term ''Gothic'' first appearing during the later part of the [[Renaissance]]. \n\nThe defining element of Gothic architecture is the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]]. It is the primary engineering innovation and the characteristic design component. The use of the pointed arch in turn led to the development of the pointed [[ribbed vault]], the [[flying buttress]] and window tracery.<ref>Bannister Fletcher, 17th edition, p.367, p.524</ref> These elements together formed a structurally and aesthetically integrated system, or style, that characterises the Gothic.<ref>Moffett, Fazio and Wodehouse, p.230</ref>\n\nAt the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, the choir was reconstructed between 1140 and 1144, drawing together for the first time the developing Gothic architectural features. In doing so, a new architectural style emerged that emphasised, internally, verticality in the structural members, and the atmosphere created by the play of light through [[stained glass window]]s.{{sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nGothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great [[cathedral]]s, [[abbey]]s and churches of Europe. It is also the architecture of many [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[town hall]]s, [[Guild|guild halls]], universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings. Many of the finest examples of Gothic architecture are listed with [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s. \n\nWith the development of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Italy during the mid 15th century, the Gothic style was supplanted by the new style, but in some regions, notably England, Gothic continued to flourish and develop into the 16th century. A series of [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revivals]] began in mid-18th century England, spread through 19th century Europe and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.\n\n==Name==\nGothic architecture was known during the period as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} (\"French/[[Franks|Frankish]] work\") {{sfn|Jones|1999|p=90|ps=: \"The style was widely referred to as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} - \"[[Franks]]' work\".\"}} and in France as the ''Style Ogivale'' (style with pointed arches).<ref>Bannister Fletcher, p.524</ref>\n\nThe term \"[[Gothic (disambiguation)|Gothic]] architecture\" originated as a [[pejorative]] description. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term \"barbarous German style\" in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style,<ref name=vas>[[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari, G]]. ''The Lives of the Artists''. Translated with an introduction and notes by J.C. and [[Peter Bondanella|P. Bondanella]]. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]] (Oxford World\u2019s Classics), 1991, pp. 117 & 527. {{ISBN|9780199537198}}</ref> and in the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributes various architectural features to \"the Goths\" whom he holds responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered Rome, and erecting new ones in this style.<ref>Vasari, Giorgio. (1907) ''[https://archive.org/details/vasariontechniqu1907vasa Vasari on technique: being the introduction to the three arts of design, architecture, sculpture and painting, prefixed to the Lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors and architects]''. [[Gerard Baldwin Brown|G. Baldwin Brown]] Ed. Louisa S. Maclehose Trans. London: Dent, pp. b & 83.</ref> At the time in which Vasari was writing, Italy had experienced a century of building in the Classical architectural vocabulary revived in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and seen as evidence of a new [[Golden Age]] of learning and refinement. Vasari was echoed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], also of the 16th century, who referred to \"Gotz\" and \"Ostrogotz.\"<ref name=\"Ref_a\">\"Gotz\" is rendered as \"Huns\" in [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s English translation.</ref>\n\nAccording to a 19th-century correspondent in the London Journal ''[[Notes and Queries]]'':\n<blockquote>There can be no doubt that the term 'Gothic' as applied to pointed styles of ecclesiastical architecture was used at first contemptuously, and in derision, by those who were ambitious to imitate and revive the Grecian orders of architecture, after the revival of classical literature. Authorities such as [[Christopher Wren]] lent their aid in deprecating the old medieval style, which they termed Gothic, as synonymous with everything that was barbarous and rude.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">''[[Notes and Queries]]'', No. 9. 29 December 1849</ref><ref name=\"Ref_c\">[[Christopher Wren]], 17th-century architect of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]].</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Definition and scope==\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}} \n\nGothic architecture is the architecture of the late medieval period, characterised by use of the pointed arch.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Other features common to Gothic architecture are the rib vault, buttresses, including flying buttresses; large windows which are often grouped, or have tracery; rose windows, towers, spires and pinnacles; and ornate west fronts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAs an architectural style, Gothic developed primarily in ecclesiastical architecture,{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} and its principles and characteristic forms were applied to other types of buildings. Buildings of every type were constructed in the Gothic style, with evidence remaining of simple domestic buildings, elegant town houses, grand palaces, commercial premises, civic buildings, castles, city walls, bridges, village churches, abbey churches, abbey complexes and large cathedrals.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe greatest number of surviving Gothic buildings are churches. These range from tiny chapels to large cathedrals, and although many have been extended and altered in different styles, a large number remain either substantially intact or sympathetically restored, demonstrating the form, character and decoration of Gothic architecture. The Gothic style is most particularly associated with the great cathedrals of Northern France, the Low Countries, England and Spain, with other fine examples occurring across Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = The scope of Gothic architecture\n | image1    = Rheinstein crop.jpg\n | width1    = 149\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = [[Rheinstein Castle]], Trechtingshausen, Germany\n | image2    = Kosciol mariacki krakow.jpg\n | width2    = 137\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|Basilica of the Assumption of Mary]], Krak\u00f3w, Poland\n | image3    = St Mary Redcliffe adj sky.jpg\n | width3    = 146\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = [[St Mary Redcliffe|The Parish Church of St Mary Redcliffe]], Bristol, England\n | image4    =Tours Cathedral Saint-Gatian adj.jpg\n | width4    = 139\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = [[Tours Cathedral|The Cathedral of Saint-Gatian]], Tours, France\n | image5    =552SienaPalPubblico.JPG\n | width5    = 157\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = The [[Palazzo Pubblico]], Siena, Italy\n | image6    = 27225 Oudenaarde Stadhuis 20 adj.jpg\n | width6    = 152\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = [[Oudenaarde Town Hall]], Oudenaarde, Belgium\n | image7   = San Pablo 20131208b.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      = \n | caption7  = [[Church of San Pablo, Valladolid|Church of San Pablo]], Valladolid, Spain\n }}\n\n==Influences==\n\n===Political===\nAt the end of the 12th century, Europe was divided into a multitude of [[city state]]s and kingdoms.

[[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] kings brought the Gothic tradition from France to Southern Italy, while [[Lusignan]] kings introduced [[French Gothic]] architecture to Cyprus.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThroughout Europe at this time there was a rapid growth in trade and an associated growth in towns.<ref name=BF>Banister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''.</ref><ref name=JH1/> Germany and the Lowlands had large flourishing towns that grew in comparative peace, in trade and competition with each other, or united for mutual weal, as in the [[Hanseatic League]]. Civic building was of great importance to these towns as a sign of wealth and pride. England and France remained largely [[Feudalism|feudal]] and produced grand domestic architecture for their kings, dukes and bishops, rather than grand town halls for their burghers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Religious===\nThe [[Catholic Church]] prevailed across Western Europe at this time, influencing not only faith but also wealth and power. Bishops were appointed by the feudal lords (kings, dukes and other landowners) and they often ruled as virtual princes over large estates.  The early Medieval periods had seen a rapid growth in monasticism, with several different orders being prevalent and spreading their influence widely. Foremost were the [[Benedictines]] whose great abbey churches vastly outnumbered any others in France and England. A part of their influence was that towns developed around them and they became centres of culture, learning and commerce. The [[Cluniacs|Cluniac]] and Cistercian Orders were prevalent in France, the great monastery at [[Cluny]] having established a formula for a well planned monastic site which was then to influence all subsequent monastic building for many centuries.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JH1>John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century [[St. Francis of Assisi]] established the [[Franciscans]], or so-called \"Grey Friars\", a mendicant order. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], another mendicant order founded during the same period but by [[St. Dominic]] in [[Toulouse]] and [[Bologna]], were particularly influential in the building of Italy's Gothic churches.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JH1>John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''</ref>\n\n===Geographic===\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style.<ref name=BF/> On the other hand, some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic.<ref name=JH1/>\n\nThe local availability of materials affected both construction and style. In France, [[limestone]] was readily available in several grades, the very fine white limestone of [[Caen]] being favoured for sculptural decoration.  England had coarse limestone and red [[sandstone]] as well as dark green [[Purbeck marble]] which was often used for architectural features.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn Northern Germany, Netherlands, northern Poland, Denmark, and the Baltic countries local building stone was unavailable but there was a strong tradition of building in brick. The resultant style, [[Brick Gothic]], is called \"Backsteingotik\" in Germany and Scandinavia and is associated with the Hanseatic League.  In Italy, stone was used for fortifications, but brick was preferred for other buildings. Because of the extensive and varied deposits of marble, many buildings were faced in marble, or were left with undecorated fa\u00e7ade so that this might be achieved at a later date.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe availability of timber also influenced the style of architecture, with timber buildings prevailing in Scandinavia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Availability of timber affected methods of roof construction across Europe. It is thought that the magnificent [[hammer-beam]] roofs of England were devised as a direct response to the lack of long straight seasoned timber by the end of the Medieval period, when forests had been decimated not only for the construction of vast roofs but also for ship building.<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT>Alec Clifton-Taylor, ''The Cathedrals of England''</ref>\n\n==Architectural background and early development== \n\n===Oriental influence===\nThe pointed arch, one of the defining attributes of Gothic, was employed in Late Roman and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] architecture by the 7th century. In the Roman context it occurred in early church building in Syria and occasional secular structures, like the [[Karamagara Bridge]] in Modern Turkey. In the Sassanid architecture of Iran, parabolic and pointed arches were employed in both palace and sacred construction.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Warren\n | first = John\n | year = 1991\n | title = Creswell's Use of the Theory of Dating by the Acuteness of the Pointed Arches in Early Muslim Architecture\n | periodical = Muqarnas\n | volume = 8\n | pages = 59\u201365 (61\u201363)\n | doi = 10.2307/1523154\n | jstor = 1523154\n | publisher=BRILL\n}}</ref><ref>Petersen, Andrew (2002-03-11).

For the most part, there was not a clean break, as there was to be later in [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] with the revival of the [[Classical style]] in the early 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nBy the 12th century, Romanesque architecture (termed [[Norman architecture]] in England because of its association with the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]]), was established throughout Europe. The important categories of building: the [[cathedral]] church, the [[parish church]], the [[abbey church]], the [[monastery]], the [[castle]], the [[palace]], the [[great hall]], the [[gatehouse]], the [[town hall|civic building]] and the [[warehouse]], had been established in the Romanesque period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nMany architectural features that are associated with Gothic architecture had been developed and used by the architects of Romanesque buildings, particularly in the building of cathedrals and abbey churches.. These include [[ribbed vault]]s, [[buttress]]es, clustered columns, ambulatories, [[Rose window|wheel windows]], spires, stained glass windows, and richly carved door tympana. These were already features of ecclesiastical architecture before the development of the Gothic style, and all were to develop in increasingly elaborate ways.<ref name=NP>Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture''.</ref>\n\nIt was principally the widespread introduction of a single feature, the pointed arch, which was to bring about the change that separates Gothic from Romanesque. This technological change permitted both structural and stylistic change which broke the tradition of massive masonry and solid walls penetrated by small openings, replacing it with a style where light appears to triumph over substance. With its use came the development of many other architectural devices, previously put to the test in scattered buildings and then called into service to meet the structural, aesthetic and ideological needs of the new style. These include the flying buttresses, pinnacles and traceried windows which typify Gothic ecclesiastical architecture.<ref name=BF/>\n\n===Transition from Romanesque to Gothic architecture=== \nThe characteristic forms that were to define Gothic architecture developed in Romanesque buildings at different locations, as the result of structural requirements.\n\nAlthough the pointed arch is strongly associated with the Gothic style, it was first used in Western architecture in buildings that were in other ways clearly Romanesque, notably [[Autun Cathedral]] in France, [[Durham Cathedral]] in the north of England, and [[Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9|Cefal\u00f9]] and [[Monreale Cathedral]]s in Sicily.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe vaults of most Romanesque churches were barrel vaults or groin vaults. By the early 12th century the ribbed vaults, characteristic of Gothic architecture, were coming into use. They appeared at the naves of two Romanesque churches in Caen, France, the [[Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen|Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and the [[Abbaye aux Dames]] in 1120. The ribbed vault over the north transept at [[Durham Cathedral]] in England, built from 1128 to 1133, was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault. Pointed ribbed vaults were used in the chancel of [[Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9]] in 1131.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe three-tiered interior elevation of arcade, gallery and clerestory that is typical of great Gothic churches, was well established in the Norman buildings of England, appearing at [[norwich Cathedral|Norwich]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] and Durham Cathedrals as well as the Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen, in France.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nOne of the features that unifies the internal appearance of a great Gothic church is the emphasis on vertical elements, in particular attached shafts that pass from the floor to the vault.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} These first appeared in France in the early 11th century in churches that have broad ribs reinforcing a barrel vault. They are also seen at [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey|la Madeleine Vezelay]] in conjunction with groin vaults, as well as at the three Norman cathedrals of East Anglia, of which Peterborough and Ely retain wooden ceilings, while Norwich was not vaulted until the 15th century.\n\nThe admission of light to the building through a multiplicity of windows was an important element in England. At Peterborough Cathedral, the polygonal Norman apse has remained, as has three tiers of large Norman windows, now filled with Gothic tracery and 19th century stained glass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The transept ends at Peterborough, Ely and Norwich each have three rows of large Norman windows. This grouping of windows prefigures the clusters of Gothic lancet windows that are found in many English churches such [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Rose window]]s, which are characteristic of the west fronts and transept ends of the cathedrals of France, were in the Romanesque period, common in architecture of Germany, where they appear in various forms at [[Worms Cathedral]], and in Italy where they are either untraceried ocula or wheel windows such as that at the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], Verona. The first rose window above the west portal in France is said to be that at the [[Basilica of Saint Denis|Abbaye Saint-Denis]] 1140. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] is generally cited as the first truly Gothic building, however the distinction is best reserved for the choir, of which the [[ambulatory]] remains intact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} [[Noyon Cathedral]] saw the earliest completion of a rebuilding of an entire French cathedral in the new style from 1150 to 1231.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} While using all those features that came to be known as Gothic, including pointed arches, flying buttresses and ribbed vaulting, the builders continued to employ many of the features and much of the character of Romanesque architecture including round-headed arch throughout the building, varying the shape to pointed where it was functionally practical to do so.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt the Abbey Saint-Denis, [[Sens Cathedral]], Noyon Cathedral, [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England, simple cylindrical columns predominate over the Gothic forms of clustered columns and shafted piers. [[Wells Cathedral]] in England, commenced at the eastern end in 1175, was the first building in which the designer broke free from Romanesque forms. The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by Adam Locke in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic. Wells Cathedral is thus considered the first truly Gothic cathedral.<ref>Cannon, J. 2007. Cathedral: The Great English Cathedrals and the World that Made Them</ref> \n\n<!---Needs icorporating-  The first cathedral in France built entirely in the new style was  [[Sens Cathedral]], begun between 1135 and 1140 and consecrated in 1160.{{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}<ref> ''Le Guide du Patrimoine de France'' (2002) pg. 53</ref>  Sens Cathedral  features a Gothic choir, and six-part rib vaults over the nave and collateral aisles, alternating pillars and doubled columns to support the vaults, and buttresses to offset the outward thrust from the vaults.  One of the builders who is believed to have worked on Sens Cathedral, [[William of Sens]], later traveled to England and became the architect who, between 1175 and 1180, reconstructed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in the new Gothic style. {{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}\n\nSens was quickly followed by  [[Senlis Cathedral]] (begun 1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 36</ref>  ---/>\n\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | perrow    = 4\n | total_width= \n\n | image1    = Ely Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1766558.jpg\n | width1    = 168\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The south western tower at Ely Cathedral, England\n\n | image2    = Durham.2 crop.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The nave vault with pointed transverse arches at Durham Cathedral\n\n | image3    = Abbaye aux hommes int\u00e9rieur 03.jpeg\n | width3    = 170\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = The sexpartite ribbed vault at Saint Etienne, Caen\n\n | image4    = Cefalu Cathedral interior BW 2012-10-11 12-07-53.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = interior of the [[Cathedral of Cefalu]].\n}}\n\n===Abbot Suger===\nThe eastern end of the [[St Denis Basilica|Basilica Church of Saint-Denis]], built by [[Abbot Suger]] and completed in 1144, is often cited as the first truly Gothic building, as it draws together many of architectural forms which had evolved from the Romanesque and typify the Gothic style.\n\nSuger, friend and confidant of the French Kings, [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], decided in about 1137, to rebuild the great Church of Saint-Denis, attached to an abbey which was also a royal residence. He began with the West Front, reconstructing the original [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] fa\u00e7ade with its single door. He designed the west front of Saint-Denis to be an echo of the Roman [[Triumphal Arch of Constantine|Arch of Constantine]] with its three-part division and three large portals to ease the problem of congestion. The [[rose window]] is the earliest-known example above the West portal in France. The fa\u00e7ade combines both round arches and pointed arches of the Gothic style.\n\nAt the completion of the west front in 1140, Abbot Suger moved on to the reconstruction of the eastern end, leaving the Carolingian nave in use. He designed a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] that would be suffused with light.<ref name=\"Ref_f\">[[Erwin Panofsky]] argued that Suger was inspired to create a physical representation of the Heavenly [[Jerusalem]], although the extent to which Suger had any aims higher than aesthetic pleasure has been called into doubt by more recent art historians on the basis of Suger's own writings.</ref> To achieve his aims, his masons drew on the several new features which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture, the pointed arch, the ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], the ambulatory with radiating chapels, the clustered columns supporting ribs springing in different directions and the flying buttresses which enabled the insertion of large ''clerestory'' windows.\n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].<ref name=gothicplantagenet/><ref name=JH1/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | perrow    = 6\n | total_width \n | image1    = Saint-Denis - Basilique - Ext\u00e9rieur fa\u00e7ade ouest.JPG\n | width1    = 175\n | height1    = \n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The west front at the Abbey of Saint Denis, with its three deep portals\n | image2    = Basilica Saint Denis ambulatory.JPG\n | width2    = 160\n | height2    = \n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The ambulatory at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|Abbey of Saint-Denis]]\n | image3    = PM 103495 F Sens.jpg\n | width3    = 142 \n | height3   =\n | alt3      = \n | caption3   = The choir of Sens Cathedral \n | image4    = PM 103531 F Sens.jpg\n | width4    = 150 \n | height4   =\n | alt4      = \n | caption4   = The nave of Sens Cathedral \n | image5    = Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG\n | width5    = 155\n | height5    = \n | alt5      = \n | caption5  = The west front at Noyon Cathedral, showing transitional characteristics\n | image6    =Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (Noyon)-Abside et ch\u0153ur adjusted.jpg\n | width6    = 155\n | height6    = \n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The interior of Noyon Cathedral\n }}\n\n==Importance of cathedrals and great churches in Gothic architecture==\nWhile many secular buildings exist from the Late Middle Ages, it is in the buildings of cathedrals and great churches that Gothic architecture displays its pertinent structures and characteristics to the fullest advantage. A Gothic [[cathedral]] or [[abbey]] was, prior to the 20th century, generally the landmark building in its town, rising high above all the domestic structures and often surmounted by one or more [[tower]]s and pinnacles and perhaps tall [[spire]]s.<ref name=BF/><ref name=Swaan>Wim Swaan, ''The Gothic Cathedral''</ref> Each cathedral served as a regional religious centre for its surrounding diocese, and with the large town churches, was a focus of community and civic pride.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIt is in the architecture of these grand Gothic churches that a unique combination of existing technologies established a new building style.

There are several regional variations on this plan. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing, and in England is often surmounted by a stone tower, as at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[York Minster]], visible on a groundplan by the sturdy piers that support the tower. (see below){{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe nave is generally flanked on either side by aisles, usually single as at York Minster and [[Florence Cathedral]] but sometimes double as at [[bourges Cathedral|Bourges]] and [[Cologne Cathedral]]s. (see plans below). Aisles may extend along the sides of the transepts as well, as at Cologne, [[Amiens Cathedral]] and York Minster.(see plans) In the South of France there is often a single wide nave and no aisles, as at [[Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges]] and [[Albi Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some churches with double aisles, or additional rows of chapels between the buttresses as at [[Notre Dame, Paris]], the transept does not project beyond the aisles (See plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In English cathedrals, transepts tend to project boldly and there may be two of them, as at Salisbury and [[Lincoln Cathedral]]s. The double transepts are to provide extra chapels, in lieu of the apsidal chapels found in French cathedrals (See Salisbury plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In France and Germany, the eastern end is generally polygonal and surrounded by a continuation of the choir aisle called an [[ambulatory]]. Surrounding the ambulatory may be a ring of chapels called a \"[[chevet]]\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn England the eastern arm is generally long and may have two distinct sections- choir and presbytery. It is almost always square ended with a cliff-like exterior face. Often there is a projecting ''Lady Chapel'', dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], as at Salisbury.<ref name=BF/><ref name=NP/><ref name=Swaan/>\n\nIn Italy, the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually a shallow chapel, as at [[Santa Maria Novella]], or sometimes an apsidal end containing the sanctuary, as at [[Florence Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}.\n\nThe groundplans of the cathedrals show not only the larger parts of the building, developed for [[Catholic liturgy]]- the nave, aisles, transept, choir and chapels - but also reveal that each building contains a pattern of regular divisions called \"bays\". These bays or compartments are square, rectangular and sometimes trapezoidal, and are defined by the positions of the piers, columns and attached shafts that support the arcades and the overhead vaults. While internally the divisions are created by the locations of the vertical members, externally, the bays can be determined by the positions of the buttresses.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=14, 17}}\n\nOther elements that are visible on the plans are the locations of towers on the west fronts, porches such as those at Bourges and Salisbury, and the octagonal [[Chapter House]] at York Minster.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =\n | image1    = Plan.cathedrale.Bourges.png\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = [[Bourges Cathedral]], France, length 125 m.\n | image2    = Plan.redress\u00e9.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = [[Notre Dame de Paris]], France, length 128 m.\n | width2    = 210\n | image3    = Amiens plan vert.png\n | width3    = 170\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = [[Amiens Cathedral]], France, length 145 m.\n | image4    = Plan.cathedrale.Cologne.png\n | width4    = 262\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = [[Cologne Cathedral]], Germany, length 144 m, completed C19th, to dimensions established in C14th \n | image5    = Salisbury cathedral plan vert.jpg\n | width5    = 170\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = [[Salisbury Cathedral]], England, length 135 m\n | image6    = YorkMinsterPlanDehio vert.jpg\n | width6    = 265\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = [[York Minster]], England, length 159 m\n }}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Elevation===\nThe most common elevation for a Gothic cathedral is that of the architectural form known as the \"basilica\". This term, used architecturally, does not have any ecclesiastical or spiritual significance such as is associated with Catholic basilicas that have been designated by the pope as a church of great significance, e.g. the [[Basilica of St Peter]], in Rome, or the [[Rosary Basilica|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary]] at Lourdes. (see [[Papal Basilica]] and [[Minor Basilica]])\n\nArchitecturally, a basilica is a church that has a longitudinal nave, with a lower aisle on each side, separated by rows of columns or piers, and generally with windows let into that part of the nave that rises above the outer roof of the aisles. This upper section is called the [[clerestorey]]. This architectural form is so named because it was commonly used by ancient Roman builders as the structure for secular [[Roman basilica|basilicas]] used as halls for meetings, markets and as places of justice. Early Christian churches such as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, and [[San Apollinare in Classe]] have this form, which was adopted by Romanesque builders for their great abbeys and cathedrals, across Europe, such as Durham Cathedral, Saint-Etienne, Caen, and Monreale Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the Gothic period, most cathedrals were built with a single aisle on each side of the nave, such as Salisbury Cathedral, but some had double aisles with the outer lower than the inner, such as Bourges Cathedral. In the South of France cathedrals are sometimes just a single high, wide hall, with tall windows but no aisles, and the lower stage giving a robust fortified appearance, such as [[Albi Cathedral]]. Gothic churches of the Germanic tradition, like [[Stephansdom (Vienna)|St. Stephen of Vienna]], often have nave and aisles of similar height, without clerestoreys, and are called ''[[Hall church|Hallenkirche]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nInternally, the nave and choir are usually divided horizontally into three stages, the arcade, the triforium gallery and the clerestorey.

One of the best known and most typical of such west fronts is that of Notre Dame de Paris.  To emphasise its importance, the west front may be of a powerful design, with towers, imposing portals, jutting buttresses, gables, windows and an array of sculpture. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nCentral to the west front is the main portal, often flanked by additional doors, after the manner of Suger's west front at the Basilica of Saint Denis. In England, the lateral doors may be present but relatively insignificant. In the arch of the central door, particularly in France, the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], is often a significant piece of sculpture, most frequently ''Christ in Majesty'' or ''the [[Last Judgment]]''. If there is a central doorjamb or a [[Trumeau (architecture)|trumeau]], then it frequently bears a statue of Jesus or the ''Madonna and Child'' if the dedication is to Mary.  Figures in niches set into the mouldings around the portals.  \n\nAbove the main portal there is a large window which lights the nave. In France and Spain this is generally a [[rose window]] as at Notre Dame de Paris and [[Burgos Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In Italy there is generally an untraceried ocular window as at Santa Maria Novella.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, rose windows are rare and the west end is generally dominated by a  single very large traceried window as at York Minster and Canterbury, while some Early English fronts retain rows of lancet windows as at Salisbury and [[Ripon Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe west front of most French cathedrals and many English, Spanish and German cathedrals have two towers, which, particularly in France, express an enormous diversity of form and decoration.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JH1/> In Germany and Eastern Europe there may be a single tall tower at the western end as at [[Freiburg M\u00fcnster]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, where the principle tower is usually over the crossing, the west front may be framed by large turrets,{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}   \n\nIn Italy, with the exception of [[Milan Cathedral]], the form of a Gothic west front is less strongly architectonic and sculptural than in other parts of Europe.

The position, construction and height of these towers  is as subject to variety as the nature of the west front, and was already well established by the beginning of the Gothic period. \n\nIn many parts of Europe, the location of twin towers on the west front of cathedrals was usual in the Romanesque period and may be seen at Abbaye les Hommes, Caen; [[Southwell Cathedral]], England; [[Lisbon Cathedral]], Portugal; [[Magdeburg Cathedral]], Germany; [[Cefalu Cathedral]], Sicily, and [[L\u00e9b\u00e9ny]] Abbey Church, Hungary.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Romanesque churches in the Rhineland often had many towers of different shapes, as did the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey Church of Cluny]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In mainland Italy, churches generally had one tower and that was freestanding from the building, sometimes at a distance, as at [[Pisa Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In Norman England, the crossing of large churches was often marked by a large tower, while abbey churches and cathedrals might have western towers as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Smaller churches, across Europe often had a single tower at the west.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The various configurations of church and tower of the Romanesque period continued into the Gothic, but with a greater emphasis on height. \n\nIn France, the plan for the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] called for two towers of equal height on the west front, and this plan was copied during the Gothic era at [Notre-Dame de Paris]], with towers of 69 meters (226&nbsp;ft) in height, and at other cathedrals of northern France such as Laon, Reims and Amiens.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=95\u201398}} Some of these churches were given towers over the crossing and transepts as well, with Rouen having three large towers, Laon having five, and the Romanesque Abbaey les Hommes, Caen, receiving additional towers during the Gothic period, until they numbered nine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  French Gothic towers are sometimes topped with spires.  [[Chartres Cathedral]]  has two on the western towers, of different dates and very different construction. That on the south is the tallest masonry spire of the 12th century, while that on the north is a highly elaborate Flamboyant design. The irregularity seen at Chartres also occurs at Rouen where there is a central tower in addition to the western towers. This tower displays another distinctly French feature, a delicate openwork [[fl\u00e8che]] made of wood covered with lead.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nOpenwork spires of stone, sometimes of great height, were popular in the Flamboyant period, occurring singly at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], Burgos Cathedral, Freiburg Cathedral, [[Stefansdom]], Vienna; and also at Cologne Cathedral and Ulm Minster, both designed in the Medieval period but not realised until the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn England, during the Gothic era, there was a continuing fashion for three towers, with the largest being that over the crossing. This arrangement is seen at Canterbury, Wells, Lincoln, York, Lichfield. and Durham Cathedrals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, wherever the ground was considered stable, the central tower was surmounted by a spire. Like the south spire of Chartres Cathedral, English spires are often constructed of masonry. The earliest is the comparatively small spire at Oxford Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The tallest Medieval masonry spire is that built in the 13th century at Salisbury Cathedral (123 m - 404 ft).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Others exist at Norwich and [[Chichester Cathedral]]s, while [[Lichfield Cathedral]] has three.  Other cathedrals had tall spires of wooden construction sheathed with lead or copper. Two of these, on the central towers of Lincoln Cathedral and [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] surpassed 550 feet in height and were the tallest structures prior to the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nEngland's Gothic parish churches and collegiate churches generally have a single western tower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} A number of the finest churches have masonry spires, with those of St James Church, Louth; St Wulfram's Church, Grantham; St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, and St Michael's, Coventry, all exceeding 85 metres (280 feet) in height.<ref>Julian Flannery, ''Fifty English Steeples: The Finest Medieval Parish Church Towers and Spires in England'', T&H, 2016, 10-0500343144</ref>  \n\nIn mainland [[Italy]], the tower, if present, is sometimes detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], or projects from the side of the building as at the Basilica of Santa Croce. In Italy there is no defined stylistic break between Romanesque and Gothic, as the architects had a seemingly pragmatic approach to the use of round and pointed arches. Towers of apparently Romanesque form often appear in conjunction with otherwise gothic structures. They tend to have graded series of openings in the Romanesque manner like the tower of the [[Badia Fiorentina]].  Some, like the tower at Santa Croce, have large openings of Gothic form and are surmounted by spires.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn addition to towers and spires, great Medieval churches, may have several other architectural forms, rising above the roofline, particularly over the crossing. These include the octagonal tower at Burgos Cathedral, the wooden octagonal tower at Ely Cathedral and the octagonal dome of Florence Cathedral, conceived in the late Gothic period and engineered by the Renaissance architect, Filippo Brunelleschi.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Towers and spires\n\n | image1    = Cathedrale laon facade 2012.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Laon Cathedral- the strongly articulated towers of the west front. \n\n | image2    = Facade cathedral.jpg\n | width2    = 150\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Chartres Cathedral- C12th masonry spire, and Flamboyant spire \n\n | image3    = Canterbury-15.jpg\n | width3    = 167\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Canterbury Cathedral - the large tower over the crossing \n\n | image4    = Rouen Cathedral as seen from Gros Horloge 140215 4.jpg\n | width4    = 140\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Rouen Cathedral- three different towers and a lead-covered fleche\n\n | image5    = Spire Cathedral St Stephen Vienna Wien Steffl 1.jpg\n | width5    = 137\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = St Stephan's Cathedral, Vienna- openwork stone spire \n\n | image6    = Lichfield Cathedral.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = Lichfield Cathedral- three masonry spires, the central being taller. \n\n | image7    = 26-Ely-004.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Ely Cathedral- the wooden octagon rises from an octagonal stone tower\n\n | image8    = Badia Fiorentina from Palazzo Vecchio n01.jpg\n | width8    = 150\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Badia Fiorentina, Florence- tall campanile with spire\n }}\n\n==Structural elements == \n\n===Pointed arch===\n[[File:Romanesque blind arcading at Christchurch Priory.jpg|thumb|Norman [[Blind arcade|blind-arcading]] at Christchurch Priory, Dorset.]]\nOne of the defining characteristics of Gothic architecture is the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed or ogival arch]].

This latter occurs at [[Durham Cathedral]] in the nave aisles in 1093.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance |title=Architectural Importance |publisher=Durham World Heritage Site |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>  Pointed arches also occur extensively in Romanesque decorative blind arcading, where semi-circular arches overlap each other in a simple decorative pattern, and the points are accidental to the design.\n\nIn Gothic architecture the pointed arch is used in every location where a vaulted shape is called for, both structural and decorative. Gothic openings such as doorways, windows, arcades and galleries have pointed arches. Gothic [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] above spaces both large and small is usually supported by richly moulded ribs. \n\nWhile structurally, use of the pointed arch gave a greater flexibility to architectural form, it also gave Gothic architecture a very different and more vertical visual character than Romanesque.  Rows of pointed arches upon delicate shafts form a typical wall decoration known as blind arcading. Niches with pointed arches and containing statuary are a major external feature of Gothic cathedrals. The pointed arch lent itself to elaborate intersecting shapes which developed within window spaces into complex Gothic tracery forming the structural support of the large windows that are characteristic of the style.<ref name=CT/><ref name=NP/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Pointed arches\n | image1    = North_Bay_Peterborough_Cathedral.JPG\n | width1    = 171\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = One of three large arches that screen the front of Peterborough Cathedral. \n | image2    = Catedral de Salisbury, Salisbury, Inglaterra, 2014-08-12, DD 35-37 HDR.JPG\n | width2    = 124\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The North transept of Salisbury Cathedral has grouped lancet openings \n | image3    =  Lincoln, Cathedral 20060726 015.jpg \n | width3    = 168\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = LIncoln Cathedral has arades, galleries, clerestory, vault, and blind arcades of pointed arches\n | image4    = Florencia - Firenze - Basilica de Santa Maria Novella - Interior - 01.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = At Santa Maria Novella, the wedge-shaped voussoirs that support the pointed vault are emphasised by colour.  \n | image5    = Wells-Cathedral 9762.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = The eastern end of Wells Cathedral evolved in three stages to form a harmonious vista of pointed arches. \n | image6    = Reims Cathedral, exterior (4).jpg\n | width6    = 168\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The west front of Reims Cathedral shows the pointed arches of portals and galleries combined with gables and rose window. \n | image7    = Cathedrale-de-Strasbourg-IMG 4235.jpg\n | width7    = 150\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = A detail of the windows and galleries of the west front of Strasbourg Cahedral \n }}\n\n\n===Ribbed vault=== \n\nThe Gothic [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] of pointed arches, unlike the semi-circular vault of Roman and Romanesque buildings, can be used to roof rectangular and irregularly shaped plans such as [[trapezoids]]. The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle. This enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture.<ref name=BF/>\n\nIn Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the [[barrel vault]]s that covered the nave pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. Gothic architects found a solution through an innovative use of the rib vault.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\nAn early kind of rib vault, used at [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]] (8th century), was found under a [[cupola]] or [[dome]], but was different in form and function from the later Gothic rib vault. The cupola itself was supported by [[pendentive]]s or [[squinch]]es, a practice used in [[Byzantine architecture]]. The ribs were decorative. The vaults in churches in [[Sicily]] dated to the 11th century, after Sicily had been conquered by the Normans, and resembled the vaults used at the same time in Normandy and England.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nGothic builders designed a new and lighter kind of rib vault. They divided into compartments by a diagonal crossing of thin stone ribs (''ogives''), and completed by two additional arcs perpendicular and parallel to the nave (''doubleaux'' and ''formerets''). They also made innovative use of the broken arch or pointed arch. In Islamic and Romanesque architecture, pointed arches had usually been used in doorways and windows. Gothic architects used them at the meeting points of the ribs at the top of the vaults, which distributed the weight of the roof downwards and outwards, not just downwards.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}} These ribs divided the early vaults into six compartments, each as wide as two traverses of the nave. Some of the ribs went downwards as [[colonette]]s and were bundled into pillars on the ground floor. Other ribs carried the thrust outwards to the walls, where it was counterbalanced by heavy flying buttresses outside the walls. Since the weight was supported by pillars and buttresses, the walls themselves could be much higher and thinner. This made possible the expanses of [[stained glass]] that were a characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic rib vaults, used at Notre-Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, were very difficult to build, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was simplified, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vaults also made it possible to build the cathedrals even higher. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1163 with four-part vaults, reached a height of 35 meters, remarkable for the time. [[Amiens Cathedral]], begun in 1220 with four-part ribs, reached the height of 42.30 meters (138.8 feet) at the transept.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=18-28}}\n\nIn the later period of the Gothic style, from the early 14th century, the rib vaults lost their elegant simplicity and were loaded with additional ribs, sculptural designs, and sometimes pendants and other purely decorative elements.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Ribbed vaults\n | image1    = B\u00f3veda de catedral de Notre Dame de Par\u00eds 3.jpg\n | width1    = 144\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame, Paris- square, sexpartite vaults spanning two nave bays\n | image2    = Salisbury Cathedral Interior 01.jpg\n | width2    = 162\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Salisbury Cathedral, England- rectangular quadripartite vault over single bay\n | image3    = Lincoln cathedral 13 Nave vault.jpg\n | width3    = 162\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Lincoln Cathedral, England- quadripartite form, with tierceron ribs and ridge rib with carved bosses. \n | image4    = \n | width4    = 155\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  =   \n | image5    = Bremer Dom Juli 2009 PD 060.JPG\n | width5    = 144\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Bremer Cathedral, Germany- north aisle, a reticular (net) vault with intersecting ribs. \n | image6    = Wolfsberg Sankt Marein Pfarrkirche Mariae Himmelfahrt Netzrippengewoelbe 03092014 742.jpg\n | width6    = 144\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = St Marien's, Wolfsberg, Austria- stellar vault with intersecting lierne ribs.  \n | image7    = B\u00f3vedas catedral Salamanca 40.jpg\n | width7    = 162\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Salamanca Cathedral, Spain- vault has Flamboyant S-shaped and circular lierne ribs, \n | image8    = Peterborough Retrochoir fan vaulting.JPG\n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Peterborough Cathedral retrochoir- fan vaulting, which further evolved into pemdant vaulting. \n }}\n\n===Buttresses===\nAnother important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses. The earliest Gothic cathedrals, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses. Their walls were supported by heavy stone [[abutment]]s placed directly against the walls. The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.\n\nIn the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]]. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rainwater off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone [[gargoyles]] placed in rows on the buttresses.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=50\u201351}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Buttresses\n | image1    = Strebewerk-2.jpg\n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Section of Reims Cathedral with flying buttress over single aisles. \n | image2    =Lincoln, UK - panoramio (30).jpg\n | width2    = 247\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =  East end of Lincoln Cathedral, with wall buttress, and chapter house with flying buttresses. \n | image3    = Canterbury Cathedral 04.JPG\n | width3    = 245\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Wall buttresses and simple flying buttresses behind a parapet at Canterbury Cathedral\n | image4    = Amiens Cath\u00e9drale Notre-dame arc-boutant sud-est 4.jpg\n | width4    = 247\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The complex buttresses of Amiens Cathedral support one of the highest Gothic vaults \n | image5    = Arri\u00e8re de la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris en mars 2014.jpg\n | width5    = 274\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  The east end of Notre Dame de Pariswith flying buttresses supporting the high vault\n }}\n\n==Architectural character==\n\n===Height===\nA characteristic of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and in proportion to its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. A section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/>\n\nExternally, [[tower]]s and [[spire]]s are characteristic of Gothic churches both great and small, the number and positioning being one of the greatest variables in Gothic architecture. In Italy, the tower, if present, is almost always detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], and is often from an earlier structure. In France and Spain, two towers on the front is the norm. In England, Germany and Scandinavia this is often the arrangement, but an English cathedral may also be surmounted by an enormous tower at the crossing. Smaller churches usually have just one tower, but this may also be the case at larger buildings, such as [[Salisbury Cathedral]] or [[Ulm Minster]], which has the tallest spire in the world,<ref name=\"Ref_g\">The open-work spire was completed in 1890 to the original design.</ref> slightly exceeding that of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the tallest which was actually completed during the medieval period, at {{convert|160|m|ft}}.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center \n | perrow    = 6\n | header    = Height\n\n| image1    = \u00c9glise Sainte-Marie de L\u00fcbeck.jpg\n | width1   = 175\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The tallest wood and copper spires, in the world, Lubeck Cathedral, Germany. <small>rebuilt post WWII</small>\n\n | image2    = Lincoln Cathedral, Central Tower.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Lincoln Cathedral- the large central tower, carried the tallest spire in the world \n\n | image3    =  Salisbury Cathedral from West.JPG\n | width3    = 146\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = The tallest spire of the C13th century, and tallest masonry spire ever built, at Salisbury Cathedral. \n\n | image4    = Cathedrale Strasbourg vue generale.jpg\n | width4    = 146\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The openwork spire of Strasbourg Cathedral, the tallest stone spire of the  Gothic era.  \n\n | image5    = Westturm und Hahnent\u00fcrme des Freiburger M\u00fcnsters vom Schlossberg 2.jpg\n | width5    = 164\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = The tallest remaining medieval spire in Germany, at Freiburg Minster \n\n | image6    = Cupola di santa maria del fiore dal campanile di giotto, 02.JPG\n | width6    = 165\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The dome of Florence Cathedral, designed c. 1370, engineered by [[Brunelleschi]], C15th  \n\n | image7    =  London UK Interior-of-Westminster-Abbey-02.jpg \n | width7    = 152\n | alt7      = Photo by CEphoto, Uwe Aranas\n | caption7  =  Westminster Abbey, nave- 31 m (102 ft)\n\n | image8    = 0 Amiens - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (4).JPG\n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  =  The choir of Amiens Cathedral, 42.3 m (139 ft)\n\n | image9   = CologneCathedralAltar.jpg\n | width9    = 160\n | alt9      =\n | caption9  = Cologne Cathedral, choir 43.35 m (142.2 ft)\n\n | image10   = Palma LaSeu interior crop.jpg\n | width10    = 155\n | alt10      =\n | caption10  = Le Seu,Palma, Mallorca, nave, 44 m (144 ft)\n\n | image11    = Florenca122.jpg\n | width11    = 174\n | alt11      =\n | caption11  = The nave of Florence Cathedral, 45 m (148 ft)   \n\n | image12    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais, choeur.jpg\n | width12    = 158\n | alt12      =\n | caption12  = The choir of Beauvais Cathedral, 47.5 m (156 ft) \n  }}\n\n\n<!---===Height===\nAn important characteristic of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and in proportion to its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nBeauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century, the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nA section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England, the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at Beauvais Cathedral at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/> --->\n\n====Vertical emphasis====\nThe pointed arch lends itself to a suggestion of height. This appearance is characteristically further enhanced by both the architectural features and the decoration of the building.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\nOn the exterior, the verticality is emphasised in a major way by the towers and spires and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by narrow half-columns called ''attached shafts'' which often pass through several storeys of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated. The roofline, gable ends, buttresses and other parts of the building are often terminated by small pinnacles, [[Milan Cathedral]] being an extreme example in the use of this form of decoration.\n\nOn the interior of the building attached shafts often sweep unbroken from floor to ceiling and meet the ribs of the vault, like a tall tree spreading into branches. The verticals are generally repeated in the treatment of the windows and wall surfaces. In many Gothic churches, particularly in France, and in the ''Perpendicular period'' of [[English Gothic architecture]], the treatment of vertical elements in gallery and window tracery creates a strongly unifying feature that counteracts the horizontal divisions of the interior structure.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = \n | image1    = Reims - 2013-08-27 - IMG 2265.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = West front of Reims Cathedral \n\n | image2    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais ext 106.JPG\n | width2    = 167\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The exterior of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral \n\n | image3    = Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg\n | width3    = 150\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Figures around the central door of Chartres Cathedral \n | image4    = The Five Sisters - geograph.org.uk - 770345.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The Five Sister windows in the north transept at York Minster\n | image5    = PM 103594 F Bourges.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  A clustered column of the nave at Bourges Cathedral  \n | image6    = Koelner dom nordseite des chors.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = Vertical elements in the galleries at Cologne Cathedral \n | image7    =Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = The buttresses pinnacles of the choir at Cologne Cathedral \n\n }}\n\n===Light===\nExpansive interior light has been a feature of Gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened. The metaphysics of light in the Middle Ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings. Much of this belief was based on the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a sixth-century mystic whose book, [[The Celestial Hierarchy]], was popular among monks in France. Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine. To promote such faith, the abbot in charge of the Saint-Denis church on the north edge of Paris, the [[Abbot Suger]], encouraged architects remodelling the building to make the interior as bright as possible.\n\nEver since the remodelled [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] opened in 1144, Gothic architecture has featured expansive windows, such as at [[Sainte Chapelle]], [[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The increase in size between windows of the Romanesque and Gothic periods is related to the use of the ribbed vault, and in particular, the pointed ribbed vault which channelled the weight to a supporting shaft with less outward thrust than a semi-circular vault. Walls did not need to be so weighty.<ref name=NP/><ref name=Swaan/>\n\nA further development was the flying buttress which arched externally from the springing of the vault across the roof of the aisle to a large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line of the external wall. These piers were often surmounted by a [[pinnacle]] or [[statue]], further adding to the downward weight, and counteracting the outward thrust of the vault and buttress arch as well as stress from wind loading.\n\nThe internal columns of the arcade with their attached shafts, the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses, with their associated vertical buttresses jutting at right-angles to the building, created a stone skeleton. Between these parts, the walls and the infill of the vaults could be of lighter construction. Between the narrow buttresses, the walls could be opened up into large windows.<ref name=BF/>\n\nThrough the Gothic period, thanks to the versatility of the pointed arch, the structure of Gothic windows developed from simple openings to immensely rich and decorative sculptural designs. The windows were very often filled with [[stained glass]] which added a dimension of colour to the light within the building, as well as providing a medium for figurative and narrative art.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Light\n | image1    =  Flying buttresses of Notre-Dame de Strasbourg.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Large clerestory windows between flying buttresses at Strasbourg\n | image2    = Lyon 5 - Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean 03.jpg\n | width2    = 185\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall windows lighting the vault at [[Lyon Cathedral]], made possible by flying buttresses\n | image3    = Chapter House, Wells Cathedral 9 (9317650737).jpg\n | width3    = 185\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Windows in a polygonal arrangement, Lady Chapel, Wells Cathedral\n | image4    = Rouen (24748511178).jpg \n | width4    = 185\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Tall windows in the aisle at Rouen, with additional windows in the triforium   \n | image5    = York Minster, York (14047415195).jpg\n | width5    = 185\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = \"Heart of Yorkshire\" window at York Minster, the scale of most west windows in England. \n | image6    = Paris 2019 (31878003887).jpg\n | width6    = 185\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The array of glass between thin stone mullions, [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris\n }}\n\n===Evolving styles===\nThe way in which the pointed arch was drafted and utilised developed throughout the Gothic period. There were fairly clear stages of development, which did not, however, progress at the same rate, or in the same way in every country. Moreover, the names used to define various periods or styles within Gothic architecture differs from country to country.\n\n====Lancet arch====\n\nSee also [[Lancet window]]. The simplest shape is the long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. Lancet openings are often grouped, usually as a cluster of three or five. Lancet openings may be very narrow and steeply pointed. Lancet arches are typically defined as two-centred arches whose radii are larger than the arch's span.<ref name=ching1>{{cite book|last=Ching|first=Francis D.K.|title=A Visual Dictionary of Architecture|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-64885-8|edition=2nd|page=6}}</ref>\n\n[[Salisbury Cathedral]] is famous for the beauty and simplicity of its Lancet Gothic, known in England as the Early English Style. [[York Minster]] has a group of lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient glass. They are known as the Five Sisters. These simple undecorated grouped windows are found at Chartres and [[Laon Cathedral]]s and are used extensively in [[Gothic architecture in Italy|Italy]].<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\n[[File:YorkMinsterChapterHouse.jpg|thumb|left|Windows in the Chapter House at [[York Minster]] show the equilateral arch with typical circular motifs in the tracery.]]\n\n====Equilateral arch====\n[[File:Equlateral arch.PNG|thumb|right|Equilateral Arch]]\nMany Gothic openings are based upon the [[Equilateral triangle|equilateral]] form. In other words, when the arch is drafted, the [[radius]] is exactly the width of the opening and the centre of each arch coincides with the point from which the opposite arch springs. This makes the arch higher in relation to its width than a semi-circular arch which is exactly half as high as it is wide.<ref name=BF/>\n\nThe Equilateral Arch gives a wide opening of satisfying proportion useful for doorways, decorative arcades and large windows.\n\nThe structural beauty of the Gothic arch means, however, that no set proportion had to be rigidly maintained. The Equilateral Arch was employed as a useful tool, not as a principle of design. This meant that narrower or wider arches were introduced into a building plan wherever necessity dictated. In the architecture of some Italian cities, notably [[Venice]], semi-circular arches are interspersed with pointed ones.<ref name=\"Ref_h\">This does not happen in French or English Gothic and so to the British or French eye, to be a strange disregard for style.</ref>\n\nThe Equilateral Arch lends itself to filling with tracery of simple equilateral, circular and semi-circular forms. The type of tracery that evolved to fill these spaces is known in England as Geometric Decorated Gothic and can be seen to splendid effect at many English and French Cathedrals, notably Lincoln and Notre Dame in Paris. Windows of complex design and of three or more ''lights'' or vertical sections, are often designed by overlapping two or more equilateral arches.<ref name=CT/>\n\n====Flamboyant arch====\n[[File:Limoges curvilinear tracery.JPG|thumb|[[Flamboyant]] tracery at [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges Cathedral]].]]\nThe [[Flamboyant]] Arch is one that is drafted from four points, the upper part of each main arc turning upwards into a smaller arc and meeting at a sharp, flame-like point. These arches create a rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface decoration. The form is structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within a larger and more stable arch. It is not employed at all for [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]].<ref name=BF/>\n\nSome of the most beautiful and famous traceried windows of Europe employ this type of tracery. It can be seen at [[St Stephen's Vienna]], [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, at the Cathedrals of [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges]] and [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]] in France. In England the most famous examples are the West Window of [[York Minster]] with its design based on the [[Sacred Heart]], the extraordinarily rich nine-light East Window at [[Carlisle Cathedral]] and the exquisite East window of [[Selby Abbey]].<ref name=CT/><ref name=NP/>\n\nDoorways surmounted by Flamboyant mouldings are very common in both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture in France. They are much rarer in England. A notable example is the doorway to the Chapter Room at [[Rochester Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\nThe style was much used in England for wall arcading and niches. Prime examples in are in the Lady Chapel at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], the Screen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and externally on the fa\u00e7ade of [[Exeter Cathedral]]. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture it often appears as openwork screens on the exterior of buildings. The style was used to rich and sometimes extraordinary effect in both these countries, notably on the famous pulpit in [[Vienna Cathedral]].<ref name=JH1/>\n\n[[File:F\u00e4chergew\u00f6lbe KingsCollege.jpg|thumb|left|The depressed arch supported by fan [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] at [[King's College Chapel]], England.]]\n\n====Depressed arch====\nThe depressed or [[four-centred arch]] is much wider than its height and gives the visual effect of having been flattened under pressure. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small [[radius]] and then turn into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point.<ref name=BF/>\n\nThis type of arch, when employed as a window opening, lends itself to very wide spaces, provided it is adequately supported by many narrow vertical shafts. These are often further braced by horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface.\n\nThe style, known as [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]], that evolved from this treatment is specific to England, although very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular, and was employed to great effect through the 15th century and first half of the 16th as Renaissance styles were much slower to arrive in England than in Italy and France.<ref name=BF/>\n\nIt can be seen notably at the East End of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] where the East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court. There are three very famous royal chapels and one chapel-like Abbey which show the style at its most elaborate: [[King's College Chapel]], [[Cambridge]]; [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]]; [[Henry VII's Chapel]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[Bath Abbey]].<ref name=CT/> However very many simpler buildings, especially churches built during the wool boom in [[East Anglia]], are fine examples of the style.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = \n | image1    = \n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = \n | image2    = \n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = \n | image3    = \n | width3    = 160\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = \n | image4    = \n | width4    = 160\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  =   \n | image5    = \n | width5    = 160\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = \n | image6    = \n | width6    = 160\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = \n | image7    = \n | width7    = 160\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = \n | image8    = \n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  =  \n }}\n\n\n<!---\n\n==Elements of Gothic style==\n===Plan===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Plan.cathedrale.Chartres.png|Plan of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1194\u20131220)\nFile:YorkMinsterPlanDehio vert.jpg|Plan of [[York Minster]]\nFile:Cathedral schematic plan en vectorial.svg|Plan of a Gothic Cathedral\nFile:Plan.cathedrale.Cologne.png|Plan of [[Cologne Cathedral]]\nFile:Coupe.nef.eglise.Saint.Denis.png|Cross section of the nave wall and buttresses of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]\n</gallery>\n\nThe plan of the Gothic cathedral was based on the model of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was a combined public market and courthouse; which was also the basis of the plan of the Romanesque cathedral. The cathedral is in the form of a [[Latin cross]]. The entrance is traditionally on the west end, has three portals decorated with sculpture, usually a rose window, and is flanked by two towers. The long nave, where the congregation worshipped, occupies the west end. This is usually divided from the nave by rows of pillars, which support the roof, flanked by one or two [[aisle]]s, called ''[[:fr:Collat\u00e9ral (architecture)|collat\u00e9raux]]''. There are usually small chapels on the two sides, placed between the buttresses, which provide additional support to the walls.\n\nThe cathedral usually has a [[transept]], a crossing, roughly in the middle, which sometimes projects outwards some distance, and in other cases, such as Notre-Dame, is minimal. The ''crois\u00e9e'' or crossing of the transept, is the centre of the church, and is surrounded by particularly massive pillars, which sometimes support a [[lantern tower]], which brings light into the centre of the cathedral. The north and south facades of the transept often feature rose windows, as at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].\n\nTo the east of the transept is the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], where the altar is located, where ceremonies take place, and where only the clergy is allowed. This space grew greatly in the 12th century, as ceremonies became more elaborate. Behind the choir is a single or double walkway called ambulatory. At the eastern end of the church is the [[apse]], usually in the form of a half-circle, and the chevet. There is usually a chapel here dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which can be very large. Around the chevet there are usually several other smaller chapels.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic cathedrals had four levels, from the floor to the roof. On the ground floor, there were two rows grand arcades with large pillars, which received the weight of the vaults of the ceiling. Above these were the tribunes, a section of arched openings, giving more support. Above these was the [[triforium]], a section of small arches. On the top level, just below the vaults, were the upper windows, the main source of light for the cathedral. The lower walls were supported by massive ''contreforts'' or buttresses placed directly up against them, with pinnacles on top which provided additional weight. Later, with the development of the flying buttress, the supports moved further away from the walls, and the walls were built much higher. Gradually, the tribunes and the triforium disappeared, and the walls above the arcades were occupied almost entirely with stained glass.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=33}}\n\nThe eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In England it is generally long and may have two distinct sections, both choir and [[Chancel|presbytery]]. It is often square ended or has a projecting [[Lady chapel]] dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]]. In France, the eastern end is often polygonal and surrounded by a walkway called an ambulatory and sometimes a ring of chapels called a [[chevet]]. While German churches are often similar to those of France, in Italy, the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually just a shallow [[Apse chapel|apsidal chapel]] containing the sanctuary, as at [[Florence Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/><ref name=Swaan>Wim Swaan, ''The Gothic Cathedral''</ref>    --->\n\n===Stained glass windows===\n{{see also|Gothic tracery}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitraux Saint-Denis 190110 19.jpg|[[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], Abbot [[Suger]] represented at feet of Virgin Mary (12th century)\nFile:Chartres_RosetteSued_122_DSC08269.jpg|South transept rose window of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1221\u20131230)\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Bourges - D\u00e9tail du vitrail de l'Apocalypse (d\u00e9but XIII\u00e8me si\u00e8cle).JPG|Detail of the Apocalypse window, [[Bourges Cathedral]], early 13th century\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral, south Oculus (37582928966).jpg|South [[Oculus]] of [[Canterbury Cathedral]].

Historians including [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}\n\nReligious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine. When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], he instructed that the windows in the choir admit as much light as possible.\n\nMany earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref name=Swaan/>\n\nThe main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of coloured glass were joined together with pieces of lead, and then their surfaces were painted with faces and other details. and then the windows were mounted in the stone frames. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass.\n\nThe stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the [[Bible]], but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\nMuch of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\n===Portals and the tympanum===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Saint Denis PM 086190 F.jpg|North portal of [[Basilica of St Denis]], with early [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] and columns made of elongated figures (1135\u20131140)\nFile:Amiens cathedral Tympanumt.JPG|Day of Judgement [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] at [[Amiens Cathedral]] (1220\u20131270), the prototype for other high Gothic portals.\nFile:Frontispice cath\u00e9drale Strasbourg.JPG|Portals and tympanum of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] (Begun 1176)\nFile:WestminsterNorth55.jpg|[[Westminster Abbey]] north portal (begun 1245)\n</gallery>\n\nEarly Gothic Cathedrals traditionally have their main entrance at the western end of the church, opposite the choir. Based on the model of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], there are usually three doorways with pointed arches, richly filled with sculpture. The [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], or arch, over each doorway is filled with realistic statues illustrating biblical stories, and the columns between the doors are often also crowded with statuary. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe iconography of the sculptural decoration on the facade was not left to the artists. An edict of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 had set the rules: \"The composition of religious images is not to be left to the inspiration of artists; it is derived from the principles put in place by the Catholic Church and religious tradition. Only the art belongs to the artist; the composition belongs to the Fathers.\"{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=79}}\n\nThe portals and interiors were much more colourful than they are today. Each sculpture on the tympanum and in the interior was painted by the ''peintre imagier'', or image painter, following a system of colours codified in the 12th century; yellow, called ''gold'', symbolized intelligence, grandeur and virtue; white, called ''argent'', symbolized purity, wisdom, and correctness; black, or ''sable'', meant sadness, but also will; green, or ''sinople'', represented hope, liberty and joy; red or ''gueules'' (see [[gules]]) meant charity or victory; blue or ''azure'' symbolized the sky, faithfulness and perseverance; and violet, or ''pourpre'', was the colour of royalty and sovereignty.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=54}}\n\n===Sculpture and decoration===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chartres2006 076.jpg|Statues of Saints are literally \"pillars of the church\", supporting the portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]].\nFile:Paris - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame - Portail de la Vierge - PA00086250 - 003.jpg|The martyr Saint [[Denis]], holding his head, over the Portal of the Virgin ([[Notre-Dame de Paris]])\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris - Portail du Jugement dernier - d\u00e9tail 01.jpg|The serpent tempts Adam and Eve; part of the [[Last Judgement]] on the central portal of west facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:DevilCentralGateNotreDameParis.jpg|[[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] and Satan weighing souls during the [[Last Judgement]] ([[Notre-Dame de Paris]] central portal, west facade)\nFile:Chimera of Notre-Dame de Paris, 26 April 2014.jpg|A [[strix (mythology)|stryge]] on west facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Notre-Dame Rzygacze.JPG|[[Gargoyles]] were the rainspouts of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Gargoyle Point of View (3575829233).jpg|[[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] on [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] west facade\nFile:H\u00f4tel de ville de Bruxelles - Gargouille 01.JPG|[[Gargoyle]] on [[Brussels Town Hall]]\nFile:Gargoyles and Saints - Siena Cathedral.jpg|Gargoyle on [[Siena Cathedral]] (13th century)\nFile:Labyrinthchartres.jpg|[[Labyrinth]] at [[Chartres Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\n\nThe exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read. They were described as \"Books for the poor.\" To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the facades was originally painted and gilded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e9ne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture Fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6. (Project Gutenburg).</ref>\n\nEach feature of the Cathedral had a symbolic meaning. The main portals at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[Last Judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as \"the pillars of the church.\"{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}} Each Saint had his own symbol: a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]], an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpets, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate their function at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the [[Garden of Eden]]; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}}\n\nThe [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The strix appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.<ref name=fasti>Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131\u2013,{{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.</ref> They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshippers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nThe [[gargoyle]]s, which were added to Notre-Dame in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]]. They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]] during the 19th-century restoration. Similar figures appear on the other Gothic cathedrals of France.\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n==French Gothic==\n{{Main|French Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFranceNormandieCoutancesCathNotreDameFacade.jpg|[[Coutances Cathedral]] in Normandy (1210\u20131274)\nP1240007 Bayeux cathedrale ND rwk.jpg|[[Bayeux Cathedral]] in Normandy (1180\u20131350)\nNef de la cath\u00e9drale d'Auxerre.jpg|Interior of [[Auxerre Cathedral]] in Burgundy (1215\u20131233)\nAlbi Sainte-C\u00e9cile.JPG|[[Albi Cathedral]], originally begun as a fortress, in Southwest France (1282\u20131480)\nNave of the Ste C\u00e9cile Cathedral - 2014-02-22.jpg|Polychrome interior of [[Albi Cathedral]] (1282\u20131480)\nFile:Fa\u00e7ade de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Toulouse.jpg|[[Toulouse Cathedral]] (13th century)\nPalmier des Jacobins.JPG|The Palm Tree of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]], 28 meters high ([[Toulouse]], 1292)\n</gallery>\n\nFrom the 12th century onwards, the Gothic style spread from Northern France to other regions of France and gradually to the rest of the Europe. It was often carried by the highly skilled craftsmen who had trained in the Ile-de-France and then carried their crafts to other cities. The style was adapted to local styles and materials.\n\nIn [[Normandy]], the new naves were usually very long, sometimes more than one hundred meters, and, from the long Romanesque tradition, the walls were thicker than in northern France, and had shorter buttresses. The interiors were narrower than in the north, and were given a strong sense of verticality by long and narrow bays and lancet arches. Rose windows were rare, replaced on the exterior by a large bay in ''tiers point''. The facades had less sculptural decoration; decoration in the interior was largely in geometric forms. Norman Gothic also usually featured a profusion of towers, lanterns and [[spire]]s; spires and [[Fl\u00e8che|spirelets]] sometimes were seventy meters high. [[Bayeux Cathedral]], [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Coutances Cathedral]] are notable examples of Norman Gothic.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n\nIn [[Burgundy]], which had a long [[Romanesque style]] tradition, a [[lantern tower]] was often included, and cathedrals often had a narrow passage the length of the cathedral at the level of the stained glass windows. as in [[Auxerre Cathedral]].\n\nIn the Southwest of France, the walls were thicker, with narrow openings, and doubled with arches. The flying buttress was rarely used, replaced by heavy [[abutment]]s with chapels between.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n\nThe south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. The Gothic cathedrals were often built with brick and tile rather than stone. They generally had thick walls and narrow windows, and were braced by heavy abutments rather than flying buttresses. The form of the tower of [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|the basilica of Saint-Sernin]] was copied by several cathedrals in the south, while the old nave of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] (1210\u20131220) gave the model of the single nave which was generally used in Southern French Gothic architecture (although some churches had two or three naves of equal height). Some Gothic cathedrals in the [[Southern France|Midi]] took unusual form; the [[Cathedral of Albi]] (1282\u20131480) was originally built as fortress, then converted to a cathedral. Albi Cathedral has another very distinctive feature; a colourful interior and painted ceiling.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}} In the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]] of [[Toulouse]], the grafting of a single apse of polygonal plan on a church with two vessels gave birth to a starry vault whose complex organization anticipated more than a century on the Flamboyant Gothic. Tradition refers to this masterpiece as \"palm tree\", because the veins gush out of the smooth shaft of the column-like palm trees.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1337/ | title=Episcopal City of Albi}}</ref>\n\nThe facade of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] is unusual; it is the combination of two unfinished cathedral buildings, begun in the 13th century and finally put together. Toulouse Cathedral has no flying buttresses; it is supported by massive ''contreforts'' the height of the building, with chapels between.\n\n==English Gothic==\n{{Main|English Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir 2, Kent, UK - Diliff.jpg|12th century choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] ([[Early English Gothic]])\nFile:Salisbury Cathedral Choir, Wiltshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|Choir of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220\u20131258) ([[Early English Gothic]])\nFile:YorkMinsterWest.jpg|West front of [[York Minster]] ([[Decorated Gothic]])\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|[[Gloucester Cathedral]] ([[Perpendicular Gothic]]) (1351\u20131377)\nFile:Westminster abbey16.jpg|Fan vaults with pendants at the [[Henry VII Chapel]] of [[Westminster Abbey]] ([[Perpendicular Gothic]]) (1503)\n</gallery>\n\nThe Gothic style was imported very early into England, in part due to the close connection with the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which until 1204 was still ruled by the Kings of England. The first period is generally called [[early English Gothic]], and was dominant from about 1180 to 1275. The first part of major English cathedral to feature the new style was the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], begun about 1175. It was created by a French master builder, [[William of Sens]]. He added several original touches, including coloured marble pavement, double columns in the arcades, and engaged slender ''colonettes'' which reached up to the vaults, borrowed from the design of [[Laon Cathedral]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=34\u201335}} [[Westminster Abbey]] was rebuilt from 1245 to 1517. [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220\u20131320) is also a good example of early Gothic, with the exception of its tower and spire, which were added in 1320.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe second period of English Gothic is known as [[Decorated Gothic]]. It is customarily divided into two the \"Geometric\" style (1250\u201390) and the \"Curvilinear\" style (1290\u20131350), and it is similar to the French [[Rayonnant]] style, with an emphasis on curvilinear forms, particularly in the windows. This period saw detailed stone carving reach its peak, with elaborately carved windows and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], often with floral patterns, or with an accolade, a carved arch over a window decorated with pinnacles and a [[fleuron (architecture)|fleuron]], or carved floral element.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe rib vaults of the Decorated Gothic became extremely ornate, with a profusion of ribs that were purely ornamental. The vaults were often decorated with hanging stone pendants. The columns also became more ornamental, as at Peterborough Cathedral, with ribs spreading upward.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380\u20131520) was the final phase of English Gothic, lasting into the 16th century. As the name suggests, its emphasis was on clear horizontal and vertical lines, meeting at right angles. Columns extended upwards all the way to the roof, giving the interior the appearance of a cage of glass and stone, as in the nave of [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The [[Tudor Arch|Tudor arch]] appeared, wider and lower and often framed by [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]], which was used to create larger windows and to balance the strong vertical elements. The design of the rib vaults became even more complex, including the [[fan vault]] with pendants used in the Henry VII chapel at [[Westminster Abbey]] (1503\u201307).{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\nA distinctive characteristic of English cathedrals is their extreme length, and their internal emphasis upon the horizontal, which may be emphasised visually as much or more than the vertical lines. Each English cathedral (with the exception of Salisbury) has an extraordinary degree of stylistic diversity, when compared with most French, German and Italian cathedrals. It is not unusual for every part of the building to have been built in a different century and in a different style, with no attempt at creating a stylistic unity. Unlike French cathedrals, English cathedrals sprawl across their sites, with double transepts projecting strongly and [[Lady chapel]]s tacked on at a later date, such as at Westminster Abbey. In the west front, the doors are not as significant as in France, the usual congregational entrance being through a side porch. The West window is very large and never a rose, which are reserved for the transept gables. The west front may have two towers like a French cathedral, or none. There is nearly always a tower at the crossing and it may be very large and surmounted by a spire. The distinctive English east end is square, but it may take a completely different form. Both internally and externally, the stonework is often richly decorated with carvings, particularly the capitals.<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\n==Northern European Gothic==\n{{See also|Architecture of Germany|Brabantine Gothic|Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic architecture in Lithuania|Polish Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Kdom.jpg|Rear of [[Cologne Cathedral]], [[Cologne]], [[Germany]] (1248\u20131473)\nFile:Matthias Church Budapest Corrected.jpg|[[Matthias Church]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (11th\u201315th centuries)\nFile:Saint Wenceslas Chapel, St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague 20160809 1.jpg|St. Wenceslas Chapel in [[St. Vitus Cathedral|Prague Cathedral]], [[Czech Republic]] (1356\u20131367)\nFile:Wien - Stephansdom (1).JPG|[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]], [[Austria]] (1339\u20131365)\nFile:20110917 Krakow Kosciol Mariacki 0306.jpg|[[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]] (1290\u20131365)\nFile:Haarlem bavo inside.jpg|[[Brabantine Gothic]] [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem]] in [[Netherlands]] (c. 1479)\n</gallery>\n\nBetween the 13th and 16th centuries, Gothic cathedrals were constructed in most of the major cities of northern Europe. For the most part, they followed the French model, but with variations depending upon local traditions and the materials available. The first Gothic churches in Germany were built from about 1230. They included [[Liebfrauenkirche, Trier|Liebfrauenkirche]] ( ca. 1233\u20131283) in [[Trier]], claimed to be the oldest Gothic church in Germany,<ref>{{Cite web|author=UNESCO|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/367|title=UNESCO Cultural Heritage Sites; Liebfrukirche, Trier}}</ref> and [[Freiburg Cathedral]], which was built in three stages, the first beginning in 1120, though only the foundations of the original cathedral still exist. It is noted for its 116-metre tower, the only Gothic church tower in Germany that was completed in the Middle Ages (1330).\n\n[[Prague]], in the region of [[Bohemia]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was another flourishing centre for Gothic architecture. [[Charles IV of Bohemia]] was both King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, and he had monumental tastes. He began construction of Prague's [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in the Gothic style in 1344, as well as a Gothic palace, [[Karl\u0161tejn|Karlstein Castle]] in Central Bohemia, and Gothic buildings for the new [[Charles University|University of Prague]]. The nave of [[Prague Cathedral]] featured the filet vault, a decorative type of vault in which the ribs criss-crossed in a mesh pattern, similar to the vaults of [[Bristol Cathedral]] and other English churches. His other Gothic projects included the lavishly decorated Chapel of the Holy Cross inside [[Karl\u0161tejn|Karlstein Castle]] (1357\u20131367), and the choir of [[Aachen Cathedral]] begun in 1355, which was built on the model of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=221\u2013230}} Gothic architecture in Germany and the kingdoms of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] generally followed the French formula, but the towers were much taller and, if completed, were often surmounted by enormous openwork spires. The distinctive character of the interior of German Gothic cathedrals is their breadth and openness. German and Czech cathedrals, like the French, tend not to have strongly projecting transepts. There are also many [[hall church]]es (''Hallenkirchen'') without [[clerestory]] windows.<ref name=BF/><ref name=Swaan /> [[Cologne Cathedral]] is after [[Milan Cathedral]] the largest Gothic cathedral in the world.

Another regional variation is the [[Brabantine Gothic]] a style found in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is characterized by using light-coloured [[sandstone]] or limestone, which allowed rich detailing but was prone to erosion. Features included columns with sculpted cabbage-like foliage, arched windows whose points came right up into the vaults. and, sometimes, a wooden ceiling. Examples include [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem]], in [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands, originally built as a Catholic cathedral, now a Protestant church, and the [[Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon]] in Brussels (15th century).\n\n==Southern European Gothic==\n===Spain and Portugal===\n{{Main|Spanish Gothic architecture|Portuguese Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Catedral G\u00f3tica de Le\u00f3n.jpg|[[Le\u00f3n Cathedral]] (1205\u20131472)\nFile:KathedraleToledo.jpg|[[Toledo Cathedral]] (1227\u20131493)\nFile:Fachada de la Catedral de Burgos.jpg|[[Burgos Cathedral]] (1221\u20131260)\nFile:Catedral_de_Valencia,_Valencia,_Espa%C3%B1a,_2014-06-29,_DD_16.JPG|[[Valencia Cathedral]] (13th\u201315 c.)\nFile:Sevilla Cathedral - Southeast.jpg|[[Seville Cathedral]]\nFile:Karinecyril evora cathedrale2.JPG|[[Evora Cathedral]], [[\u00c9vora]], Portugal (1280\u20131340)\nFile:Evora53.jpg|Gothic nave of [[\u00c9vora Cathedral]], Portugal, leads to a [[Baroque]] chapel (1280\u20131340)\n</gallery>\n\nStrikingly different variations of the Gothic style appeared in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Important examples of Spanish Gothic include [[Toledo Cathedral]], [[Le\u00f3n Cathedral]], and [[Burgos Cathedral]].\nThe distinctive characteristic of Gothic cathedrals of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is their spatial complexity, with many areas of different shapes leading from each other. They are comparatively wide, and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories, giving a similar spacious appearance to the ''Hallenkirche'' of Germany, as at the Church of the [[Batalha Monastery]] in Portugal. Many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels. Like English cathedrals, each is often stylistically diverse. This expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources. Among the influences on both decoration and form are [[Islamic architecture]] and, towards the end of the period, Renaissance details combined with the Gothic in a distinctive manner. The West front, as at Leon Cathedral, typically resembles a French west front, but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces. At [[Burgos Cathedral]] there are spires of German style. The roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles. There are often towers and domes of a great variety of shapes and structural invention rising above the roof.<ref name=BF/> [[Church of San Pablo, Valladolid|Church of San Pablo]] in [[Valladolid]] is an outstanding example of construction that combines the [[Isabelline Gothic]] style (a local adaptation of the Gothic style) with the [[Renaissance architecture]].<!---DO NOT CHANGE. READ DISCUSSION PAGE--->\n\nIn the territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]] (Aragon, Catalonia, [[Roussillon]] in France, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Valencian Community]], among others in the Italian islands), the Gothic style suppressed the transept and made the [[Aisle#Church architecture|side-aisles]] almost as high as the main nave, creating wider spaces, and with few ornaments. There are two different Gothic styles in the Aragonese lands: [[Catalan Gothic]] and [[Valencian Gothic]], which are different from those in the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and France.\n\nThe most important samples of Catalan Gothic style are the cathedrals of [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], [[Perpignan]] and [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] (in [[Mallorca]]), the basilica of [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]] (in Barcelona), the [[Santa Maria del Pi, Barcelona|Bas\u00edlica del Pi]] (in Barcelona), and the church of [[Santa Maria, Manresa|Santa Maria de l'Alba]] in [[Manresa]].\n\nThe most important examples of Valencian Gothic style in the old [[Kingdom of Valencia]] are the [[Valencia Cathedral]], [[Llotja de la Seda]] (Unesco World Heritage site), [[Torres de Serranos]], Torres de Quart, [[Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba]], in [[Alfauir]], [[Palace of the Borgias]] in [[Gandia]], [[Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de la Valldigna]], [[Basilica of Santa Maria, Alicante|Basilica of Santa Maria]], in [[Alicante]], [[Orihuela Cathedral]], [[Castell\u00f3 Cathedral]] and [[El Fadr\u00ed]], [[Segorbe Cathedral]], etc.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Italian Gothic architecture|Venetian Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Duomo di Siena, April 2017.jpg|[[Siena Cathedral]] (1215\u20131263)\nFile:Toscana Siena4 tango7174.jpg|Interior of [[Siena Cathedral]] (1215\u20131263)\nFile:Facciata del Duomo di Orvieto.JPG|[[Orvieto Cathedral]] (1290\u20131591)\nFile:Interno duomo Orvieto.jpg|Nave of [[Orvieto Cathedral]] (begun 1290)\nFile:Fa\u00e7ade cath\u00e9drale Florence.jpg|[[Florence Cathedral]] (1296\u20131436)\nFile:GPisano-PulpitoPisa background blurred.JPG|Pulpit of [[Pisa Cathedral]], by [[Giovanni Pisano]] (1302\u20131310)\nFile:Toscana Pisa11 tango7174.jpg|[[Santa Maria della Spina]] (about 1323)\nFile:Milan Cathedral from Piazza del Duomo.jpg|[[Milan Cathedral]] (1386\u20131510 \u2013 facade from 19th century)\nFile:Photograph of of the Doges Palace in Venice.jpg|[[Doges Palace]] (1424\u20131442)\n</gallery>\n\n[[Italian Gothic architecture]] went its own particular way, departing from the French model. It was influenced by other styles, notably the [[Byzantine style]] introduced in [[Ravenna]]. Major examples include [[Milan Cathedral]], the [[Orvieto Cathedral]], and particularly [[Florence Cathedral]], before the addition of the Duomo in the Renaissance.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe Italian style was influenced by the materials available in the different regions; [[marble]] was available in great quantities in [[Tuscany]], and was lavishly used in churches; it was scarce in [[Lombardy]], and brick was used instead. But many of the architectural elements were used apparently mainly to be different from the French style.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=147}}\n\nThe [[Cistercian]] monastic order introduced some of the first Gothic churches into Italy, in [[Fossanova Abbey]] (consecrated 1208) and the [[Casamari Abbey]] (1203\u20131217). They followed the basic plan of the Gothic Cistercian churches of [[Burgundy]], particularly [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=148}}\n\nThe Italian plan is usually regular and symmetrical, Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns. The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated, based on the square and the concept of \"''armon\u00eca''\", and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches, the arches are almost always equilateral. Italian Gothic cathedrals often retained Romanesque features; the nave of [[Orvieto Cathedral]] had Romanesque arches and vaults.\n\nItalian cathedrals also offered a variety of plans; Florence Cathedral (begun 1246) had a rectangular choir, based on the Cistercian model, but was designed to have three wings with polygonal chapels. Italian Gothic cathedrals were generally not as tall as those in France; they rarely used flying buttresses, and generally had only two levels, an arcade and a ''claire-voie'' with small windows; but [[Bologna Cathedral]] (begun in 1388), rivalled [[Bourges Cathedral]] in France in height. The smallest notable Italian Gothic church is [[Santa Maria della Spina]] in [[Pisa]] (about 1330), which resembles a Gothic jewel box.{{sfn|Martindale|1993|p=148}}\n\nA distinctive characteristic of Italian Gothic is the use of polychrome decoration, both externally as marble veneer on the brick fa\u00e7ade and internally where the arches are often made of alternating black and white segments. The columns were sometimes painted red, and the walls were decorated with frescoes and the apse with mosaic. Italian cathedral fa\u00e7ades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors. The fa\u00e7ades have projecting open porches and ocular or wheel windows rather than roses, and do not usually have a tower. The crossing is usually surmounted by a dome. There is often a free-standing tower and baptistery. The eastern end usually has an apse of comparatively low projection. The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and, although stained glass windows are often found, the favourite narrative medium for the interior is the [[fresco]].<ref name=BF/> The facade of Orvieto Cathedral, begun in 1310, is a striking example of mosaic decoration. Another innovation of Italian Gothic is the bronze doorway covered with sculpture; the most famous examples are the doors of the [[Florence Baptistery]] by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330\u20131336).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=161\u2013175}}\n\nItalian Gothic cathedrals did not have the elaborate sculptural tympanums over the entrances of French cathedrals, but they had abundant realistic sculptural decoration. Some of the finest work was done by [[Nicola Pisano]] at the [[Pisa Baptistery]] (1259\u201360) and in [[Siena Cathedral]], and by his son [[Giovanni Pisano]] on the west facade of [[Pisa Cathedral]] (1284\u201385).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=152\u2013176}}\n\n==Gothic in the Colonial Americas==\n{{See also|Mendicant monasteries in Mexico}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Bas\u00edlica Menor de Santa Mar\u00eda CCSD 07 2017 4676.jpg|[[Basilica Cathedral of Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor]] (1514-1541) in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic<ref name=\"whc.unesco.org\"/><ref name=\"5albemarleway.co.uk\"/>\nFile:SacristyCathedralDF.JPG|A Gothic vault in the sacristy of the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]] (started to built in 1573)<ref name=\"catedralmetropolitanademexico.mx\"/>\nFile:Palacio de Cort\u00e9s 2017.jpg|[[Palace of Cort\u00e9s, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cort\u00e9s]] (1523-1528) in Cuernavaca, Mexico, this palace has a style that blends Gothic and [[Mud\u00e9jar art|Mud\u00e9jar]]<ref name=\"Routledge\"/><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\nFile:20090405-182346- eglise du couvent saint gabriel -modifi\u00e9e-.jpg|[[San Gabriel Franciscan Convent, Cholula|San Gabriel Franciscan Convent]] in [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]], Metropolitan area of Puebla City, Mexico, it is partially Gothic (built in the mid-16th century)<ref name=\"lonelyplanet.com/mexico\"/><ref name=\"inafed.gob.mx\"/>\nFile:Templo y convento de San Mateo Ap\u00f3stol.JPG|[[Earliest 16th-century monasteries on the slopes of Popocat\u00e9petl|Convent of San Mateo Ap\u00f3stol y Evangelista]] (1535-1567)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rosademaria.wordpress.com/2016/10/05/ex-convento-agustino/|title=Ex Convento Agustino|website=rosademaria.wordpress.com|date = 5 October 2016|language = Spanish}}</ref> in [[Atlatlahucan]], Mexico, is a late-Gothic [[Plateresque]] church that is a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]<ref name=\"list/702\"/>\n</gallery>\nThere are late-Gothic architecture from the era in some of the oldest Christian churches built in the Americas.

Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.\nThe Rouen Courthouse in Normandy is representative of Flamboyant Gothic in France.\n\nIn the 15th century, following the late Gothic or flamboyant period, elements of Gothic decoration borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in the town halls of northern France, in Flanders and in the Netherlands. The H\u00f4tel de Ville of [[Compi\u00e8gne]] has an imposing gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate [[Accolade (architecture)|accolades]] or ornamental arches.

The Gothic style was adapted from English monasteries for use in the first colleges of [[Oxford University]], including [[Magdalen College]]. It was also used at the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain. The use of the late Gothic style at Oxford and [[Cambridge University]] inspired the picturesque Gothic architecture in U.S. colleges in the 19th and 20th century.\n\nBy the late Middle Ages university towns had grown in wealth and importance as well, and this was reflected in the buildings of some of Europe's ancient universities. Particularly remarkable examples still standing nowadays include the [[Collegio di Spagna]] in the [[University of Bologna]], built during the 14th and 15th centuries; the [[Karolinum|Collegium Carolinum]] of the [[Charles University in Prague]] in Bohemia; the [[University of Salamanca|Escuelas mayores]] of the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain; the chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge]]; or the [[Collegium Maius]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland.\n\n==Military architecture==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chateau-de-Vincennes-donjon.jpg|Donjon of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]], begun 1337\nCarcasonneouterwall.jpg|Restored outer walls of the medieval city of [[Carcassonne]] (13th\u201314th century)\nFile:Chateau.Louvre.png|The Louvre in the time of [[Charles V of France]] (1338\u20131380) drawn by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]\nFile:2012.05.12 MALBORK (4).JPG|[[Malbork Castle]] in Poland (13th century)\nFile:Exterior Alcazar Segovia.jpg|[[Alcazar of Segovia]] (12th\u201313th centuries)\nFile:Burg Hohenzollern.JPG|[[Hohenzollern Castle]] (1454\u20131461) in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], southern Germany\n</gallery>\n\nIn the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]]. The new kind of fortification was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the centre, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nCastles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers. One good surviving example is the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), pg. 38</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337\u20131453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants; the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls. The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=38}}\n\n==Decline==\nBeginning in the 16th century, as [[Renaissance architecture]] from Italy began to appear in France and other countries in Europe, the dominance of Gothic architecture began to wane. Nonetheless, new Gothic buildings, particularly churches, continued to be built; new Gothic churches built in Paris in this period included [[Saint-Merri]] (1520\u20131552); and [[Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois]]; The first signs of classicism in Paris churches, at [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]], did not appear until 1540. The largest new church, [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] (1532\u20131560), rivalled Notre-Dame in size, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide, and 35 meters high. As construction of this church continued, elements of Renaissance decoration, including the system of classical orders of columns, were added to the design, making it an early Gothic-Renaissance hybrid.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pp=24\u201326}}\n\nThe Gothic style began to be described as outdated, ugly and even barbaric. The term \"Gothic\" was first used as a [[pejorative]] description. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term \"barbarous German style\" in his 1550 ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style.{{sfn|Vasari|1991|pp=117, 527}} In the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributed various architectural features to \"[[Goths|the Goths]]\" whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered [[Rome]], and erecting new ones in this style.{{sfn|Vasari|Brown|Maclehose|1907|p=83}} In the 17th century, [[Moli\u00e8re]] also mocked the Gothic style in the 1669 poem ''La Gloire'': \"...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...\"{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=9}} The dominant styles in Europe became in turn [[Italian Renaissance architecture]], [[Baroque architecture]], and the grand classicism of the [[Louis XIV style]].\n\nNonetheless, Gothic architecture, usually churches or university buildings, continued to be built. Ireland was an island of Gothic architecture in the 17th and 18th centuries, with the construction of [[St Columb's Cathedral|Derry Cathedral]] (completed 1633), [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Sligo|Sligo Cathedral]] (c. 1730), and [[Down Cathedral]] (1790\u20131818) are other notable examples.<ref>{{cite web|first =Bob|last = Hunter |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/plantation/transcripts/pa01_t06.shtml |title =Londonderry Cathedtral| publisher = BBC|website =Wars & Conflict: The Plantation of Ulster|date = 18 September 2014}}</ref> In the 17th and 18th century several important Gothic buildings were constructed at [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]], including [[Tom Tower]] at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], by [[Christopher Wren]] (1681\u201382) It also appeared, in a whimsical fashion, in [[Horace Walpole]]'s [[Twickenham]] [[villa]], [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill]] (1749\u20131776) The two western towers of [[Westminster Abbey]] were constructed between 1722 and 1745 by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], opening a new period of [[Gothic Revival]].\n\n==Survival, rediscovery and revival==\n{{main|Gothic Revival architecture}}\n\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Big Ben 1 2012-07-03.jpg|[[Big Ben|Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben)]] (completed in 1859) and the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London (1840\u20131876)\n\n</gallery>\n\nIn England, partly in response to a philosophy propounded by the [[Oxford Movement]] and others associated with the emerging revival of 'high church' or [[Anglo-Catholic]] ideas during the second quarter of the 19th century, neo-Gothic began to become promoted by influential establishment figures as the preferred style for ecclesiastical, civic and institutional architecture. The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass \"low church\" as well as \"high church\" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855\u20131885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].\n\nThe [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.\n\nThe middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of medieval architecture turned to technical consideration. London's Palace of Westminster, St. Pancras railway station, New York's Trinity Church and St. Patrick's Cathedral are also famous examples of Gothic Revival buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gothic-architecture|title=Gothic Architecture and Churches {{!}} Architectural Digest|website=Architectural Digest|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> Such style also reached the [[Far East]] in the period, for instance, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[St. John's Cathedral (Hong Kong)|St. John's Cathedral]] which was located at the centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]] in [[Central, Hong Kong]].\n<!--- Need to read this through \n==Influences==\n\n===Romanesque and Norman influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Durham Cathedral.

The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based upon the plan of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was adopted by Romanesque architecture. The [[Latin cross]] form, with a [[nave]] and transept, choir, disambulatory, and radiating chapels, came from the Romanesque model. The grand arcades of columns separating the central vessel of the [[nave]] from the collateral aisles, the [[triforium]] over the grand arcades, and the windows high on the walls allowing light into the nave were all also adapted from the Romanesque model. The portal with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] filled with sculpture was another characteristic Romanesque feature, as was the use of the buttress to support the walls from the outside. Gothic architects improved them by adding the [[flying buttress]] with high arches connecting the buttresses to the upper walls. In the interior, Romanesque architecture used the [[barrel vault]] with a round arch to cover the nave, and a [[groin vault]] when two barrel vaults met at right angles. These vaults were the immediate ancestors of the Gothic rib vault. The first use of the Gothic rib vaults to cover a nave was in the Romanesque [[Durham Cathedral]], (1093\u20131104).<ref name=\"auto\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2018), pp. 35-37</ref>\n\n[[Norman Architecture]], similar to the Romanesque style, also influenced the Gothic style. Early examples are found in [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy, which also featured early rib vaults in the nave similar to the Gothic vaults. [[Cefalu Cathedral]] (1131\u20131267) in Sicily, built when Sicily was under Norman rule, is another interesting example. It featured pointed arches and large Romanesque vaults combined with ornamental mosaic decoration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nRomanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto L\u00f3pez, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}} \n\n===Islamic and Armenian influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortess.jpg|[[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] (completed 775 AD), Iraq\nJerusalem-2013-Al-Aqsa Mosque 04.jpg|[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], Jerusalem\nCordoba, la Mezquita - C\u00fapula de la Maqsura.jpg|Vaulted central dome of [[Cordoba Cathedral|Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral]], Spain (784\u2013987 A.D.).

It begins to appear throughout the Islamic world in close succession after its adoption in the late Umayyad or early Abbasid period. Some examples are the [[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress|Al-Ukhaidir Palace]] (775 AD), the Abbasid reconstruction of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|Al-Aqsa mosque]] in 780 AD, the [[White Mosque, Ramla|Ramlah Cisterns]] (789 AD), the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] (851 AD), and the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] (879 AD) in Cairo. It also appears in one of the early reconstructions of the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, and the Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba in 987 AD. The pointed arch had already been used in Syria, but in the mosque of Ibn Tulun we have one of the earliest examples of its use on an extensive scale, some centuries before it was exploited in the West by the Gothic architects.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Islamic Art|last=Rice|first=David T.|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=1979|isbn=9780500201503|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islamicartworldo00davi/page/45 45]|url=https://archive.org/details/islamicartworldo00davi/page/45}}</ref>\n\nA kind of [[rib vault]] was also used in Islamic architecture, for example in the ceiling of the [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]]. In Cordoba, the dome was supported by [[pendentives]], which connected the dome to the arches below. The pendentives were decorated with ribs. Unlike the Gothic rib vault, the Islamic ribs were purely decorative; they did not extend outside of the vault, and they were not part of the structure supporting the roof. \n\nThe military and [[Islamic world contributions to Medieval Europe|cultural contacts with]] the [[medieval Islamic world]], including the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest]] of [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Islamic Sicily]] in 1090, the [[Crusades]] (beginning 1096), and the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic presence in Spain]], may have influenced [[Medieval Europe]]'s adoption of the pointed arch.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Bony|1983|p=17}} Another feature of Gothic architecture, a kind of rib vault, had also earlier appeared in Islamic architecture, and spread to Western Europe via [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]].<ref name=\"Bloom\"/><ref name=Giese-Vogeli>{{cite book|last=Giese-V\u00f6geli|first=Francine|title=Das islamische Rippengew\u00f6lbe : Ursprung, Form, Verbreitung |trans-title=Islamic rib vaults: Origins, form, spread|date=2007|publisher=Gebr.

The dome of the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba was supported by pendentives, rather than the vault. These were frequently used in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Byzantine architecture]], as in the dome of [[Hagia Sophia]] in Istanbul, which also was supported by pendentives. The Gothic rib vault, among other features, such as the flying buttress, have their antecedents in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] architecture, such as [[Durham Cathedral]], constructed between 1093 and 1096.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Mignon|2015|p=10}}\n\nIn those parts of the [[Western Mediterranean]] subject to Islamic control or influence, rich regional variants arose, fusing Romanesque and later Gothic traditions with [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] decorative forms.

It is based on [[Linux|GNU/Linux]] operating system and runs on Ubuntu 16.04.  In addition to various web conferencing services, it has integrations for many of the major learning and content management systems.\n\n== Features ==\nBigBlueButton supports multiple audio and video sharing, presentations with extended whiteboard capabilities - such as a pointer, zooming and drawing - public and private chat, desktop sharing, integrated VoIP using [[FreeSWITCH]], and support for presentation of PDF documents and Microsoft Office documents. Moreover, users may enter the conference in one of two roles: viewer or moderator.\n\nAs a viewer, a user may join the voice conference, share their webcam, raise their hand, and chat with others. As a moderator, a user may mute/unmute others, eject any user from the session, and make any user the current presenter. The presenter may upload slides and control the presentation.<ref name=\"bigbluebuttonorg\">{{ cite web\n |url         = http://bigbluebutton.org/overview\n |title       = BigBlueButton Overview\n |accessdate  = 2010-10-23\n |publisher   = bigbluebutton.org\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101025230435/http://bigbluebutton.org/overview\n |archivedate = 2010-10-25\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nThe BigBlueButton server runs on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit and can be installed either from source code or from Ubuntu packages.
