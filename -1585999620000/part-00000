Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by Lee Hall, development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning $109.3 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes on Avon Street were used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=|195x195px]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids. And there's a series of themes in it I rather enjoyed: Grief; finding means of self-identification through some sort of creative act, in this case dance; and the miner's strike itself.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|title=Interview: Stephen Daldry Dances to Success with \"Billy Elliot\"|last=Indiewire|last2=Indiewire|date=2000-10-17|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102200205/https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|archive-date=2 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Working Title Films]] approached Daldry to become director and he accepted the offer.

(playwright)|Lee Hall]]. Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by Lee Hall, development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning $109.3 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes on Avon Street were used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=|195x195px]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids. And there's a series of themes in it I rather enjoyed: Grief; finding means of self-identification through some sort of creative act, in this case dance; and the miner's strike itself.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|title=Interview: Stephen Daldry Dances to Success with \"Billy Elliot\"|last=Indiewire|last2=Indiewire|date=2000-10-17|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102200205/https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|archive-date=2 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Working Title Films]] approached Daldry to become director and he accepted the offer.

In essence their propositions concerning the properties of quadrangles which they considered assuming that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse, embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines \u2013 made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the 13th century, while revising Ibn al-Haytham's ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') \u2013 was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the 14th century by the Jewish scholar [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gerson]], who lived in southern France, and by the above-mentioned Alfonso from Spain directly border on Ibn al-Haytham's demonstration.

Large-format medallions appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier \"kufic\" border design was replaced by tendrils and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]]. All these patterns required a more elaborate system of weaving, as compared to weaving straight, rectilinear lines. Likewise, they require artists to create the design, weavers to execute them on the loom, and an efficient way to communicate the artist's ideas to the weaver. Today this is achieved by a template, termed cartoon (Ford, 1981, p.&nbsp;170<ref name=\"Ford, Oriental Carpet Design\">{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames & Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|edition=1st}}</ref>).

In essence their propositions concerning the properties of quadrangles which they considered assuming that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse, embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines \u2013 made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the 13th century, while revising Ibn al-Haytham's ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') \u2013 was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the 14th century by the Jewish scholar [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gerson]], who lived in southern France, and by the above-mentioned Alfonso from Spain directly border on Ibn al-Haytham's demonstration.

The idea of using hours of equal time length throughout the year was the innovation of [[Ibn al-Shatir|Abu'l-Hasan Ibn al-Shatir]] in 1371, based on earlier developments in [[trigonometry]] by [[Muhammad ibn J\u0101bir al-Harr\u0101n\u012b al-Batt\u0101n\u012b]] (Albategni).

Large-format medallions appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier \"kufic\" border design was replaced by tendrils and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]]. All these patterns required a more elaborate system of weaving, as compared to weaving straight, rectilinear lines. Likewise, they require artists to create the design, weavers to execute them on the loom, and an efficient way to communicate the artist's ideas to the weaver. Today this is achieved by a template, termed cartoon (Ford, 1981, p.&nbsp;170<ref name=\"Ford, Oriental Carpet Design\">{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames & Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|edition=1st}}</ref>).
