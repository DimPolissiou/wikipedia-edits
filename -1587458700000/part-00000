He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[New York Yankees]] from 1955 through 1966. Batting and throwing right-handed, he formed a top double play combination with fellow Yankee [[infielder]]s [[Clete Boyer]] and [[Tony Kubek]]. In 1962, he led the [[American League]] (AL) in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] with 209 and snared a [[line drive]] off the bat of [[Willie McCovey]] to win the [[1962 World Series]] for the Yankees. He is the only [[World Series MVP Award|World Series Most Valuable Player]] ever to be selected from the losing team.\n\nBorn in [[Sumter, South Carolina]], Richardson grew up desiring to play for the Yankees after seeing the 1942 film ''[[Pride of the Yankees]]''. Drawing interest from 11 out of 16 MLB teams, he signed with the Yankees and made his debut for them two years later. Earning a regular spot on the roster in 1957, Richardson reached his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] that year, though it was not until 1959 that he would become a regular at second base. In 1960, he was named the World Series MVP. Though the Yankees lost the Series in seven games to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], Richardson [[Batting average|batted]] .367 with 12 [[runs batted in]] (RBI). He won the next two World Series, ending the 1962 series by catching McCovey's line drive in what ''[[The Sporting News]]'' called baseball's 13th most memorable play. Richardson led the AL in hits that year, with 209.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1965, Richardson won five straight [[Gold Glove Award]]s at second base. He played in the All-Star Game every year from 1962 through 1966. In 1963, he won the [[Lou Gehrig Memorial Award]], and he played in the World Series in 1963 and 1964. His last two years in the major leagues, he had 164 and 153 hits, respectively. Though only 31 after the 1966 season, Richardson retired to spend more time with his family. The Yankees held a special day for him towards the end of the season, making Richardson the 10th Yankee to be so honored.\n\nAfter his playing career, Richardson [[Coach (baseball)|coached]] college teams for several years. He led the [[University of South Carolina]] to its first [[College World Series]] in 1975 and laid the groundwork for their later success. In 1986, he led [[Coastal Carolina University]]'s baseball team to a [[Big South Conference]] championship, and he coached at [[Liberty University]] from 1987 through 1990. Richardson ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[South Carolina's 5th congressional district]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in 1976 but lost to incumbent [[Kenneth Lamar Holland|Kenneth Holland]]. A [[born-again Christian]], Richardson was involved in many Christian organizations during and after his career. He spoke at the [[White House]] in 1970 as a representative of the [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]], appeared in five [[Billy Graham Crusade]]s, and frequently speaks at churches and other organizations.\n\n==Early life==\nRichardson was the middle child of Robert Sr. and Debbie Richardson of [[Sumter, South Carolina]]. He had two sisters, Inez (older) and Willie Ann (younger).<ref name=\"SABR\"/> Richardson Marble and Granite Works in Sumter was managed by Robert Sr., who also owned some of the interest in the company.<ref name=\"Richardson's father\">{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/06/18/80711961.html?pageNumber=37|title=Bobby Richardson's Father, 57|work=The New York Times|date=June 18, 1963|accessdate=April 10, 2020|page=37}}</ref>\n\nEver since seeing ''[[Pride of the Yankees]]'', released in 1942, Richardson had dreamed of playing for the [[New York Yankees]]. Growing up, he practiced his baseball skills with Harry Stokes, a boy in his neighborhood seven years his senior who would play catch with him. Richardson played on a local [[YMCA]]/[[Salvation Army]] team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local [[Kiwanis Club]] and [[American Legion]]. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was [[Fred Hutchinson]], who would later manage the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when Richardson faced them in the [[1961 World Series]]. Hutchinson and Richardson became American Legion champions in 1952, Richardson's junior year of high school. Hutchinson also coached Richardson at Edmunds High School.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\n11 out of 16 [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams showed interest in Richardson, as well as the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Georgia Tech University]], which offered baseball scholarships. [[Mayo Smith]], manager of the [[Norfolk Tars]], a team in the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Piedmont League]] and an affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]], scouted Richardson for New York, as did Bill Harris. Ultimately, Richardson decided to forgo college and sign with the Yankees out of high school (though he later earned a degree in accounting).<ref name=\"SABR\"/><ref name=\"Sunday Conversation\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===1953-56: Playing in the minor leagues, debuting with the Yankees===\nRichardson started his [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] career in 1953 with the [[Norfolk Tars]] of the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Piedmont League]], travelling by bus to Norfolk from Sumter with $85 in coins friends and family had given him.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Pasculli|first=Len|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/47363efd|title=Bobby Richardson|work=SABR|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> After Richardson [[Batting average|batted]] just .211 in his first 27 games with the Tars, the Yankees assigned him to a [[Class D (baseball)|Class D]] team, the [[Olean Yankees]] of the [[New York\u2013Penn League|PONY League]].<ref name=\"SABR\"/><ref name=\"minors\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=richar007rob|title=Bobby Richardson Minor League Statistics & History|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> With Olean, he batted .412 in 32 games and hit his first [[home run]].<ref name=\"minors\"/>\n\nIn 1954, Richardson was promoted, heading up to the [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[Binghamton Triplets]] of the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] without having to return to Norfolk.

He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[New York Yankees]] from 1955 through 1966. Batting and throwing right-handed, he formed a top double play combination with fellow Yankee [[infielder]]s [[Clete Boyer]] and [[Tony Kubek]]. In 1962, he led the [[American League]] (AL) in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] with 209 and snared a [[line drive]] off the bat of [[Willie McCovey]] to win the [[1962 World Series]] for the Yankees. He is the only [[World Series MVP Award|World Series Most Valuable Player]] ever to be selected from the losing team.\n\nBorn in [[Sumter, South Carolina]], Richardson grew up desiring to play for the Yankees after seeing the 1942 film ''[[Pride of the Yankees]]''. Drawing interest from 11 out of 16 MLB teams, he signed with the Yankees and made his debut for them two years later. Earning a regular spot on the roster in 1957, Richardson reached his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] that year, though it was not until 1959 that he would become a regular at second base. In 1960, he was named the World Series MVP. Though the Yankees lost the Series in seven games to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], Richardson [[Batting average|batted]] .367 with 12 [[runs batted in]] (RBI). He won the next two World Series, ending the 1962 series by catching McCovey's line drive in what ''[[The Sporting News]]'' called baseball's 13th most memorable play. Richardson led the AL in hits that year, with 209.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1965, Richardson won five straight [[Gold Glove Award]]s at second base. He played in the All-Star Game every year from 1962 through 1966. In 1963, he won the [[Lou Gehrig Memorial Award]], and he played in the World Series in 1963 and 1964. His last two years in the major leagues, he had 164 and 153 hits, respectively. Though only 31 after the 1966 season, Richardson retired to spend more time with his family. The Yankees held a special day for him towards the end of the season, making Richardson the 10th Yankee to be so honored.\n\nAfter his playing career, Richardson [[Coach (baseball)|coached]] college teams for several years. He led the [[University of South Carolina]] to its first [[College World Series]] in 1975 and laid the groundwork for their later success. In 1986, he led [[Coastal Carolina University]]'s baseball team to a [[Big South Conference]] championship, and he coached at [[Liberty University]] from 1987 through 1990. Richardson ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[South Carolina's 5th congressional district]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in 1976 but lost to incumbent [[Kenneth Lamar Holland|Kenneth Holland]]. A [[born-again Christian]], Richardson was involved in many Christian organizations during and after his career.

Richardson played on a local [[YMCA]]/[[Salvation Army]] team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local [[Kiwanis Club]] and [[American Legion]]. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was [[Fred Hutchinson]], who would later manage the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when Richardson faced them in the [[1961 World Series]].

His father, Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Thu\u1eadt, was a [[Han Nom]] teacher.\n\nThe third born of seven siblings, Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Th\u00e1i was dedicated to studying and graduated from a French-Vietnamese colonial elementary school, however, he dropped out of school at the age of 13 because of financial difficulties; '''Xi\u00eam''' had to work as a barber. At the age of 15, he was influenced by a Communist movement.\n\nAt the age 18, Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Th\u00e1i worked in a mine in [[H\u1ed3ng Gai]] in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Province]], he attended movements against the unfairness of the mine owners and returned to his hometown in 1936.\n\nIn 1938 he joined the [[Communist Party of Indochina]]. Trailed by the colonial authorities, he fled to the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] in 1941. There, he was educated at a military academy in Guilin. In 1944 he returned to [[Vietnam]] where he was employed for propaganda and intelligence purposes of the forming [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]]. In December 1945 he became Chief of Staff of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces. In 1948 he was promoted to major general. Hoang Van Thai was dismissed as Chief of Staff shortly before the beginning of the Battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7. His successor was [[Van Tien Dung]].<ref>Christopher E. Goscha : ''Historical Dictionary of the Indochina War (1945\u20131954)'', Kopenhagen, 2011, S. 216</ref>\n\nIn January 1948 Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Th\u00e1i was promoted to one of the first generals of Vietnam. On August 31, 1959, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. In 1966 he was assigned as Commander and Political Commissar to the Military Region V. From 1967 to 1973, when he was assigned to the south, he was commander of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army and the deputy COSVN. At the Battle of Loc Ninh he was Commanding Officer (27 October 1967 \u2013 10 December 1967), also during the [[Tet Offensive]] in January 1968. In April 1974 he was promoted to the rank of colonel general. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Defense, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff and permanent member of the Central Military Committee. In January 1980 he was promoted to general. He was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam and delegate of the 7th Party Congress. On July 2, 1986, he died suddenly after a heart attack in Army Hospital 108.\n\nHe opened a music class to organise young men to participate in rebellious activities. After few months, students were numbered to 170 members with himself as a secretary. Through experiences gained from secret activities, he spread leaflets on the sly in order to encourage people to get involved against high taxes, struggling for democratic freedom.\n\n== Early service in military ==\nIn 1941, [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] was founded, he became  a commander of the squad [[Vietnamese People's National Salvation Army|National Salvation Army]] [[B\u1eafc S\u01a1n District|B\u1eafc S\u01a1n]] ([[L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]]). Under the name of '''Quoc Binh''', meaning \"peaceful country\", several comrades and he left for military training in [[Liuzhou]], China.\n\nIn late 1943, he met with [[Ho Chi Minh]], then released by the [[Chiang Kai-shek]] government. After military school he returned to Vietnam with a new assumed name '''Hoang Van Thai''' (Thai stems from his hometown [[Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh Province|Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh]], also meaning \"peaceful\"), joined the resistance against Japan and then joined the [[August Revolution]] against France in 1945.  He also was one of 34 soldiers led by [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] that met on 22 December 1944 to found the Armed Propaganda Unit for National Liberation that later became the [[Vietnam People's Army]]. Thai was assigned to be in charge of propaganda and agitation of the newly organisation. \n[[File:Vietnam People's Army date establishment.gif|left|thumb|200px|The PAVN's establishment in 1944.

In the meantime, the Japanese led a coup d'\u00e9tat against the French authority. French units dispersed and fled to China later on. [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] cadres with the help of the PAVN quickly formed a new authority and established training. Thai, subsequently, took order from [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] to hand over the area to the local Vi\u1ec7t Minh cadres and continued to lead members down to [[Cho Chu]], [[Tuy\u00ean Quang]], supporting as well as training self-defence units and political cadre groups.\n\nIn April 1945, the Northern Military Meeting determined the merging of several groups, including the Vietnam People's Army, into the ''Vietnam Liberation Army''  (Vi\u1ec7t Nam Gi\u1ea3i Ph\u00f3ng Qu\u00e2n). Vietnam Liberation Army was considered as the main force of Vi\u1ec7t Minh. At the same time, the ''Political-Military Japanese Resistance school'' (Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Qu\u00e2n ch\u00ednh kh\u00e1ng Nh\u1eadt) was established in [[Tan Trao]]. Thai was assigned as the principal in charge of educating army staffs for the Vietnam Liberation Army.\n\n== The First Indochina War ==\nOn 7 September 1945, The President of the Provisional Government of Democratic Republic of Vietnam, [[Ho Chi Minh]] mandated the foundation of a [[General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army|General Staff]] and appointed Thai as the Chief of General Staff. Under this mandate,  Thai was assigned as the first Chief of General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army. (1945\u20131953), by President [[Ho Chi Minh]] of the [[Government of Vietnam|Provisional Government]] at the age of 30.\n\nOn 22 May 1946, the [[Vietnamese National Guard|National Guard]] was renamed as [[Vietnamese National Army]], officially becoming a regular army placed under the control of the [[General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army|General Staff]]. In the meantime, although [[Ho\u2013Sainteny agreement]] and Provisional 14 September agreement were signed and being active, but the French put pressure by force on the newly government to reattain [[French Indochina]]. As the Chief of General Staff of the Vietnamese National Army, Thai organised the army personnel and established armed forces as well as paramilitaries in countrysides and defence forces in cities. By the end of 1946, approximately 1 million militias were organised and trained in preparation for war while every diplomatic means failed.\n\nWhen French troops provoked in [[Hai Phong]], Thai directly commanded the front in Hai Phong from the 20th to 27th in November 1947. [[Vietnamese Nationwide Resistance]] broke out in [[Hanoi]], Thai and [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] were the ones that approved operational plans of the Hanoi front leader [[Vuong Thua Vu]]. The plans proposed a firm deployment restraining the French from moving forward as well as decreasing the number of French troops in the city within 2 months.\n\nAfter baffling the French attempt, on 26 August 1947, a major [[Division (military)|Division]] regarded as [[Independence Division]] was created. Chief of General Staff Hoang Van Thai was assigned as a commander. However, on 7 October, the French launched the [[Operation Lea]] attacking [[Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc]] base. Units that had been organised to form Division previously had to disperse into small fronts. Thai was assigned to play a role as the commander of the Route Coloniale 3 front. Eventually, the Operation Lea resulted in French limited success and Vietnamese strategic victory.\n\nIn January 1948, he was promoted as one of the first Generals of Vietnam, along with: [[General]] [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]], Lieutenant General [[Nguy\u1ec5n B\u00ecnh]], and [[Major General]]s: [[Nguyen Son]], [[Chu V\u0103n T\u1ea5n]], [[Hoang Sam]], [[Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a]], [[Le Hien Mai]], [[V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng]], [[Tr\u1ea7n T\u1eed B\u00ecnh]], [[Le Thiet Hung]], [[Duong Van Duong]] (died in 1946).\n\nIn 1950, he was Chief of Staff of [[Battle of Route Coloniale 4|Borders campaign]] and the Commanding Officer in the [[Battle of \u0110\u00f4ng Kh\u00ea]], which opened the campaign.\n\n=== Campaign in First Indochina War ===\nCampaigns that Thai participated in as the Chief of General Staff (with [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] playing the role of a commander) in the [[First Indochina War]]:\n# [[Operation Lea]], autumn-winter 1947.\n# [[Battle of Route Coloniale 4]], September\u2013October 1950.\n# [[Battle of V\u0129nh Y\u00ean]], December 1950.\n# [[Battle of Hoang Hoa Tham]], 1951.\n# [[Battle of H\u00e0 Nam Ninh]], May 1951.\n# [[Battle of H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh]], December 1951.\n# [[Battle of Northwest]], September 1952.\n# [[Battle of Upper Laos]], April 1953.\n# [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], March to May 1954.\n\n=== Battle of Dien Bien Phu ===\nIn 1953, Major General [[Van Tien Dung]], then Commander of [[320th Division (Vietnam)|320th Division]], was recalled to [[Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc]] to assume the [[General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army|Chief of General Staff]] position. Thai was assigned as Deputy Chief of General Staff. In fact, he was appointed as Special Campaign Chief of Staff [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7]], assistant to the Commander in Chief [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]].

The group began making operational plans in a bit later on. On 12 January 1954, V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p's group arrived.\n\nFollowing the victory of [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] in Dien Bien Phu, [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] was signed, ending 80 years of French presence in Vietnam.\n\n== In Vietnam War ==\n\nOn 31 August 1959, he was one of four people to be proposed for [[Colonel General]] rank, but he refused.

His father, Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Thu\u1eadt, was a [[Han Nom]] teacher. He had 7 siblings, he was the third child.\n\nHo\u00e0ng V\u0103n Th\u00e1i was dedicated to studying and graduated from a French-Vietnamese colonial elementary school, however, he dropped out of school at the age of 13 because of financial difficulties; '''Xi\u00eam''' had to work as a barber. At the age 15, he was influenced by a Communist movement.\n\nAt the age 18, Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Th\u00e1i worked in a mine in [[H\u1ed3ng Gai]] in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Province]], he attended movements against the unfairness of the mine owners and returned to his hometown in 1936.\n\nIn 1938 he joined the [[Communist Party of Indochina]]. Trailed by the colonial authorities, he fled to the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] in 1941. There, he was educated at a military academy in Guilin. In 1944 he returned to [[Vietnam]] where he was employed for propaganda and intelligence purposes of the forming [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]]. In December 1945 he became Chief of Staff of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces. In 1948 he was promoted to major general. Hoang Van Thai was dismissed as Chief of Staff shortly before the beginning of the Battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7. His successor was [[Van Tien Dung]].<ref>Christopher E. Goscha : ''Historical Dictionary of the Indochina War (1945\u20131954)'', Kopenhagen, 2011, S. 216</ref>\n\nIn January 1948 Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Th\u00e1i was promoted to one of the first generals of Vietnam. On August 31, 1959, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. In 1966 he was assigned as Commander and Political Commissar to the Military Region V. From 1967 to 1973, when he was assigned to the south, he was commander of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army and the deputy COSVN. At the Battle of Loc Ninh he was Commanding Officer (27 October 1967 \u2013 10 December 1967), also during the [[Tet Offensive]] in January 1968. In April 1974 he was promoted to the rank of colonel general. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Defense, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff and permanent member of the Central Military Committee. In January 1980 he was promoted to general. He was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam and delegate of the 7th Party Congress. On July 2, 1986, he died suddenly after a heart attack in Army Hospital 108.\n\nHe opened a music class to organise young men to participate in rebellious activities. After few months, students were numbered to 170 members with himself as a secretary. Through experiences gained from secret activities, he spread leaflets on the sly in order to encourage people to get involved against high taxes, struggling for democratic freedom.\n\n== Early service in military ==\nIn 1941, [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] was founded, he became  a commander of the squad [[Vietnamese People's National Salvation Army|National Salvation Army]] [[B\u1eafc S\u01a1n District|B\u1eafc S\u01a1n]] ([[L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]]). Under the name of '''Quoc Binh''', meaning \"peaceful country\", several comrades and he left for military training in [[Liuzhou]], China.\n\nIn late 1943, he met with [[Ho Chi Minh]], then released by the [[Chiang Kai-shek]] government. After military school he returned to Vietnam with a new assumed name '''Hoang Van Thai''' (Thai stems from his hometown [[Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh Province|Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh]], also meaning \"peaceful\"), joined the resistance against Japan and then joined the [[August Revolution]] against France in 1945.  He also was one of 34 soldiers led by [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] that met on 22 December 1944 to found the Armed Propaganda Unit for National Liberation that later became the [[Vietnam People's Army]]. Thai was assigned to be in charge of propaganda and agitation of the newly organisation. \n[[File:Vietnam People's Army date establishment.gif|left|thumb|200px|The PAVN's establishment in 1944.  Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Th\u00e1i wearing a pith helmet and holding the flag.]]\n\nIn March 1945, he commanded a group of 100 members to advance to [[Cho Don District]] to form a foundation in the area. In the meantime, the Japanese led a coup d'\u00e9tat against the French authority. French units dispersed and fled to China later on. [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] cadres with the help of the PAVN quickly formed a new authority and established training. Thai, subsequently, took order from [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] to hand over the area to the local Vi\u1ec7t Minh cadres and continued to lead members down to [[Cho Chu]], [[Tuy\u00ean Quang]], supporting as well as training self-defence units and political cadre groups.\n\nIn April 1945, the Northern Military Meeting determined the merging of several groups, including the Vietnam People's Army, into the ''Vietnam Liberation Army''  (Vi\u1ec7t Nam Gi\u1ea3i Ph\u00f3ng Qu\u00e2n). Vietnam Liberation Army was considered as the main force of Vi\u1ec7t Minh. At the same time, the ''Political-Military Japanese Resistance school'' (Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Qu\u00e2n ch\u00ednh kh\u00e1ng Nh\u1eadt) was established in [[Tan Trao]]. Thai was assigned as the principal in charge of educating army staffs for the Vietnam Liberation Army.\n\n== The First Indochina War ==\nOn 7 September 1945, The President of the Provisional Government of Democratic Republic of Vietnam, [[Ho Chi Minh]] mandated the foundation of a [[General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army|General Staff]] and appointed Thai as the Chief of General Staff. Under this mandate,  Thai was assigned as the first Chief of General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army. (1945\u20131953), by President [[Ho Chi Minh]] of the [[Government of Vietnam|Provisional Government]] at the age of 30.\n\nOn 22 May 1946, the [[Vietnamese National Guard|National Guard]] was renamed as [[Vietnamese National Army]], officially becoming a regular army placed under the control of the [[General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army|General Staff]]. In the meantime, although [[Ho\u2013Sainteny agreement]] and Provisional 14 September agreement were signed and being active, but the French put pressure by force on the newly government to reattain [[French Indochina]]. As the Chief of General Staff of the Vietnamese National Army, Thai organised the army personnel and established armed forces as well as paramilitaries in countrysides and defence forces in cities. By the end of 1946, approximately 1 million militias were organised and trained in preparation for war while every diplomatic means failed.\n\nWhen French troops provoked in [[Hai Phong]], Thai directly commanded the front in Hai Phong from the 20th to 27th in November 1947. [[Vietnamese Nationwide Resistance]] broke out in [[Hanoi]], Thai and [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] were the ones that approved operational plans of the Hanoi front leader [[Vuong Thua Vu]]. The plans proposed a firm deployment restraining the French from moving forward as well as decreasing the number of French troops in the city within 2 months.\n\nAfter baffling the French attempt, on 26 August 1947, a major [[Division (military)|Division]] regarded as [[Independence Division]] was created. Chief of General Staff Hoang Van Thai was assigned as a commander. However, on 7 October, the French launched the [[Operation Lea]] attacking [[Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc]] base. Units that had been organised to form Division previously had to disperse into small fronts. Thai was assigned to play a role as the commander of the Route Coloniale 3 front.

The group began making operational plans in a bit later on. On 12 January 1954, V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p's group arrived.\n\nFollowing the victory of [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] in Dien Bien Phu, [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] was signed, ending 80 years of French presence in Vietnam.\n\n== In Vietnam War ==\n\nOn 31 August 1959, he was one of four people to be proposed for [[Colonel General]] rank, but he refused. He eventually was promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant General]].\n\nIn 1960 to 1965, he held the position of chairman of the Committee for Physical Training and Sports of the Government, which was involved in military training.\n<ref>Ronald B.

CMLL had held the [[NWA World Welterweight Championship]] for over 53 years even after leaving the NWA in 1989. In 2010 the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], represented by [[Blue Demon Jr.]], the president of NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL telling them to stop promoting NWA-branded championships since CMLL was not part of the NWA any longer. On August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship belt and named Mephisto, the final CMLL-recognized NWA World Welterweight Champion, as the inaugural champion. The championship was initially announced as the CMLL Historic Welterweight Championship, but when the belt was unveiled, it was labelled the \"NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship\".\n\nIn Mexico, the ''lucha libre'' commission's definition of the [[Lucha Libre#Weight classes|welterweight weight class]] is between {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|78|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. [[Volador Jr.]] is the current NWA World Historic Welterweight Champion, having defeated [[Matt Taven]] on August 3, 2018. This is Volador Jr.'s third reign with the title; he is the ninth overall champion. Volador Jr.'s second reign was the longest of any NWA World Historic Welterweight Champion, 1,337 days. All title matches take place under [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|best two-out-of-three falls]] rules when they take place in Mexico, but has been defended in single [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Fall|fall]] matches in Japan.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mephisto CMLL.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mephisto (wrestler)|Mephisto]], the last [[NWA World Welterweight Championship|NWA World Welterweight Champion]]|alt=The masked wrestler Mephisto in the ring during a match.]]\nIn 1948 the Mexican ''[[lucha libre]]'' or [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL; Spanish for \"Mexican Wrestling Enterprise\") created the [[NWA World Welterweight Championship|World Welterweight Championship]].{{efn|name=NWAWelterBook|''Duncan & Will'' (2000) p. 390, Chapter name \"EMLL NWA Welterweight Title\"{{sfn|Duncan|Will|2000|p=390}}}} When EMLL became a member of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) in 1952 the championship was given the \"NWA\" prefix and became known as the NWA World Welterweight Championship. In the late 1980s, EMLL left the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) to avoid the politics of the NWA.{{efn|name=Alliance|''Hornbakker'' (2006) p 305: \"EMLL was a member of the NWA from 1952 to 1986, and Lutteroth controlled the Alliance world light heavyweight, middleweight and welterweight titles.\"{{sfn|Hornbaker|2006|p=305}}}} While they left the NWA they did retain control of the NWA World Welterweight Championship as their main championship of the [[Lucha libre#Weight classes|welterweight division]].

CMLL had held the [[NWA World Welterweight Championship]] for over 53 years even after leaving the NWA in 1989. In 2010 the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], represented by [[Blue Demon Jr.]], the president of NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL telling them to stop promoting NWA-branded championships since CMLL was not part of the NWA any longer. On August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship belt and named Mephisto, the final CMLL-recognized NWA World Welterweight Champion, as the inaugural champion. The championship was initially announced as the CMLL Historic Welterweight Championship, but when the belt was unveiled, it was labelled the \"NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship\".\n\nIn Mexico, the ''lucha libre'' commission's definition of the [[Lucha Libre#Weight classes|welterweight weight class]] is between {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|78|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. [[Volador Jr.]] is the current NWA World Historic Welterweight Champion, having defeated [[Matt Taven]] on August 3, 2018. This is Volador Jr.'s third reign with the title; he is the ninth overall champion. Volador Jr.'s second reign was the longest of any NWA World Historic Welterweight Champion, 1,337 days. All title matches take place under [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|best two-out-of-three falls]] rules when they take place in Mexico, but has been defended in single [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Fall|fall]] matches in Japan.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mephisto CMLL.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mephisto (wrestler)|Mephisto]], the last [[NWA World Welterweight Championship|NWA World Welterweight Champion]]|alt=The masked wrestler Mephisto in the ring during a match.]]\nIn 1948 the Mexican ''[[lucha libre]]'' or [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL; Spanish for \"Mexican Wrestling Enterprise\") created the [[NWA World Welterweight Championship|World Welterweight Championship]].{{efn|name=NWAWelterBook|''Duncan & Will'' (2000) p. 390, Chapter name \"EMLL NWA Welterweight Title\"{{sfn|Duncan|Will|2000|p=390}}}} When EMLL became a member of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) in 1952 the championship was given the \"NWA\" prefix and became known as the NWA World Welterweight Championship. In the late 1980s, EMLL left the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) to avoid the politics of the NWA.{{efn|name=Alliance|''Hornbakker'' (2006) p 305: \"EMLL was a member of the NWA from 1952 to 1986, and Lutteroth controlled the Alliance world light heavyweight, middleweight and welterweight titles.\"{{sfn|Hornbaker|2006|p=305}}}} While they left the NWA they did retain control of the NWA World Welterweight Championship as their main championship of the [[Lucha libre#Weight classes|welterweight division]]. They also promoted the [[Mexican National Welterweight Championship]] as a secondary title in the Welterweight division.{{efn|''Duncan & Will'' (2000) p. 392 chapter name \"Mexico: National Welterweight Title{{sfn|Duncan|Will|2000|p=392}}}} In 1992 EMLL changed their name and became known as ''Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre'' (CMLL; \"World Wrestling Council\") to rebrand themselves as a separate entity after leaving the NWA.{{efn|''Madigan'' \"in the late 1980s EMLL withdrew from the National Wrestling Alliance\"{{sfn|Madigan|2007|p=32}}}} They added a third welterweight championship to the promotion when they created the [[CMLL World Welterweight Championship]] on February 15, 1992.{{sfn|Duncan|Will|2000|p=396}}\n\nAfter the introduction of the CMLL championship, the then-reigning NWA World Welterweight Championship [[Misterioso (wrestler)|Misterioso]] left CMLL, vacating the championship.{{efn|''Duncan & Will'' (2000) p. 390 \"Vacant in 92/05 when Misterioso leaves EMLL.\"{{sfn|Duncan|Will|2000|p=390}}}} For the subsequent three years, CMLL did not promote the NWA World Welterweight Championship until bringing it back in the winter of 1995.

On 11 August 2008, he reached his highest [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] singles ranking of World No. 299, whilst his highest doubles ranking of World No. 32 was reached on 10 September 2018, after the US Open. He is the younger brother of [[Dmitri Sitak]], who was also a professional tennis player.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Artem Sitak's biography at ITF\n  | url = http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=30022504\n  | work = \n  | date = \n  | accessdate= 2011-01-09\n  }}</ref>\n\n==Tennis career==\n\n===Junior years===\nCoached during the 1990s by Santini, as a 13-year-old in 1999, Sitak received a wildcard into the main draw of an ITF junior tournament in Russia as a 13-year-old in 1999. He was defeated by Evgeni Smirnov 6\u20134, 6\u20131. The following year he entered the qualifying draw of the same tournament, and defeated future ATP top 50 player [[Denis Istomin]] 6\u20130, 6\u20131 to win his first ITF junior match. Sitak was taken out in the third and final round of qualifying by a future ATP top 100 player [[Teimuraz Gabashvili]] 6\u20134, 7\u20135.\n\nAt the age of 14, Sitak won the prestigious Orange Bowl.\n\nSitak made his first junior Grand Slam appearance at the age of 15 at the 2002 Australian Open where he was beaten in straight sets by Australian Christopher Roman. Sitak's last junior tournament came a year later at the 2003 Australian Open where he was eliminated by Korean Suk Hyun-Joon in the first round.\n\n===Senior career===\nSitak began his senior career in 2002 at a challenger event in Togliatti, Russia, where he received a wildcard into the main draw but fell in the first round to [[Thomas Blake (tennis)|Thomas Blake]], older brother of former top 10 player [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]]. Sitak's first title came in 2005 in a Russian futures tournament, where he defeated [[Pavel Chekhov (tennis)|Pavel Chekhov]] 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20134 in the final.\n\n===2011===\nSitak began 2011 under the New Zealand flag and received a wildcard into the [[2011 Heineken Open]] qualifying, where he was defeated by Frenchman Ludovic Walter 6\u20133, 6\u20134 in the first round.\n\n===2014 \u2013 first ATP Doubles title===\n\nSitak partnered Polish tennis player [[Mateusz Kowalczyk]] to win the [[Stuttgart Open|2014 MercedesCup]] doubles title, defeating [[Philipp Oswald]] and [[Guillermo Garcia-Lopez]] 2\u20136, 6\u20131, 10\u20137 in the final.\n\n===2017===\n\nSitak's long-running doubles partnership with [[Nicholas Monroe]] came to an end after [[2017 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Doubles|Wimbledon]] in 2017, and he subsequently teamed up with Dutch player [[Wesley Koolhof]].  They reached the final in Atlanta, losing to the Bryan brothers, and lost in the first round at the [[2017 US Open - Men's Doubles|US Open]] before winning a Challenger event in Szczecin, Poland, and losing another ATP final, this time in Metz, to [[Julien Benneteau]] and [[\u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin]].\n\n===2018===\n\nStarting the new year in [[2018 Brisbane International - Men's Doubles|Brisbane]], Sitak and Koolhof lost in the semi-finals to [[Leonardo Mayer]] and [[Horacio Zeballos]].  They lost in the first round in [[2018 ASB Classic - Men's Doubles|Auckland]] to [[Michael Venus (tennis)|Michael Venus]] and [[Raven Klaasen]], and then 7\u20136<sup>(5)</sup>, 4\u20136, 4\u20136 in the second round of the [[2018 Australian Open - Men's Doubles|Australian Open]] to the eventual winners, [[Oliver Marach]] and [[Mate Pavi\u0107]].  Although they were not in the original draw for the Mixed Doubles, Sitak and [[Olga Savchuk]] teamed up as alternates after an injury to [[Anastasia Rodionova]] in her women's doubles match meant that she and Marach could not participate.  They were beaten in a first-round match tie-break by [[Nadiia Kichenok]] and [[Marcel Granollers]].\n\nSitak and Koolhof then went to Newport Beach in California where, as top seeds, they lost in the first round, 2\u20136, 1\u20136, to [[Treat Huey]] and [[Denis Kudla]].  After that came the [[Davis Cup]] where, in [[Tianjin]], Sitak and [[Marcus Daniell]] lost their doubles tie to the lowly-ranked Chinese pair of [[Gong Mao-Xin]] and [[Zhang Ze]].  Sitak and Koolhof then lost in the quarter-finals at [[2018 Open Sud de France - Doubles|Montpellier]] before going all the way to the final in the [[2018 New York Open - Doubles|New York Open]], being beaten by [[Max Mirnyi]] and [[Philipp Oswald]] in a match tie-break.  They followed that up with a first round loss at [[2018 Delray Beach Open - Doubles|Delray Beach]] to [[Scott Lipsky]] and [[Divij Sharan]].\n\nTheir up and down season continued in Brazil, where they reached the final in [[2018 Brasil Open - Doubles|S\u00e3o Paulo]], but were beaten in straight sets by [[Federico Delbonis]] and [[M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez]].  Their next stop was Irving, Texas, where they lost in the semi-finals of the [[Irving Tennis Classic|ATP Challenger]] to [[Alexander Peya]] and [[Philipp Petzschner]].  Moving to Europe, and playing in the [[2018 JC Ferrero Challenger Open - Doubles|Alicante Challenger]] in Spain as preparation for the European clay court season, they won their second title together when they beat [[Guido Andreozzi]] and [[Ariel Behar]] 6\u20133, 6\u20132, in the final, but they lost in the first round of their next tournament in [[2018 Grand Prix Hassan II - Doubles|Marrakech]].  In the [[2018 Gazprom Hungarian Open - Doubles|Hungarian Open]] they beat the top seeds [[Nikola Mektic]] and [[Alexander Peya]] in the first round, but lost in the second to [[Marcin Matkowski]] and Sitak's former partner [[Nicholas Monroe]].\n\nTheir next tournament was at [[2018 Estoril Open - Doubles|Estoril]] where they went all the way to the final before losing to the British pair of [[Kyle Edmund]] and [[Cameron Norrie]], 2\u20136, 4\u20136.  They then lost in the first round of the [[2018 BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux|Bordeaux Challenger]] tournament after Sitak had been hit in the right ear by a smash from [[Radu Albot]], and also in the first round in [[2018 Geneva Open - Doubles|Geneva]], the last tournament before the French Open.\n\nAt [[2018 French Open - Men's Doubles|Roland Garros]], Sitak and Koolhof beat [[Andre Begemann]] and [[Antonio Sancic]] in the first round, then the ninth seeds [[Ivan Dodig]] and [[Rajeev Ram]], before going down to fifth seeds [[Juan Sebastian Cabal]] and [[Robert Farah (tennis)|Robert Farah]].  All three matches went to a deciding set.  After the tournament finished it was announced that the pair would split, with Koolhof joining Sitak's fellow New Zealander, and former partner, [[Marcus Daniell]], and Sitak linking up with Indian [[Divij Sharan]].<ref name=\"NZ Herald\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12064587|title= Big changes for Kiwi doubles players for grass court season|publisher=NZ Herald|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSitak and Sharan's first tournament together was at [[2018 Rosmalen Grass Court Championships - Men's Doubles|'s-Hertogenbosch]], where they were beaten in the semi-finals by [[Michael Venus (tennis)|Michael Venus]] and [[Raven Klaasen]].  They then lost in a big upset in the first round of qualifying at [[2018 Gerry Weber Open - Doubles|Halle]], before finding top seeds [[Juan Sebastian Cabal|Cabal]] and [[Robert Farah (tennis)|Farah]] their nemesis in the first round at [[2018 Eastbourne International - Men's Doubles|Eastbourne]].\n\nThey reached the quarter-finals at [[2018 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Doubles|Wimbledon]], the best-ever result in a Grand Slam tournament for either of them.  They had to come from two sets down in both their second and third round matches, against [[Julio Peralta]] and [[Horacio Zeballos]] and [[Marcin Matkowski]] and [[Jonathan Erlich]] respectively, before lining up against [[Mike Bryan]] and [[Jack Sock]] in the quarter-finals.  There were three tie-break sets to start, and just one loss of serve in the fourth set was enough to seal their defeat at the hands of the eventual champions.  In mixed doubles, Sitak teamed up with Ukrainian [[Lyudmyla Kichenok]] to beat Argentina's [[Leonardo Mayer]] and [[Maria Irigoyen]], but he withdrew from the second round due to fatigue from the length of the men's doubles matches.\n\nSitak teamed up with Erlich for the [[2018 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships - Doubles|Hall of Fame Championships]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], marching imperiously to the final, where they very quickly swept aside clay-court specialists [[Marcelo Arevalo]] and [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Reyes-Varela]].  Sitak maintained that it was their experience which counted - it was the 39th ATP final for Erlich, and the 11th for Sitak, but just the first for both their opponents.\n\nMoving on to Washington DC for the [[2018 Citi Open - Men's Doubles|Citi Open]], Sitak and Sharan beat [[James Cerretani|Jamie Cerretani]] and [[Leander Paes]] in the first round before losing to [[Jamie Murray]] and [[Bruno Soares]] in the quarter-finals.  Sitak then entered the [[2018 Rogers Cup - Men's Doubles|Toronto Masters]] with [[Stefanos Tsitsipas]], and received a first-round call up as an alternate for a withdrawn pair.  They ended up playing [[Michael Venus (tennis)|Michael Venus]] and [[Raven Klaasen]], and lost 6\u20134, 6\u20134.  Moving on to [[2018 Western & Southern Open - Men's Doubles|Cincinnati]] for the next Masters event, the pair qualified for direct acceptance.  In the first round they were drawn against [[Ivan Dodig]] and [[Robin Haase]], and lost in a match tie-break.\n\nIn his last tournament before the US Open, Sitak teamed up with [[Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi]] at [[2018 Winston-Salem Open - Doubles|Winston-Salem]].  They beat [[Max Mirnyi]] and [[Philipp Oswald]], then [[Marcelo Demoliner]] and [[Santiago Gonz\u00e1lez (tennis)|Santiago Gonzalez]], before falling to [[James Cerretani|Jamie Cerretani]] and [[Leander Paes]] in the semi-final.  In the [[2018 US Open - Men's Doubles|US Open]], Sitak and Sharan lost to eventual runners-up [[Lukasz Kubot]] and [[Marcelo Melo]] in the second round, while Sitak and [[Lyudmyla Kichenok]] were beaten in a tight first round battle in the [[2018 US Open - Mixed Doubles|mixed doubles]], losing 10\u20138 in the match tie-break to fourth seeds [[Latisha Chan]] and [[Ivan Dodig]].\n\nThe US Open was followed by New Zealand's [[Davis Cup]] tie against Korea in [[Gimcheon]], where Sitak and debutant [[Ajeet Rai]] were successful in their doubles rubber.  However, New Zealand lost the tie 3\u20132, and were relegated to Group II of the Asia/Oceania zone for the first time in five years.  Dashing back to France for what turned out to be just one match, Sitak, again with Qureshi, lost in the first round at [[2018 Moselle Open - Doubles|Metz]] to [[Oliver Marach]] and [[Jurgen Melzer]].  Reunited with Sharan a week later in China, they were upset in the first round of the [[2018 Chengdu Open - Doubles|Chengdu Open]] by [[Austin Krajicek]] and [[Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan]].\n\nIn the Japan Open they drew [[Jamie Murray]] and [[Bruno Soares]] in the first round, and lost in straight sets, and then were able to get into the [[2018 Shanghai Rolex Masters - Doubles|Shanghai Masters]] as an alternate entry, where they lost in the second round to Kubot and Melo, who went on to win the title.  Their next event was the [[2018 European Open - Doubles|European Open]] in Antwerp where, as fourth seeds, they lost to second seeds [[Nicolas Mahut]] and [[\u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin]] in an entertaining semi-final.\n\nFrom there they travelled to [[Basel]] for the [[2018 Swiss Indoors - Doubles|Swiss Indoors Open]], where they lost in an upset result in the semi-finals to [[Mischa Zverev|Mischa]] and [[Alexander Zverev]].  They finished their season at the [[2018 Rolex Paris Masters - Doubles|Paris Masters]] where, with only an hour's notice, they again took the court as an alternate.  They beat [[Feliciano Lopez|Feliciano]] and [[Marc Lopez]] in the first round, but lost in straight sets in the second round to the best team in the world for 2018, [[Mike Bryan]] and [[Jack Sock]].\n\n===2019===\nWith a new partner in the left-handed American [[Austin Krajicek]], Sitak began 2019 in [[2019 Brisbane International - Men's Doubles|Brisbane]], where they lost in the quarter-finals to [[Rajeev Ram]] and [[Joe Salisbury]].  They also lost in the quarter-finals in [[2019 ASB Classic - Men's Doubles|Auckland]], this time to [[Bob Bryan|Bob]] and [[Mike Bryan]], the former playing his first tournament since being injured in Monte Carlo and subsequently having surgery to replace his hip.\n\nThe [[2019 Australian Open - Men's Doubles|Australian Open]] also saw them record a win and a loss, beating [[Leander Paes]] and [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Reyes-Varela]] in the first round, but losing a tight match to eventual semi-finalists [[Ryan Harrison]] and [[Sam Querrey]] in the second, 6\u20134, 7\u20136<sup>(5)</sup>.  Sitak had another new partner in the mixed doubles, teaming up with former World doubles number one [[Ekaterina Makarova]].  Seeded eighth, they lost in the first round to [[Andreja Klepa\u010d]] and [[\u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin]].\n\nSitak and Krajicek then lost in the first round at [[2019 Open Sud de France - Doubles|Montpellier]] before going to [[2019 ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament - Doubles|Rotterdam]], where they got into the main draw as Lucky Losers, but again lost in the first round.  The same fate awaited them in [[2019 Rio Open - Doubles|Rio de Janeiro]], but they had far better luck in [[2019 Abierto Mexicano Telcel - Men's Doubles|Acapulco]], where they finished runners-up to [[Mischa Zverev|Mischa]] and [[Alexander Zverev]] after easily taking the first set of the final.  It was the first ATP500 series final for both Sitak and Krajicek.\n\nBecause of their relative rankings, Sitak found a new partner for [[2019 BNP Paribas Open - Men's Doubles|Indian Wells]] in singles specialist [[Nikoloz Basilashvili]], but they went out in the first round to eighth seeds [[Henri Kontinen]] and [[John Peers]].  That meant that he and Krajicek were able to go straight to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], where they had walk-overs in the first two rounds of the [[2019 Arizona Tennis Classic - Doubles|Phoenix Challenger]], beat [[James Cerretani|Jamie Cerretani]] and [[Nicholas Monroe]] in the semi-finals, and lost to [[Jamie Murray]] and [[Neal Skupski]] in the final.\n\nFrom there they went to [[2019 Miami Open - Men's Doubles|Miami]], where they lost in the first round, and on to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] for the [[2019 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships - Doubles|US Clay Court Championships]], where they lost to the Skupski brothers in the semi-finals.  That was followed by a loss in qualifying in [[2019 Barcelona Open Banco Sabadell - Doubles|Barcelona]] and a quarter-final loss in [[2019 BMW Open - Doubles|Munich]] before a first round loss in [[2019 Mutua Madrid Open - Men's Doubles|Madrid]], where they had got in as an alternate pair.\n\nThey also got into the [[2019 Italian Open - Men's Doubles|Italian Open]] as an alternate pair, and this time made it to the second round, losing to eventual champions [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal]] and [[Robert Farah (tennis)|Robert Farah]].  Another first round loss, this time as second seeds in [[2019 Geneva Open - Doubles|Geneva]], preceded their attempt at the [[2019 French Open - Men's Doubles|French Open]], where Krajicek dropped a bombshell just a couple of days before their first round match by announcing that he would be ending their partnership after this tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12235610|title= Tennis: Kiwi doubles ace Artem Sitak reveals partner's bombshell just before French Open|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=2019-05-19|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>.  Seeded 16th, the pair didn't have a single practice together before losing in the first round to [[Hsieh Cheng-peng]] and [[Christopher Rungkat]].  He and [[Makoto Ninomiya]] played [[2019 French Open - Mixed Doubles|mixed doubles]] together, but lost in a first round match tie-break to eventual semi-finalists [[Nadiia Kichenok]] and [[Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi]].\n\nSitak had different partners for each of his first three grass tournaments before winning the [[2019 Antalya Open - Doubles|Antalya Open]] with [[Jonathan Erlich]] in a week where the on-court temperatures seldom dropped below 40 degrees Celsius.  They defeated [[Ivan Dodig]] and [[Filip Pol\u00e1\u0161ek]] in straight sets in the final, having beaten French Open champions [[Kevin Krawietz]] and [[Andreas Mies]] in the first round.  At [[2019 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Doubles|Wimbledon]] Sitak and Erlich lost in the first round to [[M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez]] and [[Horacio Zeballos]], but Sitak went much further in the [[2019 Wimbledon Championships - Mixed Doubles|mixed doubles]].\n\nAlthough he and [[Laura Siegemund]] made it to the quarter-finals before losing to fifth seeds [[Kv\u011bta Peschke]] and [[Wesley Koolhof]], it's their first round match against [[Darija Jurak]] and [[Ken Skupski]] which will go down in history, the sprinklers facing Sitak and Siegemund bursting into life as they sat down with the score at 4-3 in the final set.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-06/wimbledon-sprinkler-soaks-players-at-doubles-match/11284844|title= Rogue sprinkler causes chaos at Wimbledon|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=2019-07-06|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>.  The match was eventually moved to another court to be finished.  As if that wasn't enough, their top quality third round match against third seeds [[Gabriela Dabrowski]] and [[Mate Pavi\u0107]] took three hours and 17 minutes, becoming the first mixed doubles match to require Wimbledon's innovation of a tie-break at 12-12 in the final set.\n\nSitak and Erlich were unable to defend their title in [[2019 Hall of Fame Open - Doubles|Newport]], losing in the first round, before Sitak teamed up with [[Radu Albot]] to reach the semi-finals in [[2019 BB&T Atlanta Open - Doubles|Atlanta]], but they lost in the first round in [[2019 Los Cabos Open - Doubles|Los Cabos]].  Next up was the [[2019 US Open - Men's Doubles|US Open]], where Sitak and [[Denys Molchanov]] lost in the first round to second seeds [[\u0141ukasz Kubot]] and [[Marcelo Melo]].  The same fate befell him in the [[2019 US Open - Mixed Doubles|mixed doubles]], where he and [[Lucie Hradeck\u00e1]] also lost in the first round.\n\nTwo more first round losses followed before Sitak reunited with [[Divij Sharan]].  Although losing their first match together, they reached the quarter-finals of the [[2019 Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships \u2013 Doubles|Japan Open]].  They made the [[2019 Rolex Paris Masters - Doubles|Paris Masters]] as alternates, beating Pavi\u0107 and [[Bruno Soares]] in the first round before losing to [[J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy]] and [[Fabrice Martin]] in the second.  Two first round losses in Challenger events ended the 2019 season for Sitak.\n\n==ATP career finals==\n===Doubles: 13 (5 titles, 8 runners-up)===\n{|\n|-

On 11 August 2008, he reached his highest [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] singles ranking of World No. 299, whilst his highest doubles ranking of World No. 32 was reached on 10 September 2018, after the US Open. He is the younger brother of [[Dmitri Sitak]], who was also a professional tennis player.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Artem Sitak's biography at ITF\n  | url = http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=30022504\n  | work = \n  | date = \n  | accessdate= 2011-01-09\n  }}</ref>\n\n==Tennis career==\n\n===Junior years===\nCoached during the 1990s by Santini, as a 13-year-old in 1999, Sitak received a wildcard into the main draw of an ITF junior tournament in Russia as a 13-year-old in 1999. He was defeated by Evgeni Smirnov 6\u20134, 6\u20131. The following year he entered the qualifying draw of the same tournament, and defeated future ATP top 50 player [[Denis Istomin]] 6\u20130, 6\u20131 to win his first ITF junior match. Sitak was taken out in the third and final round of qualifying by a future ATP top 100 player [[Teimuraz Gabashvili]] 6\u20134, 7\u20135.\n\nAt the age of 14, Sitak won the prestigious Orange Bowl.\n\nSitak made his first junior Grand Slam appearance at the age of 15 at the 2002 Australian Open where he was beaten in straight sets by Australian Christopher Roman. Sitak's last junior tournament came a year later at the 2003 Australian Open where he was eliminated by Korean Suk Hyun-Joon in the first round.\n\n===Senior career===\nSitak began his senior career in 2002 at a challenger event in Togliatti, Russia, where he received a wildcard into the main draw but fell in the first round to [[Thomas Blake (tennis)|Thomas Blake]], older brother of former top 10 player [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]]. Sitak's first title came in 2005 in a Russian futures tournament, where he defeated [[Pavel Chekhov (tennis)|Pavel Chekhov]] 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20134 in the final.\n\n===2011===\nSitak began 2011 under the New Zealand flag and received a wildcard into the [[2011 Heineken Open]] qualifying, where he was defeated by Frenchman Ludovic Walter 6\u20133, 6\u20134 in the first round.\n\n===2014 \u2013 first ATP Doubles title===\n\nSitak partnered Polish tennis player [[Mateusz Kowalczyk]] to win the [[Stuttgart Open|2014 MercedesCup]] doubles title, defeating [[Philipp Oswald]] and [[Guillermo Garcia-Lopez]] 2\u20136, 6\u20131, 10\u20137 in the final.\n\n===2017===\n\nSitak's long-running doubles partnership with [[Nicholas Monroe]] came to an end after [[2017 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Doubles|Wimbledon]] in 2017, and he subsequently teamed up with Dutch player [[Wesley Koolhof]].  They reached the final in Atlanta, losing to the Bryan brothers, and lost in the first round at the [[2017 US Open - Men's Doubles|US Open]] before winning a Challenger event in Szczecin, Poland, and losing another ATP final, this time in Metz, to [[Julien Benneteau]] and [[\u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin]].\n\n===2018===\n\nStarting the new year in [[2018 Brisbane International - Men's Doubles|Brisbane]], Sitak and Koolhof lost in the semi-finals to [[Leonardo Mayer]] and [[Horacio Zeballos]].  They lost in the first round in [[2018 ASB Classic - Men's Doubles|Auckland]] to [[Michael Venus (tennis)|Michael Venus]] and [[Raven Klaasen]], and then 7\u20136<sup>(5)</sup>, 4\u20136, 4\u20136 in the second round of the [[2018 Australian Open - Men's Doubles|Australian Open]] to the eventual winners, [[Oliver Marach]] and [[Mate Pavi\u0107]].  Although they were not in the original draw for the Mixed Doubles, Sitak and [[Olga Savchuk]] teamed up as alternates after an injury to [[Anastasia Rodionova]] in her women's doubles match meant that she and Marach could not participate.  They were beaten in a first-round match tie-break by [[Nadiia Kichenok]] and [[Marcel Granollers]].\n\nSitak and Koolhof then went to Newport Beach in California where, as top seeds, they lost in the first round, 2\u20136, 1\u20136, to [[Treat Huey]] and [[Denis Kudla]].  After that came the [[Davis Cup]] where, in [[Tianjin]], Sitak and [[Marcus Daniell]] lost their doubles tie to the lowly-ranked Chinese pair of [[Gong Mao-Xin]] and [[Zhang Ze]].  Sitak and Koolhof then lost in the quarter-finals at [[2018 Open Sud de France - Doubles|Montpellier]] before going all the way to the final in the [[2018 New York Open - Doubles|New York Open]], being beaten by [[Max Mirnyi]] and [[Philipp Oswald]] in a match tie-break.  They followed that up with a first round loss at [[2018 Delray Beach Open - Doubles|Delray Beach]] to [[Scott Lipsky]] and [[Divij Sharan]].\n\nTheir up and down season continued in Brazil, where they reached the final in [[2018 Brasil Open - Doubles|S\u00e3o Paulo]], but were beaten in straight sets by [[Federico Delbonis]] and [[M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez]].  Their next stop was Irving, Texas, where they lost in the semi-finals of the [[Irving Tennis Classic|ATP Challenger]] to [[Alexander Peya]] and [[Philipp Petzschner]].  Moving to Europe, and playing in the [[2018 JC Ferrero Challenger Open - Doubles|Alicante Challenger]] in Spain as preparation for the European clay court season, they won their second title together when they beat [[Guido Andreozzi]] and [[Ariel Behar]] 6\u20133, 6\u20132, in the final, but they lost in the first round of their next tournament in [[2018 Grand Prix Hassan II - Doubles|Marrakech]].  In the [[2018 Gazprom Hungarian Open - Doubles|Hungarian Open]] they beat the top seeds [[Nikola Mektic]] and [[Alexander Peya]] in the first round, but lost in the second to [[Marcin Matkowski]] and Sitak's former partner [[Nicholas Monroe]].\n\nTheir next tournament was at [[2018 Estoril Open - Doubles|Estoril]] where they went all the way to the final before losing to the British pair of [[Kyle Edmund]] and [[Cameron Norrie]], 2\u20136, 4\u20136.  They then lost in the first round of the [[2018 BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux|Bordeaux Challenger]] tournament after Sitak had been hit in the right ear by a smash from [[Radu Albot]], and also in the first round in [[2018 Geneva Open - Doubles|Geneva]], the last tournament before the French Open.\n\nAt [[2018 French Open - Men's Doubles|Roland Garros]], Sitak and Koolhof beat [[Andre Begemann]] and [[Antonio Sancic]] in the first round, then the ninth seeds [[Ivan Dodig]] and [[Rajeev Ram]], before going down to fifth seeds [[Juan Sebastian Cabal]] and [[Robert Farah (tennis)|Robert Farah]].  All three matches went to a deciding set.  After the tournament finished it was announced that the pair would split, with Koolhof joining Sitak's fellow New Zealander, and former partner, [[Marcus Daniell]], and Sitak linking up with Indian [[Divij Sharan]].<ref name=\"NZ Herald\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12064587|title= Big changes for Kiwi doubles players for grass court season|publisher=NZ Herald|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSitak and Sharan's first tournament together was at [[2018 Rosmalen Grass Court Championships - Men's Doubles|'s-Hertogenbosch]], where they were beaten in the semi-finals by [[Michael Venus (tennis)|Michael Venus]] and [[Raven Klaasen]].  They then lost in a big upset in the first round of qualifying at [[2018 Gerry Weber Open - Doubles|Halle]], before finding top seeds [[Juan Sebastian Cabal|Cabal]] and [[Robert Farah (tennis)|Farah]] their nemesis in the first round at [[2018 Eastbourne International - Men's Doubles|Eastbourne]].\n\nThey reached the quarter-finals at [[2018 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Doubles|Wimbledon]], the best-ever result in a Grand Slam tournament for either of them.  They had to come from two sets down in both their second and third round matches, against [[Julio Peralta]] and [[Horacio Zeballos]] and [[Marcin Matkowski]] and [[Jonathan Erlich]] respectively, before lining up against [[Mike Bryan]] and [[Jack Sock]] in the quarter-finals.  There were three tie-break sets to start, and just one loss of serve in the fourth set was enough to seal their defeat at the hands of the eventual champions.  In mixed doubles, Sitak teamed up with Ukrainian [[Lyudmyla Kichenok]] to beat Argentina's [[Leonardo Mayer]] and [[Maria Irigoyen]], but he withdrew from the second round due to fatigue from the length of the men's doubles matches.\n\nSitak teamed up with Erlich for the [[2018 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships - Doubles|Hall of Fame Championships]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], marching imperiously to the final, where they very quickly swept aside clay-court specialists [[Marcelo Arevalo]] and [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Reyes-Varela]].  Sitak maintained that it was their experience which counted - it was the 39th ATP final for Erlich, and the 11th for Sitak, but just the first for both their opponents.\n\nMoving on to Washington DC for the [[2018 Citi Open - Men's Doubles|Citi Open]], Sitak and Sharan beat [[James Cerretani|Jamie Cerretani]] and [[Leander Paes]] in the first round before losing to [[Jamie Murray]] and [[Bruno Soares]] in the quarter-finals.  Sitak then entered the [[2018 Rogers Cup - Men's Doubles|Toronto Masters]] with [[Stefanos Tsitsipas]], and received a first-round call up as an alternate for a withdrawn pair.  They ended up playing [[Michael Venus (tennis)|Michael Venus]] and [[Raven Klaasen]], and lost 6\u20134, 6\u20134.  Moving on to [[2018 Western & Southern Open - Men's Doubles|Cincinnati]] for the next Masters event, the pair qualified for direct acceptance.  In the first round they were drawn against [[Ivan Dodig]] and [[Robin Haase]], and lost in a match tie-break.\n\nIn his last tournament before the US Open, Sitak teamed up with [[Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi]] at [[2018 Winston-Salem Open - Doubles|Winston-Salem]].  They beat [[Max Mirnyi]] and [[Philipp Oswald]], then [[Marcelo Demoliner]] and [[Santiago Gonz\u00e1lez (tennis)|Santiago Gonzalez]], before falling to [[James Cerretani|Jamie Cerretani]] and [[Leander Paes]] in the semi-final.  In the [[2018 US Open - Men's Doubles|US Open]], Sitak and Sharan lost to eventual runners-up [[Lukasz Kubot]] and [[Marcelo Melo]] in the second round, while Sitak and [[Lyudmyla Kichenok]] were beaten in a tight first round battle in the [[2018 US Open - Mixed Doubles|mixed doubles]], losing 10\u20138 in the match tie-break to fourth seeds [[Latisha Chan]] and [[Ivan Dodig]].\n\nThe US Open was followed by New Zealand's [[Davis Cup]] tie against Korea in [[Gimcheon]], where Sitak and debutant [[Ajeet Rai]] were successful in their doubles rubber.  However, New Zealand lost the tie 3\u20132, and were relegated to Group II of the Asia/Oceania zone for the first time in five years.  Dashing back to France for what turned out to be just one match, Sitak, again with Qureshi, lost in the first round at [[2018 Moselle Open - Doubles|Metz]] to [[Oliver Marach]] and [[Jurgen Melzer]].  Reunited with Sharan a week later in China, they were upset in the first round of the [[2018 Chengdu Open - Doubles|Chengdu Open]] by [[Austin Krajicek]] and [[Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan]].\n\nIn the Japan Open they drew [[Jamie Murray]] and [[Bruno Soares]] in the first round, and lost in straight sets, and then were able to get into the [[2018 Shanghai Rolex Masters - Doubles|Shanghai Masters]] as an alternate entry, where they lost in the second round to Kubot and Melo, who went on to win the title.  Their next event was the [[2018 European Open - Doubles|European Open]] in Antwerp where, as fourth seeds, they lost to second seeds [[Nicolas Mahut]] and [[\u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin]] in an entertaining semi-final.\n\nFrom there they travelled to [[Basel]] for the [[2018 Swiss Indoors - Doubles|Swiss Indoors Open]], where they lost in an upset result in the semi-finals to [[Mischa Zverev|Mischa]] and [[Alexander Zverev]].  They finished their season at the [[2018 Rolex Paris Masters - Doubles|Paris Masters]] where, with only an hour's notice, they again took the court as an alternate.  They beat [[Feliciano Lopez|Feliciano]] and [[Marc Lopez]] in the first round, but lost in straight sets in the second round to the best team in the world for 2018, [[Mike Bryan]] and [[Jack Sock]].\n\n===2019===\nWith a new partner in the left-handed American [[Austin Krajicek]], Sitak began 2019 in [[2019 Brisbane International - Men's Doubles|Brisbane]], where they lost in the quarter-finals to [[Rajeev Ram]] and [[Joe Salisbury]].  They also lost in the quarter-finals in [[2019 ASB Classic - Men's Doubles|Auckland]], this time to [[Bob Bryan|Bob]] and [[Mike Bryan]], the former playing his first tournament since being injured in Monte Carlo and subsequently having surgery to replace his hip.\n\nThe [[2019 Australian Open - Men's Doubles|Australian Open]] also saw them record a win and a loss, beating [[Leander Paes]] and [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Reyes-Varela]] in the first round, but losing a tight match to eventual semi-finalists [[Ryan Harrison]] and [[Sam Querrey]] in the second, 6\u20134, 7\u20136<sup>(5)</sup>.  Sitak had another new partner in the mixed doubles, teaming up with former World doubles number one [[Ekaterina Makarova]].  Seeded eighth, they lost in the first round to [[Andreja Klepa\u010d]] and [[\u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin]].\n\nSitak and Krajicek then lost in the first round at [[2019 Open Sud de France - Doubles|Montpellier]] before going to [[2019 ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament - Doubles|Rotterdam]], where they got into the main draw as Lucky Losers, but again lost in the first round.  The same fate awaited them in [[2019 Rio Open - Doubles|Rio de Janeiro]], but they had far better luck in [[2019 Abierto Mexicano Telcel - Men's Doubles|Acapulco]], where they finished runners-up to [[Mischa Zverev|Mischa]] and [[Alexander Zverev]] after easily taking the first set of the final.  It was the first ATP500 series final for both Sitak and Krajicek.\n\nBecause of their relative rankings, Sitak found a new partner for [[2019 BNP Paribas Open - Men's Doubles|Indian Wells]] in singles specialist [[Nikoloz Basilashvili]], but they went out in the first round to eighth seeds [[Henri Kontinen]] and [[John Peers]].  That meant that he and Krajicek were able to go straight to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], where they had walk-overs in the first two rounds of the [[2019 Arizona Tennis Classic - Doubles|Phoenix Challenger]], beat [[James Cerretani|Jamie Cerretani]] and [[Nicholas Monroe]] in the semi-finals, and lost to [[Jamie Murray]] and [[Neal Skupski]] in the final.\n\nFrom there they went to [[2019 Miami Open - Men's Doubles|Miami]], where they lost in the first round, and on to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] for the [[2019 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships - Doubles|US Clay Court Championships]], where they lost to the Skupski brothers in the semi-finals.  That was followed by a loss in qualifying in [[2019 Barcelona Open Banco Sabadell - Doubles|Barcelona]] and a quarter-final loss in [[2019 BMW Open - Doubles|Munich]] before a first round loss in [[2019 Mutua Madrid Open - Men's Doubles|Madrid]], where they had got in as an alternate pair.\n\nThey also got into the [[2019 Italian Open - Men's Doubles|Italian Open]] as an alternate pair, and this time made it to the second round, losing to eventual champions [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal]] and [[Robert Farah]].  Another first round loss, this time as second seeds in [[2019 Geneva Open - Doubles|Geneva]], preceded their attempt at the [[2019 French Open - Men's Doubles|French Open]], where Krajicek dropped a bombshell just a couple of days before their first round match by announcing that he would be ending their partnership after this tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12235610|title= Tennis: Kiwi doubles ace Artem Sitak reveals partner's bombshell just before French Open|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=2019-05-19|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>.  Seeded 16th, the pair didn't have a single practice together before losing in the first round to [[Hsieh Cheng-peng]] and [[Christopher Rungkat]].  He and [[Makoto Ninomiya]] played [[2019 French Open - Mixed Doubles|mixed doubles]] together, but lost in a first round match tie-break to eventual semi-finalists [[Nadiia Kichenok]] and [[Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi]].\n\nSitak had different partners for each of his first three grass tournaments before winning the [[2019 Antalya Open - Doubles|Antalya Open]] with [[Jonathan Erlich]] in a week where the on-court temperatures seldom dropped below 40 degrees Celsius.  They defeated [[Ivan Dodig]] and [[Filip Pol\u00e1\u0161ek]] in straight sets in the final, having beaten French Open champions [[Kevin Krawietz]] and [[Andreas Mies]] in the first round.  At [[2019 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Doubles|Wimbledon]] Sitak and Erlich lost in the first round to [[M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez]] and [[Horacio Zeballos]], but Sitak went much further in the [[2019 Wimbledon Championships - Mixed Doubles|mixed doubles]].\n\nAlthough he and [[Laura Siegemund]] made it to the quarter-finals before losing to fifth seeds [[Kv\u011bta Peschke]] and [[Wesley Koolhof]], it's their first round match against [[Darija Jurak]] and [[Ken Skupski]] which will go down in history, the sprinklers facing Sitak and Siegemund bursting into life as they sat down with the score at 4-3 in the final set.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-06/wimbledon-sprinkler-soaks-players-at-doubles-match/11284844|title= Rogue sprinkler causes chaos at Wimbledon|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=2019-07-06|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>.  The match was eventually moved to another court to be finished.  As if that wasn't enough, their top quality third round match against third seeds [[Gabriela Dabrowski]] and [[Mate Pavi\u0107]] took three hours and 17 minutes, becoming the first mixed doubles match to require Wimbledon's innovation of a tie-break at 12-12 in the final set.\n\nSitak and Erlich were unable to defend their title in [[2019 Hall of Fame Open - Doubles|Newport]], losing in the first round, before Sitak teamed up with [[Radu Albot]] to reach the semi-finals in [[2019 BB&T Atlanta Open - Doubles|Atlanta]], but they lost in the first round in [[2019 Los Cabos Open - Doubles|Los Cabos]].  Next up was the [[2019 US Open - Men's Doubles|US Open]], where Sitak and [[Denys Molchanov]] lost in the first round to second seeds [[\u0141ukasz Kubot]] and [[Marcelo Melo]].  The same fate befell him in the [[2019 US Open - Mixed Doubles|mixed doubles]], where he and [[Lucie Hradeck\u00e1]] also lost in the first round.\n\nTwo more first round losses followed before Sitak reunited with [[Divij Sharan]].  Although losing their first match together, they reached the quarter-finals of the [[2019 Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships \u2013 Doubles|Japan Open]].  They made the [[2019 Rolex Paris Masters - Doubles|Paris Masters]] as alternates, beating Pavi\u0107 and [[Bruno Soares]] in the first round before losing to [[J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy]] and [[Fabrice Martin]] in the second.  Two first round losses in Challenger events ended the 2019 season for Sitak.\n\n==ATP career finals==\n===Doubles: 13 (5 titles, 8 runners-up)===\n{|\n|-

His most prominent feature is his set of \"dead fish-eyes\" that puts people off. Due to years of social isolation, he has developed a habit of observing people in his surroundings from a distance, earning him a skill for social perception, figuring out the true nature of people. He believes that youth is an illusion created by hypocrites, for hypocrites, born from his past failures. His experience leads him to believe the happiness of others is a facade. He is affectionately called \"Hikki\" by Yui. Hayato's clique wrongly address him as \"Hikitani\".\n\n: His teacher Shizuka worries about him becoming a social outcast and forces him to join the Service Club. Hachiman believes himself to be an insignificant entity and is willing to take the blame in order to keep everyone else happy.\n: On the first day of high school, he winds up in a car accident from trying to save Yui's puppy and ends up in the hospital for three weeks, making him an outsider once he gets back because the whole class has already formed its cliques. He thinks that Yui's feelings for him are due to guilt and thus, indirectly rejects Yui, thinking he would cause trouble for her. He also distances himself from Yukino after realizing that the car that rammed into him belongs to her family. In both cases, they make amends with him once said misunderstandings are cleared. It is suggested that he is aware of the girl's feelings, due to studying people's behavior and doesn't accept them as genuine.\n;{{Nihongo|Yukino Yukinoshita|\u96ea\u30ce\u4e0b \u96ea\u4e43|Yukinoshita Yukino}}{{anchor|Yukino Yukinoshita}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Saori Hayami]]|Melissa Molano<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Yukino is a student in class 2J and the leader of the Service Club but was the sole member until Hachiman joined. Born to a wealthy family, she is smart, beautiful, and nicknamed the \"Ice-cold Beauty\" for her icy demeanour. She shows no empathy and little kindness towards Hachiman at first, but eventually opens up to him. Due to her talent and beauty, she is envied by most girls and is disgusted by their attitude to undermine her instead of improving themselves, thus she has few friends. She has a twisted sense of ''noblesse oblige'', and believes it is the duty of the exceptional to help the \"lost lambs\" of the world. She essentially wants to help others, but is brutally honest and directly analyses their flaws. Her personality often leads her to be disgusted at the naivet\u00e9 and lack of understanding how things work of others, particularly Yui's, and she does not hesitate to show it. Despite this, Yui still affectionately refers to her as \"Yukinon\"; thanks to her, Yukino becomes kinder and the two girls become best friends. She recognizes Hachiman from the car accident but lies about it when Hachiman joins the Service Club. She is devastated when he distances himself from her, after learning it from her sister. Throughout the series, she develops feelings for him.\n;{{nihongo|Yui Yuigahama|\u7531\u6bd4\u30f6\u6d5c \u7d50\u8863|Yuigahama Yui}}{{anchor|Yui Yuigahama}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Cat Thomas<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Yui is Hachiman's classmate. A cheerful, outgoing girl, she becomes the Service Club's first \"customer,\" asking them to help her bake cookies for \"a certain someone.\" By no means cynical and the friendliest member of the group, her problems lie not with her personality, but with her inability to express herself due to fear of losing friends, and thus admires Yukino and Hachiman, who are able to express their true feelings. She believes that talent is inborn, and often aspires to be like others until Yukino changes her way of thinking. Following her experience with the Service Club, Yui begins to attend Service Club sessions after school as well, despite Yukino's objections early on. In class, Yui is a member of Hayato's clique but has no say in matters as she is often overwhelmed by Yumiko. She has been holding feelings towards Hachiman ever since he saved her dog on the first day of high school.\n\n===Class 2F===\n;{{Nihongo|Saika Totsuka|\u6238\u585a \u5f69\u52a0|Totsuka Saika}}{{anchor|Saika Totsuka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]]|[[Margaret McDonald (voice actress)|Margaret McDonald]]<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Saika is the president of the tennis club who has an [[androgyny|androgynous appearance]] but prefers others to not mistake his gender. He is called \"The Prince\" by his female classmates. On their first meeting, Saika asks help from Hachiman to join the tennis club, which was brushed off by Yukino. Saika then asked the Service Club to help him improve his tennis skills. He eventually became one of the few people in class 2F who would talk to Hachiman on a first name basis, and often hangs out with him. Despite knowing that Saika is a boy, Hachiman oftentimes finds himself unwillingly attracted to him.\n;{{Nihongo|Hayato Hayama|\u8449\u5c71 \u96bc\u4eba|Hayama Hayato}}{{anchor|Hayato Hayama}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takashi Kond\u014d]]|Scott Gibbs<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Hayato is Yukino's childhood friend who is a central figure in class 2F and the ace of the football club. He is extremely kind to other people, including Hachiman, and often offers his help to others. However, Hayama claims that he can never forge a good relationship with Hachiman since, despite understanding his acts of social suicide to protect everyone, he does not agree with him. He and Yukino have some strain to their relationship, stemming from an incident in the past, and thus far, his attempts to mend his relationship with Yukino have failed. Despite his popularity and success, he feels largely inferior to Hachiman.\n;{{Nihongo|Yumiko Miura|\u4e09\u6d66 \u512a\u7f8e\u5b50|Miura Yumiko}}{{anchor|Yumiko Miura}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Marina Inoue]]|[[Christina Kelly]]<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Yumiko is a popular girl from class 2F with a pompous personality. She is the main female figure in Hayato's clique and it is hinted that she has feelings for Hayato. Due to her popularity, she has no trouble making friends, and thus has little to no understanding towards people who have social troubles. \n;{{Nihongo|Hina Ebina|\u6d77\u8001\u540d \u59eb\u83dc|Ebina Hina}}{{anchor|Hina Ebina}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nozomi Sasaki (voice actress)|Nozomi Sasaki]]|Natalie Rial<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}.\n:A close friend of Yumiko and Yui's, and a member of Hayato's clique. A massive Yaoi fangirl who loves to see two boys hitting on each other. When she gets riled up, all respect for personal space of others goes out the window.

She cares deeply for her brother as she hid her name and age to work as a night-shift bartender in order to pay school fees and reduce her family's load. After her brother asked for the Service Club's help, they eventually followed Saki to her workplace and found out her motives behind working night-shifts; she stopped working after the Service Club suggested her to aim for a scholarship instead.\n;{{Nihongo|Kakeru Tobe|\u6238\u90e8 \u7fd4|Tobe Kakeru}}{{anchor|Kakeru Tobe}}\n:{{voiced by|Chado Horii|Gareth West<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Tobe is a member of Hayato's clique who is in the football club. He has feelings for Hina and is the only guy in the class who supported Hina's script for the cultural festival. During the school excursion, he intended to confess to Hina and therefore requested help from the Service Club. However, Hachiman knew Hina did not want to get into a relationship, so he confesses to (and is rejected by) Hina to prevent Tobe from being rejected, thus maintaining the status quo within that group. \n;{{Nihongo|Yamato|\u5927\u548c|Yamato}}{{anchor|Yamato}}\n:{{voiced by|Yoshihisa Kawahara|Orlanders Jones<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Yamato is a member of Hayato's clique who is in the rugby club.\n;{{Nihongo|\u014coka|\u5927\u5ca1|\u014coka}}{{anchor|\u014coka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Minoru Shiraishi]]|Daniel Regojo<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: \u014coka is a member of Hayato's clique who is in the baseball club.\n;{{Nihongo|Minami Sagami|\u76f8\u6a21 \u5357|Sagami Minami}}{{anchor|Minami Sagami}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Minako Kotobuki]]|[[Caitlynn French]]<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Minami is the leader of the second most influential clique in class 2F and holds a grudge towards Yui, who she was friendly with during their first high school year, for being in the superior clique. She volunteered to be event organizer for the cultural festival in order to promote her worth without the actual ability to do such a job, and thus requested help from the Service Club. As such, Yukino took up the role of an assistant event organizer and claimed the spotlight in making the cultural festival a successful one, which in turn made Minami depressed about her own uselessness and refused to host the closing ceremony. However, as Hachiman's fierce scolding has successfully turned himself into the scapegoat and shifted the blame away from Minami, she attended the closing ceremony and ended the cultural festival on a high note.\n\n===Others===\n;{{Nihongo|Shizuka Hiratsuka|\u5e73\u585a \u9759|Hiratsuka Shizuka}}{{anchor|Shizuka Hiratsuka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ryoka Yuzuki]]|Heidi Hinkel<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Shizuka is Hachiman's teacher, a language teacher who serves as his futures advisor/ counsellor and the consultant for the service club. She is aware of Hachiman's supposed \"problems\", and takes steps to ensure he is freed from them, her first move being to force him into joining the Service Club. However, she appears to have some quirks of her own: she is a young smoker, she is very sensitive about her age and single status, and she is often prone to quoting or copying scenes from popular [[sh\u014dnen manga]]. Additionally, she never remembers to knock before entering the Service Club's classroom, much to Yukino's chagrin. After the cultural festival incident, she tells Hachiman that helping others should not be a reason for Hachiman to hurt himself, as there are others who would feel pain seeing Hachiman hurt.\n;{{Nihongo|Komachi Hikigaya|\u6bd4\u4f01\u8c37 \u5c0f\u753a|Hikigaya Komachi}}{{anchor|Komachi Hikigaya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]]|[[Hilary Haag]]<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Komachi is Hachiman's younger sister who, different from her brother, is cheerful and lively, and is a member of the student council in her school. She understands her brother's anti-social personality, cares for, and relies on him. While attached to her brother, she shows cleverness in trying to pair up Hachiman with Yukino or Yui.\n;{{Nihongo|Yoshiteru Zaimokuza|\u6750\u6728\u5ea7 \u7fa9\u8f1d|Zaimokuza Yoshiteru}}{{anchor|Yoshiteru Zaimokuza}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nobuyuki Hiyama]]|Andrew Love<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Yoshiteru is a student from class 2C who suffers from adolescent delusions.

Unlike Yukino, she shows a good attitude towards other people at first but eventually shows a sinister personality. Despite being a college student she spends a good deal of time spying on her sister's life. Yukino holds strong animosity towards her and Haruno can only say her sister constantly tries to overtake her as cute. Nonetheless, Haruno eventually shows her own grudges against Yukino and makes Yukino and Hachiman feel bad in the 2nd season.\n: She is a former student of S\u014dbu High School. She acknowledges Hachiman's perceptiveness and often playfully teases him.\n: Her being beautiful, rich, and charismatic makes people (including the series' audience) only see her good side, defer to her and ignore big problems she causes to others. For instance, in the 1st season, Haruno appears suddenly to abruptly intervene with the Cultural Festival where her role becomes to encourage the President to take it easy, resulting in delayed tasks. Hachiman takes part in picking up the slack and assumes his usual blame-taking role by complaining for the sake of others, complaints that only get him criticized, leading him to a dramatic confrontation with the Festival President.\n;{{Nihongo|Taishi Kawasaki|\u5ddd\u5d0e \u5927\u5fd7|Kawasaki Taishi}}{{anchor|Taishi Kawasaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ayumu Murase]]|Morgan Berry<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Taishi is Saki's little brother and Komachi's classmate.

Hayato at first tried to resolve the situation through talking to her in front of her classmates, which instead attracted more hateful attention to her. Hachiman and company decided that the only way out is to destroy the trust between her peers, through having Hayato and Kakeru acting as bullies threatening Rumi's group-mates during treasure hunt. However, Rumi was able to use her camera's flash as a distraction, allowing the group to escape. \n;{{Nihongo|Meguri Shiromeguri|\u57ce\u5efb \u3081\u3050\u308a|Shiromeguri Meguri}}{{anchor|Meguri Shiromeguri}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Azumi Asakura]]|[[Jad Saxton]]<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Meguri is a third-year student and the former president of S\u014dbu High School's student council.

As she was recommended as a candidate for the student council president in a prank, out of her dislike of the role, she filed a request to the Service Club in order to not get elected and yet not lose in an embarrassing fashion. She eventually accepts her role of being the student council president after Hachiman managed to convince her.

His most prominent feature is his set of \"dead fish-eyes\" that puts people off. Due to years of social isolation, he has developed a habit of observing people in his surroudings from a distance, earning him a skill for social perception, figuring out the true nature of people. He believes that youth is an illusion created by hypocrites, for hypocrites, born from his past failures. His experience leads him to believe the happiness of others is a facade. He is affectionately called \"Hikki\" by Yui. Hayato's clique wrongly address him as \"Hikitani\".\n\n: His teacher Shizuka worries about him becoming a social outcast and forces him to join the Service Club. Hachiman believes himself to be an insignificant entity and is willing to take the blame in order to keep everyone else happy.\n: On the first day of high school, he winds up in a car accident from trying to save Yui's puppy and ends up in the hospital for three weeks, making him an outsider once he gets back because the whole class has already formed its cliques. He thinks that Yui's feelings for him are due to guilt and thus, indirectly rejects Yui, thinking he would cause trouble for her. He also distances himself from Yukino after realizing that the car that rammed into him belongs to her family. In both cases, they make amends with him once said misunderstandings are cleared. It is suggested that he is aware of the girl's feelings, due to studying people's behavior and doesn't accept them as genuine.\n;{{Nihongo|Yukino Yukinoshita|\u96ea\u30ce\u4e0b \u96ea\u4e43|Yukinoshita Yukino}}{{anchor|Yukino Yukinoshita}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Saori Hayami]]|Melissa Molano<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Yukino is a student in class 2J and the leader of the Service Club but was the sole member until Hachiman joined. Born to a wealthy family, she is smart, beautiful, and nicknamed the \"Ice-cold Beauty\" for her icy demeanour. She shows no empathy and little kindness towards Hachiman at first, but eventually opens up to him. Due to her talent and beauty, she is envied by most girls and is disgusted by their attitude to undermine her instead of improving themselves, thus she has few friends. She has a twisted sense of ''noblesse oblige'', and believes it is the duty of the exceptional to help the \"lost lambs\" of the world. She essentially wants to help others, but is brutally honest and directly analyses their flaws. Her personality often leads her to be disgusted at the naivet\u00e9 and lack of understanding how things work of others, particularly Yui's, and she does not hesitate to show it. Despite this, Yui still affectionately refers to her as \"Yukinon\"; thanks to her, Yukino becomes kinder and the two girls become best friends. She recognizes Hachiman from the car accident but lies about it when Hachiman joins the Service Club. She is devastated when he distances himself from her, after learning it from her sister. Throughout the series, she develops feelings for him.\n;{{nihongo|Yui Yuigahama|\u7531\u6bd4\u30f6\u6d5c \u7d50\u8863|Yuigahama Yui}}{{anchor|Yui Yuigahama}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Cat Thomas<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Yui is Hachiman's classmate. A cheerful, outgoing girl, she becomes the Service Club's first \"customer,\" asking them to help her bake cookies for \"a certain someone.\" By no means cynical and the friendliest member of the group, her problems lie not with her personality, but with her inability to express herself due to fear of losing friends, and thus admires Yukino and Hachiman, who are able to express their true feelings. She believes that talent is inborn, and often aspires to be like others until Yukino changes her way of thinking. Following her experience with the Service Club, Yui begins to attend Service Club sessions after school as well, despite Yukino's objections early on. In class, Yui is a member of Hayato's clique but has no say in matters as she is often overwhelmed by Yumiko. She has been holding feelings towards Hachiman ever since he saved her dog on the first day of high school.\n\n===Class 2F===\n;{{Nihongo|Saika Totsuka|\u6238\u585a \u5f69\u52a0|Totsuka Saika}}{{anchor|Saika Totsuka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]]|[[Margaret McDonald (voice actress)|Margaret McDonald]]<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Saika is the president of the tennis club who has an [[androgyny|androgynous appearance]] but prefers others to not mistake his gender. He is called \"The Prince\" by his female classmates. On their first meeting, Saika asks help from Hachiman to join the tennis club, which was brushed off by Yukino. Saika then asked the Service Club to help him improve his tennis skills. He eventually became one of the few people in class 2F who would talk to Hachiman on a first name basis, and often hangs out with him. Despite knowing that Saika is a boy, Hachiman oftentimes finds himself unwillingly attracted to him.\n;{{Nihongo|Hayato Hayama|\u8449\u5c71 \u96bc\u4eba|Hayama Hayato}}{{anchor|Hayato Hayama}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takashi Kond\u014d]]|Scott Gibbs<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Hayato is Yukino's childhood friend who is a central figure in class 2F and the ace of the football club. He is extremely kind to other people, including Hachiman, and often offers his help to others. However, Hayama claims that he can never forge a good relationship with Hachiman since, despite understanding his acts of social suicide to protect everyone, he does not agree with him. He and Yukino have some strain to their relationship, stemming from an incident in the past, and thus far, his attempts to mend his relationship with Yukino have failed. Despite his popularity and success, he feels largely inferior to Hachiman.\n;{{Nihongo|Yumiko Miura|\u4e09\u6d66 \u512a\u7f8e\u5b50|Miura Yumiko}}{{anchor|Yumiko Miura}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Marina Inoue]]|[[Christina Kelly]]<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Yumiko is a popular girl from class 2F with a pompous personality. She is the main female figure in Hayato's clique and it is hinted that she has feelings for Hayato. Due to her popularity, she has no trouble making friends, and thus has little to no understanding towards people who have social troubles. \n;{{Nihongo|Hina Ebina|\u6d77\u8001\u540d \u59eb\u83dc|Ebina Hina}}{{anchor|Hina Ebina}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nozomi Sasaki (voice actress)|Nozomi Sasaki]]|Natalie Rial<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}.\n:A close friend of Yumiko and Yui's, and a member of Hayato's clique. A massive Yaoi fangirl who loves to see two boys hitting on each other. When she gets riled up, all respect for personal space of others goes out the window. She has an eye for detail, especially for clothing.\n;{{Nihongo|Saki Kawasaki|\u5ddd\u5d0e \u6c99\u5e0c|Kawasaki Saki}}{{anchor|Saki Kawasaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ami Koshimizu]]|Teresa Zimmermann<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Saki is Hachiman's classmate who seems like a delinquent but wants to make friends deep down. She cares deeply for her brother as she hid her name and age to work as a night-shift bartender in order to pay school fees and reduce her family's load. After her brother asked for the Service Club's help, they eventually followed Saki to her workplace and found out her motives behind working night-shifts; she stopped working after the Service Club suggested her to aim for a scholarship instead.\n;{{Nihongo|Kakeru Tobe|\u6238\u90e8 \u7fd4|Tobe Kakeru}}{{anchor|Kakeru Tobe}}\n:{{voiced by|Chado Horii|Gareth West<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Tobe is a member of Hayato's clique who is in the football club. He has feelings for Hina and is the only guy in the class who supported Hina's script for the cultural festival. During the school excursion, he intended to confess to Hina and therefore requested help from the Service Club. However, Hachiman knew Hina did not want to get into a relationship, so he confesses to (and is rejected by) Hina to prevent Tobe from being rejected, thus maintaining the status quo within that group. \n;{{Nihongo|Yamato|\u5927\u548c|Yamato}}{{anchor|Yamato}}\n:{{voiced by|Yoshihisa Kawahara|Orlanders Jones<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Yamato is a member of Hayato's clique who is in the rugby club.\n;{{Nihongo|\u014coka|\u5927\u5ca1|\u014coka}}{{anchor|\u014coka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Minoru Shiraishi]]|Daniel Regojo<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: \u014coka is a member of Hayato's clique who is in the baseball club.\n;{{Nihongo|Minami Sagami|\u76f8\u6a21 \u5357|Sagami Minami}}{{anchor|Minami Sagami}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Minako Kotobuki]]|[[Caitlynn French]]<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Minami is the leader of the second most influential clique in class 2F and holds a grudge towards Yui, who she was friendly with during their first high school year, for being in the superior clique. She volunteered to be event organizer for the cultural festival in order to promote her worth without the actual ability to do such a job, and thus requested help from the Service Club. As such, Yukino took up the role of an assistant event organizer and claimed the spotlight in making the cultural festival a successful one, which in turn made Minami depressed about her own uselessness and refused to host the closing ceremony. However, as Hachiman's fierce scolding has successfully turned himself into the scapegoat and shifted the blame away from Minami, she attended the closing ceremony and ended the cultural festival on a high note.\n\n===Others===\n;{{Nihongo|Shizuka Hiratsuka|\u5e73\u585a \u9759|Hiratsuka Shizuka}}{{anchor|Shizuka Hiratsuka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ryoka Yuzuki]]|Heidi Hinkel<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Shizuka is Hachiman's teacher, a language teacher who serves as his futures advisor/ counsellor and the consultant for the service club. She is aware of Hachiman's supposed \"problems\", and takes steps to ensure he is freed from them, her first move being to force him into joining the Service Club. However, she appears to have some quirks of her own: she is a young smoker, she is very sensitive about her age and single status, and she is often prone to quoting or copying scenes from popular [[sh\u014dnen manga]]. Additionally, she never remembers to knock before entering the Service Club's classroom, much to Yukino's chagrin. After the cultural festival incident, she tells Hachiman that helping others should not be a reason for Hachiman to hurt himself, as there are others who would feel pain seeing Hachiman hurt.\n;{{Nihongo|Komachi Hikigaya|\u6bd4\u4f01\u8c37 \u5c0f\u753a|Hikigaya Komachi}}{{anchor|Komachi Hikigaya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]]|[[Hilary Haag]]<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Komachi is Hachiman's younger sister who, different from her brother, is cheerful and lively, and is a member of the student council in her school. She understands her brother's anti-social personality, cares for, and relies on him. While attached to her brother, she shows cleverness in trying to pair up Hachiman with Yukino or Yui.\n;{{Nihongo|Yoshiteru Zaimokuza|\u6750\u6728\u5ea7 \u7fa9\u8f1d|Zaimokuza Yoshiteru}}{{anchor|Yoshiteru Zaimokuza}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nobuyuki Hiyama]]|Andrew Love<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Yoshiteru is a student from class 2C who suffers from adolescent delusions. He sees Hachiman as a friend after being paired up with him during physical education lessons. While he is annoying, he has a group of [[otaku]] friends he's on good terms with. He aims to be a light novel writer.\n;{{Nihongo|Haruno Yukinoshita|\u96ea\u30ce\u4e0b \u967d\u4e43|Yukinoshita Haruno}}{{anchor|Haruno Yukinoshita}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mai Nakahara]]|Olivia Swasey<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Haruno is Yukino's elder sister. Unlike Yukino, she shows a good attitude towards other people at first but eventually shows a sinister personality. Despite being a college student she spends a good deal of time spying on her sister's life. Yukino holds strong animosity towards her and Haruno can only say her sister constantly tries to overtake her as cute. Nonetheless, Haruno eventually shows her own grudges against Yukino and makes Yukino and Hachiman feel bad in the 2nd season.\n: She is a former student of S\u014dbu High School. She acknowledges Hachiman's perceptiveness and often playfully teases him.\n: Her being beautiful, rich, and charismatic makes people (including the series' audience) only see her good side, defer to her and ignore big problems she causes to others. For instance, in the 1st season, Haruno appears suddenly to abruptly intervene with the Cultural Festival where her role becomes to encourage the President to take it easy, resulting in delayed tasks. Hachiman takes part in picking up the slack and assumes his usual blame-taking role by complaining for the sake of others, complaints that only get him criticized, leading him to a dramatic confrontation with the Festival President.\n;{{Nihongo|Taishi Kawasaki|\u5ddd\u5d0e \u5927\u5fd7|Kawasaki Taishi}}{{anchor|Taishi Kawasaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ayumu Murase]]|Morgan Berry<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Taishi is Saki's little brother and Komachi's classmate.

Hayato at first tried to resolve the situation through talking to her in front of her classmates, which instead attracted more hateful attention to her. Hachiman and company decided that the only way out is to destroy the trust between her peers, through having Hayato and Kakeru acting as bullies threatening Rumi's group-mates during treasure hunt. However, Rumi was able to use her camera's flash as a distraction, allowing the group to escape. \n;{{Nihongo|Meguri Shiromeguri|\u57ce\u5efb \u3081\u3050\u308a|Shiromeguri Meguri}}{{anchor|Meguri Shiromeguri}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Azumi Asakura]]|[[Jad Saxton]]<ref name=\"Dub cast\" />}}\n: Meguri is a third-year student and the former president of S\u014dbu High School's student council.

As of 2017, there were a hundred wineries of various sizes[6] with about 266 hectares of vineyards,[7] an area that in the past reached 400, mainly of cannonau. [8]\n\nSince the last years of the 20th century, tourism-related activities have also grown, especially in connection with cultural heritage and local events.\n\n==Culture ==\n\nHolidays and Folk Traditions Edit\nS'Antoni de su 'ohu, in January\nHarrasehare Mamujadinu, In February\nSantu Bustianu, in June\nMamuMask, International Mask Festival, end of June\nOn Carmu, in July\nLoret'Attesu, July\nSantu Cosomo and Damianu, late September\nSas Tappas in Mamujada, November\nMamuthones and Issohadores Edit\nMagnifying glass icon mgx2.svg The same topic in detail: Mamuthones and Mamoiada Carnival.\nThe mysterious Mamoiadin carnival - with ancestral origins - is among the oldest popular events in Sardinia. [4] [5] Its protagonists, the Mamuthones and the Issohadores, have long become the recognized symbol of the country. The Mamuthones, curved under the weight of the cowbells, and with their faces covered by a black wooden mask, move slowly in two parallel rows, giving a shoulder shot to shake the whole grille, with a very special clang. The Issohadores escort them with more agile steps and leaps, dressed in white mask and red bodice, and throw the snare (in the soha Mamoiadin dialect) suddenly capturing the young women as a sign of good health and fertility, or even the friend in a sign of chosen affection in the crowd, and then release it soon after. Once the landowners were caught, who, in order to pay off the honour reserved for them, then took the whole group home, offering wine and sweets. The issohador leader gives orders to the mamuthones and gives the rhythm to the dance. These masks make their first appearance on January 17 of each year on the occasion of the feast of St. Anthony Abbot. The festival is called St. Antoni and on 'ohu (\"St. Anthony of Fire\"), because, as in many Sardinian countries and other regions of the Mediterranean, numerous bonfires are lit around which the mysterious dances of the Mamuthones and Issohadores take place. The rite seems to have an apotropaic or propitiatory meaning. The noisy rattlesnake dance would serve to ward off evil and foster abundant agricultural years. Similar customs are found in other villages in various European countries.\n\nAlong with the masks of many European countries, Issohadores and Mamuthones can be seen at the recently expanded Museum of Mediterranean Masks. The Museum competes at the International Museum of Carnival and Mask of the Belgian city of Binche the greatest completeness of testimonies and finds on the carnival of the Mediterranean basin. The property organizes frequent international exchanges with museums, cultural institutions and associations working in this area.\n\n\nAbout Passu Torrau Edit\nOn Passu Torr\u00e0u, literally \"the step returned\", it is a dance, it is now widespread throughout Sardinia but seems to be native to the village of Mamoiada. In fact, in many recordings of many Sardinian players such as Mondo Vercellino, Mario and Francesco Bande is called \"Sa Mamojadina\".\n\n==Geography==\n\nMamoiada is located in the innermost part of Ollolai Barbagia, in a territory where numerous streams flow and flow, through land largely used for cultivation or grazing. The presence of these environmental resources has attracted human settlements since the Neolithic and pre-Neolithic, with a variety of significant archaeological and anthropological traces (from the votive stone, to the nuraghe, to menhir and dolmen, as far as the latter is concerned today there is no longer testimony, except the place names of the places where es. sa copreccada arose). It strikes Sa Perda Pint\u00e0 (i.e. \"the painted stone\", also known as Stele di Boeli), a 270 cm high slab marked with concentric circles and coppelles, all similar to similar slabs spread in the celt area (Scotland, Ireland, Corsica, Wales and Brittany).\n\nOther architectural legacies of later eras are mainly represented by churches. The church of Loreto, with a dome full of frescoes, was probably built around 1600. The sanctuary of saints Cosma and Damiano, which follows a much older structure, is located 5 km from the town on the Marghine Plateau, next to the road leading to Gavoi. The shrine is surrounded by about fifty houses for pilgrims (umbiss\u00ecas).\n\nThe altitude of the territory of the municipality is between 390 m and 1,048 m above sea level.\n\n==History== \n\nThe area was inhabited in pre-Nuragic, Nuragic (presence of domus de janas and some nuraghi) and Roman. Due to its strategic location at the north-south axis of Sardinia, along the Ulbiam-Caralis road, the village of Mamoiada was affected by a Roman military presence. The Su hastru ward has a name that follows what the Romans gave to their little pres\u00ecds (Castrum). The Roman presence is also evidenced by the fountain of Su hantaru vetzu (i.e. \"The Old Source\"), at the center of the ward of the same name.\n\nIn the Middle Ages he belonged to the Judge of Arborea and was part of the curator of the Barbagia of Ollolai. At the fall of the judge (1420) it passed under the rule of the Marquis of Oristano, and then passed under Aragonese domination (1478). In 1604 he was merged with the Duchy of Mandas, a fiefdom of the Maza. Dai Maza then moved to Tellez-Giron of Alcantara, to whom he was redeemed in 1839 with the suppression of the feudal system desired by the Savoy.\n\nMamoiada borders the following municipalities: [[Fonni]], [[Gavoi]], [[Nuoro]], [[Ollolai]], [[Orani, Italy|Orani]], [[Orgosolo]], [[Sarule]].\n\n== Demographic evolution ==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=none|cols=2\n|1861|1927\n|1871|2039\n|1881|2060\n|1901|2332\n|1911|2632\n|1921|2549\n|1931|2724\n|1936|2834\n|1951|3098\n|1961|3233\n|1971|2795\n|1981|2713\n|1991|2633\n|2001|2580\n|source=Data from ISTAT\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Mamoiada}}\n<references/>\n\n{{clear}}\n{{Province of Nuoro}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Sardinia]]\n\n\n{{Sardinia-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Italian comune\n| name                = Mamoiada\n| official_name       = Comune di Mamoiada\n| native_name         = Mamujada\n| image_skyline       = Mamoiada Panorama.jpg\n| imagesize           =  \n| image_alt           = \n| image_caption       =  \n| image_shield        = \n| shield_alt          = \n| image_map           = \n| map_alt             = \n| map_caption         = \n| pushpin_map         = Italy#Italy Sardinia\n| coordinates         = {{coord|40|13|N|9|17|E|type:city(2,582)_region:IT|display=inline,title}}\n| coordinates_footnotes = \n| region              = [[Sardinia]]\n| province            = [[Province of Nuoro]] (NU)\n| frazioni            = \n| mayor_party         = \n| mayor               = Graziano Deiana\n| area_footnotes      = \n| area_total_km2      = 48.43\n| population_footnotes = \n| population_total    = 2582\n| population_as_of    = Dec. 2004\n| pop_density_footnotes = \n| population_demonym  = \n| elevation_footnotes = \n| elevation_m         = 650\n| saint               = \n| day                 = \n| postal_code         = 08024\n| area_code           = 0784\n| website             = \n| footnotes           = \n}}\n\n'''Mamoiada''' ({{lang-sc|Mamujada}}) is a ''[[comune]]'' (municipality) in the [[Province of Nuoro]] in the [[Italy|Italian]] region of [[Sardinia]], located about {{cvt|110|km|mi}} north of [[Cagliari]] and about {{cvt|12|km|mi|0}} southwest of [[Nuoro]].
