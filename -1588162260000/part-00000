Ko\u0161tunica received 50.26 percent of the vote in the first round of voting, just a few thousand votes over the threshold needed to win outright. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 disputed the results of the first round, claiming that Ko\u0161tunica had only received 49 percent of the vote and a runoff was required. The Otpor movement, a student-led movement to oust Milosevic and install free and fair elections, organized a protest where thousands of Serbians participated in strikes and took over the Belgrade capital and forced Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to accept the results and step down as president. Ko\u0161tunica then assumed the presidency. He was the last president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
