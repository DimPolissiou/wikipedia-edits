The operation was carried out by [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Gerald Lathbury]]'s [[1st Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Parachute Brigade]], part of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]]. Their objective was the Primosole Bridge across the [[Simeto|Simeto River]]. The intention was for the brigade, with glider-borne forces in support, to land on both sides of the river. They would then capture the bridge and secure the surrounding area until relieved by the advance of [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]], which had landed on the south eastern coast three days previously. Because the bridge was the only crossing on the river and would give the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] access to the [[Catania]] plain, its capture was expected to speed the advance and lead to the defeat of the [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] in Sicily.\n\nMany of the aircraft carrying the paratroopers from North Africa were shot down or were damaged and turned back by friendly fire and enemy action. Evasive action taken by the pilots scattered the brigade over a large area and only the equivalent of two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of troops were landed in the correct locations. Despite this and the defence by [[Wehrmacht|German]] and [[Royal Italian Army during World War II|Italian]] forces, the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|British paratroops]] captured the bridge, repulsed attacks and held out against increasing odds until nightfall. The relief force led by the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], under [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Sidney Kirkman|Sidney C. Kirkman]], which was short of transport, were still {{convert|1|mi}} away when they halted for the night. By this time, with casualties mounting and supplies running short, the parachute brigade commander, Gerald Lathbury, had relinquished control of the bridge to the Germans. The following day the British units joined forces and the 9th Battalion, [[Durham Light Infantry]], with tank support, attempted to recapture the bridge. The bridge was not finally secured until three days after the start of the operation, when another battalion of the Durham Light Infantry, led by the paratroopers, established a bridgehead on the north bank of the river.\n\nThe capture of Primosole Bridge did not lead to the expected rapid advance, as by this time the Germans had gathered their forces and established a defensive line. It was not until early the following month that the Eighth Army captured [[Catania]]. By this time the 1st Parachute Brigade had been withdrawn to [[Malta]] and took no further part in the conquest of Sicily. Lessons were learned from the operation and were put into practice in [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] airborne operations.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Ladbroke|Operation Mincemeat}}\nAfter the [[Axis powers]] were [[Tunisia Campaign|defeated in North Africa]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies' next logical objective was to cross the [[Mediterranean]], landing in either the south of France, the Balkans, Sicily or Italy. The objective chosen was Sicily, with the landing scheduled for 10 July 1943.<ref name=tug156>Tugwell, p.156</ref> The Allied [[15th Army Group]], commanded by [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]], consisted of the [[Seventh United States Army|American Seventh Army]], commanded by [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton|George Patton]], which would land in the west between [[Licata]] and [[Scoglitti]],<ref name=tug156/> and the veteran [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], commanded by the experienced General [[Bernard Montgomery]], which would land in the south east between [[Cape Passero]] and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].<ref name=cole49/>\n[[File:Map operation husky landing.jpg|thumb|Map of the July 1943 Allied landings in Sicily.]]\n\nIn addition to the seaborne landings, there were also airborne landings during the invasion. The [[82nd Airborne Division|U.S. 82nd Airborne Division]], under [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Matthew Ridgway]], would land in support of the Seventh Army, while the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]], under [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major General]] [[George F. Hopkinson|George Hopkinson]], conducted brigade-sized landings along the eastern coast to support the Eighth Army.<ref name=tug156/>\n\nThe first British airborne landing was Operation Ladbroke, which was carried out by the [[1st Airlanding Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Airlanding Brigade]], under [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Philip Hugh Whitby Hicks|Philip Hicks]], during the night of 9\u201310 July. Their objective was to seize and hold the [[Ponte Grande]] bridge just outside Syracuse.<ref name=rey36>Reynolds, p.36</ref> The second British airborne mission, Operation Glutton, was to have been undertaken by the [[2nd Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Parachute Brigade]], under Brigadier [[Ernest Down]], on the night of 10\u201311 July, aiming to capture a bridge beside [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]]. However circumstances changed and the second operation was cancelled.<ref name=rey36/>\n\nThe third British airborne mission planned was Operation Fustian, to be carried out by the [[1st Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Parachute Brigade]], under Brigadier [[Gerald Lathbury]], and scheduled for the night of 13\u201314 July.<ref name=rey36/> The 1st Parachute Brigade's objective was the Primosole bridge, crossing the [[Simeto]] River, south of [[Catania]].<ref>Tugwell, p.159</ref> The bridge was a vital objective, as it was the only crossing point over the Simeto. Its capture would give the Eighth Army access to the Catania plain, to enable them to continue their advance northwards; its destruction would seriously hamper the advance.<ref name=rey37>Reynolds, p.37</ref> Once the parachute brigade had captured the bridge, they would then have to defend it until relieved by units of the Eighth Army advancing from the landing beaches.<ref>Tugwell, p.162</ref><ref name=rey47>Reynolds, p.47</ref>\n\n===British forces===\nThe 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Lathbury, comprised the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment|1st]], the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|2nd]] and [[3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|3rd Parachute Battalions]], the [[16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance]], the 1st&nbsp;(Parachute) Squadron, [[Royal Engineers]] and the 1st&nbsp;(Airlanding) [[Anti-tank warfare|Anti-Tank]] Battery, [[Royal Artillery]]. The airlanding anti-tank battery were equipped with the 1st Para Brigade's only anti-tank guns, the [[Ordnance QF-6 pounder|British 6&nbsp;pounder]]. Despite the formation being a parachute brigade, the only way to transport the anti-tank guns and the [[Willys MB|jeeps]] required to pull them when they had landed, was by glider.<ref name=cole35>Cole, p.35</ref> Transporting artillery by air was something new to the British or any other army, and this would be the first time that any artillery guns had ever been flown into combat.<ref>Carman, p.23</ref>\n\nThe 1st Parachute Brigade was an experienced formation, initially under command of the 1st Airborne Division before being detached from the division to fight in North Africa. The brigade had taken part in the [[Operation Torch|landings in Algeria]] in November 1942 and the subsequent [[Tunisia Campaign|Battle of Tunisia]], during which each of the brigade's three parachute battalions [[British airborne operations in North Africa|had taken part in their own battalion-sized parachute landings]].<ref>Reynolds, pp.30\u201332</ref> It was during this campaign that the 1st Parachute Brigade had been given their nickname the ''Red Devils'' by the Germans.<ref>Reynolds, p.34</ref> A British parachute battalion had an establishment of 556 men in three [[company (military unit)|rifle companies]]. Each of the companies were divided into a small headquarters and three [[platoon]]s. The platoons had three [[section (military unit)|sections]]; each section had a [[Bren machine gun]] and a [[2-inch mortar]] as well as the men's own personal weapons.<ref>Guard, p.37</ref> The only heavy weapons in the parachute battalion were in the [[Ordnance ML 3 inch Mortar|3-inch Mortar]] platoon and the [[Vickers machine gun]] platoon which were part of the battalion headquarters.<ref>Peters and Buist, p.55</ref>\n[[File:British paratroopers April 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|British paratroopers]], before taking part in a practice parachute jump in April 1944.]]\n\nIt was decided that the brigade's paratroops would land on four separate drop zones and that the gliders would land at two landing zones. The paratroops of the 1st Parachute Battalion were divided into two groups, one of which would land at 'Drop zone One' to the north of the river, and the second at 'Drop zone Two' to the south of it.<ref name=mar83/> Once they had landed the two groups would head for their assembly points, before conducting an assault on the bridge from both sides simultaneously.<ref name=rey37/> The 2nd Parachute Battalion were to be landed south of the bridge on 'Drop zone Three', in the area between the [[Gornalunga Canal]] and the main highway.<ref name=mar83>Mrazek, p.83</ref> The 2nd Battalion then had to assault and occupy three small hills, which had been given the codenames 'Johnny&nbsp;I', 'Johnny&nbsp;II' and 'Johnny&nbsp;III'. The hills were believed to be occupied by an Italian force of around platoon strength. Once the battalion had secured the three hills, they were to dig in and prepare to defend the hills against an attack from the south.<ref name=rey37/><ref name=mitch150/> The 3rd Parachute Battalion would land at 'Drop zone Four', {{convert|1000|yd}} north of the bridge.<ref name=mar83/> Their objective was to secure the ground in this area, defending against any counterattack from the direction of Catania.<ref name=mitch150/> The brigade's glider force had two landing areas, 'Landing zone Seven' north of the river and 'Landing zone Eight' south of the river.<ref name=mar83/> Owing to the complexity of the landing plan and the short time between inception and execution, the [[pathfinders (military)|pathfinders]] belonging to the 21st&nbsp;Independent Parachute Company, [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]], would be deployed to mark the correct drop zones. This was the first occasion this had been done in British airborne operations.<ref name=tug163>Tugwell, p.163</ref> The pathfinder company had special marker lights and [[Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar|Rebecca and Eureka]] beacons that the transport aircraft and gliders would be able to identify and home in on.<ref name=ferg12>Ferguson, p.12</ref>\n\nThe senior officers of the 1st Airborne Division had estimated that there would be around 450 casualties during the capture of the bridge, of which 25 per cent would be killed or missing, and the other 75 per cent wounded.<ref name=cole35/> It was appreciated that by themselves the three battalions' medical officers and staff would be unable to cope with the expected numbers of casualties, so one [[Section (military unit)|section]] from the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, consisting of one doctor and 16 [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]], would be attached to each of the parachute battalions. The remainder of the [[field ambulance]], comprising the headquarters with two surgical teams, would be co-located with the brigade and establish their main dressing station in farm buildings to the south of the bridge.<ref name=\"cole45\">Cole, p.45</ref>\n\nAfter problems with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the [[Royal Air Force]] advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in their normal 'V' formation.<ref name=tug163/> The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.<ref name=\"tugwell164\">Tugwell, p.164</ref>\n\nUnconnected with Operation Fustian, but being conducted at the same time, [[No. 3 Commando]] would carry out a separate operation {{convert|8|mi}} to the south of the Simeto River. The commando unit were to carry out an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landing]] from the sea, then assault and capture the [[Malati Bridge]] over the [[Leonardo River]].<ref name=mitch150>Mitcham, p.150</ref>\n[[File:Pachino, Sicily, 1943.jpg|thumb|Sicily 1943, British infantry with a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]] to their rear.]]\n\nThe relieving force for both the commandos and paratroopers would be from [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]], commanded by [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Miles Dempsey|Miles C. Dempsey]]. The [[corps]] consisted of the [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Division]], [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]] and the [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th Armoured Brigade]].<ref name=mitch335/> The armoured brigade, with three tank [[regiment]]s, was equipped with the American built [[Lend-Lease Sherman tanks|Sherman tank]].<ref name=mitch335>Mitcham, p.335</ref> Early on 13&nbsp;July the commander of the 50th Division, [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Sidney Kirkman|Sidney C. Kirkman]], was called to [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]]'s [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] headquarters. Here he was informed about the two missions by the [[British Commandos]] and the 1st Parachute Brigade, and the requirement for the bridges to be captured intact. Montgomery's intention was for the 50th Division to lead the Eighth Army's advance and relieve the commandos and the paratroopers. To assist Kirkman in the task, Montgomery placed the 4th Armoured Brigade under his command.<ref name=mitch154>Mitcham, p.154</ref> Montgomery was insistent that he wanted the infantry division to relieve the parachute brigade early on 14 July, which would require the division to advance around {{convert|25|mi}} in 24 hours.<ref name=mitch154/> The 50th Division had landed on 10 July and by this time had been fighting for three days non-stop. With the daily temperature most of the time reaching {{convert|100|F|C}}, many of the men in the division were physically exhausted and suffering from heat exhaustion.<ref name=mitch154/> The division's situation was not improved by a grave error of judgement by Montgomery. During the planning for the invasion, he had overestimated the strength of the German and Italian resistance to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landings. The British Eighth Army consisted mainly of infantry, tanks and heavy weapons but were light on any form of mechanical transport, so any advance by the 50th Division would have to be conducted on foot.<ref>Mitcham, p.82</ref>\n\n===Axis forces===\nThe [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]] force in the area of Primosole Bridge came from the [[213 Coastal Division]] commanded by General Carlo Gotti.<ref name=mitch152/> Coastal divisions were second line divisions, usually formed from men in their forties and fifties, and were intended to perform labour or other second line duties. Recruited from the local population, their officers were mostly men who had retired but had then been called up again. Their morale was low, not least because of their second rate equipment and weapons. It had been intended to improve their armaments with equipment seized from the recently disbanded [[Vichy French]] army, but when the arms arrived in Sicily, many of them had been made unusable, and some had the wrong type of ammunition or no ammunition at all.<ref>Jowett, p.6</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-757-0023-32, Oslo, Fallschirmj\u00e4ger auf Flugplatz.jpg|thumb|German [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]] of the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger-Regiment 1 in Oslo, 1940.]]\n\nThe Italians were supported by [[Fallschirmjager|German paratroopers]] of the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|1st Parachute Division]], who were ordered to move to Sicily from France, and if necessary were to parachute in on 9&nbsp;July.<ref>Mitcham, p.72</ref> The 1st Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Machine Gun Battalion commanded by Major Werner Schmidt had landed at Catania during an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air raid early on 13&nbsp;July. Their aircraft and anti-tank guns were destroyed during the raid, so the battalion left on foot for Primosole Bridge.<ref name=mitch150/> When Schmidt informed the divisional commander of his intentions, he was warned to expect a sea or airborne landing that night. If the Allies landed to the rear of the division, Schmidt's battalion had to hold Primosole Bridge so that the division could escape.<ref>Mitcham, pp.150\u2013151</ref> Forewarned in this way, the machine gun battalion started to dig in and prepare a defence around {{convert|2000|yd}} to the south of the bridge once they arrived, well located to deal with any parachute or glider landing in that area.<ref name=mitch151>Mitcham, p.151</ref>\n\n===Primosole Bridge===\nThe Primosole Bridge is built from steel [[girder]]s. It has a [[Span (architecture)|span]] of {{convert|400|ft}}, and is raised {{convert|8|ft}} above the Simeto River. The land to the north of the bridge is mainly [[olive]] and [[almond]] groves in tree-lined fields. Immediately to the south of the bridge is the Gornalunga canal, and beyond that three prominent hills.<ref name=mitch150/> The road crossing the bridge is Highway 114, running  from [[Lentini]] {{convert|10|mi}} to the south to Cantini {{convert|7|mi}} to the north.<ref name=mar83/> To assist the Italians defending the bridge, four [[Bunker|pillbox bunkers]] had been constructed, two on the north bank and two on the south bank.<ref>Mitcham, pp.157\u2013158</ref>\n\n==Fustian==\nAt 19:30 on 13&nbsp;July&nbsp;1943, the first aircraft carrying the 1,856 men of the [[1st Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Parachute Brigade]] took off from North Africa.<ref name=\"cole45\"/><ref>Mitcham, p.148</ref> The aircraft used consisted of 105&nbsp;[[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s belonging to the [[51st Troop Carrier Wing]], 51 each from the [[60th Troop Carrier Group|60th]] and the [[62d Troop Carrier Group]]s, while the [[64th Troop Carrier Group]] supplied the other three. [[No. 38 Group RAF|No. 38 Wing Royal Air Force]] supplied eleven [[Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle]]s.<ref name=mra82>Mrazek, p.82</ref> Following behind the parachute force were the glider towing aircraft. These aircraft, again supplied by No. 38 Wing, comprised 12 Albemarles and seven [[Handley Page Halifax]]es, towing 11 [[Airspeed Horsa|Horsa gliders]] and eight [[Waco CG-4|Waco gliders]]. The gliders were used to carry 77 men, mostly from the anti-tank battery, ten 6&nbsp;pounder anti-tank guns and 18 [[Willys MB|jeeps]].<ref name=mra82/>\n[[File:Two USAAF C-47A Skytrains.jpg|thumb|A pair of C-47 Skytrains, similar to the 105 C-47s used in the operation.]]\n\nThe aircraft's flight path took them around the south eastern corner of [[Malta]] and up the eastern coast of Sicily.<ref name=mra82/> The route was measured to ensure that the first planes arrived over the drop zones at 22:20.<ref name=\"cole45\"/> When the planes arrived off Sicily, they were supposed to stay {{convert|10|mi}} offshore until reaching the Simeto River, when they would head inland for the drop zones.<ref name=mra84>Mrazek, p.84</ref> Somehow, 33 aircraft strayed off course and approached an Allied convoy. The naval gunners had been warned to expect an air raid, and opened fire on the American and British aircraft.<ref name=mra84/> Two of the planes, trying to avoid the unexpected anti-aircraft fire, collided and crashed into the sea.<ref name=mra84/> Another two were shot down, and nine were so badly shot up, with wounded crew and passengers, that they were forced to turn back towards their airfields in North Africa.<ref name=rey37/>\n\nThose aircraft that did reach the Sicilian coast were engaged by Axis anti-aircraft guns, which shot down 37 of them. Another ten were damaged and were forced to abort their mission.<ref name=rey37/> Some of the inexperienced pilots now refused to go any further, and on his aircraft [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alastair Pearson]], [[commanding officer]] of the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment|1st Parachute Battalion]], realising his plane was flying round in circles, had to threaten to shoot the crew to make them continue.<ref name=\"tugwell164\"/> The anti-aircraft fire and the evasive action taken by the pilots had dispersed the aircraft formations, and the parachute drop was scattered over a large area.<ref name=cole47/> The violent evasive manoeuvring left some of the paratroopers in heaps on the aircraft floor, and they were unable to jump when ordered. When safely back out to sea, some of the pilots refused to try again, considering the risk too great.<ref>Cole, p.46</ref> Of the surviving aircraft which carried on with the mission, only 39 managed to drop their paratroops within {{convert|.5|mi}} of the correct drop zone.<ref name=\"tugwell164\"/> The furthest off course were some groups from the [[3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|3rd Parachute Battalion]] and [[Royal Engineers]] who landed {{convert|12|mi}} to the south of the bridge,<ref name=cole47>Cole, p.47</ref> while another four aircraft landed their paratroops on the slopes of [[Mount Etna]] {{convert|20|mi}} to the north.<ref name=ferg12/>\n\nThose men of the 1st Parachute Brigade that landed on the southern drop zone were well within range of the 1st [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]] Machine Gun Battalion. In the darkness, the Germans initially thought that the paratroopers were their own reinforcements landing, but they soon realised their mistake and opened fire.<ref name=mitch151/> Some of those who escaped the machine gun fire were rounded up on the drop zone, and about 100&nbsp;of them became [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] as soon as they had touched ground.<ref name=mitch152>Mitcham, p.152</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is noteworthy that the British paratroopers caught in the branches of the fruit trees, were not killed out of hand, but were allowed to surrender.<ref name=mitch152/>|group=nb}} In the confusion of the landing, 50 men of the 1st Parachute Battalion had assembled, assaulted and managed to capture the bridge before the 50 Italian defenders could destroy it with the attached demolition charges. The Italians were taken prisoner, just as a second group of 40 paratroopers led by [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Gerald Lathbury|Lathbury]] arrived at the bridge. Lathbury organised the safe removal of the demolition charges and set up a defensive perimeter. More paratroopers continued to gather at the bridge, and soon they numbered around 120&nbsp;men, who dug in to the north and south.<ref name=mitch152/>\n\nThe Brigade Headquarters and the field ambulance main dressing station were established to the south of the bridge, where the brigade's casualties started arriving for treatment.<ref name=cole47/> Away from the main dressing station, the medics on the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|2nd Battalion]] drop zone had 29 wounded as a result of the parachute drop, and there were 15 wounded on drop zone one from the 1st Battalion.<ref>Cole, pp.47\u201348</ref>\n[[File:Parachute training North Africa1943.jpg|thumb|[[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|British paratroopers]] advance in line abreast.]]\n\nThe first glider casualties had occurred on take off, when two aircraft towing [[Waco glider]]s crashed.<ref name=mra84/> While en route, one of the gliders was released early by its towing aircraft, and crashed into the sea.

Their first assault was against the 2nd Parachute Battalion's positions, and was unsuccessful. However, their next assault, later in the morning, succeeded in capturing Johnny II, the second of the small hills. Lieutenant Colonel [[John Frost (British Army officer)|John Frost]], in command of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, immediately counterattacked, but his men were repulsed after sustaining a number of casualties.<ref name=mitch156/> At 09:00 a [[forward observation officer]] attached to the 2nd Parachute Battalion managed to make radio contact with the British [[cruiser]] [[HMS Newfoundland (59)|HMS ''Newfoundland'']], which then used its 6-inch guns to target the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger positions.<ref name=mitch156/> The [[naval gunfire support|naval gunfire]] had the desired effect, causing the Germans some casualties and keeping them under cover. From then on, German resistance from the south was restricted to harassing machine gun fire. A grass fire they started did force the 2nd Parachute Battalion to abandon Johnny I, and the remnants of the battalion now concentrated on Johnny III.<ref name=mitch157>Mitcham, p.157</ref>\n\nTo the north of the bridge, a German scratch-built [[Battlegroup (army)|battle group]] of 350 men, including the 1st Company, 1st Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Signal Battalion, an anti-aircraft battery and some anti-tank guns, was gathered under the command of Captain Franz Strangenberg, supported by the 113rd Light Trucks Company of the 10th [[Arditi]] Regiment (the \"Commandos\" unit of the Italian Army) with 56 men and six heavily armed [[SPA-Viberti AS.42]]<ref>https://www.ecodegliblei.it/CATANIA-LA-BATTAGLIA-DEL-PONTE-DI-PRIMOSOLE-E-IL-SACRIFICIO-DEGLI-ARDITI-DEL-II-BATTAGLIONE-DEL-X.htm</ref>, Strangenberg was in position to launch his first assault on the bridge at 14:00.

It also secured a position for the 88s to engage the two pillboxes on the north bank.<ref name=mitch157/> By 17:00 the men of the 1st Parachute Battalion were almost out of ammunition, and were forced to withdraw to the southern side of the bridge.<ref name=mitch156/> The German 88s were moved forward again, and this time demolished the pillboxes on the south side. Running short of supplies and with his casualties mounting, Brigadier Lathbury made the decision to relinquish control of the bridge to the Germans, and the parachute brigade moved back {{convert|1200|yd}}. Of the 295 men who had been at the bridge, 115 had become casualties.<ref name=\"mitch156\" /> The [[16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance]] main dressing station could not be moved or evacuated, and remained behind in [[no man's land]].<ref name=\"cole48\">Cole, p.48</ref>\n\nAn Italian officer entered the station, and informed the medical staff they were now prisoners of war, but since they were treating casualties from both sides, they were allowed to remain and continue operating.<ref name=cole49/> Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the [[surgeons]] had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients.<ref name=\"cole48\"/> At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led the remainder of his men to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.<ref name=qua77>Quarrie, p.77</ref>\n\nBy dawn, the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]] had only managed to advance {{convert|10|mi}}, and were still {{convert|8|mi}} from No. 3 Commando at the Melati bridge and {{convert|15|mi}} from Primosole Bridge.<ref name=mitch155>Mitcham, p.155</ref> It was not until 17:00&nbsp;that the 5th Battalion, [[East Yorkshire Regiment]], part of the [[69th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|69th Infantry Brigade]], eventually reached Malati Bridge, although by now the [[No. 4 Commando|commandos]] had been forced to withdraw.<ref>D'Este, p.360</ref> The bridge was quickly captured; the commandos had dismantled the demolition charges so that it could not be demolished.

They now comprised the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the Arditi Battalion, with the German 1st Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Machine Gun Battalion and Captain Stangenberg's Battle group. The German High Command was aware of the importance of holding the bridge, and overnight they dispatched reinforcements who arrived by parachute. These came from the 1st Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Division, and consisted of the 1st Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Engineer Battalion, the 1st Battalion, 4th Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Regiment and a battalion of the 1st Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Artillery Regiment.<ref name=qua77/><ref>Mitchum, p.159</ref> The Fallschirmj\u00e4ger engineers started to form a defensive line to the north of the bridge, and a smaller one on the southern bank.<ref name=qua77/>\n[[File:Primosole Bridge over the Simeto River1943.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Engineers]] repairing the bridge after it was captured by the British for the second time.]]\n\nEarly on 15 July, the 1st Parachute Brigade heard tank fire to the south of their position. Brigadier Lathbury sent out a patrol to investigate, which located the tanks and infantry of [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] that had halted just south of them the previous night.<ref name=tug165>Tugwell, p.165</ref> The 1st Parachute Brigade and 50th (Northumbrian) Division now moved forward together. The main dressing station, which had continued to operate after being captured, was liberated by the 2nd Parachute Battalion.<ref name=cole49/> In an attempt to recapture Primosole Bridge the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, supported by the [[44th Royal Tank Regiment]], carried out a number of assaults. At one stage they managed to cross the bridge, but three Sherman tanks accompanying them were knocked out by the German 88s, and with no armoured support the infantry were forced to withdraw. However, an error in communication caused the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Engineer Battalion to withdraw to the north bank of the river, and this allowed the Durhams to establish a position at the southern end of the bridge.<ref name=qua77/> At the main dressing station the surgeons had operated on another 14 wounded by the time ambulances arrived from XIII Corps at 17:00 to evacuate the wounded.<ref name=cole49>Cole, p.49</ref> At 18:00 the Main Dressing Station was closed and the men moved to Johnny I. During the time the main dressing station had been active, the surgeons had completed 31 operations, and the medics had treated 109 wounded.<ref>Cole, p.50</ref>\n\nThe Germans were aware that the British paratroopers had dismantled the explosive charges attached to Primosole Bridge, and now attempted to destroy it by driving trucks laden with explosives onto it. This was unsuccessful.<ref>D'Este, p.392</ref>\n\nDuring the night the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry continued trying to capture the bridge. Their attacks  also provided a distraction for the Germans<ref name=cole49/> while Lieutenant Colonel Pearson of the 1st Parachute Battalion led two companies of the 8th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry across the Simeto River using a small [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] to establish another bridgehead on the northern bank.

The operation was carried out by [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Gerald Lathbury]]'s [[1st Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Parachute Brigade]], part of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]]. Their objective was the Primosole Bridge across the [[Simeto|Simeto River]]. The intention was for the brigade, with glider-borne forces in support, to land on both sides of the river. They would then capture the bridge and secure the surrounding area until relieved by the advance of [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]], which had landed on the south eastern coast three days previously. Because the bridge was the only crossing on the river and would give the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] access to the [[Catania]] plain, its capture was expected to speed the advance and lead to the defeat of the [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] in Sicily.\n\nMany of the aircraft carrying the paratroopers from North Africa were shot down or were damaged and turned back by friendly fire and enemy action. Evasive action taken by the pilots scattered the brigade over a large area and only the equivalent of two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of troops were landed in the correct locations. Despite this and the defence by [[Wehrmacht|German]] and [[Royal Italian Army during World War II|Italian]] forces, the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|British paratroops]] captured the bridge, repulsed attacks and held out against increasing odds until nightfall. The relief force led by the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], under [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Sidney Kirkman|Sidney C. Kirkman]], which was short of transport, were still {{convert|1|mi}} away when they halted for the night. By this time, with casualties mounting and supplies running short, the parachute brigade commander, Gerald Lathbury, had relinquished control of the bridge to the Germans. The following day the British units joined forces and the 9th Battalion, [[Durham Light Infantry]], with tank support, attempted to recapture the bridge. The bridge was not finally secured until three days after the start of the operation, when another battalion of the Durham Light Infantry, led by the paratroopers, established a bridgehead on the north bank of the river.\n\nThe capture of Primosole Bridge did not lead to the expected rapid advance, as by this time the Germans had gathered their forces and established a defensive line. It was not until early the following month that the Eighth Army captured [[Catania]]. By this time the 1st Parachute Brigade had been withdrawn to [[Malta]] and took no further part in the conquest of Sicily. Lessons were learned from the operation and were put into practice in [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] airborne operations.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Ladbroke|Operation Mincemeat}}\nAfter the [[Axis powers]] were [[Tunisia Campaign|defeated in North Africa]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies' next logical objective was to cross the [[Mediterranean]], landing in either the south of France, the Balkans, Sicily or Italy. The objective chosen was Sicily, with the landing scheduled for 10 July 1943.<ref name=tug156>Tugwell, p.156</ref> The Allied [[15th Army Group]], commanded by [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]], consisted of the [[Seventh United States Army|American Seventh Army]], commanded by [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton|George Patton]], which would land in the west between [[Licata]] and [[Scoglitti]],<ref name=tug156/> and the veteran [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], commanded by the experienced General [[Bernard Montgomery]], which would land in the south east between [[Cape Passero]] and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].<ref name=cole49/>\n[[File:Map operation husky landing.jpg|thumb|Map of the July 1943 Allied landings in Sicily.]]\n\nIn addition to the seaborne landings, there were also airborne landings during the invasion. The [[82nd Airborne Division|U.S. 82nd Airborne Division]], under [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Matthew Ridgway]], would land in support of the Seventh Army, while the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]], under [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major General]] [[George F. Hopkinson|George Hopkinson]], conducted brigade-sized landings along the eastern coast to support the Eighth Army.<ref name=tug156/>\n\nThe first British airborne landing was Operation Ladbroke, which was carried out by the [[1st Airlanding Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Airlanding Brigade]], under [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Philip Hugh Whitby Hicks|Philip Hicks]], during the night of 9\u201310 July. Their objective was to seize and hold the [[Ponte Grande]] bridge just outside Syracuse.<ref name=rey36>Reynolds, p.36</ref> The second British airborne mission, Operation Glutton, was to have been undertaken by the [[2nd Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Parachute Brigade]], under Brigadier [[Ernest Down]], on the night of 10\u201311 July, aiming to capture a bridge beside [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]]. However circumstances changed and the second operation was cancelled.<ref name=rey36/>\n\nThe third British airborne mission planned was Operation Fustian, to be carried out by the [[1st Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Parachute Brigade]], under Brigadier [[Gerald Lathbury]], and scheduled for the night of 13\u201314 July.<ref name=rey36/> The 1st Parachute Brigade's objective was the Primosole bridge, crossing the [[Simeto]] River, south of [[Catania]].<ref>Tugwell, p.159</ref> The bridge was a vital objective, as it was the only crossing point over the Simeto. Its capture would give the Eighth Army access to the Catania plain, to enable them to continue their advance northwards; its destruction would seriously hamper the advance.<ref name=rey37>Reynolds, p.37</ref> Once the parachute brigade had captured the bridge, they would then have to defend it until relieved by units of the Eighth Army advancing from the landing beaches.<ref>Tugwell, p.162</ref><ref name=rey47>Reynolds, p.47</ref>\n\n===British forces===\nThe 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Lathbury, comprised the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment|1st]], the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|2nd]] and [[3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|3rd Parachute Battalions]], the [[16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance]], the 1st&nbsp;(Parachute) Squadron, [[Royal Engineers]] and the 1st&nbsp;(Airlanding) [[Anti-tank warfare|Anti-Tank]] Battery, [[Royal Artillery]]. The airlanding anti-tank battery were equipped with the 1st Para Brigade's only anti-tank guns, the [[Ordnance QF-6 pounder|British 6&nbsp;pounder]]. Despite the formation being a parachute brigade, the only way to transport the anti-tank guns and the [[Willys MB|jeeps]] required to pull them when they had landed, was by glider.<ref name=cole35>Cole, p.35</ref> Transporting artillery by air was something new to the British or any other army, and this would be the first time that any artillery guns had ever been flown into combat.<ref>Carman, p.23</ref>\n\nThe 1st Parachute Brigade was an experienced formation, initially under command of the 1st Airborne Division before being detached from the division to fight in North Africa. The brigade had taken part in the [[Operation Torch|landings in Algeria]] in November 1942 and the subsequent [[Tunisia Campaign|Battle of Tunisia]], during which each of the brigade's three parachute battalions [[British airborne operations in North Africa|had taken part in their own battalion-sized parachute landings]].<ref>Reynolds, pp.30\u201332</ref> It was during this campaign that the 1st Parachute Brigade had been given their nickname the ''Red Devils'' by the Germans.<ref>Reynolds, p.34</ref> A British parachute battalion had an establishment of 556 men in three [[company (military unit)|rifle companies]]. Each of the companies were divided into a small headquarters and three [[platoon]]s. The platoons had three [[section (military unit)|sections]]; each section had a [[Bren machine gun]] and a [[2-inch mortar]] as well as the men's own personal weapons.<ref>Guard, p.37</ref> The only heavy weapons in the parachute battalion were in the [[Ordnance ML 3 inch Mortar|3-inch Mortar]] platoon and the [[Vickers machine gun]] platoon which were part of the battalion headquarters.<ref>Peters and Buist, p.55</ref>\n[[File:British paratroopers April 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|British paratroopers]], before taking part in a practice parachute jump in April 1944.]]\n\nIt was decided that the brigade's paratroops would land on four separate drop zones and that the gliders would land at two landing zones. The paratroops of the 1st Parachute Battalion were divided into two groups, one of which would land at 'Drop zone One' to the north of the river, and the second at 'Drop zone Two' to the south of it.<ref name=mar83/> Once they had landed the two groups would head for their assembly points, before conducting an assault on the bridge from both sides simultaneously.<ref name=rey37/> The 2nd Parachute Battalion were to be landed south of the bridge on 'Drop zone Three', in the area between the [[Gornalunga Canal]] and the main highway.<ref name=mar83>Mrazek, p.83</ref> The 2nd Battalion then had to assault and occupy three small hills, which had been given the codenames 'Johnny&nbsp;I', 'Johnny&nbsp;II' and 'Johnny&nbsp;III'. The hills were believed to be occupied by an Italian force of around platoon strength. Once the battalion had secured the three hills, they were to dig in and prepare to defend the hills against an attack from the south.<ref name=rey37/><ref name=mitch150/> The 3rd Parachute Battalion would land at 'Drop zone Four', {{convert|1000|yd}} north of the bridge.<ref name=mar83/> Their objective was to secure the ground in this area, defending against any counterattack from the direction of Catania.<ref name=mitch150/> The brigade's glider force had two landing areas, 'Landing zone Seven' north of the river and 'Landing zone Eight' south of the river.<ref name=mar83/> Owing to the complexity of the landing plan and the short time between inception and execution, the [[pathfinders (military)|pathfinders]] belonging to the 21st&nbsp;Independent Parachute Company, [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]], would be deployed to mark the correct drop zones.

In particular, it does not bite on transfers of wealth made long enough before death to fall outside the charge....

In addition to statutory indexation of the threshold and rate bands, I propose this year to reform the tax radically.\n\n:In essence, the capital transfer tax is two taxes, as its two separate scales imply: an inheritance tax and a lifetime gifts tax. We have had an inheritance tax in some shape or form ever since Sir William Harcourt introduced his estate duty in 1894. But the lifetime gifts tax which the Labour Government introduced in 1974, in the teeth of united Conservative opposition, is an unwelcome and unwarranted impost. By deterring lifetime giving, it has had the effect of locking in assets, particularly the ownership of family businesses, often to the detriment of the businesses concerned.\n\n:Accordingly, I propose to abolish entirely the tax on lifetime gifts to individuals.

In particular, it does not bite on transfers of wealth made long enough before death to fall outside the charge....

In addition to statutory indexation of the threshold and rate bands, I propose this year to reform the tax radically.\n\n:In essence, the capital transfer tax is two taxes, as its two separate scales imply: an inheritance tax and a lifetime gifts tax. We have had an inheritance tax in some shape or form ever since Sir William Harcourt introduced his estate duty in 1894. But the lifetime gifts tax which the Labour Government introduced in 1974, in the teeth of united Conservative opposition, is an unwelcome and unwarranted impost. By deterring lifetime giving, it has had the effect of locking in assets, particularly the ownership of family businesses, often to the detriment of the businesses concerned.\n\n:Accordingly, I propose to abolish entirely the tax on lifetime gifts to individuals. As with the old estate duty, there will be a tapered charge on gifts made within seven years of death and provisions to charge gifts made with reservation; and the regime for trusts, which is needed as a protection for the death charge, will be kept broadly unchanged....

Harrison\" (29 September 1905 \u2013 29 December 1987) was one of the leading [[Musicology|musicologists]] of his time and a pioneering [[Ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]]. Initially trained as an organist and composer, he turned to musicology in the early 1950s, first specialising in English and Irish music of the Middle Ages and increasingly turning to ethnomusicological subjects in the course of his career. His ''Music in Medieval Britain'' (1958) is still a standard work on the subject, and ''Time, Place and Music'' (1973) is a key textbook on ethnomusicology.\n\n==Education and early musical career==\nBorn in [[Dublin]], Ireland, Harrison was the second son of Alfred Francis Harrison and Florence May, n\u00e9e Nash. The Welsh origin of his second given name, \"Llewellyn\", derives from his maternal grandmother, a Williams from Anglesey.<ref>D. F. L. Chadd: \"Francis Llewellyn Harrison, 1905\u20131987\", in: ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' (1989), p. 361; see Bibliography.</ref> He became a chorister at [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] in 1912 and was educated at the cathedral grammar school (until 1920) and at [[Mountjoy School]] (1920\u20131922). A competent organist, he was deputy organist at St Patrick's from 1925 to 1928. In 1920, he also began musical studies at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]], where he studied with [[John F. Larchet]] (composition), George Hewson (organ) and [[Michele Esposito]] (piano). In 1926, he graduated Bachelor of Music at [[Trinity College Dublin]] and was awarded a doctorate (MusD) in 1929 for a musical setting of Psalm 19. He then worked in [[Kilkenny]] for one year, serving as organist at [[St Canice's Cathedral]] and music teacher at [[Kilkenny College]].<ref>Robin Elliott: \"Harrison, Frank [Francis] Llewellyn\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p. 469; see Bibliography.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Harrison emigrated to Canada to become organist at Westminster Presbyterian Church in [[New Glasgow, Nova Scotia]]. In 1933, he studied briefly with [[Marcel Dupr\u00e9]] in France, but returned to Canada in 1934 to become organist at [[Knox Presbyterian Church (Ottawa)|Knox Presbyterian Church]] in [[Ottawa]]. In 1935, he took a position as organist and choirmaster at [[St. George's Cathedral (Kingston, Ontario)|St. George's Cathedral]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], as well as taking up the newly created post of \"resident musician\" at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]]. His duties included \"giving lectures, running a choir and an orchestra, and conducting concerts himself. His course in the history and appreciation of music was the first music course to be given for full credit at Queen's.\"<ref>[https://www.queensu.ca/encyclopedia/h/harrison-frank ''Queen's Encyclopedia'']; retrieved 16 March 2020.</ref> He resigned from St. George's in 1941 to become assistant professor of music at Queen's in 1942. During his years in Canada he still pursued the idea of remaining a performing musician and composer, winning three national composition competitions: for ''Winter's Poem'' (1931), ''Baroque Suite'' (1943) and ''Night Hymns on Lake Nipigon'' (1945).<ref>Elliott (2013), p. 469.</ref>\n\nOn a year's leave of absence from Queen's Harrison studied composition with [[Paul Hindemith]] at [[Yale University]], also taking courses in musicology with [[Leo Schrade]]. In 1946, he took up a position at [[Colgate University]] in Hamilton, New York, and then moved on to [[Washington University in St. Louis]], as head of the new Department of Music (1947\u20131950).\n\n==Musicological career==\nIn 1951, Harrison took the degrees of Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Music (DMus) at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], and became lecturer (1952),  senior lecturer (1956), and reader in the history of music (1962\u201370) there. In 1965, he was elected Fellow the [[British Academy]] and Senior Research Fellow at Oxford. From 1970 to 1980, Harrison was Professor of Ethnomusicology at the [[University of Amsterdam]], the Netherlands, retiring to part-time teaching in 1976.\n\nHe also held Visiting Professorships in musicology at Yale University (1958\u20139), [[Princeton University]] (spring 1961 and 1968\u20139), and [[Dartmouth College]] (winter 1968 and spring 1972). He also briefly returned to Queen's University at Kingston as Queen's Quest Visiting Professor in the fall of 1980 and was Visiting Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Music at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] for the calendar year 1981.\n\nHarrison's honorary titles also included Doctor of Laws at Queen's University, Kingston (1974), Corresponding Member of the [[American Musicological Society]] (1981), and Vice President and Chairman of the Plainsong and Medieval Music Society (1985). At Queen's also, the new Harrison-LeCaine Hall (1974) was partly named in his honour.<ref>''Queen's Encyclopedia'', as above.</ref>\n\nHarrison was married twice: with his first wife Nora he had two daughters. In 1965, he married the noted organologist [[Joan Rimmer]], with whom he collaborated in ethnomusicological fieldwork and its scholarly documentation in a number of common publications.<ref>Elliott (2013), p. 470.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1989, [[Harry White (musicologist)|Harry White]] appreciated Harrison as \"an Irish musicologist of international standing and of seminal influence, whose scholarly achievement, astonishingly, encompassed virtually the complete scope of the discipline which he espoused.\"<ref>Harry White: \"Frank Llewelyn Harrison and the Development of Postwar Musicological Thought\", in: ''Hermathena'', vol. 146 (1989), p. 40.</ref> David F.

Harrison\" (29 September 1905 \u2013 29 December 1987) was one of the leading [[Musicology|musicologists]] of his time and a pioneering [[Ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]]. Initially trained as an organist and composer, he turned to musicology in the early 1950s, first specialising in English and Irish music of the Middle Ages and increasingly turning to ethnomusicological subjects in the course of his career. His ''Music in Medieval Britain'' (1958) is still a standard work on the subject, and ''Time, Place and Music'' (1973) is a key textbook on ethnomusicology.\n\n==Education and early musical career==\nBorn in [[Dublin]], Ireland, Harrison was the second son of Alfred Francis Harrison and Florence May, n\u00e9e Nash. The Welsh origin of his second given name, \"Llewellyn\", derives from his maternal grandmother, a Williams from Anglesey.<ref>D. F. L. Chadd: \"Francis Llewellyn Harrison, 1905\u20131987\", in: ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' (1989), p. 361; see Bibliography.</ref> He became a chorister at [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] in 1912 and was educated at the cathedral grammar school (until 1920) and at [[Mountjoy School]] (1920\u20131922). A competent organist, he was deputy organist at St Patrick's from 1925 to 1928. In 1920, he also began musical studies at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]], where he studied with [[John F. Larchet]] (composition), George Hewson (organ) and [[Michele Esposito]] (piano). In 1926, he graduated Bachelor of Music at [[Trinity College Dublin]] and was awarded a doctorate (MusD) in 1929 for a musical setting of Psalm 19. He then worked in [[Kilkenny]] for one year, serving as organist at [[St Canice's Cathedral]] and music teacher at [[Kilkenny College]].<ref>Robin Elliott: \"Harrison, Frank [Francis] Llewellyn\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p. 469; see Bibliography.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Harrison emigrated to Canada to become organist at Westminster Presbyterian Church in [[New Glasgow, Nova Scotia]]. In 1933, he studied briefly with [[Marcel Dupr\u00e9]] in France, but returned to Canada in 1934 to become organist at [[Knox Presbyterian Church (Ottawa)|Knox Presbyterian Church]] in [[Ottawa]]. In 1935, he took a position as organist and choirmaster at [[St. George's Cathedral (Kingston, Ontario)|St. George's Cathedral]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], as well as taking up the newly created post of \"resident musician\" at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]]. His duties included \"giving lectures, running a choir and an orchestra, and conducting concerts himself. His course in the history and appreciation of music was the first music course to be given for full credit at Queen's.\"<ref>[https://www.queensu.ca/encyclopedia/h/harrison-frank ''Queen's Encyclopedia'']; retrieved 16 March 2020.</ref> He resigned from St. George's in 1941 to become assistant professor of music at Queen's in 1942. During his years in Canada he still pursued the idea of remaining a performing musician and composer, winning three national composition competitions: for ''Winter's Poem'' (1931), ''Baroque Suite'' (1943) and ''Night Hymns on Lake Nipigon'' (1945).<ref>Elliott (2013), p. 469.</ref>\n\nOn a year's leave of absence from Queen's Harrison studied composition with [[Paul Hindemith]] at [[Yale University]], also taking courses in musicology with [[Leo Schrade]]. In 1946, he took up a position at [[Colgate University]] in Hamilton, New York, and then moved on to [[Washington University in St. Louis]], as head of the new Department of Music (1947\u20131950).\n\n==Musicological career==\nIn 1951, Harrison took the degrees of Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Music (DMus) at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], and became lecturer (1952),  senior lecturer (1956), and reader in the history of music (1962\u201370) there. In 1965, he was elected Fellow the [[British Academy]] and Senior Research Fellow at Oxford. From 1970 to 1980, Harrison was Professor of Ethnomusicology at the [[University of Amsterdam]], the Netherlands, retiring to part-time teaching in 1976.\n\nHe also held Visiting Professorships in musicology at Yale University (1958\u20139), [[Princeton University]] (spring 1961 and 1968\u20139), and [[Dartmouth College]] (winter 1968 and spring 1972). He also briefly returned to Queen's University at Kingston as Queen's Quest Visiting Professor in the fall of 1980 and was Visiting Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Music at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] for the calendar year 1981.\n\nHarrison's honorary titles also included Doctor of Laws at Queen's University, Kingston (1974), Corresponding Member of the [[American Musicological Society]] (1981), and Vice President and Chairman of the Plainsong and Medieval Music Society (1985). At Queen's also, the new Harrison-LeCaine Hall (1974) was partly named in his honour.<ref>''Queen's Encyclopedia'', as above.</ref>\n\nHarrison was married twice: with his first wife Nora he had two daughters. In 1965, he married the noted organologist [[Joan Rimmer]], with whom he collaborated in ethnomusicological fieldwork and its scholarly documentation in a number of common publications.<ref>Elliott (2013), p. 470.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1989, Harry White appreciated Harrison as \"an Irish musicologist of international standing and of seminal influence, whose scholarly achievement, astonishingly, encompassed virtually the complete scope of the discipline which he espoused.\"<ref>Harry White: \"Frank Llewelyn Harrison and the Development of Postwar Musicological Thought\", in: ''Hermathena'', vol. 146 (1989), p. 40.</ref> David F. L. Chadd wrote of him \"He was above all things an explorer, tirelessly curious and boyishly delighted in the pursuit of knowledge, experience and ideas, and totally heedless of artificially imposed constraints and boundaries.\"<ref>Chadd (1989), p.&nbsp;380.</ref> \n\nSince 2004, the Society for Musicology in Ireland (SMI) awards an annual Harrison Medal in his honour to distinguished international musicologists.\n\n==Compositions==\n(all unpublished)\n\n* ''Psalm 19'' (1929) for choir and orchestra\n* ''Winter's Poem'' (1931) for organ\n* ''Concertino'' (1932) for piano and orchestra\n* ''Ode of Remembrance'' (1940) for choir\n* ''Baroque Suite'' (1943) for orchestra\n* ''Night Hymns on Lake Nipigon'' (c1944) for solo voice, chorus and orchestra\n* ''Sonata for Clarinet and Piano'' (1946) \n* ''Three Pieces for Clarinet and Piano'' (before 1948)\n* ''Two Preludes'' (before 1948) for piano\n* ''Homage to Spring'' (c.1950) for soprano and piano\n* other works for organ and piano\n\n==Music editions==\n* ''The Eton Choirbook'' (''[[Musica Britannica]]'', volumes 10\u201312) (London, 1956\u201361; second edition 1969\u201373).\n* ''[[John Sheppard (composer)|John Sheppard]]: Sechs Responsorien zu 4 und 6 Stimmen'' (''Das Chorwerk'', vol. 84) (Wolfenb\u00fcttel, 1960).\n* ''[[William Mundy (composer)|William Mundy]]: Latin Antiphons and Psalms'' (''Early English Church Music'', vol. 2) (London, 1963).\n* ''Motets of French Provenance'' (''Polyphonic Music of the Fourteenth Century'', vol. 5) (Monaco, 1968).\n* ''Now Make We Merth\u00eb: Medieval and Renaissance Carols'' (London, 1968).\n* (with E.

The aircraft's design incorporated a [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] [[duralumin]] metal skin as a strengthening measure, which was very unusual at the time. The Ju 52's [[maiden flight]] was performed on 13 October 1930. It was initially designed with a single engine, however, it was produced in quantity as a [[trimotor]]. The primary early production model, the ''Ju 52/3m'', was principally operated as a 17-seat airliner or utility transport aircraft by various civil operators during the 1930s. Following the rise of [[Nazi Germany]], thousands of Ju 52s were procured as a staple military transport of the nation. The ''Ju 52/3mg7e'' was the principal production model.\n\nThe Ju 52 was in production between 1931 and 1952. In a civilian role, it flew with over 12 airlines, including [[Swissair]] and [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]], as both a passenger carrier and a freight hauler. In a military role, large numbers flew with the [[Luftwaffe]], being deployed on virtually all fronts of the [[World War II|Second World War]] as a troop and cargo transport; it was also briefly used as a [[medium bomber]]. Additionally, the type was deployed by other nation's militaries in conflicts such as the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Chaco War]], and the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. During the [[postwar]] era, the Ju 52 had a lengthy service life with numerous military and civilian operators; large numbers were still in use by the 1980s. Even in the 21st century, several aircraft have remained operational, typically used for purposes such heritage aviation displays and aerial sightseeing.\n\n==Development==\nThe Ju 52 was similar to the company's previous [[Junkers W 33]], although larger. In 1930, German [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]] Ernst Zindel and his team designed the Ju 52 at the [[Junkers]] works at [[Dessau]]. According to aviation author J. Richard Smith, the Ju 52 directly drew upon the company's [[World War I|First World War]]-era [[Junkers J 1]] - the world's first all-metal aeroplane.<ref name = \"smith 3\">Smith 1966, p. 3.</ref>\n\nOn 13 October 1930, the first prototype, designated ''Ju 52ba'', performed the type's [[maiden flight]]; it was initially powered by a single Junkers-built liquid-cooled [[V12 engine|V-12]] engine, capable of generating up to 800hp.<ref name = \"smith 3\"/> During the aircraft's extensive trials, it was reengined with a 755hp [[BMW IV]] powerplant. The second prototype, designated ''Ju 52de'', featured an increased wing span and was powered by the BMW IV engine at first; it was soon reengined with the 750hp [[Armstrong Siddeley Leopard]] and re-designated ''Ju 52di''.<ref name = \"smith 3\"/> Later on, the Ju 52di was again reengined with the 750hp [[Junkers Jumo 204]], after which it was re-designated ''Ju 52do''. The third prototype, designated ''Ju 52ce'', had a strengthened structure, a modified [[leading edge]], and was fitted with both a wheeled and [[Float (nautical)|float]] [[landing gear|undercarriage]]s.<ref name = \"smith 3\"/>\n\nDuring May 1931, one of the prototypes, designated ''Ju 52cai'', was written off after a crash.<ref name = \"smith 34\">Smith 1966, pp. 3-4.</ref> While these initial aircraft had been powered by a single engine, Junkers decided to develop the Ju 52 into a [[trimotor]] configuration. Accordingly, the ''Ju 52/3m'' (''drei motoren''\u2014\"three engines\") was developed, being powered by an arrangement of three [[radial engine]]s.<ref name = \"smith 4\"/> According to Smith, the earliest known Ju 52/3m was delivered to [[Bolivia]]n airline [[Lloyd A\u00e9reo Boliviano]] during 1932. During its initial production years, airlines were the type's most common customers.<ref name = \"smith 4\"/> By the mid-1930s, the ''Ju 52/3mce'' and ''Ju 52/3fe'', were the two primary production variants, both being powered by the [[BMW 132]] radial engine.<ref name = \"smith 4\">Smith 1966, p. 4.</ref>\n\nDuring 1934, work commenced on a militarised model of the Ju 52/3m, designated ''Ju 52/3mg3e'', on behalf of the then-secret [[Luftwaffe]].<ref name = \"smith 5\"/> This model could function as a [[medium bomber]], being furnished with a pair of [[Gun_turret#Aircraft|defensive gun turret]]s and operated by a crew of four. Between 1934 and 1935, a total of 450 Ju 52/3mg3e aircraft were delivered to the Luftwaffe.<ref name = \"smith 5\"/>\n\nNumerous improved models would be introduced prior to and during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The dominant production model was the ''Ju 52/3mg7e'', featuring advances such as an [[autopilot]], enlarged doors to the cabin, and other general enhancements.<ref name = \"smith 6\"/> It was configured as a pure transport aircraft, being capable of carrying up to 18 fully-equipped troops. Defensive armaments comprised a dorsal-mounted 13 mm [[MG 131 machine gun]] and a pair of sideways-mounted 7.9mm [[MG 15]] [[machine gun]]s.<ref name = \"smith 6\">Smith 1966, p. 6.</ref> Successive models saw other improvements, such as revised glazing, newer engines, undercarriage strengthening, and increased take-off weight. The final wartime model to be developed, designated ''Ju 52/3mg14e'', featured improved armour protection for the pilot and a bolstered defensive armament.<ref name = \"smith 67\">Smith 1966, pp. 6-7.</ref>\n\nFrom mid-1943 onwards, the Luftwaffe began to make less use of the Ju 52, interest having waned in the type.<ref name = \"smith 13\"/> German officials were interested in procuring a successor to the type; at one stage, the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|Reich Air Ministry]] showed enthusiasm for the [[Junkers Ju 352]], a larger transport aircraft somewhat resembling the Ju 52. Actions were taken to convert Junkers' Ju 52 production lines to instead manufacture Ju 352s; however, [[Victory in Europe Day|the conflict's end in May 1945]] led to the effort being abandoned in an unfinished state.<ref name = \"smith 13\">Smith 1966, p. 13.</ref> As such, German production of the Ju 52 was terminated during 1944; Smith claims that a total of 3,234 aircraft of various models were constructed during the conflict.<ref name = \"smith 7\">Smith 1966, p. 7.</ref>\n\nIn the [[postwar]] era, manufacture of the Ju 52 resumed, albeit in foreign countries.<ref name = \"smith 13\"/> It was constructed in France by [[Avions Amiot]] as the ''Amiot AAC.1 Toucan''; it was also produced in Spain by [[CASA (aircraft manufacturer)|Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA]] (CASA) as the ''CASA 352''. A handful of captured wartime aircraft were also rebuilt by [[Short Brothers]] of [[Northern Ireland]] for civilian service.<ref name = \"smith 13\"/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Junkers Ju 52-3mg2.jpg|thumb|right|Lufthansa's 21st-century airworthy heritage Ju 52/3mg2e (Wk-Nr 5489) in flight, showing the ''Doppelfl\u00fcgel'', \"double wing\" trailing-edge control surfaces]]\n\nThe Ju 52 had a low [[Cantilever#Aircraft|cantilever]] wing, the midsection of which was built into the [[fuselage]], forming its underside.<ref>Grey and Bridgman 1972, {{page needed||date=February 2020}}.</ref><ref name = \"smith 3\"/> It was formed around four pairs of circular cross-section duralumin [[Spar (aeronautics)|spar]]s with a corrugated surface that provided torsional stiffening. A narrow control surface, with its outer section functioning as the [[aileron]], and the inner section functioning as a [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]], ran along the whole [[trailing edge]] of each wing panel, well separated from it. The inner flap section lowered the stalling speed and the arrangement became known as the ''Doppelfl\u00fcgel'', or \"double wing\".<ref name=\"Jackson 1960, p. 100.\">Jackson 1960, p. 100.</ref><ref name = \"smith 3\"/>\n\nThe outer sections of this operated differentially as [[aileron]]s, projecting slightly beyond the wingtips with control horns. The strutted [[Tailplane|horizontal stabilizer]] carried horn-balanced [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]]s which again projected and showed a significant gap between them and the stabilizer, which was adjustable in-flight. All stabilizer surfaces were corrugated.\n\n[[File:JU 52.svg|thumb|Junkers Ju 52]]\n\nThe Ju 52 featured an unusual [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] [[duralumin]] metal skin, which had been pioneered by Junkers during the [[Junkers D.I|First World War]]; the corrugation served to strengthen the whole structure over a smoother approach.<ref name = \"smith 3\"/> The fuselage was of rectangular section with a domed decking, comprising a tubular steel structure that was entirely covered by the corrugated metal skin.<ref name = \"smith 3\"/> A port-side passenger door was placed just aft of the wings; this entrance also acted as a loading hatch for freight, the lower half functioning as a platform to ease cargo movements. The cabin had a dimensional capacity of 590 cubic feet, and was lined with numerous windows stretching forward to the pilots' [[cockpit]].<ref name = \"smith 3\"/> The main [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] was fixed and divided; some aircraft had wheel [[Aircraft fairing|fairing]]s, others did not. A fixed tailskid, or a later tailwheel, was used. Some aircraft were fitted with floats or skis instead of the main wheels.<ref name = \"smith 4\"/>\n\nIn its original configuration, designated the ''Ju 52/1m'', the Ju 52 was a single-engined aircraft, powered by either a [[BMW IV]] or Junkers liquid-cooled [[V12 engine|V-12]] engine. However, the single-engined model was deemed to been underpowered and, after seven [[prototype]]s had been completed, all subsequent Ju 52s were built with three [[radial engine]]s as the ''Ju 52/3m'' (''drei motoren''\u2014\"three engines\"). Originally powered by three [[Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet]] radial engines, later production models mainly received 574&nbsp;kW (770&nbsp;hp) [[BMW 132]] engines, a licence-built refinement of the Pratt & Whitney design. Export models were also built with 447&nbsp;kW (600&nbsp;hp) [[Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp]] and 578&nbsp;kW (775&nbsp;hp) [[Bristol Pegasus]] VI engines.\n\nThe two wing-mounted radial engines of the Ju 52/3m had half-[[Chord (aeronautics)|chord]] [[cowling]]s and in planform view (from above/below) appeared to be splayed outwards, being mounted at an almost perpendicular angle to the tapered wing's sweptback leading edge (in a similar fashion to the [[Mitsubishi G3M]] bomber and [[Short Sunderland]]; the angled engines on the Ju 52 were intended to make maintaining straight flight easier should an engine fail, while the others had different reasons). The three engines had either [[Townend ring]] or NACA cowlings to reduce drag from the engine cylinders, although a mixture of the two was most common (as can be seen in many of the accompanying photographs), with deeper-chord NACA cowlings on the wing engines and a narrow Townend ring on the center engine (onto which a deeper NACA cowl was more difficult to fit, due to the widening fuselage behind the engine). Production Ju 52/3m aircraft flown by [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] before the Second World War, as well as Luftwaffe-flown Ju 52s flown during the war, usually used an [[air-start system]] to turn over their trio of radial engines, using a common compressed air supply that also operated the main wheels' brakes.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn a military context, the Ju 52 could carry up to 18 fully-equipped soldiers, or 12 stretchers when used as an [[Air medical services|air ambulance]]. Transported material was loaded and unloaded through side doors by means of a ramp. Air-dropped supplies were jettisoned through two double chutes; supply containers were dropped by parachute through the bomb-bay doors, and paratroopers jumped through the side doors. [[Sd.Kfz. 2|Sd.Kfz. 2 ''Kettenkraftr\u00e4der'']] (half-track motorcycles) and supply canisters for parachute troops were secured under the fuselage at the bomb bay exits and were dropped with four parachutes. A tow coupling was built into the tail-skid for use in towing freight [[Military glider|gliders]]. The Ju 52 could tow up to two [[DFS 230]] gliders.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Junkers Ju-52 single-engine.JPG|thumb|Ju 52/1m replica (converted from 52/3m) of \"CF-ARM\" at the [[Royal Aviation Museum of Western Canada]], Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-166-0512-39, Kreta, Abgest\u00fcrzte Ju 52.jpg|thumb|Ju 52s damaged in [[Battle of Crete|Crete]], 1941]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-026-0122-32A, Griechenland, Kreta, Ju 52.jpg|thumb|A [[Luftwaffe]] Ju 52 being serviced in Crete in 1943: Note the narrow-chord [[Townend ring]] on the central engine and the deeper-chord [[NACA cowling]]s on the wing engines.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-670-7410-10, Fallschirmj\u00e4gerabsprung aus Junkers Ju 52.jpg|thumb|Luftwaffe Ju 52s dropping paratroops]]\n[[File:MG-15 ammo Ju-52.jpg|thumb|Internal view of Ju 52 showing a defensive [[MG 15]] beam machine gun and storage mounts for spare saddle-drum magazines]]\n[[File:Junkers Ju 52 cockpit.jpg|thumb|Junkers Ju 52 cockpit layout]]\n\n===Prewar civil use===\nIn late 1931, [[James Armstrong Richardson, Sr.|James A.

It was one of the first aircraft to be delivered to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]] in July 1936. According to Smith, the Ju 52 gained a formidable reputation; the type having been reportedly used in practically every major military engagement in support of Nationalist forces.<ref name = \"smith 56\"/> In the Spanish theatre, the Ju 52 was operated both as a bomber and as a transport. In the former role, it participated in the [[bombing of Guernica]], although it was considered obsolete as a bomber by late 1937, by which point it was in the process of being replaced by more capable bombers such as the Dornier Do 17 and Heinkel He 111.<ref name = \"smith 56\">Smith 1966, pp. 5-6.</ref> The type's final sortie in the theatre was performed on 26 March 1939.

The Luftwaffe instead relied on the Ju 52 for transport roles during the Second World War, including [[Paratrooper|paratroop]] drops.\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring its service with Luft Hansa, the Ju 52 had proved to be an extremely reliable passenger airplane. This positive experience contributed to its adoption by the Luftwaffe as a standard aircraft model. In 1938, the [[German 7th Flieger Division|7th Air Division]] had five air transport groups with 250 Ju 52s. The Luftwaffe had 552 Ju 52s at the start of the Second World War. Though it was built in great numbers, the Ju 52 was technically obsolete. Between 1939 and 1944, 2,804 Ju 52s were delivered to the Luftwaffe (1939: 145; 1940: 388; 1941: 502; 1942: 503; 1943: 887; and 1944: 379). The production of Ju 52s continued until around the summer of 1944; when the war came to an end, 100 to 200 were still available.\n\nLightly armed, and with a top speed of only 265&nbsp;km/h (165&nbsp;mph) \u2013 half that of a contemporary [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] \u2013 the Ju 52 was very vulnerable to fighter attack, and an escort was always necessary when flying in a combat zone.

It was during this campaign that the Ju 52  performed a crucial role in carrying out the first large-scale air attack with [[paratroop]]s in history during the [[Battle for The Hague]].<ref name = \"smith 10\"/> According to Smith, 500 Ju 52s had been made ready for the aerial assault on the [[Low Countries]]. In addition to the paratroop drops, they also directly landed in hostile territory to deploy assault troops, such as at [[Ypenburg Airport]], on public highways around [[The Hague]], and on the [[Meuse|River Meuse]] (the latter using float-equipped aircraft).<ref name = \"smith 1011\">Smith 1966, pp. 10-11.</ref>\n\nDuring the opening days of the Netherlands campaign, many German aircraft were shot down by Dutch AA-fire; a total of 125 Ju 52s were lost and 47 damaged; author Hooton considered these losses to have been relatively costly for the Luftwaffe.<ref>E.R Hooton. \"Luftwaffe at War: Blitzkrieg in the West.\" 2007, Vol. 2, p. 50.</ref> Although transport operations with the Ju 52 were noticeably curtailed after the initial days of the invasion, the type continued to aerially supply forward ground troops.<ref name = \"smith 11\">Smith 1966, p. 11.</ref>\n\nDuring August 1940, Nazi German decided to base large numbers of Ju 52s at airfields in the [[Lyon]], [[Lille]], and [[Arras]] areas.<ref>Page 50, \"German Air Force Air Lift Operations\", by GeneralMajor Fritz Morzik, USAF Historical Division, 1961.</ref> Luftwaffe transport units were deliberately held at a state of readiness for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the envisioned invasion of the British Isles; however,this operation was never attempted, in part due to the Luftwaffe being unable to secure aerial supremacy during the [[Battle of Britain]].<ref name = \"smith 11\"/>\n\n[[File:Ju_52_approaching_Stalingrad_late_1942.jpg|thumb|right|A Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad, 1942]]\n\n====Balkans campaign====\nThe next major use of the Ju 52 was in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans campaign]]. The type has been credited with enabling the rapid deployment of German ground forces throughout the theatre.<ref name = \"smith 11\"/> However, the Ju 52 was perhaps most famously deployed during the [[Battle of Crete]] in late May 1941. 493 Ju 52/3m aircraft were used to transport much of the 22,750 troops flown onto Crete for the Luftwaffe's largest airborne invasion of the war.<ref name = \"smith 11\"/> While victorious, 170 aircraft were lost along with 4,500 personnel; the high loss rate brought about the end of German paratroop operations.<ref name = \"smith 11\"/>\n\n====North Africa campaign====\nDuring the [[North African campaign]], the Ju 52 was the mainstay reinforcement and resupply transport for the Germans, starting with 20 to 50 flights a day to [[Tunisia]] from [[Sicily]] in November 1942, building to 150 landings a day in early April as the Axis situation became more desperate. The Allied air forces developed a counter-air operation over a two-month period and implemented [[Operation Flax]] on 5 April 1943, destroying 11 Ju 52s in the air near [[Cap Bon]] and many more during bombing attacks on its Sicilian airfields, leaving only 29 flyable.<ref>Craven and Cate 1949, pp. 189\u2013190</ref> That began two catastrophic weeks in which more than 140 aircraft were lost in air interceptions,<ref>Craven and Cate 1949, pp. 190\u2013191</ref> culminating on 18 April with the [[Operation Flax#Palm Sunday Massacre|\"Palm Sunday Massacre\"]] in which 24 Ju 52s were shot down, and another 35 staggered back to Sicily and crash-landed.<ref>Weal 2003, p. 91.</ref><ref name = \"smith 12\">Smith 1966, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Hitler's personal transport===\n{{main|Hans Baur#Die Fliegerstaffel des Fuehrers}}\n\nHitler used a Deutsche Luft Hansa Ju 52 for campaigning in the 1932 German election, preferring flying to train travel. After he became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, [[Hans Baur]] became his personal pilot, and Hitler was provided with a personal Ju 52.

In September 1939, at Baur's suggestion, ''Immelmann II'' was replaced by a four-engine [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Focke-Wulf Fw 200 ''Condor'']], although ''Immelman II'' remained his backup aircraft for the rest of the Second World War.\n\n===Chiang Kai-shek's personal transport===\n[[File:Ju52 airliner Eurasia.jpg|thumb|right|A Ju 52 of Eurasia, 1930s in China]]\n[[Eurasia Aviation Corporation|Eurasia]] was the main Chinese Airliner Company in the 1930s and the Ju 52 was their main airliner plane.

The aircraft's design incorporated a [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] [[duralumin]] metal skin as a strengthening measure, which was very unusual at the time. The Ju 52's [[maiden flight]] was performed on 13 October 1930. It was initially designed with a single engine, however, it was produced in quantity as a [[trimotor]]. The primary early production model, the ''Ju 52/3m'', was principally operated as a 17-seat airliner or utility transport aircraft by various civil operators during the 1930s. Following the rise of [[Nazi Germany]], thousands of Ju 52s were procured as a staple military transport of the nation. The ''Ju 52/3mg7e'' was the principal production model.\n\nThe Ju 52 was in production between 1931 and 1952. In a civilian role, it flew with over 12 airlines, including [[Swissair]] and [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]], as both a passenger carrier and a freight hauler. In a military role, large numbers flew with the [[Luftwaffe]], being deployed on virtually all fronts of the [[World War II|Second World War]] as a troop and cargo transport; it was also briefly used as a [[medium bomber]]. Additionally, the type was deployed by other nation's militaries in conflicts such as the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Chaco War]], and the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. During the [[postwar]] era, the Ju 52 had a lengthy service life with numerous military and civilian operators; large numbers were still in use by the 1980s. Even in the 21st century, several aircraft have remained operational, typically used for purposes such heritage aviation displays and aerial sightseeing.\n\n==Development==\nThe Ju 52 was similar to the company's previous [[Junkers W 33]], although larger. In 1930, German [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]] Ernst Zindel and his team designed the Ju 52 at the [[Junkers]] works at [[Dessau]]. According to aviation author J. Richard Smith, the Ju 52 directly drew upon the company's [[World War I|First World War]]-era [[Junkers J 1]] - the world's first all-metal aeroplane.<ref name = \"smith 3\">Smith 1966, p. 3.</ref>\n\nOn 13 October 1930, the first prototype, designated ''Ju 52ba'', performed the type's [[maiden flight]]; it was initially powered by a single Junkers-built liquid-cooled [[V12 engine|V-12]] engine, capable of generating up to 800hp.<ref name = \"smith 3\"/> During the aircraft's extensive trials, it was reengined with a 755hp [[BMW IV]] powerplant. The second prototype, designated ''Ju 52de'', featured an increased wing span and was powered by the BMW IV engine at first; it was soon reengined with the 750hp [[Armstrong Siddeley Leopard]] and re-designated ''Ju 52di''.<ref name = \"smith 3\"/> Later on, the Ju 52di was again reengined with the 750hp [[Junkers Jumo 204]], after which it was re-designated ''Ju 52do''. The third prototype, designated ''Ju 52ce'', had a strengthened structure, a modified [[leading edge]], and was fitted with both a wheeled and [[Float (nautical)|float]] [[landing gear|undercarriage]]s.<ref name = \"smith 3\"/>\n\nDuring May 1931, one of the prototypes, designated ''Ju 52cai'', was written off after a crash.<ref name = \"smith 34\">Smith 1966, pp. 3-4.</ref> While these initial aircraft had been powered by a single engine, Junkers decided to develop the Ju 52 into a [[trimotor]] configuration. Accordingly, the ''Ju 52/3m'' (''drei motoren''\u2014\"three engines\") was developed, being powered by an arrangement of three [[radial engine]]s.<ref name = \"smith 4\"/> According to Smith, the earliest known Ju 52/3m was delivered to [[Bolivia]]n airline [[Lloyd A\u00e9reo Boliviano]] during 1932. During its initial production years, airlines were the type's most common customers.<ref name = \"smith 4\"/> By the mid-1930s, the ''Ju 52/3mce'' and ''Ju 52/3fe'', were the two primary production variants, both being powered by the [[BMW 132]] radial engine.<ref name = \"smith 4\">Smith 1966, p. 4.</ref>\n\nDuring 1934, work commenced on a militarised model of the Ju 52/3m, designated ''Ju 52/3mg3e'', on behalf of the then-secret [[Luftwaffe]].<ref name = \"smith 5\"/> This model could function as a [[medium bomber]], being furnished with a pair of [[Gun_turret#Aircraft|defensive gun turret]]s and operated by a crew of four. Between 1934 and 1935, a total of 450 Ju 52/3mg3e aircraft were delivered to the Luftwaffe.<ref name = \"smith 5\"/>\n\nNumerous improved models would be introduced prior to and during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The dominant production model was the ''Ju 52/3mg7e'', featuring advances such as an [[autopilot]], enlarged doors to the cabin, and other general enhancements.<ref name = \"smith 6\"/> It was configured as a pure transport aircraft, being capable of carrying up to 18 fully-equipped troops. Defensive armaments comprised a dorsal-mounted 13 mm [[MG 131 machine gun]] and a pair of sideways-mounted 7.9mm [[MG 15]] [[machine gun]]s.<ref name = \"smith 6\">Smith 1966, p. 6.</ref> Successive models saw other improvements, such as revised glazing, newer engines, undercarriage strengthening, and increased take-off weight. The final wartime model to be developed, designated ''Ju 52/3mg14e'', featured improved armour protection for the pilot and a bolstered defensive armament.<ref name = \"smith 67\">Smith 1966, pp. 6-7.</ref>\n\nFrom mid-1943 onwards, the Luftwaffe began to make less use of the Ju 52, interest having waned in the type.<ref name = \"smith 13\"/> German officials were interested in procuring a successor to the type; at one stage, the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|Reich Air Ministry]] showed enthusiasm for the [[Junkers Ju 352]], a larger transport aircraft somewhat resembling the Ju 52. Actions were taken to convert Junkers' Ju 52 production lines to instead manufacture Ju 352s; however, [[Victory in Europe Day|the conflict's end in May 1945]] led to the effort being abandoned in an unfinished state.<ref name = \"smith 13\">Smith 1966, p. 13.</ref> As such, German production of the Ju 52 was terminated during 1944; Smith claims that a total of 3,234 aircraft of various models were constructed during the conflict.<ref name = \"smith 7\">Smith 1966, p. 7.</ref>\n\nIn the [[postwar]] era, manufacture of the Ju 52 resumed, albeit in foreign countries.<ref name = \"smith 13\"/> It was constructed in France by [[Avions Amiot]] as the ''Amiot AAC.1 Toucan''; it was also produced in Spain by [[CASA (aircraft manufacturer)|Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA]] (CASA) as the ''CASA 352''. A handful of captured wartime aircraft were also rebuilt by [[Short Brothers]] of [[Northern Ireland]] for civilian service.<ref name = \"smith 13\"/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Junkers Ju 52-3mg2.jpg|thumb|right|Lufthansa's 21st-century airworthy heritage Ju 52/3mg2e (Wk-Nr 5489) in flight, showing the ''Doppelfl\u00fcgel'', \"double wing\" trailing-edge control surfaces]]\n\nThe Ju 52 had a low [[Cantilever#Aircraft|cantilever]] wing, the midsection of which was built into the [[fuselage]], forming its underside.<ref>Grey and Bridgman 1972, {{page needed||date=February 2020}}.</ref><ref name = \"smith 3\"/> It was formed around four pairs of circular cross-section duralumin [[Spar (aeronautics)|spar]]s with a corrugated surface that provided torsional stiffening. A narrow control surface, with its outer section functioning as the [[aileron]], and the inner section functioning as a [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]], ran along the whole [[trailing edge]] of each wing panel, well separated from it. The inner flap section lowered the stalling speed and the arrangement became known as the ''Doppelfl\u00fcgel'', or \"double wing\".<ref name=\"Jackson 1960, p. 100.\">Jackson 1960, p. 100.</ref><ref name = \"smith 3\"/>\n\nThe outer sections of this operated differentially as [[aileron]]s, projecting slightly beyond the wingtips with control horns. The strutted [[Tailplane|horizontal stabilizer]] carried horn-balanced [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]]s which again projected and showed a significant gap between them and the stabilizer, which was adjustable in-flight. All stabilizer surfaces were corrugated.\n\n[[File:JU 52.svg|thumb|Junkers Ju 52]]\n\nThe Ju 52 featured an unusual [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] [[duralumin]] metal skin, which had been pioneered by Junkers during the [[Junkers D.I|First World War]]; the corrugation served to strengthen the whole structure over a smoother approach.<ref name = \"smith 3\"/> The fuselage was of rectangular section with a domed decking, comprising a tubular steel structure that was entirely covered by the corrugated metal skin.<ref name = \"smith 3\"/> A port-side passenger door was placed just aft of the wings; this entrance also acted as a loading hatch for freight, the lower half functioning as a platform to ease cargo movements. The cabin had a dimensional capacity of 590 cubic feet, and was lined with numerous windows stretching forward to the pilots' [[cockpit]].<ref name = \"smith 3\"/> The main [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] was fixed and divided; some aircraft had wheel [[Aircraft fairing|fairing]]s, others did not. A fixed tailskid, or a later tailwheel, was used. Some aircraft were fitted with floats or skis instead of the main wheels.<ref name = \"smith 4\"/>\n\nIn its original configuration, designated the ''Ju 52/1m'', the Ju 52 was a single-engined aircraft, powered by either a [[BMW IV]] or Junkers liquid-cooled [[V12 engine|V-12]] engine. However, the single-engined model was deemed to been underpowered and, after seven [[prototype]]s had been completed, all subsequent Ju 52s were built with three [[radial engine]]s as the ''Ju 52/3m'' (''drei motoren''\u2014\"three engines\"). Originally powered by three [[Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet]] radial engines, later production models mainly received 574&nbsp;kW (770&nbsp;hp) [[BMW 132]] engines, a licence-built refinement of the Pratt & Whitney design. Export models were also built with 447&nbsp;kW (600&nbsp;hp) [[Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp]] and 578&nbsp;kW (775&nbsp;hp) [[Bristol Pegasus]] VI engines.\n\nThe two wing-mounted radial engines of the Ju 52/3m had half-[[Chord (aeronautics)|chord]] [[cowling]]s and in planform view (from above/below) appeared to be splayed outwards, being mounted at an almost perpendicular angle to the tapered wing's sweptback leading edge (in a similar fashion to the [[Mitsubishi G3M]] bomber and [[Short Sunderland]]; the angled engines on the Ju 52 were intended to make maintaining straight flight easier should an engine fail, while the others had different reasons). The three engines had either [[Townend ring]] or NACA cowlings to reduce drag from the engine cylinders, although a mixture of the two was most common (as can be seen in many of the accompanying photographs), with deeper-chord NACA cowlings on the wing engines and a narrow Townend ring on the center engine (onto which a deeper NACA cowl was more difficult to fit, due to the widening fuselage behind the engine). Production Ju 52/3m aircraft flown by [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] before the Second World War, as well as Luftwaffe-flown Ju 52s flown during the war, usually used an [[air-start system]] to turn over their trio of radial engines, using a common compressed air supply that also operated the main wheels' brakes.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn a military context, the Ju 52 could carry up to 18 fully-equipped soldiers, or 12 stretchers when used as an [[Air medical services|air ambulance]]. Transported material was loaded and unloaded through side doors by means of a ramp. Air-dropped supplies were jettisoned through two double chutes; supply containers were dropped by parachute through the bomb-bay doors, and paratroopers jumped through the side doors. [[Sd.Kfz. 2|Sd.Kfz. 2 ''Kettenkraftr\u00e4der'']] (half-track motorcycles) and supply canisters for parachute troops were secured under the fuselage at the bomb bay exits and were dropped with four parachutes. A tow coupling was built into the tail-skid for use in towing freight [[Military glider|gliders]]. The Ju 52 could tow up to two [[DFS 230]] gliders.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Junkers Ju-52 single-engine.JPG|thumb|Ju 52/1m replica (converted from 52/3m) of \"CF-ARM\" at the [[Royal Aviation Museum of Western Canada]], Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-166-0512-39, Kreta, Abgest\u00fcrzte Ju 52.jpg|thumb|Ju 52s damaged in [[Battle of Crete|Crete]], 1941]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-026-0122-32A, Griechenland, Kreta, Ju 52.jpg|thumb|A [[Luftwaffe]] Ju 52 being serviced in Crete in 1943: Note the narrow-chord [[Townend ring]] on the central engine and the deeper-chord [[NACA cowling]]s on the wing engines.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-670-7410-10, Fallschirmj\u00e4gerabsprung aus Junkers Ju 52.jpg|thumb|Luftwaffe Ju 52s dropping paratroops]]\n[[File:MG-15 ammo Ju-52.jpg|thumb|Internal view of Ju 52 showing a defensive [[MG 15]] beam machine gun and storage mounts for spare saddle-drum magazines]]\n[[File:Junkers Ju 52 cockpit.jpg|thumb|Junkers Ju 52 cockpit layout]]\n\n===Prewar civil use===\nIn late 1931, [[James Armstrong Richardson, Sr.|James A.

The Luftwaffe instead relied on the Ju 52 for transport roles during the Second World War, including [[Paratrooper|paratroop]] drops.\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring its service with Luft Hansa, the Ju 52 had proved to be an extremely reliable passenger airplane. This positive experience contributed to its adoption by the Luftwaffe as a standard aircraft model. In 1938, the [[German 7th Flieger Division|7th Air Division]] had five air transport groups with 250 Ju 52s. The Luftwaffe had 552 Ju 52s at the start of the Second World War. Though it was built in great numbers, the Ju 52 was technically obsolete. Between 1939 and 1944, 2,804 Ju 52s were delivered to the Luftwaffe (1939: 145; 1940: 388; 1941: 502; 1942: 503; 1943: 887; and 1944: 379). The production of Ju 52s continued until around the summer of 1944; when the war came to an end, 100 to 200 were still available.\n\nLightly armed, and with a top speed of only 265&nbsp;km/h (165&nbsp;mph) \u2013 half that of a contemporary [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] \u2013 the Ju 52 was very vulnerable to fighter attack, and an escort was always necessary when flying in a combat zone. Many Ju 52's were shot down by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|antiaircraft gun]]s and fighters while transporting supplies, most notably during the desperate attempt to resupply the trapped [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Sixth Army]] during the final stages of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in the winter of 1942\u20131943.<ref name = \"smith 112\">Smith 1966, pp. 11-12.</ref>\n\nFrom 24 November 1942 to 31 January 1943, 488 aircraft were recorded as lost (this number included 266 Ju&nbsp;52, 165 He&nbsp;111, 42 Ju&nbsp;86, 9 Fw&nbsp;200, 5 He&nbsp;177 and 1 Ju&nbsp;290) and about 1,000 flight personnel.<ref>Morzik F. \"German Air Force Airlift Operations.\" ''USAAF Historical division'', 1961. p. 195.</ref>\n\n====Denmark and Norway campaign====\n\nThe first major operation for the aircraft after the bombing of Warsaw was in [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the attack on Denmark and Norway on 9 April 1940.

It was developed in [[Nazi Germany]] and used extensively by the [[Axis powers]] during [[World War II]].\n\nDesigned in 1938 by [[Heinrich Vollmer]] with inspiration from its predecessor the '''MP 38''', it was heavily used by [[infantry]]men (particularly [[platoon]] and [[squad]] leaders), and by [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|paratroopers]], on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|Western]] Fronts. Its advanced and modern features made it a favorite among soldiers and popular in countries from various parts of the world after the war. It was often called \"Schmeisser\" by the Allies, after [[Hugo Schmeisser]] who designed the [[MP 18]], although he was not involved in the design or production of the MP40. The weapon's other variants included '''MP 40/I''' and the '''MP 41'''. From 1940 to 1945, an estimated 1.1 million were produced by [[Erma Werke]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-278-0899-26, Russland, Soldat mit MP 40 im Schnee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Willy Zimmermann]], a highly decorated German [[Unteroffizier]], with an MP 40 on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in 1944|alt=]]\n\nThe ''Maschinenpistole 40'' (\"Machine pistol 40\") descended from its predecessor the MP 38, which was in turn based on the MP 36, a prototype made of machined steel.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=13}} The MP 36 was developed independently by [[Erma Werke]]'s Berthold Geipel with funding from the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. It took design elements from [[Heinrich Vollmer]]'s VPM 1930 and [[ERMA EMP-35|EMP]]. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype to answer a request from the ''[[Heereswaffenamt]]'' (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 36, and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38, with certain cost-saving alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=13}}\n\nThe MP 40 was often called the \"Schmeisser\" by the Allies, after the weapon designer [[Hugo Schmeisser]]. Schmeisser had designed the [[MP 18]], which was the first mass-produced submachine gun. He did not, however, have anything to do with the design or development of the MP 40, although he held a patent on the magazine.{{sfn|Rottman|2012|p=9}}\n\n==Design==\nThe MP 40 submachine guns are [[open-bolt]], [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]]-operated [[Automatic firearm|automatic]] arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but the relatively low rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls.{{sfn|Peterson|2011|p=314}} The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide which serves as a pneumatic recoil buffer.{{sfn|Peterson|2011|p=314}} The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=259}} It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=259}} The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop that were used to hold the bolt in the forward position.{{sfn|World Guns}}\n\nThe MP 38 receiver was made of machined steel, but this was a time-consuming and expensive process.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}} To save time and materials, and thus increase production, construction of the MP 40 receiver was simplified by using stamped steel and electro-[[spot welding]] as much as possible.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}} The MP 38 also features longitudinal grooving on the receiver and bolt, as well as a circular opening on the magazine housing. These features were eliminated on the MP 40.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-198-1394-06A, Russland, Soldat mit MP.jpg|thumb|left|A soldier of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] with an MP 38 in 1943|alt=]]\n\nOne unique feature found on most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or [[bakelite]] resting bar or support under the barrel. This was used to steady the weapon when firing over the side of open-top [[armored personnel carrier]]s such as the [[Sd.Kfz. 251]] [[half-track]]. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip.{{sfn|Hobart|1975|pp=95\u201398}} The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned.{{sfn|Hobart|1975|pp=95\u201398}} The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=90}} However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=90}}\n\nAlthough the MP 40 was generally reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert found on the [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson M1921/1928 variants]], the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated by the presence of dirt or other debris.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}} This could cause the weapon to [[Firearm malfunction|malfunction]] when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips to move out of the line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}} German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}}\n\n==Usage==\nAt the outbreak of World War II, the majority of German soldiers carried either [[Karabiner 98k]] rifles or MP 40s, both of which were regarded as the standard weapons of choice for an infantryman.{{sfn|Neil|2015|p=65}}\n\nHowever, later confrontations with Soviet troops such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], where entire enemy units were armed with [[PPSh-41]] submachine guns, the Germans found themselves out-gunned in short range urban combat which caused a shift in their tactics, and by the end of the war the MP 40 and its derivatives were being issued to entire assault platoons on a limited basis.{{sfn|Priestley|Cavatore|2014|pp=105\u2013108}} Starting in 1943, the German military moved to replace both the Karabiner 98k rifle and MP 40 with the new, revolutionary [[StG 44]].{{sfn|Priestley|Cavatore|2014|pp=105\u2013108}}{{sfn|Neil|2015|p=65}} By the end of World War II in 1945, an estimated 1.1 million MP 40s had been produced of all variants.{{sfn|Willbanks|2004|p=82}}\n\n===Post-war usage===\nDuring and after the end of World War II, many MP 40s were captured or surrendered (upwards of 200,000) to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and were then redistributed to the paramilitary and irregular forces of some developing countries.{{sfn|Ingram|2001|p=75}} The Norwegian army withdrew the MP 38 from use in 1975 but used the MP 40 for some years more. In particular, the Territorials ([[Home Guard (Norway)|Heimevernet]]) used it until about 1990, when it was replaced by the [[Heckler & Koch MP5]].{{sfn|World Guns}}\n\n==Variants==\n===MP 40/I===\nThe MP 40/I (sometimes erroneously called ''MP 40/II'') was a modified version of the standard MP 40 with a dual side-by-side magazine holder (for a theoretical ammunition total of 64 rounds), designed for special operations troops on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to compensate for the enemies' PPSh-41 larger magazine capacity. However, the design proved unsuccessful due to weight and reliability issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===MP 41===\n[[File:German MP wooden stock.jpg|thumb|An MP 41 with wooden stock|alt=]]\nIn 1941, Hugo Schmeisser designed the MP 41, which was, in reality, an MP 40 upper receiver with a lower receiver of an [[MP 18|MP 28]] submachine gun. It saw limited service, however, and was issued only to [[SS]] and police units in 1944. The MP 41 was also supplied to Germany's [[Axis Powers|Axis ally]] Romania.{{sfn|Axworthy|1991|p=42}}\n\n===Zastava M56===\n[[File:Brzostrelka M56.jpg|thumb|A Zastava M56|alt=]]\nA clone of the MP40 developed in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after the war, the [[Zastava M56]] differs from the MP40 by the increased barrel length, curved magazine, and [[7.62x25mm Tokarev|cartridge]], which allows for better penetration than the MP40.

(''Maschinenpistole 40'') is a [[submachine gun]] chambered for the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] cartridge. It was developed in [[Nazi Germany]] and used extensively by the [[Axis powers]] during [[World War II]].\n\nDesigned in 1938 by [[Heinrich Vollmer]] with inspiration from its predecessor the '''MP 38''', it was heavily used by [[infantry]]men (particularly [[platoon]] and [[squad]] leaders), and by [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger|paratroopers]], on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|Western]] Fronts. Its advanced and modern features made it a favorite among soldiers and popular in countries from various parts of the world after the war. It was often called \"Schmeisser\" by the Allies, after [[Hugo Schmeisser]] who designed the [[MP 18]], although he was not involved in the design or production of the MP40. The weapon's other variants included '''MP 40/I''' and the '''MP 41'''. From 1940 to 1945, an estimated 1.1 million were produced by [[Erma Werke]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-278-0899-26, Russland, Soldat mit MP 40 im Schnee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Willy Zimmermann]], a highly decorated German [[Unteroffizier]], with an MP 40 on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in 1944|alt=]]\n\nThe ''Maschinenpistole 40'' (\"Machine pistol 40\") descended from its predecessor the MP 38, which was in turn based on the MP 36, a prototype made of machined steel.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=13}} The MP 36 was developed independently by [[Erma Werke]]'s Berthold Geipel with funding from the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. It took design elements from [[Heinrich Vollmer]]'s VPM 1930 and [[ERMA EMP-35|EMP]]. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype to answer a request from the ''[[Heereswaffenamt]]'' (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 36, and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38, with certain cost-saving alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=13}}\n\nThe MP 40 was often called the \"Schmeisser\" by the Allies, after the weapon designer [[Hugo Schmeisser]]. Schmeisser had designed the [[MP 18]], which was the first mass-produced submachine gun. He did not, however, have anything to do with the design or development of the MP 40, although he held a patent on the magazine.{{sfn|Rottman|2012|p=9}}\n\n==Design==\nThe MP 40 submachine guns are [[open-bolt]], [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]]-operated [[Automatic firearm|automatic]] arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but the relatively low rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls.{{sfn|Peterson|2011|p=314}} The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide which serves as a pneumatic recoil buffer.{{sfn|Peterson|2011|p=314}} The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=259}} It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=259}} The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop that were used to hold the bolt in the forward position.{{sfn|World Guns}}\n\nThe MP 38 receiver was made of machined steel, but this was a time-consuming and expensive process.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}} To save time and materials, and thus increase production, construction of the MP 40 receiver was simplified by using stamped steel and electro-[[spot welding]] as much as possible.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}} The MP 38 also features longitudinal grooving on the receiver and bolt, as well as a circular opening on the magazine housing. These features were eliminated on the MP 40.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-198-1394-06A, Russland, Soldat mit MP.jpg|thumb|left|A soldier of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] with an MP 38 in 1943|alt=]]\n\nOne unique feature found on most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or [[bakelite]] resting bar or support under the barrel. This was used to steady the weapon when firing over the side of open-top [[armored personnel carrier]]s such as the [[Sd.Kfz. 251]] [[half-track]]. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip.{{sfn|Hobart|1975|pp=95\u201398}} The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned.{{sfn|Hobart|1975|pp=95\u201398}} The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=90}} However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=90}}\n\nAlthough the MP 40 was generally reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert found on the [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson M1921/1928 variants]], the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated by the presence of dirt or other debris.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}} This could cause the weapon to [[Firearm malfunction|malfunction]] when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips to move out of the line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}} German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}}\n\n==Usage==\nAt the outbreak of World War II, the majority of German soldiers carried either [[Karabiner 98k]] rifles or MP 40s, both of which were regarded as the standard weapons of choice for an infantryman.{{sfn|Neil|2015|p=65}}\n\nHowever, later confrontations with Soviet troops such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], where entire enemy units were armed with [[PPSh-41]] submachine guns, the Germans found themselves out-gunned in short range urban combat which caused a shift in their tactics, and by the end of the war the MP 40 and its derivatives were being issued to entire assault platoons on a limited basis.{{sfn|Priestley|Cavatore|2014|pp=105\u2013108}} Starting in 1943, the German military moved to replace both the Karabiner 98k rifle and MP 40 with the new, revolutionary [[StG 44]].{{sfn|Priestley|Cavatore|2014|pp=105\u2013108}}{{sfn|Neil|2015|p=65}} By the end of World War II in 1945, an estimated 1.1 million MP 40s had been produced of all variants.{{sfn|Willbanks|2004|p=82}}\n\n===Post-war usage===\nDuring and after the end of World War II, many MP 40s were captured or surrendered (upwards of 200,000) to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and were then redistributed to the paramilitary and irregular forces of some developing countries.{{sfn|Ingram|2001|p=75}} The Norwegian army withdrew the MP 38 from use in 1975 but used the MP 40 for some years more. In particular, the Territorials ([[Home Guard (Norway)|Heimevernet]]) used it until about 1990, when it was replaced by the [[Heckler & Koch MP5]].{{sfn|World Guns}}\n\n==Variants==\n===MP 40/I===\nThe MP 40/I (sometimes erroneously called ''MP 40/II'') was a modified version of the standard MP 40 with a dual side-by-side magazine holder (for a theoretical ammunition total of 64 rounds), designed for special operations troops on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to compensate for the enemies' PPSh-41 larger magazine capacity. However, the design proved unsuccessful due to weight and reliability issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===MP 41===\n[[File:German MP wooden stock.jpg|thumb|An MP 41 with wooden stock|alt=]]\nIn 1941, Hugo Schmeisser designed the MP 41, which was, in reality, an MP 40 upper receiver with a lower receiver of an [[MP 18|MP 28]] submachine gun. It saw limited service, however, and was issued only to [[SS]] and police units in 1944. The MP 41 was also supplied to Germany's [[Axis Powers|Axis ally]] Romania.{{sfn|Axworthy|1991|p=42}}\n\n===Zastava M56===\n[[File:Brzostrelka M56.jpg|thumb|A Zastava M56|alt=]]\nA clone of the MP40 developed in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after the war, the [[Zastava M56]] differs from the MP40 by the increased barrel length, curved magazine, and [[7.62x25mm Tokarev|cartridge]], which allows for better penetration than the MP40.

Each of these was named to honor a member of the [[British royal family]], and Orange County took its name from the [[Prince of Orange]], who subsequently became King [[William III of England]]. As originally defined, Orange County included only the southern part of its present-day territory, plus all of present-day [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] further south. The northern part of the present-day county, beyond [[Moodna Creek]], was then a part of neighbouring [[Ulster County]].\n\nAt that date, the only [[European American|European]] inhabitants of the area were a handful of [[Dutch Americans|Dutch]] colonists in present-day Rockland County, and the area of modern Orange County was entirely occupied by the native [[Munsee]] people. Due to its relatively small population, the original Orange County was not fully independent and was administered by [[Manhattan|New York County]].\n\nThe first European settlers in the area of the present-day county arrived in 1685. They were a party of around twenty-five families from [[Scotland]], led by David Toshach, the [[Laird]] of [[Monzievaird]], and his brother-in-law Major Patrick McGregor, a former officer of the [[French Army]]. They settled in the [[Hudson Highlands]] at the place where the Moodna Creek enters the [[Hudson River]], now known as [[New Windsor, New York|New Windsor]]. In 1709, a group of [[German Palatine]] refugees settled at [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]]. They were Protestants from a part of Germany along the Rhine that had suffered during the religious wars. Queen Anne's government arranged for passage from England of nearly 3,000 Palatines in ten ships. Many were settled along the Hudson River in work camps on property belonging to [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]]. A group of Dutch and English settlers arrived at [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen]] in 1712. Additional immigrants came from Ireland; they were of Scots and English descent who had been settled as planters there.\n\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]] the county was a hotbed of Loyalist and anti-Patriot activity. [[Claudius Smith]] was a Loyalist marauder whose team robbed and terrorized citizens; he was hanged in Goshen in 1779 for allegedly robbing and killing Major Nathaniel Strong; two of his sons were also executed for similar crimes. The Mathews family of [[Blooming Grove, New York|Blooming Grove]] were active Loyalists; Fletcher Mathews was a sympathizer and sometime associate of Smith,<ref>Public Papers of George Clinton, First Governor of New York, 1777-1795, 1801-1804. 1900, page 634</ref> and his brother [[David Mathews]] was Mayor of [[New York City]] during its British occupation for the entirety of the war.\n\nIn 1798, after the American Revolutionary War, the boundaries of Orange County changed. Its southern corner was used to create the new Rockland County, and in exchange, an area to the north of the Moodna Creek was added, which had previously been in Ulster County. This caused a reorganization of the local administration, as the original county seat had been fixed at [[Orangetown, New York|Orangetown]] in 1703, but this was now in Rockland County. Duties were subsequently shared between Goshen, which had been the center of government for the northern part of Orange County, and Newburgh, which played a similar role in the area transferred from Ulster County. The county court was established in 1801.  It was not until 1970 that Goshen was named as the sole county seat.\n\nDue to a [[New York \u2013 New Jersey Line War|boundary dispute between New York and New Jersey]], the boundaries of many of the southern towns of the county were not definitively established until the 19th century.<ref name=\"sources\">Headly, Russel, (1908), ''The History of Orange County New York'',[https://archive.org/stream/historyoforangec00head#page/n5/mode/2up] Skeel, Adelaide, and Barclay, David, (1900), ''Major Patrick MacGregorie'',[https://archive.org/stream/majorpatrickmacg00skee#page/n1/mode/2up] Green, Frank Bertangue, (1886), ''The History of Rockland County''.[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028832974#page/n5/mode/2up]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Downtown Newburgh from Beacon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Downtown [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]], on the shoreline of the [[Hudson River]].]]\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|839|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|812|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|27|sqmi}} (3.2%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 6, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|archivedate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOrange County is in southeastern New York State, directly north of the [[New Jersey]]-New York border, west of the [[Hudson River]], east of the [[Delaware River]] and northwest of [[New York City]].

Its board consisted of the 20 town supervisors, nine city supervisors elected from the nine wards of the City of Newburgh, and four each elected from the wards of the cities of Middletown and Port Jervis. In 1968, the board adopted a county charter and a reapportionment plan that created the county legislature and executive. The first county executive and legislature were elected in November, 1969 and took office on January 1, 1970. Today, Orange County is still governed by the same charter; residents elect the county executive and a 21-member county legislature elected from 21 [[single-member district]]s. There are also several state constitutional positions that are elected, including a sheriff, county clerk and district attorney. Prior to 1&nbsp;January 2008 four [[coroner]]s were also elected; however, on that date, the county switched to a [[medical examiner]] system.\n\nThe current county officers are:\n* County Executive: Steven M. Neuhaus (Republican)\n* County Clerk: Annie Rabbit (Republican)\n* Sheriff: Carl E. DuBois (Republican)\n* District Attorney: David M.

However, since the late 20th century, the Democrats have closed the gap. During 2008 and 2009 the legislature was evenly split between 10 [[Republican Party of New York|Republicans]], 10 [[Democratic Party of New York|Democrats]], and 1 [[Independence Party of New York|Independence Party]] member. In 2009, the legislature had its first Democratic chairman elected when one member of the Republican caucus voted alongside the 10 Democratic members to elect [[Roxanne Donnery]] (D-Highlands/Woodbury) to the post. At the November 2009 election, several Democratic incumbents were defeated. As of the convening of the legislature on January 1, 2012, there are 12 Republicans, 8 Democrats ,and 1 Independence member.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''Orange County Executives'''\n!

The [[sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], [[district attorney]] and county clerk have always been elected. All serve four-year terms, with elections in the year following presidential election years, save the sheriff, whose election is the following year.\n\nThe current county executive is Steven Neuhaus, former town supervisor for Chester. Frank Phillips, [[Ann Rabbitt|Annie Rabbitt]] and Carl DuBois are the incumbent district attorney, clerk and sheriff respectively. All are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and as of 2012 the legislature has a 13\u20138 Republican majority.\n\nOnly one [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Mary McPhillips, has served as county executive. She failed to win re-election after a single term in the early 1990s. For several years in the late 2000s, one Republican legislator's decision to become an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] and caucus with the Democrats led to a 10-10-1 effective Democratic majority, with [[Roxanne Donnery]] as chair. The Republicans regained their majority in the 2009 elections.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Coach USA ShortLine 50889.jpg|thumb|[[Short Line (bus company)|Short Line Bus]] provides most local and commuter bus service.]]\n\nThe county is served by [[Stewart International Airport]], located two miles west of [[Newburgh, New York]]. The airport serves [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Allegiant Air]], and [[JetBlue Airways]]. [[AirTran Airways]] stopped providing service to the airport in late 2008.\n\nGround transportation within Orange County is provided primarily by [[Leprechaun Lines]], [[Monsey Trails]], [[NJ Transit]], [[Short Line (bus company)|Short Line Bus]], and [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[Port Jervis Line]], as well as amenities such as senior citizen busing and car services, which usually restrict themselves to their respective town or city.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.transitorange.info/bus-services/index.html|title= COMMUTER BUS SERVICE|author=<!--government website; no by-line.--> |date= |website=Transit Orange|publisher=Orange County |access-date= 2015-11-29|quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.leprechaunlines.com/commuter_newburghbeacon.asp |title=Commuter Bus - Newburgh, Beacon & Stewart |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Leprechan Lines  |publisher= |access-date=2015-11-29 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nMajor routes in Orange County are freeways [[Interstate 84 in New York|Interstate 84]], [[Interstate 87 in New York|Interstate 87]], [[New York State Route 17|State Route 17]] (Future [[Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania-New York)|Interstate 86]]), and the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]], and surface roads [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|U.S. Route 6]], [[U.S. Route 9W in New York|U.S. Route 9W]], and [[U.S. Route 209 in New York|U.S. Route 209]]. There are two Hudson River crossings in Orange County: the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] and the [[Newburgh-Beacon Bridge]].\n\n==Politics==\n\n[[George W. Bush]] won 54% of the Orange County vote in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]] reflecting a solid [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] edge in county politics. However, [[Barack Obama]] carried the county by a 51% margin [[2008 United States presidential election|four years later]]. It was the first time a Democrat had carried Orange County when first elected to the presidency. That year the number of [[voter registration|registered]] Democrats in the county exceeded Republicans for the first time. Obama carried the county again in 2012. However, [[Donald Trump]] won the county in 2016, thus making it one of 206 counties across the country to vote for Obama twice and then Trump.\n\nThe presidential election results give the county a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index|Cook PVI]] of R+1, consistent with county voters' willingness to sometimes elect Democrats, such as U.S. Rep. [[John Hall (U.S. politician)|John Hall]]. From 2007 on, when Hall represented the [[New York's 19th congressional district|19th district]], which covered most of the county, Orange's representation in Congress was exclusively Democratic, as [[Maurice Hinchey]] had represented the towns of Crawford, Montgomery, and Newburgh as well as the city of Newburgh, all of which were in what was then the [[New York's 22nd congressional district|22nd district]], since 1988.\n\nIn the [[2010 United States House of Representatives elections|2010 midterms]], Hall was defeated by [[Nan Hayworth]]. In 2012, after Hinchey's former 22nd district was eliminated in redistricting following his retirement and all of Orange County was included in the current [[New York's 18th congressional district|18th district]].

Each of these was named to honor a member of the [[British royal family]], and Orange County took its name from the [[Prince of Orange]], who subsequently became King [[William III of England]]. As originally defined, Orange County included only the southern part of its present-day territory, plus all of present-day [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] further south. The northern part of the present-day county, beyond [[Moodna Creek]], was then a part of neighbouring [[Ulster County]].\n\nAt that date, the only [[European American|European]] inhabitants of the area were a handful of [[Dutch Americans|Dutch]] colonists in present-day Rockland County, and the area of modern Orange County was entirely occupied by the native [[Munsee]] people. Due to its relatively small population, the original Orange County was not fully independent and was administered by [[Manhattan|New York County]].\n\nThe first European settlers in the area of the present-day county arrived in 1685. They were a party of around twenty-five families from [[Scotland]], led by David Toshach, the [[Laird]] of [[Monzievaird]], and his brother-in-law Major Patrick McGregor, a former officer of the [[French Army]]. They settled in the [[Hudson Highlands]] at the place where the Moodna Creek enters the [[Hudson River]], now known as [[New Windsor, New York|New Windsor]]. In 1709, a group of [[German Palatine]] refugees settled at [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]]. They were Protestants from a part of Germany along the Rhine that had suffered during the religious wars. Queen Anne's government arranged for passage from England of nearly 3,000 Palatines in ten ships. Many were settled along the Hudson River in work camps on property belonging to [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]]. A group of Dutch and English settlers arrived at [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen]] in 1712. Additional immigrants came from Ireland; they were of Scots and English descent who had been settled as planters there.\n\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]] the county was a hotbed of Loyalist and anti-Patriot activity. [[Claudius Smith]] was a Loyalist marauder whose team robbed and terrorized citizens; he was hanged in Goshen in 1779 for allegedly robbing and killing Major Nathaniel Strong; two of his sons were also executed for similar crimes. The Mathews family of [[Blooming Grove, New York|Blooming Grove]] were active Loyalists; Fletcher Mathews was a sympathizer and sometime associate of Smith,<ref>Public Papers of George Clinton, First Governor of New York, 1777-1795, 1801-1804. 1900, page 634</ref> and his brother [[David Mathews]] was Mayor of [[New York City]] during its British occupation for the entirety of the war.\n\nIn 1798, after the American Revolutionary War, the boundaries of Orange County changed. Its southern corner was used to create the new Rockland County, and in exchange, an area to the north of the Moodna Creek was added, which had previously been in Ulster County. This caused a reorganization of the local administration, as the original county seat had been fixed at [[Orangetown, New York|Orangetown]] in 1703, but this was now in Rockland County. Duties were subsequently shared between Goshen, which had been the center of government for the northern part of Orange County, and Newburgh, which played a similar role in the area transferred from Ulster County. The county court was established in 1801.  It was not until 1970 that Goshen was named as the sole county seat.\n\nDue to a [[New York \u2013 New Jersey Line War|boundary dispute between New York and New Jersey]], the boundaries of many of the southern towns of the county were not definitively established until the 19th century.<ref name=\"sources\">Headly, Russel, (1908), ''The History of Orange County New York'',[https://archive.org/stream/historyoforangec00head#page/n5/mode/2up] Skeel, Adelaide, and Barclay, David, (1900), ''Major Patrick MacGregorie'',[https://archive.org/stream/majorpatrickmacg00skee#page/n1/mode/2up] Green, Frank Bertangue, (1886), ''The History of Rockland County''.[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028832974#page/n5/mode/2up]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Downtown Newburgh from Beacon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Downtown [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]], on the shoreline of the [[Hudson River]].]]\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|839|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|812|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|27|sqmi}} (3.2%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 6, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|archivedate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOrange County is in southeastern New York State, directly north of the [[New Jersey]]-New York border, west of the [[Hudson River]], east of the [[Delaware River]] and northwest of [[New York City]].

Its board consisted of the 20 town supervisors, nine city supervisors elected from the nine wards of the City of Newburgh, and four each elected from the wards of the cities of Middletown and Port Jervis. In 1968, the board adopted a county charter and a reapportionment plan that created the county legislature and executive. The first county executive and legislature were elected in November, 1969 and took office on January 1, 1970. Today, Orange County is still governed by the same charter; residents elect the county executive and a 21-member county legislature elected from 21 [[single-member district]]s. There are also several state constitutional positions that are elected, including a sheriff, county clerk and district attorney. Prior to 1&nbsp;January 2008 four [[coroner]]s were also elected; however, on that date, the county switched to a [[medical examiner]] system.\n\nThe current county officers are:\n* County Executive: Steven M. Neuhaus (Republican)\n* County Clerk: Annie Rabbit (Republican)\n* Sheriff: Carl E. DuBois (Republican)\n* District Attorney: David M.

However, since the late 20th century, the Democrats have closed the gap. During 2008 and 2009 the legislature was evenly split between 10 [[Republican Party of New York|Republican]]s, 10 [[Democratic Party of New York|Democrat]]s, and 1 [[Independence Party of New York|Independence Party]] member. In 2009, the legislature had its first Democratic chairman elected when one member of the Republican caucus voted alongside the 10 Democratic members to elect [[Roxanne Donnery]] (D-Highlands/Woodbury) to the post. At the November 2009 election, several Democratic incumbents were defeated. As of the convening of the legislature on January 1, 2012, there are 12 Republicans, 8 Democrats ,and 1 Independence member.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''Orange County Executives'''\n!

The [[sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], [[district attorney]] and county clerk have always been elected. All serve four-year terms, with elections in the year following presidential election years, save the sheriff, whose election is the following year.\n\nThe current county executive is Steven Neuhaus, former town supervisor for Chester. Frank Phillips, [[Ann Rabbitt|Annie Rabbitt]] and Carl DuBois are the incumbent district attorney, clerk and sheriff respectively. All are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and as of 2012 the legislature has a 13\u20138 Republican majority.\n\nOnly one [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Mary McPhillips, has served as county executive. She failed to win re-election after a single term in the early 1990s. For several years in the late 2000s, one Republican legislator's decision to become an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] and caucus with the Democrats led to a 10-10-1 effective Democratic majority, with [[Roxanne Donnery]] as chair. The Republicans regained their majority in the 2009 elections.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Coach USA ShortLine 50889.jpg|thumb|[[Short Line (bus company)|Short Line Bus]] provides most local and commuter bus service.]]\n\nThe county is served by [[Stewart International Airport]], located two miles west of [[Newburgh, New York]]. The airport serves [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Allegiant Air]], and [[JetBlue Airways]]. [[AirTran Airways]] stopped providing service to the airport in late 2008.\n\nGround transportation within Orange County is provided primarily by [[Leprechaun Lines]], [[Monsey Trails]], [[NJ Transit]], [[Short Line (bus company)|Short Line Bus]], and [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[Port Jervis Line]], as well as amenities such as senior citizen busing and car services, which usually restrict themselves to their respective town or city.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.transitorange.info/bus-services/index.html|title= COMMUTER BUS SERVICE|author=<!--government website; no by-line.--> |date= |website=Transit Orange|publisher=Orange County |access-date= 2015-11-29|quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.leprechaunlines.com/commuter_newburghbeacon.asp |title=Commuter Bus - Newburgh, Beacon & Stewart |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Leprechan Lines  |publisher= |access-date=2015-11-29 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nMajor routes in Orange County are freeways [[Interstate 84 in New York|Interstate 84]], [[Interstate 87 in New York|Interstate 87]], [[New York State Route 17|State Route 17]] (Future [[Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania-New York)|Interstate 86]]), and the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]], and surface roads [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|U.S. Route 6]], [[U.S. Route 9W in New York|U.S. Route 9W]], and [[U.S. Route 209 in New York|U.S. Route 209]]. There are two Hudson River crossings in Orange County: the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] and the [[Newburgh-Beacon Bridge]].\n\n==Politics==\n\n[[George W. Bush]] won 54% of the Orange County vote in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]] reflecting a solid [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] edge in county politics. However, [[Barack Obama]] carried the county by a 51% margin [[2008 United States presidential election|four years later]]. It was the first time a Democrat had carried Orange County when first elected to the presidency. That year the number of [[voter registration|registered]] Democrats in the county exceeded Republicans for the first time. Obama carried the county again in 2012. However, [[Donald Trump]] won the county in 2016, thus making it one of 206 counties across the country to vote for Obama twice and then Trump.\n\nThe presidential election results give the county a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index|Cook PVI]] of R+1, consistent with county voters' willingness to sometimes elect Democrats, such as U.S. Rep. [[John Hall (U.S. politician)|John Hall]]. From 2007 on, when Hall represented the [[New York's 19th congressional district|19th district]], which covered most of the county, Orange's representation in Congress was exclusively Democratic, as [[Maurice Hinchey]] had represented the towns of Crawford, Montgomery, and Newburgh as well as the city of Newburgh, all of which were in what was then the [[New York's 22nd congressional district|22nd district]], since 1988.\n\nIn the [[2010 United States House of Representatives elections|2010 midterms]], Hall was defeated by [[Nan Hayworth]]. In 2012, after Hinchey's former 22nd district was eliminated in redistricting following his retirement and all of Orange County was included in the current [[New York's 18th congressional district|18th district]]. Hayworth was defeated by Democrat [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a former adviser to President [[Bill Clinton]] and the first openly gay person to be elected to Congress from New York.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bolcer |first=Julie |url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/election/2012/11/07/openly-gay-congressional-winner-makes-history-new-york?page=0,1 |title=Gay Congressional Winner Makes History in New York |publisher=Advocate.com |date=7 November 2013 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> Maloney won a rematch against Hayworth in 2014; in 2016 he was again re-elected over Phil Oliva, and in 2018, despite running in the Democratic primary for [[New York Attorney General]], he won re-election again over James O'Donnell.\n\nAt the state level, Republicans had held onto Senate seats (until 2018) while Democrats have made inroads in recent years on the Assembly side. Two [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] districts\u2014the 39th, held by [[James Skoufis]] and 42nd, held by [[Jen Metzger]]\u2014cover the county.\n\nDemocrats have made significant gains in the county's State Assembly seats. The 98th district, which includes the far western part of the county as well as the Town of Warwick, is represented by [[Karl Brabenec]], and the 101st district, which includes the Towns of Crawford and Montgomery, was until 2016 held by [[Claudia Tenney]], both Republicans. After Tenney left her seat to run for Congress that year, [[Brian D. Miller]], another Republican, was elected to replace her. Colin Schmitt represents the 99th district, while the other two are Democrats: [[Aileen Gunther]] in the 100th district and Jonathan Jacobson in the 104th district.\n\n==Sports==\n[[Delano-Hitch Stadium]] in Newburgh has played host to various professional and amateur baseball teams from various leagues since opening in 1926. The stadium is currently home to the [[North Country Baseball League|Newburgh Newts]].\n\n===High school sports===\nHigh schools in Orange County compete in Section 9 of the [[New York State Public High School Athletic Association]] along with schools from [[Dutchess County, NY|Dutchess]], [[Ulster County, NY|Ulster]], and [[Sullivan County, NY|Sullivan]] counties.\n\n===College sports===\nThe [[Army Black Knights]] of the [[United States Military Academy]] in [[West Point]] field [[NCAA Division I]] teams in 24 different sports. [[Mount Saint Mary College]] in [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]] fields 15 teams in the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] and the [[Skyline Conference]] of [[NCAA Division III]]. [[Orange County Community College|Orange County Community College Colts]] in [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]] compete in the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]].\n\n===Orange County Youth Football League (OCYFL)===\nThe Orange County Youth Football League (O.C.Y.F.L.) is a [[non-profit organization]] that allows youth age 6 through 14 to play competitive [[American football]].  The League encompasses 15 towns with over 100 teams in Orange County and surrounding areas including Chester, Cornwall, Goshen, Highland Falls, Marlboro, Middletown, Minisink Valley, Monticello, Newburgh, New Windsor, Pine Bush, Port Jervis, Valley Central, Wallkill, Warwick and Washingtonville.<ref>[http://www.ocyfl.net OCYFL<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723231716/http://www.ocyfl.net/ |date=2011-07-23 }}</ref>  It is composed of 4 Divisions, divided by weight restrictions, and a \"Mighty Mite\" [[Flag Football]] division for 6 & 7 year olds.  In each division, there is additionally a complete [[cheerleading]] program for each team.

After performing the song on \"The Helen Show\", Helen suggests that Austin returns and performs another original song. Austin isn't good at song-writing, and the only solution he can think of is to plead with Ally to write another song for him. Ally initially denies in anger, but later agrees to help him. The two bond while working on their next song, \"Break Down the Walls\", and Austin asks Ally to be there when he performs it. However, when the pianist gets sick, Ally has to fill in.

Fallschirm-J\u00e4ger-Division'''}}) was an elite [[Nazi Germany|German]] military parachute-landing [[Division (military)|division]] that fought during [[World War II]]. A division of [[paratrooper]]s was termed a ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' Division. For reasons of secrecy, it was originally raised as the '''7th Air Division''', or ''Flieger-Division'', before being renamed and reorganized as the 1st Parachute Division in 1943.\n\n==Operational history==\nThe division was formed in October 1938 under the command of Major-General [[Kurt Student]]. At the start of World War II, the Division contained two parachute regiments; it was brought up to full strength in 1941. In April 1940, division took part in the invasion of Denmark and Norway during [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], successfully seizing several airfields. \n\nThe German plan for the invasion of [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] in May 1940 called for the use of the 7th Fliegerdivision to aid in the advance through the capture of key bridges and the fortress of [[Fort Eben-Emael|Eben Emael]].\nThe [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of the Netherlands]] included the majority of the 7th Fliegerdivision in cooperation with the [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|22nd Air Landing Division]]. This force was grouped as the 7th Fliegerkorps, and commanded by Kurt Student. The attack on The Hague was a failure: the high loss of transport planes grew to quite dramatic proportions. Many paratroopers and airlanding troops were captured, hundreds were killed or wounded and over 1,200 prisoners of both divisions were transported to England. (The [[Rotterdam Blitz]] on 14 May 1940 led to Rotterdam's surrender.) The Eben Emael assault was a complete success with both the fort itself and 1,000+ enemy captured.\n\nThe division took part in the [[Battle of Crete]]. The Allied forces on the island put up a stubborn defense and the troops of the 7th Fliegerdivision took heavy losses. With the aid of the follow-on reinforcements, however, the Allies were forced to evacuate the island by 29 May.\n\nThe division took part in the July 1943 fight against the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. For the remainder of the war, the division fought in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]]. From 14\u201327 December 1943, the division, under General-Lieutenant [[Richard Heidrich]], saw action against the [[1st Canadian Division]] in the [[Battle of Ortona]]. Later the division was concentrated in the defense of the [[Winter Line]] south of [[Rome]], defending against the advance of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Oliver Leese]]. In February to May 1944, the 1st Parachute Division took part in the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]], and in late May and June it fought against the Allied [[Operation Diadem]] later retreating to the north of Rome. They formed part of the [[German I Parachute Corps]], along with the German [[4th Parachute Division (Germany)|4th Parachute Division]].\n\nBy January 1945, the German I Parachute Corps was deployed to the [[Adriatic]] coast behind the Senio Rivier. The [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Allied advance]] resumed on 8 April, and the 1st Parachute Division was forced into a steady withdrawal toward the [[Po River]] by the British Eighth Army. By 25 April, the division had completed the river crossing. They immediately set off on a final march toward the [[Alps|Alpine Mountains]]. Finally the German surrender in Italy came on 2 May 1945, and included the men of the 1st Parachute Division. The [[unconditional surrender]] of Germany followed a week later.\n\n==War crimes==\nThe division was responsible for the complete and deliberate destruction of [[Roccaraso]] and later on for the Limmari maasacre ([[:it:Eccidio di Pietransieri]]) in which 128 Italian civilians were executed on 21 November 1943.<ref name= \"Pietransieri\" >{{cite news |date= |title=PIETRANSIERI ROCCARASO 21.11.1943|trans-title= |url=http://www.straginazifasciste.it/?page_id=38&id_strage=3014&lang=en |language=Italian |work=Atlas of Nazi and Fascist Massacres in Italy |location= |access-date=21 August 2018 }}</ref> The victims were 60 women, 34 children under the age of 10, 23 elderly people over 60 years old.

In April 1940, division took part in the invasion of Denmark and Norway during [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], successfully seizing several airfields. \n\nThe German plan for the invasion of [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] in May 1940 called for the use of the 7th Fliegerdivision to aid in the advance through the capture of key bridges and the fortress of [[Fort Eben-Emael|Eben Emael]].\nThe [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of the Netherlands]] included the majority of the 7th Fliegerdivision in cooperation with the [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|22nd Air Landing Division]]. This force was grouped as the 7th Fliegerkorps, and commanded by Kurt Student. The attack on The Hague was a failure: the high loss of transport planes grew to quite dramatic proportions. Many paratroopers and airlanding troops were captured, hundreds were killed or wounded and over 1,200 prisoners of both divisions were transported to England. (The [[Rotterdam Blitz]] on 14 May 1940 led to Rotterdam's surrender.) The Eben Emael assault was a complete success with both the fort itself and 1,000+ enemy captured.\n\nThe division took part in the [[Battle of Crete]]. The Allied forces on the island put up a stubborn defense and the troops of the 7th Fliegerdivision took heavy losses. With the aid of the follow-on reinforcements, however, the Allies were forced to evacuate the island by 29 May.\n\nThe division took part in the July 1943 fight against the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. For the remainder of the war, the division fought in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]]. From 14\u201327 December 1943, the division, under General-Lieutenant [[Richard Heidrich]], saw action against the [[1st Canadian Division]] in the [[Battle of Ortona]]. Later the division was concentrated in the defense of the [[Winter Line]] south of [[Rome]], defending against the advance of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Oliver Leese]]. In February to May 1944, the 1st Parachute Division took part in the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]], and in late May and June it fought against the Allied [[Operation Diadem]] later retreating to the north of Rome. They formed part of the [[German I Parachute Corps]], along with the German [[4th Parachute Division (Germany)|4th Parachute Division]].\n\nBy January 1945, the German I Parachute Corps was deployed to the [[Adriatic]] coast behind the Senio Rivier. The [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Allied advance]] resumed on 8 April, and the 1st Parachute Division was forced into a steady withdrawal toward the [[Po River]] by the British Eighth Army. By 25 April, the division had completed the river crossing. They immediately set off on a final march toward the [[Alps|Alpine Mountains]]. Finally the German surrender in Italy came on 2 May 1945, and included the men of the 1st Parachute Division. The [[unconditional surrender]] of Germany followed a week later.\n\n==War crimes==\nThe division was responsible for the complete and deliberate destruction of [[Roccaraso]] and later on for the Limmari maasacre ([[:it:Eccidio di Pietransieri]]) in which 128 Italian civilians were executed on 21 November 1943.<ref name= \"Pietransieri\" >{{cite news |date= |title=PIETRANSIERI ROCCARASO 21.11.1943|trans-title= |url=http://www.straginazifasciste.it/?page_id=38&id_strage=3014&lang=en |language=Italian |work=Atlas of Nazi and Fascist Massacres in Italy |location= |access-date=21 August 2018 }}</ref> The victims were 60 women, 34 children under the age of 10, 23 elderly people over 60 years old.

Obsessively, Maravich spent hours practicing ball control tricks, passes, head fakes, and long-range shots.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMaravich played high school [[varsity team|varsity]] ball at [[Daniel High School]] in [[Central, South Carolina]], a year before being old enough to attend the school.  While at Daniel from 1961 to 1963, Maravich participated in the school's first-ever game against a team from an all-black school. In 1963 his father departed from his position as head basketball coach at [[Clemson University]] and joined the coaching staff at [[North Carolina State University]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The Maravich family's subsequent move to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], allowed Pete to attend [[Needham B. Broughton High School]].<ref name=\":0\" />  His high school years also saw the birth of his famous moniker.  From his habit of shooting the ball from his side, as if he were holding a [[revolver]], Maravich became known as \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich. He graduated from Needham B. Broughton High School in 1965 and then attended [[Southwood College|Edwards Military Institute]], where he averaged 33 points per game. Pete never liked school and did not like Edwards Military institute. It was known that Press Maravich was extremely protective of Maravich and would guard against any issue that may come up during his adolescence. Press threatened to shoot Pete with a 45 caliber gun if he drank or got into trouble.<ref name=\":0\" /> Maravich was 6 feet 4 inches in high school and was getting ready to play in college when his father took a coaching position at Louisiana State University.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==College career==\nAt that time NCAA rules prohibited first-year students from playing at varsity level, which forced Maravich to play on the freshman team.

Retrieved June 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nMaravich's long-standing collegiate scoring record is particularly notable when three factors are taken into account:\n*First, because of the [[NCAA]] rules that prohibited him from taking part in varsity competition during his first year as a student, Maravich was prevented from adding to his career record for a full quarter of his time at LSU.  During this first year, Maravich scored 741 points in freshman competition.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Pistol: The Life of Pete Maravich|last=Kriegel|first=Mark|publisher=Free Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7432-8497-4|location=New York|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/pistollifeofpete00krie}}</ref>\n*Second, Maravich played before the advent of the [[three-point field goal|three-point]] line. This significant difference has raised speculation regarding just how much higher his records would be, given his long-range shooting ability and how such a component might have altered his play. Writing for [[ESPN.com]], Bob Carter stated, \"Though Maravich played before [...] the 3-point shot was established, he loved gunning from long range.\"<ref>{{cite web | last =Medcalf  | first =Myron | title =What if 'Pistol' Pete had a 3-point line? | website =[[ESPN.com]] | publisher =[[ESPN]] | date =August 18, 2014 | url =http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/99934/what-if-pistol-pete-had-a-3-point-line | accessdate = September 16, 2015 }}</ref> It has been reported that former LSU coach [[Dale Brown (basketball)|Dale Brown]] charted every shot Maravich scored and concluded that, if his shots from three-point range had been counted as three points, Maravich's average would have totaled 57 points per game.<ref>{{cite web | last =Diaz\n| first =Angel | last2 =Erwin | first2 =Jack | last3 =Warner | first3 =Ralph | title =The 25 Most Unbreakable Records in Sports History | website =[[Complex (magazine)|Complex.com]] | publisher = | date =March 2, 2012 | url =http://www.complex.com/sports/2012/03/the-25-most-unbreakable-records-in-sports-history/15 | accessdate = September 16, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media | people =[[Steve Bunin]], [[Bill Walton]] | title =Remembering Pete Maravich | medium =Television production | publisher =[[The Hot List]] | location = | date =2006 | time =1:56 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk-JJX2SRHc&t=1m56s | access-date =October 3, 2015}}</ref>\n*Third, the [[shot clock]] had also not yet been instituted in NCAA play during Maravich's college career. (A time limit on ball possession speeds up play, mandates an additional number of field goal attempts, eliminates [[Stalling (gaming)|stalling]], and increases the number of possessions throughout the game, all resulting in higher overall scoring.)<ref name=nytimes />\n\nMore than 40 years later, however, many of his NCAA and LSU records still stand. Maravich was a three-time All-American. Though he never appeared in the NCAA tournament, Maravich played a key role in turning around a lackluster program that had posted a 3\u201320 record in the season prior to his arrival.

In fact, Maravich's flamboyant style stood in stark contrast to the conservative play of Hudson and star center [[Walt Bellamy]].  And it did not help that many of the veteran players resented the $1.9 million contract that Maravich received from the team\u2014a very large salary at that time.<ref name=\"NBAhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/maravich_bio.html|title=Pete Maravich Bio|date=|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMaravich appeared in 81 games and averaged 23.2 points per contest\u2014good enough to earn [[NBA All-Rookie Team]] honors.  And he managed to blend his style with his teammates, so much so that Hudson set a career high by scoring 26.8 points per game.  But the team stumbled to a 36\u201346 record\u201412 wins fewer than in the previous season.  Still, the Hawks qualified for the playoffs, where they lost to the [[New York Knicks]] in the first round.\n\nMaravich struggled somewhat during his second season.  His scoring average dipped to 19.3 points per game, and the Hawks finished with another disappointing 36\u201346 record.  Once again they qualified for the playoffs, and once again they were eliminated in the first round.  However, Atlanta fought hard against the [[Boston Celtics]], with Maravich averaging 27.7 points in the series.\n\nMaravich erupted in his third season, averaging 26.1 points (5th in the NBA) and dishing out 6.9 assists per game (6th in the NBA).  With 2,063 points, he combined with Hudson (2,029 points) to become only the second set of teammates in league history to each score over 2,000 points in a single season.<ref>[[Elgin Baylor]] and [[Jerry West]] were the first to accomplish this feat in the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]' 1964\u201365 season. It has since accomplished only three times: back-to-back by [[Kiki Vandeweghe]] and [[Alex English]] of the 1982\u20131984 [[Denver Nuggets]], and by [[Larry Bird]] and [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]] of the 1986\u201387 Boston Celtics.</ref> The Hawks soared to a 46\u201336 record, but again bowed out in the first round of the playoffs.  However, the season was good enough to earn Maravich his first-ever appearance in the [[NBA All-Star Game]], and also All-NBA Second Team honors.\n\nThe following season (1973\u201374) was his best yet\u2014at least in terms of individual accomplishments.  Maravich posted 27.7 points per game\u2014second in the league behind [[Bob McAdoo]]\u2014and earned his second appearance in the All-Star Game.  However, Atlanta sank to a disappointing 35\u201347 record and missed the postseason entirely.\n\n===New Orleans Jazz===\n[[File:Pete Maravich 1977.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Maravich playing for the Jazz in 1977]]\nIn the summer of 1974, an expansion franchise was preparing for its first season of competition in the NBA.  The New Orleans Jazz were looking for something or someone to generate excitement among their new basketball fans. With his exciting style of play, Maravich was seen as the perfect man for the job. Additionally, he was already a celebrity in the state due to accomplishments at LSU.  To acquire Maravich, the Jazz traded two players and four draft picks to Atlanta.\n\nThe expansion team struggled mightily in its first season.  Maravich managed to score 21.5 points per game, but shot a career-worst 41.9 percent from the floor. The Jazz posted a 23\u201359 record, worst in the NBA.\n\nJazz management did its best to give Maravich a better supporting cast. The team posted a 38\u201344 record in its second season (1975\u201376) but did not qualify for postseason play, despite the dramatic improvement.  Maravich struggled with injuries that limited him to just 62 games that season, but he averaged 25.9 points per contest (third behind McAdoo and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]) and continued his crowd-pleasing antics. He was elected to the [[All-NBA First Team]] that year.\n\nThe following season (1976\u201377) was his most productive in the NBA.  He led the league in scoring with an average of 31.1 points per game.  He scored 40 points or more in 13 games,<ref>At the time, [[Tiny Archibald]]'s 18 games of 40+ points in 1972\u201373 was the only total higher by a guard.</ref> and 50 or more in 4 games.<ref>The most ever by a guard, until [[Michael Jordan]] did it 8 times in 1986\u201387. Jordan would go on to get 4 or more 50+ point games in three more seasons; [[Kobe Bryant]] is the only other guard to reach this mark, 6 times in 2005\u201306, and a record 10 times in 2006\u201307.</ref> His 68-point masterpiece against the Knicks<ref>[http://espn.go.com/classic/s/moment010225maravich.html \"Pete Maravich's 68 points a record\" by Larry Schwartz on ESPN Classic], November 19, 2003</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=177319 |title='Pistol' Pete Maravich \u2013 Career Recap \u2013 LSUsports.net \u2013 The Official Web Site of LSU Tigers Athletics |publisher=LSUsports.net |date= |accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref> was at the time the most points ever scored by a guard in a single game, and only two players at any position had ever scored more: [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Elgin Baylor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbahoopsonline.com/History/Leagues/NBA/pointsingame.html |title=Most points by 1 player in a NBA game, 50 point games in NBA history |publisher=Nbahoopsonline.com |date= |accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref> Baylor was head coach of the Jazz at that time.\n\nMaravich earned his third all-star game appearance and was honored as All-NBA First Team for the second consecutive season.\n\nThe following season, injuries to both knees forced him to miss 32 games during the 1977\u201378 season. Despite being robbed of some quickness and athleticism, he still managed to score 27.0 points per game, and he also added 6.7 assists per contest, his highest average as a member of the Jazz.  Many of those assists went to new teammate [[Truck Robinson]], who had joined the franchise as a free agent during the off-season. In his first year in New Orleans, he averaged 22.7 points and a league-best 15.7 rebounds per game. His presence prevented opponents from focusing their defensive efforts entirely on Maravich, and it lifted the Jazz to a 39\u201343 record\u2014just short of making the club's first-ever appearance in the playoffs.\n\nKnee problems plagued Maravich for the rest of his career. He played in just 49 games during the 1978\u201379 season. He scored 22.6 points per game that season and earned his fifth and final All-Star appearance. But his scoring and passing abilities were severely impaired. The team struggled on the court, and faced serious financial trouble as well. Management became desperate to make some changes. The Jazz traded Robinson to the [[Phoenix Suns]], receiving draft picks and some cash in return. However, in 1979, team owner [[Sam Battistone]] moved the Jazz to [[Salt Lake City]].\n\n===Final season===\nThe Utah Jazz began play in the 1979\u201380 season.  Maravich moved with the team to [[Salt Lake City]], but his knee problems were worse than ever.  He appeared in 17 games early in the season, but his injuries prevented him from practicing much, and new coach [[Tom Nissalke]] had a strict rule that players who didn't practice were not allowed to play in games.  Thus, Maravich was parked on the bench for 24 straight games, much to the dismay of Utah fans and to Maravich himself.  During that time, [[Adrian Dantley]] emerged as the team's franchise player.\n\nThe Jazz placed Maravich on [[Waivers (NBA)|waivers]] in January 1980.  He signed with the Celtics, the top team in the league that year, led by rookie superstar [[Larry Bird]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Linda Hamilton |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595102509,00.html |title=25 years later the Jazz are going strong |publisher=Deseret.news.com |date=November 2, 2004 |accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref>  Maravich adjusted to a new role as part-time contributor, giving Boston a \"hired gun\" off the bench. He helped the team post a 61\u201321 record in the regular season, best in the league.  And, for the first time since his early career in Atlanta, Maravich was able to participate in the NBA playoffs.  He appeared in nine games during that postseason, but the Celtics were upended by [[Julius Erving]] and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the Eastern Conference finals, four games to one.\n\nRealizing that his knee problems would never go away, Maravich retired at the end of that season. The NBA instituted the 3-point shot just in time for Maravich's last season in the league. He had always been famous for his long-range shooting, and his final year provided an official statistical gauge of his abilities. Between his limited playing time in Utah and Boston, he made 10 of 15 3-point shots, giving him a career 66.7% completion rate behind the arc.\n\nDuring his ten-year career in the NBA, Maravich played in 658 games, averaging 24.2 points and 5.4 assists per contest.  In 1987, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], and his No. 7 jersey has been retired by both the Jazz and the [[New Orleans Pelicans]], as well as his No. 44 jersey by the [[Atlanta Hawks]].\n\n==NBA career statistics==\n{{NBA player statistics legend|leader=y}}\n\n===Regular season===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 NBA season|1970\u201371]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| '''81''' || ... || 36.1 || .458 || ... || .800 || 3.7 || 4.4 || ... || ... || 23.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 NBA season|1971\u201372]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 66 || ... || 34.9 || .427 || ... || .811 || 3.9 || 6.0 || ... || ... || 19.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 NBA season|1972\u201373]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 79 || ... || 39.1 || .441 || ... || .800 || 4.4 || '''6.9''' || ... || ... || 26.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973-74 NBA season|1973\u201374]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973-74 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 76 || ... || 38.2 || .457 || ... || .826 || 4.9 || 5.2 || 1.5 || .2 || 27.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1974-75 NBA season|1974\u201375]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1974-75 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 79 || ... || 36.1 || .419 || ... || .811 || '''5.3''' || 6.2 || 1.5 || .2 || 21.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1975-76 NBA season|1975\u201376]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1975-76 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 62 || ... || 38.3 || '''.459''' || ... || .811 || 4.8 || 5.4 || 1.4 || '''.4''' || 25.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1976-77 NBA season|1976\u201377]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1976-77 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 73 || ... || '''41.7''' || .433 || ... || .835 || 5.1 || 5.4 || 1.2 || .3 ||style=\"background:#cfecec;\"|  '''31.1'''*\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1977-78 NBA season|1977\u201378]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1977-78 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 50 || ... || 40.8 || .444 || ... || '''.870''' || 3.6 || 6.7 || '''2.0''' || .2 || 27.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1978-79 NBA season|1978\u201379]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1978-79 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 49 || ... || 37.2 || .421 || ... || .841 || 2.5 || 5.0 || 1.2 || '''.4''' || 22.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 NBA season|1979\u201380]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 17 || ... || 30.7 || .412 || .636 || .820 || 2.4 || 3.2 || .9 || .2 || 17.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 NBA season|1979\u201380]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]\n| 26 || 4 || 17.0 || .494 || .750 || .909 || 1.5 || 1.1 || .3 || .1 || 11.5\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career\n| 658 || ... || 37.0 || .441 || .667 || .820 || 4.2 || 5.4 || 1.4 || .3 || 24.2\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| All-Star\n| 4 || 4 || 19.8 || .409 || ... || .778 || 2.0 || 3.8 || 1.0 || 0.0 || 10.8\n{{s-end}}\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971 NBA Playoffs|1971]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 5 || ... || '''39.8''' || .377 || ... || .692 || 5.2 || 4.8 || ... || ... || 22.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972 NBA Playoffs|1972]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 6 || ... || 36.5 || .446 || ... || '''.817''' || '''5.3''' || 4.7 || ... || ... || '''27.7'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973 NBA Playoffs|1973]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 6 || ... || 39.0 || .419 || ... || .794 || 4.8 || '''6.7''' || ... || ... || 26.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1980 NBA Playoffs|1980]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]\n| 9 || ... || 11.6 || '''.490''' || .333 || .667 || .9 || .7 || .3 || .0 || 6.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Career<ref name=\"Pete Maravich\"/>\n| 26 || ... || 29.1 || .423 || .333 || .784 || 3.6 || 3.8 || ... || ... || 18.7\n|-\n{{s-end}}\n\n==Later life and death==\nAfter injuries forced his retirement from the game in the fall of 1980, Maravich became a [[recluse]] for two years.

He tried the practices of [[yoga]] and [[Hinduism]], read [[Trappist]] monk [[Thomas Merton]]'s ''[[The Seven Storey Mountain]]'' and took an interest in the field of [[ufology]], the study of unidentified flying objects. He also explored [[vegetarianism]] and [[macrobiotics]].  Eventually, he became a born again believer, embracing [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christianity]].

Dobson has said that Maravich's last words, less than a minute before he died, were \"I feel great.

Only the previous year, Maravich had taken Jaeson to the 1987 NBA All-Star Game in [[Seattle]], Washington, and introduced him to [[Michael Jordan]].\n\nSince Maravich's children were very young when he died, Jackie Maravich initially shielded them from unwanted media attention, not even allowing Jaeson and Josh to attend their father's funeral.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/17/sports/ncaabasketball/17MARA.html?ex=1392354000&en=b05e4e15f6eb9dca&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=In the Name of His Father: The Journey of Pete Maravich's Son |first=Pete |last=Thamel |date=February 17, 2004 |accessdate=May 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805052426/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/17/sports/ncaabasketball/17MARA.html?ex=1392354000&en=b05e4e15f6eb9dca&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND |archivedate=August 5, 2009 }}</ref> However, a proclivity to basketball seemed to be an inherited trait.

Obsessively, Maravich spent hours practicing ball control tricks, passes, head fakes, and long-range shots.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMaravich played high school [[varsity team|varsity]] ball at [[Daniel High School]] in [[Central, South Carolina]], a year before being old enough to attend the school.  While at Daniel from 1961 to 1963, Maravich participated in the school's first-ever game against a team from an all-black school. In 1963 his father departed from his position as head basketball coach at [[Clemson University]] and joined the coaching staff at [[North Carolina State University]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The Maravich family's subsequent move to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], allowed Pete to attend [[Needham B. Broughton High School]].<ref name=\":0\" />  His high school years also saw the birth of his famous moniker.  From his habit of shooting the ball from his side, as if he were holding a [[revolver]], Maravich became known as \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich. He graduated from Needham B. Broughton High School in 1965 and then attended [[Southwood College|Edwards Military Institute]], where he averaged 33 points per game. Pete never liked school and did not like Edwards Military institute. It was known that Press Maravich was extremely protective of Maravich and would guard against any issue that may come up during his adolescence. Press threatened to shoot Pete with a 45 caliber gun if he drank or got into trouble.<ref name=\":0\" /> Maravich was 6 feet 4 inches in high school and was getting ready to play in college when his father took a coaching position at Louisiana State University.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==College career==\nAt that time NCAA rules prohibited first-year students from playing at varsity level, which forced Maravich to play on the freshman team. In his first game, Maravich put up 50 [[Point (basketball)|points]], 14 [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and 11 [[Assist (basketball)|assists]] against [[Southeastern Louisiana University|Southeastern Louisiana College]].<ref name=\"Federman\">{{cite book | first = Wayne | last =Federman | last2= Terrill |first2=Marshall |last3=Maravich |first3=Jackie | title = Maravich | page = 68 | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-894963-52-0 }}</ref>\n[[File:Pete Maravich 1967.jpeg|thumb|160px|Maravich at LSU in 1967]]\n\nIn only three years playing on the varsity team (and under his father's coaching) at LSU, Maravich scored 3,667 points\u20141,138 of those in 1967\u201368, 1,148 in 1968\u201369, and 1,381 in 1969-70\u2014while averaging 43.8, 44.2, and 44.5 points per game, respectively.

Retrieved June 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nMaravich's long-standing collegiate scoring record is particularly notable when three factors are taken into account:\n*First, because of the [[NCAA]] rules that prohibited him from taking part in varsity competition during his first year as a student, Maravich was prevented from adding to his career record for a full quarter of his time at LSU.

This significant difference has raised speculation regarding just how much higher his records would be, given his long-range shooting ability and how such a component might have altered his play.

(A time limit on ball possession speeds up play, mandates an additional number of field goal attempts, eliminates [[Stalling (gaming)|stalling]], and increases the number of possessions throughout the game, all resulting in higher overall scoring.)<ref name=nytimes />\n\nMore than 40 years later, however, many of his NCAA and LSU records still stand. Maravich was a three-time All-American. Though he never appeared in the NCAA tournament, Maravich played a key role in turning around a lackluster program that had posted a 3\u201320 record in the season prior to his arrival.

In fact, Maravich's flamboyant style stood in stark contrast to the conservative play of Hudson and star center [[Walt Bellamy]].  And it did not help that many of the veteran players resented the $1.9 million contract that Maravich received from the team\u2014a very large salary at that time.<ref name=\"NBAhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/maravich_bio.html|title=Pete Maravich Bio|date=|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMaravich appeared in 81 games and averaged 23.2 points per contest\u2014good enough to earn [[NBA All-Rookie Team]] honors.  And he managed to blend his style with his teammates, so much so that Hudson set a career high by scoring 26.8 points per game.  But the team stumbled to a 36\u201346 record\u201412 wins fewer than in the previous season.  Still, the Hawks qualified for the playoffs, where they lost to the [[New York Knicks]] in the first round.\n\nMaravich struggled somewhat during his second season.  His scoring average dipped to 19.3 points per game, and the Hawks finished with another disappointing 36\u201346 record.  Once again they qualified for the playoffs, and once again they were eliminated in the first round.  However, Atlanta fought hard against the [[Boston Celtics]], with Maravich averaging 27.7 points in the series.\n\nMaravich erupted in his third season, averaging 26.1 points (5th in the NBA) and dishing out 6.9 assists per game (6th in the NBA).  With 2,063 points, he combined with Hudson (2,029 points) to become only the second set of teammates in league history to each score over 2,000 points in a single season.<ref>[[Elgin Baylor]] and [[Jerry West]] were the first to accomplish this feat in the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]' 1964\u201365 season.

However, the season was good enough to earn Maravich his first-ever appearance in the [[NBA All-Star Game]], and also All-NBA Second Team honors.\n\nThe following season (1973\u201374) was his best yet\u2014at least in terms of individual accomplishments.  Maravich posted 27.7 points per game\u2014second in the league behind [[Bob McAdoo]]\u2014and earned his second appearance in the All-Star Game.  However, Atlanta sank to a disappointing 35\u201347 record and missed the postseason entirely.\n\n===New Orleans Jazz===\n[[File:Pete Maravich 1977.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Maravich playing for the Jazz in 1977]]\nIn the summer of 1974, an expansion franchise was preparing for its first season of competition in the NBA.  The New Orleans Jazz were looking for something or someone to generate excitement among their new basketball fans. With his exciting style of play, Maravich was seen as the perfect man for the job. Additionally, he was already a celebrity in the state due to accomplishments at LSU.  To acquire Maravich, the Jazz traded two players and four draft picks to Atlanta.\n\nThe expansion team struggled mightily in its first season.  Maravich managed to score 21.5 points per game, but shot a career-worst 41.9 percent from the floor. The Jazz posted a 23\u201359 record, worst in the NBA.\n\nJazz management did its best to give Maravich a better supporting cast. The team posted a 38\u201344 record in its second season (1975\u201376) but did not qualify for postseason play, despite the dramatic improvement.  Maravich struggled with injuries that limited him to just 62 games that season, but he averaged 25.9 points per contest (third behind McAdoo and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]) and continued his crowd-pleasing antics. He was elected to the [[All-NBA First Team]] that year.\n\nThe following season (1976\u201377) was his most productive in the NBA.  He led the league in scoring with an average of 31.1 points per game.  He scored 40 points or more in 13 games,<ref>At the time, [[Tiny Archibald]]'s 18 games of 40+ points in 1972\u201373 was the only total higher by a guard.</ref> and 50 or more in 4 games.<ref>The most ever by a guard, until [[Michael Jordan]] did it 8 times in 1986\u201387. Jordan would go on to get 4 or more 50+ point games in three more seasons; [[Kobe Bryant]] is the only other guard to reach this mark, 6 times in 2005\u201306, and a record 10 times in 2006\u201307.</ref> His 68-point masterpiece against the Knicks<ref>[http://espn.go.com/classic/s/moment010225maravich.html \"Pete Maravich's 68 points a record\" by Larry Schwartz on ESPN Classic], November 19, 2003</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=177319 |title='Pistol' Pete Maravich \u2013 Career Recap \u2013 LSUsports.net \u2013 The Official Web Site of LSU Tigers Athletics |publisher=LSUsports.net |date= |accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref> was at the time the most points ever scored by a guard in a single game, and only two players at any position had ever scored more: [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Elgin Baylor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbahoopsonline.com/History/Leagues/NBA/pointsingame.html |title=Most points by 1 player in a NBA game, 50 point games in NBA history |publisher=Nbahoopsonline.com |date= |accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref> Baylor was head coach of the Jazz at that time.\n\nMaravich earned his third all-star game appearance and was honored as All-NBA First Team for the second consecutive season.\n\nThe following season, injuries to both knees forced him to miss 32 games during the 1977\u201378 season. Despite being robbed of some quickness and athleticism, he still managed to score 27.0 points per game, and he also added 6.7 assists per contest, his highest average as a member of the Jazz.  Many of those assists went to new teammate [[Truck Robinson]], who had joined the franchise as a free agent during the off-season. In his first year in New Orleans, he averaged 22.7 points and a league-best 15.7 rebounds per game. His presence prevented opponents from focusing their defensive efforts entirely on Maravich, and it lifted the Jazz to a 39\u201343 record\u2014just short of making the club's first-ever appearance in the playoffs.\n\nKnee problems plagued Maravich for the rest of his career. He played in just 49 games during the 1978\u201379 season. He scored 22.6 points per game that season and earned his fifth and final All-Star appearance. But his scoring and passing abilities were severely impaired. The team struggled on the court, and faced serious financial trouble as well. Management became desperate to make some changes. The Jazz traded Robinson to the [[Phoenix Suns]], receiving draft picks and some cash in return. However, in 1979, team owner [[Sam Battistone]] moved the Jazz to [[Salt Lake City]].\n\n===Final season===\nThe Utah Jazz began play in the 1979\u201380 season.  Maravich moved with the team to [[Salt Lake City]], but his knee problems were worse than ever.  He appeared in 17 games early in the season, but his injuries prevented him from practicing much, and new coach [[Tom Nissalke]] had a strict rule that players who didn't practice were not allowed to play in games.  Thus, Maravich was parked on the bench for 24 straight games, much to the dismay of Utah fans and to Maravich himself.  During that time, [[Adrian Dantley]] emerged as the team's franchise player.\n\nThe Jazz placed Maravich on [[Waivers (NBA)|waivers]] in January 1980.  He signed with the Celtics, the top team in the league that year, led by rookie superstar [[Larry Bird]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Linda Hamilton |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595102509,00.html |title=25 years later the Jazz are going strong |publisher=Deseret.news.com |date=November 2, 2004 |accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref>  Maravich adjusted to a new role as part-time contributor, giving Boston a \"hired gun\" off the bench. He helped the team post a 61\u201321 record in the regular season, best in the league.  And, for the first time since his early career in Atlanta, Maravich was able to participate in the NBA playoffs.  He appeared in nine games during that postseason, but the Celtics were upended by [[Julius Erving]] and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the Eastern Conference finals, four games to one.\n\nRealizing that his knee problems would never go away, Maravich retired at the end of that season. The NBA instituted the 3-point shot just in time for Maravich's last season in the league. He had always been famous for his long-range shooting, and his final year provided an official statistical gauge of his abilities. Between his limited playing time in Utah and Boston, he made 10 of 15 3-point shots, giving him a career 66.7% completion rate behind the arc.\n\nDuring his ten-year career in the NBA, Maravich played in 658 games, averaging 24.2 points and 5.4 assists per contest.  In 1987, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], and his No. 7 jersey has been retired by both the Jazz and the [[New Orleans Pelicans]], as well as his No. 44 jersey by the [[Atlanta Hawks]].\n\n==NBA career statistics==\n{{NBA player statistics legend|leader=y}}\n\n===Regular season===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 NBA season|1970\u201371]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| '''81''' || ... || 36.1 || .458 || ... || .800 || 3.7 || 4.4 || ... || ... || 23.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 NBA season|1971\u201372]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 66 || ... || 34.9 || .427 || ... || .811 || 3.9 || 6.0 || ... || ... || 19.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 NBA season|1972\u201373]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 79 || ... || 39.1 || .441 || ... || .800 || 4.4 || '''6.9''' || ... || ... || 26.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973-74 NBA season|1973\u201374]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973-74 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 76 || ... || 38.2 || .457 || ... || .826 || 4.9 || 5.2 || 1.5 || .2 || 27.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1974-75 NBA season|1974\u201375]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1974-75 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 79 || ... || 36.1 || .419 || ... || .811 || '''5.3''' || 6.2 || 1.5 || .2 || 21.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1975-76 NBA season|1975\u201376]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1975-76 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 62 || ... || 38.3 || '''.459''' || ... || .811 || 4.8 || 5.4 || 1.4 || '''.4''' || 25.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1976-77 NBA season|1976\u201377]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1976-77 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 73 || ... || '''41.7''' || .433 || ... || .835 || 5.1 || 5.4 || 1.2 || .3 ||style=\"background:#cfecec;\"|  '''31.1'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1977-78 NBA season|1977\u201378]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1977-78 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 50 || ... || 40.8 || .444 || ... || '''.870''' || 3.6 || 6.7 || '''2.0''' || .2 || 27.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1978-79 NBA season|1978\u201379]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1978-79 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 49 || ... || 37.2 || .421 || ... || .841 || 2.5 || 5.0 || 1.2 || '''.4''' || 22.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 NBA season|1979\u201380]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 17 || ... || 30.7 || .412 || .636 || .820 || 2.4 || 3.2 || .9 || .2 || 17.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 NBA season|1979\u201380]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]\n| 26 || 4 || 17.0 || .494 || .750 || .909 || 1.5 || 1.1 || .3 || .1 || 11.5\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career\n| 658 || ... || 37.0 || .441 || .667 || .820 || 4.2 || 5.4 || 1.4 || .3 || 24.2\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| All-Star\n| 4 || 4 || 19.8 || .409 || ... || .778 || 2.0 || 3.8 || 1.0 || 0.0 || 10.8\n{{s-end}}\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971 NBA Playoffs|1971]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 5 || ... || '''39.8''' || .377 || ... || .692 || 5.2 || 4.8 || ... || ... || 22.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972 NBA Playoffs|1972]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 6 || ... || 36.5 || .446 || ... || '''.817''' || '''5.3''' || 4.7 || ... || ... || '''27.7'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973 NBA Playoffs|1973]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 6 || ... || 39.0 || .419 || ... || .794 || 4.8 || '''6.7''' || ... || ... || 26.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1980 NBA Playoffs|1980]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]\n| 9 || ... || 11.6 || '''.490''' || .333 || .667 || .9 || .7 || .3 || .0 || 6.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Career<ref name=\"Pete Maravich\"/>\n| 26 || ... || 29.1 || .423 || .333 || .784 || 3.6 || 3.8 || ... || ... || 18.7\n|-\n{{s-end}}\n\n==Later life and death==\nAfter injuries forced his retirement from the game in the fall of 1980, Maravich became a [[recluse]] for two years.

Receipt of the Gairdner is traditionally considered a precursor to winning the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]]; as of 2018, 86 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to prior Gairdner recipients. \n\nCanada Gairdner International Awards are given annually in the amount of $100,000 (each) payable in Canadian funds and can be awarded to residents of any country in the world. A joint award may be given for the same discovery or contribution to medical science, but in that case each awardee receives a full prize.<ref>[http://www.gairdner.org/ Official Canada Gairdner International Award Web Site]</ref>\n\n== Past winners ==\n\n*1959 [[Alfred Blalock]], {{ill|Charles Ragan|de}}, [[Harry M.
