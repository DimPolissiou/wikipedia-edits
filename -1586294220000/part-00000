Also Karen is used to say \"OKIE KAREN\" when youre in doubt. In [[English language|English]], it is a feminine name derived from the name [[Catherine]], like other similar [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] names. In [[Kurdistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Armenia]], however, it is a masculine name deriving from other non-Germanic languages. The name is also found in modern [[Africa]], as well as in [[Asia]].\n\n==English==\nKaren entered the English language from Danish, where it has been a short form of \"Katherine\" since medieval times.<ref name=\"Onomastics\">{{cite journal | url=https://repozitorij.ffos.hr/islandora/object/ffos:1830 | title=Onomastics as evidence of linguistic influence | author=Fijok, Ivana |year=2012}}</ref> It became popular in the English-speaking world in the 1940s. The name Karen was one of the top 10 names for girls born in the [[United States]] during the 1950s and 1960s, peaking as the third most popular girl's name in 1965.<ref>{{citation|last=Davidson|first=Andrew|url=http://www.nameplayground.com/Karen|title=Population Statistics for Karen|year=2007|publisher=nameplayground.com|location=Raleigh, NC}}</ref>\n\nVariants include Caja, Kaja (Danish), Caren, Caryn, Karena, Kaat,  Karin, Karyn. The name is used in the Danish, Arabic, Dutch, Hebrew, Norwegian, German and English languages.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/karen-1 \u0412ehind the Name]</ref>\n\nSince the late 2010s, the name \"Karen\" had been used in a similar vein as \"[[Becky (slang)|Becky]]\", to refer to a busybody middle-aged woman making formal complaints about trivial activities.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2018/01/karen-sharon-becky-and-chad-how-it-feels-when-your-name-becomes-meme|title=Karen, Sharon, Becky, and Chad: How it feels when your name becomes a meme|author=Amelia Tait|date=2018-01-24|magazine=New Statesman}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/lifestyle/2019/05/karen-how-one-meme-ruined-a-mother-s-favourite-baby-name.html|title='Karen': How one meme ruined a mother's favourite baby name|author=Lana Andelane|date=2019-05-30|publisher=Newshub}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.georgetakei.com/people-who-know-chads-karens-2639964007.html|title=People Who Know Chads And Karens Admit How They Feel About Their Names Becoming Insults|author=Thomas Dane|date=2019-08-23|publisher=GeorgeTakei.com}}</ref>\n\n==In Armenia, Iran and Kurdistan ==\n\nIn [[Armenia]], [[Iran]], and [[Kurdistan]] ''Karen'' is a common masculine given name.\n \nThe masculine given name ''Karen'' derived from the Persian name of [[House of Karen]] (or Caren), one of the [[Seven Parthian clans|seven aristocratic families]] of the Mads Empire (Medians- Medes), who settled in Western parts of Achaemenid Empire. Several Persian princes named Karen are known before and after the Islamic period. The Karen house ruled the [[Tabaristan]] region of Iran, which approximately corresponds to the current provinces of [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] state and [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]]. Moreover, Karen means a brave (or a valorous) man in Persian.\n\nKar or car (\u06a9\u0627\u0631) means work or job in [[Persian language|Persian]] and Kurdish. En (\u06cc\u0646) is an archaic suffix, which acts similar to (ist) in English. Therefore, the literal meaning of the name is he who sees/gets the job done. The last son of Kaveh the Blacksmith was named Karen. Karen had lost 12 older brothers to the evil Emperor Zahak, but survived to see the end of a revolution initiated by his father. According to the legend in Ferdowsi's ''Shahnameh,'' Zahak was cursed with two snakes on his shoulders. Zahak was advised to feed the snakes using brains of young boys to keep the curse from growing.

Several Persian princes named Karen are known before and after the Islamic period. The Karen house ruled the [[Tabaristan]] region of Iran, which approximately corresponds to the current provinces of [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] state and [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]]. Moreover, Karen means a brave (or a valorous) man in Persian.\n\nKar or car (\u06a9\u0627\u0631) means work or job in [[Persian language|Persian]] and Kurdish. En (\u06cc\u0646) is an archaic suffix, which acts similar to (ist) in English. Therefore, the literal meaning of the name is he who sees/gets the job done. The last son of Kaveh the Blacksmith was named Karen. Karen had lost 12 older brothers to the evil Emperor Zahak, but survived to see the end of a revolution initiated by his father. According to the legend in Ferdowsi's ''Shahnameh,'' Zahak was cursed with two snakes on his shoulders. Zahak was advised to feed the snakes using brains of young boys to keep the curse from growing. Kaveh managed to dismantle Zahak's reign and save his last son with the help of a Persian king.     \n\nIn [[Armenian language|Armenian]], ''Karen'' is also derived from the ancient Armenian masculine given name '''Kar'''. The masculine given name '''[[Garen (disambiguation)|Garen]]''' is a [[Western Armenian]] form of the [[Eastern Armenian]] ''Karen''.\n\nThe masculine given name ''Karen'' was mentioned by the prominent Armenian historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] (ca. 410\u2013490s AD; Armenian: \u0544\u0578\u057e\u057d\u0565\u057d \u053d\u0578\u0580\u0565\u0576\u0561\u0581\u056b) in his book ''[[History of Armenia (book)|History of Armenia]]''.<ref>History of the Armenia by Movses Khorenatsi: Book_2_#28 and Book_2_#68</ref>\n\n''Karen'' can also be a surname.\n\n==In Asia==\nIn [[Asia]], ''Karen'' is a feminine given name.

It saw action at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], before moving the the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]]. It returned to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] to fight in the German [[Spring Offensive]] and the victorious Allied [[Hundred Days Offensive]].\n\n==Recruitment==\n[[File:30a Sammlung Eybl Gro\u00dfbritannien. Alfred Leete (1882\u20131933) Britons (Kitchener) wants you (Briten Kitchener braucht Euch). 1914 (Nachdruck), 74 x 50 cm. (Slg.Nr. 552).jpg|right|thumb|[[Alfred Leete]]'s recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.]]\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular [[British Army]], and the newly-appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Earl Kitchener of Khartoum]] issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.<ref>Army Council Instructions No 32 (6 August) and No 37 (7 August).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8; Appendix I.</ref><ref name = Grist53>Grist, p. 53.</ref> A flood of volunteers poured into the recruiting offices across the country and were formed into 'Service' battalions of the county regiments. However, the Bristol Chamber of Commerce considered that the city's response was inadequate and formed a Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee under the leadership of the former Lord Mayor, Sir [[Herbert Ashman]], to encourage enlistment. The city's Colston Hall was opened as a recruiting centre on 14 August, and 2274 men enlisted by 2 September. Eighty men calling themselves the Weston Comrades Company also joined from [[Weston-super-Mare]]. It was clear that many of these men wanted to serve together in a special Bristol battalion, similar to other '[[Pals battalion]]s' being formed around the country. The [[War Office]] (WO) gave the committee authority to form the '''Bristol Battalion''', [[Gloucestershire Regiment]], on 30 August. Later in the year it became part of Kitchener's Fifth New Army (K5) and was officially numbered as the '''12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (Bristol)''', but the subtitle was usually rendered as 'Bristol's Own'. The recruiting committee encouraged 'mercantile and professional' men to apply, both through reasons of social exclusiveness and with a view to Kitchener's directive that workers in vital industries could not be spared. The first commanding officer (CO) was William Burges, who had retired from command of the 3rd Militia Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment some years before. Several of the other officers appointed had experience in the Regular or Auxiliary forces, and a number of junior officers had been members of their school or university [[Officer Training Corps]].<ref>Marks, pp. 8\u201320, 32\u20133, 39.</ref><ref name = Grist54>Grist, pp. 54\u20135.</ref><ref name = Daniell227>Daniell, p. 227.</ref><ref>Army Council Instructions, October 1914, Appendix VIII; December 1914, Appendix III.</ref><ref name = Frederick>Frederick, p. 102.</ref><ref name = James>James, p. 72.</ref><ref name = TrailGlos>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/gloucestershire-regiment/ Glosters at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = GlosCO>[http://www.ww1infantrycos.co.uk/gloucs.html Glosters at Infantry Battalion COs.]</ref>\n\n==Training==\nThe rush of recruits had overwhelmed the Army's ability to absorb them, so the Pals Battalions of K5 were left for some time in the hands of the recruiting committees. Initially the Bristol men lived at home and drilled by squads at Colston Hall in their civilian clothes, distinguished only by a lapel badge bearing the words 'New Bristol Battalion Gloucestershire Regt'. They then began battalion drills at the Artillery Grounds in [[Whiteladies Road]], the headquarters of the [[Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery|I South Midland (Gloucestershire) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery]] of the [[Territorial Force]]. But in late September the recruiting committee persuaded the WO to buy up the site of the abandoned Bristol International Exhibition in Greville Smyth Park, the buildings of which were converted into barracks by the [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Army Service Corps]]. The 'Weston Comrades' joined the rest of the battalion here in November and were posted to D Company. Some of the battalion's best men were already being posted away, for officer training for example, and on 30 November the WO authorised the recruiting committee to raise a fifth, reserve company (E Company); F Company was raised as a further reserve in April 1915. Old rifles had been issued to the battalion for drill purposes, with just a few modern [[Lee-Enfield|Lee-Enfield]] .303 SMLE rifles for musketry training. Uniforms were finally received in December 1914. In March 1915 the battalion began field training by companies at [[Chipping Sodbury]].<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 22\u201331, 40\u201351, 69, 71.</ref><ref>[http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Gloucestershire/TownBristol.htm Bristol at Drill Hall Project.]</ref>\n\nThe locally-raised units to form K5 were assigned to brigades on 10 December 1914: the Bristol Battalion was brigaded with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd [[Birmingham Pals]] (later 14th, 15th and 16th (Service) Battalions, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]). The brigade was\ninitially numbered 116th Brigade in 39th Division, but in April 1915 the WO decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units to train reinforcements for the K1\u2013K3 units, and on 27 April the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the designations of the K4 formations. The short-lived 39th Division thus became [[32nd Division (United Kingdom)|32nd Division]] and 116th Brigade became [[95th Brigade (United Kingdom)|95th Brigade]].<ref name = TrailGlos/><ref>Army Council Instruction No 101 (10 December 1914).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix I2</ref><ref name = Becke32>Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 21\u201328.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 64.</ref>\n\nIn May 1915 the brigade was to have gathered in [[Shropshire]], but the ground selected at [[Prees Heath Army Camp|Prees Heath]] proved unsuitable for brigade training and on 23 June the 12th Gloucesters left Bristol to join 95th Brigade at [[Wensley, North Yorkshire]]. The two reserve or depot companies joined those of the Birmingham Pals at [[Sutton Coldfield]] to continue training. Brigade training started in earnest at Wensley, and 12th Gloucesters was finally adopted by the WO on 23 June 1915. Previously, most of the shooting had been on miniature ranges with .22 ammunition; now the men began weekly musketry courses (12th Gloucesters at [[Whitburn, Tyne and Wear|Whitburn]]) although many of the rifles were worn and defective. In August 32nd Division gathered on [[Salisbury Plain]] to begin final battle training, with 12th Gloucesters in camp at [[Codford]].<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 79\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe battalion's strength at this time was about 1550, or more than 50 per cent over establishment; during August a large number of skilled men were transferred to other arms, others went to officer cadet training units, and older or unfit men were sent to the 15th (Reserve) Battalion at Sutton Coldfield into which the depot companies had been absorbed. Now that the battalion was almost ready to go overseas, the 59-year-old Lt-Col Burges was ordered to remain in the UK. He was succeeded in command by Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], a former Regular Army officer who was now [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Finsbury Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury Central]].<ref name = James/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, pp. 89\u201390, 95.</ref>\n\n==Service==\nOn 11 November 1915 32nd Division was ordered to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and 12th Gloucesters landed at [[Boulogne]] on 21 November. By 28 November the division had concentrated round [[Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher]], north of the [[Somme (river)|River Somme]]. For its initiation into trench warfare with experienced units of [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]], 12th Gloucesters moved into a section of trenches thick with mud at [[Maricourt, Somme|Maricourt]] on 6 December. A Company was with 1st Bn [[East Surrey Regiment]] for instruction, and B Company with 2nd Bn [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. 95th Brigade was exchanged with a brigade from 5th Division on 26 December as part of a policy to even-up experience levels between formations. The Pals battalions were scattered among 5th Division's brigades; although 12th Gloucesters remained with 95th Brigade, it was now brigaded with three Regular Army battalions that had been fighting since the beginning of the war.<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Grist, pp. 97\u20138.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 95\u2013106.</ref><ref name = Becke5>Becke, Part 1, pp, 65\u201371.</ref>\n[[File:Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg|thumb|right|The high street of Guillemont, captured on 3 September.]]\n===Somme===\n5th Division moved to the [[Arras]] sector in mid-February 1916, and 12th Gloucesters took over dry, well-made trenches with deep dug-outs, and lived in cellars in Arras when out of the line.<ref>Grist, p. 100.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 111\u20135.</ref> Steel helmets began to be issued to British troops early in 1916, but there were great shortages: Lt-Col Archer-Shee used his position as an MP and own observations in the trenches to ask embarrassing questions of the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]].<ref name = Daniell227/>\n\nThe battalion's first real taste of offensive warfare came during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The offensive had begun on 1 July, and 5th Division took over part of the line in the Delville Wood sector near [[Longueval]] between 18 and 20 July, where 95th Brigade was to deal with German strongpoints in the orchards. When the commander of 95th Brigade, [[Brigadier_(United_Kingdom)#Historical_rank_of_brigadier_general|Brigadier-General]] C.R. Ballard, was wounded on 20 July, Lt-Col Archer-Shee took temporary command until Brig-Gen Lord Esme Gordon-Lennox arrived to take over.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Marks, pp. 118\u20139.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 106\u20137, 141.</ref> From 23 to 26 July the battalion was in the front line and was heavily shelled, with [[High explosive shell|high explosive]], [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas]], suffering many casualties. It went back into Longueval on 28 July, when the line was advanced to 'Duke Street' without opposition, but shelling was heavier than ever. At 15.30 next day 95th Brigade attacked to complete the capture of Longueval in support of the main attack (the [[Battle of Delville Wood]]). 12th Gloucesters put in two companies on the left of the brigade after a half-hour bombardment, and they successfully advanced the line some {{convert|500|yd|m}} beyond Duke Street. The battalion held these positions until relieved next day.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 140\u20131.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 119\u201327.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, p. 160.</ref>\n[[File:Glosters_at_Guillemont.png|thumb|right|12th Bn Gloucesters' attack at Guillemont, 3 September 1916.]]\nThe phase of the offensive that began on 22 July culminated in the [[Battle of Guillemont]]. The village of [[Guillemont]] had withstood repeated British attacks, but 5th Division made a new attempt on 3 September. The bombardment began at 08.30 and the attack began at 12.00, with the men advancing behind a [[Creeping barrage]] (a recent innovation) moving at {{convert|50|yd|m}} a minute; the men were instructed to keep within {{convert|25|yd|m}} of the bursting shells. However, a flanking position at Falfemont Farm, which should have been captured in the morning, was still in enemy hands and threatened 95th Brigade's advance. The two leading companies of 12th Gloucesters took their first objective, a sunken lane, and found the [[Dugout_(shelter)#World_War_I|dugouts]] beyond to be unoccupied. But then they came under [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire from a machine gun off to the right in the Falfemont direction, which caused numerous casualties before A Company eliminated it. At 12.50 the battalion moved on to its second objective, the German line between Wedge Wood and the south of Guillemont village, which was taken without too much trouble. It then moved on at 14.50 to the third objective, a sunken lane running north from Wedge Wood towards [[Ginchy]]. Amidst the devastation of the battlefield C Company mistook Leuze Wood for Wedge Wood, got too far ahead and were caught by their own artillery fire. Although no enemy could be seen at Leuze Wood, the battalion was ordered to halt and consolidate its position rather than push into an awkward [[Salient (military)|salient]].<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151>Grist, pp. 151\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 132\u201340.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 252\u20134; Sketch 32.</ref>\n[[File:The_Battle_of_the_Somme,_July-november_1916_Q4287.jpg|thumb|left|12th Gloucesters moving up in support near Ginchy, 25 September 1916.]]\nThe 12th Gloucesters was now only 300 strong and took no active part in the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette|Flers-Courcelette]] (18\u201322 September) though the battalion was later awarded it as a [[Battle honour]]. Although the battalion had been told that it would not have to go back into the line, it received a draft of 116 reinforcements and was given a role in 95th Brigade's next attack, the [[Battle of Morval]] on 25 September. The battalion was in support while 1st Bn [[Devonshire Regiment]] and 1st Bn East Surreys suffered heavy casualties taking the first and second objectives. 12th Gloucesters and 2nd [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] then moved through the village of Morval itself and dug in on the far side. The battalion's casualties were 12 killed and 61 wounded. The next night the battalion was relieved and went into camp in Happy Valley.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151/><ref>Marks, pp. 146\u20138.</ref>\n<ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 373\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lt-Col Archer-Shee, of the 950 members of 12th Gloucesters who entered the Battle of the Somme, 736 became casualties.<ref>Marks, p. 149.</ref> After the end of the Somme offensive the battalion continued to do duty in the appalling trenches in the area, alternating with tents in devastated [[Mametz, Somme|Mametz Wood]]. 5th Division moved to the [[B\u00e9thune]] sector in October and spent the next six months in this quieter area. On 22 October Lt-Col Archer-Shee returned to the UK for treatment to an old wound and was succeeded on 20 November by Lt-Col Robert Rawson, a Regular officer of the Gloucesters who had commanded 6th [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] for two years. Rawson also acted as 95th Brigade's commander during the winter. Archer-Shee returned to the battalion in January 1917, but resigned his command on 10 February 1917 to devote himself to his parliamentary duties. Rawson returned from Brigade HQ on 18 March and took over full command.<ref>Grist, pp. 182\u20137.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 150\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Arras===\n12th Gloucesters was in reserve to the [[Canadian Corps]] for the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] on 9 April. Then on the night of 4/5 May, as the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] continued, 95th Brigade relieved a Canadian Brigade that had captured [[Fresnoy-en-Gohelle|Fresnoy]]. Because of casualties, 12th Gloucesters was reduced to three companies, so it had two companies of 1st [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (DCLI) under its command in order to hold the wood north of the town. During 7 May the British trenches were heavily bombarded, then that night two successive attacks came in. 12th Gloucesters repulsed the first at 03.45 (which may have been an unplanned clash as the German storm troops moved into position) but the battalion was overwhelmed by the second attack at 05.45, which completely broke through the British lines and recaptured Fresnoy. Rawson sent up D Company DCLI and his own C Company to try to restore the situation, followed later by D Company 12th Gloucesters, but all they could do was hold a sunken lane behind the lost positions until relieved at 10.00. The battalion lost 389 casualties, including 94 dead; A and B Companies had completely disappeared, killed or captured, and there were no officers left in the frontline companies.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Falls, ''1917'', Vol I, pp. 520\u20131.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 188\u201393.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 157\u201365.</ref>\n\n===Ypres===\n[[File:Hill-62-Museum-Tranches-Ypres-Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved trenches at [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62]]: when 12th Gloucesters were stationed here it was 'an unimaginably foul and miserable place'. There were no trees left and the battalion was sheltering in shell craters and dugouts.<ref>Grist, p. 213.</ref>]]\nThe battered battalions were slowly built up to strength and trained hard, but 12th Gloucesters did not see major action again until the latter stages of the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Ypres Offensive]]. 5th Division moved into [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps']] area on the night of 2/3 October during the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]], then attacked on 4 October (the [[Battle of Broodseinde]]). Launched at 06.00, 95th Brigade advanced {{convert|500|yd|m}} with the help of a tank to deal with German [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]]. 12th Gloucesters had been in reserve to the attacking battalion, 1st [[East Surrey Regiment]], and moved three companies up into the Surreys' forming-up trenches 40 minutes after Zero hour, where they suffered badly from the German counter-barrage. Later in the morning C Company was sent up to help 1st [[Devonshire Regiment]]. The following day the battalion held the captured line, under continuing artillery fire. In preparation for the next attack (the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]] on 9 October), 12th Gloucesters was in [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62|Sanctuary Wood]], where it was under observation and artillery fire from the enemy and movement was restricted to duckboard tracks. On 8 October the battalion was split, with two companies providing carrying parties and the other two in the support line behind 1st Bn [[Cheshire Regiment]]. When the attack was delivered, the companies in Sanctuary Wood provided carrying and burial parties, while the two in the support line were pinned by artillery and could not be relieved until 10/11 October. Despite not actually attacking itself, 12th Gloucesters lost 359 casualties (150 from gas), of whom 88 died, in the period 1\u201312 October.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 314, 334.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 210\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 167\u201370.</ref>\n\nWhile 5th Division continued to attack (the Second Battle of Passchendaele), 12th Gloucesters remained out of the line after Poelcapelle, resting, absorbing a few reinforcements, and training. It spent two short spells holding the line, suffering only light casualties, and then the whole division was pulled out. At the end of October Lt-Col Rawson left the battalion for a six-month tour of duty in the UK and the second-in-command, Maj H.A. Colt, was promoted to succeed him.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 214.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 170\u20131.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nFollowing the Austro-German breakthrough at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], the BEF was required to release divisions to reinforce the [[Italian Army]]. On 23 November, 5th Division was warned that it would be moved to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Entrainment began at [[Hesdin]] on 27 November, but after A and C Companies were got away, B and D were held back under orders to move at a moment's notice to the [[Cambrai]] sector, where the German counter-attack following the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] threatened to break through. The fighting died down after 3 December, and the two companies were released. 5th Division completed its concentration to the east of the [[Brenta (river)|River Brenta]], not far from [[Padua]], by 20 December. When 5th Division took over part of the line along the [[Piave (river)|River Piave]] on 27 January 1918 12th Gloucesters relieved an Italian unit, and was ordered to wear Italian helmets to conceal the fact that British troops had taken over. The battalion carried out several fighting patrols against the opposing Hungarian units until 5th Division was relieved on 18 March.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 352, 391.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 222\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 174\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Spring Offensive===\nThe Germans began their [[Spring Offensive]] on the Western Front on 21 March and achieved rapid successes. On 24 March 5th Division was warned that it would return to France. Entrainment began on 1 April, 12th Gloucesters started on 2 April, and the division completed its concentration between [[Doullens]] and [[Fr\u00e9vent]] on 9 April.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 224, 267.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 181.</ref>\n[[File:British_Lewis_gun_team_Battle_of_Hazebrouck_1918_IWM_Q_10902.jpg|thumb|right|A British Lewis gun team at the Battle of Hazebrouck]]\nThe second phase of the Spring Offensive (Operation Georgette, or the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)|Battle of the Lys]]) had opened on 7 April and 5th Division took up positions from the Lys Canal to the [[Nieppe|Forest of Nieppe]], where it came under immediate attack (the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)#Battle_of_Hazebrouck_(12\u201315_April)|Battle of Hazebrouck]]). On 13 April 12th Gloucesters held off one German attack for the loss of 76 casualties, including 18 killed. By 15 April the battalion was well dug in and held off another attack. The battalion was out of the line from 16 to 21 April, and then carried out an attack of its own on 22 April. Close behind a creeping barrage it captured Le Vert Bois Farm (later renamed 'Gloucester Farm') without serious opposition, but it took all day to take Le Vert Bois itself. The battalion captured three German machine guns and 39 prisoners. The Germans abandoned Operation Georgette a few days later. <ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 267.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 182\u20135.</ref>\n\nOn 28 June the British launched a limited operation to improve their positions along the edge of the Nieppe Forest. 12th Gloucesters was tasked with capturing Le Cornet Perdu, moving up in darkness to attack at 06.00. It took all its objectives by 09.30, and pushed patrols up to the PLate Becq river, though a handful of German machine guns had caused 164 casualties, of whom 45 died.<ref name = Becke5/> <ref>Grist, p. 270.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 186\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Hundred Days Offensive===\nThe [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] launched their own [[Hundred Days Offensive]] on 8 August 1918, when 5th Division was in reserve. It then came into action at the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Third Battle of Albert]] on 21 August. This was a three-phase attack, with 5th Division passing through [[37th Division (United Kingdom)|37th Division ]] for the second phase. 95th Brigade led, with 12th Gloucesters as its reserve. Once the second objective had been taken, 12th Gloucesters took over and despite having lost the barrage advanced over a mile of open country with some of 1st East Surreys and just reached the Arras\u2013[[Albert, Somme|Albert]] railway before meeting stronger opposition. Mist now hampered the artillery and tanks and the battalion was unable to push beyond the railway to the final objective. It had lost an officer and 11 other ranks killed, and nearly100 wounded. Next day the battalion consolidated, then drove off a German counter-attack at 17.30, capturing 180 prisoners and five machine guns in the process. On 23 August, reinforced by two companies of 1st DCLI, the battalion launched an attack at 11.00 behind a creeping barrage to capture the railway line itself. The Germans had numerous machine gun nests along it and caused numerous casualties before they were overrun. Having lost the barrage, the battalion was unable to advance beyond the ridge to [[Irles]], and requested reinforcements. Before they arrived, the neighbouring brigade attacked, so Lt-Col Colt led a charge by the remainder of 12th Gloucesters and the DCLI companies to capture the village, though losses were heavy: 30 men were killed and nine officers and 170 men wounded, including Lt-Col Colt (who was awarded the DSO). The previous CO, Lt-Col Rawson, returned to command the battalion.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, pp. 191, 229\u201330.</ref><ref name = Grist275>Grist, p. 275.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 189\u201393.</ref> \n\nThe weakened battalion was withdrawn into reserve while the rest of 95th Brigade attacked on 30 August (the [[Battle of the Scarpe (1918)|Battle of the Scarpe]]) and then took over holding part of the front line. 95th Brigade was relieved on 4 September after the conclusion of the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]]. Part of 5th Division went into action at the [[Battle of \u00c9pehy]] on 18 September, and  12th Gloucesters later received the battle honour despite not being engaged.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist275/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, p. 363, 493.</ref><ref name = Grist279>Grist, p, 279.</ref>\n\nAll the Allied armies began a rolling offensive all the way along the Western Front on 26 September. The BEF's [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] stormed across the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord|Canal du Nord]] on 27 September, and next morning 5th Division launched a follow-up attack. Because the designated assault brigade ([[13th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|13th Brigade]]) had suffered heavy casualties, 95th Brigade was substituted for it at short notice and only just got to the jumping-off position in time for Zero hour at 02.40. It ran into considerable opposition and 12th Gloucesters found both its flanks were open; 1st DCLI came up on the left later, but the right remained  exposed and isolated German machine gun posts had to be dealt with using [[Rifle grenade|rifle grenades]]. It was not until 08.00 that the first village was taken. The brigade then had to resort to trench warfare methods to work its way up to the second objective on the slopes of Welsh Ridge by evening. 95th Brigade was also hung up when it attacked again next day, finding the pace of the creeping barrage too fast over broken ground. By the time it was relieved on 30 September 12th Gloucesters' casualties amounted to 52, 24 of them fatal, though it had taken about 120 prisoners.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist279/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, pp. 48, 118.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nWhile 5th Division had been in Italy, the BEF's manpower shortage led to infantry brigades being reduced from four to three battalions. 5th Division's brigades had retained the four-battalion establishment, but by late 1918 the shortage of manpower was critical, and the division had to fall in line. As the only New Army battalion in 95th Brigade, 12th Gloucesters was ordered to disband and the remaining men were drafted to other units. 12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, (Bristol's Own) commenced disbandment on 19 October 1918 while the [[Battle of the Selle]] was raging. Most of D Company was posted to 14th Warwicks, which became the divisional pioneer battalion. Others went to 1st Devons and 1st DCLI. The war ended less than a month later when the [[Armistice with Germany]] came into effect.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, p. 338.</ref><ref name = Marks194>Marks, p. 194.</ref>\n\nDuring its service the battalion had suffered losses of 32 officers and 754 other ranks killed. Of the original 990 men who landed in France in November 1915, 205 had died with the battalion, and over 100 more after being posted to other units.<ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = Marks194/><ref name = DaniellApp>Daniell, Appendix I.</ref>\n\n==15th (Reserve) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment==\n15th (Reserve) Battalion was formed at Sutton Coldfield on 31 August 1915 from the depot companies of the 12th (Bristol's Own) and 14th (West of England) Battalions of the Gloucesters. The 14th (Service) Battalion was a '[[Bantam (military)|Bantam]]' battalion that had been raised by the Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee on 22 April 1915. It moved to [[Chiseldon|Chiseldon Camp]] and joined [[22nd Reserve Brigade]]. The CO from 10 August 1915 to 31 August 1916 was Lt-Col Stephen Willcock. On 1 September 1916 it became 93rd Training Reserve Battalion in 22nd Reserve Bde and on 4 July 1917 it was redesignated 262nd (Infantry) Battalion of the Training Reserve. When the Training Reserve was reorganised in late 1917, the battalion became 51st (Graduated) Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Grist, p. 56.</ref><ref>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/royal-warwickshire-regiment/ Warwicks at Long, Long Trail.]</ref>\n\n==Commanding officers==\nThe following commanded the battalion during its service:<ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, p 152 & Appendix I.</ref>\n* Lt-Col William Burges from 1 September 1914 to 12 August 1915\n* Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]] from 12 August 1915 to 22 October 1916\n* Maj W.A.R.

It saw action at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], before moving the the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]]. It returned to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] to fight in the German [[Spring Offensive]] and the victorious Allied [[Hundred Days Offensive]].\n\n==Recruitment==\n[[File:30a Sammlung Eybl Gro\u00dfbritannien. Alfred Leete (1882\u20131933) Britons (Kitchener) wants you (Briten Kitchener braucht Euch). 1914 (Nachdruck), 74 x 50 cm. (Slg.Nr. 552).jpg|right|thumb|[[Alfred Leete]]'s recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.]]\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular [[British Army]], and the newly-appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Earl Kitchener of Khartoum]] issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.<ref>Army Council Instructions No 32 (6 August) and No 37 (7 August).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8; Appendix I.</ref><ref name = Grist53>Grist, p. 53.</ref> A flood of volunteers poured into the recruiting offices across the country and were formed into 'Service' battalions of the county regiments. However, the Bristol Chamber of Commerce considered that the city's response was inadequate and formed a Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee under the leadership of the former Lord Mayor, Sir [[Herbert Ashman]], to encourage enlistment. The city's Colston Hall was opened as a recruiting centre on 14 August, and 2274 men enlisted by 2 September. Eighty men calling themselves the Weston Comrades Company also joined from [[Weston-super-Mare]]. It was clear that many of these men wanted to serve together in a special Bristol battalion, similar to other '[[Pals battalion]]s' being formed around the country. The [[War Office]] (WO) gave the committee authority to form the '''Bristol Battalion''', [[Gloucestershire Regiment]], on 30 August. Later in the year it became part of Kitchener's Fifth New Army (K5) and was officially numbered as the '''12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (Bristol)''', but the subtitle was usually rendered as 'Bristol's Own'. The recruiting committee encouraged 'mercantile and professional' men to apply, both through reasons of social exclusiveness and with a view to Kitchener's directive that workers in vital industries could not be spared. The first commanding officer (CO) was William Burges, who had retired from command of the 3rd Militia Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment some years before. Several of the other officers appointed had experience in the Regular or Auxiliary forces, and a number of junior officers had been members of their school or university [[Officer Training Corps]].<ref>Marks, pp. 8\u201320, 32\u20133, 39.</ref><ref name = Grist54>Grist, pp. 54\u20135.</ref><ref name = Daniell227>Daniell, p. 227.</ref><ref>Army Council Instructions, October 1914, Appendix VIII; December 1914, Appendix III.</ref><ref name = Frederick>Frederick, p. 102.</ref><ref name = James>James, p. 72.</ref><ref name = TrailGlos>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/gloucestershire-regiment/ Glosters at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = GlosCO>[http://www.ww1infantrycos.co.uk/gloucs.html Glosters at Infantry Battalion COs.]</ref>\n\n==Training==\nThe rush of recruits had overwhelmed the Army's ability to absorb them, so the Pals Battalions of K5 were left for some time in the hands of the recruiting committees. Initially the Bristol men lived at home and drilled by squads at Colston Hall in their civilian clothes, distinguished only by a lapel badge bearing the words 'New Bristol Battalion Gloucestershire Regt'. They then began battalion drills at the Artillery Grounds in [[Whiteladies Road]], the headquarters of the [[Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery|I South Midland (Gloucestershire) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery]] of the [[Territorial Force]]. But in late September the recruiting committee persuaded the WO to buy up the site of the abandoned Bristol International Exhibition in Greville Smyth Park, the buildings of which were converted into barracks by the [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Army Service Corps]]. The 'Weston Comrades' joined the rest of the battalion here in November and were posted to D Company. Some of the battalion's best men were already being posted away, for officer training for example, and on 30 November the WO authorised the recruiting committee to raise a fifth, reserve company (E Company); F Company was raised as a further reserve in April 1915. Old rifles had been issued to the battalion for drill purposes, with just a few modern [[Lee-Enfield|Lee-Enfield]] .303 SMLE rifles for musketry training. Uniforms were finally received in December 1914. In March 1915 the battalion began field training by companies at [[Chipping Sodbury]].<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 22\u201331, 40\u201351, 69, 71.</ref><ref>[http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Gloucestershire/TownBristol.htm Bristol at Drill Hall Project.]</ref>\n\nThe locally-raised units to form K5 were assigned to brigades on 10 December 1914: the Bristol Battalion was brigaded with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd [[Birmingham Pals]] (later 14th, 15th and 16th (Service) Battalions, [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]). The brigade was\ninitially numbered 116th Brigade in 39th Division, but in April 1915 the WO decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units to train reinforcements for the K1\u2013K3 units, and on 27 April the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the designations of the K4 formations. The short-lived 39th Division thus became [[32nd Division (United Kingdom)|32nd Division]] and 116th Brigade became [[95th Brigade (United Kingdom)|95th Brigade]].<ref name = TrailGlos/><ref>Army Council Instruction No 101 (10 December 1914).</ref><ref>Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix I2</ref><ref name = Becke32>Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 21\u201328.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 64.</ref>\n\nIn May 1915 the brigade was to have gathered in [[Shropshire]], but the ground selected at [[Prees Heath Army Camp|Prees Heath]] proved unsuitable for brigade training and on 23 June the 12th Gloucesters left Bristol to join 95th Brigade at [[Wensley, North Yorkshire]]. The two reserve or depot companies joined those of the Birmingham Pals at [[Sutton Coldfield]] to continue training. Brigade training started in earnest at Wensley, and 12th Gloucesters was finally adopted by the WO on 23 June 1915. Previously, most of the shooting had been on miniature ranges with .22 ammunition; now the men began weekly musketry courses (12th Gloucesters at [[Whitburn, Tyne and Wear|Whitburn]]) although many of the rifles were worn and defective. In August 32nd Division gathered on [[Salisbury Plain]] to begin final battle training, with 12th Gloucesters in camp at [[Codford]].<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Marks, pp. 79\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe battalion's strength at this time was about 1550, or more than 50 per cent over establishment; during August a large number of skilled men were transferred to other arms, others went to officer cadet training units, and older or unfit men were sent to the 15th (Reserve) Battalion at Sutton Coldfield into which the depot companies had been absorbed. Now that the battalion was almost ready to go overseas, the 59-year-old Lt-Col Burges was ordered to remain in the UK. He was succeeded in command by Lt-Col [[Martin Archer-Shee]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], a former Regular Army officer who was now [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Finsbury Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury Central]].<ref name = James/><ref name = Grist54/><ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Marks, pp. 89\u201390, 95.</ref>\n\n==Service==\nOn 11 November 1915 32nd Division was ordered to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and 12th Gloucesters landed at [[Boulogne]] on 21 November. By 28 November the division had concentrated round [[Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher]], north of the [[Somme (river)|River Somme]]. For its initiation into trench warfare with experienced units of [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]], 12th Gloucesters moved into a section of trenches thick with mud at [[Maricourt, Somme|Maricourt]] on 6 December. A Company was with 1st Bn [[East Surrey Regiment]] for instruction, and B Company with 2nd Bn [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. 95th Brigade was exchanged with a brigade from 5th Division on 26 December as part of a policy to even-up experience levels between formations. The Pals battalions were scattered among 5th Division's brigades; although 12th Gloucesters remained with 95th Brigade, it was now brigaded with three Regular Army battalions that had been fighting since the beginning of the war.<ref name = Grist54/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke32/><ref>Grist, pp. 97\u20138.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 95\u2013106.</ref><ref name = Becke5>Becke, Part 1, pp, 65\u201371.</ref>\n[[File:Daily_Mail_Postcard_-The_High_Street_of_Guillemont.jpg|thumb|right|The high street of Guillemont, captured on 3 September.]]\n===Somme===\n5th Division moved to the [[Arras]] sector in mid-February 1916, and 12th Gloucesters took over dry, well-made trenches with deep dug-outs, and lived in cellars in Arras when out of the line.<ref>Grist, p. 100.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 111\u20135.</ref> Steel helmets began to be issued to British troops early in 1916, but there were great shortages: Lt-Col Archer-Shee used his position as an MP and own observations in the trenches to ask embarrassing questions of the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]].<ref name = Daniell227/>\n\nThe battalion's first real taste of offensive warfare came during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The offensive had begun on 1 July, and 5th Division took over part of the line in the Delville Wood sector near [[Longueval]] between 18 and 20 July, where 95th Brigade was to deal with German strongpoints in the orchards. When the commander of 95th Brigade, [[Brigadier_(United_Kingdom)#Historical_rank_of_brigadier_general|Brigadier-General]] C.R. Ballard, was wounded on 20 July, Lt-Col Archer-Shee took temporary command until Brig-Gen Lord Esme Gordon-Lennox arrived to take over.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Marks, pp. 118\u20139.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 106\u20137, 141.</ref> From 23 to 26 July the battalion was in the front line and was heavily shelled, with [[High explosive shell|high explosive]], [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas]], suffering many casualties. It went back into Longueval on 28 July, when the line was advanced to 'Duke Street' without opposition, but shelling was heavier than ever. At 15.30 next day 95th Brigade attacked to complete the capture of Longueval in support of the main attack (the [[Battle of Delville Wood]]). 12th Gloucesters put in two companies on the left of the brigade after a half-hour bombardment, and they successfully advanced the line some {{convert|500|yd|m}} beyond Duke Street. The battalion held these positions until relieved next day.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 140\u20131.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 119\u201327.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, p. 160.</ref>\n[[File:Glosters_at_Guillemont.png|thumb|right|12th Bn Gloucesters' attack at Guillemont, 3 September 1916.]]\nThe phase of the offensive that began on 22 July culminated in the [[Battle of Guillemont]]. The village of [[Guillemont]] had withstood repeated British attacks, but 5th Division made a new attempt on 3 September. The bombardment began at 08.30 and the attack began at 12.00, with the men advancing behind a [[Creeping barrage]] (a recent innovation) moving at {{convert|50|yd|m}} a minute; the men were instructed to keep within {{convert|25|yd|m}} of the bursting shells. However, a flanking position at Falfemont Farm, which should have been captured in the morning, was still in enemy hands and threatened 95th Brigade's advance. The two leading companies of 12th Gloucesters took their first objective, a sunken lane, and found the [[Dugout_(shelter)#World_War_I|dugouts]] beyond to be unoccupied. But then they came under [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire from a machine gun off to the right in the Falfemont direction, which caused numerous casualties before A Company eliminated it. At 12.50 the battalion moved on to its second objective, the German line between Wedge Wood and the south of Guillemont village, which was taken without too much trouble. It then moved on at 14.50 to the third objective, a sunken lane running north from Wedge Wood towards [[Ginchy]]. Amidst the devastation of the battlefield C Company mistook Leuze Wood for Wedge Wood, got too far ahead and were caught by their own artillery fire. Although no enemy could be seen at Leuze Wood, the battalion was ordered to halt and consolidate its position rather than push into an awkward [[Salient (military)|salient]].<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151>Grist, pp. 151\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 132\u201340.</ref><ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 252\u20134; Sketch 32.</ref>\n[[File:The_Battle_of_the_Somme,_July-november_1916_Q4287.jpg|thumb|left|12th Gloucesters moving up in support near Ginchy, 25 September 1916.]]\nThe 12th Gloucesters was now only 300 strong and took no active part in the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette|Flers-Courcelette]] (18\u201322 September) though the battalion was later awarded it as a [[Battle honour]]. Although the battalion had been told that it would not have to go back into the line, it received a draft of 116 reinforcements and was given a role in 95th Brigade's next attack, the [[Battle of Morval]] on 25 September. The battalion was in support while 1st Bn [[Devonshire Regiment]] and 1st Bn East Surreys suffered heavy casualties taking the first and second objectives. 12th Gloucesters and 2nd [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] then moved through the village of Morval itself and dug in on the far side. The battalion's casualties were 12 killed and 61 wounded. The next night the battalion was relieved and went into camp in Happy Valley.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist151/><ref>Marks, pp. 146\u20138.</ref>\n<ref>Miles, ''1916'', Vol II, pp. 373\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lt-Col Archer-Shee, of the 950 members of 12th Gloucesters who entered the Battle of the Somme, 736 became casualties.<ref>Marks, p. 149.</ref> After the end of the Somme offensive the battalion continued to do duty in the appalling trenches in the area, alternating with tents in devastated [[Mametz, Somme|Mamez Wood]]. 5th Division moved to the [[B\u00e9thune]] sector in October and spent the next six months in this quieter area. On 22 October Lt-Col Archer-Shee returned to the UK for treatment to an old wound and was succeeded on 20 November by Lt-Col Robert Rawson, a Regular officer of the Gloucesters who had commanded 6th [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] for two years. Rawson also acted as 95th Brigade's commander during the winter. Archer-Shee returned to the battalion in January 1917, but resigned his command on 10 February 1917 to devote himself to his parliamentary duties. Rawson returned from Brigade HQ on 18 March and took over full command.<ref>Grist, pp. 182\u20137.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 150\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Arras===\n12th Gloucesters was in reserve to the [[Canadian Corps]] for the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] on 9 April. Then on the night of 4/5 May, as the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] continued, 95th Brigade relieved a Canadian Brigade that had captured [[Fresnoy-en-Gohelle|Fresnoy]]. Because of casualties, 12th Gloucesters was reduced to three companies, so it had two companies of 1st [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] (DCLI) under its command in order to hold the wood north of the town. During 7 May the British trenches were heavily bombarded, then that night two successive attacks came in. 12th Gloucesters repulsed the first at 03.45 (which may have been an unplanned clash as the German storm troops moved into position) but the battalion was overwhelmed by the second attack at 05.45, which completely broke through the British lines and recaptured Fresnoy. Rawson sent up D Company DCLI and his own C Company to try to restore the situation, followed later by D Company 12th Gloucesters, but all they could do was hold a sunken lane behind the lost positions until relieved at 10.00. The battalion lost 389 casualties, including 94 dead; A and B Companies had completely disappeared, killed or captured, and there were no officers left in the frontline companies.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Falls, ''1917'', Vol I, pp. 520\u20131.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 188\u201393.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 157\u201365.</ref>\n\n===Ypres===\n[[File:Hill-62-Museum-Tranches-Ypres-Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved trenches at [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62]]: when 12th Gloucesters were stationed here it was 'an unimaginably foul and miserable place'. There were no trees left and the battalion was sheltering in shell craters and dugouts.<ref>Grist, p. 213.</ref>]]\nThe battered battalions were slowly built up to strength and trained hard, but 12th Gloucesters did not see major action again until the latter stages of the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Ypres Offensive]]. 5th Division moved into [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps']] area on the night of 2/3 October during the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]], then attacked on 4 October (the [[Battle of Broodseinde]]). Launched at 06.00, 95th Brigade advanced {{convert|500|yd|m}} with the help of a tank to deal with German [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]]. 12th Gloucesters had been in reserve to the attacking battalion, 1st [[East Surrey Regiment]], and moved three companies up into the Surreys' forming-up trenches 40 minutes after Zero hour, where they suffered badly from the German counter-barrage. Later in the morning C Company was sent up to help 1st [[Devonshire Regiment]]. The following day the battalion held the captured line, under continuing artillery fire. In preparation for the next attack (the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]] on 9 October), 12th Gloucesters was in [[Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62|Sanctuary Wood]], where it was under observation and artillery fire from the enemy and movement was restricted to duckboard tracks. On 8 October the battalion was split, with two companies providing carrying parties and the other two in the support line behind 1st Bn [[Cheshire Regiment]]. When the attack was delivered, the companies in Sanctuary Wood provided carrying and burial parties, while the two in the support line were pinned by artillery and could not be relieved until 10/11 October. Despite not actually attacking itself, 12th Gloucesters lost 359 casualties (150 from gas), of whom 88 died, in the period 1\u201312 October.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 314, 334.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 210\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 167\u201370.</ref>\n\nWhile 5th Division continued to attack (the Second Battle of Passchendaele), 12th Gloucesters remained out of the line after Poelcapelle, resting, absorbing a few reinforcements, and training. It spent two short spells holding the line, suffering only light casualties, and then the whole division was pulled out. At the end of October Lt-Col Rawson left the battalion for a six-month tour of duty in the UK and the second-in-command, Maj H.A. Colt, was promoted to succeed him.<ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 214.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 170\u20131.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nFollowing the Austro-German breakthrough at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], the BEF was required to release divisions to reinforce the [[Italian Army]]. On 23 November, 5th Division was warned that it would be moved to the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Entrainment began at [[Hesdin]] on 27 November, but after A and C Companies were got away, B and D were held back under orders to move at a moment's notice to the [[Cambrai]] sector, where the German counter-attack following the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] threatened to break through. The fighting died down after 3 December, and the two companies were released. 5th Division completed its concentration to the east of the [[Brenta (river)|River Brenta]], not far from [[Padua]], by 20 December. When 5th Division took over part of the line along the [[Piave (river)|River Piave]] on 27 January 1918 12th Gloucesters relieved an Italian unit, and was ordered to wear Italian helmets to conceal the fact that British troops had taken over. The battalion carried out several fighting patrols against the opposing Hungarian units until 5th Division was relieved on 18 March.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds, ''1917'', Vol II, pp. 352, 391.</ref><ref>Grist, pp. 222\u20133.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 174\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Spring Offensive===\nThe Germans began their [[Spring Offensive]] on the Western Front on 21 March and achieved rapid successes. On 24 March 5th Division was warned that it would return to France. Entrainment began on 1 April, 12th Gloucesters started on 2 April, and the division completed its concentration between [[Doullens]] and [[Fr\u00e9vent]] on 9 April.<ref name = James/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, pp. 224, 267.</ref><ref>Marks, p. 181.</ref>\n[[File:British_Lewis_gun_team_Battle_of_Hazebrouck_1918_IWM_Q_10902.jpg|thumb|right|A British Lewis gun team at the Battle of Hazebrouck]]\nThe second phase of the Spring Offensive (Operation Georgette, or the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)|Battle of the Lys]]) had opened on 7 April and 5th Division took up positions from the Lys Canal to the [[Nieppe|Forest of Nieppe]], where it came under immediate attack (the [[Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)#Battle_of_Hazebrouck_(12\u201315_April)|Battle of Hazebrouck]]). On 13 April 12th Gloucesters held off one German attack for the loss of 76 casualties, including 18 killed. By 15 April the battalion was well dug in and held off another attack. The battalion was out of the line from 16 to 21 April, and then carried out an attack of its own on 22 April. Close behind a creeping barrage it captured Le Vert Bois Farm (later renamed 'Gloucester Farm') without serious opposition, but it took all day to take Le Vert Bois itself. The battalion captured three German machine guns and 39 prisoners. The Germans abandoned Operation Georgette a few days later. <ref name = Becke5/><ref>Grist, p. 267.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 182\u20135.</ref>\n\nOn 28 June the British launched a limited operation to improve their positions along the edge of the Nieppe Forest. 12th Gloucesters was tasked with capturing Le Cornet Perdu, moving up in darkness to attack at 06.00. It took all its objectives by 09.30, and pushed patrols up to the PLate Becq river, though a handful of German machine guns had caused 164 casualties, of whom 45 died.<ref name = Becke5/> <ref>Grist, p. 270.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 186\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Hundred Days Offensive===\nThe [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] launched their own [[Hundred Days Offensive]] on 8 August 1918, when 5th Division was in reserve. It then came into action at the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Third Battle of Albert]] on 21 August. This was a three-phase attack, with 5th Division passing through [[37th Division (United Kingdom)|37th Division ]] for the second phase. 95th Brigade led, with 12th Gloucesters as its reserve. Once the second objective had been taken, 12th Gloucesters took over and despite having lost the barrage advanced over a mile of open country with some of 1st East Surreys and just reached the Arras\u2013[[Albert, Somme|Albert]] railway before meeting stronger opposition. Mist now hampered the artillery and tanks and the battalion was unable to push beyond the railway to the final objective. It had lost an officer and 11 other ranks killed, and nearly100 wounded. Next day the battalion consolidated, then drove off a German counter-attack at 17.30, capturing 180 prisoners and five machine guns in the process. On 23 August, reinforced by two companies of 1st DCLI, the battalion launched an attack at 11.00 behind a creeping barrage to capture the railway line itself. The Germans had numerous machine gun nests along it and caused numerous casualties before they were overrun. Having lost the barrage, the battalion was unable to advance beyond the ridge to [[Irles]], and requested reinforcements. Before they arrived, the neighbouring brigade attacked, so Lt-Col Colt led a charge by the remainder of 12th Gloucesters and the DCLI companies to capture the village, though losses were heavy: 30 men were killed and nine officers and 170 men wounded, including Lt-Col Colt (who was awarded the DSO). The previous CO, Lt-Col Rawson, returned to command the battalion.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = GlosCO/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, pp. 191, 229\u201330.</ref><ref name = Grist275>Grist, p. 275.</ref><ref>Marks, pp. 189\u201393.</ref> \n\nThe weakened battalion was withdrawn into reserve while the rest of 95th Brigade attacked on 30 August (the [[Battle of the Scarpe (1918)|Battle of the Scarpe]]) and then took over holding part of the front line. 95th Brigade was relieved on 4 September after the conclusion of the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]]. Part of 5th Division went into action at the [[Battle of \u00c9pehy]] on 18 September, and  12th Gloucesters later received the battle honour despite not being engaged.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist275/><ref>Edmonds, ''1918'', Vol IV, p. 363, 493.</ref><ref name = Grist279>Grist, p, 279.</ref>\n\nAll the Allied armies began a rolling offensive all the way along the Western Front on 26 September. The BEF's [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] stormed across the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord|Canal du Nord]] on 27 September, and next morning 5th Division launched a follow-up attack. Because the designated assault brigade ([[13th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|13th Brigade]]) had suffered heavy casualties, 95th Brigade was substituted for it at short notice and only just got to the jumping-off position in time for Zero hour at 02.40. It ran into considerable opposition and 12th Gloucesters found both its flanks were open; 1st DCLI came up on the left later, but the right remained  exposed and isolated German machine gun posts had to be dealt with using [[Rifle grenade|rifle grenades]]. It was not until 08.00 that the first village was taken. The brigade then had to resort to trench warfare methods to work its way up to the second objective on the slopes of Welsh Ridge by evening. 95th Brigade was also hung up when it attacked again next day, finding the pace of the creeping barrage too fast over broken ground. By the time it was relieved on 30 September 12th Gloucesters' casualties amounted to 52, 24 of them fatal, though it had taken about 120 prisoners.<ref name = Becke5/><ref name = Grist279/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, pp. 48, 118.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nWhile 5th Division had been in Italy, the BEF's manpower shortage led to infantry brigades being reduced from four to three battalions. 5th Division's brigades had retained the four-battalion establishment, but by late 1918 the shortage of manpower was critical, and the division had to fall in line. As the only New Army battalion in 95th Brigade, 12th Gloucesters was ordered to disband and the remaining men were drafted to other units. 12th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, (Bristol's Own) commenced disbandment on 19 October 1918 while the [[Battle of the Selle]] was raging. Most of D Company was posted to 14th Warwicks, which became the divisional pioneer battalion. Others went to 1st Devons and 1st DCLI. The war ended less than a month later when the [[Armistice with Germany]] came into effect.<ref name = Frederick/><ref name = James/><ref name = TrailGlos/><ref name = Becke5/><ref>Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, ''1918'', Vol V, p. 338.</ref><ref name = Marks194>Marks, p. 194.</ref>\n\nDuring its service the battalion had suffered losses of 32 officers and 754 other ranks killed. Of the original 990 men who landed in France in November 1915, 205 had died with the battalion, and over 100 more after being posted to other units.<ref name = Daniell227/><ref name = Marks194/><ref name = DaniellApp>Daniell, Appendix I.</ref>\n\n==15th (Reserve) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment==\n15th (Reserve) Battalion was formed at Sutton Coldfield on 31 August 1915 from the depot companies of the 12th (Bristol's Own) and 14th (West of England) Battalions of the Gloucesters. The 14th (Service) Battalion was a '[[Bantam (military)|Bantam]]' battalion that had been raised by the Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee on 22 April 1915. It moved to [[Chiseldon|Chiseldon Camp]] and joined [[22nd Reserve Brigade]]. The CO from 10 August 1915 to 31 August 1916 was Lt-Col Stephen Willcock. On 1 September 1916 it became 93rd Training Reserve Battalion in 22nd Reserve Bde and on 4 July 1917 it was redesignated 262nd (Infantry) Battalion of the Training Reserve.

The One-Twenty model designation was replaced by the [[Packard 200]].\n\nThe One-Twenty signified the first time that Packard had entered into the highly competitive mid-priced eight-cylinder car market. Packard enthusiasts view the production of the One-Twenty and the [[Packard One-Ten|Six/One-Ten models]] as the start of Packard's losing its hold on the market as the premier American luxury automotive brand. It was a marketing strategy shared with GM's [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]], the [[Chrysler Airstream]], and the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]]. It was introduced after Rolls-Royce brought to market the [[Rolls-Royce Twenty|Rolls-Royce 20]], which was manufactured between 1922 and 1929, and replaced by the [[Rolls-Royce 20/25]] which was built between 1929\u20131936.\n\nThe introduction of the One-Twenty (and later the Six/One-Ten models) was a necessary move to keep Packard in business during the final years of the [[Great Depression]], expanding on an earlier approach with the [[Packard Light Eight]]. Branding the One-Twenty a Packard afforded buyers the cachet of owning a Packard, a name long regarded{{By whom|date=April 2016}} as one of America's most prestigious cars. Other reasons the company decided to forgo the development of a companion brand name to sell the less expensive models may have been linked to its single production line capability at its Grand Boulevard manufacturing plant or to the expense of launching a new brand of automobile. It also ushered in a novel advertising approach, commissioning an advertising \"jingle\" called \"[[When Heaven Was at the Corner of Sycamore and Main]]\".\n\n== The ''Safe-T-Flex'' suspension ==\nThis car introduced the [[independent front suspension]] to the Packard line. Its so-called \"Safe-T-Flex\" suspension was an [[Double wishbone suspension|unequal upper and lower A-arm type]] with the largest possible lower A-arm composed of two different arms bolted together at a ninety-degree angle.<ref name=\"1936 Packard 120 Owner's Manual\">{{cite web|title=1936 Packard 120 Owner's Manual|url=http://packardinfo.com/xoops/html/modules/article/view.article.php?224|website=packardinfo.com|accessdate=22 August 2015|pages=37\u201339|format=pdf|date=December 1935}}</ref>\n\nThe support arm was a heavy steel [[forging]] reaching a few degrees forward of lateral from the front wheel support to as close to the centerline of the car as is practicable. An integral pad socketed the helical spring, whose upper end reached a high frame cross-beam. A tubular, hence lighter, steel torque arm was bolted to the support arm somewhat inboard of the wheel to permit a sufficient steering arc. It reached the frame nearly at the dashboard with a spherical rubber bearing. The upper A-arm was conventionally welded and oriented parallel to the lower one. Between it and the frame was an old-fashioned horizontal [[shock absorber]] whose two cylinders were side by side.<ref name=\"1936 Packard 120 Owner's Manual\" />\n\nThe support arm carried all the load; the torque arm carried the accelerating and decelerating torque; the upper A-arm controlled the [[Camber angle|camber]]. Advantages claimed for the system included superior maintenance of [[wheel alignment]] from the wide spread of the lower A-arm, a permanent fixing of the [[caster angle]], and an increased percentage of the braking force transmitted to the frame through the torque arm.<ref name=\"1936 Packard 120 Owner's Manual\" />\n\n== First generation (1935\u20131937) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name              = First generation\n| image             = Packard One Twenty 4-Door Sedan 193X.jpg\n| caption           = 1937 Packard One-Twenty Touring Sedan\n| model_years   = 1935\u20131937\n| body_style      = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[coup\u00e9]]|2-door [[convertible]]|2-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] (1935 only)|4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]}}\n| layout             = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| related            = [[Packard Eight]]\n| engine            = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|257|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-eight engine|I8]] (1935)|{{convert|282|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-eight engine|I8]] (1936\u201337)}}\n| transmission  = 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase     = {{convert|120|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|title=1935 Packard 120 Series|url=http://classiccardatabase.com/specs.php?series=654&year=1935&model=18124|website=Classic Car Database|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n| length            = \n| width              = \n| height            = \n| weight            = \n}}\n\nIn its introduction year, the Packard One-Twenty was available in a broad array of body styles including two and four-door sedans, convertible and Club Coupe.

It was a marketing strategy shared with GM's [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]], the [[Chrysler Airstream]], and the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]]. It was introduced after Rolls-Royce brought to market the [[Rolls-Royce Twenty|Rolls-Royce 20]], which was manufactured between 1922 and 1929, and replaced by the [[Rolls-Royce 20/25]] which was built between 1929-1936.\n\nThe introduction of the One-Twenty (and later the Six/One-Ten models) was a necessary move to keep Packard in business during the final years of the [[Great Depression]], expanding on an earlier approach with the [[Packard Light Eight]]. Branding the One-Twenty a Packard afforded buyers the cachet of owning a Packard, a name long regarded{{By whom|date=April 2016}} as one of America's most prestigious cars. Other reasons the company decided to forgo the development of a companion brand name to sell the less expensive models may have been linked to its single production line capability at its Grand Boulevard manufacturing plant or to the expense of launching a new brand of automobile. It also ushered in a novel advertising approach, commissioning an advertising \"jingle\" called \"[[When Heaven Was at the Corner of Sycamore and Main]]\".\n\n== The ''Safe-T-Flex'' suspension ==\nThis car introduced the [[independent front suspension]] to the Packard line. Its so-called \"Safe-T-Flex\" suspension was an [[Double wishbone suspension|unequal upper and lower A-arm type]] with the largest possible lower A-arm composed of two different arms bolted together at a ninety-degree angle.<ref name=\"1936 Packard 120 Owner's Manual\">{{cite web|title=1936 Packard 120 Owner's Manual|url=http://packardinfo.com/xoops/html/modules/article/view.article.php?224|website=packardinfo.com|accessdate=22 August 2015|pages=37\u201339|format=pdf|date=December 1935}}</ref>\n\nThe support arm was a heavy steel [[forging]] reaching a few degrees forward of lateral from the front wheel support to as close to the centerline of the car as is practicable. An integral pad socketed the helical spring, whose upper end reached a high frame cross-beam. A tubular, hence lighter, steel torque arm was bolted to the support arm somewhat inboard of the wheel to permit a sufficient steering arc. It reached the frame nearly at the dashboard with a spherical rubber bearing. The upper A-arm was conventionally welded and oriented parallel to the lower one. Between it and the frame was an old-fashioned horizontal [[shock absorber]] whose two cylinders were side by side.<ref name=\"1936 Packard 120 Owner's Manual\" />\n\nThe support arm carried all the load; the torque arm carried the accelerating and decelerating torque; the upper A-arm controlled the [[Camber angle|camber]]. Advantages claimed for the system included superior maintenance of [[wheel alignment]] from the wide spread of the lower A-arm, a permanent fixing of the [[caster angle]], and an increased percentage of the braking force transmitted to the frame through the torque arm.<ref name=\"1936 Packard 120 Owner's Manual\" />\n\n== First generation (1935\u20131937) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name              = First generation\n| image             = Packard One Twenty 4-Door Sedan 193X.jpg\n| caption           = 1937 Packard One-Twenty Touring Sedan\n| model_years   = 1935\u20131937\n| body_style      = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[coup\u00e9]]|2-door [[convertible]]|2-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] (1935 only)|4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]}}\n| layout             = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| related            = [[Packard Eight]]\n| engine            = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|257|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-eight engine|I8]] (1935)|{{convert|282|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-eight engine|I8]] (1936\u201337)}}\n| transmission  = 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase     = {{convert|120|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|title=1935 Packard 120 Series|url=http://classiccardatabase.com/specs.php?series=654&year=1935&model=18124|website=Classic Car Database|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n| length            = \n| width              = \n| height            = \n| weight            = \n}}\n\nIn its introduction year, the Packard One-Twenty was available in a broad array of body styles including two and four-door sedans, convertible and Club Coupe.

{{convert|22.5|km|mi}}. Growth in the east is restricted due to the presence of [[Kuakhai River]] and by the wildlife sanctuary in the northwestern part.<ref name=citystructure/> The city can be broadly divided into the old town, planned city (or state capital), added areas and outer peripheral areas. It is subdivided into Units and Colonies.\n\nThe old town or \"Temple Town\", the oldest part of the city, is characterised by many temples, including the [[Lingaraja temple|Lingaraja]], [[Rajarani Temple|Rajarani]], and [[Muktesvara deula|Muktesvara temples]], standing alongside residential areas. This area is congested, with narrow roads and poor infrastructure.<ref name=citystructure/> Among neighbourhoods in the old town are Rajarani Colony, Pandaba Nagar, Brahmeswara Bagh, Lingaraja Nagar, Gouri Nagar, Bhimatangi and Kapileswara.\nThe planned city was designed in 1948 to house the capital. It is subdivided into units, each with a high school, shopping centres, dispensaries and play areas. While most of the units house government employees, Unit V houses the administrative buildings, including the State Secretariat, State Assembly, and the Raj Bhavan. Private residential areas were later built in other areas of the planned city, including [[Saheed Nagar]] and Satya Nagar. Unit I, popularly known as the Market Building, was formed to cater to the shopping needs of the new capital's residents. Later, markets and commercial establishments developed along the [[Janpath, Bhubaneswar|Janpath]] and [[Cuttack-Puri Road]] at [[Saheed Nagar]], Satya Nagar, Bapuji Nagar and Ashok Nagar. A dedicated institutional area houses educational and research institutes, including [[Utkal University]], the [[Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar|Institute of Physics]], the [[Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology]] and Sainik School. Indira Gandhi Park, Gandhi Park and the Biju Patnaik Park are located in the unit.<ref name=citystructure/>\n\nThe added areas are mostly areas lying north of National Highway 5, including Nayapalli, Jayadev Vihar, [[Chandrasekharpur]] and [[Chandrasekharpur#Sailashree Vihar|Sailashree Vihar]], [[#Niladri vihar]] which were developed by Bhubaneswar Development Authority to house the growing population.<ref name=citystructure/> With the development of the new areas such as Chandrasekharpur the city is now divided roughly into North(newer areas) and South Bhubaneswar (older areas) by the NH-5 highway.\n\nThe peripheral areas are outside the municipal boundary or have subsequently been included within the extended boundary, including Tomando, Patia and Raghunathpur. Most of these areas were developed in a haphazard manner, without proper planning.<ref>{{cite news|last=Praharaj|first=Maharani|title=Urban sprawl: Its impact on peri-urban areas of Bhubaneswar|url=http://dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/98402-urban-sprawl-its-impact-on-peri-urban-areas-of-bhubaneswar.html|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=The Pioneer|date=30 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703212324/http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/98402-urban-sprawl-its-impact-on-peri-urban-areas-of-bhubaneswar.html|archive-date=3 July 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{{wide image|Deras Dam.jpg|1000px|align-cap=left|[[Deras Dam]] }}\n\nBhubaneswar secured the top rank in the [[Smart city]] list in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Bhubaneswar-ranked-countrys-smartest-city/articleshow/50766312.cms|title=Bhubaneswar ranked country's smartest city|work=The Times of India|access-date=11 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206163635/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Bhubaneswar-ranked-countrys-smartest-city/articleshow/50766312.cms|archive-date=6 February 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Meteorological Centre, Bhubaneswar, Odisha.JPG|thumb|Meteorological Centre, Bhubaneswar|alt=A one storied building with decorative plants and landscaping around it]]\nBhubaneswar has a [[tropical savanna climate]], designated ''Aw'' under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].

This area is congested, with narrow roads and poor infrastructure.<ref name=citystructure/> Among neighbourhoods in the old town are Rajarani Colony, Pandaba Nagar, Brahmeswara Bagh, Lingaraja Nagar, Gouri Nagar, Bhimatangi and Kapileswara.\nThe planned city was designed in 1948 to house the capital. It is subdivided into units, each with a high school, shopping centres, dispensaries and play areas. While most of the units house government employees, Unit V houses the administrative buildings, including the State Secretariat, State Assembly, and the Raj Bhavan. Private residential areas were later built in other areas of the planned city, including [[Saheed Nagar]] and Satya Nagar. Unit I, popularly known as the Market Building, was formed to cater to the shopping needs of the new capital's residents. Later, markets and commercial establishments developed along the [[Janpath, Bhubaneswar|Janpath]] and [[Cuttack-Puri Road]] at [[Saheed Nagar]], Satya Nagar, Bapuji Nagar and Ashok Nagar. A dedicated institutional area houses educational and research institutes, including [[Utkal University]], the [[Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar|Institute of Physics]], the [[Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology]] and Sainik School. Indira Gandhi Park, Gandhi Park and the Biju Patnaik Park are located in the unit.<ref name=citystructure/>\n\nThe added areas are mostly areas lying north of National Highway 5, including Nayapalli, Jayadev Vihar, [[Chandrasekharpur]] and [[Chandrasekharpur#Sailashree Vihar|Sailashree Vihar]], [[#Niladri vihar]] which were developed by Bhubaneswar Development Authority to house the growing population.<ref name=citystructure/> With the development of the new areas such as Chandrasekharpur the city is now divided roughly into North(newer areas) and South Bhubaneswar (older areas) by the NH-5 highway.\n\nThe peripheral areas are outside the municipal boundary or have subsequently been included within the extended boundary, including Tomando, Patia and Raghunathpur.

In [[England]], [[Swarthmoor Hall]] near the town of [[Ulverston, England|Ulverston]], [[Cumbria]], (previously in [[Lancashire]]) was the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell in 1652 when [[George Fox]], (1624\u20131691), fresh from his epiphany atop [[Pendle Hill]] in 1651, came to visit. The visitation turned into a long association, as Fox persuaded Thomas and Margaret Fell of his views. Swarthmoor was used for the first meetings of what became known as the Religious Society of Friends (later colloquially labeled \"The Quakers\").\n\nThe College was founded in 1864 by a committee of members of the [[Quakers#Hicksite-Orthodox split|Hicksite]] [[Yearly Meetings]] of [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Baltimore]] and is the only college founded by the Hicksite branch of the Society of Friends: previous Quaker institutions, like the nearby [[Haverford College]], were Orthodox.

Besides the focus on Quaker history, the holdings are a significant research collection for the regional and local history of the middle-Atlantic region of the United States and the history of American social reform. Quakers played prominent roles in almost every major reform movement in American history, including abolition, African-American history, Indian rights, women's rights, prison reform, humane treatment of the mentally ill, and temperance. The collections also reflect the significant role Friends played in the development of science, technology, education, and business in Britain and America. The Library also maintains the Swarthmore College Archives and the papers of the Swarthmore Historical Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/friends-historical-library|title=Friends Historical Library :: Swarthmore College|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=April 27, 2017|date=July 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420182602/https://www.swarthmore.edu/friends-historical-library|archive-date=April 20, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://swarthmorehistoricalsociety.org/|title=Swarthmore Historical Society|website=Swarthmore Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=April 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429000317/http://swarthmorehistoricalsociety.org/|archive-date=April 29, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWithin the [[archive]]s is what was formerly known as the Jane Addams Peace Collection and later called the Swarthmore College Peace Collection (SCPC).<ref name=\":03\">{{cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/DG051-099/dg051brinton.htm|title=Ellen Starr Brinton Papers (DG 051)|last=|first=|date=June 22, 2016|website=Swarthmore College Peace Collection|access-date=August 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016220744/http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/DG051-099/dg051brinton.htm|archive-date=October 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The SCPC includes papers from [[Jane Addams]]' collection and material from over 59 countries.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13297203/|title=Library Possesses Rare Resources|last=Skidmore|first=Arden|date=April 25, 1964|work=Delaware County Daily Times|access-date=August 23, 2017|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> The [[Nobel Peace Prize]], awarded to Addams, is part of the collection.<ref name=\":7\" /> The SCPC states that \"Well over fifty percent of all the holdings in the Peace Collection concern women's activism around the world.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/Exhibits/Internationalwomen.html|title=Women's Voices From Around the World, Swarthmore College Peace Collection|publisher=Swarthmore College|access-date=May 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510030016/http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/Exhibits/Internationalwomen.html|archive-date=May 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The SCPC was started when a member of the board of managers discovered that Addams was burning her old papers, and convinced her to donate them instead to the Friends Historical Library.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13297441/|title=Archives Take in Peace Unit Papers|last=|first=|date=April 25, 1964|work=Delaware County Daily Times|access-date=August 23, 2017|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> After [[World War II]], the librarian at [[Princeton University]], [[Julian P.
