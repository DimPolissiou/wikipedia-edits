According to his brother Sserunjoji, the reason he did not go further may be due to lack of funds to facilitate his love and passion for music. His mother [[Namyalo]] narrates that Herman Basudde attended Kibanda and Butenga primary school. One of his classmates says that in Basudde's school years he was a quick learner, and had a passion for art and graphics which took most of his time. Basudde also joined a school choir which earned him credits due to his soft and Ilouder voice.\nThe legacy of Busudde in the field of music came a long way from his father. The late [[Mark Augustine Makumbi]], a former [[Bukedde]] TV and CBS Radio presenter while giving the background of [[Kadongokamu]] singers, talks about Basudde. He says that his father was an X-soldier from second world war veteran. He had a white friend called Brown, who loved him so much. When the mission was accomplished and was time to depart from one another, Brown gave him a guitar saying take this, I don't have money to give you, let it be a souvenir to remember me from\" on his return home, he kept the guitar because it was of no use to him.\nHe started to play a guitar at home without anyone teaching him.\nAs time went on, his mother tried to stop him from playing the guitar instead of doing household work or school homework; but his father insisted that he go ahead as he might prosper in a musical career. The guitar could hardly leave no space for books. This, in along with absolute poverty through which the family persisted, pushed him to drop out without completing his primary seven.\nWhenever there was a party in the village, he could escort his guitar paving a way to entertain the guests. In return as excitement paves, they gave him their appreciation and encouragement in terms of money.\nUnfortunately, others saw this upside down. The youth mostly laid a plan to throw him down since he was earning presents and gifts wherever he could go and entertain.\nAs his culture, one day he entertained Christian at their local Catholic parish. He sang a song he entitled \u201damajjiini ngetala luno\" (the rampant demons). The priest was overwhelmed where by he told him to play it again and again. At that function, Basudde earned a lot of money offered to him. This troubled his rivals so much. They planned a way of taking him off.\nIn the area, there was a rebel group called \u201c[[FEDEMU]]\u201d which had captured most of the southern part of Southern [[Uganda]]. Peace was now in their hands. Basudde's rival youth approached them informing that Basudde had a gun. Immediately, they sagged his father's house. They searched the whole place. They grabbed him and took him for interrogation. They tortured him unceasingly while asking for the whereabouts of the gun. After all that, he was brought back home nearly to death.\nHe was taken to [[Masaka]] referral Hospital where he was treated for many days. He was later returned home and given medicine there. As he gained energy, his father advised him to leave the village or else he would loss his life.\nIn the mid 1980s, he was picked by Eria Katende and brought to [[Kampala]].\n\n==Career==\nHis career guide was the singer [[Livingstone Kasozi]] who trained him how to play a guitar, sing and perform live on stage.<ref name=\"alinda\">{{cite web|last1=Alinda|first1=Alex|title=Walukagga Visits Kadongo Kamu Legend, Livingstone Kasozi\u2019s Grave|url=http://chimpreports.com/entertainment/walukagga-visits-kadongo-kamu-legend-livingstone-kasozis-grave/|website=chimpreports.com|publisher=Chimp Reports|accessdate=30 October 2016}}</ref> He toured East Africa countries, travelling to Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda.

In a popular song, ''Ekiwuka Ekyaga Muntamu'', Basudde used metaphor to invoke the [[AIDS]] epidemic in Uganda. In the song, the narrator dreams of a lizard-like insect invading his home and despoiling life, food and sex.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xP5qY8rO4UEC&pg=PA170&dq=%22Herman+Basudde%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjtjKmQg_zPAhWB6CYKHZ8oBDkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22Herman%20Basudde%22&f=false The Oxford Handbook of Medical Ethnomusicology, Oxford University Press, USA, April 27, 2011, p. 170]</ref>\n\nBasudde died in an accident while travelling to his parents' house in Masaka, south of Kampala. His funeral was a national occasion, and the funeral fund raised 12 million shillings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Some saw Basudde as a rebellious spirit. He had left the Catholic Church to adopt animism and was attacked by certain clergy for forsaking religion in favour of witchcraft. He was accused of sensationalising his music by bringing seductively dressed girls onto the stage and commercialising the Kadongo Kamu singers.\n\n==popularity==\n[[Basaaya]] [[Rocks Peter]] an historian says that Herman Basudde was a prophet since he could foretell what would happen before. His popularity is still rampant where by many upcoming artists visits his grave to seek wisdom.\n[[Fred Ssebatta]], one of Kadongokamu regents, asserts that Herman Basudde was creative and worked quickly. He continued by saying that it would be very difficult to compare Herman Basudde in writing music with anybody. He further said that whenever Herman Basudde could release a song, Ssebatta would target him on the second day.\nOn 12 October 2012, Gheto president [[Bobi wine]] paid a tribute to the great works of Herman Basudde. He narrates in time like this, 'how I wish prophet Herman Basudde could be around'... He left us to accomplish his mission but, his shoes are far big for us to wear' he said.\nBasude composed in his head and couldn't repeat what he has earlier sung.\nHerman Basudde toured East Africa countries, travelling to [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] finally to [[Rwanda]]. This tour raised him over 70 million shillings, a huge amount at that time. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Death and aftermath==\nBefore his death, Basudde had foretold his death through words and actions. Aisha Nakito (widow) narrated what happened days before his death. On 10 June 1997, he went to meet Jane Basirika (concubine) after several days while touring EA . They had a meal in await for Serunjoji. As soon as Serunjoji came, he embraced him. They had had some misunderstanding back ago, so they had a family union. After all, they set for [[masaka]].  His father had been paralyzed at home. On their way, they stopped at [[Lukaya, Uganda|Lukaya]] road toll for a snack. Here, Basudde got annoyed with a certain man and he was about to fight him. Sylivester Busuulwa settled the matter. He started the vehicle with a lot of anger and at a high speed. Reaching [[Kabaale]] [[Bugonzi]], a tragedy happened. As a lorry was overtaking, Basudde lost control and his vehicle overturned several times. \"W''hat a mess this man has caused me!\"'' He had his last breath. Hermann Basudde, a famous Ugandan singer and guitarist died in a tragic accident while travelling to his parents' house in Masaka, south of Kampala.\nBasudde had a huge following for his husky voice and the passion of his lyrics about mischievous love affairs, philandering husbands, bizarre witchcraft and other songs which propelled him from abject poverty to a fortune worth millions during his lifetime.\nHe had revolutionised the Kadongo Kamu (singers) who were known for their skillful guitar playing.\nBefore Basudde died he insisted that he be buried with his favourite \"dry guitar\", as he called it. He had noted that his long term colleague, [[Livingstone]] [[Kasozi]] had been buried holding his favourite cassette tape and he wanted his guitar to console him in the same way in the after life.\nBasudde's funeral was a national occasion.

Dryland farming is associated with [[drylands]], areas characterized by a cool [[wet season]] (every person charges the soil, with virtually all the moisture that the crops will receive prior to harvest) followed by a warm dry season.

Van Lerberghe attacked early in the race, which made him popular amongst cycling fans, but this cost him a lot of energy, and he rarely was able to compete in the end of the race.<ref name=\"rdh\"/>\n\nIn the 1913 Tour de France, Vanlerberghe started in the isolated cyclists' category, which meant that he was not part of a team, but rode as an individual.<ref name=\"mdc1913\">{{cite web|url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1913.php |publisher=Memoire du cyclisme |title=11\u00e8me Tour de France 1913 |language=French |accessdate=10 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5glvxmOFf?url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1913.php |archivedate=14 May 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In the fifth stage, the individual cyclists left fifteen minutes later than the cyclists in teams, but because the cyclists in teams were slow, Van Lerberghe was able to reach them, and beat them to win the stage.\n\nDuring the 1919 Ronde Van Vlaanderen, Vanlerberghe attacked with 120&nbsp;km to go against the wind, and it looked like one of his chanceless efforts. He saw a helper with a bag of food for [[Marcel Buysse]], and after he convinced the helper that Buysse was already out of the race, Vanlerberghe took the food. Later, he had to stop because a train had stopped at a crossing. Vanlerberghe did not wait for the train to leave, but entered the train with his bicycle and left at the other side. He reached the finish with a margin of 14 minutes, the largest margin in the history of the Tour of Flanders.<ref name=\"rdh\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nusport.nl/rob-de-haan/2216424/ik-zal-jullie-doodrijden.html|title=Ik zal jullie doodrijden!|language=Dutch|author=Haan, Rob de|publisher=Sanoma Uitgevers|work=nusport.nl|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Major results==\nSource:<ref>{{Cycling Archives|7779}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n;1913\n:[[1913 Tour de France]]:\n::Winner stage 5\n;1919\n:[[Tour of Flanders]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Tour de France results|1821|archive=20070808143635}}\n\n{{Tour of Flanders winners}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Van Lerberghe, Henri}}\n[[Category:Belgian male cyclists]]\n[[Category:1891 births]]\n[[Category:1966 deaths]]\n[[Category:Belgian Tour de France stage winners]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from West Flanders]]\n[[Category:Tour de France cyclists]]\n[[Category:People from Lichtervelde]]\n\n\n{{Belgium-cycling-bio-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Lepricavark", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:added short description", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Vanlerberghe"}
