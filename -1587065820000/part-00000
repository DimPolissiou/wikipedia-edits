More details \n|-\n| April 2011{{snd}}December 2012 || Conception and initial launch || Snapchat is conceived of by Stanford graduate students. Initial versions are launched and an initial userbase is obtained.\n|-\n| EPIC GAMER MOMENT December 2012{{snd}}November 2014 || Product build-out, userbase acquisition, funding || Snapchat raises funds in three rounds (Series A: $13.5 million, Series B: $80 million, and Series C: $50 million). The userbase grows significantly, with the number of daily snaps sent growing to 400 million by November 2013. Key features are added to the product, including video sharing, Snapchat Stories, and ephemeral text messaging. Some initial announcements are made regarding monetization.\n|-\n| December 2021{{snd}}August 2101|| Aggressive fundraising, focus on video, more product iterations || Snapchat raises large funding rounds (Series D: $4.85 million, Series E: at least $200 million but possibly up to $500 million, and Series F: $1.8 billion). Since Snapchat raises money more continuously, it is hard to pinpoint specific funding round, creating some confusion for reporting. With the additional funds, Snapchat aggressively improves the product, with changes such as Chat 2.0, the introduction of stickers, and new monetization strategies. Daily video views grow from 2 billion in May 2015 to 6 billion in November 2015 and 10 billion in April 2016. Note, however, that unlike Facebook, that counts a view only after at least three seconds on it (and YouTube, which follows a more restrictive definition), Snapchat counts a view as soon as the video start playing, making its numbers hard to compare with Facebook.<ref name=bloomberg-10-billion>{{cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/snapchat-user-content-fuels-jump-to-10-billion-daily-video-views|title = Snapchat User `Stories' Fuel 10 Billion Daily Video Views|last = Frier|first = Sarah|date = April 28, 2016|accessdate = August 13, 2016|publisher = [[Bloomberg News]]}}</ref>\n|-\n| September 2016{{snd}}present || Rebranding and preparation for IPO || The company rebrands itself from \"Snapchat Inc.\" to \"Snap Inc.\" and unveils the [[Spectacles (product)|Spectacles]].<ref name=\"wsj_spectacles\" /><ref name=\"forbes_rebrand\" /><ref name=\"theverge_rebrand\" /> It also prepares for an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) in 2017.<ref name=\"theverge_ipo\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_ipo\" /><ref name=\"wired_ipo\"/><ref name=\"theverge_ipo2\" /> The IPO occurs on Thursday, March 2, 2017.<ref name=marketwatch-ipo-announcement/><ref name=latimes-IPO/>\n|}\n\n==Full timeline==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

In this context, the widely held view in [[rabbinic literature]] is that the Aggadah is in fact a medium for the transmission of fundamental teachings (Homiletic Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}) or for explanations of verses in the [[Tanakh]] ([[Exegesis|Exegetic]] Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}). In Rabbinic thought, therefore, much of the Aggadah is understood as containing a hidden, allegorical dimension, in addition to its overt, literal sense. In general, where a literal interpretation contradicts rationality, the Rabbis seek an allegorical explanation: \"We are told to use our common sense to decide whether an aggada is to be taken literally or not\" (Carmell, 2005).\n\n===Literal-allegorical teachings===\nRabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], the ''Ramchal'', discusses this two-tiered, literal-allegorical mode of transmission of the Aggadah in his well-known ''Discourse on the Haggadot''. He explains that the Oral Law, in fact, comprises two components: the legal component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the [[mitzvah|mitzvot]] and [[halakha]]; and \"the secret\" component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the deeper teachings. The Aggadah, along with the [[Kabbalah]], falls under the latter. The rabbis of the [[Mishnah]]ic era believed that it would be dangerous to record the deeper teachings in explicit, mishnah-like, medium. Rather, they would be conveyed in a \"concealed mode\" and via \"paradoxes\". (Due to their value, these teachings should not become accessible to those \"of bad character\" and due to their depth they should not be made available to those \"not schooled in the ways of analysis\".) This mode of the transmission was nevertheless based on consistent rules and principles such that those \"equipped with the keys\" would be able to unlock their meaning; to others they would appear as non-rational or fantastic.\n\n===Interpretation of the Aggadah===\nIn line with the above, [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]], in his \"Introduction to the Talmud\", states that \"Aggadah comprises any comment occurring in the Talmud on any topic which is not a [[mitzvah|commandment]] (i.e. which is not [[halakha|halachic]]) and one should derive from it only that which is reasonable.\" As regards this, [[Maimonides]], in his preface to the tenth chapter of [[Mishnah|Tractate]] [[Sanhedrin]] (''Perek Chelek''), describes three possible approaches to the interpretation of the Aggadah.<ref>Summary per [http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/vayechi/elkayam.html discussion] by Dr. Avraham Elkayam, Department of Philosophy, [[Bar Ilan University]]</ref>\n* The first approach is to accept the Aggadah as literally true, without admission of any hidden, allegorical explanation\u2014even where a literal interpretation runs counter to common sense. Maimonides is dismissive of this approach.\n* The second approach is to assume that anything said by the Sages was intended literally, and to therefore reject, as impossible, non-rational or fantastic teachings (and to consequently consider the Sages as \"simpletons and ignoramuses\"). Maimonides does not entirely reject rationalist interpretation, but he opposes an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] approach which denies the Aggadah a hidden rationality. \"The sages presented their ''drashot'' in a style by which the mind of a fool will reject them because of his way of thinking; it is improper to assign any deficiency to the ''drash''\u2014one may rather suspect that the deficiency is a result of his intellectual shortcomings\" (''Commentary on the Mishnah'': Introduction).\n* The third approach is to recognise that many Aggadot are intended to teach profound truths, and that the teachings thus operate on two levels: \"overt\" and \"hidden\". Thus any impossible assertion was, in fact, intended as a parable; further, where aggadot can be understood literally, they may be taken on this level. This is, in general, the view of the Rabbis. \"It is proper\u2026to carefully analyse [the Aggadot]\u2026when any of these seem far-fetched we must immerse ourselves in the various branches of knowledge until we understand the concepts.\" (Maimonides, [[op cit]].)\n\nNote that Maimonides' approach is also widely held amongst the non-rationalistic, [[kabbalah|mystical]] streams of Judaism\u2014thus, for example, Rabbi [[Isaiah Horowitz]], the ''Shlah HaKodosh'' holds that \"none of these sometimes mind-boggling 'stories' are devoid of profound meaning; if anyone is devoid of understanding, it is the reader\" (''Shnei Luchos HaBris'', introduction).\n\n===In the Talmud and Midrash===\nThe Aggadah is today recorded in the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]].\n\nIn the Midrash, the aggadic and halakhic material are compiled as two distinct collections: 1) The Aggadic Midrashim, generally, are explanatory aggadah, deriving the \"sermonic implications\" from the biblical text; and 2) the [[Midrash halakha|Halakhic Midrashim]] derive the laws from the text. Many of the [[meforshim|Torah commentaries]], and the [[Targum]]im, interpret the Torah text in the light of Aggadic statements, particularly those in the Midrash, and hence contain much material on Aggadah interpretation.\n\nThroughout the Talmud, aggadic and halakhic material are interwoven\u2014legal material comprises around 90%. (Tractate [[Avoth]], which has no [[gemara]], deals exclusively with non-halakhic material, though it is not regarded as aggadic in that it is focused, largely, on character development.) The Talmudic Aggadah, generally, convey the \"deeper teachings\"\u2014though in concealed mode, as discussed.

In this context, the widely held view in [[rabbinic literature]] is that the Aggadah is in fact a medium for the transmission of fundamental teachings (Homiletic Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}) or for explanations of verses in the [[Tanakh]] ([[Exegesis|Exegetic]] Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}). In Rabbinic thought, therefore, much of the Aggadah is understood as containing a hidden, allegorical dimension, in addition to its overt, literal sense. In general, where a literal interpretation contradicts rationality, the Rabbis seek an allegorical explanation: \"We are told to use our common sense to decide whether an aggada is to be taken literally or not\" (Carmell, 2005).\n\n===Literal-allegorical teachings===\nRabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], the ''Ramchal'', discusses this two-tiered, literal-allegorical mode of transmission of the Aggadah in his well-known ''Discourse on the Haggadot''. He explains that the Oral Law, in fact, comprises two components: the legal component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the [[mitzvah|mitzvot]] and [[halakha]]; and \"the secret\" component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the deeper teachings. The Aggadah, along with the [[Kabbalah]], falls under the latter. The rabbis of the [[Mishnah]]ic era believed that it would be dangerous to record the deeper teachings in explicit, mishnah-like, medium. Rather, they would be conveyed in a \"concealed mode\" and via \"paradoxes\". (Due to their value, these teachings should not become accessible to those \"of bad character\" and due to their depth they should not be made available to those \"not schooled in the ways of analysis\".) This mode of the transmission was nevertheless based on consistent rules and principles such that those \"equipped with the keys\" would be able to unlock their meaning; to others they would appear as non-rational or fantastic.\n\n===Interpretation of the Aggadah===\nIn line with the above, [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]], in his \"Introduction to the Talmud\", states that \"Aggadah comprises any comment occurring in the Talmud on any topic which is not a [[mitzvah|commandment]] (i.e. which is not [[halakha|halachic]]) and one should derive from it only that which is reasonable.\" As regards this, [[Maimonides]], in his preface to the tenth chapter of [[Mishnah|Tractate]] [[Sanhedrin]] (''Perek Chelek''), describes three possible approaches to the interpretation of the Aggadah.<ref>Summary per [http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/vayechi/elkayam.html discussion] by Dr. Avraham Elkayam, Department of Philosophy, [[Bar Ilan University]]</ref>\n* The first approach is to accept the Aggadah as literally true, without admission of any hidden, allegorical explanation\u2014even where a literal interpretation runs counter to common sense. Maimonides is dismissive of this approach.\n* The second approach is to assume that anything said by the Sages was intended literally, and to therefore reject, as impossible, non-rational or fantastic teachings (and to consequently consider the Sages as \"simpletons and ignoramuses\"). Maimonides does not entirely reject rationalist interpretation, but he opposes an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] approach which denies the Aggadah a hidden rationality. \"The sages presented their ''drashot'' in a style by which the mind of a fool will reject them because of his way of thinking; it is improper to assign any deficiency to the ''drash''\u2014one may rather suspect that the deficiency is a result of his intellectual shortcomings\" (''Commentary on the Mishnah'': Introduction).\n* The third approach is to recognise that many Aggadot are intended to teach profound truths, and that the teachings thus operate on two levels: \"overt\" and \"hidden\". Thus any impossible assertion was, in fact, intended as a parable; further, where aggadot can be understood literally, they may be taken on this level. This is, in general, the view of the Rabbis. \"It is proper\u2026to carefully analyse [the Aggadot]\u2026when any of these seem far-fetched we must immerse ourselves in the various branches of knowledge until we understand the concepts.\" (Maimonides, [[op cit]].)\n\nNote that Maimonides' approach is also widely held amongst the non-rationalistic, [[kabbalah|mystical]] streams of Judaism\u2014thus, for example, Rabbi [[Isaiah Horowitz]], the ''Shlah HaKodosh'' holds that \"none of these sometimes mind-boggling 'stories' are devoid of profound meaning; if anyone is devoid of understanding, it is the reader\" (''Shnei Luchos HaBris'', introduction).\n\n===In the Talmud and Midrash===\nThe Aggadah is today recorded in the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]].\n\nIn the Midrash, the aggadic and halakhic material are compiled as two distinct collections: 1) The Aggadic Midrashim, generally, are explanatory aggadah, deriving the \"sermonic implications\" from the biblical text; and 2) the [[Midrash halakha|Halakhic Midrashim]] derive the laws from the text. Many of the [[meforshim|Torah commentaries]], and the [[Targum]]im, interpret the Torah text in the light of Aggadic statements, particularly those in the Midrash, and hence contain much material on Aggadah interpretation.\n\nThroughout the Talmud, aggadic and halakhic material are interwoven\u2014legal material comprises around 90%. (Tractate [[Avoth]], which has no [[gemara]], deals exclusively with non-halakhic material, though it is not regarded as aggadic in that it is focused, largely, on character development.) The Talmudic Aggadah, generally, convey the \"deeper teachings\"\u2014though in concealed mode, as discussed. The aggadic material in the Babylonian Talmud is also presented separately in ''[[Ein Yaakov]]'', a compilation of the Aggadah together with commentaries.\n\nWell-known works interpreting the Aggadot in the Talmud include:\n* ''Chiddushei Aggados'' (Novellae on the Aggadot) by [[Samuel Edels]] \"the Maharsha.\"\n* ''Chiddushei Aggados'' (Novellae on the Aggadot) by [[Judah Loew]] \"the Maharal\" (as well as many other works by Loew, esp. ''Be'er ha-Golah'').\n* ''Yehoyada'' and ''MeKabtziel'' (names based on [[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]] 23:20) by [[Yosef Hayyim]] \"the Ben Ish Chai.\"\n* ''Beur Aggados'' (Clarification of the Aggadot) and ''Perush al Kamma Aggadot'' (Commentary on several Aggadot) by the [[Vilna Gaon]].\n* ''Ayin Ayah'' Commentary on [[Ein Yaakov]] by [[Rav Kook]]\n* ''En Jacob ([[Ein Yaakov]])'' Agada of the Babylonian Talmud by Rabbi [[Jacob ibn Habib]], Revised and Translated into English by Rabbi S.
