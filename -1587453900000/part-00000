It passes through [[Welzheim]], [[T\u00e4ferrot]], [[Leinzell]] and [[Heuchlingen]], and flows into the Kocher in \n[[Abtsgm\u00fcnd]].\n\n== Geography ==\n=== History ===\nFrom its source at [[Kaisersbach]]\u2013Eulenhof, the river Lein flows quite steadily to the south and in the east past [[Welzheim]]. At [[Alfdorf]]\u2013[[Haghof (Alfdorf)|Haghof]] its course bends off to the east and maintains this direction with slight fluctuations until [[Heuchlingen]], from where it reaches Abtsgm\u00fcnd and the Kocher in northeastern direction. Its catchment area is mainly on its left side, because in its southern upper valley it has a strong competitor on the right side in the nearby [[Wieslauf]] and its tributaries with a clearly deeper [[erosion base]], in the eastern middle course to Heuchlingen the [[Rems (river)|Rems]] tributaries dig the water out of it so much that the watershed follows the Lein itself closely in the south, often only a few hundred meters away from the river itself. Only in the northeast-oriented lower course from Heuchlingen it has any noteworthy right tributaries at all, here it shares the ridge around [[Dewangen]] with the Kocher in about equal parts.

The [[President of India]] is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Navy. The [[Chief of the Naval Staff (India)|Chief of Naval Staff]], a [[four-star rank|four-star]] [[Admiral (India)|admiral]], commands the navy.\n\nThe Indian Navy traces its origins back to the ''[[East India Company's Marine]]'' which was founded in 1612 to protect British merchant shipping in the region. In 1793, the British [[Company rule in India|East India Company]] established its rule over eastern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]] i.e. Bengal, but it was not until 1830 that the colonial navy was titled as ''His Majesty's Indian Navy''. When [[Republic Day (India)|India became a republic]] in 1950, the ''Royal Indian Navy'' as it had been named since 1934 was renamed to ''Indian Navy''.\n\nThe primary objective of the navy is to safeguard the nation's maritime borders, and in conjunction with other Armed Forces of the union, act to deter or defeat any threats or aggression against the territory, people or maritime interests of India, both in war and peace. Through joint exercises, goodwill visits and humanitarian missions, including disaster relief, Indian Navy promotes bilateral relations between nations.\n\nAs of June 2019, Indian Navy has 67,252 active and 55,000 reserve personnel in service and has a fleet of 137 warships and 235 aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=192200|title=Strength of Defence Forces|website=pib.gov.in|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Indian Navy aiming at 200-ship fleet by 2027 |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/indian-navy-aiming-at-200-ship-fleet-by-2027/articleshow/48072917.cms |work=The Economic Times |agency=Press Trust of India |date=14 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"waf-2019\">{{cite web|last1=Hoyle|first1=Craig|last2=Kwiatkowski|first2=Mark|last3=Lewis-Rice|first3=Sandra|last4=Fafard|first4=Antoine|title=World Air Forces 2019|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/asset/26019/waf/|website=FlightGlobal.com|publisher=Flight International|accessdate=24 February 2019|pages=17&ndash;18|url-access=registration}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960838207|title=The Military Balance 2017.|isbn=1-85743-900-7|location=Arundel House, Temple Place, London, UK|oclc=960838207}}</ref>As of March 2018, the operational fleet consists of one [[aircraft carrier]], one [[amphibious transport dock]], eight [[Landing Ship, Tank|landing ship tanks]], eleven [[destroyer]]s, fourteen [[frigate]]s, one [[SSN (hull classification symbol)|nuclear-powered attack submarine]], one [[ballistic missile submarine]], fifteen conventionally-powered attack [[submarine]]s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ins-khanderi-indias-2nd-scorpene-class-submarine-commissioned-by-rajnath-singh-in-mumbai-2108556|title=Khanderi, India's 2nd Scorpene Submarine, Commissioned By Rajnath Singh|website=NDTV.com|language=en|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref> twenty-two [[corvette]]s, one [[mine countermeasure vessel]], four [[Replenishment oiler|fleet tankers]] and various other [[Auxiliary ship|auxiliary vessels]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Indian Navy}}\n\n===Early maritime history===\n{{main|Indian maritime history}} {{further|South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I}} {{further|Maratha Navy}} {{further|Maritime history of Odisha}}\n[[File:Ajanta Cave 2 three-mast sailship.jpg|thumb|right|Three-mast sailship, c. 5th century]]\nThe [[maritime history]] of [[India]] dates back to 6,000 years with the birth of art of the navigation and navigating during the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].<ref name=\"Interesting facts about India - India.gov.in Archive\">{{cite web|title=Interesting facts about India|url=http://india.gov.in/myindia/facts.php|website=India|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=17 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206014250/http://india.gov.in/myindia/facts.php|archivedate=6 December 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> A [[Kutch district|Kutch]] mariner's log book from 19th century recorded that the first tidal dock India has been built at [[Lothal]] around 2300 BC during the Indus Valley Civilisation, near the present day harbour of [[Mangrol, Kathiawar|Mangrol]] on the Gujarat coast.

In the later of his conquest, records show that the Emperor of [[Maurya Empire]], [[Chandragupta Maurya]], as a part of war office, established an Admiralty Division under the Superintendent of Ships. Many historians from ancient India recorded the Indian trade relations with many countries, and even with countries as far as [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]]. There were also references to the trade routes of countries in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] Ocean. India also had trade relations with the [[Greeks]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. At one instance Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder|Gaius Plinius Secundus]] mentioned of Indian traders carrying away large masses of gold and silver from Rome, in payment for skins, precious stones, clothes, indigo, sandalwood, herbs, perfumes, and spices.<ref name=\"Early History of Indian Navy - IN\" />\n\nDuring 5\u201310 AD, the [[Kalinga (province)|Kalinga]] and the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]] Empires conquered Western Java, Sumatra and [[Malay Archipelago|Malaya]].

Ships also had compartments included in their design, so that even if one compartment was damaged, the ship would remain afloat. These features of were developed by Indians even before Europeans were aware of the idea.<ref name=\"Early History of Indian Navy - IN\" />\n\nHowever, by the end of thirteenth century Indian naval power had started to decline, and had reached its low by the time the Portuguese entered India. Soon after they set foot in India, the Portuguese started to hunt down all Asian vessels not permitting their trade. Amidst this, in 1529, a naval war at [[Bombay Harbour]] resulted in the surrender of [[Thane]], [[Karanja, Raigad|Karanja]], and [[Bandora, Goa|Bandora]]. By 1534, the Portuguese took complete control over the Bombay Harbour. The [[Zamorin of Calicut]] challenged the Portuguese trade when [[Vasco da Gama]] refused to pay the customs levy as per the trade agreement. This resulted in two major naval wars, the first one\u2014[[Battle of Cochin (1504)|Battle of Cochin]], was fought in 1504, and the second engagement happened four years later off [[Diu, India|Diu]]. Both these wars, exposed the weakness of Indian maritime power and simultaneously helped the Portuguese to gain mastery over the Indian waters.<ref name=\"Early History of Indian Navy - IN\" />\n\nIn the later seventeenth century Indian naval power observed remarkable revival. The alliance of the [[Mughals|Moghuls]] and the [[Janjira State|Sidis of Janjira]] was marked as a major power on the west coast. On the southern front, the 1st Sovereign of the [[Maratha Empire]], [[Shivaji|Shivaji Bhosale]], started creating his own fleet. His fleet was commanded by notable admirals like [[Sidhoji Gujar]] and [[Kanhoji Angre]]. The Maratha Navy under the leadership of Angre kept the English, Dutch and Portuguese away from the Konkan coast. However, the Marathas witnessed remarkable decline in their naval capabilities following the death of Angre in 1729.<ref name=\"Early History of Indian Navy - IN\" />\n\n===1612 origins to independence===\n{{main|Royal Indian Navy (1612\u20131950)}}\n[[File:Mahratta pirates attacking the sloop 'Aurora', of the Bombay Marine, 1812; end of the action RMG BHC1085.tiff|thumb|left|A depiction of a [[Maratha Navy|Maratha]] naval attack in 1812 against the [[East India Company]]'s ship [[HCS Aurora (1809)|''Aurora'']].]]\n\nThe origins of the Indian Navy date to 1612, when an English vessel under the command of Captain Best encountered the Portuguese. Although the Portuguese were defeated, this incident along with the trouble caused by the pirates to the merchant vessels, forced the British to maintain fleet near [[Surat]], Gujarat. The British Honourable [[East India Company]] (HEIC) formed a naval arm, and the first squadron of fighting ships reached the Gujarat coast on 5 September 1612. Their objective was to protect British merchant shipping off the [[Gulf of Cambay]] and up the [[Narmada]] and [[Tapti]] rivers. As the HEIC continued to expand its rule and influence over different parts of India, the responsibility of Company's Marine increased too.<ref name=\"Genesis of Indian Navy\">{{cite web|title=Genesis of Indian Navy|url=https://www.indiannavy.nic.in/node/1410|website=Indian Navy|accessdate=18 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706075113/https://www.indiannavy.nic.in/node/1410|archivedate=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nOver time, the British predominantly operated from Bombay, and in 1686, the HEIC's naval arm was renamed the Bombay Marine. At times the Bombay Marine engaged Dutch, French, Maratha, and Sidi vessels. Much later, it was also involved in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] of 1824. In 1834, the Bombay Marine became Her Majesty's Indian Navy. The Navy saw action in the [[First Opium War]] of 1840 and in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1852. Due to some unrecorded reasons, the Navy's name reverted to the Bombay Marine from 1863 to 1877, after which it was named Her Majesty's Indian Marine. At that time, the Marine operated in two divisions\u2014the Eastern Division at Calcutta under the Superintendent of Bay of Bengal, and the Western Division at Bombay Superintendent of Arabian Sea.<ref name=\"Genesis of Indian Navy\" />\nIn 1892 the Marine was rechristened the Royal Indian Marine, and by the end of the 19th century it operated over fifty ships. The Marine participated in World War I with a fleet of patrol vessels, troop carriers, and minesweepers. In 1928, D. N. Mukherji was the first Indian to be granted a commission, in the rank of an Engineer [[Sub-lieutenant]]. Also in 1928, the RIM was accorded combatant status, which entitled it to be considered a true fighting force and to fly the [[White Ensign]] of the Royal Navy.{{Sfn|Singh|1986|pp=45\u201346}} In 1934, the Marine was upgraded to a full naval force, thus becoming the Royal Indian Navy (RIN), and was presented the King's colours in recognition of its services to the British Crown.<ref name=\"Genesis of Indian Navy\" />\n\nDuring the early stages of [[World War II]], the tiny Royal Indian Navy consisted of five sloops, one survey vessel, one depot ship, one patrol vessel and numerous assorted small craft; personnel strength was at only 114 officers and 1,732 sailors.{{Sfn|Singh|1986|pp=32\u201333}} The onset of war led to an expansion in numbers of vessels and personnel. By June 1940, the navy had doubled its number in terms of both personnel and material, and expanded nearly six times of its pre-war strength by 1942.{{Sfn|Singh|1986|pp=34}} The navy was actively involved in operations during the war around the world and was heavily involved in operations around the Indian Ocean, including convoy escorts, mine-sweeping and supply, as well as supporting amphibious assaults.<ref name=\"Genesis of Indian Navy\" />\n[[File:HMIS Bombay (305827).jpg|thumb|{{HMIS|Bombay|J249|6}} of Royal Indian Navy in Sydney Harbour during [[World War II]]]]\n\nWhen hostilities ceased in August 1945, the Royal Indian Navy had expanded to a personnel strength of over 25,000 officers and sailors.

In 1951, the Fleet Requirement Unit (FRU) was formed to meet the aviation requirements of the navy.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=262}}\n\nOn 1 January 1953, the charge of [[Cochin]] airfield was handed over to the navy from the [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)|Directorate General of Civil Aviation]]. On 11 March, the FRU was commissioned at Cochin with ten newly acquired [[Short Sealand|Sealand]] aircraft. The navy's first air station, [[INS Garuda|INS ''Garuda'']], was commissioned two months later. From February 1955 to December 1958, ten [[Fairey Firefly|Firefly]] aircraft were acquired. To meet the training requirements of the pilots, the indigenously developed [[HAL HT-2]] trainer was inducted into the FRU. On 17 January 1959, the FRU was commissioned as [[INAS 550|Indian Naval Air Squadron (INAS) 550]], to be the first Indian naval air squadron.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2000|p=262}}\n\n[[File:HAL Dhruv during special operation.jpg|thumb|left|[[HAL Dhruv]] during special operation]]\n\nCurrently the air arm operates an aircraft carrier INS ''Vikramaditya'' with ability to carry over thirty aircraft including MiG 29K, Kamov 31, Kamov 28, Sea King and domestic-built HAL-Dhruv and Chetak helicopters.<ref name=\"Antony to commission MIG-29 K fighters into Navy\">{{cite web|title=Antony to commission MIG-29 K fighters into Navy|url=http://www.news18.com/news/india/antony-to-commission-mig-29-k-fighters-into-navy-607512.html|website=News 18|accessdate=17 July 2017|date=6 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115193746/http://www.news18.com/news/india/antony-to-commission-mig-29-k-fighters-into-navy-607512.html|archivedate=15 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"About INS Vikramaditya - The newest & largest ship of Indian Navy\">{{cite web|title=About INS Vikramaditya \u2013 The newest & largest ship of Indian Navy|url=https://www.indiannavy.nic.in/content/about-ins-vikramaditya-newest-largest-ship-indian-navy|website=Indian Navy|accessdate=17 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731153146/https://www.indiannavy.nic.in/content/about-ins-vikramaditya-newest-largest-ship-indian-navy|archivedate=31 July 2017}}</ref> The Kamov-31 choppers also provide the [[airborne early warning]] cover for the fleet.<ref name=\"Kamov Ka-31 Helix Airborne Early Warning Helicopter\">{{cite web|title=Kamov Ka-31 Helix Airborne Early Warning Helicopter|url=http://www.military-today.com/helicopters/kamov_ka31.htm|website=Military Today|accessdate=17 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731162627/http://www.military-today.com/helicopters/kamov_ka31.htm|archivedate=31 July 2017}}</ref> In the anti-submarine role, the [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]], [[Ka-28]], and the domestic built [[HAL Dhruv]] are used.{{Sfn|Hiranandani|2005|pp=88\u201389}}<ref name=\"Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH- DHRUV) - HAL\">{{cite web|title=Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH- DHRUV)|url=http://www.hal-india.com/Product_Details.aspx?Mkey=54&lKey=&CKey=24|website=Hindustan Aeronautics Limited|accessdate=17 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702093758/http://hal-india.com/Product_Details.aspx?Mkey=54&lKey=&CKey=24|archivedate=2 July 2017}}</ref> The [[MARCOS]] also use Sea King and HAL Dhruv helicopters while conducting operations.

In 1793, the British [[Company rule in India|East India Company]] established its rule over eastern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]] i.e. Bengal, but it was not until 1830 that the colonial navy was titled as ''His Majesty's Indian Navy''. When [[Republic Day (India)|India became a republic]] in 1950, the ''Royal Indian Navy'' as it had been named since 1934 was renamed to ''Indian Navy''.\n\nThe primary objective of the navy is to safeguard the nation's maritime borders, and in conjunction with other Armed Forces of the union, act to deter or defeat any threats or aggression against the territory, people or maritime interests of India, both in war and peace.

These features of were developed by Indians even before Europeans were aware of the idea.<ref name=\"Early History of Indian Navy - IN\" />\n\nHowever, by the end of thirteenth century Indian naval power had started to decline, and had reached its low by the time the Portuguese entered India. Soon after they set foot in India, the Portuguese started to hunt down all Asian vessels not permitting their trade. Amidst this, in 1529, a naval war at [[Bombay Harbour]] resulted in the surrender of [[Thane]], [[Karanja, Raigad|Karanja]], and [[Bandora, Goa|Bandora]]. By 1534, the Portuguese took complete control over the Bombay Harbour. The [[Zamorin of Calicut]] challenged the Portuguese trade when [[Vasco da Gama]] refused to pay the customs levy as per the trade agreement. This resulted in two major naval wars, the first one\u2014[[Battle of Cochin (1504)|Battle of Cochin]], was fought in 1504, and the second engagement happened four years later off [[Diu, India|Diu]]. Both these wars, exposed the weakness of Indian maritime power and simultaneously helped the Portuguese to gain mastery over the Indian waters.<ref name=\"Early History of Indian Navy - IN\" />\n\nIn the later seventeenth century Indian naval power observed remarkable revival. The alliance of the [[Mughals|Moghuls]] and the [[Janjira State|Sidis of Janjira]] was marked as a major power on the west coast. On the southern front, the 1st Sovereign of the [[Maratha Empire]], [[Shivaji|Shivaji Bhosale]], started creating his own fleet. His fleet was commanded by notable admirals like [[Sidhoji Gujar]] and [[Kanhoji Angre]]. The Maratha Navy under the leadership of Angre kept the English, Dutch and Portuguese away from the Konkan coast. However, the Marathas witnessed remarkable decline in their naval capabilities following the death of Angre in 1729.<ref name=\"Early History of Indian Navy - IN\" />\n\n===1612 origins to independence===\n{{main|Royal Indian Navy (1612\u20131950)}}\n[[File:Mahratta pirates attacking the sloop 'Aurora', of the Bombay Marine, 1812; end of the action RMG BHC1085.tiff|thumb|left|A depiction of a [[Maratha Navy|Maratha]] naval attack in 1812 against the [[East India Company]]'s ship [[HCS Aurora (1809)|''Aurora'']].]]\n\nThe origins of the Indian Navy date to 1612, when an English vessel under the command of Captain Best encountered the Portuguese. Although the Portuguese were defeated, this incident along with the trouble caused by the pirates to the merchant vessels, forced the British to maintain fleet near [[Surat]], Gujarat. The British Honourable [[East India Company]] (HEIC) formed a naval arm, and the first squadron of fighting ships reached the Gujarat coast on 5 September 1612. Their objective was to protect British merchant shipping off the [[Gulf of Cambay]] and up the [[Narmada]] and [[Tapti]] rivers. As the HEIC continued to expand its rule and influence over different parts of India, the responsibility of Company's Marine increased too.<ref name=\"Genesis of Indian Navy\">{{cite web|title=Genesis of Indian Navy|url=https://www.indiannavy.nic.in/node/1410|website=Indian Navy|accessdate=18 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706075113/https://www.indiannavy.nic.in/node/1410|archivedate=6 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOver time, the British predominantly operated from Bombay, and in 1686, the HEIC's naval arm was renamed the Bombay Marine. At times the Bombay Marine engaged Dutch, French, Maratha, and Sidi vessels. Much later, it was also involved in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] of 1824. In 1834, the Bombay Marine became Her Majesty's Indian Navy. The Navy saw action in the [[First Opium War]] of 1840 and in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1852. Due to some unrecorded reasons, the Navy's name reverted to the Bombay Marine from 1863 to 1877, after which it was named Her Majesty's Indian Marine. At that time, the Marine operated in two divisions\u2014the Eastern Division at Calcutta under the Superintendent of Bay of Bengal, and the Western Division at Bombay Superintendent of Arabian Sea.<ref name=\"Genesis of Indian Navy\" />\nIn 1892 the Marine was rechristened the Royal Indian Marine, and by the end of the 19th century it operated over fifty ships. The Marine participated in World War I with a fleet of patrol vessels, troop carriers, and minesweepers. In 1928, D. N. Mukherji was the first Indian to be granted a commission, in the rank of an Engineer [[Sub-lieutenant]]. Also in 1928, the RIM was accorded combatant status, which entitled it to be considered a true fighting force and to fly the [[White Ensign]] of the Royal Navy.{{Sfn|Singh|1986|pp=45\u201346}} In 1934, the Marine was upgraded to a full naval force, thus becoming the Royal Indian Navy (RIN), and was presented the King's colours in recognition of its services to the British Crown.<ref name=\"Genesis of Indian Navy\" />\n\nDuring the early stages of [[World War II]], the tiny Royal Indian Navy consisted of five sloops, one survey vessel, one depot ship, one patrol vessel and numerous assorted small craft; personnel strength was at only 114 officers and 1,732 sailors.{{Sfn|Singh|1986|pp=32\u201333}} The onset of war led to an expansion in numbers of vessels and personnel.

Later that year officers and sailors from the Indian Navy were sent to Britain for [[pilot training]].

It was founded by lead singer and guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] and bassist [[Krist Novoselic]].  Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the best known being [[Dave Grohl]], who joined in 1990. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|death of Cobain]], their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern [[rock and roll]] culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle [[grunge]] scene, releasing its first album, ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', for the independent record label [[Sub Pop]] in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label [[DGC Records]] in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", the first single from their landmark second album ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, the album went on to be certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/nevermind-at-25-how-nirvanas-1991-album-changed-the-cultural-lan/|title=Nevermind at 25: how Nirvana's 1991 album changed the cultural landscape|last=Hall|first=James|date=September 24, 2016|work=The Telegraph|access-date=December 2, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Nirvana's sudden success popularized [[alternative rock]], and Cobain found himself described as the \"spokesman of a generation\" and Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of [[Generation X]].<ref>Azerrad, Michael.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080109140249/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nirvana/articles/story/5937982/inside_the_heart_and_mind_of_nirvana \"Inside the Heart and Mind of Nirvana\"].

Its abrasive, less mainstream sound challenged the band's audience, and though less successful than ''Nevermind'', it was a commercial success. Nirvana disbanded following the death of Cobain in 1994. Various posthumous releases have been  overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow [[Courtney Love]].

Nirvana utilized dynamic contrasts in its music, present in this song in the form of a sparse two-note guitar verse guitar melody and choruses of strummed [[power chord]]s.<ref name=\"Chappel\">Chappell, Jon. \"Nirvana's music\". ''Guitar''. June 1993.</ref>}}\nCobain described Nirvana's initial sound as \"a [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] and [[Scratch Acid]] ripoff\".<ref name=\"Azerrad, 1994. p. 294\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 294</ref> When Nirvana recorded ''Bleach'', Cobain felt he had to fit the expectations of the Sub Pop grunge sound to build a fanbase, and suppressed his arty and pop songwriting in favor of a more rock sound.<ref name=\"Az 102\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 102</ref> Nirvana biographer [[Michael Azerrad]] argued, \"Ironically, it was the restrictions of the Sub Pop sound that helped the band find its musical identity.\" Azerrad stated that by acknowledging that they had grown up listening to [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Aerosmith]], they had been able to move on from their derivative early sound.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 103</ref>\n\nNirvana used dynamic shifts that went from quiet to loud.<ref name=\"FrickeRS1994\" /> Cobain sought to mix heavy and pop musical sounds, saying, \"I wanted to be totally [[Led Zeppelin]] in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock and then do real wimpy pop songs.\" When Cobain heard the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]' 1988 album ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' after recording ''Bleach'', he felt it had the sound he wanted to achieve but had been too intimidated to try. The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 103\u20134</ref> Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between \"spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals\".<ref>Kanter, L.A. \"Kurt Cobain's Well-Tempered Tantrums\". ''Guitar Player''. February 1992.</ref> Near the end of his life, Cobain said the band had become bored of the \"limited\" formula, but expressed doubt that they were skilled enough to try other dynamics.<ref name=\"FrickeRS1994\" />\n\nCobain's rhythm guitar style, which relied on [[power chord]]s, low-note riffs, and a loose left-handed technique, featured the key components to the band's songs. Cobain would often initially play a song's verse riff in a clean tone, then double it with distorted guitars when he repeated the part. In some songs the guitar would be absent from the verses entirely to allow the drums and bass guitar to support the vocals, or it would only play sparse melodies like the two-note pattern used in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Cobain rarely played standard guitar solos, opting to play variations of the song's melody as single note lines. Cobain's solos were mostly blues-based and discordant, which music writer Jon Chappell described as \"almost an iconoclastic parody of the traditional instrumental break\", a quality typified by the note-for-note replication of the lead melody in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and the atonal solo for \"Breed\".<ref name=\"Chappel\" /> The band had no formal musical training; Cobain said: \"I have no concept of knowing how to be a musician at all what-so-ever... I couldn't even pass Guitar 101\".<ref>Nirvana Rare Full Interview 1993 [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rhotCKLwcQ&t=1m57s] Seattle,  August 10, 1993.

''[[Melody Maker]]''. March 18, 1989.</ref> Cobain came up with the basic components of each song (usually writing them on an acoustic guitar), as well as the singing style and the lyrics. He emphasized that Novoselic and Grohl \"have a big part in deciding on how long a song should be and how many parts it should have. So I don't like to be considered the sole songwriter\".<ref name=\"making Nevermind\">di Perna, Alan. \"The Making of ''Nevermind''\". ''Guitar World''. Fall 1996.</ref> When asked which part of the songs he would write first, Cobain responded, \"I don\u2019t know. I really don't know. I guess I start with the verse and then go into the chorus\".<ref name=\"FrickeRS1994\" />\n\nCobain usually wrote lyrics for songs minutes before recording them.<ref name=\"making Nevermind\" /> Cobain said, \"When I write a song the lyrics are the least important subject. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all\".<ref>Robb, John. \"White Heat\". ''Sounds''. October 21, 1989.</ref> Cobain told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in 1993 that he \"didn't give a flying fuck\" what the lyrics on ''Bleach'' were about, figuring \"Let's just scream some negative lyrics and as long as they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay\", while the lyrics to ''Nevermind'' were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to ''In Utero'' were \"more focused, they're almost built on themes\".<ref name=\"smashing\">Steinke, Darcey. \"Smashing Their Heads on That Punk Rock\". ''Spin''. October 1993.</ref> Cobain didn't write necessarily in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; the songwriter explained, \"I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [.. The songs are] like a mixture of both of them. That's how most people my age are\".<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 210\u201311</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{See also|Alternative rock#Popularization in the 1990s|label 1=Alternative rock: Popularization in the 1990s}}\n[[File:EMP Museum - Nirvana (15632245508).jpg|left|thumb|240x240px|Nirvana memorabilia at [[EMP Museum]] in [[Seattle]], Washington]]\nNirvana is one of [[list of best-selling music artists|the best-selling bands]] of all time, having sold over 75 million records worldwide.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">[http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2009/03/21/nirvana-vinyl-releases.html \"Nirvana catalogue to be released on vinyl\"].

It was founded by lead singer and guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] and bassist [[Krist Novoselic]].  Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the best known being [[Dave Grohl]], who joined in 1990. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|death of Cobain]], their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern [[rock and roll]] culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle [[grunge]] scene, releasing its first album, ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', for the independent record label [[Sub Pop]] in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label [[DGC Records]] in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", the first single from their landmark second album ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, the album went on to be certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/nevermind-at-25-how-nirvanas-1991-album-changed-the-cultural-lan/|title=Nevermind at 25: how Nirvana's 1991 album changed the cultural landscape|last=Hall|first=James|date=September 24, 2016|work=The Telegraph|access-date=December 2, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Nirvana's sudden success popularized [[alternative rock]], and Cobain found himself described as the \"spokesman of a generation\" and Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of [[Generation X]].<ref>Azerrad, Michael.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080109140249/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nirvana/articles/story/5937982/inside_the_heart_and_mind_of_nirvana \"Inside the Heart and Mind of Nirvana\"].

Its abrasive, less mainstream sound challenged the band's audience, and though less successful than ''Nevermind'', it was a commercial success. Nirvana disbanded following the death of Cobain in 1994. Various posthumous releases have been  overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow [[Courtney Love]]. The posthumous live album ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]]'' (1994) won the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 1996.\n\nDuring their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana was awarded an [[American Music Awards|American Music Award]], [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]], [[Grammy Award]], seven [[MTV Video Music Award]]s and two [[NME Awards]].

Nirvana utilized dynamic contrasts in its music, present in this song in the form of a sparse two-note guitar verse guitar melody and choruses of strummed [[power chord]]s.<ref name=\"Chappel\">Chappell, Jon. \"Nirvana's music\". ''Guitar''. June 1993.</ref>}}\nCobain described Nirvana's initial sound as \"a [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] and [[Scratch Acid]] ripoff\".<ref name=\"Azerrad, 1994. p. 294\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 294</ref> When Nirvana recorded ''Bleach'', Cobain felt he had to fit the expectations of the Sub Pop grunge sound to build a fanbase, and suppressed his arty and pop songwriting in favor of a more rock sound.<ref name=\"Az 102\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 102</ref> Nirvana biographer [[Michael Azerrad]] argued, \"Ironically, it was the restrictions of the Sub Pop sound that helped the band find its musical identity.\" Azerrad stated that by acknowledging that they had grown up listening to [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Aerosmith]], they had been able to move on from their derivative early sound.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 103</ref>\n\nNirvana used dynamic shifts that went from quiet to loud.<ref name=\"FrickeRS1994\" /> Cobain sought to mix heavy and pop musical sounds, saying, \"I wanted to be totally [[Led Zeppelin]] in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock and then do real wimpy pop songs.\" When Cobain heard the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]' 1988 album ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' after recording ''Bleach'', he felt it had the sound he wanted to achieve but had been too intimidated to try. The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 103\u20134</ref> Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between \"spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals\".<ref>Kanter, L.A. \"Kurt Cobain's Well-Tempered Tantrums\". ''Guitar Player''. February 1992.</ref> Near the end of his life, Cobain said the band had become bored of the \"limited\" formula, but expressed doubt that they were skilled enough to try other dynamics.<ref name=\"FrickeRS1994\" />\n\nCobain's rhythm guitar style, which relied on [[power chord]]s, low-note riffs, and a loose left-handed technique, featured the key components to the band's songs. Cobain would often initially play a song's verse riff in a clean tone, then double it with distorted guitars when he repeated the part. In some songs the guitar would be absent from the verses entirely to allow the drums and bass guitar to support the vocals, or it would only play sparse melodies like the two-note pattern used in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Cobain rarely played standard guitar solos, opting to play variations of the song's melody as single note lines. Cobain's solos were mostly blues-based and discordant, which music writer Jon Chappell described as \"almost an iconoclastic parody of the traditional instrumental break\", a quality typified by the note-for-note replication of the lead melody in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and the atonal solo for \"Breed\".<ref name=\"Chappel\" /> The band had no formal musical training; Cobain said: \"I have no concept of knowing how to be a musician at all what-so-ever... I couldn't even pass Guitar 101\".<ref>Nirvana Rare Full Interview 1993 [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rhotCKLwcQ&t=1m57s] Seattle,  August 10, 1993.

''[[Melody Maker]]''. March 18, 1989.</ref> Cobain came up with the basic components of each song (usually writing them on an acoustic guitar), as well as the singing style and the lyrics. He emphasized that Novoselic and Grohl \"have a big part in deciding on how long a song should be and how many parts it should have. So I don't like to be considered the sole songwriter\".<ref name=\"making Nevermind\">di Perna, Alan. \"The Making of ''Nevermind''\". ''Guitar World''.

I guess I start with the verse and then go into the chorus\".<ref name=\"FrickeRS1994\" />\n\nCobain usually wrote lyrics for songs minutes before recording them.<ref name=\"making Nevermind\" /> Cobain said, \"When I write a song the lyrics are the least important subject. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all\".<ref>Robb, John. \"White Heat\". ''Sounds''. October 21, 1989.</ref> Cobain told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in 1993 that he \"didn't give a flying fuck\" what the lyrics on ''Bleach'' were about, figuring \"Let's just scream some negative lyrics and as long as they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay\", while the lyrics to ''Nevermind'' were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to ''In Utero'' were \"more focused, they're almost built on themes\".<ref name=\"smashing\">Steinke, Darcey. \"Smashing Their Heads on That Punk Rock\". ''Spin''. October 1993.</ref> Cobain didn't write necessarily in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; the songwriter explained, \"I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [.. The songs are] like a mixture of both of them. That's how most people my age are\".<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 210\u201311</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{See also|Alternative rock#Popularization in the 1990s|label 1=Alternative rock: Popularization in the 1990s}}\n[[File:EMP Museum - Nirvana (15632245508).jpg|left|thumb|240x240px|Nirvana memorabilia at [[EMP Museum]] in [[Seattle]], Washington]]\nNirvana is one of [[list of best-selling music artists|the best-selling bands]] of all time, having sold over 75 million records worldwide.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">[http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2009/03/21/nirvana-vinyl-releases.html \"Nirvana catalogue to be released on vinyl\"].
