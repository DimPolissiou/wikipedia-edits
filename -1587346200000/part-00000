However, as his activities became centered in [[Kyoto]], he kept a house in Kyoto. He also had his adopted son-in-law, [[Sen Sh\u014dan]], who was married to his daughter Okame, move from Sakai to Kyoto, leaving his natural son, [[Sen D\u014dan]], to tend the family home and business in Sakai. This represents the origin of the two branches of the Sen family (Senke) referred to as the Sakai-Senke and Ky\u014d-Senke. The Ky\u014d-Senke, headed by Sen Sh\u014dan, eventually settled in a house located on Ogawa Street, in the neighborhood of [[Honp\u014d-ji (Kyoto)]] temple; the house and property representing the original Sen estate in Kyoto. Following the death of Riky\u016b, both Sen D\u014dan of the Sakai-Senke and Sen Sh\u014dan of the Ky\u014d-Senke, inevitably caught up in the wrath of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] which had been the reason for Riky\u016b's self-immolation, were in danger of also losing their lives, and so, to protect their homes and families, they went into hiding. After a number of months, however, they both were able to return home. In the end, Sen D\u014dan, back in Sakai, left no successors to carry on the Sakai-Senke. On the other hand, Sen Sh\u014dan, returning home to Kyoto, already had a son, [[Sen S\u014dtan]], born between him and Okame, to succeed him as head of the Ky\u014d-Senke.<ref>Sen S\u014dsa, Sen S\u014dshitsu, Sen S\u014dsh\u016b supv. eds, ''Riky\u016b Daijiten'' (\u5229\u4f11\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, \"Riky\u016b Encyclopedia\") entries for \"Sakai Senke\" and \"Ky\u014d-Senke\".

After his first wife's death, S\u014dtan remarried, and between him and his second wife there were born his third son, [[K\u014dshin S\u014dsa]] (1613-1672), a daughter named Kure (dates uncertain), and his fourth son, [[Sens\u014d S\u014dshitsu]] (1622-1697). Kan'\u014d S\u014dsetsu and Ichi\u014d S\u014dsh\u016b began living independently when they were young men. Also, Sens\u014d left the family as a young man, to apprentice under a local doctor named Noma Gentaku. Due to the untimely death of Noma Gentaku, however, Sens\u014d returned home in 1645, and thereafter, with his father S\u014dtan's support, followed a course of life as a chanoyu expert, like his elder brother K\u014dshin S\u014dsa was doing as the apparent heir to the Sen house and its chad\u014d tradition. Around the year 1646, when S\u014dtan was about 68 years old, he gave up his family headship to K\u014dshin S\u014dsa, and moved into quarters which had been built at the rear of the house, and which included a tiny tea hut, the {{Nihongo|Konnichian|\u4eca\u65e5\u5eb5, \"Hut of This Day\"}}.<ref>Iguchi Kaisen, et. al., supervising eds., ''Genshoku Chad\u014d Daijiten'' (\u539f\u8272\u8336\u9053\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, \"Color-illustrated Chad\u014d Encyclopedia\"), entry for \"Sen no S\u014dtan.\" Tankosha Pub.

On the other hand, S\u014dtan's second son, Kan'\u014d S\u014dsetsu, had been adopted by the Yoshioka family of lacquer-ware specialists in Kyoto, who were known by their business name, Yoshimonjiya. During this period, he went by the name Yoshioka Kan'uemon. In his later life, however, he reverted to the Sen family, established a tea room named \"Kankyuan\" at his residence on Mushak\u014dji street, and began to follow a course of life as a chanoyu expert. With this, Riky\u016b's chanoyu ideals and legacy as carried forward by his direct descendants branched into the three lines of the Sen family referred to as the san-Senke.<ref>''Riky\u016b Daijiten'' entry for \"S\u014dtan no t\u014djy\u014d\" (\"S\u014dtan enters the stage\"), p. 114.</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868), the heads of the three families, respectfully, were in service as chad\u014d magistrates under various [[daimy\u014d]], and received an adequate stipend from them. In the case of the family that eventually came to be known as the Urasenke, Sens\u014d was in service to the Maeda clan of Kaga. During the following generations, the Urasenke family head also came to serve as chad\u014d magistrate for the Hisamatsu clan of the Iyo Domain, in present-day [[Ehime prefecture]], as well as caretaker for that family's Kyoto residence. The eleventh generation family head, Gengensai (1810-77), who was born as the fifth son of a minor daimy\u014d named Matsudaira Noritomo of the Mikawa Okudono domain and married into the Urasenke family, also served the [[Owari branch]] of the [[Tokugawa family]]. With the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1868), however, the daimy\u014d lost their positions, and the hereditary stipends which the three Sen families had been receiving came to an end. It was after this, and the loss of their positions serving the daimy\u014d, that the Sen families established their [[iemoto]] system.<ref>Chanoyu Quarterly no. 73, \"The Diffusion of the Way of Tea\" p. 5-6.

Sen no Riky\u016b is their mutual first generation; that is, their  mutual family founder (\u7956). Sen Sh\u014dan is their mutual second generation. Sen S\u014dtan is their mutual third generation. Then, from the fourth generation, their family lineages divide. It is from the fourth generation that the heads of the three separate families came to carry the [[Japanese name#Professional names|hereditary professional name]] which has been used by the successive heads of their respective family. The head (''[[iemoto]]'') of the Urasenke family and its school of chad\u014d assumes the hereditary professional name S\u014dshitsu upon succession, to become officially referred to as [[Sen S\u014dshitsu]]. The present head is Zab\u014dsai Genmoku S\u014dshitsu; he is the 16th generation in the line (Sen S\u014dshitsu XVI).\n\n[[File:2007 06 19 Maria Kaczynska 01.jpg|thumb|Sen S\u014dshitsu XV (2007)]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

However, as his activities became centered in [[Kyoto]], he kept a house in Kyoto. He also had his adopted son-in-law, [[Sen Sh\u014dan]], who was married to his daughter Okame, move from Sakai to Kyoto, leaving his natural son, [[Sen D\u014dan]], to tend the family home and business in Sakai. This represents the origin of the two branches of the Sen family (Senke) referred to as the Sakai-Senke and Ky\u014d-Senke. The Ky\u014d-Senke, headed by Sen Sh\u014dan, eventually settled in a house located on Ogawa Street, in the neighborhood of [[Honp\u014d-ji (Kyoto)]] temple; the house and property representing the original Sen estate in Kyoto. Following the death of Riky\u016b, both Sen D\u014dan of the Sakai-Senke and Sen Sh\u014dan of the Ky\u014d-Senke, inevitably caught up in the wrath of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] which had been the reason for Riky\u016b's self-immolation, were in danger of also losing their lives, and so, to protect their homes and families, they went into hiding. After a number of months, however, they both were able to return home. In the end, Sen D\u014dan, back in Sakai, left no successors to carry on the Sakai-Senke. On the other hand, Sen Sh\u014dan, returning home to Kyoto, already had a son, [[Sen S\u014dtan]], born between him and Okame, to succeed him as head of the Ky\u014d-Senke.<ref>Sen S\u014dsa, Sen S\u014dshitsu, Sen S\u014dsh\u016b supv. eds, ''Riky\u016b Daijiten'' (\u5229\u4f11\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, \"Riky\u016b Encyclopedia\") entries for \"Sakai Senke\" and \"Ky\u014d-Senke\".

After his first wife's death, S\u014dtan remarried, and between him and his second wife there were born his third son, [[K\u014dshin S\u014dsa]] (1613-1672), a daughter named Kure (dates uncertain), and his fourth son, [[Sens\u014d S\u014dshitsu]] (1622-1697). Kan'\u014d S\u014dsetsu and Ichi\u014d S\u014dsh\u016b began living independently when they were young men. Also, Sens\u014d left the family as a young man, to apprentice under a local doctor named Noma Gentaku. Due to the untimely death of Noma Gentaku, however, Sens\u014d returned home in 1645, and thereafter, with his father S\u014dtan's support, followed a course of life as a chanoyu expert, like his elder brother K\u014dshin S\u014dsa was doing as the apparent heir to the Sen house and its chad\u014d tradition. Around the year 1646, when S\u014dtan was about 68 years old, he gave up his family headship to K\u014dshin S\u014dsa, and moved into quarters which had been built at the rear of the house, and which included a tiny tea hut, the {{Nihongo|Konnichian|\u4eca\u65e5\u5eb5, \"Hut of This Day\"}}.<ref>Iguchi Kaisen, et. al., supervising eds., ''Genshoku Chad\u014d Daijiten'' (\u539f\u8272\u8336\u9053\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, \"Color-illustrated Chad\u014d Encyclopedia\"), entry for \"Sen no S\u014dtan.\" Tankosha Pub.

On the other hand, S\u014dtan's second son, Kan'\u014d S\u014dsetsu, had been adopted by the Yoshioka family of lacquer-ware specialists in Kyoto, who were known by their business name, Yoshimonjiya. During this period, he went by the name Yoshioka Kan'uemon. In his later life, however, he reverted to the Sen family, established a tea room named \"Kankyuan\" at his residence on Mushak\u014dji street, and began to follow a course of life as a chanoyu expert. With this, Riky\u016b's chanoyu ideals and legacy as carried forward by his direct descendants branched into the three lines of the Sen family referred to as the san-Senke.<ref>''Riky\u016b Daijiten'' entry for \"S\u014dtan no t\u014djy\u014d\" (\"S\u014dtan enters the stage\"), p. 114.</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868), the heads of the three families, respectfully, were in service as chad\u014d magistrates under various [[daimy\u014d]], and received an adequate stipend from them. In the case of the family that eventually came to be known as the Urasenke, Sens\u014d was in service to the Maeda clan of Kaga. During the following generations, the Urasenke family head also came to serve as chad\u014d magistrate for the Hisamatsu clan of the Iyo Domain, in present-day [[Ehime prefecture]], as well as caretaker for that family's Kyoto residence. The eleventh generation family head, Gengensai (1810-77), who was born as the fifth son of a minor daimy\u014d named Matsudaira Noritomo of the Mikawa Okudono domain and married into the Urasenke family, also served the [[Owari branch]] of the [[Tokugawa family]]. With the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1868), however, the daimy\u014d lost their positions, and the hereditary stipends which the three Sen families had been receiving came to an end. It was after this, and the loss of their positions serving the daimy\u014d, that the Sen families established their [[iemoto]] system.<ref>Chanoyu Quarterly no. 73, \"The Diffusion of the Way of Tea\" p. 5-6.

Sen no Riky\u016b is their mutual first generation; that is, their  mutual family founder (\u7956). Sen Sh\u014dan is their mutual second generation. Sen S\u014dtan is their mutual third generation. Then, from the fourth generation, their family lineages divide. It is from the fourth generation that the heads of the three separate families came to carry the [[Japanese name#Professional names|hereditary professional name]] which has been used by the successive heads of their respective family. The head (''[[iemoto]]'') of the Urasenke family and its school of chad\u014d assumes the hereditary professional name S\u014dshitsu upon succession, to become officially referred to as [[Sen S\u014dshitsu]]. The present head is Zab\u014dsai Genmoku S\u014dshitsu; he is the 16th generation in the line (Sen S\u014dshitsu XVI).\n\n[[File:2007 06 19 Maria Kaczynska 01.jpg|thumb|Sen S\u014dshitsu XV (2007)]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Each district has a liaison council for the Gakk\u014d Chad\u014d (Tea Training in the Educational System) program sponsored by the organization. There are also 167 groups belonging to the organization's Seinenbu, or \"Youth Division.\" These three entities organize seminars, tea gatherings, conventions, and many other activities. The central office, serving to coordinate the programs and activities of all these, is located in the Urasenke Center building at Urasenke headquarters, Kyoto. Twice a year, in the spring and autumn, it calls together a national meeting of chapter presidents, to decide upon general policies and activities. In 1999, the International Division of the Urasenke Foundation was moved under the umbrella of this office, effectively extending the organization to overseas regions. Currently there are 92 official Chad\u014d Urasenke Tank\u014dkai associations spread over 37 countries outside Japan.<ref>Urasenke Konnichian English website page \"Urasenke Tankokai Federation,\" at http://www.urasenke.or.jp/texte/organ/tankokai/index_tan.html.
