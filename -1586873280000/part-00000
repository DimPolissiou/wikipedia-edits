Large parts of the continent were essentially uninhabitable for Europeans because of the high mortality rates from diseases such as malaria.<ref>Thomas Pakenham, ''The Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912'' (1991) ch 1</ref> In the middle decades of the 19th century, European explorers had mapped  areas of [[East Africa]] and [[Central Africa]].\n\nEven as late as the 1870s, Western European states controlled only ten percent of the African continent, with all their territories located near the coast. The most important holdings were [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], held by Portugal; the [[Cape Colony]], held by the United Kingdom; and [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], held by [[France in the nineteenth century|France]].

Industrialisation brought about rapid advancements in transportation and communication, especially in the forms of steamships, railways and telegraphs. Medical advances also played an important role, especially medicines for [[tropical disease]]s. The development of [[quinine]], an effective treatment for [[malaria]], made vast expanses of the tropics more accessible for Europeans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/quinine|title=Quinine|website=broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n\n===Africa and global markets===\n\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\n\n[[Sub-Saharan Africa]], one of the last regions of the world largely untouched by \"informal imperialism\", was also attractive to Europe's ruling elites for economic, political and social reasons. During a time when Britain's [[balance of trade]] showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly [[protectionism|protectionist]] continental markets due to the [[Long Depression]] (1873\u201396), Africa offered [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and other countries an open market that would garner them a [[trade surplus]]: a market that bought more from the colonial power than it sold overall.<ref name=\"Shillington\" /><ref>Ewout Frankema, Jeffrey Williamson, and Pieter Woltjer, \"An Economic Rationale for the West African Scramble?

Another inducement for imperialism arose from the demand for raw materials, especially [[copper]], cotton, rubber, [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], diamonds, tea, and [[tin]], to which European consumers had grown accustomed and upon which European industry had grown dependent. Additionally, Britain wanted the southern and eastern coasts of Africa for stopover ports on the route to Asia and its empire in India.<ref>Lynn Hunt, ''The Making of the West'': volume C, Bedford: St. Martin, 2009.</ref> However, in Africa \u2013 excluding the area which became the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 \u2013 the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small, compared to other continents. Consequently, the companies involved in tropical African commerce were relatively small, apart from [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[De Beers Mining Company]]. Rhodes had carved out [[Rhodesia]] for himself; [[Leopold II of Belgium]] later, and with considerable brutality, exploited the [[Congo Free State]].\n\nThese events might detract from the pro-imperialist arguments of colonial lobbyists such as the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'', [[Francesco Crispi]] and [[Jules Ferry]], who argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and [[overproduction]] caused by shrinking continental markets. [[John A.

The vast interior between [[Egypt]] and the gold and diamond-rich [[southern Africa]] had strategic value in securing the flow of overseas trade. Britain was under political pressure to secure lucrative markets against encroaching rivals in [[Qing|China]] and its eastern colonies, particularly [[British India|India]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Thus, it was crucial to secure the key waterway between East and West&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Suez Canal]].

The growing navies, and new ships driven by steam power, required coaling stations and ports for maintenance. Defense bases were also needed for the protection of sea routes and communication lines, particularly of expensive and vital international waterways such as the Suez Canal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\">H.R.

Colonies with large native populations were also a source of military power; Britain and France used large numbers of [[Sepoy#Sepoys in British India|British Indian]] and North African soldiers, respectively, in many of their colonial wars (and would do so again in the coming World Wars).

Following the 1904 ''[[Entente cordiale]]'' between France and the British Empire, Germany tried to isolate France in 1905 with the [[First Moroccan Crisis]]. This led to the 1905 [[Algeciras Conference]], in which France's influence on Morocco was compensated by the exchange of other territories, and then to the [[Agadir Crisis]] in 1911.

The [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895 was a failed attempt by the British South Africa Company and the [[Johannesburg Reform Committee]] to overthrow the Boer government in the Transvaal. The [[Second Boer War]], fought between 1899 and 1902, was about control of the gold and diamond industries; the independent Boer republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the South African Republic (or Transvaal) were this time defeated and absorbed into the British Empire.\n\nThe French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the coasts of [[West Africa]] (modern day [[Senegal]]) eastward, through the [[Sahel]] along the southern border of the Sahara, a huge desert covering most of present-day [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Chad]]. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted colonial empire from the [[Niger River]] to the Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the Caravan routes through the Sahara. The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in [[Southern Africa]] (modern South Africa, [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Zambia]]), with their territories in [[East Africa]] (modern [[Kenya]]), and these two areas with the Nile basin.\n\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ahmad]], leader of the Mahdists. This fundamentalist group of Muslim dervishes overran much of [[Sudan]] and [[Mahdist War|fought]] British forces.]]\n\nThe Sudan (which included most of present-day Uganda) was the key to the fulfillment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This \"red line\" through Africa is made most famous by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Along with [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], the British colonial minister in South Africa, Rhodes advocated such a \"Cape to Cairo\" empire, linking the Suez Canal to the mineral-rich Southern part of the continent by rail. Though hampered by German occupation of [[Tanganyika]] until the end of World War I, Rhodes successfully lobbied on behalf of such a sprawling African empire.\n\nIf one draws a line from [[Cape Town]] to [[Cairo]] (Rhodes's dream), and one from [[Dakar]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] (now [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]] and Somalia), (the French ambition), these two lines intersect somewhere in eastern Sudan near [[Fashoda]], explaining its strategic importance. In short, Britain had sought to extend its East African empire contiguously from Cairo to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], while France had sought to extend its own holdings from Dakar to the Sudan, which would enable its empire to span the entire continent from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Red Sea]].\n\nA French force under [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] arrived first at the strategically located fort at Fashoda, soon followed by a British force under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], commander in chief of the British Army since 1892. The French withdrew [[Fashoda Incident|after a standoff]] and continued to press claims to other posts in the region. In March 1899, the French and British agreed that the source of the Nile and [[Congo River]]s should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\n===Moroccan Crisis===\n{{Main|First Moroccan Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis}}\n\nAlthough the 1884\u201385 Berlin Conference had set the rules for the Scramble for Africa, it had not weakened the rival imperialists. The 1898 Fashoda Incident, which had seen France and the British Empire on the brink of war, ultimately led to the signature of the ''[[Entente cordiale|Entente Cordiale]]'' of 1904, which countered the influence of the European powers of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the new German Empire decided to test the solidity of such influence, using the contested territory of [[Morocco]] as a battlefield.\n\nThus, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited [[Tangiers]] on 31 March 1905 and made a speech in favor of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France's influence in Morocco had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The Kaiser's speech bolstered French nationalism, and with British support the French foreign minister, [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905, when Delcass\u00e9 was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation-minded premier [[Maurice Rouvier]]. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis. Both France and Germany continued to posture up until the conference, with Germany mobilizing reserve army units in late December and France actually moving troops to the border in January 1906.\n\n[[File:Si Kaddour ben Ghabrit et le sultan Moufay Hafid.jpg|thumb|left|The Moroccan [[Sultan]] [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], who led the resistance to French expansionism during the [[Agadir Crisis]]]]\n\nThe 1906 [[Algeciras Conference]] was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present, the German representatives found their only supporter was [[Austria-Hungary]]. France had firm support from Britain, the US, Russia, Italy and Spain. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on 31 May 1906, whereby France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.\n\nHowever, five years later the Second Moroccan Crisis (or [[Agadir Crisis]]) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat ''[[SMS Panther|Panther]]'' to the port of [[Agadir]] on 1 July 1911. Germany had started to attempt to surpass [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[History of the Royal Navy|naval supremacy]]&nbsp;\u2013 the British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two naval fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the ''Panther'''s arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic.\n\nThe German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the [[North Africa]]n kingdom, where France's pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference. In November 1911 a convention was signed under which Germany accepted France's position in Morocco in return for territory in the [[French Equatorial Africa]]n colony of [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]).\n\n[[French protectorate in Morocco|France]] and [[Spanish Protectorate in Morocco|Spain]] subsequently established a full [[protectorate]] over Morocco (30 March 1912), ending what remained of the country's formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the Entente between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would culminate in the First World War.\n\n===Dervish resistance===\n[[File:Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sayyid [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] (the \"Mad Mullah\"), leader of the [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]]]]\n\nFollowing the [[Berlin conference|Berlin Conference]] at the end of the 19th century, the [[British people|British]], [[Italian people|Italians]], and [[Ethiopia]]ns sought to claim lands owned by the Somalis such as the Warsangali Sultanate, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] and the [[Gobroon Dynasty]].\n\nThe [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish]] movement was a state established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a Somali religious leader who gathered Muslim soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands sought after by the Ethiopians and the European powers. The Dervish movement successfully repulsed the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region.<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'' (CRC Press, 2005), p. 1406.</ref> Due to these successful expeditions, the Dervish movement was recognised as an ally by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German Empire|German]] empires.

In both territories the threat to German rule was quickly defeated once large-scale reinforcements from Germany arrived, with the Herero rebels in German South-West Africa being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterberg]] and the Maji-Maji rebels in German East Africa being steadily crushed by German forces slowly advancing through the countryside, with the natives resorting to guerrilla warfare. German efforts to clear the bush of civilians in German South-West Africa then resulted in a [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|genocide of the population]].\n\nIn total, as many as 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Namaqua (50% of the total Namaqua population) either starved, died of thirst, or were worked to death in camps such as [[Shark Island Concentration Camp]] between 1904 and 1908. Characteristic of this genocide was death by starvation and the poisoning of the population's wells whilst they were trapped in the [[Namib Desert]].\n\n==Colonial encounter==\n\n===Colonial consciousness and exhibitions===\n\n====Colonial lobby====\n[[File:African Pigmies CNE-v1-p58-B.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pygmies]] and a European. Some pygmies would be exposed in [[human zoo]]s, such as [[Ota Benga]] displayed by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] in the [[Bronx Zoo]].]]\n\nIn its earlier stages, imperialism was generally the act of individual explorers as well as some adventurous merchantmen. The colonial powers were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensive adventures carried out abroad. Various important political leaders, such as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], opposed colonisation in its first years. However, during his second premiership between 1880 and 1885 he could not resist the colonial lobby in his cabinet, and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the [[class conflict|social tensions]] caused by the [[Long Depression]] pushed him to favor [[jingoism]]: the imperialists had become the \"parasites of [[patriotism]]\" ([[John A. Hobson]]).<ref>[[John A. Hobson]], ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'', 1902, p. 61 (quoted by Arendt).</ref> In [[French Third Republic|France]], then [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] politician [[Georges Clemenceau]] also adamantly opposed himself to it: he thought colonisation was a diversion from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]\" mountains, that is [[revanchism]] and the patriotic urge to reclaim the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region which had been annexed by the German Empire with the 1871 [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]]. Clemenceau actually made [[Jules Ferry]]'s cabinet fall after the 1885 [[Sino-French War|Tonkin disaster]]. According to [[Hannah Arendt]] in ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), this expansion of national sovereignty on overseas territories contradicted the unity of the [[nation state]] which provided citizenship to its population. Thus, a tension between the [[Moral universalism|universalist]] will to respect human rights of the colonised people, as they may be considered as \"citizens\" of the nation state, and the imperialist drive to cynically [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some, in colonising countries, opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration when left to itself; as described in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899)&nbsp;\u2013 published around the same time as [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[The White Man's Burden]]''&nbsp;\u2013 or in [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]'s ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'' (1932).\n\nColonial lobbies emerged to legitimise the Scramble for Africa and other expensive overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, the middle class often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market's growth. Even in lesser powers, voices like [[Enrico Corradini]] claimed a \"place in the sun\" for so-called \"proletarian nations\", bolstering [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]] in an early prototype of [[fascism]].\n\n====Colonial propaganda and jingoism====\n\n=====Colonial exhibitions=====\n[[File:Dellepiane-exposition-nationale-coloniale-1906.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1906 [[Colonial Exhibition]] in [[Marseilles]] (France)]]\nHowever, by the end of World War I the colonial empires had become very popular almost everywhere in Europe: [[public opinion]] had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although most of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. [[Colonial exhibition]]s were instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial propaganda, supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientists.<ref>Paul S. Landau, and Deborah D. Kaspin, eds. ''Images and empires: visuality in colonial and postcolonial Africa'' (U of California Press, 2002).</ref> Thus, conquests of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the [[indigenous people]] for scientific and leisure purposes. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a German merchant in wild animals and a future entrepreneur of most Europeans zoos, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoa]] and [[Sami people]] as \"purely natural\" populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. Presented in Paris, London, and Berlin these Nubians were very successful. Such \"[[human zoos]]\" could be found in Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York City, Paris, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. [[Tuaregs]] were exhibited after the French conquest of [[Timbuktu]] (visited by [[Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9]], disguised as a Muslim, in 1828, thereby winning the prize offered by the French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie''); [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] after the [[French Madagascar|occupation]] of [[Madagascar]]; [[Dahomey Amazons|Amazons]] of [[Abomey]] after [[Behanzin]]'s mediatic defeat against the French in 1894.

It was the central theme of the [[Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889\u201390]]. During the Scramble for Africa, an early but secondary focus of all [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. In French West Africa, following conquest and abolition by the French, over a million slaves fled from their masters to earlier homes between 1906 and 1911. In Madagascar, the French abolished slavery in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed. Slavery was abolished in the French controlled Sahel by 1911. Independent nations attempting to westernize or impress Europe sometimes cultivated an image of slavery suppression. In response to European pressure, the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] abolished slavery in 1900 and Ethiopia officially abolished slavery in 1932. Colonial powers were mostly successful in abolishing slavery, though slavery remained active in Africa even though it has gradually moved to a [[wage]] economy. Slavery was never fully eradicated in Africa.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). Encyclopedia of African history.

Large parts of the continent were essentially uninhabitable for Europeans because of the high mortality rates from diseases such as malaria.<ref>Thomas Pakenham, ''The Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912'' (1991) ch 1</ref> In the middle decades of the 19th century, European explorers had mapped  areas of [[East Africa]] and [[Central Africa]].\n\nEven as late as the 1870s, Western European states controlled only ten percent of the African continent, with all their territories located near the coast. The most important holdings were [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], held by Portugal; the [[Cape Colony]], held by the United Kingdom; and [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], held by [[France in the nineteenth century|France]].

Industrialisation brought about rapid advancements in transportation and communication, especially in the forms of steamships, railways and telegraphs. Medical advances also played an important role, especially medicines for [[tropical disease]]s. The development of [[quinine]], an effective treatment for [[malaria]], made vast expanses of the tropics more accessible for Europeans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/quinine|title=Quinine|website=broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n\n===Africa and global markets===\n\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\n\n[[Sub-Saharan Africa]], one of the last regions of the world largely untouched by \"informal imperialism\", was also attractive to Europe's ruling elites for economic, political and social reasons. During a time when Britain's [[balance of trade]] showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly [[protectionism|protectionist]] continental markets due to the [[Long Depression]] (1873\u201396), Africa offered [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and other countries an open market that would garner them a [[trade surplus]]: a market that bought more from the colonial power than it sold overall.<ref name=\"Shillington\" /><ref>Ewout Frankema, Jeffrey Williamson, and Pieter Woltjer, \"An Economic Rationale for the West African Scramble? The Commercial Transition and the Commodity Price Boom of 1835\u20131885,\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 78#1 (2018) , pp. 231\u201367.</ref>\n\nSurplus capital was often more profitably invested overseas, where cheap materials, limited competition, and abundant raw materials made a greater premium possible. Another inducement for imperialism arose from the demand for raw materials, especially [[copper]], cotton, rubber, [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], diamonds, tea, and [[tin]], to which European consumers had grown accustomed and upon which European industry had grown dependent. Additionally, Britain wanted the southern and eastern coasts of Africa for stopover ports on the route to Asia and its empire in India.<ref>Lynn Hunt, ''The Making of the West'': volume C, Bedford: St. Martin, 2009.</ref> However, in Africa \u2013 excluding the area which became the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 \u2013 the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small, compared to other continents. Consequently, the companies involved in tropical African commerce were relatively small, apart from [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[De Beers Mining Company]]. Rhodes had carved out [[Rhodesia]] for himself; [[Leopold II of Belgium]] later, and with considerable brutality, exploited the [[Congo Free State]].\n\nThese events might detract from the pro-imperialist arguments of colonial lobbyists such as the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'', [[Francesco Crispi]] and [[Jules Ferry]], who argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and [[overproduction]] caused by shrinking continental markets. [[John A. Hobson]] argued in ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'' that this shrinking of continental markets was a key factor of the global \"New Imperialism\" period.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Imperialism|last=Hobson|first=John Atkinson|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-79207-6|location=Cambridge|pages=77|oclc=889962491}}</ref> [[William Easterly]], however, disagrees with the link made between [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]], arguing that [[colonialism]] is used mostly to promote state-led development rather than \"corporate\" development.

The vast interior between [[Egypt]] and the gold and diamond-rich [[southern Africa]] had strategic value in securing the flow of overseas trade. Britain was under political pressure to secure lucrative markets against encroaching rivals in [[Qing|China]] and its eastern colonies, particularly [[British India|India]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Thus, it was crucial to secure the key waterway between East and West&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Suez Canal]].

The growing navies, and new ships driven by steam power, required coaling stations and ports for maintenance. Defense bases were also needed for the protection of sea routes and communication lines, particularly of expensive and vital international waterways such as the Suez Canal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\">H.R.

Colonies with large native populations were also a source of military power; Britain and France used large numbers of [[Sepoy#Sepoys in British India|British Indian]] and North African soldiers, respectively, in many of their colonial wars (and would do so again in the coming World Wars).

Nearly all of its overall empire of 2.6 million square kilometres and 14 million colonial subjects in 1914 was found in its African possessions of Southwest Africa, Togoland, the Cameroons, and Tanganyika. Following the 1904 ''[[Entente cordiale]]'' between France and the British Empire, Germany tried to isolate France in 1905 with the [[First Moroccan Crisis]]. This led to the 1905 [[Algeciras Conference]], in which France's influence on Morocco was compensated by the exchange of other territories, and then to the [[Agadir Crisis]] in 1911.

The [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895 was a failed attempt by the British South Africa Company and the [[Johannesburg Reform Committee]] to overthrow the Boer government in the Transvaal. The [[Second Boer War]], fought between 1899 and 1902, was about control of the gold and diamond industries; the independent Boer republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the South African Republic (or Transvaal) were this time defeated and absorbed into the British Empire.\n\nThe French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the coasts of [[West Africa]] (modern day [[Senegal]]) eastward, through the [[Sahel]] along the southern border of the Sahara, a huge desert covering most of present-day [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Chad]]. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted colonial empire from the [[Niger River]] to the Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the Caravan routes through the Sahara. The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in [[Southern Africa]] (modern South Africa, [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Zambia]]), with their territories in [[East Africa]] (modern [[Kenya]]), and these two areas with the Nile basin.\n\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ahmad]], leader of the Mahdists. This fundamentalist group of Muslim dervishes overran much of [[Sudan]] and [[Mahdist War|fought]] British forces.]]\n\nThe Sudan (which included most of present-day Uganda) was the key to the fulfillment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This \"red line\" through Africa is made most famous by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Along with [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], the British colonial minister in South Africa, Rhodes advocated such a \"Cape to Cairo\" empire, linking the Suez Canal to the mineral-rich Southern part of the continent by rail. Though hampered by German occupation of [[Tanganyika]] until the end of World War I, Rhodes successfully lobbied on behalf of such a sprawling African empire.\n\nIf one draws a line from [[Cape Town]] to [[Cairo]] (Rhodes's dream), and one from [[Dakar]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] (now [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]] and Somalia), (the French ambition), these two lines intersect somewhere in eastern Sudan near [[Fashoda]], explaining its strategic importance. In short, Britain had sought to extend its East African empire contiguously from Cairo to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], while France had sought to extend its own holdings from Dakar to the Sudan, which would enable its empire to span the entire continent from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Red Sea]].\n\nA French force under [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] arrived first at the strategically located fort at Fashoda, soon followed by a British force under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], commander in chief of the British Army since 1892. The French withdrew [[Fashoda Incident|after a standoff]] and continued to press claims to other posts in the region. In March 1899, the French and British agreed that the source of the Nile and [[Congo River]]s should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\n===Moroccan Crisis===\n{{Main|First Moroccan Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis}}\n\nAlthough the 1884\u201385 Berlin Conference had set the rules for the Scramble for Africa, it had not weakened the rival imperialists. The 1898 Fashoda Incident, which had seen France and the British Empire on the brink of war, ultimately led to the signature of the ''[[Entente cordiale|Entente Cordiale]]'' of 1904, which countered the influence of the European powers of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the new German Empire decided to test the solidity of such influence, using the contested territory of [[Morocco]] as a battlefield.\n\nThus, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited [[Tangiers]] on 31 March 1905 and made a speech in favor of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France's influence in Morocco had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The Kaiser's speech bolstered French nationalism, and with British support the French foreign minister, [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905, when Delcass\u00e9 was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation-minded premier [[Maurice Rouvier]]. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis. Both France and Germany continued to posture up until the conference, with Germany mobilizing reserve army units in late December and France actually moving troops to the border in January 1906.\n\n[[File:Si Kaddour ben Ghabrit et le sultan Moufay Hafid.jpg|thumb|left|The Moroccan [[Sultan]] [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], who led the resistance to French expansionism during the [[Agadir Crisis]]]]\n\nThe 1906 [[Algeciras Conference]] was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present, the German representatives found their only supporter was [[Austria-Hungary]]. France had firm support from Britain, the US, Russia, Italy and Spain. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on 31 May 1906, whereby France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.\n\nHowever, five years later the Second Moroccan Crisis (or [[Agadir Crisis]]) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat ''[[SMS Panther|Panther]]'' to the port of [[Agadir]] on 1 July 1911. Germany had started to attempt to surpass [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[History of the Royal Navy|naval supremacy]]&nbsp;\u2013 the British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two naval fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the ''Panther'''s arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic.\n\nThe German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the [[North Africa]]n kingdom, where France's pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference. In November 1911 a convention was signed under which Germany accepted France's position in Morocco in return for territory in the [[French Equatorial Africa]]n colony of [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]).\n\n[[French protectorate in Morocco|France]] and [[Spanish Protectorate in Morocco|Spain]] subsequently established a full [[protectorate]] over Morocco (30 March 1912), ending what remained of the country's formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the Entente between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would culminate in the First World War.\n\n===Dervish resistance===\n[[File:Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sayyid [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] (the \"Mad Mullah\"), leader of the [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]]]]\n\nFollowing the [[Berlin conference|Berlin Conference]] at the end of the 19th century, the [[British people|British]], [[Italian people|Italians]], and [[Ethiopia]]ns sought to claim lands owned by the Somalis such as the Warsangali Sultanate, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] and the [[Gobroon Dynasty]].\n\nThe [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish]] movement was a state established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a Somali religious leader who gathered Muslim soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands sought after by the Ethiopians and the European powers.

In both territories the threat to German rule was quickly defeated once large-scale reinforcements from Germany arrived, with the Herero rebels in German South-West Africa being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterberg]] and the Maji-Maji rebels in German East Africa being steadily crushed by German forces slowly advancing through the countryside, with the natives resorting to guerrilla warfare. German efforts to clear the bush of civilians in German South-West Africa then resulted in a [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|genocide of the population]].\n\nIn total, as many as 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Namaqua (50% of the total Namaqua population) either starved, died of thirst, or were worked to death in camps such as [[Shark Island Concentration Camp]] between 1904 and 1908. Characteristic of this genocide was death by starvation and the poisoning of the population's wells whilst they were trapped in the [[Namib Desert]].\n\n==Colonial encounter==\n\n===Colonial consciousness and exhibitions===\n\n====Colonial lobby====\n[[File:African Pigmies CNE-v1-p58-B.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pygmies]] and a European. Some pygmies would be exposed in [[human zoo]]s, such as [[Ota Benga]] displayed by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] in the [[Bronx Zoo]].]]\n\nIn its earlier stages, imperialism was generally the act of individual explorers as well as some adventurous merchantmen. The colonial powers were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensive adventures carried out abroad. Various important political leaders, such as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], opposed colonisation in its first years. However, during his second premiership between 1880 and 1885 he could not resist the colonial lobby in his cabinet, and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the [[class conflict|social tensions]] caused by the [[Long Depression]] pushed him to favor [[jingoism]]: the imperialists had become the \"parasites of [[patriotism]]\" ([[John A. Hobson]]).<ref>[[John A. Hobson]], ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'', 1902, p. 61 (quoted by Arendt).</ref> In [[French Third Republic|France]], then [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] politician [[Georges Clemenceau]] also adamantly opposed himself to it: he thought colonisation was a diversion from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]\" mountains, that is [[revanchism]] and the patriotic urge to reclaim the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region which had been annexed by the German Empire with the 1871 [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]]. Clemenceau actually made [[Jules Ferry]]'s cabinet fall after the 1885 [[Sino-French War|Tonkin disaster]]. According to [[Hannah Arendt]] in ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), this expansion of national sovereignty on overseas territories contradicted the unity of the [[nation state]] which provided citizenship to its population. Thus, a tension between the [[Moral universalism|universalist]] will to respect human rights of the colonised people, as they may be considered as \"citizens\" of the nation state, and the imperialist drive to cynically [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some, in colonising countries, opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration when left to itself; as described in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899)&nbsp;\u2013 published around the same time as [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[The White Man's Burden]]''&nbsp;\u2013 or in [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]'s ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'' (1932).\n\nColonial lobbies emerged to legitimise the Scramble for Africa and other expensive overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, the middle class often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market's growth. Even in lesser powers, voices like [[Enrico Corradini]] claimed a \"place in the sun\" for so-called \"proletarian nations\", bolstering [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]] in an early prototype of [[fascism]].\n\n====Colonial propaganda and jingoism====\n\n=====Colonial exhibitions=====\n[[File:Dellepiane-exposition-nationale-coloniale-1906.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1906 [[Colonial Exhibition]] in [[Marseilles]] (France)]]\nHowever, by the end of World War I the colonial empires had become very popular almost everywhere in Europe: [[public opinion]] had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although most of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. [[Colonial exhibition]]s were instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial propaganda, supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientists.<ref>Paul S. Landau, and Deborah D. Kaspin, eds. ''Images and empires: visuality in colonial and postcolonial Africa'' (U of California Press, 2002).</ref> Thus, conquests of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the [[indigenous people]] for scientific and leisure purposes. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a German merchant in wild animals and a future entrepreneur of most Europeans zoos, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoa]] and [[Sami people]] as \"purely natural\" populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. Presented in Paris, London, and Berlin these Nubians were very successful. Such \"[[human zoos]]\" could be found in Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York City, Paris, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. [[Tuaregs]] were exhibited after the French conquest of [[Timbuktu]] (visited by [[Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9]], disguised as a Muslim, in 1828, thereby winning the prize offered by the French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie''); [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] after the [[French Madagascar|occupation]] of [[Madagascar]]; [[Dahomey Amazons|Amazons]] of [[Abomey]] after [[Behanzin]]'s mediatic defeat against the French in 1894.

It was the central theme of the [[Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889\u201390]]. During the Scramble for Africa, an early but secondary focus of all [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. In French West Africa, following conquest and abolition by the French, over a million slaves fled from their masters to earlier homes between 1906 and 1911. In Madagascar, the French abolished slavery in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed. Slavery was abolished in the French controlled Sahel by 1911. Independent nations attempting to westernize or impress Europe sometimes cultivated an image of slavery suppression. In response to European pressure, the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] abolished slavery in 1900 and Ethiopia officially abolished slavery in 1932. Colonial powers were mostly successful in abolishing slavery, though slavery remained active in Africa even though it has gradually moved to a [[wage]] economy. Slavery was never fully eradicated in Africa.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). Encyclopedia of African history.

The film was both a box office and critical success, grossing $254 million worldwide. It earned seven [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]].\n\nIn 1998, a sequel directed by Miller, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'', was released.\n\n==Plot==\nBabe, an orphaned piglet, is chosen for a \"guess the weight\" contest at a [[county fair]]. The winning farmer, Arthur Hoggett, brings him home and allows him to stay with a [[Border Collie]] named Fly, her mate Rex and their puppies, in the barn.\n\nA duck named Ferdinand, who crows as roosters are said to every morning to wake people so he will be considered useful and be spared from being eaten, persuades Babe to help him destroy the alarm clock that threatens his mission. Despite succeeding in this, they wake Duchess, the Hoggetts' cat, and in the confusion accidentally destroy the living room. At the barn meeting, Rex sternly instructs Babe to stay away from Ferdinand (now a fugitive) and the house. Sometime later, when Fly's puppies are put up for sale, Babe asks if he can call her \"Mom\".\n\nChristmas brings a visit from the Hoggetts' relatives. Babe is almost chosen for [[Christmas dinner]], but a duck is picked instead after Hoggett remarks to his wife Esme that Babe may bring a prize for ham at the next county fair. On Christmas Day, Babe justifies his existence by alerting Hoggett to sheep rustlers stealing sheep from one of the fields. The next day, Hoggett sees Babe sort the hens, separating the brown from the white ones. Impressed, he takes him to the fields and allows him to try to herd the sheep. Encouraged by an elder ewe named Maa, the sheep cooperate, but Rex sees Babe's actions as an insult to sheepdogs and confronts Fly in a vicious fight for encouraging Babe. He injures her leg and accidentally bites Hoggett's hand when Hoggett tries to intervene. Rex is then chained to the dog house, muzzled and sedated, leaving the sheep herding job to Babe.\n\nOne morning, Babe is awakened by the sheep's cries and finds three dogs attacking them. Although he manages to scare them off, Maa is mortally injured and dies as a result. Hoggett arrives and, thinking that Babe killed her, prepares to shoot him. Fly is so anxious to find out whether he is guilty or innocent that, instead of barking orders at the sheep, she talks to them to find out what happened. Learning the truth, Fly barks to distract Hoggett; delayed until Esme mentions that the police say [[feral dogs]] have been killing sheep on neighboring farms and asks Hoggett why he has taken his shotgun out, he then unloads it.\n\nWhen Esme leaves on a trip, Hoggett signs Babe up for a local sheepherding competition. As it is raining the night before, Hoggett lets him and Fly into the house. However, Duchess scratches him when he tries to speak to her, so Hoggett immediately confines her outside. When she is let back in later, she gets revenge on Babe by revealing that humans eat pigs. Horrified, he runs out to the barn and learns from Fly that this is true. The next morning, Fly discovers that Babe has run away. She and Rex alert Hoggett and they all search for him. Rex finds him in a cemetery and Hoggett brings him home. However, he is still demoralized and refuses to eat. Hoggett gives him a drink from a baby bottle, sings to him \"[[If I Had Words]]\" and dances a [[jig]] for him. This restores Babe's faith in Hoggett's affection and he begins eating again.\n\nAt the competition, Babe meets the sheep that he will be herding, but they ignore his attempts to speak to them. As Hoggett is criticized by the bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a dog, Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do. They give him a secret password, first extracting a promise that he will treat them better from now on. He returns in time to convey the password to Babe, and the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly. Amid the crowd's acclamation, he is unanimously given a perfect score. While he sits down next to the farmer, Hoggett praises him with the standard command to sheep dogs that their job is done, \"That'll do, Pig. That'll do.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Arthur Hoggett\n* [[Magda Szubanski]] as Esme Cordelia Hoggett\n* [[Brittany Byrnes]] as The Hoggetts' granddaughter\n* Wade Hayward as The Hoggetts' grandson\n* [[Paul Goddard (actor)|Paul Goddard]] as the Hoggetts' son-in-law\n* Zoe Burton as the Hoggetts' daughter\n\n===Voices===\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as the Narrator\n* [[Christine Cavanaugh]] as Babe\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Fly, a female [[Border Collie]]\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as Rex, the lead sheepdog\n* [[Danny Mann]] as Ferdinand, a white [[Indian Runner duck]]\n* [[Miriam Flynn]] as Maa, an old [[Sheep|ewe]] on Hoggett Farm\n* [[Russi Taylor]] as Duchess, the Hoggetts' [[cat]]\n* Michael Edward-Stevens as The Horse\n* Charles Bartlett as The Cow\n* Evelyn Krape as Old Ewe\n* [[Paul Livingston]] as Rooster\n* [[John Erwin]] as a TV Commentator\n* [[Doris Grau]] as Country Woman\n\nFly's puppies voiced by [[Ross Bagley]], Gemini Barnett, Rachel Davey, [[Debi Derryberry]], [[Courtland Mead]], [[Jazz Raycole]], and Kevin Jamal Woods\n\nSheep voiced by Jane Alden, Kimberly Bailey, Patrika Darbo, Michelle Davison, Julie Forsyth, Maeve Germaine, Rosanna Huffman, Carlyle King, Tina Lifford, Gennie Nevinson, Mary Linda Phillips, Paige Pollack, and [[Kerry Walker]]\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=November 2018}}\n48 different pigs were used for the part of Babe.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=Data Stream|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|page=28}}</ref>\n\nAccording to actor James Cromwell, there was tension on the set between producer George Miller and director Chris Noonan.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Tasha |title=Interview: James Cromwell|url=https://film.avclub.com/james-cromwell-1798229824|website=AV Film|accessdate=December 31, 2017|date=February 8, 2012}}</ref> Noonan later complained, \"I don't want to make a lifelong enemy of George Miller but I thought that he tried to take credit for ''Babe'', tried to exclude me from any credit, and it made me very insecure...

As it is raining the night before, Hoggett lets him and Fly into the house. However, Duchess scratches him when he tries to speak to her, so Hoggett immediately confines her outside. When she is let back in later, she gets revenge on Babe by revealing that humans eat pigs. Horrified, he runs out to the barn and learns from Fly that this is true. The next morning, Fly discovers that Babe has run away. She and Rex alert Hoggett and they all search for him. Rex finds him in a cemetery and Hoggett brings him home. However, he is still demoralized and refuses to eat. Hoggett gives him a drink from a baby bottle, sings to him \"[[If I Had Words]]\" and dances a [[jig]] for him. This restores Babe's faith in Hoggett's affection and he begins eating again.\n\nAt the competition, Babe meets the sheep that he will be herding, but they ignore his attempts to speak to them. As Hoggett is criticized by the bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a dog, Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do. They give him a secret password, first extracting a promise that he will treat them better from now on. He returns in time to convey the password to Babe, and the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly. Amid the crowd's acclamation, he is unanimously given a perfect score. While he sits down next to the farmer, Hoggett praises him with the standard command to sheep dogs that their job is done, \"That'll do, Pig. That'll do.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Arthur Hoggett\n* [[Magda Szubanski]] as Esme Cordelia Hoggett\n* [[Brittany Byrnes]] as The Hoggetts' granddaughter\n* Wade Hayward as The Hoggetts' grandson\n* [[Paul Goddard (actor)|Paul Goddard]] as the Hoggetts' son-in-law\n* Zoe Burton as the Hoggetts' daughter\n\n===Voices===\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as the Narrator\n* [[Christine Cavanaugh]] as Babe\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Fly, a female [[Border Collie]]\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as Rex, the lead sheepdog\n* [[Danny Mann]] as Ferdinand, a white [[Indian Runner duck]]\n* [[Miriam Flynn]] as Maa, an old [[Sheep|ewe]] on Hoggett Farm\n* [[Russi Taylor]] as Duchess, the Hoggetts' [[cat]]\n* Michael Edward-Stevens as The Horse\n* Charles Bartlett as The Cow\n* Evelyn Krape as Old Ewe\n* [[Paul Livingston]] as Rooster\n* [[John Erwin]] as a TV Commentator\n* [[Doris Grau]] as Country Woman\n\nFly's puppies voiced by [[Ross Bagley]], Gemini Barnett, Rachel Davey, [[Debi Derryberry]], [[Courtland Mead]], [[Jazz Raycole]], and Kevin Jamal Woods\n\nSheep voiced by Jane Alden, Kimberly Bailey, Patrika Darbo, Michelle Davison, Julie Forsyth, Maeve Germaine, Rosanna Huffman, Carlyle King, Tina Lifford, Gennie Nevinson, Mary Linda Phillips, Paige Pollack, and [[Kerry Walker]]\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=November 2018}}\n48 different pigs were used for the part of Babe.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=Data Stream|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|page=28}}</ref>\n\nAccording to actor James Cromwell, there was tension on the set between producer George Miller and director Chris Noonan.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Tasha |title=Interview: James Cromwell|url=https://film.avclub.com/james-cromwell-1798229824|website=AV Film|accessdate=December 31, 2017|date=February 8, 2012}}</ref> Noonan later complained, \"I don't want to make a lifelong enemy of George Miller but I thought that he tried to take credit for ''Babe'', tried to exclude me from any credit, and it made me very insecure...

He asked for advice from nearby campers, and they suggested the spring that oozed from the bank of the [[Fishing River]]. Water was collected and brought to his daughter to drink. Over the course of a few weeks, there was noticeable improvement to her health, and she was eventually cured. A log-cabin farmer, Frederick Kugler, also begin to treat his [[rheumatism|rheumatic]] knees and a recurring sore from a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] wound, and he was cured of his ailments shortly after.\n\nRev. John Van Buren Flack traveled here in 1880 after hearing about the medicinal values of the spring water. The spring belonged to land owner Anthony W. Wyman. After Flack investigated the water sources, he advised Wyman to have the land [[plat]]ted, water analyzed, and to begin advertising the cures the water held. Flack built a home on a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} tract that Wyman had platted and opened the town's first dry goods store as well as the first church. The spring was named \"Excelsior\", which later changed to [[Siloam]].\n\nOn August 17, 1880, Flack and Wyman partnered together to form the community of Excelsior. The post office at the time denied the original town name of \"Excelsior\", as there was already a town in southern Missouri with that name, therefore the town was named originally Vigniti. The city kept the name until 1882, when it was renamed Excelsior Springs.\n\nWithin one year, nearly two hundred households had built in the valley and the nearby hillsides. The springs proved successful and brought many new people to the area, who camped out in tents or in covered wagons. On February 7, 1881, the town received the designation of [[Village (United States)|village]]. On July 12, 1881, the community was incorporated as a fourth class city, bringing several hotels, boarding houses, churches, schools, an opera house, livery stables, and stores.\n\nIn 1881, a second mineral spring was found by Captain J.L. Farris, first called Empire Spring but later known as Regent Spring. Yet a third spring, Relief Spring, was discovered at the basin in the Fishing River. In a short span of time, many springs were discovered in the area, the most prominent being the Relief, Superior, and Saratoga springs. A pump was installed at the Siloam Spring, and steps from Broadway Street and the city's first hotel, the Excelsior, were constructed. Soon a small wooden bridge was built over the Fishing River to an undeveloped peninsula used for visitors to relax while exploring the spring. No city in Missouri had boomed as much as Excelsior Springs had in the first year of existence.\n[[File:1890s.FirstElmsHotel.jpg|thumb|The original Elms Hotel]]\nThe city's first hotel, the Excelsior, was built with a foundation of {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|70|ft|m}}, and locals wondered if a hotel that size would ever be filled to capacity. The Excelsior opened its doors for business on March 1, 1881, and quickly proved that it could be filled, with many visitors coming to the small town seeking out the medicinal value to the waters held, many from as far away as [[St. Louis]], [[Saint Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]]. The hotel remained the leading place to stay until the first [[Elms Hotel (Excelsior Springs, Missouri)|Elms Hotel]] was built and opened in 1888.\n[[File:Iowa, Chicago & Eastern - City Of Excelsior Springs.jpg|thumb|Iowa, Chicago & Eastern Railroad's locomotive #6414 (engine labeled \"City Of Excelsior Springs\").]] \nIn 1887, the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad]] extended its line from [[Chicago]] to Kansas City via Excelsior Springs. This brought a larger influx of visitors to the growing city. By this time the Relief Springs and Land Company had been formed primarily to advertise and pique the interest of outsiders. The company acquired {{convert|1000|acre|sqkm}} of land surrounding the city and the Fishing River. The historic Elms Hotel's foundation was soon poured. The Music Hall, a state-of-the-art theater for the time, was built nearby with a [[seating capacity]] of 1,320 people. An amusement pavilion was erected but was soon changed into a bottling works facility. A larger pavilion with benches and hooks for cups was placed at Siloam Spring where visitors could partake in the water; soon these mugs became stained due to the high [[iron]] content of the water. Partnered with the Milwaukee Railroad, the city began to advertise their resort status nationwide. In 1897, the city received its first telephone service.\n\nDiscovery of new waters continued around the area. Internationally renowned professor Dr. W.P. Mason of the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] analyzed the waters. His finding reported the Siloam and Regent spring waters to have [[bicarbonate]]s of iron and [[manganese]], a rare combination that had only been found in four springs in the entire continent of Europe, and Excelsior Springs held the only two known in the United States. The rarity of having 20 separate mineral springs within the area gave Excelsior Springs the reputation of having the world's greatest collection of mineral waters.\n\nOther minerals found in the springs were Saline-[[Sulphur]], [[sodium bicarbonate|Soda-Bicarbonate]], and [[calcium bicarbonate|Calcic-Bicarbonate]] (also known as [[Lithia water|Lithia]]). Mineral water resorts of the time rarely held such variety, most only mineral water baths, but Excelsior Springs held four distinct types of treatment within the region of tonic, alternative, and eliminative treatments, along with the mineral water baths. The city received international attention in 1893 at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago's World Fair]] when medals were awarded for the [[iron]]-[[manganese]] water from the Regent Spring and Soterian [[ginger ale]].\n\nOctober 1893 brought more train service to the city with the opening of the Sulpho-Saline route connecting to the [[Wabash Railroad|Wabash]] line. Fires destroyed the Excelsior Hotel and the Elms Hotel, leaving only boarding houses to take in visitors. Plans were soon drawn up for the rebuilding of the Elms Hotel. The \"Second\" Elms Hotel was finished in 1908, but was soon destroyed again by fire. The third and present-day Elms Hotel was constructed in 1912. Also built were the Wholf's Tavern (later renamed Royal Hotel) and Snapp Hotel (later renamed Oaks Hotel). By 1909, the growing city boasted 14 modern hotels and about 200 boarding and rooming houses.\n\nThe development of a park system was approved as well, costing $200,000 at the time. This brought the Excelsior Springs [[Golf Course]] and the construction of many structures including the [[Freemasonry|Masonic Hall]], auditorium, [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows]] Building, and Morse buildings. Hourly transportation on the Kansas City interurban railroad began in January 1912. The expansion of public utilities and a system of highways connecting Excelsior Springs and Kansas City helped the city thrive.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] did not have the impact on Excelsior Springs as it had on several other communities, surviving mostly due to its health resort status.  Between 1930 and 1940, the town gained 370 citizens, reporting 4,800 total at the end of the decade, when populations in most other small towns were declining.\n\nIn November 1931, one of the most intense gun battles happened at the historic Elms Hotel. Four robbers attempted to hold up the hotel and managed to flee by automobile, which were followed by local law enforcement. Gunshots were exchanged in the hotel lobby and veranda. The four criminals fled to nearby Kansas City, but were later apprehended.\n\nIn 1932, [[American Mafia|Mafia]] gangster Lonnie Affronti shot Azalea Ross and her husband in an ambush shoot-out on [[Missouri Route 10|Route 10]]. Ross was the chief witness in a [[narcotic]]s trial against Affronti.  The gangland aided in hiding Affronti for five years before he was captured in [[Brooklyn, New York]], in 1937.  One of his accomplices during the shoot-out, Charley Harvey, was apprehended and killed himself in the city jail a short time later.\n[[File:Hall of Waters Missouri.jpg|thumb|Excelsior Springs, Missouri City Hall, commonly known as The Hall of Waters.]]\n\nThe present [[city hall]], the [[Hall of Waters]], was constructed between 1936 and 1938 by architects Keene & Simpson above the Siloam and Sulpho-Saline Springs. Citizens gathered on May 27, 1936, amongst national attention when the cornerstone of the Hall of Waters was lowered in place.  [[CBS]] transmitted the event to 62 stations across the country.  The local newspaper recorded many well-known names of the present time, including [[Hollywood]] [[B movie|B-movie]] [[actress]] [[Evalyn Knapp]], artist [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and author [[Homer Croy]].\n\nIn 1937 the structure was partially complete, and the water bar in the lower level opened, providing mineral waters to health-seekers and visitors alike. In the following months the mineral water pool was opened, along with male and female [[hydrotherapy]] departments. A two-story hall had also been erected where the minerals were made available at fountains. The first floor contained the women's bath department, [[sunroom]], covered porch, grand [[foyer]], management office for the springs, and the [[chamber of commerce]].\n\nThe swimming pool was large enough to met standards for championship meets. In the south wing were the special hydrotherapy departments devoted to research for the waters' medicinal values. The bottling department was located on the east side of the north wing, which shipped five varieties of bottled mineral water to locations all over the world.\n\nOn Election Day 1948, [[Harry S. Truman]] spent the night at the Elms Hotel when it appeared that he was losing his re-election bid to Republican [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. However, in the wee hours of the morning, he was awakened by his aides informing him that he had, in fact, won the election.  He was whisked away to Kansas City. He later was photographed at Union Station in St. Louis holding a copy of the ''Chicago Tribune'' that famously proclaimed \"[[Dewey Defeats Truman]].\"\n\n[[Flood]]ing caused issues in 1955, and a [[levee|dike]] was constructed, which resulted in the elimination of the stone terraces and walkways at Siloam Park, to protect the Hall of Waters from further flood damage by the nearby Fishing River. There were subsequent floods in the late 1960s, 1993,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.excelsiorspringsstandard.com/news/local/readers-remember-flood-of/article_76b60fc3-097f-59a3-b2cb-450c79593fde.html|title=Readers remember Flood of \u201993|newspaper=Excelsior Springs Standard|accessdate=23 May 2019}}</ref> and 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fox4kc.com/2015/06/03/residents-of-excelsior-springs-say-flooding-is-the-worst-theyve-seen-in-20-years/|title=Residents of Excelsior Springs say flooding is the worst they\u2019ve seen in 20 years|date=3 June 2015|website=Fox4kc.com|accessdate=23 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe late 1950s and early 1960s proved difficult times for the city due to the severe decline in popularity of the resort spa town. By 1967, the bottling operations had lost $25,000, and the city decided it was time to put their mineral water history behind them and move forward to new horizons. {{As of|2008}}, however, Excelsior Springs has licensed the rights to the mineral water to Excelsior Springs Bottling Company to allow for commercial bottling and distribution of the historic water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.excelsiorspringsstandard.com/archives/10-31-08.html |title=Excelsior Springs Standard Archive |website=Excelsiorspringsstandard.com |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esbottling.com |title=Excelsior Springs Bottling Company - Home |website=Esbottling.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Elms Hotel and Hall of Waters, the [[Colonial Hotel (Excelsior Springs, Missouri)|Colonial Hotel]], [[The Elms Historic District]], [[Excelsior Springs Hall of Waters Commercial East Historic District]], [[Excelsior Springs Hall of Waters Commercial West Historic District]], [[First Methodist Church (Excelsior Springs, Missouri)|First Methodist Church]], [[Ligon Apartments]], [[Watkins Woolen Mill State Park and State Historic Site|Watkins Mill]], and [[Wyman School]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref><ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/listings/20140411.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2011-05-06|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 3/31/14 through 4/05/14 |publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nExcelsior Springs sports a quaint historic downtown district, which is currently undergoing renewed development.

He asked for advice from nearby campers, and they suggested the spring that oozed from the bank of the [[Fishing River]]. Water was collected and brought to his daughter to drink. Over the course of a few weeks, there was noticeable improvement to her health, and she was eventually cured. A log-cabin farmer, Frederick Kugler, also begin to treat his [[rheumatism|rheumatic]] knees and a recurring sore from a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] wound, and he was cured of his ailments shortly after.\n\nRev. John Van Buren Flack traveled here in 1880 after hearing about the medicinal values of the spring water. The spring belonged to land owner Anthony W. Wyman. After Flack investigated the water sources, he advised Wyman to have the land [[plat]]ted, water analyzed, and to begin advertising the cures the water held. Flack built a home on a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} tract that Wyman had platted and opened the town's first dry goods store as well as the first church. The spring was named \"Excelsior\", which later changed to [[Siloam]].\n\nOn August 17, 1880, Flack and Wyman partnered together to form the community of Excelsior. The post office at the time denied the original town name of \"Excelsior\", as there was already a town in southern Missouri with that name, therefore the town was named originally Vigniti. The city kept the name until 1882, when it was renamed Excelsior Springs.\n\nWithin one year, nearly two hundred households had built in the valley and the nearby hillsides. The springs proved successful and brought many new people to the area, who camped out in tents or in covered wagons. On February 7, 1881, the town received the designation of [[Village (United States)|village]]. On July 12, 1881, the community was incorporated as a fourth class city, bringing several hotels, boarding houses, churches, schools, an opera house, livery stables, and stores.\n\nIn 1881, a second mineral spring was found by Captain J.L. Farris, first called Empire Spring but later known as Regent Spring. Yet a third spring, Relief Spring, was discovered at the basin in the Fishing River. In a short span of time, many springs were discovered in the area, the most prominent being the Relief, Superior, and Saratoga springs. A pump was installed at the Siloam Spring, and steps from Broadway Street and the city's first hotel, the Excelsior, were constructed. Soon a small wooden bridge was built over the Fishing River to an undeveloped peninsula used for visitors to relax while exploring the spring. No city in Missouri had boomed as much as Excelsior Springs had in the first year of existence.\n[[File:1890s.FirstElmsHotel.jpg|thumb|left|The original Elms Hotel]]\nThe city's first hotel, the Excelsior, was built with a foundation of {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|70|ft|m}}, and locals wondered if a hotel that size would ever be filled to capacity. The Excelsior opened its doors for business on March 1, 1881, and quickly proved that it could be filled, with many visitors coming to the small town seeking out the medicinal value to the waters held, many from as far away as [[St. Louis]], [[Saint Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]]. The hotel remained the leading place to stay until the first [[Elms Hotel (Excelsior Springs, Missouri)|Elms Hotel]] was built and opened in 1888.\n[[File:Iowa, Chicago & Eastern - City Of Excelsior Springs.jpg|thumb|Iowa, Chicago & Eastern Railroad's locomotive #6414 (engine labeled \"City Of Excelsior Springs\").]] \nIn 1887, the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad]] extended its line from [[Chicago]] to Kansas City via Excelsior Springs. This brought a larger influx of visitors to the growing city. By this time the Relief Springs and Land Company had been formed primarily to advertise and pique the interest of outsiders. The company acquired {{convert|1000|acre|sqkm}} of land surrounding the city and the Fishing River. The historic Elms Hotel's foundation was soon poured. The Music Hall, a state-of-the-art theater for the time, was built nearby with a [[seating capacity]] of 1,320 people. An amusement pavilion was erected but was soon changed into a bottling works facility. A larger pavilion with benches and hooks for cups was placed at Siloam Spring where visitors could partake in the water; soon these mugs became stained due to the high [[iron]] content of the water. Partnered with the Milwaukee Railroad, the city began to advertise their resort status nationwide. In 1897, the city received its first telephone service.\n\nDiscovery of new waters continued around the area. Internationally renowned professor Dr. W.P. Mason of the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] analyzed the waters. His finding reported the Siloam and Regent spring waters to have [[bicarbonate]]s of iron and [[manganese]], a rare combination that had only been found in four springs in the entire continent of Europe, and Excelsior Springs held the only two known in the United States. The rarity of having 20 separate mineral springs within the area gave Excelsior Springs the reputation of having the world's greatest collection of mineral waters.\n\nOther minerals found in the springs were Saline-[[Sulphur]], [[sodium bicarbonate|Soda-Bicarbonate]], and [[calcium bicarbonate|Calcic-Bicarbonate]] (also known as [[Lithia water|Lithia]]). Mineral water resorts of the time rarely held such variety, most only mineral water baths, but Excelsior Springs held four distinct types of treatment within the region of tonic, alternative, and eliminative treatments, along with the mineral water baths. The city received international attention in 1893 at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago's World Fair]] when medals were awarded for the [[iron]]-[[manganese]] water from the Regent Spring and Soterian [[ginger ale]].\n\nOctober 1893 brought more train service to the city with the opening of the Sulpho-Saline route connecting to the [[Wabash Railroad|Wabash]] line. Fires destroyed the Excelsior Hotel and the Elms Hotel, leaving only boarding houses to take in visitors. Plans were soon drawn up for the rebuilding of the Elms Hotel. The \"Second\" Elms Hotel was finished in 1908, but was soon destroyed again by fire. The third and present-day Elms Hotel was constructed in 1912. Also built were the Wholf's Tavern (later renamed Royal Hotel) and Snapp Hotel (later renamed Oaks Hotel). By 1909, the growing city boasted 14 modern hotels and about 200 boarding and rooming houses.\n\nThe development of a park system was approved as well, costing $200,000 at the time. This brought the Excelsior Springs [[Golf Course]] and the construction of many structures including the [[Freemasonry|Masonic Hall]], auditorium, [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows]] Building, and Morse buildings. Hourly transportation on the Kansas City interurban railroad began in January 1912. The expansion of public utilities and a system of highways connecting Excelsior Springs and Kansas City helped the city thrive.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] did not have the impact on Excelsior Springs as it had on several other communities, surviving mostly due to its health resort status.  Between 1930 and 1940, the town gained 370 citizens, reporting 4,800 total at the end of the decade, when populations in most other small towns were declining.\n\nIn November 1931, one of the most intense gun battles happened at the historic Elms Hotel. Four robbers attempted to hold up the hotel and managed to flee by automobile, which were followed by local law enforcement. Gunshots were exchanged in the hotel lobby and veranda. The four criminals fled to nearby Kansas City, but were later apprehended.\n\nIn 1932, [[American Mafia|Mafia]] gangster Lonnie Affronti shot Azalea Ross and her husband in an ambush shoot-out on [[Missouri Route 10|Route 10]]. Ross was the chief witness in a [[narcotic]]s trial against Affronti.  The gangland aided in hiding Affronti for five years before he was captured in [[Brooklyn, New York]], in 1937.  One of his accomplices during the shoot-out, Charley Harvey, was apprehended and killed himself in the city jail a short time later.\n[[File:Hall of Waters Missouri.jpg|thumb|left|Excelsior Springs, Missouri City Hall, commonly known as The Hall of Waters.]]\n\nThe present [[city hall]], the [[Hall of Waters]], was constructed between 1936 and 1938 by architects Keene & Simpson above the Siloam and Sulpho-Saline Springs. Citizens gathered on May 27, 1936, amongst national attention when the cornerstone of the Hall of Waters was lowered in place.  [[CBS]] transmitted the event to 62 stations across the country.  The local newspaper recorded many well-known names of the present time, including [[Hollywood]] [[B movie|B-movie]] [[actress]] [[Evalyn Knapp]], artist [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and author [[Homer Croy]].\n\nIn 1937 the structure was partially complete, and the water bar in the lower level opened, providing mineral waters to health-seekers and visitors alike. In the following months the mineral water pool was opened, along with male and female [[hydrotherapy]] departments. A two-story hall had also been erected where the minerals were made available at fountains. The first floor contained the women's bath department, [[sunroom]], covered porch, grand [[foyer]], management office for the springs, and the [[chamber of commerce]].\n\nThe swimming pool was large enough to met standards for championship meets. In the south wing were the special hydrotherapy departments devoted to research for the waters' medicinal values. The bottling department was located on the east side of the north wing, which shipped five varieties of bottled mineral water to locations all over the world.\n\nOn Election Day 1948, [[Harry S. Truman]] spent the night at the Elms Hotel when it appeared that he was losing his re-election bid to Republican [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. However, in the wee hours of the morning, he was awakened by his aides informing him that he had, in fact, won the election.  He was whisked away to Kansas City.

Cast.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The cast of ''Sing It!''.]]\nStacey Needles ([[Mircea Monroe]]) is the underrated production assistant from ''Sing It!'', a television music competition series. When the original executive producer was fired, she sees an opportunity to fill the position and be valued for their work. But her plan to take charge is thwarted with the arrival of newcomer indie production assistant, Drew ([[Mark Sullivan (actor)|Mark Jude Sullivan]]). He is inexperienced, but creative and excited, stealing the attention of executives, becoming the potential future executive producer, which makes Needles try to overcome every day.\n\nThe program includes the sexy and charismatic presenter Troy Blue ([[Preston Jones (actor)|Preston Jones]]) and the judges Holli Holiday ([[Debby Ryan]]), a famous and egocentric singer, who uses the program to self-promote, and Barry ([[Alex D\u00e9sert]]), an artist manager and television producer, who is rarely impressed by a contestant. During the program, ten contestants was selected at the auditions to compete, where each week one of them was eliminated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://broadmark.de/allgemein/youtube-red-originals-serien-und-filme-mit-pewdiepie-fine-brothers-und-co/38289/|title=YouTube Red Originals: Serien und Filme mit PewDiePie, Fine Brothers und Co.|publisher=BroadMark|accessdate=January 10, 2016|date=November 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n*[[Mircea Monroe]] as Stacey Needles, a production assistant, who wants to be executive producer.<ref name=maincast>{{cite web|url=https://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/sing-it-2016|title=Sing It! 2016 Tribeca Film Festival|publisher=Tribeca Film Festival|accessdate=January 10, 2016|date=November 17, 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Mark Sullivan (actor)|Mark Jude Sullivan]] as Drew, the new production assistant, who becomes a potential future executive producer.<ref name=maincast/>\n*[[Debby Ryan]] as Holli Holiday, one of the judges.

Under this scenario, jakobids acquired their bacteria-type RNA polymerase much more recently and that then spread via lateral gene transfer.<ref name=simpsonbook2017 /> However, the gene arrangement of jakobid mitochondrial DNA suggests an ancestral origin of bacteria-type RNA polymerase over a more-recent divergence.<ref name=burger2013 /><ref name=simpsonbook2017 />\n\nThe last of the proposed scenarios suggests that the common ancestor of eukaryotes had two mitochondrial RNA polymerases, both phage-type and bacteria-type, and jakobids lost their phage-type polymerase while the rest of the eukaryotes lost the bacteria-type, possibly several times.<ref name=simpsonbook2017 /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stechmann |first1=Alexandra |last2=Cavalier-Smith |first2=Thomas |title=Rooting the Eukaryote Tree by Using a Derived Gene Fusion |journal=Science |date=2002 |volume=297 |issue=5578 |pages=89\u201391 |pmid=12098695 |doi=10.1126/science.1071196 }}</ref> Such a model eliminates the need for jakobids to be truly basal. One study proposed that the phage-type and bacteria-type polymerases, when present in the same mitochondrion, served different functions, much in the way that the organelles of land plants have two different RNA polymerase enzymes that transcribe different genes.<ref name=simpsonbook2017 />\n\n==Taxonomy==\nJakobida contains five families consisting of mostly free-swimming genera: [[Jakobidae]], [[Moramonadidae]], [[Andaluciidae]], and [[Stygiellidae]].<ref name=simpsonbook2017 /> The sixth family, [[Histionidae]], is largely populated by [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] [[Lorica (biology)|loricate]] genera, and includes the first jakobids ever described.<ref name=simpsonbook2017 />\n\nJakobids are a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] group, and are most closely related to the [[Euglenozoa]] and [[Heterolobosea]].<ref name=burger2013 /><ref name=simpsonbook2017 /><ref name=rodriguez2007 />\n\n* Class [[Jakobea]] <small>Cavalier-Smith 1999</small>\n** Order [[Jakobida]] <small>Cavalier-Smith 1993</small>\n*** Sub Order [[Andaluciina]] <small>Cavalier-Smith 2013</small>\n**** Family [[Andaluciidae]] <small>Cavalier-Smith 2013</small>\n***** Genus ''[[Andalucia (genus)|Andalucia]]'' <small>Lara et al. 2006</small>\n****** Species ''[[Andalucia godoyi]]'' <small>Lara et al. 2006</small>\n**** Family [[Stygiellidae]] <small>P\u00e1nek, T\u00e1borsk\u00fd & \u010cepi\u010dka 2015</small><ref name=panek2015 />\n***** Genus ''[[Velundella]]'' <small>P\u00e1nek, T\u00e1borsk\u00fd & \u010cepi\u010dka 2015</small>\n****** Species  ''[[Velundella nauta|V. nauta]]'' <small>P\u00e1nek, T\u00e1borsk\u00fd & \u010cepi\u010dka 2015</small>\n****** Species  ''[[Velundella trypanoides|V. trypanoides]]'' <small>P\u00e1nek, T\u00e1borsk\u00fd & \u010cepi\u010dka 2015</small>\n***** Genus ''[[Stygiella (protist)|Stygiella]]'' <small>P\u00e1nek, T\u00e1borsk\u00fd & \u010cepi\u010dka 2015 non Bruand 1853</small>\n****** Species  ''[[Stygiella incarcerata|S. incarcerata]]'' <small>(Bernard, Simpson & Patterson 2000) P\u00e1nek, T\u00e1borsk\u00fd & \u010cepi\u010dka 2015</small> [''Jakoba incarcerata'' <small>Bernard, Simpson & Patterson 2000</small>;
