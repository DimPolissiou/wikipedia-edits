Based on a story by [[Irving Berlin]], the film is about a dancer who loves a showgirl who loves a compulsive nightclub-opener who can't stay committed to anything in life for very long. Produced by [[Sol C. Siegel]], ''Blue Skies'' was filmed in [[Technicolor]] and released by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The music, lyrics, and story were written by [[Irving Berlin]], with most of the songs recycled from earlier works.\n\nAs in ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942), the film is designed to showcase Berlin's songs. The plot, which is presented in a series of flashbacks with Astaire as narrator, follows a similar formula of Crosby beating Astaire for the affections of a leading lady. Comedy is principally provided by [[Billy De Wolfe]] and several musical numbers are performed by [[Olga San Juan]].\n\nJoan Caulfield was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Mark Sandrich]], who directed many of the Astaire-[[Ginger Rogers]] musicals. Sandrich was originally slated to direct this film, but died of a heart attack during pre-production and Stuart Heisler was drafted in to replace him. Heisler wanted Caulfield replaced, but Crosby\u2014who was having an affair with Caulfield\u2014protected her.\n\nTap dancer [[Paul Draper (dancer)|Paul Draper]] was the initial choice to partner Crosby; however, during the first week of production Draper's speech impediment and his trenchant criticism of Caulfield's dance ability led Crosby to insist on his replacement by Astaire, who, then 47, had already decided that this would be his final film and that he would retire, having spent over 40 years performing before the public. The film was billed as \"Astaire's last picture\" and its very strong performance at the box office pleased him greatly, as he had dearly wanted to go out on a high note.\n\nThe reasons for Astaire's (temporary) retirement remain a source of debate: his own view that he was \"tired and running out of gas,\" the sudden collapse in 1945 of the market for [[Swing (genre)|Swing]] music which left many of his colleagues in jazz high and dry, a desire to devote time to establishing a chain of dancing schools, and a dissatisfaction with roles, as in this film, where he was relegated to playing second fiddle to the lead. Ironically, it is for his celebrated [[Fred Astaire's Solo and Partnered Dances|solo performance]] of \"[[Puttin' On The Ritz]],\" which featured Astaire leading an entire dance line of Astaires, that this film is most remembered by some today.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is told in a series of vignettes and musical numbers that serve to show events in flashback. Our narrative link is New York radio star Jed Potter, who once was a renowned Broadway hoofer. The conceit is that he is on the air, telling his life story, which does not yet have an ending.\n\nThe tale starts just after World War I and centers on two men who became friends in the Army: rising dancer Potter and business-minded Johnny Adams.  While hardworking Potter dreams of stardom, the more laid-back and less disciplined Adams has hopes of becoming a successful nightclub owner.\n\nIn time, dancer Potter falls in love with a band singer, Mary O'Hara. He takes Mary to Adams' nightclub, where she takes a shine to Adams. Potter warns Mary that his old buddy is not the marrying kind, but she marries Adams. The union is not a happy one, despite the birth of a child. Adams' nightclub business is anything but a resounding success, and it turns out Potter was right: Adams is self-centered and unable to commit to his nightclubs, his marriage, or his daughter.\n\nThe couple divorces, and Mary tries again with Potter. The two even become engaged, but Mary can't go through with the wedding and takes off. A devastated Potter turns to booze and subsequently suffers an accident that puts an end to his dancing career. He winds up behind a radio microphone, sharing his story with his audience, hoping that wherever Mary is, she can hear him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bing Crosby]] as Johnny Adams\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Jed Potter\n* [[Joan Caulfield]] as Mary O'Hara\n* [[Billy De Wolfe]] as Tony\n* [[Olga San Juan]] as Nita Nova\n* [[Mikhail Rasumny]] as Fran\u00e7ois\n* [[Frank Faylen]] as Mack\n* [[Victoria Horne]] as Martha (nurse)\n* [[Karolyn Grimes]] as Mary Elizabeth Adams\n}}\n\n==Production==\nJoan Caulfield was pulled out of the film.

Such a one is the Paramount\u2019s current and cheerfully diverting \u201cBlue Skies,\u201d which catalogues some songs of Irving Berlin without catalyzing that gentleman's career.

In contrast, Astaire, assisted by choreographers [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]] and Dave Robel (for the \"Puttin' on the Ritz\" routine), delivers a series of dances which explore the theme of confrontation, both with partners and with the audience. As a result, it is one of only a few Astaire films not to feature a romantic-partnered dance.\n\n* \"A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody\": Berlin's 1919 song is presented as part of a big [[Ziegfeld Follies]] production number, an aesthetic which Astaire parodies in this partnered dance with Caulfield and others. In the first of a series of references to films he made earlier in the 1940s, he reprises a tap sequence performed atop a bar counter in the \"[[One for My Baby (And One More for the Road)|One for My Baby]]\" number from ''[[The Sky's the Limit (1943 film)|The Sky's the Limit]]'' (1943), this time danced down a stairway.\n* \"[[I've Got My Captain Working for Me Now]]\": This song, composed in 1919, is performed by Crosby, backed up by [[Billy De Wolfe]].\n* \"[[You'd Be Surprised]]\": Another 1919 song, this time performed by [[Olga San Juan]].\n* \"[[All by Myself (Irving Berlin song)|All by Myself]]\": Crosby performs this 1921 song to Caulfield, who harmonizes with him in the closing phrases.\n* \"Serenade to an Old-Fashioned Girl\": Caulfield sings this number, specially written for the film.\n[[Image:Astaire Puttin on the Ritz.jpg|right|thumb|Fred Astaire and a chorus of Fred Astaires in \"Puttin' on the Ritz\"]]\n* \"[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]\": Although Berlin's 1930 song was originally written for vaudevillian [[Harry Richman]], it has become indelibly associated with Astaire, who also recorded it for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] in 1930. In this [[Fred Astaire's Solo and Partnered Dances|tap solo with cane]], which was widely billed as \"Astaire's last dance\", the lyrics are updated,<ref>Mueller, p.267: \"The change may have had to do with changing attitudes towards race and Hollywood's dawning wariness about offending blacks.\"</ref> replacing references to ritzy Harlemites with wealthy whites strutting their stuff up and down [[Lenox Avenue]] in [[Harlem]]. The routine was produced after the rest of the film had been completed, and according to Astaire, it took \"five weeks of back-breaking physical work\" to prepare. It is constructed in three sections, beginning in a dull book-lined office with a tired-looking Astaire showing his years and dressed in a [[morning suit]]. Here Astaire delivers the song while executing a gentle tap and cane solo in mock slow-motion, in an amusing parody of his impending retirement. The song finished, he returns to dancing at normal speed and dances around the office while executing an ingenious jumping cane routine, which relied on a concealed floor trigger mechanism.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Thus rejuvenated, Astaire sweeps aside a pair of drab curtains to reveal a chorus of nine Fred Astaires \u2013 achieved by filming two separate versions of Astaire, repeating them four times and interleaving them. The final section of the number is a repeat of the tune with a greatly reduced tempo, which accompanies a complex routine for Astaire and chorus. In \"[[Top Hat, White Tie and Tails]]\" from ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), Astaire proceeded to machine-gun his chorus dancers with his cane. This time, Astaire joins his chorus in adopting a confrontational, at times almost menacing posture towards his audience.<ref>Mueller, p.267</ref> In 1957, on the brink of yet another temporary retirement, Astaire wittily refers back to this routine in the self-parodying \"The Ritz, Roll And Rock\" number from ''[[Silk Stockings (1957 film)|Silk Stockings]]''.\n* \"(I'll See You In) C-U-B-A\": A 1920 song performed as a duet by Crosby and San Juan.\n* \"A Couple of Song and Dance Men\": A comic song and dance duet for Astaire and Crosby to a number specially composed for the film. The concept is a reworking of the \"I'll Capture Your Heart\" number from ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942) and the comedy centres on Crosby's legendary reluctance to rehearse.\n* \"[[You Keep Coming Back Like a Song]]\": Crosby performs this specially composed number.\n* \"[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]\": Crosby sings this 1926 ballad, the film's title song, to Caulfield.\n* \"Nightclub Montage\": Crosby performs fragments of  \"The Little Things In Life\" (1930), \"Not for All the Rice In China\" (1933) and \"Russian Lullaby\" (1927).\n* \"Everybody Step\": Crosby sings this 1921 number, followed by a brief dance for chorus choreographed by Hermes Pan. Crosby directs the chorus in the opening stages, a concept revived and further developed by Pan for the opening number of ''[[An Evening with Fred Astaire]]'' (1958).\n* \"[[How Deep Is the Ocean?]]\": Crosby performs this 1932 song in a musing style, backed by a female quartet.\n* \"(Running Around In Circles) Getting Nowhere\": Crosby sings this specially composed song to his daughter, played by Karolyn Grimes.\n* \"[[Heat Wave (Irving Berlin song)|Heat Wave]]\": The film's major production number features Astaire, Olga San Juan and chorus in a brightly coloured Latin-themed setting. It begins with San Juan's rendition \u2013 with the lyric \"making her seat wave\" toned down to \"making her feet wave\" \u2013 of this 1933 song, while Astaire approaches warily, using dance steps reminiscent of those used in the \"Dream Ballet\" number from ''[[Yolanda and the Thief]]'' (1945), followed by a partnered dance for Astaire and San Juan, and then a tap solo section for Astaire who quotes from the \"Boogie Barcarolle (Rehearsal Sequence)\" number from ''[[You'll Never Get Rich]]'' (1941). This solo section was shot in one take and features music specially composed by Astaire, the only time his music was used in a film. In a counterpoint to the film's opening number, this number ends with him ascending a staircase, only to fall dramatically from a precipice, ending his character's dance career.\n* \"Wartime Medley\": Crosby performs excerpts from \"Any Bonds Today\" (1941), \"This Is The Army, Mr. Jones\" (1942) and \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\" (1942) \u2013 which he had introduced in his previous film with Astaire: ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942).\n* \"You Keep Coming Back Like a Song/Blue Skies (reprise)\": Performed by Crosby and Caulfield at the film's close.\n\nThe other Berlin songs which featured only as background music in the film are, in order of use: \"Tell Me Little Gypsy\" (1920), \"Nobody Knows\" (1920), \"Mandy\" (1918), \"I Wonder\" (1919), \"Some Sunny Day\" (1922), \"When You Walked Out Someone Else Walked In\" (1923), \"Because I Love You\" (1926), \"Homesick\" (1922), \"How Many Times\" (1926), \"The Song Is Ended\" (1927), \"Lazy\" (1924), \"Always\" (1925) and \"I Can't Remember\" (1933).\n\n[[File:A-481 Blue Skies.jpg|thumb|''Blue Skies'' (Decca Records 1946)]]\nOther Irving Berlin sings which were recorded by Bing Crosby for the film soundtrack but omitted from the released print were \"[[Say It Isn't So (Irving Berlin song)|Say It Isn't So]]\", \"[[What'll I Do]]\", \"[[All Alone (Irving Berlin song)|All Alone]]\", \"[[Remember (Irving Berlin song)|Remember]]\", \"[[I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket]]\", \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\" and \"[[God Bless America]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Fred|title=Road to Hollywood|date=1986|publisher=John Joyce|page=166}}</ref>\n\nBing Crosby recorded many of the songs for [[Decca Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Bing Crosby Discography|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/crosby1bDecca.html|website=A Bing Crosby Discography|accessdate=January 22, 2016}}</ref> and these were also issued as a 5-disc, 78 rpm album titled [[Blue Skies (Decca album)]]. \u201cYou Keep Coming Back Like a Song\u201d was in the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts for six weeks with a peak position of #12.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whitburn|first1=Joel|title=Pop Memories 1890-1954|date=1986|publisher=Record Research Inc|location=Wisconsin, USA|isbn=0-89820-083-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/joelwpopmemories00whit/page/110 110]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/joelwpopmemories00whit/page/110}}</ref> Crosby's songs were also included in the [[Bing's Hollywood vols.1-15#Blue Skies|Bing's Hollywood]] series.\n\n==Reception==\nAccording to ''Variety'' the film earned $5&nbsp;million in rentals in 1946.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/variety165-1947-01#page/n54/mode/1up \"60 Top Grossers of 1946\", ''Variety'' 8 January 1947 p8]</ref>\n\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2006: [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals]] \u2013 Nominated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/musicals_ballot.pdf |title= AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals Nominees |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-13}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n*Fred Astaire: ''Steps in Time'', 1959, multiple reprints.\n*Larry Billman: ''Fred Astaire \u2013 A Bio-bibliography'', Greenwood Press 1997, {{ISBN|0-313-29010-5}}\n*John Mueller: ''Astaire Dancing \u2013 The Musical Films of Fred Astaire'', Knopf 1985, {{ISBN|0-394-51654-0}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title | id=0038370}}\n* {{Amg movie|85522}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=69230}}\n\n{{Irving Berlin}}\n{{Stuart Heisler}}\n\n[[Category:1946 films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stuart Heisler]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:1940s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Irving Berlin]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Sol C.

Based on a story by [[Irving Berlin]], the film is about a dancer who loves a showgirl who loves a compulsive nightclub-opener who can't stay committed to anything in life for very long. Produced by [[Sol C. Siegel]], ''Blue Skies'' was filmed in [[Technicolor]] and released by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The music, lyrics, and story were written by [[Irving Berlin]], with most of the songs recycled from earlier works.\n\nAs in ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942), the film is designed to showcase Berlin's songs. The plot, which is presented in a series of flashbacks with Astaire as narrator, follows a similar formula of Crosby beating Astaire for the affections of a leading lady. Comedy is principally provided by [[Billy De Wolfe]] and several musical numbers are performed by [[Olga San Juan]].\n\nJoan Caulfield was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Mark Sandrich]], who directed many of the Astaire-[[Ginger Rogers]] musicals. Sandrich was originally slated to direct this film, but died of a heart attack during pre-production and Stuart Heisler was drafted in to replace him.

The concept is a reworking of the \"I'll Capture Your Heart\" number from ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942) and the comedy centres on Crosby's legendary reluctance to rehearse.\n* \"[[You Keep Coming Back Like a Song]]\": Crosby performs this specially composed number.\n* \"[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]\": Crosby sings this 1926 ballad, the film's title song, to Caulfield.\n* \"Nightclub Montage\": Crosby performs fragments of  \"The Little Things In Life\" (1930), \"Not for All the Rice In China\" (1933) and \"Russian Lullaby\" (1927).\n* \"Everybody Step\": Crosby sings this 1921 number, followed by a brief dance for chorus choreographed by Hermes Pan. Crosby directs the chorus in the opening stages, a concept revived and further developed by Pan for the opening number of ''[[An Evening with Fred Astaire]]'' (1958).\n* \"[[How Deep Is the Ocean?]]\": Crosby performs this 1932 song in a musing style, backed by a female quartet.\n* \"(Running Around In Circles) Getting Nowhere\": Crosby sings this specially composed song to his daughter, played by Karolyn Grimes.\n* \"[[Heat Wave (Irving Berlin song)|Heat Wave]]\": The film's major production number features Astaire, Olga San Juan and chorus in a brightly coloured Latin-themed setting. It begins with San Juan's rendition \u2013 with the lyric \"making her seat wave\" toned down to \"making her feet wave\" \u2013 of this 1933 song, while Astaire approaches warily, using dance steps reminiscent of those used in the \"Dream Ballet\" number from ''[[Yolanda and the Thief]]'' (1945), followed by a partnered dance for Astaire and San Juan, and then a tap solo section for Astaire who quotes from the \"Boogie Barcarolle (Rehearsal Sequence)\" number from ''[[You'll Never Get Rich]]'' (1941). This solo section was shot in one take and features music specially composed by Astaire, the only time his music was used in a film. In a counterpoint to the film's opening number, this number ends with him ascending a staircase, only to fall dramatically from a precipice, ending his character's dance career.\n* \"Wartime Medley\": Crosby performs excerpts from \"Any Bonds Today\" (1941), \"This Is The Army, Mr. Jones\" (1942) and \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\" (1942) \u2013 which he had introduced in his previous film with Astaire: ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942).\n* \"You Keep Coming Back Like a Song/Blue Skies (reprise)\": Performed by Crosby and Caulfield at the film's close.\n\nThe other Berlin songs which featured only as background music in the film are, in order of use: \"Tell Me Little Gypsy\" (1920), \"Nobody Knows\" (1920), \"Mandy\" (1918), \"I Wonder\" (1919), \"Some Sunny Day\" (1922), \"When You Walked Out Someone Else Walked In\" (1923), \"Because I Love You\" (1926), \"Homesick\" (1922), \"How Many Times\" (1926), \"The Song Is Ended\" (1927), \"Lazy\" (1924), \"Always\" (1925) and \"I Can't Remember\" (1933).\n\n[[File:A-481 Blue Skies.jpg|thumb|''Blue Skies'' (Decca Records 1946)]]\nOther Irving Berlin sings which were recorded by Bing Crosby for the film soundtrack but omitted from the released print were \"[[Say It Isn't So (Irving Berlin song)|Say It Isn't So]]\", \"[[What'll I Do]]\", \"[[All Alone (Irving Berlin song)|All Alone]]\", \"[[Remember (Irving Berlin song)|Remember]]\", \"[[I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket]]\", \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\" and \"[[God Bless America]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Fred|title=Road to Hollywood|date=1986|publisher=John Joyce|page=166}}</ref>\n\nBing Crosby recorded many of the songs for [[Decca Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Bing Crosby Discography|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/crosby1bDecca.html|website=A Bing Crosby Discography|accessdate=January 22, 2016}}</ref> and these were also issued as a 5-disc, 78 rpm album titled [[Blue Skies (Decca album)]]. \u201cYou Keep Coming Back Like a Song\u201d was in the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts for six weeks with a peak position of #12.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whitburn|first1=Joel|title=Pop Memories 1890-1954|date=1986|publisher=Record Research Inc|location=Wisconsin, USA|isbn=0-89820-083-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/joelwpopmemories00whit/page/110 110]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/joelwpopmemories00whit/page/110}}</ref> Crosby's songs were also included in the [[Bing's Hollywood vols.1-15#Blue Skies|Bing's Hollywood]] series.\n\n==Reception==\nAccording to ''Variety'' the film earned $5 million in rentals in 1946.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/variety165-1947-01#page/n54/mode/1up \"60 Top Grossers of 1946\", ''Variety'' 8 January 1947 p8]</ref>\n\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2006: [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals]] \u2013 Nominated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/musicals_ballot.pdf |title= AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals Nominees |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-13}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n*Fred Astaire: ''Steps in Time'', 1959, multiple reprints.\n*John Mueller: ''Astaire Dancing \u2013 The Musical Films of Fred Astaire'', Knopf 1985, {{ISBN|0-394-51654-0}}\n*Larry Billman: ''Fred Astaire \u2013 A Bio-bibliography'', Greenwood Press 1997, {{ISBN|0-313-29010-5}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title | id=0038370}}\n* {{Amg movie|85522}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=69230}}\n\n{{Irving Berlin}}\n{{Stuart Heisler}}\n\n[[Category:1946 films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stuart Heisler]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:1940s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Irving Berlin]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Sol C.

In 1952 WPAC gave him the First Prize Gold Medal Award for his abstract painting ''The Happy Family''.{{sfn|Renowned Artist...}}\nHe was given a [[British Council]] art scholarship in 1954, the last such scholarship to be awarded in Guyana in this period, with which he was able to study ceramics at the [[Bath School of Art and Design]] at [[Corsham]], England.{{sfn|Greaves|2010|p=170}}\nThe Guyana Department of Education provided an additional scholarship that funded his third year at Corsham.{{sfn|Locke|2007}}\nHe was taught painting by [[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]] and [[Bryan Wynter]], pottery by James Tower and sculpture by Ken Armitage and [[Bernard Meadows]].\nHe graduated in 1957 with a Teaching Certificate in Art Education.{{sfn|Stella Jones Gallery}}\n\n===Guyana and United Kingdom===\n\nReturning to Georgetown in 1957, Locke began teaching art at Dolphin Government School and at WPAC.\nIn 1958 he married [[Leila Locke]] (n\u00e9e) Chaplin, a teacher whom he had met at Corsham.<ref name=\"Bissember1988\">Elfrieda Bissember, ''60 Years of Women artists in Guyana 1928\u20131988 a Historical Perspective'', Guyana Women Artists' Association, 1988.</ref>\nHe did not have normal potter's equipment, but was able to make and successfully fire large earthenware pots using an improvised kiln.\nIn 1959 the Guyanese government gave him a grant to study for a master's degree in fine arts at [[Edinburgh College of Art]], a school in the [[University of Edinburgh]].\nThere he met the artists Dave Cohen, Sheldon Kaganof and Dion Myers, who introduced the ideas of the [[California Clay Movement]] to Britain.\nFor many years Locke's work reflected their influence.{{sfn|Locke|2007}}\n\nIn 1962 Locke obtained a grant from Edinburgh University to go to [[Florence]] and [[Ravenna]], where he undertook historical research \nHe completed his graduate thesis in 1964 and returned to Georgetown to take up a position as Art Master at [[Queen's College, Guyana|Queen's College]],{{sfn|Locke|2007}} where he taught from 1964 until 1970.{{sfn|Queen's College Alumni Association|2012|p=6}}\nHe began painting due to lack of facilities for pottery.\nIn 1969 he obtained a [[British Council]] bursary that let him take leave from Queen's College and return to the Edinburgh College of Art for research in ceramic techniques.\nIn 1970, after a trip to Brazil sponsored by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he resigned from Queen's College and moved to London, where he obtained work teaching ceramics.\nHis work began to incorporate materials such as metal, wood, leather, fur and ceramics.{{sfn|Locke|2007}} \nHe gained a growing recognition for his ceramic work, and in 1972 was invited to exhibit at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in the ''International Exhibition of Ceramics''.{{sfn|de Souza|2001|p=255}}\n\n===United States===\n\nLocke visited the United States for the first time in 1976, as guest artist at [[Haystack Mountain School of Crafts]] in [[Montville, Maine]].{{sfn|Locke|2007}}\nIn 1979 he was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in Sculpture, and for a year was an artist in residence at [[Arizona State University]].{{sfn|Archer|2012}} His first of many bronze sculptures were cast by the Arizona Bronze Foundry in 1980.\nHe divorced Leila in the late 1970s,<ref name=\"Earl1992\">Claudette Earl, \"Leila Elizabeth Locke \u2013 an appreciation\", ''Chronicle Family Magazine'', 19 April 1992.</ref> and obtained permanent residency status in the United States, marrying Art Consultant Brenda Stephenson in 1981.\nIn 1983 he moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]].{{sfn|Locke|2007}}\nLocke lived in the southwest of the United States for 11 years.  During this period he was the Arizona correspondent for ''[[Artspace]]'' magazine, \nfor which he wrote a series of articles. He also wrote for the ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' and for ''[[Arts Magazine]]''.{{sfn|Renowned Artist...}}\n\nIn 1989 he temporarily abandoned sculpture in favour of painting, and the next year moved to [[Atlanta]], Georgia.{{sfn|Renowned Artist...}}\nHis paintings combined heavy paint, photographs, cloth, wood, metal and found objects mounted on canvas.\nIn 1992, with a five-year grant for a studio at the [[Nexus Contemporary Art Center]], he returned to sculpture.{{sfn|Locke|2007}}\nLocke taught part-time at [[Georgia State University]] and at the [[Atlanta College of Art]], retiring from teaching in 1996.{{sfn|Baiganchoka|2010}}\nHe continued to write about art.  Thus a review by Locke of the ''Okiek Portraits'' exhibition of photographs of [[Okiek people]] in traditional dress appeared in ''[[Creative Loafing]]'' of November 1997.{{sfn|Kratz|2002|p=2}}\nHe contributed a weekly review to this paper for three years.{{sfn|Renowned Artist...}} \nHe lived in Atlanta for the remainder of his life, with growing recognition from exhibitions of his work in the USA and Europe.{{sfn|Archer|2012}}\n\nAn outgoing person, with a generous character, Locke enjoyed entertaining people at dinners where he did all the cooking.\nHe loved to talk about art, and was an interesting and engaging speaker.{{sfn|Sirlin|2011}} He has been called \"a larger-than-life personality and a wonderful storyteller, as influential in his conversation as he was with his art.\"{{sfn|Geshwiler|2010}}\n\nDonald Locke died at home in Atlanta on 6 December 2010.{{sfn|Locke Family|2010}} He was survived by three children from his marriage with the artist Leila Locke: Corinne, Jonathan and Hew.{{sfn|Stabroek Editor|2010}} [[Hew Locke]], born in Edinburgh, is also a well-known artist.{{sfn|Laughlin|2008}}\n\n==Work==\n\nLocke's work was highly varied.  Marianne Lambert, an Atlanta curator and art patron, said: \"His expressiveness ran the gamut from frenzied drawings to the spare, clean lines of his sculptures.\"  According to [[Carl E. Hazlewood|Carl Hazlewood]] of [[Newark, NJ|Newark]], associate editor at ''NKA, a Journal of Contemporary African Art'', \"Donald's art grew out of sophisticated European traditions acquired during his studies in Guyana and Great Britain, but it also was infused with the myths and poetic aspects of his Guyana homeland and its folklore.\"\nA prolific artist throughout his life, Locke in his earlier modernist work was influenced by other schools. He came into his own as a unique individual in Atlanta under the influence of local folk artists such as [[Thornton Dial]].{{sfn|Geshwiler|2010}}\n\nTalking of the influence of the open savannah landscape of Guyana on Locke's early work, one writer said Locke was \"concerned with the question of space as it confronts the artist: what to do with nothingness; how to lead the eye of the viewer into a vast expanse through the narrow frame of a single painting.\"{{sfn|James|2012|p=40}}\nIn the United Kingdom his best known work may be the paintings and sculptures in ''The Plantation Series'', described as \"forms held in strict lines and grids, connected as if with chains or a series of bars, analogous he has said, to the system whereby one group of people are kept in economic and political subjugation by another.\"{{sfn|iniva}}\nA reviewer commenting on his work ''Trophies of Empire 1, 1972\u20131974'' said it \"comprise[s] robust disconnected forms that eerily echo the cultures and geographies he had experienced. Heavy metal vessels, solid wood forms and found objects are placed together creating awkward human effigies or challenging abstract assemblages. Their loaded erotic and sometimes violent symbolism bring to mind mournful memories from the past and issues related to slavery, identity and sovereignty. His are sombre images of the [[Paul Gilroy#The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness|Black Atlantic]] world that Locke straddled so boldly.\"{{sfn|Archer|2012}}\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\nLocke was Guyana's representative at the 12th [[S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial]] in 1971.{{sfn|Khanna|2009}} He exhibited his ''Two Sculptures from a Ritual Fertility Suite'' in Hungary in 1975 at the International Biennale of Sculpture.  In 1976 he had his own show at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in London, and in 1977 his work was displayed in Nigeria at [[Festac '77|FESTAC]].  His ''Trophies of Empire'' was first displayed at the ''Afro-Caribbean Art Exhibition'' in 1978, and was shown again at London's [[Hayward Gallery]] in 1989 in ''[[The Other Story (exhibition)|The Other Story]]'',{{sfn|de Souza|2001|pp=255\u2013256}} an influential show that helped to increase public awareness of the quality of work of Asian, African and Caribbean artists, and also featured other Caribbean artists such as [[Aubrey Williams]] and [[Ronald Moody]], as well the paintings of Black British artists including [[Sonia Boyce]].{{sfn|Kaufman|Macpherson|2005|p=110}} The art critic [[Brian Sewell]] said that Locke's sculptures in ''The Other Story'' showed exquisite mastery and extraordinary ingenuity.{{sfn|Chilvers|2004|p=120}}\n\nIn 1994 Locke went to [[Ecuador]], where his work was shown in the exhibition ''Current Identities'' at the Cuenca Bienal of Painting, along with the work of other artists including [[Whitfield Lovell]], [[Philemona Williamson]], [[Emilio Cruz]] and [[Freddy Rodr\u00edguez (artist)|Freddy Rodr\u00edguez]].{{sfn|Lovell|Lippard|2003|p=119}} \nA 2002 exhibition at the Solomon Projects gallery in Atlanta featured rough wax sculptures that represented the sacred symbols of Locke's Guyanese creole heritage.{{sfn|Byrd|2002|p=37}}\nIn 2009 an exhibition of about fifty of his recent sculptures and paintings named ''Pork Knocker Dreams'' was staged in England.  \n\"[[Porkknocker]]\" is the name given to gold prospectors in Guyana: Locke's father had prospected as a young man.{{sfn|Khanna|2009}}\n\nLocke exhibited in many other group and solo shows, including in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], Brazil; [[Medell\u00edn]], Colombia; [[Budapest]], Hungary; [[Faenza]], Italy; [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and [[Whitechapel Gallery]] in London, United Kingdom; [[Nottingham]], United Kingdom; [[Aljira Center for Contemporary Art]] in Newark, New Jersey; Nexus Biennial and the Master Artist Series, Atlanta, Georgia; [[Studio Museum in Harlem]], New York.

In 1952 WPAC gave him the First Prize Gold Medal Award for his abstract painting ''The Happy Family''.{{sfn|Renowned Artist...}}\nHe was given a [[British Council]] art scholarship in 1954, the last such scholarship to be awarded in Guyana in this period, with which he was able to study ceramics at the [[Bath School of Art and Design]] at [[Corsham]], England.{{sfn|Greaves|2010|p=170}}\nThe Guyana Department of Education provided an additional scholarship that funded his third year at Corsham.{{sfn|Locke|2007}}\nHe was taught painting by [[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]] and [[Bryan Wynter]], pottery by James Tower and sculpture by Ken Armitage and [[Bernard Meadows]].\nHe graduated in 1957 with a Teaching Certificate in Art Education.{{sfn|Stella Jones Gallery}}\n\n===Guyana and United Kingdom===\n\nReturning to Georgetown in 1957, Locke began teaching art at Dolphin Government School and at WPAC.\nIn 1958 he married [[Leila Locke]] (n\u00e9e) Chaplin, a teacher whom he had met at Corsham.<ref name=\"Bissember1988\">Elfrieda Bissember, ''60 Years of Women artists in Guyana 1928\u20131988 a Historical Perspective'', Guyana Women Artists' Association, 1988.</ref>\nHe did not have normal potter's equipment, but was able to make and successfully fire large earthenware pots using an improvised kiln.\nIn 1959 the Guyanese government gave him a grant to study for a master's degree in fine arts at [[Edinburgh College of Art]], a school in the [[University of Edinburgh]].\nThere he met the artists Dave Cohen, Sheldon Kaganof and Dion Myers, who introduced the ideas of the [[California Clay Movement]] to Britain.\nFor many years Locke's work reflected their influence.{{sfn|Locke|2007}}\n\nIn 1962 Locke obtained a grant from Edinburgh University to go to [[Florence]] and [[Ravenna]], where he undertook historical research \nHe completed his graduate thesis in 1964 and returned to Georgetown to take up a position as Art Master at [[Queen's College, Guyana|Queen's College]],{{sfn|Locke|2007}} where he taught from 1964 until 1970.{{sfn|Queen's College Alumni Association|2012|p=6}}\nHe began painting due to lack of facilities for pottery.\nIn 1969 he obtained a [[British Council]] bursary that let him take leave from Queen's College and return to the Edinburgh College of Art for research in ceramic techniques.\nIn 1970, after a trip to Brazil sponsored by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he resigned from Queen's College and moved to London, where he obtained work teaching ceramics.\nHis work began to incorporate materials such as metal, wood, leather, fur and ceramics.{{sfn|Locke|2007}} \nHe gained a growing recognition for his ceramic work, and in 1972 was invited to exhibit at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in the ''International Exhibition of Ceramics''.{{sfn|de Souza|2001|p=255}}\n\n===United States===\n\nLocke visited the United States for the first time in 1976, as guest artist at [[Haystack Mountain School of Crafts]] in [[Montville, Maine]].{{sfn|Locke|2007}}\nIn 1979 he was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in Sculpture, and for a year was an artist in residence at [[Arizona State University]].{{sfn|Archer|2012}} His first of many bronze sculptures were cast by the Arizona Bronze Foundry in 1980.\nHe divorced Leila in the late 1970s,<ref name=\"Earl1992\">Claudette Earl, \"Leila Elizabeth Locke \u2013 an appreciation\", ''Chronicle Family Magazine'', 19 April 1992.</ref> and obtained permanent residency status in the United States, marrying Art Consultant Brenda Stephenson in 1981.\nIn 1983 he moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]].{{sfn|Locke|2007}}\nLocke lived in the southwest of the United States for 11 years.  During this period he was the Arizona correspondent for ''[[Artspace]]'' magazine, \nfor which he wrote a series of articles. He also wrote for the ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' and for ''[[Arts Magazine]]''.{{sfn|Renowned Artist...}}\n\nIn 1989 he temporarily abandoned sculpture in favour of painting, and the next year moved to [[Atlanta]], Georgia.{{sfn|Renowned Artist...}}\nHis paintings combined heavy paint, photographs, cloth, wood, metal and found objects mounted on canvas.\nIn 1992, with a five-year grant for a studio at the [[Nexus Contemporary Art Center]], he returned to sculpture.{{sfn|Locke|2007}}\nLocke taught part-time at [[Georgia State University]] and at the [[Atlanta College of Art]], retiring from teaching in 1996.{{sfn|Baiganchoka|2010}}\nHe continued to write about art.  Thus a review by Locke of the ''Okiek Portraits'' exhibition of photographs of [[Okiek people]] in traditional dress appeared in ''[[Creative Loafing]]'' of November 1997.{{sfn|Kratz|2002|p=2}}\nHe contributed a weekly review to this paper for three years.{{sfn|Renowned Artist...}} \nHe lived in Atlanta for the remainder of his life, with growing recognition from exhibitions of his work in the USA and Europe.{{sfn|Archer|2012}}\n\nAn outgoing person, with a generous character, Locke enjoyed entertaining people at dinners where he did all the cooking.\nHe loved to talk about art, and was an interesting and engaging speaker.{{sfn|Sirlin|2011}} He has been called \"a larger-than-life personality and a wonderful storyteller, as influential in his conversation as he was with his art.\"{{sfn|Geshwiler|2010}}\n\nDonald Locke died at home in Atlanta on 6 December 2010.{{sfn|Locke Family|2010}} He was survived by three children from his marriage with the artist Leila Locke: Corinne, Jonathan and Hew.{{sfn|Stabroek Editor|2010}} [[Hew Locke]], born in Edinburgh, is also a well-known artist.{{sfn|Laughlin|2008}}\n\n==Work==\n\nLocke's work was highly varied.  Marianne Lambert, an Atlanta curator and art patron, said: \"His expressiveness ran the gamut from frenzied drawings to the spare, clean lines of his sculptures.\"  According to [[Carl E. Hazlewood|Carl Hazlewood]] of [[Newark, NJ|Newark]], associate editor at ''NKA, a Journal of Contemporary African Art'', \"Donald's art grew out of sophisticated European traditions acquired during his studies in Guyana and Great Britain, but it also was infused with the myths and poetic aspects of his Guyana homeland and its folklore.\"\nA prolific artist throughout his life, Locke in his earlier modernist work was influenced by other schools. He came into his own as a unique individual in Atlanta under the influence of local folk artists such as [[Thornton Dial]].{{sfn|Geshwiler|2010}}\n\nTalking of the influence of the open savannah landscape of Guyana on Locke's early work, one writer said Locke was \"concerned with the question of space as it confronts the artist: what to do with nothingness; how to lead the eye of the viewer into a vast expanse through the narrow frame of a single painting.\"{{sfn|James|2012|p=40}}\nIn the United Kingdom his best known work may be the paintings and sculptures in ''The Plantation Series'', described as \"forms held in strict lines and grids, connected as if with chains or a series of bars, analogous he has said, to the system whereby one group of people are kept in economic and political subjugation by another.\"{{sfn|iniva}}\nA reviewer commenting on his work ''Trophies of Empire 1, 1972\u20131974'' said it \"comprise[s] robust disconnected forms that eerily echo the cultures and geographies he had experienced. Heavy metal vessels, solid wood forms and found objects are placed together creating awkward human effigies or challenging abstract assemblages. Their loaded erotic and sometimes violent symbolism bring to mind mournful memories from the past and issues related to slavery, identity and sovereignty. His are sombre images of the [[Paul Gilroy#The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness|Black Atlantic]] world that Locke straddled so boldly.\"{{sfn|Archer|2012}}\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\nLocke was Guyana's representative at the 12th [[S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial]] in 1971.{{sfn|Khanna|2009}} He exhibited his ''Two Sculptures from a Ritual Fertility Suite'' in Hungary in 1975 at the International Biennale of Sculpture.  In 1976 he had his own show at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in London, and in 1977 his work was displayed in Nigeria at [[Festac '77|FESTAC]].  His ''Trophies of Empire'' was first displayed at the ''Afro-Caribbean Art Exhibition'' in 1978, and was shown again at London's [[Hayward Gallery]] in 1989 in ''[[The Other Story (exhibition)|The Other Story]]'',{{sfn|de Souza|2001|pp=255\u2013256}} an influential show that helped to increase public awareness of the quality of work of Asian, African and Caribbean artists, and also featured other Caribbean artists such as [[Aubrey Williams]] and [[Ronald Moody]], as well the paintings of Black British artists including [[Sonia Boyce]].{{sfn|Kaufman|Macpherson|2005|p=110}} The art critic [[Brian Sewell]] said that Locke's sculptures in ''The Other Story'' showed exquisite mastery and extraordinary ingenuity.{{sfn|Chilvers|2004|p=120}}\n\nIn 1994 Locke went to [[Ecuador]], where his work was shown in the exhibition ''Current Identities'' at the Cuenca Bienal of Painting, along with the work of other artists including [[Whitfield Lovell]], [[Philemona Williamson]], [[Emilio Cruz]] and [[Freddy Rodr\u00edguez (artist)|Freddy Rodr\u00edguez]].{{sfn|Lovell|Lippard|2003|p=119}} \nA 2002 exhibition at the Solomon Projects gallery in Atlanta featured rough wax sculptures that represented the sacred symbols of Locke's Guyanese creole heritage.{{sfn|Byrd|2002|p=37}}\nIn 2009 an exhibition of about fifty of his recent sculptures and paintings named ''Pork Knocker Dreams'' was staged in England.  \n\"[[Porkknocker]]\" is the name given to gold prospectors in Guyana: Locke's father had prospected as a young man.{{sfn|Khanna|2009}}\n\nLocke exhibited in many other group and solo shows, including in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], Brazil; [[Medell\u00edn]], Colombia; [[Budapest]], Hungary; [[Faenza]], Italy; [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and [[Whitechapel Gallery]] in London, United Kingdom; [[Nottingham]], United Kingdom; [[Aljira Center for Contemporary Art]] in Newark, New Jersey; Nexus Biennial and the Master Artist Series, Atlanta, Georgia; [[Studio Museum in Harlem]], New York.

{"title_page": "Deformation theory", "text_new": "{{Short description|branch of mathematics}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''deformation theory''' is the study of ''infinitesimal conditions'' associated with varying a solution ''P'' of a problem to slightly different solutions ''P''<sub>\u03b5</sub>, where \u03b5 is a small number, or vector of small quantities. The infinitesimal conditions are therefore the result of applying the approach of [[differential calculus]] to solving a problem with [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. One might  think, in analogy, of a structure that is not completely rigid, and that deforms slightly to accommodate forces applied from the outside; this explains the name.\n\nSome characteristic phenomena are: the derivation of first-order equations by treating the \u03b5 quantities as having negligible squares; the possibility of ''isolated solutions'', in that varying a solution may not be possible, ''or'' does not bring anything new; and the question of whether the infinitesimal constraints actually 'integrate', so that their solution does provide small variations. In some form these considerations have a history of centuries in mathematics, but also in [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. For example, in the [[geometry of numbers]] a class of results called ''isolation theorems'' was recognised, with the topological interpretation of an ''open orbit'' (of a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]) around a given solution. [[Perturbation theory]] also looks at deformations, in general of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s.\n\n==Deformations of complex manifolds==\nThe most salient deformation theory in mathematics has been that of [[complex manifold]]s and [[algebraic varieties]]. This was put on a firm basis by foundational work of [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[Donald C. Spencer]], after deformation techniques had received a great deal of more tentative application in the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. One expects, intuitively, that deformation theory of the first order should equate the [[Zariski tangent space]] with a [[moduli space]]. The phenomena turn out to be rather subtle, though, in the general case.\n\nIn the case of [[Riemann surface]]s, one can explain that the complex structure on the [[Riemann sphere]] is isolated (no moduli). For genus 1, an [[elliptic curve]] has a one-parameter family of complex structures, as shown in [[elliptic function]] theory. The general Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory identifies as the key to the deformation theory the [[sheaf cohomology]] group\n\n: <math> H^1(\\Theta) \\, </math>\n\nwhere \u0398 is (the sheaf of [[Germ (mathematics)|germs]] of sections of) the holomorphic [[tangent bundle]]. There is an obstruction in the ''H''<sup>2</sup> of the same sheaf; which is always zero in case of a curve, for general reasons of dimension. In the case of genus 0 the ''H''<sup>1</sup> vanishes, also. For genus 1 the dimension is the [[Hodge number]] ''h''<sup>1,0</sup> which is therefore 1.  It is known that all curves of genus one have equations of form ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''.  These obviously depend on two parameters, a and b, whereas the isomorphism classes of such curves have only one parameter.  Hence there must be an equation relating those a and b which describe isomorphic elliptic curves.  It turns out that curves for which ''b''<sup>2</sup>''a''<sup>\u22123</sup> has the same value, describe isomorphic curves.  I.e. varying a and b is one way to deform the structure of the curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b'', but not all variations of ''a,b'' actually change the isomorphism class of the curve.\n\nOne can go further with the case of genus ''g'' > 1, using [[Serre duality]] to relate the  ''H''<sup>1</sup> to\n\n: <math> H^0(\\Omega^{[2]}) </math>\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the holomorphic [[cotangent bundle]] and the notation \u03a9<sup>[2]</sup> means the ''tensor square'' (''not'' the second [[exterior power]]). In other words, deformations are regulated by holomorphic [[quadratic differential]]s on a Riemann surface, again something known classically. The dimension of the moduli space, called [[Teichm\u00fcller space]] in this case, is computed as 3''g'' &minus; 3, by the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]].\n\nThese examples are the beginning of a theory applying to holomorphic families of complex manifolds, of any dimension. Further developments included: the extension by Spencer of the techniques to other structures of [[differential geometry]]; the assimilation of the Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory into the abstract algebraic geometry of [[Grothendieck]], with a consequent substantive clarification of earlier work; and deformation theory of other structures, such as algebras.\n\n==Functorial description==\nAnother method for formalizing deformation theory is using functors on the category <math>\\text{Art}_k</math> of local Artin algebras over a field. A '''pre-deformation functor''' is defined as a functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Art}_k \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nsuch that <math>F(k)</math> is a point. The idea is that we want to study the infinitesimal structure of some [[moduli space]] around a point where lying above that point is the space of interest. It is typically the case that it is easier to describe the functor for a moduli problem instead of finding an actual space. For example, if we want to consider the moduli-space of hypersurfaces of degree <math>d</math> in <math>\\mathbb{P}^n</math>, then we could consider the functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Sch} \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\nF(S) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\nS\n\\end{matrix}\n: \\text{ each fiber is a degree } d \\text{ hypersurface in }\\mathbb{P}^n\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nAlthough in general, it is more convenient/required to work with functors of [[groupoid|groupoids]] instead of sets. This is true for moduli of curves.\n\n===Technical remarks about infinitesimals===\nInfinitesimals have long been in use by mathematicians for non-rigorous arguments in calculus. The idea is that if we consider polynomials <math>F(x,\\varepsilon)</math> with an infinitesimal <math>\\varepsilon</math>, then only the first order terms really matter; that is, we can consider\n:<math> F(x,\\varepsilon) \\equiv f(x) + \\varepsilon g(x) + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nA simple application of this is that we can find the derivatives of [[monomial|monomials]] using infinitesimals:\n:<math> (x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nthe <math>\\varepsilon</math> term contains the derivative of the monomial, demonstrating its use in calculus. We could also interpret this equation as the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of the monomial. Infinitesimals can be made rigorous using nilpotent elements in local artin algebras. In the ring <math>k[y]/(y^2)</math> we see that arguments with infinitesimals can work. This motivates the notation <math>k[\\varepsilon] = k[y]/(y^2)</math>, which is called the [[Ring of dual numbers]]. \n\nMoreover, if we want to consider higher-order terms of a taylor approximation then we could consider the artin algebras <math>k[y]/(y^k)</math>. For our monomial, suppose we want to write out the second order expansion, then\n:<math>(x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + 3x\\varepsilon^2 + \\varepsilon^3</math>\nRecall that a Taylor expansion (at zero) can be written out as\n:<math>f(x) = f(0) + \\frac{f^{(1)}(x)}{1!} + \\frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!} + \\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!} + \\cdots </math>\nhence the previous two equations show that the second derivative of <math>x^3</math> is <math>6x</math>.\n\nIn general, since we want to consider arbitrary order Taylor expansions in any number of variables, we will consider the category of all local artin algebras over a field.\n\n===Motivation===\nTo motivative the definition of a pre-deformation functor, consider the projective hypersurface over a field\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nIf we want to consider an infinitesimal deformation of this space, then we could write down a Cartesian square\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{ \\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3][\\varepsilon]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 + \\varepsilon  x_0^{a_0} x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} x_3^{a_3}) } \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow\\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 4</math>. Then, the space on the right hand corner is one example of an infinitesimal deformation: the extra scheme theoretic structure of the nilpotent elements in <math>\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])</math> (which is topologically a point) allows us to organize this infinitesimal data. Since we want to consider all possible expansions, we will let our predeformation functor be defined on objects as\n:<math>\nF(A) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n</math>\nwhere <math>A</math> is a local Artin <math>k</math>-algebra.\n\n===Smooth pre-deformation functors===\nA pre-deformation functor is called '''smooth''' if for any surjection <math>A' \\to A</math> such that the square of any element in the kernel is zero, there is a surjection\n:<math>F(A') \\to F(A)</math>\nThis is motivated by the following question: given a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\ndoes there exist an extension of this cartesian diagram to the cartesian diagrams\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}' \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A')\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthe name smooth comes from the lifting criterion of a smooth morphism of schemes.\n\n===Tangent space===\nRecall that the tangent space of a scheme <math>X</math> can be described as the <math>\\operatorname{Hom}</math>-set\n:<math>TX := \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\text{Sch}/k}(\\operatorname{Spec}(k[x]),X)</math>\nSince we are considering the tangent space of a point of some moduli space, we can define the tangent space of our (pre)-deformation functor as\n:<math>T_F := F(k[\\varepsilon])</math>\n\n== Applications of deformation theory ==\n=== Bend-and-break ===\nDeformation theory was famously applied in [[birational geometry]] by [[Shigefumi Mori]] to study the existence of [[rational curve]]s on [[algebraic variety|varieties]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Olivier|last = Debarre | author-link = Olivier Debarre|  title = Higher-Dimensional Algebraic Geometry|year = 2001 | publisher= Springer| chapter = 3. Bend-and-Break Lemmas | series = Universitext}}</ref> For a [[Fano variety]] of positive dimension Mori showed that there is a rational curve passing through every point. The method of the proof later became known as '''Mori's bend-and-break'''. The rough idea is to start with some curve ''C'' through a chosen point and keep deforming it until it breaks into several [[irreducible component|components]]. Replacing ''C'' by one of the components has the effect of decreasing either the   [[genus of a curve|genus]] or the [[degree of an algebraic variety|degree]] of ''C''. So after several repetitions of the procedure, eventually we'll obtain a curve of genus 0, i.e. a rational curve. The existence and the properties of deformations of ''C'' require arguments from deformation theory and a reduction to [[positive characteristic]].\n\n===Arithmetic deformations===\nOne of the major applications of deformation theory is in arithmetic. It can be used to answer the following question: if we have a variety <math>X/\\mathbb{F}_p</math>, what are the possible extensions <math>\\mathfrak{X}/\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>? If our variety is a curve, then the vanishing <math>H^2</math> implies that every deformation induces a variety over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>; that is, if we have a smooth curve\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nand a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2))\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthen we can always extend it to a diagram of the form\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_3 & \\to \\cdots \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow &  \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2)) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^3)) & \\to \\cdots\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nThis implies that we can construct a formal scheme <math>\\mathfrak{X} = \\operatorname{Spet}(\\mathfrak{X}_\\bullet)</math> giving a curve over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>.\n=== Deformations of abelian schemes ===\n\nThe [[Serre\u2013Tate theorem]] asserts, roughly speaking, that the deformations of [[abelian variety|abelian scheme]] ''A'' is controlled by deformations of the [[p-divisible group|''p''-divisible group]] <math>A[p^\\infty]</math> consisting of its ''p''-power torsion points.\n\n=== Galois deformations ===\nAnother application of deformation theory is with Galois deformations. It allows us to answer the question: If we have a Galois representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{F}_p)</math>\nhow can we extend it to a representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z}_p) \\text{?}</math>\n\n==Relationship to string theory==\nThe so-called [[Deligne conjecture]] arising in the context of algebras (and [[Hochschild cohomology]]) stimulated much interest in deformation theory in relation to [[string theory]] (roughly speaking, to formalise the idea that a string theory can be regarded as a deformation of a point-particle theory). This is now accepted as proved, after some hitches with early announcements. [[Maxim Kontsevich]] is among those who have offered a generally accepted proof of this.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dual number]]\n*[[Exalcomm]]\n* [[Cotangent complex]]\n* [[Gromov\u2013Witten invariant]]\n* [[Moduli of algebraic curves]]\n* [[Degeneration (algebraic geometry)]]\n\n==References==\n===Pedagogical===\n*Palamodov, V.

The infinitesimal conditions are therefore the result of applying the approach of [[differential calculus]] to solving a problem with [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. One might  think, in analogy, of a structure that is not completely rigid, and that deforms slightly to accommodate forces applied from the outside; this explains the name.\n\nSome characteristic phenomena are: the derivation of first-order equations by treating the \u03b5 quantities as having negligible squares; the possibility of ''isolated solutions'', in that varying a solution may not be possible, ''or'' does not bring anything new; and the question of whether the infinitesimal constraints actually 'integrate', so that their solution does provide small variations. In some form these considerations have a history of centuries in mathematics, but also in [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. For example, in the [[geometry of numbers]] a class of results called ''isolation theorems'' was recognised, with the topological interpretation of an ''open orbit'' (of a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]) around a given solution. [[Perturbation theory]] also looks at deformations, in general of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s.\n\n==Deformations of complex manifolds==\nThe most salient deformation theory in mathematics has been that of [[complex manifold]]s and [[algebraic varieties]]. This was put on a firm basis by foundational work of [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[Donald C. Spencer]], after deformation techniques had received a great deal of more tentative application in the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. One expects, intuitively, that deformation theory of the first order should equate the [[Zariski tangent space]] with a [[moduli space]]. The phenomena turn out to be rather subtle, though, in the general case.\n\nIn the case of [[Riemann surface]]s, one can explain that the complex structure on the [[Riemann sphere]] is isolated (no moduli). For genus 1, an [[elliptic curve]] has a one-parameter family of complex structures, as shown in [[elliptic function]] theory. The general Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory identifies as the key to the deformation theory the [[sheaf cohomology]] group\n\n: <math> H^1(\\Theta) \\, </math>\n\nwhere \u0398 is (the sheaf of [[Germ (mathematics)|germs]] of sections of) the holomorphic [[tangent bundle]]. There is an obstruction in the ''H''<sup>2</sup> of the same sheaf; which is always zero in case of a curve, for general reasons of dimension. In the case of genus 0 the ''H''<sup>1</sup> vanishes, also. For genus 1 the dimension is the [[Hodge number]] ''h''<sup>1,0</sup> which is therefore 1.  It is known that all curves of genus one have equations of form ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''.  These obviously depend on two parameters, a and b, whereas the isomorphism classes of such curves have only one parameter.  Hence there must be an equation relating those a and b which describe isomorphic elliptic curves.  It turns out that curves for which ''b''<sup>2</sup>''a''<sup>\u22123</sup> has the same value, describe isomorphic curves.  I.e. varying a and b is one way to deform the structure of the curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b'', but not all variations of ''a,b'' actually change the isomorphism class of the curve.\n\nOne can go further with the case of genus ''g'' > 1, using [[Serre duality]] to relate the  ''H''<sup>1</sup> to\n\n: <math> H^0(\\Omega^{[2]}) </math>\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the holomorphic [[cotangent bundle]] and the notation \u03a9<sup>[2]</sup> means the ''tensor square'' (''not'' the second [[exterior power]]). In other words, deformations are regulated by holomorphic [[quadratic differential]]s on a Riemann surface, again something known classically. The dimension of the moduli space, called [[Teichm\u00fcller space]] in this case, is computed as 3''g'' &minus; 3, by the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]].\n\nThese examples are the beginning of a theory applying to holomorphic families of complex manifolds, of any dimension. Further developments included: the extension by Spencer of the techniques to other structures of [[differential geometry]]; the assimilation of the Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory into the abstract algebraic geometry of [[Grothendieck]], with a consequent substantive clarification of earlier work; and deformation theory of other structures, such as algebras.\n\n==Functorial description==\nAnother method for formalizing deformation theory is using functors on the category <math>\\text{Art}_k</math> of local Artin algebras over a field. A '''pre-deformation functor''' is defined as a functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Art}_k \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nsuch that <math>F(k)</math> is a point. The idea is that we want to study the infinitesimal structure of some [[moduli space]] around a point where lying above that point is the space of interest. It is typically the case that it is easier to describe the functor for a moduli problem instead of finding an actual space. For example, if we want to consider the moduli-space of hypersurfaces of degree <math>d</math> in <math>\\mathbb{P}^n</math>, then we could consider the functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Sch} \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\nF(S) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\nS\n\\end{matrix}\n: \\text{ each fiber is a degree } d \\text{ hypersurface in }\\mathbb{P}^n\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nAlthough in general, it is more convenient/required to work with functors of [[groupoid|groupoids]] instead of sets. This is true for moduli of curves.\n\n===Technical remarks about infinitesimals===\nInfinitesimals have long been in use by mathematicians for non-rigorous arguments in calculus. The idea is that if we consider polynomials <math>F(x,\\varepsilon)</math> with an infinitesimal <math>\\varepsilon</math>, then only the first order terms really matter; that is, we can consider\n:<math> F(x,\\varepsilon) \\equiv f(x) + \\varepsilon g(x) + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nA simple application of this is that we can find the derivatives of [[monomial|monomials]] using infinitesimals:\n:<math> (x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nthe <math>\\varepsilon</math> term contains the derivative of the monomial, demonstrating its use in calculus. We could also interpret this equation as the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of the monomial. Infinitesimals can be made rigorous using nilpotent elements in local artin algebras. In the ring <math>k[y]/(y^2)</math> we see that arguments with infinitesimals can work. This motivates the notation <math>k[\\varepsilon] = k[y]/(y^2)</math>, which is called the [[Ring of dual numbers]]. \n\nMoreover, if we want to consider higher-order terms of a taylor approximation then we could consider the artin algebras <math>k[y]/(y^k)</math>. For our monomial, suppose we want to write out the second order expansion, then\n:<math>(x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + 3x\\varepsilon^2 + \\varepsilon^3</math>\nRecall that a Taylor expansion (at zero) can be written out as\n:<math>f(x) = f(0) + \\frac{f^{(1)}(x)}{1!} + \\frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!} + \\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!} + \\cdots </math>\nhence the previous two equations show that the second derivative of <math>x^3</math> is <math>6x</math>.\n\nIn general, since we want to consider arbitrary order Taylor expansions in any number of variables, we will consider the category of all local artin algebras over a field.\n\n===Motivation===\nTo motivative the definition of a pre-deformation functor, consider the projective hypersurface over a field\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nIf we want to consider an infinitesimal deformation of this space, then we could write down a Cartesian square\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{ \\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3][\\varepsilon]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 + \\varepsilon  x_0^{a_0} x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} x_3^{a_3}) } \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow\\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 4</math>. Then, the space on the right hand corner is one example of an infinitesimal deformation: the extra scheme theoretic structure of the nilpotent elements in <math>\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])</math> (which is topologically a point) allows us to organize this infinitesimal data. Since we want to consider all possible expansions, we will let our predeformation functor be defined on objects as\n:<math>\nF(A) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n</math>\nwhere <math>A</math> is a local Artin <math>k</math>-algebra.\n\n===Smooth pre-deformation functors===\nA pre-deformation functor is called '''smooth''' if for any surjection <math>A' \\to A</math> such that the square of any element in the kernel is zero, there is a surjection\n:<math>F(A') \\to F(A)</math>\nThis is motivated by the following question: given a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\ndoes there exist an extension of this cartesian diagram to the cartesian diagrams\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}' \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A')\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthe name smooth comes from the lifting criterion of a smooth morphism of schemes.\n\n===Tangent space===\nRecall that the tangent space of a scheme <math>X</math> can be described as the <math>\\operatorname{Hom}</math>-set\n:<math>TX := \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\text{Sch}/k}(\\operatorname{Spec}(k[x]),X)</math>\nSince we are considering the tangent space of a point of some moduli space, we can define the tangent space of our (pre)-deformation functor as\n:<math>T_F := F(k[\\varepsilon])</math>\n\n== Applications of deformation theory ==\n=== Bend-and-break ===\nDeformation theory was famously applied in [[birational geometry]] by [[Shigefumi Mori]] to study the existence of [[rational curve]]s on [[algebraic variety|varieties]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Olivier|last = Debarre | author-link = Olivier Debarre|  title = Higher-Dimensional Algebraic Geometry|year = 2001 | publisher= Springer| chapter = 3.

Tanjiro is a teenager who goes on a quest to restore the humanity of his sister, [[Nezuko Kamado|Nezuko]], who was turned into a demon after his family was killed by Muzan Kibutsuji. After an encounter with [[Giyu Tomioka]], a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyu to also become a demon slayer to help his sister turn human again and avenge his family. Besides the ''Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba'' [[anime]] adaptation, Tanjiro has also appeared in a [[light novel]] that acts as a prequel to the manga.\n \nKoyoharu Got\u014dge created Tanjiro following a suggestion from his editor of having a bright main character who would stand out in his dark narrative. His design influenced by [[Himura Kenshin]] from [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' when deciding how andrognynous the character should look. In the anime series, Tanjiro is voiced by [[Natsuki Hanae]] in Japanese and Zach Aguilar in English. The character has been well received by manga and anime critics due to his caring nature and relationship with his sister, winning multiple awards based on his popularity.\n\n==Creation and design==\n[[File:NezukoTanjiroearlysketch.jpg|thumb|left|Early sketches of Nezuko and Tanjiro]]\nTanjiro Kamado originates from Koyoharu Got\u014dge's ideas involving a one-shot with Japanese motifs. Tatsuhiko Katayama, his editor, was worried about the one-shot being too dark for the young demographic and asked Got\u014dge if he could write another type of main character who would be \"brighter\".<ref name=\"creation\">{{cite web|url=https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/web_pages/234/|title=The birth of \"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\"|publisher=Shueisha|website=Manga Plus|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> Got\u014dge has cited issues in the making of the character due to the contrast he has with the dark narrative. For the release of the manga's seventh chapter, Got\u014dge drew a cover of Tanjiro wielding his sword while smiling. However, due to the constrating aesthetics the manga had. As a result, Got\u014dge discarded the drawing and instead drew a similar design with Tanjiro having a serious expression.<ref>{{cite book|title=Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba|volume=2|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-9747-0053-0|year=2018|author=Got\u014dge, Koyoharu}}</ref>\n\nIn the initial design, Tanjiro did not have a scar or wear earrings, but in the end they felt these features really accentuated the character. In the making of the cast, Tanjiro had four supporting characters who would balance each other due to their different skills. The editor commented about Tanjiro, \"[He] is a type of male main character that you don't really see much. He's so kind. He has Nezuko, so he's coming from this position where he can't just say all demons are absolute evil. He's in the gray zone.\" Tanjiro's design was also influenced by Got\u014dge's editor: He suggested giving Tanjiro a facial scar in his forehead inspired by [[Himura Kenshin]] from [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' while also giving him earrings in order to balance how androgynous he would look.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nYuma Takahashi, the producer behind the adaptation of the manga said he enjoyed Tanjiro's role in the manga, making him engaged in reading the series. For how Tanjiro's Water Breathing was portrayed, [[Ufotable]] received inspiration from [[Katsushika Hokusai]]'s [[ukiyo-e]] style. The first fight scene between Tanjiro and Giyu was also carefully animated to give viewers an appealing choreography.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/es-es/anime-feature/2019/08/16/yuma-takahashi-talks-about-producing-one-of-animes-biggest-hits?referrer=community_cr_twitter_news|title=Yuma Takahashi Talks About Producing One of Anime's Biggest Hits!|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> Tanjiro's water-based techniques were created using a mix between hand-drawn animation and CGI, while his battle against Rui was one of the most worked scenes in the making. Takahashi also said that Tanjiro is his most relatable character from the series due to how his constant hard work inspires him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2019-08-28/interview-demon-slayer-producer-yuma-takahashi/.149177|title=Interview: Demon Slayer producer Yuma Takahashi|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhen the anime series premiered in China, Tanjiro's design was sightly altered. Due to his piercings having Rising Sun style elements, it was feared it would offend the Mainland leading to brief retouches to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/anime-demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-changed-slightly-a-1833879190|title=Anime Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Changed Slightly In China As Not To Offend|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice actors ===\nTanjiro has been voiced by [[Natsuki Hanae]] in Japanese. Hanae noted that multiple response to his career involved him portraying sad characters. However, in Tanjiro's case, he said Tanjiro is on the easy side because he says what he thinks, and is not the type that thinks one way and other things. Nezuko's actress, [[Akari Kit\u014d]], said Hanae is like a big brother to her at the studio, supportive and if there are parts she has difficulty recording, Hanae would stay and wait till she finishes even though his part has finished. Hanae said she also thinks of Kit\u014d as a younger sister. He also says it is easier for him to do his best when he is around people who he is friendly with.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/comic/pp/kimetsu|title=\u300c\u9b3c\u6ec5\u306e\u5203\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f|publisher=Ntalie|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEnglish voice actor Zach Aguilar was overjoyed when being given the role of voicing Tanjiro in the dub due to him being a fan of the series, as well as noting he was supported by multiple fans.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Zach Aguilar|user=airzach\n|number=1182014282487042048 |date=October 9, 2019 |title=Incredibly honored by this - I\u2019m voicing Tanjiro for the English dub of Demon Slayer!

His skull is extremely thick and his headbutts are often used as gags throughout the series. He is a kind-hearted boy and often feels sympathy for demons and their victims. His endless optimism and simple nature often has people enjoy his company, but at the same time, it also puts him at odds with certain personalities. Tanjiro has a heightened sense of smell which allows him to track down demons and evade their attacks. His sword's color is black, occasionally turning crimson red and becoming much stronger when combined with Nezuko's Blood Burst, a technique he later learns to perform without her help.\n\nA [[light novel]] entitled ''Demon Slayer: Flower of Happiness'' chronicles the lives of Tanjiro and Zenitsu before the start of the main series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kimetsu.com/news/?id=49766|script-title=ja:\u300c\u9b3c\u6ec5\u306e\u5203\u300d\u516c\u5f0f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|website=kimetsu.com|url-status=live|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Merchandising based on Tanjiro has also been released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otakuusamagazine.com/posable-demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-figure-can/|title=Posable Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Figure Can Do It All|website=Otaku USA|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otakuusamagazine.com/sony-demon-slayer-yaiba-walkman/|title=Sony Releases Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Walkman, Headphones|website=Otaku USA|access-date=February 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical===\nCritical reception to Tanjiro's character has been positive ever since his introduction.

Tanjiro is a teenager who goes on a quest to restore the humanity of his sister, [[Nezuko Kamado|Nezuko]], who was turned into a demon after his family was killed by Muzan Kibutsuji. After an encounter with [[Giyu Tomioka]], a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyu to also become a demon slayer to help his sister turn human again and avenge his family. Besides the ''Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba'' [[anime]] adaptation, Tanjiro has also appeared in a [[light novel]] that acts as a prequel to the manga.\n \nKoyoharu Got\u014dge created Tanjiro following a suggestion from his editor of having a bright main character who would stand out in his dark narrative. His design influenced by [[Himura Kenshin]] from [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' when deciding how andrognynous the character should look. In the anime series, Tanjiro is voiced by [[Natsuki Hanae]] in Japanese and Zach Aguilar in English. The character has been well received by manga and anime critics due to his caring nature and relationship with his sister, winning multiple awards based on his popularity.\n\n==Creation and design==\n[[File:NezukoTanjiroearlysketch.jpg|thumb|left|Early sketches of Nezuko and Tanjiro]]\nTanjiro Kamado originates from Koyoharu Got\u014dge's ideas involving a one-shot with Japanese motifs. Tatsuhiko Katayama, his editor, was worried about the one-shot being too dark for the young demographic and asked Got\u014dge if he could write another type of main character who would be \"brighter\".<ref name=\"creation\">{{cite web|url=https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/web_pages/234/|title=The birth of \"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\"|publisher=Shueisha|website=Manga Plus|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> Got\u014dge has cited issues in the making of the character due to the contrast he has with the dark narrative. For the release of the manga's seventh chapter, Got\u014dge drew a cover of Tanjiro wielding his sword while smiling. However, due to the constrating aesthetics the manga had. As a result, Got\u014dge discarded the drawing and instead drew a similar design with Tanjiro having a serious expression.<ref>{{cite book|title=Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba|volume=2|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-9747-0053-0|year=2018|author=Got\u014dge, Koyoharu}}</ref>\n\nIn the initial design, Tanjiro did not have a scar or wear earrings, but in the end they felt these features really accentuated the character. In the making of the cast, Tanjiro had four supporting characters who would balance each other due to their different skills. The editor commented about Tanjiro, \"[He] is a type of male main character that you don't really see much. He's so kind. He has Nezuko, so he's coming from this position where he can't just say all demons are absolute evil. He's in the gray zone.\" Tanjiro's design was also influenced by Got\u014dge's editor: He suggested giving Tanjiro a facial scar in his forehead inspired by [[Himura Kenshin]] from [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' while also giving him earrings in order to balance how androgynous he would look.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nYuma Takahashi, the producer behind the adaptation of the manga said he enjoyed Tanjiro's role in the manga, making him engaged in reading the series. For how Tanjiro's Water Breathing was portrayed, [[Ufotable]] received inspiration from [[Katsushika Hokusai]]'s [[ukiyo-e]] style. The first fight scene between Tanjiro and Giyu was also carefully animated to give viewers an appealing choreography.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/es-es/anime-feature/2019/08/16/yuma-takahashi-talks-about-producing-one-of-animes-biggest-hits?referrer=community_cr_twitter_news|title=Yuma Takahashi Talks About Producing One of Anime's Biggest Hits!|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> Tanjiro's water-based techniques were created using a mix between hand-drawn animation and CGI, while his battle against Rui was one of the most worked scenes in the making. Takahashi also said that Tanjiro is his most relatable character from the series due to how his constant hard work inspires him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2019-08-28/interview-demon-slayer-producer-yuma-takahashi/.149177|title=Interview: Demon Slayer producer Yuma Takahashi|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhen the anime series premiered in China, Tanjiro's design was sightly altered.

Hanae noted that multiple response to his career involved him portraying sad characters. However, in Tanjiro's case, he said Tanjiro is on the easy side because he says what he thinks, and is not the type that thinks one way and other things. Nezuko's actress, [[Akari Kit\u014d]], said Hanae is like a big brother to her at the studio, supportive and if there are parts she has difficulty recording, Hanae would stay and wait till she finishes even though his part has finished. Hanae said she also thinks of Kit\u014d as a younger sister. He also says it is easier for him to do his best when he is around people who he is friendly with.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/comic/pp/kimetsu|title=\u300c\u9b3c\u6ec5\u306e\u5203\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f|publisher=Ntalie|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEnglish voice actor Zach Aguilar was overjoyed when being given the role of voicing Tanjiro in the dub due to him being a fan of the series, as well as noting he was supported by multiple fans.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Zach Aguilar|user=airzach\n|number=1182014282487042048 |date=October 9, 2019 |title=Incredibly honored by this - I\u2019m voicing Tanjiro for the English dub of Demon Slayer!

His skull is extremely thick and his headbutts are often used as gags throughout the series. He is a kind-hearted boy and often feels sympathy for demons and their victims. His endless optimism and simple nature often has people enjoy his company, but at the same time, it also puts him at odds with certain personalities. Tanjiro has a heightened sense of smell which allows him to track down demons and evade their attacks. His sword's color is black, occasionally turning crimson red and becoming much stronger when combined with Nezuko's Blood Burst, a technique he later learns to perform without her help.\n\nA [[light novel]] entitled ''Demon Slayer: Flower of Happiness'' chronicles the lives of Tanjiro and Zenitsu before the start of the main series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kimetsu.com/news/?id=49766|script-title=ja:\u300c\u9b3c\u6ec5\u306e\u5203\u300d\u516c\u5f0f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|website=kimetsu.com|url-status=live|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Merchandising based on Tanjiro has also been released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otakuusamagazine.com/posable-demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-figure-can/|title=Posable Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Figure Can Do It All|website=Otaku USA|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otakuusamagazine.com/sony-demon-slayer-yaiba-walkman/|title=Sony Releases Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Walkman, Headphones|website=Otaku USA|access-date=February 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical===\nCritical reception to Tanjiro's character has been positive ever since his introduction.

Donna, believing that they are being fooled decides to dig a little deeper into the death of Jughead. At school, Cheryl creates a locker memorial for Jughead which makes Betty emotional. She runs to the music room, followed by Archie and they kiss. Cheryl tells Veronica; who angrily confronts them in the lounge. Donna follows Betty into Dilton\u2019s bunker that night to find her and Archie kissing. Knowing that Donna was following her, she hid a very alive Jughead under the cot as a diversion so Bret and Donna would crack under pressure. At home, Betty and Archie flirtatiously text and Hermosa finds evidence about Donna\u2019s identity to help take-down the Stonewall kids.\n | LineColor       = 5B94F6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber   = 73\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n | Title           = Chapter Seventy-Three: The Locked Room\n | DirectedBy      = Tessa Blake\n | WrittenBy       = Aaron Allen\n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|11}}\n | ProdCode        = T13.21866\n | Viewers         = 0.66<ref name=\"4.16\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-11-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Wednesday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.11.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 12, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n | ShortSummary    = Jughead and Betty hold a locked room with the Stonewall kids and Mr. DuPont, explaining all. Mr. Chipping killed himself out of guilt as he orchestrated each student to commit the perfect murder. Whoever was assigned the ghostwriter job, would write their murder. Moose was supposed to be the murdered student. Betty and Jughead deduce that all four students had a hand in killing Jughead. Charles ordered the trio to burn their clothes and all evidence while he took Jughead in for injuries. Betty brings in Charles, FP, and Forsythe. Forsythe has been living in hiding, trying to prove Mr. DuPont murdered his original literary circle. Jughead was bait to lure out Forsythe so Mr. DuPont could finish the murder. DuPont kills himself to avoid jail, Joan leaves the country. Brett reveals the location of the tapes, while he faces charges. Betty blackmails Donna into disappearing, figuring out Donna's grandmother was murdered by DuPont, making her the mastermind behind everything. Betty starts to realize she might have feelings for Archie. FP and Forsythe begin talking. Veronica and Betty promise to tutor the guys so they can graduate together. \n | LineColor       = 5B94F6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber   = 74\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 17\n | Title           = [[Chapter Seventy-Four: Wicked Little Town]]\n | DirectedBy      = Antonio Negret\n | WrittenBy       = Tessa Leigh Williams\n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|15}}\n | ProdCode        = T13.21867\n | Viewers         = \n | ShortSummary    = Residents of Riverdale receive more videotapes of their houses. Kevin wants to sing a song from the musical, Hedwig, at the school's Variety Show. Archie and the gang decide to sing as a band, however, Principal Honey believes the show to be too inappropriate. Hiram has been skipping his appointments which leads to him collapsing. Betty tutors Jughead, who is not taking it seriously and investigating the videotapes. Cheryl and Toni devise a plan to try to get Honey to accept the show, but he denies, threatening to ban students from Senior Prom. After a peaceful protest, Honey cancels the Variety Show. Veronica and Archie fight over Hiram going to the gym, just as Betty and Jughead fight over him taking school seriously. Only Archie and Betty show up to rehearsal, and they end up kissing. Later, Veronica and Jughead apologize for their blowup, as Betty and Archie look at each other nervously from their windows. Veronica hosts the Variety Show at Le Bonne Nuit and the Archies perform there. Watching the tapes, Jughead sees a person tied up wearing a Jughead face mask who is brutally murdered by a woman in a Betty face mask.\n | LineColor       = 5B94F6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber   = 75\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 18\n | Title           = Chapter Seventy-Five: Lynchian\n | RTitle          = <ref name=\"EP17-19EPTitles\">{{cite web|url=https://decider.com/2019/07/23/riverdale-season-4-episode-titles-air-dates-trailers/|title='Riverdale' Season 4: Here's What We Know, Episode by Episode|work=Decider|date= Jul 23, 2019|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n | DirectedBy      = [[Steven A.
