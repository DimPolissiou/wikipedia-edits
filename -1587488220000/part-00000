The two-axis design eliminates the second planetary gearset (\"motor speed reduction device\") found in the 2010\u20132015 Prius and the Prius c, and which reduces the width and weight of the eCVT and improves its overall efficiency.\n\nIt is based in [[Anj\u014d, Aichi|Anj\u014d]], near [[Nagoya]], [[Japan]].\nAnother major division is located in Okazaki.\n\nOther global locations:\nHeadquarters for Europe : AW Europe & AW Technical Center Europe which is located in [[Braine-l'Alleud]] (Belgium) for Research and Development and in [[Baudour]] (Belgium) for the re-manufacturing of automatic transmissions/transaxles and production of electronic products.\n\n==Aisin AI==\nAisin AI is an independent company under Aisin Seiki. It was spun off in July 1991, moving its headquarters to Nishio City. Aisin AI supplied only Toyota through 1996, when [[DaimlerChrysler]] and [[Isuzu]] began using their products. The company later began supplying products to other companies worldwide.\n\n==Aisin USA==\nAisin constructed a factory in the [[United States of America]] in 1986, with production beginning in 1989. This factory, in [[Seymour, Indiana]] has since been expanded and supplies components for [[Honda]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Mitsubishi Motors]], [[Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.|Nissan]] and [[Toyota]]. The company also operates in [[Marion, Illinois]].\n\nOn October 5, 2005, Aisin USA opened an {{convert|878|acre|km2|adj=on}} testing facility near [[Fowlerville, Michigan]]. Officially named FT Techno of America (FTTA), but known as Aisin's [[Fowlerville, Michigan|Fowlerville]] Proving Ground, the new venture is a member of the Aisin Group, a Tier One worldwide automotive components supplier with global sales of more than {{USD|15 billion}} in 2004. In Michigan, Aisin Group companies employ 554 associates, with annual payroll of {{USD|40 million}} and total investments of {{USD|102.7 million}}. FTTA is Aisin's fifth group company in Michigan. In 2009, the North American based division and companies were all placed under a newly created entity named Aisin World Corp. of America. Aisin World Corp. of America was structured so that Toyota Motors Corporation, Mitsui, and Hino Motors USA have majority ownership of the Aisin entities in North America. Aisin Automotive Castings, LLC. and other North American based Aisin companies operate as subsidiaries to Aisin World Corp. of America. \n\nThe new proving ground, Aisin's first in [[North America]], and third worldwide, is research and development based supporting test surfaces of various lengths and lane widths used to develop and evaluate a variety of Aisin products and applications, such as transmissions, brakes, drivetrains, and chassis and body systems and components.\n\n==IMRA America==\nIMRA America (Institut Minoru de Recherche Avanc\u00e9) was founded in 1990 in Ann Arbor, Michigan and has become a key member of a global set of companies anchored by the All AISIN Group of Japan. As an AISIN organization, IMRA America is dedicated to creative research and innovation leading to the development of essential technologies for future industrial use. To achieve this, IMRA America has assembled a team of top-notch researchers and engineers from many disciplines and regions, including some of the brightest talent offered by the international scientific community.\n\nThroughout the early 1990s, IMRA performed fundamental research on ultrafast fiber lasers. The scientific advancement gained from this research ultimately led to the development of IMRA\u2019s first commercial product in 1995, the Femtolite.  IMRA has continued to expand its research base, and transitioned into product development to serve several industrial markets--such as [[lithium-ion battery]] and biomedical application.\n\nToday, the company operates with strong product development and engineering competencies, high-volume manufacturing capability, and rigorous quality control benchmarked to industrial standards. As a key part of Aisin's R&D sector, IMRA\u2019s history reflects the successful implementation of breakthrough technologies into everyday life.\n\n==Alternative propulsion products==\nAisin Seiki Co products includes: \n* [[Front-wheel drive]] 2-motor hybrid system.\n* [[Drive shaft|Shaft rotor]] for [[Hybrid vehicle]]s.\n\n== Solar cells ==\nAisin Seiki has worked with [[Toyota Central R&D Labs]] Inc. to develop [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s (DSC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.epfl.ch/dyesolarcell |title=Dye solar cell |publisher=\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne |date=2013-05-03 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>\n\n== Sponsorship ==\n[[File:Hattori Racing Enterprise 2018 001.jpg|thumb|Moffitt's championship winning truck with sponsor Aisin on display in [[Japan]].]]\nThe company sponsors the [[Aisin SeaHorses Mikawa]], 5-time champion of Japan's top professional basketball league.\n\n=== NASCAR ===\nAisin AW currently sponsors [[Austin Hill]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series|Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series]] and [[NASCAR Xfinity Series|Xfinity Series]].

The two-axis design eliminates the second planetary gearset (\"motor speed reduction device\") found in the 2010\u20132015 Prius and the Prius c, and which reduces the width and weight of the eCVT and improves its overall efficiency.\n\nIt is based in [[Anj\u014d, Aichi|Anj\u014d]], near [[Nagoya]], [[Japan]].\nAnother major division is located in Okazaki.\n\nOther global locations:\nHeadquarters for Europe : AW Europe & AW Technical Center Europe which is located in [[Braine-l'Alleud]] (Belgium) for Research and Development and in [[Baudour]] (Belgium) for the re-manufacturing of automatic transmissions/transaxles and production of electronic products.\n\n==Aisin AI==\nAisin AI is an independent company under Aisin Seiki. It was spun off in July 1991, moving its headquarters to Nishio City. Aisin AI supplied only Toyota through 1996, when [[DaimlerChrysler]] and [[Isuzu]] began using their products. The company later began supplying products to other companies worldwide.\n\n==Aisin USA==\nAisin constructed a factory in the [[United States of America]] in 1986, with production beginning in 1989. This factory, in [[Seymour, Indiana]] has since been expanded and supplies components for [[Honda]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Mitsubishi Motors]], [[Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.|Nissan]] and [[Toyota]]. The company also operates in [[Marion, Illinois]].\n\nOn October 5, 2005, Aisin USA opened an {{convert|878|acre|km2|adj=on}} testing facility near [[Fowlerville, Michigan]]. Officially named FT Techno of America (FTTA), but known as Aisin's [[Fowlerville, Michigan|Fowlerville]] Proving Ground, the new venture is a member of the Aisin Group, a Tier One worldwide automotive components supplier with global sales of more than {{USD|15 billion}} in 2004. In Michigan, Aisin Group companies employ 554 associates, with annual payroll of {{USD|40 million}} and total investments of {{USD|102.7 million}}. FTTA is Aisin's fifth group company in Michigan. In 2009, the North American based division and companies were all placed under a newly created entity named Aisin World Corp. of America. Aisin World Corp. of America was structured so that Toyota Motors Corporation, Mitsui, and Hino Motors USA have majority ownership of the Aisin entities in North America. Aisin Automotive Castings, LLC. and other North American based Aisin companies operate as subsidiaries to Aisin World Corp. of America. \n\nThe new proving ground, Aisin's first in [[North America]], and third worldwide, is research and development based supporting test surfaces of various lengths and lane widths used to develop and evaluate a variety of Aisin products and applications, such as transmissions, brakes, drivetrains, and chassis and body systems and components.\n\n==Alternative propulsion products==\nAisin Seiki Co products includes: \n* [[Front-wheel drive]] 2-motor hybrid system.\n* [[Drive shaft|Shaft rotor]] for [[Hybrid vehicle]]s.\n\n== Solar cells ==\nAisin Seiki has worked with [[Toyota Central R&D Labs]] Inc. to develop [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s (DSC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.epfl.ch/dyesolarcell |title=Dye solar cell |publisher=\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne |date=2013-05-03 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>\n\n== Sponsorship ==\n[[File:Hattori Racing Enterprise 2018 001.jpg|thumb|Moffitt's championship winning truck with sponsor Aisin on display in [[Japan]].]]\nThe company sponsors the [[Aisin SeaHorses Mikawa]], 5-time champion of Japan's top professional basketball league.\n\n=== NASCAR ===\nAisin AW currently sponsors [[Austin Hill]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series|Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series]] and [[NASCAR Xfinity Series|Xfinity Series]].

Based on the [[fictional]] television network WHIH World News that appears throughout the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), the [[YouTube]] videos began as marketing for the film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'', and deal with major events depicted in the MCU's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series]]. The videos were created by Marvel Studios in partnership with [[Google]].\n\nThe [[news program]] features [[Leslie Bibb]] as [[Christine Everhart]], reprising her role from the MCU films, with [[Al Madrigal]] portraying political correspondent Will Adams. Several other actors reprise their roles from the films, while archival footage of others is also used. The initial videos were released during July 2015, focusing on the immediate aftermath of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' while leading up to the events of ''Ant-Man''. More were released beginning in April 2016 as a ''WHIH Newsfront Special Report'', focusing on the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the political issues surrounding them as part of a similar viral marketing campaign for the film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.\n\nThe videos are accompanied by additional marketing materials, such as in-universe web articles and social media posts. The series has been received positively, seen as better than average viral marketing campaigns, and as a fun and insightful expansion of the MCU for fans of the franchise.\n\n==Videos==\n\n===''Ant-Man'' campaign (2015)===\n{{see also|Ant-Man (film)}}\n{{Episode table |background=#1C1B6A|overall=6 |season=6 |title=50 |aux3=20 |airdate=12 |aux4=6 |country=US

When Marvel says \"It\u2019s All Connected\" they don\u2019t mess around; they really mean {{em|everything}}.\"<ref name=\"WHiHWorldNews\" /> Sean K. Cureton of Screen Rant found the videos to be \"in keeping with the willingness on the part of Marvel Studios to poke fun at some of the more vocal complaints frequently raised against the action-centric nature of the MCU, and the entire superhero film genre by default.

Based on the [[fictional]] television network WHIH World News that appears throughout the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), the [[YouTube]] videos began as marketing for the film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'', and deal with major events depicted in the MCU's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series]]. The videos were created by Marvel Studios in partnership with [[Google]].\n\nThe [[news program]] features [[Leslie Bibb]] as [[Christine Everhart]], reprising her role from the MCU films, with [[Al Madrigal]] portraying political correspondent Will Adams. Several other actors reprise their roles from the films, while archival footage of others is also used. The initial videos were released during July 2015, focusing on the immediate aftermath of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' while leading up to the events of ''Ant-Man''. More were released beginning in April 2016 as a ''WHIH Newsfront Special Report'', focusing on the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the political issues surrounding them as part of a similar viral marketing campaign for the film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.\n\nThe videos are accompanied by additional marketing materials, such as in-universe web articles and social media posts. The series has been received positively, seen as better than average viral marketing campaigns, and as a fun and insightful expansion of the MCU for fans of the franchise.\n\n==Videos==\n\n===''Ant-Man'' campaign (2015)===\n{{see also|Ant-Man (film)}}\n{{Episode table |background=#1C1B6A|overall=6 |season=6 |title=50 |aux3=20 |airdate=12 |aux4=6 |country=US

When Marvel says \"It\u2019s All Connected\" they don\u2019t mess around; they really mean {{em|everything}}.\"<ref name=\"WHiHWorldNews\" /> Sean K. Cureton of Screen Rant found the videos to be \"in keeping with the willingness on the part of Marvel Studios to poke fun at some of the more vocal complaints frequently raised against the action-centric nature of the MCU, and the entire superhero film genre by default. At the same time, in incorporating the real world dialogue regarding the ridiculous levels of structural damage inflicted on various metropolitan settings, [the franchise] sets itself apart through a coy flirtation in engaging the discussion.\"<ref name=\"SRReview\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"BibbReveal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/06/iron-man-actress-leslie-bibb-teases-return-to-the-marvel-cinematic-universe/ |title=Iron Man actress Leslie Bibb teases return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe |last=Garcia |first=James |publisher=Flickering Myth |date=June 25, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gyN7dRzc?url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/06/iron-man-actress-leslie-bibb-teases-return-to-the-marvel-cinematic-universe/ |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Promo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/07/leslie-bibbs-christine-everhart-returns-in-ant-man-viral-video-plus-new-featurette/ |title=Leslie Bibb\u2019s Christine Everhart returns in Ant-Man viral video, plus new featurette |last=Collinson |first=Gary |publisher=Flickering Myth |date=July 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gyNEUrZO?url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/07/leslie-bibbs-christine-everhart-returns-in-ant-man-viral-video-plus-new-featurette/ |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelRelease\">{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/24956/marvel_google_take_you_deeper_into_the_world_of_ant-man |title=Marvel & Google Take You Deeper Into the World of 'Ant-Man' |last=Strom |first=Marc |publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |date=July 31, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gyP5V6Kc?url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/24956/marvel_google_take_you_deeper_into_the_world_of_ant-man |archivedate=2016-04-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MashablePiece\">{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2015/07/16/whistle-blower-brandspeak/#.CmW8ylTukqn |title=Confessions of a whistleblower |publisher=[[Mashable]] |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gyPpwLVD?url=http://mashable.com/2015/07/16/whistle-blower-brandspeak/ |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SlashFilm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/ant-man-viral-backstory/ |title=\u2018Ant-Man\u2019 Viral: Interviews With Scott Lang and Pym Technologies CEO Darren Cross |last1=Fischer |first1=Ross |last2=Sciretta |first2=Peter |publisher=[[/Film]] |date=July 16, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gyRSgi4c?url=http://www.slashfilm.com/ant-man-viral-backstory/ |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IndieWireReview\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/viral-video-prequel-to-ant-man-sees-an-old-mcu-character-return-peyton-reed-hints-at-sequel-plot-20150717 |title=Viral Video Prequel To 'Ant-Man' Sees An Old MCU Character Return, Peyton Reed Hints At Sequel Plot |last=Lyttelton |first=Oliver |work=[[IndieWire]] |date=July 17, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gyRr6UKq?url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/viral-video-prequel-to-ant-man-sees-an-old-mcu-character-return-peyton-reed-hints-at-sequel-plot-20150717 |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Madrigal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/679359-whih-news-returns-for-civil-war-viral-video#/slide/1 |title=WHIH News Returns for Civil War Viral Video!
