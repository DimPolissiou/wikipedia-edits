Influenced by the Beat Generation his work crossed a number of genres including autobiography, beat lit and crime fiction.\n\n==Overview==\nDan Tur\u00e8ll grew up in [[Gentofte|Vangede]], which at that time was a town outside [[Copenhagen]] surrounded by fields; today it is a part of Greater Copenhagen. He died from [[esophageal cancer]]<ref>[http://www.dk4.dk/?p=plug-side-item;id=1666 dk4 - Udfordrende tv 24 timer i d\u00f8gnet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and is buried at [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]]. On Sunday March 19, 2006, on what would have been his 60th birthday, part of the town square of ''Halmtorvet'' in Copenhagen was named ''Onkel Dannys Plads'' (English: ''Uncle Danny's Square'') in Dan Tur\u00e8lls honour and remembrance.\n\nTur\u00e8ll was unruly, modern, and experimental when it came to both content and form. He might probably himself have claimed to let the form at all times be a consequence of an [[interaction]] between [[theme (literature)|theme]] and [[literature|subject]], which inevitably would lead to a flood of crossing [[genres]]; delightfully difficult to fit into a box.\n\nThere is often a touch of [[autobiography]], or perhaps rather [[self orchestration]], to his works. He was very conscious of his own image. Many will remember him for his black nail polish. Thus his major breakthrough was the autobiographical [[novel]], ''Vangede Billeder'' (English: ''Images of Vangede'') from 1975. He shares subjects with the American [[Beat generation|Beat poets]] (mainly [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Jack Kerouac]] & [[William S. Burroughs]]): [[jazz]], [[metropolis]], [[drugs]], and [[zen]]. He has an eye for the [[aesthetic]] [[dimensions]] of [[Decadence|decline]] and [[degeneration]], which he cultivates not least in his [[book series|series]] of [[crime novel]]s. Other recurring topics include [[Copenhagen]], [[Malta]], the teachings of [[Donald Duck]], icons of [[American culture]] and the [[Americanisation]], which the United States, for better or worse, had on Denmark.\n\nTur\u00e8ll loved [[Copenhagen|his city of Copenhagen]], its life, its noise and perhaps especially the little stories, that lurked everywhere. This love for the city is portrayed in many of his stories. It must be said, however, that his portrayal of [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] is considerably more romantic than the Vesterbro of [[real life]].\n\nTur\u00e8ll published quite a bit of his material himself, especially early in his career. He wrote in both [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[English language|English]] and has been translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]].\n\n==Bibliography==\nDan Tur\u00e8ll was a highly prolific writer, and this bibliography<ref>The bibliography of this article was researched by way of the following online resources: National Danish Online Library Database (https://bibliotek.dk), Danish Literature Centre (http://www.litteraturnet.dk) & The Tur\u00e8ll Collection (http://www.turellsamlingen.dk)</ref> is in no way complete. He has contributed to numerous anthologies in his time and collections of his works are still being published to this day. He has also written a vast number of articles and essays for newspapers and various magazines on countless subjects. His wrapsheet is breathtaking. Danish literary  critic and writer, [[Lars Bukdahl]], put it this way:<ref>In The Danish Literature Centre's biography of Dan Tur\u00e8ll; see direct link under ''External links''</ref> ''He only lived to the age of 47, and it is as though he knew he had to hurry.''\n\n===Cut-up literature===\n* ''Changes of Light'', 1970\n* ''Occult Confessions'', 1970\n* ''Speed of Light'', 1970.\n* ''Opsvulmede byer i sigtekornet flagrende skud i bevidstheden'' (English: ''Inflated Cities in the Sight Fluttering Shots in the Consciousness''), 1972.\n* ''Sidste forestilling bevidstl\u00f8se trancebilleder af eksploderende spejltricks igennem flyvende tidsmaskine af smeltende elektriske glasfotos'' (English: ''Last Performance of Unconscious Trance Images of Exploding Mirror Tricks through Flying Time Machine of Melting Electrical Glass Photos''), 1972\n* ''Feuilleton 1: Faraway Signs'' (English: ''Serial 1: Faraway Signs''), 1972\n* ''Feuilleton 2: Laser Time Switch'' (English: ''Serial 2: Laser Time Switch''), 1972\n* ''Feuilleton 3: Filmen synker igennem Deres \u00f8jne'' (English: ''Serial 3: The Film Sinks Through Your Eyes''), 1972\n* ''Feuilleton 4: The Edison Kinetogram'' (English: ''Serial 4: The Edison Kinetogram''), 1972\n* ''Feuilleton 5: It's Just Another Whistle Stop'' (English: ''Serial 5: It's Just Another Whistle Stop''), 1973\n* ''Feuilleton 6: Not Fade Away ...''

All twelve volumes follow the same protagonist, a nameless detective / reporter, a freelance writer for a fictitious Copenhagen newspaper, plainly called ''Bladet'' (English: ''The Paper''). In each novel the protagonist is hurled into a new murder mystery, often along recurring characters, centrally among them ''Politiinspekt\u00f8r Ehlers'' (English: ''Inspector Ehlers''). The stories are self contained, but [[setting (fiction)|settings]], relations, and [[fictional character|characters]] evolve as the series progress.\n\nThe series primarily takes place in an alternate version of the borough of Vesterbro in Copenhagen, which serves as a backdrop for considerably more criminal endeavours than real life will probably ever match. Also certain aspects of the city's geography has been altered. Certain streets lie differently, for instance.\n\n* ''Mord i m\u00f8rket'' (English: ''Murder in the Dark''), 1981\n* ''Mord i Rodby'' (English: ''Murder in Rodby''), 1981\n* ''Mord ved Runddelen'' (English: ''Murder by the Circle''), 1983\n* ''Mord p\u00e5 Malta'' (English: ''Murder on Malta''), 1983\n* ''Mord i marts'' (English: ''Murder in March''), 1984\n* ''Mord i september'' (English: ''Murder in September''), 1984\n* ''Mord i myldretiden'' (English: ''Murder during Rush Hour''), 1985\n* ''Mord p\u00e5 m\u00f8ntvaskeriet og andre kriminalhistorier'' (English: ''Murder in the Launderette and Other Crime Stories''), short stories, 1986\n* ''Mord i rendestenen'' (English: ''Murder in the Gutter''), 1987\n* ''Mord i Paradis'' (English: ''Murder in Paradise''), 1988\n* ''Mord p\u00e5 medierne'' (English: ''Murder on the Media''), 1988\n* ''Mord p\u00e5 markedet'' (English: ''Murder on the Market''), 1989\n* ''Mord i San Francisco'' (English: ''Murder in San Francisco''), 1989\n\n===Poetry===\n* ''Vibrationer'' (English: ''Vibrations''), 1966\n* ''40 ark'' (English: ''40 Sheets''), 1969\n* ''40 linier'' (English: ''40 Lines''), 1969\n* ''Manuskripter I: \u00d8jne/Further instructions'' (English: ''Manuscripts I: Eyes/Further Instructions''), 1970\n* ''Manuskripter II: Af beskrivelsen af det/Hvidt lys'' (English: ''Manuscripts II: From the Description of It/White Light''), 1970\n* ''Manuskripter om hvad som helst'' (English: ''Manuscripts about anything''), 1971.\n* ''Bev\u00e6gelser, form\u00e5lsl\u00f8st cirklende'' (English: ''Movements, pointlessly circling''), 1971\n* ''Dobbeltskrift'' (English: ''Double Writing''), 1973 - with [[Peter Laugesen]]\n* ''Onkel Danny's dadaistiske discjockey djellaba jazzjungle joysticks'' (English: ''Uncle Danny's Dadaistic Disc-Jockey Djellaba Jazz-Jungle Joysticks''), 1973\n* ''Sekvens af Manjana - den endel\u00f8se sang flimrende igennem hudens pupiller'' (English: ''Sequence of Manjana, the Endless Song Flickering through the Pupils of the Skin''), 1973\n* ''Lissom'' (English: ''Like''), 1973\n* ''Digte m. m.''

Influenced by the Beat Generation his work crossed a number of genres including autobiography, beat lit and crime fiction.\n\n==Overview==\nDan Tur\u00e8ll grew up in [[Gentofte|Vangede]], which at that time was a town outside [[Copenhagen]] surrounded by fields; today it is a part of Greater Copenhagen. He died from [[esophageal cancer]]<ref>[http://www.dk4.dk/?p=plug-side-item;id=1666 dk4 - Udfordrende tv 24 timer i d\u00f8gnet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and is buried at [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]]. On Sunday March 19, 2006, on what would have been his 60th birthday, part of the town square of ''Halmtorvet'' in Copenhagen was named ''Onkel Dannys Plads'' (English: ''Uncle Danny's Square'') in Dan Tur\u00e8lls honour and remembrance.\n\nTur\u00e8ll was unruly, modern, and experimental when it came to both content and form.

He was very conscious of his own image. Many will remember him for his black nail polish. Thus his major breakthrough was the autobiographical [[novel]], ''Vangede Billeder'' (English: ''Images of Vangede'') from 1975. He shares subjects with the American [[Beat generation|Beat poets]] (mainly [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Jack Kerouac]] & [[William S. Burroughs]]): [[jazz]], [[metropolis]], [[drugs]], and [[zen]]. He has an eye for the [[aesthetic]] [[dimensions]] of [[Decadence|decline]] and [[degeneration]], which he cultivates not least in his [[book series|series]] of [[crime novel]]s. Other recurring topics include [[Copenhagen]], [[Malta]], the teachings of [[Donald Duck]], icons of [[American culture]] and the [[Americanisation]], which the United States, for better or worse, had on Denmark.\n\nTur\u00e8ll loved [[Copenhagen|his city of Copenhagen]], its life, its noise and perhaps especially the little stories, that lurked everywhere. This love for the city is portrayed in many of his stories. It must be said, however, that his portrayal of [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] is considerably more romantic than the Vesterbro of [[real life]].\n\nTur\u00e8ll published quite a bit of his material himself, especially early in his career. He wrote in both [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[English language|English]] and has been translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]].\n\n==Bibliography==\nDan Tur\u00e8ll was a highly prolific writer, and this bibliography<ref>The bibliography of this article was researched by way of the following online resources: National Danish Online Library Database (https://bibliotek.dk), Danish Literature Centre (http://www.litteraturnet.dk) & The Tur\u00e8ll Collection (http://www.turellsamlingen.dk)</ref> is in no way complete. He has contributed to numerous anthologies in his time and collections of his works are still being published to this day. He has also written a vast number of articles and essays for newspapers and various magazines on countless subjects. His wrapsheet is breathtaking. Danish literary  critic and writer, [[Lars Bukdahl]], put it this way:<ref>In The Danish Literature Centre's biography of Dan Tur\u00e8ll; see direct link under ''External links''</ref> ''He only lived to the age of 47, and it is as though he knew he had to hurry.''\n\n===Cut-up literature===\n* ''Changes of Light'', 1970\n* ''Occult Confessions'', 1970\n* ''Speed of Light'', 1970.\n* ''Opsvulmede byer i sigtekornet flagrende skud i bevidstheden'' (English: ''Inflated Cities in the Sight Fluttering Shots in the Consciousness''), 1972.\n* ''Sidste forestilling bevidstl\u00f8se trancebilleder af eksploderende spejltricks igennem flyvende tidsmaskine af smeltende elektriske glasfotos'' (English: ''Last Performance of Unconscious Trance Images of Exploding Mirror Tricks through Flying Time Machine of Melting Electrical Glass Photos''), 1972\n* ''Feuilleton 1: Faraway Signs'' (English: ''Serial 1: Faraway Signs''), 1972\n* ''Feuilleton 2: Laser Time Switch'' (English: ''Serial 2: Laser Time Switch''), 1972\n* ''Feuilleton 3: Filmen synker igennem Deres \u00f8jne'' (English: ''Serial 3: The Film Sinks Through Your Eyes''), 1972\n* ''Feuilleton 4: The Edison Kinetogram'' (English: ''Serial 4: The Edison Kinetogram''), 1972\n* ''Feuilleton 5: It's Just Another Whistle Stop'' (English: ''Serial 5: It's Just Another Whistle Stop''), 1973\n* ''Feuilleton 6: Not Fade Away ...''

All twelve volumes follow the same protagonist, a nameless detective / reporter, a freelance writer for a fictitious Copenhagen newspaper, plainly called ''Bladet'' (English: ''The Paper''). In each novel the protagonist is hurled into a new murder mystery, often along recurring characters, centrally among them ''Politiinspekt\u00f8r Ehlers'' (English: ''Inspector Ehlers''). The stories are self contained, but [[setting (fiction)|settings]], relations, and [[fictional character|characters]] evolve as the series progress.\n\nThe series primarily takes place in an alternate version of the borough of Vesterbro in Copenhagen, which serves as a backdrop for considerably more criminal endeavours than real life will probably ever match. Also certain aspects of the city's geography has been altered. Certain streets lie differently, for instance.\n\n* ''Mord i m\u00f8rket'' (English: ''Murder in the Dark''), 1981\n* ''Mord i Rodby'' (English: ''Murder in Rodby''), 1981\n* ''Mord ved Runddelen'' (English: ''Murder by the Circle''), 1983\n* ''Mord p\u00e5 Malta'' (English: ''Murder on Malta''), 1983\n* ''Mord i marts'' (English: ''Murder in March''), 1984\n* ''Mord i september'' (English: ''Murder in September''), 1984\n* ''Mord i myldretiden'' (English: ''Murder during Rush Hour''), 1985\n* ''Mord p\u00e5 m\u00f8ntvaskeriet og andre kriminalhistorier'' (English: ''Murder in the Launderette and Other Crime Stories''), short stories, 1986\n* ''Mord i rendestenen'' (English: ''Murder in the Gutter''), 1987\n* ''Mord i Paradis'' (English: ''Murder in Paradise''), 1988\n* ''Mord p\u00e5 medierne'' (English: ''Murder on the Media''), 1988\n* ''Mord p\u00e5 markedet'' (English: ''Murder on the Market''), 1989\n* ''Mord i San Francisco'' (English: ''Murder in San Francisco''), 1989\n\n===Poetry===\n* ''Vibrationer'' (English: ''Vibrations''), 1966\n* ''40 ark'' (English: ''40 Sheets''), 1969\n* ''40 linier'' (English: ''40 Lines''), 1969\n* ''Manuskripter I: \u00d8jne/Further instructions'' (English: ''Manuscripts I: Eyes/Further Instructions''), 1970\n* ''Manuskripter II: Af beskrivelsen af det/Hvidt lys'' (English: ''Manuscripts II: From the Description of It/White Light''), 1970\n* ''Manuskripter om hvad som helst'' (English: ''Manuscripts about anything''), 1971.\n* ''Bev\u00e6gelser, form\u00e5lsl\u00f8st cirklende'' (English: ''Movements, pointlessly circling''), 1971\n* ''Dobbeltskrift'' (English: ''Double Writing''), 1973 - with [[Peter Laugesen]]\n* ''Onkel Danny's dadaistiske discjockey djellaba jazzjungle joysticks'' (English: ''Uncle Danny's Dadaistic Disc-Jockey Djellaba Jazz-Jungle Joysticks''), 1973\n* ''Sekvens af Manjana - den endel\u00f8se sang flimrende igennem hudens pupiller'' (English: ''Sequence of Manjana, the Endless Song Flickering through the Pupils of the Skin''), 1973\n* ''Lissom'' (English: ''Like''), 1973\n* ''Digte m. m.''

The leaves have irregular margins and are typically pinnately lobed or cut, looking somewhat like a [[lyre]]. The center vein is sometimes dark wine-purple. A square-shaped hairy stem up to {{convert|2|ft|m}} long grows from the rosette, with uneven whorls of two-lipped lavender to blue flowers. Flowering is heaviest between April and June, though sparse flowering can happen throughout the year.

The leaves have irregular margins and are typically pinnately lobed or cut, looking somewhat like a [[lyre]]. The center vein is sometimes dark wine-purple. A hairy stem up to {{convert|2|ft|m}} long grows from the rosette, with uneven whorls of two-lipped lavender to blue flowers. Flowering is heaviest between April and June, though sparse flowering can happen throughout the year. The leaves were once thought to be an external cure for cancer, thus one of the common names \"Cancerweed\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridata.com/ref/S/salv_lyr.cfm|title=Salvia lyrata|last=Duever|first=Linda Conway|publisher=Floridata|accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref> ''Salvia lyrata'' grows in full sun or light to medium shade, with native stands found on roadsides, fields, and open woodlands.<ref name=\"USDA\">{{cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/factsheet/pdf/fs_saly2.pdf|title=Lyreleaf Sage|work=USDA Plant Fact Sheet|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n''Salvia lyrata'' is sometimes grown in [[garden]]s for its attractive foliage and flowers, though it can prolifically seed, easily becoming a lawn weed.
