He graduated from [[Vestfyns Gymnasium]] in 1976 and has studied theology for short while. Rune T. Kidde was a multi-talented artist and has released both humorous cartoons, poems, novels, [[children's books]] and biographies. Additionally, he made [[radio|radio features]] to the Danish Children's Radio and was a [[folk singer]], poet and dramatic.\n \nRune T. Kidde was a prominent member of 1970s Danish cartoon underground. He published \"Fields'isten\" and fanzines such as \"Blomstrende Spaghetti\" (Flowering Spaghetti), \"Knulp\" and \"Kong Knud\" (King Canute). In 1977 he co-founded the publishing company Baldur og Brage who published the first Danish underground periodical with comics \"P\u00e5 Stribe\". In 1979 he co-founded the [[studio#Comics studio|cartoon studio]] [[Gimle (cartoons)|Gimle]] together with fellow cartoonist [[Peter Madsen (cartoonist)|Peter Madsen]] and in 1984 was a founding member of [[Tegneseriev\u00e6rkstedet]] (the comics workshop). Rune T. Kiddes own debut as cartoonist was the albums \"Rune T. Kidde\" and \"De siger s\u00e5 meget\" (They say so much) in 1980 and up through the 1980s he released a number of comics, as well as the illustrated handbook \"\u00d8ldrikkerens Lille Gr\u00f8nne\" (The Beer Drinker's Little Green \u2013 a pun on chairman [[Mao's Little Red Book]]).

In 1990 he lost his eyesight, which was difficult to combine with cartoon production. Still, Rune T.

During this time he worked with leading cartoonists such as [[Mort Walker]], [[Will Eisner]] and [[Gilbert Shelton]]. Throughout the 1980s he worked as an illustrator and writer for Danish newspapers and magazines such as ''[[Ekstrabladet]]'', ''[[Politiken]]'', ''[[Svikm\u00f8llen]]'', ''[[Euroman]]'' and many [[fanzines]].\n\n== Radio ==\nFrom 1990\u20132000 Kidde was a freelancer for [[Danmarks Radio]]s P1, P2 and P3.
