(1953). ''History of the University of Alabama, vol. 1 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 7</ref> The seminary was established by the [[Alabama Legislature|General Assembly]] on December 18, 1820, and named ''[[University of Alabama|The University of the State of Alabama]]''.  The legislature appointed a Board of Trustees to handle the building and opening of the campus, and its operation once complete.<ref>Sellers, James. B. (1953). ''History of the University of Alabama, vol. 1 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 8</ref>  The Board selected [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], then capital of Alabama, as the site of the university in 1827, and opened its doors to students on April 18, 1831. The land had been owned by William Marr,<ref>Sellers, James. B. (1953). ''History of the University of Alabama, vol. 1 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 30</ref> whose name is commemorated today in Marrs Spring and the literary Marrs Field Journal. A prominent [[architect]], Captain William Nichols, was commissioned to design the campus. An extensive [[vineyard]] was situated in the area of Denny Field and Barnwell Hall.\n\nMost of the material for the early buildings came from university land. Sandstone was quarried near the Black Warrior River, bricks were made locally and lumber came from the University's own timber tract. The work was hard and done by hand, and the University depended on the toil of enslaved workers. According to James Sellers' History of the University of Alabama, \"Much of the labor was, of course, performed by slaves\" but also noted \"the stonemasons, trained artisans of Scotch descent, built their pride of craft into the strength and beauty of the buildings they helped erect.<ref>Sellers, James. B. (1953) ''History of the University of Alabama, Vol.1 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 31</ref>\n\n== 1832\u201360: The frontier school ==\n\nThe board of trustees selected the Reverend Alva A. Woods to be the first president of the university.   Educated at [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Andover]], [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] and in Europe, Woods hoped to turn the university into a Harvard-style seminary.<ref>Sellers, James B. (1953) ''History of the University of Alabama, Vol. 1, 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 49</ref> This proved impossible. Though highly gifted, Woods was not equipped to deal with the discipline problems that came with young men from the frontier.<ref>Sellers, James B. ''History of the University of Alabama, Vol. 1, 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 57</ref>\n\nAdmission standards were set high.  Simply to enter the university, one had to demonstrate the ability to read [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] and [[Latin]] at an intermediate level, with advanced study in those languages to begin immediately.  But Alabama, a frontier state a sizable amount of whose territory was still under the control of various Native American tribes, was decades away from possessing the infrastructure necessary to provide adequate education (public or even private) to meet such high standards.\n\nThe university was consequently forced to admit many students who were not adequately prepared for university education.  For the duration of the Antebellum period, the university would graduate only a fraction of those young men who entered.  Of the 105 students who enrolled in 1835, only eight graduated. <!--(Wolfe 16)!-->\n\nWithin a month of the opening of the university, social societies emerged.  Unlike the social fraternities that would emerge in the next decade, these clubs were academic debate societies by nature.  The Erosophic Society was founded in May 1831, while the Philomathic Society came out eight months later.\n\nFor $80 a year, students received room and board at the Hotel, now known as the Gorgas House. Washington Hall and Jefferson Hall, called the \"colleges,\" stood three stories high. Each contained twelve apartments, which in turn contained two bedrooms and a sitting room. Forty-eight students resided in each [[dormitory]]. Madison and Franklin Halls were built later. Following the [[American Civil War]], the remains of Madison and Franklin Halls were made into memorial mounds. Madison Mound was removed during the 1920s, but Franklin Mound is still used for Honors Day ceremonies.  Additionally, an archaeological excavation, conducted in 2007, examined the remains of Washington and Jefferson Halls foundations.\n\nAt the center of the campus, where the Gorgas Library is now situated, stood the \"grande dame\" of the university, the Rotunda. In the 1894 yearbook, ''Corolla'', the building is described as \"a circular edifice of three stories, seventy feet in diameter and seventy feet in height, and surrounded by a lofty peristyle of the [[Ionic order]] of architecture. The principal story was used for chapel service and academic recitations. This department was long celebrated as being the finest auditorium in the State. In the second story was the circular gallery, supported by carved columns of the [[Corinthian order]]. The third story contained the library and the collections in natural history.\" The Rotunda was destroyed by fire and was never rebuilt. Following an [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] in 1985, the Rotunda's remains were cushioned in sand and covered with concrete to mark where the building had once stood.\n\nGreek life began at the university in 1847 when two young Mobilians visiting from [[Yale University|Yale]] installed a chapter of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]]. When DKE members began holding secret meetings in the old state capitol building that year, the administration strongly voiced its disapproval. Over the next decade, four other fraternities appeared at Alabama: [[Alpha Delta Phi]] in 1851, [[Phi Gamma Delta]] in 1855, [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] in 1856, and [[Kappa Sigma]] in 1857. Anti-fraternity laws were imposed in that year, but were lifted in 1890s. Eager to have a social organization of their own, women at the university founded the Zeta chapter of [[Kappa Delta]] sorority in 1903. [[Alpha Gamma Delta]] and [[Delta Delta Delta]] soon followed.\n\n== 1861\u20131902: The military school and beyond ==\n[[File:University of Alabama 1859.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|The campus of the University of Alabama in 1859. View of the Quad, with the Rotunda at center and dormitories in the background.]]\nStudent discipline remained a struggle.<ref>Sellers, James B. (1953) ''History of the University of Alabama, Vol. 1, 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 88</ref> In the 1850s, the school's president, [[Landon Garland]], began lobbying the Legislature to transform the university into a military school.  In 1860, in the wake a violent brawl which resulted in the death of student as well as the impending war, the legislature authorized Garland to make the transformation beginning in the Fall of 1860.  As a result of this transformation, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the school trained officers for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].\n\nBecause of this role, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops burned down the campus in April 1865. Only seven buildings survived the burning, one of which was the President's Mansion - and its outbuildings. Frances Louisa Garland, wife of President Landon C. Garland, saved the home from destruction by the Union soldiers. When she saw flames in the direction of the campus, she ran from the Bryce home where the family had taken refuge and demanded the soldiers put out the fire in the parlor. The university reopened in 1871 and shortly after, the military structure was dropped.  The other principal buildings today, have new uses.  Gorgas House (http://gorgashouse.ua.edu/), at different times the dining hall, faculty residence, and campus hotel, now serves as a museum. The Roundhouse, then a sentry box for cadets, later a place for records storage, is a campus historical landmark. The Observatory, now Maxwell Hall, is home to a program called Creative Campus\n\nIn 1880, the [[United States Congress]] granted the university 40,000 acres (160&nbsp;km\u00b2) of coal land as partial compensation for the $250,000 in war damages. Some of the money went toward the building of Manly and Clark Halls. In 1887, Clark became the home of the library, whose 7,000 volumes had been destroyed. It was not until 1900 that private donations, including the donation of 1,000 volumes collected by John Leslie Hibbard's father, restored the library to 20,000 books. Garland Hall, which housed the [[geology]] museum and lecture rooms, completed what became known as Woods Quad. Tuomey and Barnard Halls were also built before 1900.\n\nThe [[University of Alabama School of Medicine|medical school]] and pharmacy school were in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] at the time.<ref>{{cite book |title=Where to educate, 1898\u20131899.

In 1895, it was advertised that \"young women of good character, who have attained the age of eighteen, may be admitted to the university, provided they are prepared to take up subjects of study not lower than those of the Sophomore class. They must reside in private families; but rooms for study during the study-hours of the day are provided at The University.\"\n\n== 1903\u201340: The growing university==\n[[Image:Ua clark hall.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Clark Hall was rebuilt after the Civil War]]\n\nIn 1900 students fomented rebellion against the military system, leading to the resignations of the student commandant and university president James Knox Powers. In 1903 the state legislature abolished the military system that was proving so unpopular with students.\n\nIn celebration of the university's seventy-fifth anniversary in 1906, the Greater University fund-raising campaign began, spearheaded by alumni Hill Ferguson and Robert Jemison. The $5,000 which the campaign secured from the state legislature in 1909 went toward the building of Smith and Morgan Halls. Constructed of yellow [[Missouri]] brick with [[Indiana]] [[limestone]] trim, the buildings reflected the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Greek Revival]] style of architecture that was popular at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThe first years of the 20th century, when students had more freedom and the university was more established, saw the addition of a glee club, a drama club, a yearbook, and a student newspaper. One of the top female students, Helen Vickers, wrote the lyrics to UA's first alma mater. Female enrollment increased, and football became a passion.\n\n[[Image:George_H._Denny.png|left|thumb|200px|UA President George H. Denny, 1919 Corolla Yearbook]] \n[[Image:Denny_Chimes_by_Highsmith.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Denny Chimes, built in honor of President Denny]]\n\nOn January 1, 1912, the person who had the most influence on shaping The University of Alabama for decades to come began his tenure as president. Dr. George H. \"Mike\" Denny left the presidency of [[Washington and Lee University]] in Virginia to lead The University of Alabama through an unprecedented period of growth.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lacher-Feldman|first1=Jessica|title=The University of Alabama Trivia Book|date=2007|publisher=Hill Street Press|location=Athens, Ga.|isbn=978-1-58818-116-9|page=74}}</ref>\n\nDenny was known for his ability to make the most of limited funds in growing The University of Alabama, which he dubbed \"the Capstone\" of education in the state. His love for athletics, especially football, and his devotion to students earned him their loyalty and affection. In 1929, students raised money to build a bell tower on campus in his honor. Known as Denny Chimes, it is one of the most beloved icons for UA alumni and students.\n\nIn 1939, Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library opened its doors in the same spot where the Rotunda once stood. Half a century later, its long wooden tables and worn books smelling of dust and age contrasted with the grey computer catalogue terminals. Gorgas Library stood as a perfect symbol of the way, in all facets of the university, progress persisted amidst elements of the past.\n\n== 1941\u20131945: The university and WWII==\nFollowing America's entry into World War II in 1941, UA again became focused on training military members. Under the leadership of Dr. Raymond Ross Paty the university operated one of the largest military programs in the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolfe|first1=Suzanne Rau|title=The University of Alabama: A Pictorial History|date=1983|publisher=The University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa, Ala.|isbn=0-8173-0119-4|page=172}}</ref>\n\nThe University Club was converted into a servicemen's center, and female university students were hostesses to military members passing through Tuscaloosa, and to wounded GIs at Northington Hospital. During this time, few male students remained on campus, as enrollment dropped from nearly 5,000 in the fall of 1941 to 1,850 in spring of 1944. Students, faculty and alumni joined the war effort in either the armed forces or in a related civilian capacity.\n\nBy the end of the war, about 350 former students and one faculty member had died in combat or from other war-related causes. Of the dead, 13 had played on the Crimson Tide football team. One alumna, Janice Eloise Ford Beckwith, died while serving with the Red Cross in the Pacific.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reed|first1=Delbert|title=All of Us Fought the War: The University of Alabama and its Men and Women in WWII|date=2012|publisher=Paul W. Bryant Museum|location=Tuscaloosa, Ala.|isbn=0-615-69801-8|page=379}}</ref>\n\nWhile housing and educating nearly 13,000 soldiers and sailors created a strain on space and teaching resources, the university also grew in the areas of research, library facilities, and benefits for faculty and staff. The University of Alabama Press was founded, the medical school moved to Mobile, and the University Club was transferred to UA ownership. Dr. Paty resigned in December 1946, having led The University of Alabama through one of the hardest times in the history not just of UA, but of the nation.\n\n== 1946-2000: The university struggles and grows==\n\n[[Image:Vivian Malone registering.jpg|thumb|Malone registering for classes at University of Alabama]]\n\nIn 1953, [[Autherine Lucy]] sued in ''[[Lucy v. Adams]]'' to prevent the university from denying admission solely based on race or color.  Lucy became the first African-American to attend the school when she was admitted in 1956.  On the third day of classes, a hostile mob assembled to prevent Lucy from attending classes. The police were called to secure her admission but, that evening, the University suspended Lucy on the grounds that it could not provide a safe environment.  The university overturned her expulsion in 1980, and in 1992, Lucy earned her master's degree in elementary education from the university that she was admitted two decades earlier.<ref>{{cite news |author=Staff Writer |date=2006-02-26 |url=http://www.al.com/unseen/stories/index.ssf?cutlines4.html |title=Difficult Lessons&mdash;Desegregating the Schools, 1962\u20131963 |work=The Birmingham News |accessdate=2008-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071225024544/http://www.al.com/unseen/stories/index.ssf?cutlines4.html |archivedate=2007-12-25 }}</ref>\n\nOn June 11, 1963, Governor [[George Wallace]] attempted to prevent [[desegregation]] of that institution by blocking two [[African-American]] students, [[Vivian Malone Jones|Vivian Malone]] and [[James Hood]], from class registration at the University's [[Foster Auditorium]] in the \"[[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door]]\" incident.

A 40-foot-tall brick tower, with open arches and four large bronze plaques at its base, tells their stories.<ref>http://malonehoodplaza.ua.edu/</ref>\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the addition of several programs and schools, several of which had roots in long-established instructional programs. From 1965 to 1986 UA created the School of Social Work, the Computer-Based Honors Program, the Graduate School of Library Service, New College, the College of community Health Sciences, the School of Communication, the Capstone College of Nursing, the College of Continuing Studies, and the Honors College. The College of Continuing Studies began as the summer extension classes for teachers in 1904 and went through several iterations before becoming a college. The Graduate School of Library Service became the School of Library and Information Studies in 1989 before merging in 1997 with the College of Communications to become the College of Communication and Information Studies. https://www.ua.edu/about/history\n\n== 2001 to the present: The university in the 21st century ==\nIn 2001, total enrollment at The University of Alabama was 19,633. During the tenure of UA President Robert E. Witt, enrollment began climbing, and continued to climb through the presidencies of Dr. Guy Bailey, Dr. Judy Bonner and Dr. Stuart R. Bell. In 2017, enrollment was a record-breaking 38,563. The quality of the student body had also climbed, with 34 percent of the freshman class having a 4.0 grade point average in high school. https://www.ua.edu/about/quickfacts\n\nTo keep abreast of the growing student body, the UA campus added facilities ranging from residence halls to research laboratories and classroom buildings that seated 2,000. In 2010, UA reached an agreement with the state of Alabama's Mental Health Commission to purchase the former Bryce Hospital property, significantly expanding the northern side of campus.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Clark, E.

(1953). ''History of the University of Alabama, vol. 1 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 7</ref> The seminary was established by the [[Alabama Legislature|General Assembly]] on December 18, 1820, and named ''[[University of Alabama|The University of the State of Alabama]]''.  The legislature appointed a Board of Trustees to handle the building and opening of the campus, and its operation once complete.<ref>Sellers, James. B. (1953). ''History of the University of Alabama, vol. 1 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 8</ref>  The Board selected [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], then capital of Alabama, as the site of the university in 1827, and opened its doors to students on April 18, 1831. The land had been owned by William Marr,<ref>Sellers, James. B. (1953). ''History of the University of Alabama, vol. 1 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 30</ref> whose name is commemorated today in Marrs Spring and the literary Marrs Field Journal. A prominent [[architect]], Captain William Nichols, was commissioned to design the campus. An extensive [[vineyard]] was situated in the area of Denny Field and Barnwell Hall.\n\nMost of the material for the early buildings came from university land. Sandstone was quarried near the Black Warrior River, bricks were made locally and lumber came from the University's own timber tract. The work was hard and done by hand, and the University depended on the toil of enslaved workers. According to James Sellers' History of the University of Alabama, \"Much of the labor was, of course, performed by slaves\" but also noted \"the stonemasons, trained artisans of Scotch descent, built their pride of craft into the strength and beauty of the buildings they helped erect.<ref>Sellers, James. B. (1953) ''History of the University of Alabama, Vol.1 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 31</ref>\n\n== 1832\u201360: The frontier school ==\n\nThe board of trustees selected the Reverend Alva A. Woods to be the first president of the university.   Educated at [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Andover]], [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] and in Europe, Woods hoped to turn the university into a Harvard-style seminary.<ref>Sellers, James B. (1953) ''History of the University of Alabama, Vol. 1, 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 49</ref> This proved impossible. Though highly gifted, Woods was not equipped to deal with the discipline problems that came with young men from the frontier.<ref>Sellers, James B. ''History of the University of Alabama, Vol. 1, 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 57</ref>\n\nAdmission standards were set high.  Simply to enter the university, one had to demonstrate the ability to read [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] and [[Latin]] at an intermediate level, with advanced study in those languages to begin immediately.  But Alabama, a frontier state a sizable amount of whose territory was still under the control of various Native American tribes, was decades away from possessing the infrastructure necessary to provide adequate education (public or even private) to meet such high standards.\n\nThe university was consequently forced to admit many students who were not adequately prepared for university education.  For the duration of the Antebellum period, the university would graduate only a fraction of those young men who entered.  Of the 105 students who enrolled in 1835, only eight graduated. <!--(Wolfe 16)!-->\n\nWithin a month of the opening of the university, social societies emerged.  Unlike the social fraternities that would emerge in the next decade, these clubs were academic debate societies by nature.  The Erosophic Society was founded in May 1831, while the Philomathic Society came out eight months later.\n\nFor $80 a year, students received room and board at the Hotel, now known as the Gorgas House. Washington Hall and Jefferson Hall, called the \"colleges,\" stood three stories high. Each contained twelve apartments, which in turn contained two bedrooms and a sitting room. Forty-eight students resided in each [[dormitory]]. Madison and Franklin Halls were built later. Following the [[American Civil War]], the remains of Madison and Franklin Halls were made into memorial mounds. Madison Mound was removed during the 1920s, but Franklin Mound is still used for Honors Day ceremonies.  Additionally, an archaeological excavation, conducted in 2007, examined the remains of Washington and Jefferson Halls foundations.\n\nAt the center of the campus, where the Gorgas Library is now situated, stood the \"grande dame\" of the university, the Rotunda. In the 1894 yearbook, ''Corolla'', the building is described as \"a circular edifice of three stories, seventy feet in diameter and seventy feet in height, and surrounded by a lofty peristyle of the [[Ionic order]] of architecture. The principal story was used for chapel service and academic recitations. This department was long celebrated as being the finest auditorium in the State. In the second story was the circular gallery, supported by carved columns of the [[Corinthian order]]. The third story contained the library and the collections in natural history.\" The Rotunda was destroyed by fire and was never rebuilt. Following an [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] in 1985, the Rotunda's remains were cushioned in sand and covered with concrete to mark where the building had once stood.\n\nGreek life began at the university in 1847 when two young Mobilians visiting from [[Yale University|Yale]] installed a chapter of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]]. When DKE members began holding secret meetings in the old state capitol building that year, the administration strongly voiced its disapproval. Over the next decade, four other fraternities appeared at Alabama: [[Alpha Delta Phi]] in 1851, [[Phi Gamma Delta]] in 1855, [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] in 1856, and [[Kappa Sigma]] in 1857. Anti-fraternity laws were imposed in that year, but were lifted in 1890s. Eager to have a social organization of their own, women at the university founded the Zeta chapter of [[Kappa Delta]] sorority in 1903. [[Alpha Gamma Delta]] and [[Delta Delta Delta]] soon followed.\n\n== 1861\u20131902: The military school and beyond ==\n[[File:University of Alabama 1859.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|The campus of the University of Alabama in 1859. View of the Quad, with the Rotunda at center and dormitories in the background.]]\nStudent discipline remained a struggle.<ref>Sellers, James B. (1953) ''History of the University of Alabama, Vol. 1, 1818-1902''. University of Alabama Press, p. 88</ref> In the 1850s, the school's president, [[Landon Garland]], began lobbying the Legislature to transform the university into a military school.  In 1860, in the wake a violent brawl which resulted in the death of student as well as the impending war, the legislature authorized Garland to make the transformation beginning in the Fall of 1860.  As a result of this transformation, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the school trained officers for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].\n\nBecause of this role, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops burned down the campus in April 1865. Only seven buildings survived the burning, one of which was the President's Mansion - and its outbuildings. Frances Louisa Garland, wife of President Landon C. Garland, saved the home from destruction by the Union soldiers. When she saw flames in the direction of the campus, she ran from the Bryce home where the family had taken refuge and demanded the soldiers put out the fire in the parlor. The university reopened in 1871 and shortly after, the military structure was dropped.  The other principal buildings today, have new uses.  Gorgas House (http://gorgashouse.ua.edu/), at different times the dining hall, faculty residence, and campus hotel, now serves as a museum. The Roundhouse, then a sentry box for cadets, later a place for records storage, is a campus historical landmark. The Observatory, now Maxwell Hall, is home to a program called Creative Campus\n\nIn 1880, the [[United States Congress]] granted the university 40,000 acres (160&nbsp;km\u00b2) of coal land as partial compensation for the $250,000 in war damages. Some of the money went toward the building of Manly and Clark Halls. In 1887, Clark became the home of the library, whose 7,000 volumes had been destroyed. It was not until 1900 that private donations, including the donation of 1,000 volumes collected by John Leslie Hibbard's father, restored the library to 20,000 books. Garland Hall, which housed the [[geology]] museum and lecture rooms, completed what became known as Woods Quad. Tuomey and Barnard Halls were also built before 1900.\n\nThe [[University of Alabama School of Medicine|medical school]] and pharmacy school were in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] at the time.<ref>{{cite book |title=Where to educate, 1898\u20131899.

In 1895, it was advertised that \"young women of good character, who have attained the age of eighteen, may be admitted to the university, provided they are prepared to take up subjects of study not lower than those of the Sophomore class. They must reside in private families; but rooms for study during the study-hours of the day are provided at The University.\"\n\n== 1903\u201340: The growing university==\n[[Image:Ua clark hall.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Clark Hall was rebuilt after the Civil War]]\n\nIn 1900 students fomented rebellion against the military system, leading to the resignations of the student commandant and university president James Knox Powers. In 1903 the state legislature abolished the military system that was proving so unpopular with students.\n\nIn celebration of the university's seventy-fifth anniversary in 1906, the Greater University fund-raising campaign began, spearheaded by alumni Hill Ferguson and Robert Jemison. The $5,000 which the campaign secured from the state legislature in 1909 went toward the building of Smith and Morgan Halls. Constructed of yellow [[Missouri]] brick with [[Indiana]] [[limestone]] trim, the buildings reflected the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Greek Revival]] style of architecture that was popular at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThe first years of the 20th century, when students had more freedom and the university was more established, saw the addition of a glee club, a drama club, a yearbook, and a student newspaper. One of the top female students, Helen Vickers, wrote the lyrics to UA's first alma mater. Female enrollment increased, and football became a passion.\n\n[[Image:George_H._Denny.png|left|thumb|200px|UA President George H. Denny, 1919 Corolla Yearbook]] \n[[Image:Denny_Chimes_by_Highsmith.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Denny Chimes, built in honor of President Denny]]\n\nOn January 1, 1912, the person who had the most influence on shaping The University of Alabama for decades to come began his tenure as president. Dr. George H. \"Mike\" Denny left the presidency of [[Washington and Lee University]] in Virginia to lead The University of Alabama through an unprecedented period of growth.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lacher-Feldman|first1=Jessica|title=The University of Alabama Trivia Book|date=2007|publisher=Hill Street Press|location=Athens, Ga.|isbn=978-1-58818-116-9|page=74}}</ref>\n\nDenny was known for his ability to make the most of limited funds in growing The University of Alabama, which he dubbed \"the Capstone\" of education in the state. His love for athletics, especially football, and his devotion to students earned him their loyalty and affection. In 1929, students raised money to build a bell tower on campus in his honor. Known as Denny Chimes, it is one of the most beloved icons for UA alumni and students.\n\nIn 1939, Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library opened its doors in the same spot where the Rotunda once stood. Half a century later, its long wooden tables and worn books smelling of dust and age contrasted with the grey computer catalogue terminals. Gorgas Library stood as a perfect symbol of the way, in all facets of the university, progress persisted amidst elements of the past.\n\n== 1941\u20131945: The university and WWII==\nFollowing America\u2019s entry into World War II in 1941, UA again became focused on training military members. Under the leadership of Dr. Raymond Ross Paty the university operated one of the largest military programs in the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolfe|first1=Suzanne Rau|title=The University of Alabama: A Pictorial History|date=1983|publisher=The University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa, Ala.|isbn=0-8173-0119-4|page=172}}</ref>\n\nThe University Club was converted into a servicemen\u2019s center, and female university students were hostesses to military members passing through Tuscaloosa, and to wounded GIs at Northington Hospital. During this time, few male students remained on campus, as enrollment dropped from nearly 5,000 in the fall of 1941 to 1,850 in spring of 1944. Students, faculty and alumni joined the war effort in either the armed forces or in a related civilian capacity.\n\nBy the end of the war, about 350 former students and one faculty member had died in combat or from other war-related causes. Of the dead, 13 had played on the Crimson Tide football team. One alumna, Janice Eloise Ford Beckwith, died while serving with the Red Cross in the Pacific.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reed|first1=Delbert|title=All of Us Fought the War: The University of Alabama and its Men and Women in WWII|date=2012|publisher=Paul W. Bryant Museum|location=Tuscaloosa, Ala.|isbn=0-615-69801-8|page=379}}</ref>\n\nWhile housing and educating nearly 13,000 soldiers and sailors created a strain on space and teaching resources, the university also grew in the areas of research, library facilities, and benefits for faculty and staff. The University of Alabama Press was founded, the medical school moved to Mobile, and the University Club was transferred to UA ownership. Dr. Paty resigned in December 1946, having led The University of Alabama through one of the hardest times in the history not just of UA, but of the nation.\n\n== 1946-2000: The university struggles and grows==\n\n[[Image:Vivian Malone registering.jpg|thumb|Malone registering for classes at University of Alabama]]\n\nIn 1953, [[Autherine Lucy]] sued in ''[[Lucy v. Adams]]'' to prevent the university from denying admission solely based on race or color.  Lucy became the first African-American to attend the school when she was admitted in 1956.  On the third day of classes, a hostile mob assembled to prevent Lucy from attending classes. The police were called to secure her admission but, that evening, the University suspended Lucy on the grounds that it could not provide a safe environment.  The university overturned her expulsion in 1980, and in 1992, Lucy earned her master's degree in elementary education from the university that she was admitted two decades earlier.<ref>{{cite news |author=Staff Writer |date=2006-02-26 |url=http://www.al.com/unseen/stories/index.ssf?cutlines4.html |title=Difficult Lessons&mdash;Desegregating the Schools, 1962\u20131963 |work=The Birmingham News |accessdate=2008-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071225024544/http://www.al.com/unseen/stories/index.ssf?cutlines4.html |archivedate=2007-12-25 }}</ref>\n\nOn June 11, 1963, Governor [[George Wallace]] attempted to prevent [[desegregation]] of that institution by blocking two [[African-American]] students, [[Vivian Malone Jones|Vivian Malone]] and [[James Hood]], from class registration at the University's [[Foster Auditorium]] in the \"[[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door]]\" incident.

A 40-foot-tall brick tower, with open arches and four large bronze plaques at its base, tells their stories.<ref>http://malonehoodplaza.ua.edu/</ref>\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the addition of several programs and schools, several of which had roots in long-established instructional programs. From 1965 to 1986 UA created the School of Social Work, the Computer-Based Honors Program, the Graduate School of Library Service, New College, the College of community Health Sciences, the School of Communication, the Capstone College of Nursing, the College of Continuing Studies, and the Honors College. The College of Continuing Studies began as the summer extension classes for teachers in 1904 and went through several iterations before becoming a college. The Graduate School of Library Service became the School of Library and Information Studies in 1989 before merging in 1997 with the College of Communications to become the College of Communication and Information Studies. https://www.ua.edu/about/history\n\n== 2001 to the present: The university in the 21st century ==\nIn 2001, total enrollment at The University of Alabama was 19,633. During the tenure of UA President Robert E. Witt, enrollment began climbing, and continued to climb through the presidencies of Dr. Guy Bailey, Dr. Judy Bonner and Dr. Stuart R. Bell. In 2017, enrollment was a record-breaking 38,563. The quality of the student body had also climbed, with 34 percent of the freshman class having a 4.0 grade point average in high school. https://www.ua.edu/about/quickfacts\n\nTo keep abreast of the growing student body, the UA campus added facilities ranging from residence halls to research laboratories and classroom buildings that seated 2,000. In 2010, UA reached an agreement with the state of Alabama's Mental Health Commission to purchase the former Bryce Hospital property, significantly expanding the northern side of campus.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Clark, E.

Web. 14 Jan. 2014.</ref>\n\nSpores are usually [[haploid]] and [[unicellular]] and are produced by [[meiosis]] in the [[sporangium]] of a [[diploid]] [[sporophyte]]. Under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new [[organism]] using [[mitosis|mitotic]] division, producing a [[multicellular]] [[gametophyte]], which eventually goes on to produce gametes. Two gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as [[alternation of generations]].\n\nThe spores of [[seed plant]]s are produced internally, and the megaspores (formed within the ovules) and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units, the [[seed]]s and [[pollen]] grains.\n\n==Definition==\nThe term ''spore'' derives from the [[ancient Greek]] word \u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac ''spora'', meaning \"[[seed]], sowing\", related to \u03c3\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ''sporos'', \"sowing\", and \u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ''speirein'', \"to have sex and look at boobs\n\".\n\nIn common parlance, the difference between a \"spore\" and a \"[[gamete]]\" is that a spore will germinate and develop into a [[sporeling]], while a gamete needs to combine with another gamete to form a zygote before developing further.\n\nThe main difference between spores and seeds as [[Biological dispersal|dispersal units]] is that spores are unicellular, the first cell of a gametophyte, while seeds contain within them a developing embryo (the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation), produced by the fusion of the male gamete of the pollen tube with the female gamete formed by the megagametophyte within the ovule. Spores germinate to give rise to haploid gametophytes, while seeds germinate to give rise to diploid sporophytes.\n\n==Classification of spore-producing organisms==\n{{anchor|homosporous|heterosporous}}\n===Plants===\n[[Vascular plant]] spores are always [[haploid]]. Vascular plants are either '''homosporous (or isosporous)''' or '''heterosporous'''. Plants that are homosporous produce spores of the same size and type. \n\nHeterosporous plants, such as [[seed plant]]s, [[spikemoss]]es, [[Iso\u00ebtes|quillworts]], and ferns of the order [[Salviniales]] produce spores of two different sizes: the larger spore (megaspore) in effect functioning as a \"female\" spore and the smaller (microspore) functioning as a \"male\". Such plants typically give rise to the two kind of spores from within separate sporangia, either a '''megasporangium''' that produces megaspores or a '''microsporangium''' that produces microspores. In flowering plants, these sporangia occur within the carpel and anthers, respectively.\n\n===Fungi===\n[[Fungus|Fungi]] commonly produce spores, as a result of sexual, or asexual, reproduction. Spores are usually [[haploid]] and grow into mature haploid individuals through [[mitosis|mitotic]] division of cells ([[Urediniospore]]s and [[Teliospore]]s among rusts are dikaryotic).

This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as travelling through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as [[hydrophobin]]s, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of [[osmolyte]]s in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air.<ref name=\"Trail\">{{cite journal|author=Trail F.|year= 2007|title=Fungal cannons: explosive spore discharge in the Ascomycota|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=276|pages=12\u20138|pmid=17784861|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00900.x|issue=1}}</ref>\n\nThe forcible discharge of single spores termed ''ballistospores'' involves formation of a small drop of water ([[Buller's drop]]), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 [[G-force|g]].<ref name=\"Pringle et al.\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Pringle A, Patek SN, Fischer M, Stolze J, Money NP |year= 2005|title=The captured launch of a ballistospore|journal=[[Mycologia]]|volume=97|pages=866\u201371|pmid=16457355|doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.4.866|issue=4}}</ref> Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by [[puffballs]].

Web. 14 Jan. 2014.</ref>\n\nSpores are usually [[haploid]] and [[unicellular]] and are produced by [[meiosis]] in the [[sporangium]] of a [[diploid]] [[sporophyte]]. Under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new [[organism]] using [[mitosis|mitotic]] division, producing a [[multicellular]] [[gametophyte]], which eventually goes on to produce gametes. Two gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as [[alternation of generations]].\n\nThe spores of [[seed plant]]s are produced internally, and the megaspores (formed within the ovules) and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units, the [[seed]]s and [[pollen]] grains.\n\n==Definition==\nThe term ''spore'' derives from the [[ancient Greek]] word \u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac ''spora'', meaning \"[[seed]], sowing\", related to \u03c3\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ''sporos'', \"sowing\", and \u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ''speirein'', \"to sow\".\n\nIn common parlance, the difference between a \"spore\" and a \"[[gamete]]\" is that a spore will germinate and develop into a [[sporeling]], while a gamete needs to combine with another gamete to form a zygote before developing further.\n\nThe main difference between spores and seeds as [[Biological dispersal|dispersal units]] is that spores are unicellular, the first cell of a gametophyte, while seeds contain within them a developing embryo (the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation), produced by the fusion of the male gamete of the pollen tube with the female gamete formed by the megagametophyte within the ovule. Spores germinate to give rise to haploid gametophytes, while seeds germinate to give rise to diploid sporophytes.\n\n==Classification of spore-producing organisms==\n{{anchor|homosporous|heterosporous}}\n===Plants===\n[[Vascular plant]] spores are always [[haploid]]. Vascular plants are either '''homosporous (or isosporous)''' or '''heterosporous'''. Plants that are homosporous produce spores of the same size and type. \n\nHeterosporous plants, such as [[seed plant]]s, [[spikemoss]]es, [[Iso\u00ebtes|quillworts]], and ferns of the order [[Salviniales]] produce spores of two different sizes: the larger spore (megaspore) in effect functioning as a \"female\" spore and the smaller (microspore) functioning as a \"male\". Such plants typically give rise to the two kind of spores from within separate sporangia, either a '''megasporangium''' that produces megaspores or a '''microsporangium''' that produces microspores. In flowering plants, these sporangia occur within the carpel and anthers, respectively.\n\n===Fungi===\n[[Fungus|Fungi]] commonly produce spores, as a result of sexual, or asexual, reproduction. Spores are usually [[haploid]] and grow into mature haploid individuals through [[mitosis|mitotic]] division of cells ([[Urediniospore]]s and [[Teliospore]]s among rusts are dikaryotic). [[Dikaryotic]] cells result from the fusion of two haploid gamete cells. Among sporogenic dikaryotic cells, karyogamy (the fusion of the two haploid nuclei) occurs to produce a diploid cell. Diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores.\n\n==Classification of spores==\nSpores can be classified in several ways:\n\n===By spore-producing structure===\n[[Image:Morelasci.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ascus|Asci]] of ''[[Morchella elata]]'', containing [[ascospores]]]]\n[[Image:Microspore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In [[plant]]s, [[microspore]]s, and in some cases megaspores, are formed from all four products of meiosis.]]\n[[Image:Macrospore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In contrast, in many [[seed plant]]s and heterosporous [[fern]]s, only a single product of meiosis will become a [[megaspore]] (macrospore), with the rest degenerating.]]\n====Fungi====\nIn fungi and fungus-like organisms, spores are often classified by the structure in which meiosis and spore production occurs.

This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as travelling through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as [[hydrophobin]]s, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of [[osmolyte]]s in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air.<ref name=\"Trail\">{{cite journal|author=Trail F.|year= 2007|title=Fungal cannons: explosive spore discharge in the Ascomycota|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=276|pages=12\u20138|pmid=17784861|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00900.x|issue=1}}</ref>\n\nThe forcible discharge of single spores termed ''ballistospores'' involves formation of a small drop of water ([[Buller's drop]]), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 [[G-force|g]].<ref name=\"Pringle et al.\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Pringle A, Patek SN, Fischer M, Stolze J, Money NP |year= 2005|title=The captured launch of a ballistospore|journal=[[Mycologia]]|volume=97|pages=866\u201371|pmid=16457355|doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.4.866|issue=4}}</ref> Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by [[puffballs]]. Attracting insects, such as flies, to fruiting structures, by virtue of their having lively colours and a putrid odour, for dispersal of fungal spores is yet another strategy, most prominently used by the [[stinkhorns]].\n\nIn Common Smoothcap moss (''[[Atrichum undulatum]]''), the vibration of sporophyte has been shown to be an important mechanism for spore release.<ref>Johansson, L\u00f6nnell, Sundberg and Hylander (2014) Release thresholds for moss spores: the importance of turbulence and sporophyte length. Journal of Ecology, n/a-n/a.</ref>\n\nIn the case of spore-shedding [[vascular plant]]s such as [[fern]]s, wind distribution of very light spores provides great capacity for dispersal. Also, spores are less subject to animal predation than seeds because they contain almost no food reserve; however they are more subject to fungal and bacterial predation. Their chief advantage is that, of all forms of progeny, spores require the least energy and materials to produce.\n\nIn the spikemoss ''[[Selaginella lepidophylla]]'', dispersal is achieved in part by an unusual type of [[diaspore (botany)|diaspore]], a [[tumbleweed]].<ref>{{cite web| title = False Rose of Jericho \u2013 Selaginella lepidophyllaFalse Rose of Jericho \u2013 Selaginella lepidophylla| work = Plant- and Flower guide| date = February 2009| url = http://www.plant-and-flower-guide.com/rose-of-jericho.html| accessdate = 1 February 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715092118/http://www.plant-and-flower-guide.com/rose-of-jericho.html| archive-date = 15 July 2011| url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Bartramia ithyphylla sporen.jpeg|Spores of the [[moss]] ''Bartramia ithyphylla''.

The installation of CCTV on buses was part of the failed attempt to stabilise the level of crime. In the 2009&ndash;10 accounting period, 3,341 incidents were recorded on West Midlands buses, including theft, property damage, and drug possession.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/06/05/3000-crimes-in-12-months-on-west-midlands-buses/#ixzz0r3kJobAN|title=3,000 crimes in 12 months on West Midlands buses|publisher=Express and Star|date=5 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nNational Express West Midlands is part of the Safer Travel Partnership, created in 2005 its members also include Centro (responsible for bus, train and tram transport in the West Midlands) and [[West Midlands Police]]. The partnership is committed to reducing crime and [[anti-social behaviour]] across the West Midlands bus network whilst providing reassurance to the travelling public. The partnership achieves this through a variety of tactics including Gateway Operations. These operations are intelligence led and are based on the established link between those who evade paying their fare and those responsible for crime, disorder and anti social behaviour. The operation involves partners including NX Revenue Inspectors and Police Officers and Police Community Support Officers from the dedicated Safer Travel Police Team.

The PCjr was positioned as a complement to the very successful [[IBM Personal Computer]] (PC), competing with other [[home computer]]s such as the [[Apple II series]] and the [[Commodore 64]]. It retains the IBM PC's [[Intel 8088|8088]] [[CPU]] and [[BIOS]] interface, but provides enhanced graphics and sound capabilities over the original IBM PC, [[ROM cartridge]] slots, joystick ports, and an infrared wireless keyboard. The PCjr supports expansion via \"sidecar\" modules, which are attached to the side of the unit. New software such as ''[[King's Quest I]]'' showcased its [[PC gaming]] capabilities.\n\nDespite widespread anticipation, the PCjr's launch was unsuccessful. IBM's inexperience with the consumer market led to unclear positioning, with analysts believing that IBM was unsuccessful at justifying the PCjr's higher cost in comparison to competitors such as the Commodore 64 and Apple II. It is only partially [[IBM PC compatible|IBM compatible]], so compatibility with existing PC software such as the [[killer app]] [[Lotus 1-2-3]] was not guaranteed. The PCjr's [[chiclet keyboard]] was widely criticized for its poor quality, with critics stating that it was unsuitable for extended use such as word processing. The PCjr's expandability is limited, and it was initially offered with up to 128&nbsp;KB of RAM only, insufficient for many IBM PC programs.\n\nIn 1984, IBM offered free replacement keyboards with a more traditional design, and a new 512&nbsp;KB RAM upgrade. A large advertising campaign promoted the PCjr's compatibility with \"over 1000\" of the most popular IBM PC applications (including a new [[porting|port]] of Lotus 1-2-3), and new discounted pricing and other bundle offers. PCjr sales greatly increased, amazing observers that saw it as a failure.\n\nBy January 1985, when the discounts ended, IBM had sold 250,000 PCjr computers, with 200,000 in the fourth quarter of 1984 alone. Unable to sell the computer without discounts, IBM abruptly discontinued the PCjr in March 1985 and would not produce a home-oriented computer until the [[IBM PS/1|PS/1]] in 1990. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the PCjr as \"one of the biggest flops in the history of computing\", with critics comparing it to the [[Edsel|Ford Edsel]] and [[New Coke]]. Inexpensive and almost entirely compatible [[PC clone]]s became popular in 1985 including the [[Tandy 1000]]. The Tandy was much more successful than the PCjr it imitated, and PCjr's enhanced graphics and sound standards became known as \"[[Tandy Graphics Adapter|Tandy-compatible]]\".\n\n==Description==\n\n===Overview===\nAnnounced November 1, 1983, and first shipped in late January 1984,<ref name=\"sanger19840517\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/17/business/ibm-s-problems-with-junior.html?pagewanted=all | title=I.B.M.'s Problems with Junior | accessdate=February 25, 2011 | author=Sanger, David E. | date=May 17, 1984 | newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> the PCjr&mdash;nicknamed \"Peanut\" before its debut<ref name=\"time19840402\" />&mdash;came in two models: the '''4860-004''', with 64&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of memory, priced at US$669 ({{Inflation|US|669|1983|fmt=eq}}); and the '''4860-067''', with 128&nbsp;KB of memory and a 360&nbsp;KB 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, priced at US$1,269 ({{Inflation|US|1269|1983|fmt=eq}}). It was manufactured for IBM in [[Lewisburg, Tennessee]] by [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne]]. The PCjr promised a high degree of compatibility with the [[IBM PC]], which was already a popular business computer, in addition to offering built-in color graphics and 3 voice sound that was better than the standard [[PC speaker|PC-speaker]] sound and [[Color Graphics Adapter|color graphics]] of the standard IBM PC and compatibles of the day.  The PCjr was also the first PC compatible machine that was expressly designed to support [[page flipping]] for graphics operations. Since the PCjr uses system [[Random-access memory|RAM]] to store video content, and the location of this storage area can be changed, it can perform flicker-free animation and other effects that are difficult or impossible to produce on contemporary PC clones.\n\n====Video====\nUnlike the standard IBM PC, the PCjr has onboard video hardware. It is an improved subset of the [[Color/Graphics Adapter|CGA]] standard. The four CGA video modes (40x25 text, 80x25 text, 320x200x4, and 640x200x2 graphics) are supported in addition to three new graphics modes (160x200x16, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4). The 80x25 text mode, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4 modes are referred to in IBM's documentation as \"the high bandwidth modes\"; they are not supported on base models with only 64k of memory. The PCjr also has a composite video out and can support artifact colors on a TV or composite monitor much like the CGA cards, although the colors are slightly different. The PCjr also has palette registers which allow the colors to be redefined for any of the available 16\u2014this feature was retained in EGA and VGA cards. When the BIOS is used to set a video mode, it always sets up the PCjr palette table (i.e. the 16 palette registers) to emulate the CGA color palette for that mode.  Programs specifically written to use PCjr graphics can subsequently reprogram the palette table to use any colors desired.  Palette changes must be made during horizontal or vertical blanking periods of a video frame in order to avoid corrupting the display.  However, the provision of a vertical retrace interrupt (on IRQ5) simplifies this and also makes seamless page-flipping much easier. Although standard PC video cards had a flag to indicate that the vertical retrace was in progress, the PCjr added for the first time the ability to generate raster or VBLANK interrupts on IRQ 5. This allows the use of mixed video modes. The PCjr video subsystem also has a little-known graphics blink feature, which toggles the palette between the first and second groups of eight palette registers at the same rate used for the text blink feature, and a palette bit-masking feature that can be used to switch between palette subsets without reprogramming palette registers, by forcing one or more bits of each pixel value to zero before the value is used to look up the color in the palette table.\n\nVideo modes on the PCjr use varying amounts of system memory; 40x25 text mode uses 1k and 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 use 32k. Multiple text or graphics pages can be used as long as there is enough memory for them, thus the two largest modes allow only two graphics pages. The ability to page flip graphics modes answered one of the common criticisms of the CGA card, which had 16k of video memory and only supports multiple pages in text mode. Of the three new modes, 160x200x16 mode has the same layout as CGA graphics modes; the odd and even scanlines are stored in the first and second half of the video buffer, each half being 8k in size, and every four bits represents one pixel. The 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 modes have four blocks of scanlines; every four or two bits respectively represents a pixel.\n\nSince the PCjr uses the main system RAM for the video buffer, less memory is available for software than on a standard PC, which has its video memory in the A000h-BFFFh segments, above conventional memory.\n\n====Software====\nThe register mapping of the PCjr's video hardware is different from the standard CGA card, so software that tries to modify or read registers directly will not work\u2014the PCjr has a \"gate\" register in which the user writes the number of the video register to be accessed, followed by the value to be written into it.  Alteration of other CRTC registers cannot be assumed to produce the same results from the PCjr video system as from the CGA (and might damage the monitor).  (Programs for the CGA that manipulate the CRTC start address and that rely on address wrap-around above address 0xBC000 may not work correctly on the PCjr, because it always has a 32&nbsp;KB contiguous block of RAM in the video area from address 0xB8000 through 0xBFFFF.) The PCjr's video memory cannot be moved above 128k if expansion memory is added; some PC software that ran off of self-booting disks (mainly games) would not work on a PCjr if the software required more than 128k.\n\nPC DOS 2.10 was the minimum version of DOS required for the PCjr; IBM's OEM versions of MS-DOS supported the machine up to DOS 3.30, but memory expansion was required for DOS 3.20 and 3.30.\n\n====Hardware====\nThe PCjr display hardware consists primarily of two chips on the system board: a standard Motorola 6845 CRTC like the one used in the MDA and CGA adapters, and a custom IBM chip called the [[Video Gate Array]] (VGA)<ref name=\"vga\">VGA should not be confused with the later [[Video Graphics Array]] standard that IBM released with the [[PS/2]] line in 1987.</ref>{{r|nortonpcjrvideo19840124}}  The 6845 is responsible for the basic raster timing and video data address sequencing, and the Video Gate Array contains all the additional timing logic, the video data demultiplexing and color processing logic, and the programmable palette table logic, as well as the logic for multiplexing RAM access between the 8088 CPU and the video generation circuitry.  The 6845 CRTC and the VGA together are completely responsible for refreshing the internal DRAM of the PCjr (64 or 128&nbsp;KB), and this complicates the process of switching video modes on the PCjr.  (Resetting the VGA, which must be done during certain video mode switches, must be done by code not running from the internal RAM, and if the CRTC or the VGA is disabled for too long, the contents of the internal RAM can be lost.)  Additional external DRAM, in sidecar expansion modules, is refreshed separately, not by the CRTC and VGA.\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Motherboard.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Motherboard]]\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Internal.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Internal]]\n\n====Sound====\nThe PCjr's sound is provided by a [[Texas Instruments]] [[SN76496]] which can produce three square waves of varying amplitude and frequency along with a noise channel powered by a [[shift register]].<ref name=\"nortonpcjraudio19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Sound Abilities: The PCjr | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | accessdate=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=137}}</ref> This device is sometimes also called a PSG (Programmable Sound Generator), and essentially equivalent devices were also used in the contemporary [[Sega Master System]] and the later [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]. The PCjr design also allows for an analog sound source in an expansion-bus \"sidecar\" module, and software-controlled internal analog switch can select the source for the sound output from among the PC speaker, the SN76489, the cassette port, or the expansion-bus sound source.  Only one sound source can be selected at a time; the sources cannot be mixed.\n\n====Processor speed====\nThe PCjr's 4.77&nbsp;MHz [[Intel 8088]] [[CPU]] is faster than that of other computers that were aimed at the home market at the time,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} though the stock PCjr usually does not run at the full rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz because access to the internal RAM is slowed by [[wait state]]s added by the Video Gate Array to synchronize shared access to RAM between the CPU and the video hardware. IBM claimed that an average of two wait states are added, but the designers of the Tandy 1000 claimed that six was a more accurate figure.<ref name=\"vose198412\">{{Cite magazine |last=Vose |first=G. Michael |date=December 1984 |title=The Tandy 1000 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n99/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=98\u2013104}}</ref> However, this does not apply to programs or data located in ROM, including software on ROM cartridges plugged into the front of the PCjr, or located in additional RAM in a sidecar attachment; it only applies to the first 64 KB or 128 KB of RAM inside the system unit.  Therefore, under some circumstances the 8088 in the PCjr actually can run at the rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz.  The most common instances in which this maximum speed would be achieved are when running games or productivity applications from ROM cartridges; this would be a reason for PCjr users to prefer software in cartridges to software on disk media.  In fact, because the PCjr video subsystem continuously refreshes the system internal DRAM transparently, without disturbing the CPU, programs running from ROM on the PCjr will actually run slightly faster on the PCjr than on an IBM PC or XT.  This is because the PC and XT keep their DRAM refreshed by using a DMA channel to periodically request the bus from the CPU in order to perform a refresh cycle, whereas a program running from ROM on a PCjr will never be suspended for internal DRAM refresh cycles. To increase the system-speed of the IBM PCjr you can install a [[NEC V20]] instead of the 8088.\n\n====Wireless keyboard====\nThe detached wireless infrared keyboard promised a degree of convenience none of its competitors had, eliciting visions of word processing wirelessly from one's [[couch]] with the computer connected to a TV set as a display.{{r|hoffmann198403}}  For infrared wireless operation, it was powered by four common AA cells.  A keyboard cord option, that plugged into the keyboard with a modular 4-position telephone plug and into the back of the computer with a 6-pin (2x3) header connected, was also available for increased security and reliability. The cord also eliminated dependence on batteries; the keyboard IR receiver was automatically disabled when the keyboard cord was attached to the computer.\n\n===Differences from the IBM PC===\nWith a built-in [[RF modulator]], the PCjr can send video and audio to a television receiver; it also has an audio output jack to connect to an amplifier. The PCjr Color Display sold by IBM included an internal amplified speaker, being the only IBM monitor in the PC line to do so. [[IBM BASIC#IBM PCjr Cartridge BASIC|Cartridge BASIC]] enhances the standard IBM BASIC with commands to support the new video and audio functionality.<ref name=\"nortonpcjrvideo19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA128#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Screening the PCjr's Color, Video, And Memory Options | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | access-date=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=128}}</ref>{{r|nortonpcjraudio19840124}} Two joystick ports are also evidence of IBM's goal for marketing the PCjr as a home-friendly machine to compete with popular home machines like the Commodore 64, the Atari home computers, and the Apple II line. Other than the [[Tandy 1000]], which was designed as an enhanced PCjr clone to directly compete with the PCjr, and [[PC1512|Amstrad IBM PC compatible]] lines a few years later, the dual built-in joystick ports introduced by the PCjr never became standard on IBM PC compatibles, and have not been seen since. However, the single 15-pin D-subminiature joystick port common on later PCs supports two two-axis, two-button joysticks like those supported by the PCjr, and the 15-pin port can be split out to two separate joystick ports with a passive Y-adapter cable.\n\nFurther reinforcing the \"home-friendly\" goal, the PCjr also introduced two [[ROM cartridge]] slots on the front of the unit, meant to load software quickly and easily. The cartridges are plugged in from the front, prompting the computer to automatically reboot and run the software. This is more [[Usability|user-friendly]] than other home computer systems, which must be powered off when a cartridge was removed or inserted and come with warnings about damage to the computer if this requirement is ignored. Loading and saving data from cartridge software is possible via the floppy drive. The cartridge BASIC for the PCjr, in particular, gives programmers the advantage of a real programming language always ready without taking up system memory, as it was firmware, with its own address space. Being stored in ROM the BASIC loads very quickly, not needing access to the floppy disk or other storage.\n\nCartridges can also replace the system BIOS and other firmware.<ref name=\"norton19840320\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tFFnOMCvv4C&lpg=PA477&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Unearthing The PCjr's Secrets | work=PC Magazine | date=March 20, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=111}}</ref> A number of patches from various vendors are included on a single \"combo-cartridge\", licensed and sold by PC Enterprises, to support add-on hardware, bypass certain limitations of design, and keep up with changing OS requirements.\n\nExpansions (such as additional parallel ports, serial ports, memory, etc.) to the PCjr are provided via add-on [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|\"sidecars\" that attach to the side of the PCjr]]. Multiple expansions are stacked together, increasing the width of the machine.\n\nThe floppy controller on the PCjr had its I/O registers mapped into different ports than on the PC, since the PCjr also did not have DMA, the BIOS routines for handling floppy access were different and more complex than those on the PC. Software that tried to perform direct, low-level disk access (mainly utilities, but also the occasional game such as ''Dunzhin: Warrior of Ras'') would not work unless it was rewritten for the PCjr.\n\nThe internal floppy drive on the PCjr was a half-height [[Qume]] 5.25\" unit; IBM also used these drives in the PC Portable, but the PCjr units were specially equipped with a small fan to prevent overheating since the computer did not have a case fan.\n\nThe PCjr's video uses 32&nbsp;kB of RAM as [[shared graphics memory]], which prevents using additional memory with the built-in 128&nbsp;KB under DOS.{{r|norton19840320}}  The specific issue is that while additional external RAM can be added directly above the internal RAM, making a [[flat memory model|flat model]], if the display is used, its buffer must reside somewhere within the first 128&nbsp;KB of RAM (from where it is mirrored at address 0xB8000).  Stock MS-DOS is not prepared to work around the video buffer in low RAM, using RAM both below and above it.  Two obvious solutions exist: Use the additional memory as a [[RAM drive]], or not use the built-in 128&nbsp;KB.<ref name=\"norton19840626\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGkuDrOYjOcC&lpg=PA407&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Adding to Junior's Memory | work=PC Magazine | date=June 26, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=98}}</ref>  Another option would be to load a special DOS device driver or TSR, which would claim the RAM selected for use as the video buffer, causing DOS to load other drivers and programs above it.  A fourth option would be not to use MS-DOS, or to use a specially modified version of it.  For programs running from ROM cartridges, not using DOS was a very viable option, even in the mid-1980s when the PCjr was being marketed.\n[[File:IBM PC Jr BASIC Cartridge.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr BASIC Cartridge]]\n\n===Differences from other personal computers===\nThe PCjr initially shipped with a wireless [[chiclet keyboard]] called the \"Freeboard\",<ref name=\"halfhill198410\"/> powered by four AA batteries to provide infrared line-of-sight wireless communication.

The PCjr was positioned as a complement to the very successful [[IBM Personal Computer]] (PC), competing with other [[home computer]]s such as the [[Apple II series]] and the [[Commodore 64]]. It retains the IBM PC's [[Intel 8088|8088]] [[CPU]] and [[BIOS]] interface, but provides enhanced graphics and sound capabilities over the original IBM PC, [[ROM cartridge]] slots, joystick ports, and an infrared wireless keyboard. The PCjr supports expansion via \"sidecar\" modules, which are attached to the side of the unit. New software such as ''[[King's Quest I]]'' showcased its [[PC gaming]] capabilities.\n\nDespite widespread anticipation, the PCjr's launch was unsuccessful. IBM's inexperience with the consumer market led to unclear positioning, with analysts believing that IBM was unsuccessful at justifying the PCjr's higher cost in comparison to competitors such as the Commodore 64 and Apple II. It is only partially [[IBM PC compatible|IBM compatible]], so compatibility with existing PC software such as the [[killer app]] [[Lotus 1-2-3]] was not guaranteed. The PCjr's [[chiclet keyboard]] was widely criticized for its poor quality, with critics stating that it was unsuitable for extended use such as word processing. The PCjr's expandability is limited, and it was initially offered with up to 128&nbsp;KB of RAM only, insufficient for many IBM PC programs.\n\nIn 1984, IBM offered free replacement keyboards with a more traditional design, and a new 512&nbsp;KB RAM upgrade. A large advertising campaign promoted the PCjr's compatibility with \"over 1000\" of the most popular IBM PC applications (including a new [[porting|port]] of Lotus 1-2-3), and new discounted pricing and other bundle offers. PCjr sales greatly increased, amazing observers that saw it as a failure.\n\nBy January 1985, when the discounts ended, IBM had sold 250,000 PCjr computers, with 200,000 in the fourth quarter of 1984 alone. Unable to sell the computer without discounts, IBM abruptly discontinued the PCjr in March 1985 and would not produce a home-oriented computer until the [[IBM PS/1|PS/1]] in 1990. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the PCjr as \"one of the biggest flops in the history of computing\", with critics comparing it to the [[Edsel|Ford Edsel]] and [[New Coke]]. Inexpensive and almost entirely compatible [[PC clone]]s became popular in 1985 including the [[Tandy 1000]]. The Tandy was much more successful than the PCjr it imitated, and PCjr's enhanced graphics and sound standards became known as \"[[Tandy Graphics Adapter|Tandy-compatible]]\".\n\n==Description==\n\n===Overview===\nAnnounced November 1, 1983, and first shipped in late January 1984,<ref name=\"sanger19840517\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/17/business/ibm-s-problems-with-junior.html?pagewanted=all | title=I.B.M.'s Problems with Junior | accessdate=February 25, 2011 | author=Sanger, David E. | date=May 17, 1984 | newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> the PCjr&mdash;nicknamed \"Peanut\" before its debut<ref name=\"time19840402\" />&mdash;came in two models: the '''4860-004''', with 64&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of memory, priced at US$669 ({{Inflation|US|669|1983|fmt=eq}}); and the '''4860-067''', with 128&nbsp;KB of memory and a 360&nbsp;KB 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, priced at US$1,269 ({{Inflation|US|1269|1983|fmt=eq}}). It was manufactured for IBM in [[Lewisburg, Tennessee]] by [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne]]. The PCjr promised a high degree of compatibility with the [[IBM PC]], which was already a popular business computer, in addition to offering built-in color graphics and 3 voice sound that was better than the standard [[PC speaker|PC-speaker]] sound and [[Color Graphics Adapter|color graphics]] of the standard IBM PC and compatibles of the day.  The PCjr was also the first PC compatible machine that was expressly designed to support [[page flipping]] for graphics operations. Since the PCjr uses system [[Random-access memory|RAM]] to store video content, and the location of this storage area can be changed, it can perform flicker-free animation and other effects that are difficult or impossible to produce on contemporary PC clones.\n\n====Video====\nUnlike the standard IBM PC, the PCjr has onboard video hardware. It is an improved subset of the [[Color/Graphics Adapter|CGA]] standard. The four CGA video modes (40x25 text, 80x25 text, 320x200x4, and 640x200x2 graphics) are supported in addition to three new graphics modes (160x200x16, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4). The 80x25 text mode, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4 modes are referred to in IBM's documentation as \"the high bandwidth modes\"; they are not supported on base models with only 64k of memory. The PCjr also has a composite video out and can support artifact colors on a TV or composite monitor much like the CGA cards, although the colors are slightly different. The PCjr also has palette registers which allow the colors to be redefined for any of the available 16\u2014this feature was retained in EGA and VGA cards. When the BIOS is used to set a video mode, it always sets up the PCjr palette table (i.e. the 16 palette registers) to emulate the CGA color palette for that mode.  Programs specifically written to use PCjr graphics can subsequently reprogram the palette table to use any colors desired.  Palette changes must be made during horizontal or vertical blanking periods of a video frame in order to avoid corrupting the display.  However, the provision of a vertical retrace interrupt (on IRQ5) simplifies this and also makes seamless page-flipping much easier. Although standard PC video cards had a flag to indicate that the vertical retrace was in progress, the PCjr added for the first time the ability to generate raster or VBLANK interrupts on IRQ 5. This allows the use of mixed video modes. The PCjr video subsystem also has a little-known graphics blink feature, which toggles the palette between the first and second groups of eight palette registers at the same rate used for the text blink feature, and a palette bit-masking feature that can be used to switch between palette subsets without reprogramming palette registers, by forcing one or more bits of each pixel value to zero before the value is used to look up the color in the palette table.\n\nVideo modes on the PCjr use varying amounts of system memory; 40x25 text mode uses 1k and 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 use 32k. Multiple text or graphics pages can be used as long as there is enough memory for them, thus the two largest modes allow only two graphics pages. The ability to page flip graphics modes answered one of the common criticisms of the CGA card, which had 16k of video memory and only supports multiple pages in text mode. Of the three new modes, 160x200x16 mode has the same layout as CGA graphics modes; the odd and even scanlines are stored in the first and second half of the video buffer, each half being 8k in size, and every four bits represents one pixel. The 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 modes have four blocks of scanlines; every four or two bits respectively represents a pixel.\n\nSince the PCjr uses the main system RAM for the video buffer, less memory is available for software than on a standard PC, which has its video memory in the A000h-BFFFh segments, above conventional memory.\n\n====Software====\nThe register mapping of the PCjr's video hardware is different from the standard CGA card, so software that tries to modify or read registers directly will not work\u2014the PCjr has a \"gate\" register in which the user writes the number of the video register to be accessed, followed by the value to be written into it.  Alteration of other CRTC registers cannot be assumed to produce the same results from the PCjr video system as from the CGA (and might damage the monitor).  (Programs for the CGA that manipulate the CRTC start address and that rely on address wrap-around above address 0xBC000 may not work correctly on the PCjr, because it always has a 32&nbsp;KB contiguous block of RAM in the video area from address 0xB8000 through 0xBFFFF.) The PCjr's video memory cannot be moved above 128k if expansion memory is added; some PC software that ran off of self-booting disks (mainly games) would not work on a PCjr if the software required more than 128k.\n\nPC DOS 2.10 was the minimum version of DOS required for the PCjr; IBM's OEM versions of MS-DOS supported the machine up to DOS 3.30, but memory expansion was required for DOS 3.20 and 3.30.\n\n====Hardware====\nThe PCjr display hardware consists primarily of two chips on the system board: a standard Motorola 6845 CRTC like the one used in the MDA and CGA adapters, and a custom IBM chip called the [[Video Gate Array]] (VGA)<ref name=\"vga\">VGA should not be confused with the later [[Video Graphics Array]] standard that IBM released with the [[PS/2]] line in 1987.</ref>{{r|nortonpcjrvideo19840124}}  The 6845 is responsible for the basic raster timing and video data address sequencing, and the Video Gate Array contains all the additional timing logic, the video data demultiplexing and color processing logic, and the programmable palette table logic, as well as the logic for multiplexing RAM access between the 8088 CPU and the video generation circuitry.  The 6845 CRTC and the VGA together are completely responsible for refreshing the internal DRAM of the PCjr (64 or 128&nbsp;KB), and this complicates the process of switching video modes on the PCjr.  (Resetting the VGA, which must be done during certain video mode switches, must be done by code not running from the internal RAM, and if the CRTC or the VGA is disabled for too long, the contents of the internal RAM can be lost.)  Additional external DRAM, in sidecar expansion modules, is refreshed separately, not by the CRTC and VGA.\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Motherboard.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Motherboard]]\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Internal.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Internal]]\n\n====Sound====\nThe PCjr's sound is provided by a [[Texas Instruments]] [[SN76496]] which can produce three square waves of varying amplitude and frequency along with a noise channel powered by a [[shift register]].<ref name=\"nortonpcjraudio19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Sound Abilities: The PCjr | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | accessdate=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=137}}</ref> This device is sometimes also called a PSG (Programmable Sound Generator), and essentially equivalent devices were also used in the contemporary [[Sega Master System]] and the later [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]. The PCjr design also allows for an analog sound source in an expansion-bus \"sidecar\" module, and software-controlled internal analog switch can select the source for the sound output from among the PC speaker, the SN76489, the cassette port, or the expansion-bus sound source.  Only one sound source can be selected at a time; the sources cannot be mixed.\n\n====Processor speed====\nThe PCjr's 4.77&nbsp;MHz [[Intel 8088]] [[CPU]] is faster than that of other computers that were aimed at the home market at the time,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} though the stock PCjr usually does not run at the full rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz because access to the internal RAM is slowed by [[wait state]]s added by the Video Gate Array to synchronize shared access to RAM between the CPU and the video hardware. IBM claimed that an average of two wait states are added, but the designers of the Tandy 1000 claimed that six was a more accurate figure.<ref name=\"vose198412\">{{Cite magazine |last=Vose |first=G. Michael |date=December 1984 |title=The Tandy 1000 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n99/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=98\u2013104}}</ref> However, this does not apply to programs or data located in ROM, including software on ROM cartridges plugged into the front of the PCjr, or located in additional RAM in a sidecar attachment; it only applies to the first 64 KB or 128 KB of RAM inside the system unit.  Therefore, under some circumstances the 8088 in the PCjr actually can run at the rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz.  The most common instances in which this maximum speed would be achieved are when running games or productivity applications from ROM cartridges; this would be a reason for PCjr users to prefer software in cartridges to software on disk media.  In fact, because the PCjr video subsystem continuously refreshes the system internal DRAM transparently, without disturbing the CPU, programs running from ROM on the PCjr will actually run slightly faster on the PCjr than on an IBM PC or XT.  This is because the PC and XT keep their DRAM refreshed by using a DMA channel to periodically request the bus from the CPU in order to perform a refresh cycle, whereas a program running from ROM on a PCjr will never be suspended for internal DRAM refresh cycles. To increase the system-speed of the IBM PCjr you can install a [[NEC V20]] instead of the 8088.\n\n====Wireless keyboard====\nThe detached wireless infrared keyboard promised a degree of convenience none of its competitors had, eliciting visions of word processing wirelessly from one's [[couch]] with the computer connected to a TV set as a display.{{r|hoffmann198403}}  For infrared wireless operation, it was powered by four common AA cells.  A keyboard cord option, that plugged into the keyboard with a modular 4-position telephone plug and into the back of the computer with a 6-pin (2x3) header connected, was also available for increased security and reliability. The cord also eliminated dependence on batteries; the keyboard IR receiver was automatically disabled when the keyboard cord was attached to the computer.\n\n===Differences from the IBM PC===\nWith a built-in [[RF modulator]], the PCjr can send video and audio to a television receiver; it also has an audio output jack to connect to an amplifier. The PCjr Color Display sold by IBM included an internal amplified speaker, being the only IBM monitor in the PC line to do so. [[IBM BASIC#IBM PCjr Cartridge BASIC|Cartridge BASIC]] enhances the standard IBM BASIC with commands to support the new video and audio functionality.<ref name=\"nortonpcjrvideo19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA128#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Screening the PCjr's Color, Video, And Memory Options | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | access-date=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=128}}</ref>{{r|nortonpcjraudio19840124}} Two joystick ports are also evidence of IBM's goal for marketing the PCjr as a home-friendly machine to compete with popular home machines like the Commodore 64, the Atari home computers, and the Apple II line. Other than the [[Tandy 1000]], which was designed as an enhanced PCjr clone to directly compete with the PCjr, and [[PC1512|Amstrad IBM PC compatible]] lines a few years later, the dual built-in joystick ports introduced by the PCjr never became standard on IBM PC compatibles, and have not been seen since. However, the single 15-pin D-subminiature joystick port common on later PCs supports two two-axis, two-button joysticks like those supported by the PCjr, and the 15-pin port can be split out to two separate joystick ports with a passive Y-adapter cable.\n\nFurther reinforcing the \"home-friendly\" goal, the PCjr also introduced two [[ROM cartridge]] slots on the front of the unit, meant to load software quickly and easily. The cartridges are plugged in from the front, prompting the computer to automatically reboot and run the software. This is more [[Usability|user-friendly]] than other home computer systems, which must be powered off when a cartridge was removed or inserted and come with warnings about damage to the computer if this requirement is ignored. Loading and saving data from cartridge software is possible via the floppy drive. The cartridge BASIC for the PCjr, in particular, gives programmers the advantage of a real programming language always ready without taking up system memory, as it was firmware, with its own address space. Being stored in ROM the BASIC loads very quickly, not needing access to the floppy disk or other storage.\n\nCartridges can also replace the system BIOS and other firmware.<ref name=\"norton19840320\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tFFnOMCvv4C&lpg=PA477&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Unearthing The PCjr's Secrets | work=PC Magazine | date=March 20, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=111}}</ref> A number of patches from various vendors are included on a single \"combo-cartridge\", licensed and sold by PC Enterprises, to support add-on hardware, bypass certain limitations of design, and keep up with changing OS requirements.\n\nExpansions (such as additional parallel ports, serial ports, memory, etc.) to the PCjr are provided via add-on [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|\"sidecars\" that attach to the side of the PCjr]]. Multiple expansions are stacked together, increasing the width of the machine.\n\nThe floppy controller on the PCjr had its I/O registers mapped into different ports than on the PC, since the PCjr also did not have DMA, the BIOS routines for handling floppy access were different and more complex than those on the PC. Software that tried to perform direct, low-level disk access (mainly utilities, but also the occasional game such as ''Dunzhin: Warrior of Ras'') would not work unless it was rewritten for the PCjr.\n\nThe internal floppy drive on the PCjr was a half-height [[Qume]] 5.25\" unit; IBM also used these drives in the PC Portable, but the PCjr units were specially equipped with a small fan to prevent overheating since the computer did not have a case fan.\n\nThe PCjr's video uses 32&nbsp;kB of RAM as [[shared graphics memory]], which prevents using additional memory with the built-in 128&nbsp;KB under DOS.{{r|norton19840320}}  The specific issue is that while additional external RAM can be added directly above the internal RAM, making a [[flat memory model|flat model]], if the display is used, its buffer must reside somewhere within the first 128&nbsp;KB of RAM (from where it is mirrored at address 0xB8000).  Stock MS-DOS is not prepared to work around the video buffer in low RAM, using RAM both below and above it.  Two obvious solutions exist: Use the additional memory as a [[RAM drive]], or not use the built-in 128&nbsp;KB.<ref name=\"norton19840626\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGkuDrOYjOcC&lpg=PA407&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Adding to Junior's Memory | work=PC Magazine | date=June 26, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=98}}</ref>  Another option would be to load a special DOS device driver or TSR, which would claim the RAM selected for use as the video buffer, causing DOS to load other drivers and programs above it.  A fourth option would be not to use MS-DOS, or to use a specially modified version of it.  For programs running from ROM cartridges, not using DOS was a very viable option, even in the mid-1980s when the PCjr was being marketed.\n[[File:IBM PC Jr BASIC Cartridge.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr BASIC Cartridge]]\n\n===Differences from other personal computers===\nThe PCjr initially shipped with a wireless [[chiclet keyboard]] called the \"Freeboard\",<ref name=\"halfhill198410\"/> powered by four AA batteries to provide infrared line-of-sight wireless communication.

The standing statue of [[William Ewart Gladstone]] (1894, for the City Liberal Club, London) is to be regarded as one of Ford's better portrait works.
