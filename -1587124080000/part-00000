Baltic languages are spoken by the [[Balts]], mainly in areas extending east and southeast of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Northern Europe]].\n\nScholars usually regard them as a single [[language family]] divided into two groups: '''Western Baltic''' (containing only [[extinct language]]s) and '''Eastern Baltic''' (containing three [[living language]]s, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]). The range of the Eastern Baltic linguistic influence once possibly reached as far as the [[Ural Mountains]], but this hypothesis has been questioned.<ref>Marija Gimbutas 1963. The Balts.

However, these two branches are sometimes classified as independent branches of [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]].<ref name=\"Glottolog3\" />\n[[File:Slavic languages tree.svg|thumb|right|300px|Balto-Slavic languages]]\n\n===Western Baltic languages \u2020===\n* (Western) [[Galindian language|Galindian]] \u2020\n* [[Old Prussian language|Old Prussian]] \u2020\n* [[Sudovian language|Sudovian]] ([[Yotvingian]]) \u2020\n* ?

Baltic territory was extensive far inland.]]\n{{Indo-European topics}}\nIt is believed that the Baltic languages are among the [[conservative (language)|most archaic]] of the currently remaining Indo-European languages, despite their late [[Attested language|attestation]].\n\nAlthough the various Baltic tribes were mentioned by [[ancient historians]] as early as 98 B.C.,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} the first attestation of a Baltic language was {{Circa}} 1369, in a Basel [[epigram]] of two lines written in Old Prussian. Lithuanian was first attested in a printed book, which is a [[Catechism]] by [[Martynas Ma\u017evydas]] published in 1547. Latvian appeared in a printed Catechism in 1585.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXxdDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA34|title=The Foundations of Latin|last=Baldi|first=Philip|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|date=2002|pp=34\u201335|isbn=3-11-016294-6}}</ref>\n\nOne reason {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} for the late attestation is that the Baltic peoples [[Northern Crusades|resisted Christianization]] longer than any other Europeans, which delayed the introduction of writing and isolated their languages from outside influence.\n\nWith the establishment of a [[History of Germany|German]] state in Prussia, and the eradication or flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population in the 13th century, the remaining Prussians began to be assimilated, and by the end of the 17th century, the Prussian language had become extinct.\n\nDuring the years of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569\u20131795), official documents were written in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and [[Latin]].\n\nAfter the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of Commonwealth]], most of the Baltic lands were under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]], where the native languages or alphabets were sometimes prohibited from being written down or used publicly in a [[Russification]] effort (see [[Lithuanian press ban]] for the ban in force from 1865 to 1904).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:Baltic languages.png|thumb|left|Distribution of the Baltic languages in the Baltic (simplified)]]\nSpeakers of modern Baltic languages are generally concentrated within the borders of [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]], and in emigrant communities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and the countries within the former borders of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nHistorically the languages were spoken over a larger area: west to the mouth of the [[Vistula]] river in present-day [[Poland]], at least as far east as the [[Dniepr]] river in present-day [[Belarus]], perhaps even to [[Moscow]], and perhaps as far south as [[Kiev]]. Key evidence of Baltic language presence in these regions is found in [[hydronym]]s (names of bodies of water) that are characteristically Baltic. The use of hydronyms is generally accepted to determine the extent of a culture's influence, but ''not'' the date of such influence.\n\nThe [[Mordvinic languages]], spoken mainly along western tributaries of the [[Volga]], show several dozen loanwords from one or more Baltic languages. These may have been mediated by contacts with the Eastern Balts along the river [[Oka River|Oka]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Riho|last=Gr\u00fcnthal|chapter=Baltic loanwords in Mordvin|title=A Linguistic Map of Prehistoric Northern Europe|date=2012|pages=297\u2013343|chapter-url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust266/sust266_grunthal.pdf|series=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Toimituksia 266}}</ref>\n\nThe eventual expansion of the use of [[Slavic languages]] in the south and east, and [[Germanic languages]] in the west, reduced the geographic distribution of Baltic languages to a fraction of the area that they formerly covered. The Russian geneticist Oleg Balanovsky speculated that there is a predominance of the assimilated pre-Slavic substrate in the genetics of East and West Slavic populations, according to him the common genetic structure which contrasts East Slavs and Balts from other populations may suggest that the pre-Slavic substrate of the [[East Slavs]] consists most significantly of Baltic-speakers, which predated the Slavs in the cultures of the [[Eurasian steppe]] according to archaeological references he cites.<ref>{{cite book |last1=\u041f

and personal or place names. All of the languages in the Baltic group (including the living ones) were first written down relatively late in their probable existence as distinct languages. These two factors combined with others have obscured the history of the Baltic languages, leading to a number of theories regarding their position in the Indo-European family.\n\nThe Baltic languages show a close relationship with the Slavic languages, and are grouped with them in a [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] family by most scholars. This family is considered to have developed from a common ancestor, [[Proto-Balto-Slavic]]. Later on, several lexical, phonological and morphological dialectisms developed, separating the various Balto-Slavic languages from each other.<ref name=\"Mallory1991\">{{cite book |author=J. P.

Proto-Baltic is then thought to have split into East Baltic and West Baltic branches. However, more recent scholarship has suggested that there was no unified Proto-Baltic stage, but that Proto-Balto-Slavic split directly into three groups: Slavic, East Baltic and West Baltic.<ref>{{citation |last=Kortlandt |first=Frederik |author-link=Frederik Kortlandt |year=2009 |title=Baltica & Balto-Slavica |page=5 |quote=Though Prussian is undoubtedly closer to the East Baltic languages than to Slavic, the characteristic features of the Baltic languages seem to be either retentions or results of parallel development and cultural interaction.

This would imply that Proto-Baltic, the last common ancestor of all Baltic languages, would be identical to Proto-Balto-Slavic itself, rather than distinct from it. In the 1960s [[Vladimir Toporov]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] made the following conclusions about the relationship between the Baltic and Slavic languages: a) Proto-Slavic language formed from the peripheral-type Baltic dialects; b) Slavic linguistic type formed later from the Baltic languages structural model; c) the Slavic structural model is a result of the Baltic languages structural model transformation. These scholars' theses do not contradict the Baltic and Slavic languages closeness and from a historical perspective specify the Baltic-Slavic languages evolution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dini |first=P.U. |title=Balt\u0173 kalbos.

Balto-Slavic), the Dacian and the \"[[Pelasgian]]\" languages.

The cognates of the [[List of reconstructed Dacian words|reconstructed Dacian words]] in his publication are found mostly in the Baltic languages, followed by Albanian.

Baltic languages are spoken by the [[Balts]], mainly in areas extending east and southeast of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Northern Europe]].\n\nScholars usually regard them as a single [[language family]] divided into two groups: '''Western Baltic''' (containing only [[extinct language]]s) and '''Eastern Baltic''' (containing three [[living language]]s, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]). The range of the Eastern Baltic linguistic influence once possibly reached as far as the [[Ural Mountains]], but this hypothesis has been questioned.<ref>Marija Gimbutas 1963. The Balts.

Lithuanian was first attested in a printed book, which is a [[Catechism]] by [[Martynas Ma\u017evydas]] published in 1547. Latvian appeared in a printed Catechism in 1585.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXxdDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA34|title=The Foundations of Latin|last=Baldi|first=Philip|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|date=2002|pp=34\u201335|isbn=3-11-016294-6}}</ref>\n\nOne reason {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} for the late attestation is that the Baltic peoples [[Northern Crusades|resisted Christianization]] longer than any other Europeans, which delayed the introduction of writing and isolated their languages from outside influence.\n\nWith the establishment of a [[History of Germany|German]] state in Prussia, and the eradication or flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population in the 13th century, the remaining Prussians began to be assimilated, and by the end of the 17th century, the Prussian language had become extinct.\n\nDuring the years of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569\u20131795), official documents were written in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and [[Latin]].\n\nAfter the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of Commonwealth]], most of the Baltic lands were under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]], where the native languages or alphabets were sometimes prohibited from being written down or used publicly in a [[Russification]] effort (see [[Lithuanian press ban]] for the ban in force from 1865 to 1904).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:Baltic languages.png|thumb|left|Distribution of the Baltic languages in the Baltic (simplified)]]\nSpeakers of modern Baltic languages are generally concentrated within the borders of [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]], and in emigrant communities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and the countries within the former borders of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nHistorically the languages were spoken over a larger area: west to the mouth of the [[Vistula]] river in present-day [[Poland]], at least as far east as the [[Dniepr]] river in present-day [[Belarus]], perhaps even to [[Moscow]], and perhaps as far south as [[Kiev]]. Key evidence of Baltic language presence in these regions is found in [[hydronym]]s (names of bodies of water) that are characteristically Baltic. The use of hydronyms is generally accepted to determine the extent of a culture's influence, but ''not'' the date of such influence.\n\nThe [[Mordvinic languages]], spoken mainly along western tributaries of the [[Volga]], show several dozen loanwords from one or more Baltic languages. These may have been mediated by contacts with the Eastern Balts along the river [[Oka River|Oka]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Riho|last=Gr\u00fcnthal|chapter=Baltic loanwords in Mordvin|title=A Linguistic Map of Prehistoric Northern Europe|date=2012|pages=297\u2013343|chapter-url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust266/sust266_grunthal.pdf|series=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Toimituksia 266}}</ref>\n\nThe eventual expansion of the use of [[Slavic languages]] in the south and east, and [[Germanic languages]] in the west, reduced the geographic distribution of Baltic languages to a fraction of the area that they formerly covered. The Russian geneticist Oleg Balanovsky speculated that there is a predominance of the assimilated pre-Slavic substrate in the genetics of East and West Slavic populations, according to him the common genetic structure which contrasts East Slavs and Balts from other populations may suggest that the pre-Slavic substrate of the [[East Slavs]] consists most significantly of Baltic-speakers, which predated the Slavs in the cultures of the [[Eurasian steppe]] according to archaeological references he cites.<ref>{{cite book |last1=\u041f

and personal or place names. All of the languages in the Baltic group (including the living ones) were first written down relatively late in their probable existence as distinct languages. These two factors combined with others have obscured the history of the Baltic languages, leading to a number of theories regarding their position in the Indo-European family.\n\nThe Baltic languages show a close relationship with the Slavic languages, and are grouped with them in a [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] family by most scholars. This family is considered to have developed from a common ancestor, [[Proto-Balto-Slavic]]. Later on, several lexical, phonological and morphological dialectisms developed, separating the various Balto-Slavic languages from each other.<ref name=\"Mallory1991\">{{cite book |author=J. P.

Proto-Baltic is then thought to have split into East Baltic and West Baltic branches. However, more recent scholarship has suggested that there was no unified Proto-Baltic stage, but that Proto-Balto-Slavic split directly into three groups: Slavic, East Baltic and West Baltic.<ref>{{citation |last=Kortlandt |first=Frederik |author-link=Frederik Kortlandt |year=2009 |title=Baltica & Balto-Slavica |page=5 |quote=Though Prussian is undoubtedly closer to the East Baltic languages than to Slavic, the characteristic features of the Baltic languages seem to be either retentions or results of parallel development and cultural interaction.

This would imply that Proto-Baltic, the last common ancestor of all Baltic languages, would be identical to Proto-Balto-Slavic itself, rather than distinct from it. In the 1960s [[Vladimir Toporov]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] made the following conclusions about the relationship between the Baltic and Slavic languages: a) Proto-Slavic language formed from the peripheral-type Baltic dialects; b) Slavic linguistic type formed later from the Baltic languages structural model; c) the Slavic structural model is a result of the Baltic languages structural model transformation. These scholars' theses do not contradict the Baltic and Slavic languages closeness and from a historical perspective specify the Baltic-Slavic languages evolution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dini |first=P.U. |title=Balt\u0173 kalbos.

They argue that the many similarities and shared innovations between Baltic and Slavic are due to several millennia of contact between the groups, rather than shared heritage.<ref name=\"HockJoseph1996\">{{cite book |author1=Hans Henrich Hock |author2=Brian D.

Balto-Slavic), the Dacian and the \"[[Pelasgian]]\" languages.

The cognates of the [[List of reconstructed Dacian words|reconstructed Dacian words]] in his publication are found mostly in the Baltic languages, followed by Albanian. Parallels have enabled linguists, using the techniques of [[comparative linguistics]], to decipher the meanings of several Dacian and Thracian placenames with, they claim, a high degree of probability. Of 74 [[Dacian\u2013Baltic connection|Dacian placenames]] attested in primary sources and considered by Duridanov, a total of 62 have Baltic cognates, most of which were rated \"certain\" by Duridanov.{{sfn|Duridanov|1969|pp=95\u201396}} For a big number of 300 [[Thracian language#A Thracian or Thraco-Dacian branch of Indo-European|Thracian geographic names]] most parallels were found between Thracian and Baltic geographic names in the study of Duridanov.{{sfn|Duridanov|1976}}{{sfn|Duridanov|1985}}{{sfn|Duridanov|1976}} According to him the most important impression make the geographic cognates of Baltic and Thracian \"''the similarity of these parallels stretching frequently on the main element and the suffix simultaneously, which makes a strong impression''\".{{sfn|Duridanov|1985}}{{sfn|Duridanov|1969}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Historical linguistics]]\n* [[Dacian\u2013Baltic connection]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite web|url=http://www.lituanus.org/1996/96_3_03.htm|title=Lithuania 1863\u20131893: Tsarist Russification and the Beginnings of the Modern Lithuanian National Movement \u2013 Strazas|website=www.lituanus.org|access-date=5 October 2017}}\n* [[Ernst Fraenkel (linguist)|Ernst Fraenkel]] (1950) ''Die baltischen Sprachen'', Carl Winter, Heidelberg, 1950\n* Joseph Pashka (1950) [http://www.suduva.com/virdainas/proto.htm Proto Baltic and Baltic languages]\n* [http://www.lituanus.org/main.php?id=search-articles-linguistics Lituanus Linguistics Index] (1955\u20132004) provides a number of articles on modern and archaic Baltic languages\n* Mallory, J.

The city is abbreviated ''Y\u01d2ng'' ({{lang|zh-hans|\u752c}}) for the eponymous \"Yong Hill\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u752c\u5c71}}), a prominent coastal hill near the city, and the [[Yong River]] that flows through Ningbo. (The abbreviation Ning is used more commonly for [[Nanjing]].)\n\nIt was once named ''M\u00edngzh\u014du'' ({{lang|zh-hant|\u660e\u5dde}}). The character ''ming'' ({{lang|zh-hans|\u660e}}) is composed of two parts, representing two lakes inside the city wall: Sun Lake ({{lang|zh-hant|\u65e5\u6e56}}) and Moon Lake ({{lang|zh-hant|\u6708\u6e56}}). Today, only Moon Lake remains.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Ningbo}}\nNingbo is one of China's oldest cities, with a history dating to the [[Hemudu culture]] in 4800 BC. Ningbo was known as a trade city on the [[silk road]] at least two thousand years ago, and then as a major port for foreign trade along with [[Yangzhou]] and [[Guangzhou]] in the [[Tang Dynasty]], and [[Quanzhou]] and [[Guangzhou]] in the [[Sung dynasty]].\n\n===Tang and Song dynasty===\n\n[[File:Tianfeng Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Tianfeng Tower, originally built during the Tang Dynasty, is the symbol of old Ningbo.]]\n[[File:A rock garden inside Tianyi Chamber.JPG|thumb|left|A rock garden inside Tianyi Chamber]]\n\nSince the [[Tang dynasty]] Ningbo has been an important commercial port.

By 1542, the Portuguese had a sizable community in Ningbo (or, more likely, on nearby small islands such as [[Shuangyu]]). Portuguese activities from their Ningbo base included pillaging and attacking multiple Chinese port cities around Ningbo for plunder and spoil. They also enslaved people during their raids.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZdCAAAAYAAJ&q=1,200+portuguese+neighbouring+pillaging\n|title=Modern history of China\n|volume=\n|year=1983\n|author=Serge\u012d Leonidovich Tikhvinski\u012d\n|publisher=[[Progress Publishers]]\n|edition=\n|location=\n|isbn=\n|page=57\n|pages=\n|quote=Thereafter they made the factory near Ningbo their chief trading outlet.

During the war, British forces briefly took possession of the walled city of Ningbo after storming the fortified town of [[Zhenhai District|Zhenhai]] at the mouth of the Yong River on October 10, 1841.

Since the late 1980s, 16 bridges have been built on the three rivers. Currently another 27 bridges are under construction.\n\nThe [[Hangzhou Bay Bridge]], a combination [[cable-stayed bridge]] and causeway across Hangzhou Bay, opened to the public on May 1, 2008.

The new railway line was finished by 2013 and reduced travel time between Ningbo and Hangzhou to 50 minutes.\n\nThe [[Ningbo\u2013Taizhou\u2013Wenzhou Railway]] is a high-speed railway that opened in September 2009.

More lines are under construction. Line 3 is scheduled to be finished in the year 2019 and Line 4 in 2020. Future plans are for 7 metro lines serving Ningbo.\n\n==Military==\nNingbo is the headquarters of the [[East Sea Fleet]] of the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army Navy]]. Its responsibility includes projecting force in the region around the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]), which the People's Republic of China views as a renegade province.\n\n==Culture==\nAs a city with giant ports, Ningbo influenced many countries near China, such as Japan.\n\n===Language===\n{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=February 2020}}\nNingbo speech is a dialect of [[Wu Chinese]] that has preserved many aspects of ancient Chinese phonology. Its original wording mode can be found in classical reference books. It can be found that the trisyllable and tetrasyllable phrases or proverbs in Ningbo dialect make it most unusual and dynamic. Moreover, the onomatopoeia, assonance words, collocations, inversions, and other language characteristics within Ningbo dialect all add spice to people's{{Who|date=May 2017}} life.  After the [[unequal treaty]] port opening, western culture gradually permeated Ningbo. Thus the prefix \"\u6d0b yang\" before the nouns of imported goods is a special language phenomenon of Ningbo dialect.<ref>{{Cite web|script-title=zh:\u5b81\u6ce2\u8001\u8bdd\u6982\u8ff0|url = http://gtoc.ningbo.gov.cn/art/2013/9/9/art_10490_467452.html|website = gtoc.ningbo.gov.cn|access-date = 2015-09-09|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151017163123/http://gtoc.ningbo.gov.cn/art/2013/9/9/art_10490_467452.html|archivedate = 2015-10-17}}</ref>\n\n===Food===\nNingbo is known for Ningbo [[Tangyuan (food)|Tangyuan]], small stuffed buns which are boiled. The stuffing is usually ground sesame mixed with sugar. It can also be mixed with pork fat. The stuffing is wrapped with sticky rice powder.\nEven more so, Ningbo is famous throughout China for its seafood. Seafood markets are abundant, carrying countless varieties of fish, crabs/lobsters/shrimp, shellfish, snails, jellyfish and other invertebrates, and sea vegetables in all stages of preparation from \"still swimming,\" to cleaned and ready to cook, to fully cooked.\n\n===Festivals===\nNingbo has many traditional [[Han Chinese]] festivals same as other provinces in China. However, the date of Mid-Autumn Festival is different from others. Han Chinese will have Mid-Autumn Festival on Lunar Calendar August 15, but Ningbo will have on August 16th. The most creditable history for this is that long ago, the whole city waited for Shih Hao, a [[Southern Sung]] prime minister.{{clarify|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Education==\nBy the end of 2013, there were 2,097 schools of all levels in total, with 1,334,000 students.

By 1542, the Portuguese had a sizable community in Ningbo (or, more likely, on nearby small islands such as [[Shuangyu]]).

During the war, British forces briefly took possession of the walled city of Ningbo after storming the fortified town of [[Zhenhai District|Zhenhai]] at the mouth of the Yong River on October 10, 1841. The British subsequently repulsed a Chinese attempt to retake the city in the [[Battle of Ningpo]] on March 10, 1842. In 1861, the forces of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] took the city relatively unopposed as the defending garrison fled; they held the town for six months.<ref>{{cite book|title=Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom}}</ref> In March 1885, during the [[Sino-French War]], Admiral Courbet's naval squadron blockaded several Chinese warships in Zhenhai Bay and exchanged fire with the shore defenses.\n\nNingbo was also once famed for traditional Chinese furniture production.

In 2006, Ningbo Port started its expansion towards the neighboring island city of [[Zhoushan]] for the purpose of building an even larger port with higher capacity to compete with neighboring ports in the region, such as [[Shanghai]]'s Yangshan Deep-Water Port. The statistics in 2010 showed that total cargo throughput was 627,000,000 tons and container throughput 13,144,000 TEUs.

The Ling Bridge which connects Haishu district and Jiangdong District is the earliest modern bridge built in Ningbo, designed by German engineers. Since the late 1980s, 16 bridges have been built on the three rivers.

The new railway line was finished by 2013 and reduced travel time between Ningbo and Hangzhou to 50 minutes.\n\nThe [[Ningbo\u2013Taizhou\u2013Wenzhou Railway]] is a high-speed railway that opened in September 2009.

Its responsibility includes projecting force in the region around the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]), which the People's Republic of China views as a renegade province.\n\n==Culture==\nAs a city with giant ports, Ningbo influenced many countries near China, such as Japan.\n\n===Language===\n{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=February 2020}}\nNingbo speech is a dialect of [[Wu Chinese]] that has preserved many aspects of ancient Chinese phonology. Its original wording mode can be found in classical reference books. It can be found that the trisyllable and tetrasyllable phrases or proverbs in Ningbo dialect make it most unusual and dynamic. Moreover, the onomatopoeia, assonance words, collocations, inversions, and other language characteristics within Ningbo dialect all add spice to people's{{Who|date=May 2017}} life.  After the [[unequal treaty]] port opening, western culture gradually permeated Ningbo. Thus the prefix \"\u6d0b yang\" before the nouns of imported goods is a special language phenomenon of Ningbo dialect.<ref>{{Cite web|script-title=zh:\u5b81\u6ce2\u8001\u8bdd\u6982\u8ff0|url = http://gtoc.ningbo.gov.cn/art/2013/9/9/art_10490_467452.html|website = gtoc.ningbo.gov.cn|access-date = 2015-09-09|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151017163123/http://gtoc.ningbo.gov.cn/art/2013/9/9/art_10490_467452.html|archivedate = 2015-10-17}}</ref>\n\n===Food===\nNingbo is known for Ningbo [[Tangyuan (food)|Tangyuan]], small stuffed buns which are boiled. The stuffing is usually ground sesame mixed with sugar. It can also be mixed with pork fat. The stuffing is wrapped with sticky rice powder.\nEven more so, Ningbo is famous throughout China for its seafood. Seafood markets are abundant, carrying countless varieties of fish, crabs/lobsters/shrimp, shellfish, snails, jellyfish and other invertebrates, and sea vegetables in all stages of preparation from \"still swimming,\" to cleaned and ready to cook, to fully cooked.\n\n===Festivals===\nNingbo has many traditional [[Han Chinese]] festivals same as other provinces in China. However, the date of Mid-Autumn Festival is different from others. Han Chinese will have Mid-Autumn Festival on Lunar Calendar August 15, but Ningbo will have on August 16th. The most creditable history for this is that long ago, the whole city waited for Shih Hao, a [[Southern Sung]] prime minister.{{clarify|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Education==\nBy the end of 2013, there were 2,097 schools of all levels in total, with 1,334,000 students.

In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Characteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref> ILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood.

Therefore, inflammation associated with obesity can influence the progression of liver disease, due to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> ILC1s as a key regulatory of adipose tissue inflammation, is therefore a potential therapeutic target for treating people with liver disease or [[metabolic syndrome]]. \n\nILC2s have also been identified in human and mouse [[white adipose tissue]], contributing to the development of obesity.
