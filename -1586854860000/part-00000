The activities that can be performed are varied, among them hiking, horseback riding, snorkeling, spearfishing, fishing, and observation of flora and fauna, which is mostly endemic.

Historian [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] discussed identity politics extensively in his 1991 book ''[[The Disuniting of America]]''.  Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of [[civil rights]], argues that a [[liberal democracy]] requires a common basis for [[culture]] and [[society]] to function. Rather than seeing civil society as already fractured along lines of power and powerlessness (according to race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc), Schlesinger suggests that basing politics on group marginalization is itself what fractures the civil polity, and that identity politics therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization. Schlesinger believes that:\n{{quote|movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than \u2026 perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference.<ref>M.A. Chaudhary & Gautam Chaudhary, Global Encyclopaedia of Political Geography, New Delhi, 2009, {{ISBN|978-81-8220-233-7}}, p. 112</ref>}}\n\nSimilarly [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] has suggested that identity politics causes (rather than simply recognizing and acting on) political schisms along lines of social identity. Thus, he contrasts the politics of [[gay liberation]] and identity politics by saying:\n{{quote|[[Peter Tatchell|[Peter] Tatchell]] also had, back in the day, \u2026 a commitment to the politics of liberation, which encouraged gays to come out and live and engage. Now, we have the politics of identity, which invites people to stay in, to look inward, to obsess over the body and the self, to surround themselves with a moral forcefield to protect their worldview\u2014which has nothing to do with the world\u2014from any questioning.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brendan|first1=O'Neill|title=Identity politics has created an army of vicious, narcissistic cowards|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|work=The Spectator|access-date=28 June 2015|date=19 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630173221/http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|archive-date=30 June 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\nIn these and other ways, a political perspective oriented to one's own well being can be recast as causing the divisions that it insists upon making visible.\n\nIn this same vein, author [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] argues that identity politics often marginalize the [[working class]], saying that: {{quote|In the 1950s and 1960s, left-wing intellectuals who were both inspired and informed by a powerful labour movement wrote hundreds of books and articles on working-class issues.

Of course, the struggles for the emancipation of women, gays, and ethnic minorities are exceptionally important causes. New Labour has co-opted them, passing genuinely progressive legislation on gay equality and women's rights, for example.

Historian [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] discussed identity politics extensively in his 1991 book ''[[The Disuniting of America]]''.  Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of [[civil rights]], argues that a [[liberal democracy]] requires a common basis for [[culture]] and [[society]] to function. Rather than seeing civil society as already fractured along lines of power and powerlessness (according to race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc), Schlesinger suggests that basing politics on group marginalization is itself what fractures the civil polity, and that identity politics therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization. Schlesinger believes that:\n{{quote|movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than \u2026 perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference.<ref>M.A. Chaudhary & Gautam Chaudhary, Global Encyclopaedia of Political Geography, New Delhi, 2009, {{ISBN|978-81-8220-233-7}}, p. 112</ref>}}\n\nSimilarly [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] has suggested that identity politics causes (rather than simply recognizing and acting on) political schisms along lines of social identity. Thus, he contrasts the politics of [[gay liberation]] and identity politics by saying:\n{{quote|[[Peter Tatchell|[Peter] Tatchell]] also had, back in the day, \u2026 a commitment to the politics of liberation, which encouraged gays to come out and live and engage. Now, we have the politics of identity, which invites people to stay in, to look inward, to obsess over the body and the self, to surround themselves with a moral forcefield to protect their worldview\u2014which has nothing to do with the world\u2014from any questioning.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brendan|first1=O'Neill|title=Identity politics has created an army of vicious, narcissistic cowards|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|work=The Spectator|access-date=28 June 2015|date=19 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630173221/http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|archive-date=30 June 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\nIn these and other ways, a political perspective oriented to one's own well being can be recast as causing the divisions that it insists upon making visible.\n\nIn this same vein, author [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] argues that identity politics often marginalize the [[working class]], saying that: {{quote|In the 1950s and 1960s, left-wing intellectuals who were both inspired and informed by a powerful labour movement wrote hundreds of books and articles on working-class issues. Such work would help shape the views of politicians at the very top of the Labour Party. Today, progressive intellectuals are far more interested in issues of identity. ... Of course, the struggles for the emancipation of women, gays, and ethnic minorities are exceptionally important causes. New Labour has co-opted them, passing genuinely progressive legislation on gay equality and women's rights, for example.

Shortly after leaving that school, Tonon found an advertisement for [[Tom DeBlass]]' academy, Ocean County Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and decided to continue his training there. While still attending high school, Tonon would consistently attend two classes per day at DeBlass' academy. DeBlass, noticing Tonon's interest in the sport, began bringing Tonon to [[Ricardo Almeida]]'s academy for additional training.<ref>{{cite web |title=Garry Tonon |url=https://www.bjjheroes.com/bjj-fighters/garry-tonon |website=BJJ Heroes |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Grappling career==\nIn 2008, after about a year of consistent jiu-jitsu training with DeBlass and Almeida, Tonon won his first title at the IBJJF World Championships in the Blue Belt Juvenile Division.<ref>{{cite web |title=WORLD JIU-JITSU CHAMPIONSHIP 2008 \u2013 RESULTS |url=https://ibjjf.com/results/world-jiu-jitsu-championship-2008-results/ |website=IBJJF |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> After graduating high school in 2009, Tonon began pursuing a degree in exercise science at [[Rutgers University]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Presley |first1=Richard |title=Garry Tonon - Fighter Profile |url=https://www.attacktheback.com/garry-tonon/ |website=Attack the Back |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> While studying at Rutgers, Tonon maintained a rigorous training schedule and continued to compete in both local and international competitions, mostly competing in the gi for the first 5 years of his training, but later beginning to seek out more specialized, no-gi instruction from John Danaher.

Tonon continued to wrestle for several more years, through his freshman year of high school. Tonon has credited wrestling & martial arts with helping him to cope with his ADHD, and partially attributes his particular style of grappling to the disorder.<ref>{{cite web |title=Garry Tonon: Grappling With ADHD |url=https://evolve-mma.com/blog/garry-tonon-grappling-with-adhd/ |website=Evolve MMA |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> He attended [[Lacey Township High School]] in [[Lacey Township, New Jersey]], where he later graduated in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Procida |first1=Lee |title=Lacey students note long list of accomplishments |url=https://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/local/lacey-students-note-long-list-of-accomplishments/article_de5fbd33-969c-572b-bc9e-ec5a308df840.html |website=Press of Atlantic City |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt age 14, a friend decided to bring Tonon to a local jiu-jitsu tournament, which interested Tonon. He soon began taking classes at his friend's jiu-jitsu academy, but lost interest after several months due to the school's focus on mixed martial arts, as opposed to jiu-jitsu. Shortly after leaving that school, Tonon found an advertisement for [[Tom DeBlass]]' academy, Ocean County Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and decided to continue his training there. While still attending high school, Tonon would consistently attend two classes per day at DeBlass' academy. DeBlass, noticing Tonon's interest in the sport, began bringing Tonon to [[Ricardo Almeida]]'s academy for additional training.<ref>{{cite web |title=Garry Tonon |url=https://www.bjjheroes.com/bjj-fighters/garry-tonon |website=BJJ Heroes |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Grappling career==\nIn 2008, after about a year of consistent jiu-jitsu training with DeBlass and Almeida, Tonon won his first title at the IBJJF World Championships in the Blue Belt Juvenile Division.<ref>{{cite web |title=WORLD JIU-JITSU CHAMPIONSHIP 2008 \u2013 RESULTS |url=https://ibjjf.com/results/world-jiu-jitsu-championship-2008-results/ |website=IBJJF |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> After graduating high school in 2009, Tonon began pursuing a degree in exercise science at [[Rutgers University]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Presley |first1=Richard |title=Garry Tonon - Fighter Profile |url=https://www.attacktheback.com/garry-tonon/ |website=Attack the Back |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> While studying at Rutgers, Tonon maintained a rigorous training schedule and continued to compete in both local and international competitions, mostly competing in the gi for the first 5 years of his training, but later beginning to seek out more specialized, no-gi instruction from John Danaher.
