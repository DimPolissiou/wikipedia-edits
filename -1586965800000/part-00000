On 18 March 1965, he became the first human to conduct a [[spacewalk]], exiting the [[Space capsule|capsule]] during the [[Voskhod 2]] mission for 12 minutes and 9 seconds.\n\nIn July 1975, Leonov commanded the [[Soyuz program|Soyuz capsule]] in the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project|Soyuz\u2013Apollo]] mission, which docked in space for two days with an American [[Apollo command and service module|Apollo capsule]].\n\n== Early life and military service ==\nLeonov was born on 30 May 1934 in [[Tisulsky District|Listvyanka]], [[West Siberian Krai]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]].{{sfn|Burgess|Hall|2009|p=54}} His grandfather had been forced to relocate to Siberia for his role in the [[1905 Russian Revolution]].

Leonov wrote in his autobiography: \"He was not alone: many were being arrested. It was part of a conscientious drive by the authorities to eradicate anyone who showed too much independence or strength of character. These were the years of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|purges]]. Many disappeared into remote [[gulag]]s and were never seen again.\"{{sfn|Scott|Leonov|2004|p=8}} The family moved in with one of his married sisters in [[Kemerovo]]. His father rejoined the family in Kemerovo after he was released. He was compensated for his wrongful imprisonment.{{sfn|Burgess|Hall|2009|p=55}} Leonov used art as a way to provide more food for the family. He began his art career by drawing flowers on ovens and later painted landscapes on canvasses.{{sfn|Burgess|Hall|2009|p=55}}\n\nThe Soviet government encouraged its citizens to move to Soviet-occupied Prussia, so in 1948 his family relocated to [[Kaliningrad]].{{sfn|Burgess|Hall|2009|p=56}} Leonov graduated from secondary school (No. 21) in 1953.{{sfn|Burgess|Hall|2009|p=56}} He applied to the Academy of Arts in [[Riga]], Latvia, but decided not to attend due to the high tuition costs. Leonov decided to join a Ukrainian preparatory flying school in [[Kremenchug]]; he made his first solo flight in May 1955. While indulging in his passion for art by studying part-time in Riga, Leonov started an advanced two-year course to become a fighter pilot at the [[Chuhuiv|Chuguev]] Higher Air Force Pilots School in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].{{sfn|Burgess|Hall|2009|p=56}}\n\nOn 30 October 1957, Leonov graduated with an honours degree and was commissioned a [[Ranks and insignia of the Soviet Armed Forces 1955\u20131991#Army officers and generals (all services)|lieutenant]] in the 113th Parachute Aviation Regiment, part of the 10th Engineering Aviation Division of the [[17th Air Army#Post War Reorganization|69th Air Army]] in [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Burgess|Hall|2009|p=56}} On 13 December 1959, he married Svetlana Pavlovna Dozenko<ref name=\"astronaut.ru\" /> a day before he moved to East Germany to his new assignment with the 294th Reconnaissance Regiment of the [[16th Air Army|24th Air Army]].{{sfn|Burgess|Hall|2009|p=56}}\n\n== Soviet space programme ==\n[[File:RIAN archive 888102 Soviet cosmonauts.jpg|left|thumb|Alexei Leonov (left, back row) with fellow cosmonauts in 1965]]\n\nHe was one of the 20 [[Soviet Air Forces]] pilots selected to be part of the first cosmonaut training group in 1960.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50017409|title=Alexei Leonov: First person to walk in space dies aged 85|website=BBC News|publisher=|date=11 October 2019|accessdate=11 October 2019}}</ref> As most cosmonauts, Leonov was a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

This was cancelled because of delays in achieving a reliable circumlunar flight (only the later [[Zond 7]] and [[Zond 8]] members of the programme were successful) and the [[Apollo 8]] mission had already achieved that step in the [[Space Race]].

(The design required a spacewalk between lunar vehicles, something that contributed to his selection.) Leonov was to have been commander of the 1971 [[Soyuz 11]] mission to [[Salyut 1]], the first crewed space station, but his crew was replaced with the backup after one of the members, cosmonaut [[Valery Kubasov]], was suspected to have contracted [[tuberculosis]] (the other member was [[Pyotr Kolodin]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americaspace.com/2014/02/20/valeri-kubasov-veteran-astp-cosmonaut-dies-aged-79/|title=Valeri Kubasov, Veteran ASTP Cosmonaut, Dies Aged 79|first=Ben|last=Evans|date=20 February 2014|accessdate=11 October 2019|website=America Space|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLeonov was to have commanded the next mission to [[Salyut 1]], but this was scrapped after the deaths of the Soyuz 11 crew members, and the space station was lost.{{sfn|Hall|Shayler|2003|p=173}} The next two Salyuts (actually the military [[Almaz]] station) were lost at launch or failed soon after, and Leonov's crew stood by.

Though credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], the song was written and composed by [[John Lennon]]{{sfn|Sheff|2000|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=421,497}} during [[The Beatles in India|the Beatles' retreat]] in [[Rishikesh]], [[India]]. The song is a parody of [[blues]] music, specifically English imitators of blues.\n\n== Composition ==\nLennon said that, while \"trying to reach God and feeling suicidal\" in India, he wanted to write a [[blues]] song, but was unsure if he could imitate the likes of [[Sleepy John Estes]] and other original blues artists he had listened to in school. In \"Yer Blues,\" he alludes to this insecurity with a reference to the character Mr. Jones from [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Ballad of a Thin Man]],\" and with the third verse, which draws on [[Robert Johnson]]'s \"[[Hellhound on My Trail]].\" Instead, Lennon wrote and composed \"Yer Blues\" as a parody of British imitators of the blues, featuring [[tongue-in-cheek]] guitar [[solo (music)|solo]]s and [[rock and roll]]-inspired [[swing blues]] [[passage (music)|passages]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=170}}\n\nThe half-satirical, half-earnest song mockingly acknowledges the [[British blues#The British blues boom|British blues boom]] of 1968 and the debate among the [[music press]] at the time of whether white men could sing the blues.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=307}} According to [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]], the song's \"ponderous earnestness&nbsp;... belies the composer's satirical tone.\"{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=170}} In the chorus, Lennon sings, \"If I ain't dead already, girl you know the reason why.\" The writer Jonathan Gould interprets this to be a \"joke [in] that nobody knows the reason why\u2014or, for that matter, what any of these bluesy poetics are really supposed to mean.\" Gould called \"Yer Blues\" an example of the \"cultural realism\" that distinguished the Beatles from their musical contemporaries in Britain: \"[T]heir acceptance of the idea that, except as a subject of self-parody, certain expressive modes of [[African-American music]] lay outside the realm of their experience and hence beyond their emotional range as singers.\"{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=520}}\n\n==Recording==\n\"Yer Blues\" was recorded in EMI Studio Two's \"annexe,\" which was actually a large closet in the control room.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=148}} In 2016, [[Paul McCartney]] recalled, \"We were talking about this tightness, this packed-in-a-tin thing. So we got in a little cupboard \u2013 a closet that had microphone leads and things, with a drum kit, amps turned to the walls, one mic for John. We did 'Yer Blues' live and it was really good.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Paul McCartney Looks Back: The Rolling Stone Interview |work=Rolling Stone |location=USA |date=10 August 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2016 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/paul-mccartney-looks-back-the-rolling-stone-interview-w433437}}</ref> The song is in the key of E major, but like many blues numbers, it prominently features [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]], such as G{{music|natural}}, D{{music|natural}}, and B{{music|flat}}. It is primarily in a {{music|time|6|8}} meter, but as with several of Lennon's tunes, the time signature and tempo are altered many times.<ref>[http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/yb.shtml Notes on \"Yer Blues\"], [[Alan W. Pollack]]</ref> In interviews for ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' series, [[Ringo Starr]] affectionately recalls recording this song in the stripped-down conditions, saying it was like the old days of live performances by the Beatles. The stripped-down, bluesy nature of the number bears similarity to much of Lennon's early solo output, including \"[[Cold Turkey]]\" and his 1970 ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'' album and marks a retreat from the concerns that Lennon had with such studio experimentation as had marked such songs as \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\" and \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]].\" The track, along with \"[[Glass Onion]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Mean Mr. Mustard]]\" and \"[[Sun King (song)|Sun King]]\", is one of few Beatles songs on which [[Paul McCartney]] used a 1966 Fender Jazz Bass rather than his better-known 1963 H\u00f6fner 500/1 Violin Bass or his 1964 Rickenbacker 4001S-LH (Fire-glo) bass. Contributing to the live sound of the recording, loud yelling between band members can be heard in the instrumental tracks.\n\n==Live performance==\nJust after the album ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' came out in late 1968, Lennon performed a 4:27{{refn|group=nb|4:26 on DVD.}} rendition of \"Yer Blues\" at ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' with a supergroup dubbed \"[[The Dirty Mac]],\" consisting of himself, [[Eric Clapton]] on lead guitar, [[Keith Richards]] on bass, and [[Mitch Mitchell]] of the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]] on drums.<ref>{{youtube|Iuy-10Ejck4|John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Mitch Mitchell-Yer Blues}}</ref> The performance was followed with a 4:49{{refn|group=nb|5:03 on DVD.}} boogie instrumental [[Jam session|jam]] called \"Whole Lotta Yoko,\" featuring dissonant avant-garde violinist [[Ivry Gitlis]] and vocals by [[Yoko Ono]]. The recording was never originally broadcast, and for decades this performance was only available through [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] recording. It was finally officially released, on both CD and video, in 1996. Lennon's performance with the Dirty Mac was his first live performance since the Beatles' last concert in 1966 and may have contributed to his renewed enthusiasm for live performances in 1969. (See \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\" and ''[[Live Peace in Toronto]].'')\n\n==Legacy==\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of ''[[The Independent]]'' listed \"Yer Blues\" at number eight in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He wrote of the song: \"This track sees Lennon take on the blues to deliver a song that stands tall among the greats he attempted to emulate (see: [[Sleepy John Estes]], [[John Lee Hooker]]).

Though credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], the song was written and composed by [[John Lennon]]{{sfn|Sheff|2000|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=421,497}} during [[The Beatles in India|the Beatles' retreat]] in [[Rishikesh]], [[India]]. The song is a parody of [[blues]] music, specifically English imitators of blues.\n\n== Composition ==\nLennon said that, while \"trying to reach God and feeling suicidal\" in India, he wanted to write a [[blues]] song, but was unsure if he could imitate the likes of [[Sleepy John Estes]] and other original blues artists he had listened to in school. In \"Yer Blues,\" he alludes to this insecurity with a reference to the character Mr. Jones from [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Ballad of a Thin Man]],\" and with the third verse, which draws on [[Robert Johnson]]'s \"[[Hellhound on My Trail]].\" Instead, Lennon wrote and composed \"Yer Blues\" as a parody of British imitators of the blues, featuring [[tongue-in-cheek]] guitar [[solo (music)|solo]]s and [[rock and roll]]-inspired [[swing blues]] [[passage (music)|passages]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=170}}\n\nThe half-satirical, half-earnest song mockingly acknowledges the [[British blues#The British blues boom|British blues boom]] of 1968 and the debate among the [[music press]] at the time of whether white men could sing the blues.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=307}} According to [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]], the song's \"ponderous earnestness&nbsp;... belies the composer's satirical tone.\"{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=170}} In the chorus, Lennon sings, \"If I ain't dead already, girl you know the reason why.\" The writer Jonathan Gould interprets this to be a \"joke [in] that nobody knows the reason why\u2014or, for that matter, what any of these bluesy poetics are really supposed to mean.\" Gould called \"Yer Blues\" an example of the \"cultural realism\" that distinguished the Beatles from their musical contemporaries in Britain: \"[T]heir acceptance of the idea that, except as a subject of self-parody, certain expressive modes of [[African-American music]] lay outside the realm of their experience and hence beyond their emotional range as singers.\"{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=520}}\n\n==Recording==\n\"Yer Blues\" was recorded in EMI Studio Two's \"annexe,\" which was actually a large closet in the control room.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=148}} In 2016, [[Paul McCartney]] recalled, \"We were talking about this tightness, this packed-in-a-tin thing. So we got in a little cupboard \u2013 a closet that had microphone leads and things, with a drum kit, amps turned to the walls, one mic for John. We did 'Yer Blues' live and it was really good.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Paul McCartney Looks Back: The Rolling Stone Interview |work=Rolling Stone |location=USA |date=10 August 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2016 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/paul-mccartney-looks-back-the-rolling-stone-interview-w433437}}</ref> The song is in the key of E major, but like many blues numbers, it prominently features [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]], such as G{{music|natural}}, D{{music|natural}}, and B{{music|flat}}. It is primarily in a {{music|time|6|8}} meter, but as with several of Lennon's tunes, the time signature and tempo are altered many times.<ref>[http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/yb.shtml Notes on \"Yer Blues\"], [[Alan W. Pollack]]</ref> In interviews for ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' series, [[Ringo Starr]] affectionately recalls recording this song in the stripped-down conditions, saying it was like the old days of live performances by the Beatles. The stripped-down, bluesy nature of the number bears similarity to much of Lennon's early solo output, including \"[[Cold Turkey]]\" and his 1970 ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'' album and marks a retreat from the concerns that Lennon had with such studio experimentation as had marked such songs as \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\" and \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]].\" The track, along with \"[[Glass Onion]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Mean Mr. Mustard]]\" and \"[[Sun King (song)|Sun King]]\", is one of few Beatles songs on which [[Paul McCartney]] used a 1966 Fender Jazz Bass rather than his better-known 1963 H\u00f6fner 500/1 Violin Bass or his 1964 Rickenbacker 4001S-LH (Fire-glo) bass. Contributing to the live sound of the song, loud yelling between band members can be heard in the instrumental tracks.\n\n==Live performance==\nJust after the album ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' came out in late 1968, Lennon performed a 4:27{{refn|group=nb|4:26 on DVD.}} rendition of \"Yer Blues\" at ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' with a supergroup dubbed \"[[The Dirty Mac]],\" consisting of himself, [[Eric Clapton]] on lead guitar, [[Keith Richards]] on bass, and [[Mitch Mitchell]] of the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]] on drums.<ref>{{youtube|Iuy-10Ejck4|John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Mitch Mitchell-Yer Blues}}</ref> The performance was followed with a 4:49{{refn|group=nb|5:03 on DVD.}} boogie instrumental [[Jam session|jam]] called \"Whole Lotta Yoko,\" featuring dissonant avant-garde violinist [[Ivry Gitlis]] and vocals by [[Yoko Ono]]. The recording was never originally broadcast, and for decades this performance was only available through [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] recording. It was finally officially released, on both CD and video, in 1996. Lennon's performance with the Dirty Mac was his first live performance since the Beatles' last concert in 1966 and may have contributed to his renewed enthusiasm for live performances in 1969. (See \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\" and ''[[Live Peace in Toronto]].'')\n\n==Legacy==\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of ''[[The Independent]]'' listed \"Yer Blues\" at number eight in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He wrote of the song: \"This track sees Lennon take on the blues to deliver a song that stands tall among the greats he attempted to emulate (see: [[Sleepy John Estes]], [[John Lee Hooker]]).

Some operating systems, such as the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]], provide native support for animated wallpapers.\n\n=== Microsoft ===\n====Windows====\nModern [[Windows]] systems can be configured to cycle through pictures from a folder at regular intervals. Windows does not natively support animated backgrounds, however, third-party software can be installed to have full support for placing animated images, video files, 2D or 3D scenes and web pages as wallpapers. Similar functionality could be found in the [[Active Desktop]] feature of [[Windows 98]] and later versions.\n\n=== Google ===\n\n====Android====\nLive wallpapers have been introduced in [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.0 (Eclair) to provide native support for animated wallpapers. From a technical point of view, live wallpapers are software applications which provide a moving background image and may allow for user interaction or utilize other hardware and software features within the device (accelerometer, GPS, network access, etc.).<ref>{{cite web|title=Live Wallpapers (Technical Article)|url=http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/live-wallpapers.html|work=developer.android.com|accessdate=5 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Apple===\n\n====macOS====\n[[macOS]] has built-in support, via the Desktop & Screen Saver panel in its System Preferences, for cycling through a folder collection of images on a timed interval or when logging in or waking from sleep.
