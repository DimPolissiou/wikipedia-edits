Originally scheduled for April 10, 2020, the album's release was delayed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]<!-- December 31 is just a placeholder date for digital music retailers -->. ''Chromatica'' will serve as a follow-up to Gaga's fifth studio album ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'' (2016), and her first full-length release since the [[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] for the film ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (2018). \n\nOn February 25, 2020, Gaga announced \"[[Stupid Love (Lady Gaga song)|Stupid Love]]\" as the album's [[lead single]], released on February 28, 2020.\n\n==Background==\nIn press interviews after it was announced she would embark on one final performance of her 2016 [[Dive Bar Tour (Lady Gaga)|Dive Bar Tour]], Gaga hinted new music would be performed and released during the new leg's stop.

The earlier recording sessions have been attributed to [[post-production]] work for the [[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to [[Bradley Cooper]]'s ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]'', a remake of the [[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|1937 film of the same name]] in which she has top billing. The later recording sessions have mostly been attributed to further production for ''Chromatica''. Producer [[BloodPop]], who had co-produced every song on the standard edition of Gaga's previous studio album ''Joanne'' (2016), shared on various social media platforms that he and Gaga had been recording at the singer's Malibu estate with German electronic music producer [[Boys Noize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8356693/lady-gaga-boys-noize |title=Lady Gaga & Boys Noize Are Working Together in the Studio|last=Bein|first=Kat|date=April 19, 2018|accessdate=May 8, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420182625/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8356693/lady-gaga-boys-noize |archivedate=April 20, 2018|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> BloodPop continued to post similar updates through the entirety of 2019 and January 2020, indicating production had continued for nearly three years.

So I have a house where it's [[Frank Zappa|Frank Zappa's]] old [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen|studio]], it's a live room, it's a big studio, it's beautiful. And I would be upstairs on the porch, outside the kitchen, and Bloodpop would come up and he'd go, 'Okay, come on, that's enough, off the porch,' and I would cry and I would say, 'I'm miserable, I'm sad, I\u2019m depressed,' and he'd go, 'I know, and we're gonna go make some music now. And then I'd go downstairs and I would write. This album is such a display of not only how you can reframe the way that you view the world, but I promise and I hope, that the love that was around me in the process of making this album is something that other people feel, that they know that artistically, like, you know how producers are, if one guy\u2019s working on it, or one girl\u2019s working on it, they don\u2019t want anyone else to work on it, they don\u2019t wanna share, they, everybody gets cocky, there was none of that. These records got passed around to so many different people, there were so many different iterations of these songs because we all wanted it to be perfect and literally nobody cared who put their fingerprints on it, as long as it was the dopest thing that we could give to the world and that it was meaningful, authentic, and completely me.<ref name=\"Beats1\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' released in March 2020, Gaga talked at length about numerous topics, including the recording process for ''Chromatica'', and confirmed that BloodPop was the \"center\" and her \"nucleus\" of production while creating the album and that he had a hand in the creation of every track.<ref name=\"Paper1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html |title=Lady Gaga: Life on Chromatica |last=Moran |first=Justin |date=March 16, 2020 |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]}}</ref> It was also confirmed in the same interview that Gaga worked with a wide array of producers and musicians, such as [[Burns (musician)|Burns]], [[Axwell]] of [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Tchami]], Benjamin Rice, and [[Rami Yacoub]], to create an album described as an \"[[electronic music|electronic]] [[tapestry]]\u201d by the interviewer.<ref name=\"Paper1\"/> In discussing the large collaborative atmosphere that enveloped the album's production, she said, \"It's easy to go into a computer and find a cool loop, but the producers I work with don't work this way.

It's two women having a conversation about how to keep going and how to be grateful for what you do.\"<ref name=\"Paper1\"/>\n\n==Title and packaging==\nTalking about the album's title, Gaga stated \"I live on Chromatica, that is where I live. I went into my frame. I found earth, I deleted it. Earth is canceled. I live on Chromatica.\" A temporary cover art was released along with the album preorder, showcasing a symbol which \"has a [[sine wave]] in it, which is the mathematical symbol for sound.

And then I'd go downstairs and I would write. This album is such a display of not only how you can reframe the way that you view the world, but I promise and I hope, that the love that was around me in the process of making this album is something that other people feel, that they know that artistically, like, you know how producers are, if one guy\u2019s working on it, or one girl\u2019s working on it, they don\u2019t want anyone else to work on it, they don\u2019t wanna share, they, everybody gets cocky, there was none of that. These records got passed around to so many different people, there were so many different iterations of these songs because we all wanted it to be perfect and literally nobody cared who put their fingerprints on it, as long as it was the dopest thing that we could give to the world and that it was meaningful, authentic, and completely me.<ref name=\"Beats1\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' released in March 2020, Gaga talked at length about numerous topics, including the recording process for ''Chromatica'', and confirmed that BloodPop was the \"center\" and her \"nucleus\" of production while creating the album and that he had a hand in the creation of every track.<ref name=\"Paper1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html |title=Lady Gaga: Life on Chromatica |last=Moran |first=Justin |date=March 16, 2020 |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]}}</ref> It was also confirmed in the same interview that Gaga worked with a wide array of producers and musicians, such as [[Burns (musician)|Burns]], [[Axwell]] of [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Tchami]], Benjamin Rice, and [[Rami Yacoub]], to create an album described as an \"[[electronic music|electronic]] [[tapestry]]\u201d by the interviewer.<ref name=\"Paper1\"/> In discussing the large collaborative atmosphere that enveloped the album's production, she said, \"It's easy to go into a computer and find a cool loop, but the producers I work with don't work this way.

These locations are today part of the nations of [[Malaysia]] (Malay [[nation state]]), [[Brunei]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]] and Southern [[Thailand]].\n\nThere is considerable genetic, linguistic, cultural, artistic, and social diversity among the many Malay subgroups, mainly due to hundreds of years of immigration and assimilation of various regional ethnicity and tribes within [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Historically, the Malay population is descended primarily from the earlier [[Malayic languages|Malayic]]-speaking Austronesians and [[Austroasiatic]] tribes who founded several ancient maritime trading states and kingdoms, notably [[History of Brunei|Brunei]], [[Kedah Kingdom|Kedah]], [[Langkasuka]], [[Gangga Negara]], [[Chi Tu]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Old Pahang Kingdom|Pahang]], [[Melayu Kingdom|Melayu]] and [[Srivijaya]].<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=24, 33}}</ref><ref name=\"Barnard 2004 7\">{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=7&60}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] in the 15th century triggered a major revolution in Malay history, the significance of which lies in its far-reaching political and cultural legacy. Common definitive markers of a [[Malayness]] \u2013 the religion of [[Islam]], the [[Malay language]] and traditions \u2013 are thought to have been promulgated during this era, resulting in the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Malay as a major  [[ethnoreligious group]] in the region.{{sfn|Melayu Online|2005}} In literature, architecture, [[Malay cuisine|culinary traditions]], traditional dress, performing arts, martial arts, and royal court traditions, Malacca set a standard that later Malay sultanates emulated. The golden age of the [[Malay sultanate]]s in the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]] saw many of their inhabitants, particularly from various tribal communities like the [[Batak]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], [[Orang Asli]] and the [[Orang Laut]] become subject to [[Islamisation]] and [[Malayisation]].{{sfn|Milner|2010|pp=200, 232}}  Today, some Malays have recent forebears from other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, termed as ''anak dagang'' (\"traders\") and who predominantly consist of [[Banjar people|Banjar]], [[Bugis]],  [[Minangkabau people]] and [[Acehnese people]]s, while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other countries.{{sfn|Milner|2010|p=10 & 185}}\n\nThroughout their history, the Malays have been known as a coastal-trading community with fluid cultural characteristics.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=131}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|pp=7, 32, 33 & 43}}</ref> They [[Trans-cultural diffusion|absorbed]], [[Intercultural communication principles|shared]] and [[Cultural learning|transmitted]] numerous cultural features of other local ethnic groups, such as those of Minang, Acehnese, and to some degree [[Javanese culture]]; however Malay culture differs by being more overtly Islamic than the multi-religious Javanese culture.

The term is thought to be derived from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''melaju'', a combination of the verbal [[prefix]] 'me' and the [[root word]] 'laju', meaning \"to accelerate\", used to describe the accelerating strong current of the river.<ref>{{harvnb|Abdul Rashid Melebek|Amat Juhari Moain|2006|pp=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nThe word \"Melayu\" as an [[ethnonym]], to allude to a clearly different ethnological cluster, is assumed to have been made fashionable throughout the integration of the Malacca Sultanate as a regional power in the 15th century.

The ancient folk religion vividly characterised that every elements of nature possessed a spirit, known as ''semangat''.

Rebellions against the Javanese rule ensued and attempts were made by the fleeing Malay princes to revive the empire, which left the area of southern Sumatra in chaos and desolation.

Between the 13th to early 14th century, the kingdom succeeded to incorporate most of the Malay Peninsula under its mandala. The campaign led by [[Chandrabhanu Sridhamaraja]] (1230\u20131263) managed to capture [[Jaffna kingdom]] in [[Sri Lanka]] between 1247 and 1258.

Brunei also expanded its influence in Mindanao, [[Philippines]] when Sultan Bolkiah married Leila Macanai, the daughter of the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]]. However, states like the [[Huangdom of Pangasinan]], [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] and [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]] tried to resist Brunei's and Islam's spread into the Philippines. Brunei's fairly loose river based governmental presence in Borneo projected the process of [[Malayisation]]. Fine Malay Muslim cultures, including the language, dress and single-family dwelling were introduced to the natives primarily from ethnic [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], drawing them into the Sultanate. Dayak chiefs were incorporated into the Malay hierarchy, being given the official titles of ''[[Datuk]]'', ''[[Temenggong]]'' and ''Orang Kaya''.

The sultanate would be abolished almost half a century later in 1911 by the Dutch powers, following a strong independence movement manifested in the nation against the [[Dutch East Indies|colonial government]].]]\n\nBetween 1511 and 1984, numerous Malay kingdoms and sultanates fell under direct [[colonisation]] or became the [[protectorate]]s of different foreign powers, from European colonial powers like [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom|British]], to regional powers like [[Siam]] and [[Japan]].\nIn 1511, the [[Portuguese Empire]] [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|captured]] the capital city of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. The victorious Portuguese however, were unable to extend their political influence beyond the [[A Famosa|fort of Malacca]]. The Sultan maintained his overlordship on the lands outside Malacca and established the [[Johor Sultanate]] in 1528 to succeed Malacca. [[Portuguese Malacca]] faced several unsuccessful retaliation attacks by Johor until 1614, when the combined forces of Johor and the [[Dutch Empire]], [[Battle of Malacca (1641)|ousted]] the Portuguese from the peninsula. As per agreement with Johor in 1606, the Dutch later took control of Malacca.<ref>{{harvnb|Hunter|Roberts|2010|p=345}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, [[Malay states]] of the peninsular had a hostile relation with the [[Thai people|Siamese]]. Malacca sultanate herself fought two wars with the Siamese while northern Malay states came intermittently under Siamese dominance for centuries. In 1771, the [[Thonburi Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] under the new [[Chakri Dynasty]] abolished the [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani Sultanate]] and later annexed a large part of [[Kedah Sultanate]]. Earlier, the Siamese under [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] have had already absorbed [[Tambralinga]] and overrun the [[Singgora Sultanate]] in the 17th century. Between 1808\u20131813, the Siamese imposed a new administrative structure and created the [[Satellite state|semi-independent]] Malay kingdoms of [[Pattani Kingdom|Patani]], [[Sai Buri District|Saiburi]], [[Nong Chik District|Nongchik]], [[Yaring District|Yaring]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Reman]] and [[Rangae]] from [[Patani (region)|Greater Pattani]] and similarly obtained [[Ranong province|Rundung]], [[Takua Pa District|Kupa]], [[Phuket province|Tongkah]], [[Trang Province|Terang]] while carving [[Setul Kingdom|Setul]], Langu, [[Perlis]], [[Kubang Pasu Kingdom|Kubang Pasu]] from the [[Kedah Kingdom]] in 1839.<ref>{{harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|pp=62\u201368}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ganguly|1997|p=204}}</ref> In 1902, the Siamese stripped the political powers of all the 7 kingdoms of Pattani following a planned revolt for independence against the central government.

In 1819, the company also acquired [[Singapore]] from [[Johor Empire]], later in 1824, [[Dutch Malacca]] from the Dutch, and followed by [[Straits Settlements#Dindings and Province Wellesley|Dindings]] from [[Perak]] by 1874. All these trading posts officially known as [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 and became the crown colony of [[British Empire]] in 1867. British intervention in the affairs of Malay states was formalised in 1895, when [[Malay rulers]] accepted [[British Resident]]s in administration, and the [[Federated Malay States]] was formed. In 1909, [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] were [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|handed over]] by Siam to the British. These states along with [[Johor]], later became known as [[Unfederated Malay States]]. During the [[World War II]], all these British possessions and protectorates that collectively known as [[British Malaya]] were occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\nThe twilight of the vast Bruneian Empire began during the [[Castille War]] against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] conquistadors which arrived at the Philippines from Mexico. The war resulted in the end of the empire's dominance in the present-day [[Philippine archipelago]]. The decline further culminated in the 19th century, when the Sultanate lost most of its remaining territories in [[Borneo]] to the [[White Rajah]]s of [[Sarawak]], [[North Borneo Chartered Company]] and its [[Kalimantan|lower Borneo]] vassals to [[Dutch East India Company]]. Brunei was a British protectorate from 1888 to 1984.<ref name=\"CIA (B)\">{{harvnb|CIA World Factbook|t=Brunei|2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] which divided the [[Malay Archipelago]] into a British zone in the north and a Dutch zone in the south, all Malay sultanates in [[Sumatra]] and [[Kalimantan|Southern Borneo]] became part of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Though some of Malay sultans maintain their power under Dutch control,<ref>{{harvnb|Lumholtz|2004|p=17}}</ref> some were abolished by the Dutch government under the accusation of retaliation against the colonial rule, like the case of Palembang Sultanate in 1823, Jambi Sultanate in 1906 and [[Riau Sultanate]] in 1911.\n\n[[File:Sultans at the first Malayan Durbar.jpg|thumb|The [[Malay Rulers]] and nobilities of Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak and Selangor with [[British Malaya|British colonial officers]] during the first [[Conference of Rulers|Durbar]] in Istana Negara, [[Kuala Kangsar]], [[Perak]], [[Federated Malay States]], 1897.]]\nA similar partition of the [[Malay Peninsular|Peninsular]] was also replicated by the British and the Siamese in wake of the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]]. This was done after the British alarmed by the growing influence between Siamese government and rivaling [[German colonial empire]], especially in the northern Peninsular. The Anglo-Siamese Treaty attested that the Siamese to control the [[Southern Thailand|upper portion]] of the peninsular while the lower region was to be held under the [[British Empire|British dominance]]. The British originally planned for the inclusion of [[Kingdom of Reman|Reman]], Legeh and [[Kingdom of Setul|Setul]] under their dominion together with a cluster of northern Malay states. Nonetheless, they only managed to secure [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] under the agreement. The treaty also witnessed the state of Kedah being reduced the most, with [[Tarutao National Park|Tarutao]], [[Tarutao National Park|Butang islands]] groups, [[Sadao District|Sendawa]], [[La-ngu District|Langgu]] and the principality of [[Setul Kingdom|Setul]] were all being divorced into the Siamese hands, a similar fate was also followed in northeastern coast of Kelantan that was demanded to renounced their right on the [[Tak Bai District|Tabal district]], including [[Su-ngai Kolok District|Sungai Golok]] and [[Su-ngai Padi District|Sungai Padi]]; while [[Perlis]] lost its Pujoh district. Then-British controlled [[Federated Malay States|Federated Malay State]] of [[Perak]] however, saw an enlargement of their land area, with [[Hulu Perak|southern territories]] of [[Reman]] being transferred into the state and additionally Kelantan received [[Jeli District|Jeli]] from Legeh (which had been under Siamese jurisdiction since 1902). The Siamese then [[abdicated]] Tunku Baharuddin, the [[Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara|King of Setul]], the sole Malay kingdom remained under Siamese territory in 1916. The treaty nonetheless, manage to sealed the fate of the Malay states of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] to retain a degree of their sovereign powers under the [[British Malaya|British colonial government]], a legacy that can be witnessed today in the Malaysian administrative system.\n\nLater during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]], [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|British Malaya]] and [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Borneo]], the Japanese maintained a favourable relationship with the Sultans and other Malay leaders, this is partially composed to foster the trust of the Malay public that was generally loyal towards the sultan. Nonetheless, in a series of massacres known as [[Pontianak incidents]], the Japanese assassinated virtually all of the [[West Kalimantan]] Malay sultans, including a large numbers of Malay intelligentsias after they have been falsely accused of planning an uprising and [[coup d'etat]] against the Japanese.

In the [[Netherlands Indies]], the struggle against colonisation was characterised by the trans-ethnic nationalism: the so-called \"[[Indonesian National Awakening]]\" united people from the various parts of the Dutch colony in the development of a national consciousness as \"Indonesians\".<ref name=\"Ricklefs, pp. 163-164\">Ricklefs, pp. 163\u2013164.</ref> In Brunei, despite some attempt made to arouse Malay political consciousness between 1942 and 1945, there was no significant history of ethnic-based nationalism. In Thailand however, [[South Thailand insurgency|Pattani separatism]] against Thai rule is regarded by some historians as a part of the wider sphere of peninsula Malay nationalism. A similar [[secession movement]] can be witnessed in modern-day Indonesia, where both autochthonously-Malay provinces of [[Riau]] and [[Riau Islands]] sought to gain independence under the name of Republic of Riau. Nevertheless, what follows is specific to the peninsula Malay nationalism that resulted in the formation of the [[Federation of Malaya]], later reconstituted as Malaysia.\n\nThe earliest and most influential instruments of Malay national awakening were the [[periodical]]s which politicised the position of the Malays in the face of colonialism and alien immigration of non-Malays. In spite of repressions imposed by the British colonial government, there were no less than 147 journals and newspapers published in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] between 1876 and 1941. Among notable periodicals were ''Al-Imam'' (1906), ''Pengasuh'' (1920), ''Majlis'' (1935) and ''[[Utusan Melayu]]'' (1939). The rise of [[Malay nationalism]] was largely mobilised by three nationalist factions \u2013 the radicals distinguishable into the Malay left and the Islamic group which were both opposed to the conservative elites.<ref name=\"Leo Suryadinata\">{{harvnb|Suryadinata|2000|pp=133\u2013136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Malaya stamp.png|thumb|left|Federation of Malaya's commemorative stamp issued in 1957. The semi-independent federation was formed in 1948 from nine [[Malay states]] and two British [[Straits Settlements]]. It [[Hari Merdeka|achieved independence]] in 1957.]]\nThe Malay [[leftist]]s were represented by [[Kesatuan Melayu Muda]], formed in 1938 by a group of Malay intelligentsia primarily educated in [[Sultan Idris Training College]], with an ideal of ''[[Greater Indonesia]]''. In 1945, they reorganised themselves into a political party known as Partai Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (PKMM). The [[Islamist]]s were originally represented by ''Kaum Muda'' consisted of Middle east \u2013educated scholars with [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] sentiment. The first Islamic political party was ''Partai Orang Muslimin Malaya'' (Hizbul Muslimin) formed in March 1948, later succeeded by [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|Pan-Malayan Islamic Party]] in 1951. The third group was [[Conservatism|the conservatives]] consisted of the westernised elites who were bureaucrats and members of royal families that shared a common English education mostly at the exclusive [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]]. They formed voluntary organisations known as ''Persatuan Melayu'' ('Malay Associations') in various parts of the country with the primary goals of advancing and protecting the interests of Malays. In March 1946, 41 of these Malay associations formed [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), to assert [[Malay dominance]] over Malaya.<ref name=\"Leo Suryadinata\"/>\n\nThe Malay and [[Malayness]] has been the fundamental basis for Malay ideology and Malay nationalism in Malaysia. All three Malay nationalist factions believed in the idea of a ''Bangsa Melayu'' ('Malay Nation') and the position of Malay language, but disagreed over the role of Islam and Malay rulers. The conservatives supported [[Malay language]], [[Malay Islamic identity|Islam]] and [[Malay rulers|Malay monarchy]] as constituting the key pillars of Malayness, but within a secular state that restricted the political role of Islam. The leftists concurred with the [[secular state]] but wanted to end [[feudalism]], whereas the Islamic group favoured ending royalty but sought a much larger role of [[Islam]].<ref>{{harvnb|Barrington|2006|pp=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Spandoeken tijdens het bezoek van de Wali Negara Sumatera Timur aan Pematangsiantar TMnr 60024766.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Supporters of ''Negara Soematra Timoer'' ([[State of East Sumatra]]) that sought to maintain the monarchy system in [[Aftermath of World War II#Dutch East Indies|post-World War II]] Dutch-established territory of East Sumatra.

The new movement forged a close political link between rulers and subjects never before achieved. It generated an excited Malay public opinion which, together with the surprising political apathy of the non-Malays, led to Britain's abandonment of the radical [[Malayan Union]] plan. By July, UMNO succeeded in obtaining an agreement with the British to begin negotiations for a new constitution. Negotiations continued from August to November, between British officials on the one hand, and the Sultans' representatives and UMNO and the other.<ref name=\"Riwanto Tirtosudarmo\">{{harvnb|Tirtosudarmo|2005}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later the semi independent [[Federation of Malaya]] was born. The new constitutional arrangement largely reverted to the basic pattern of pre-war colonial rule and built on the supremacy of the individual Malay states. Malay rights and privileges were safeguarded. The traditional [[Malay rulers]] thus retained their prerogatives, while their English-educated descendants came to occupy positions of authority at the centre, which was being progressively decolonised. In August 1957, the [[Federation of Malaya]], the West's last major dependency in Southeast Asia, attained independence in a peaceful transfer of power.<ref name=\"Riwanto Tirtosudarmo\"/> The federation was reconstituted as [[Malaysia]] with the addition in 1963 of [[Singapore]] (separated in 1965), [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]].\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Language===\n[[File:Prasasti Kedukan Bukit 3.jpg|thumb|The [[Kedukan Bukit Inscription]] written in [[Vatteluttu|Pallava script]].

Among the forms of poetry in Malay literature are \u2013 the [[Pantun]], [[Syair]] and [[Gurindam]].\n\nThe earliest form of Malay literature was the [[oral literature]] and its central subjects are traditional [[folklore]] relating to [[nature]], animals and people. The classical Malay folklore is composed of traditional songs and music, heroic poems, animal fables, ghost stories, past events, fairy tales, symbolic lore, myths and bardic tales. Each of the stories possessed its own energy in terms of character, spirit, backdrop and storytelling and was largely crafted with the intend of happiness, guidance, educating, reminiscing, explaining, among few. The folklore were memorised and passed from one generation of storytellers to the next. Many of these tales were also written down by ''penglipur lara'' (storytellers) for example: ''[[Hikayat Malim Dewa]]'', ''Hikayat Malim Deman'', ''Hikayat Raja Donan'', ''Hikayat Anggun Cik Tunggal'', and ''[[Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda]]''.\n\nWhen Indian influences made their way to the Malay Archipelago around 2000 years ago, Malay literature began incorporating Indian elements. Literature of this time is mostly translations of [[Sanskrit literature]] and romances, or at least some productions inspired by such, and is full of allusions to [[Hindu mythology]]. Probably to this early time may be traced such works as ''[[Hikayat Seri Rama]]'' (a free translation of the ''[[Ramayana]]''), ''[[Hikayat Bayan Budiman]]'' (an adaptation of [[\u015aukasaptati]]) and ''[[Hikayat Panca Tanderan]]'' (an adaptation of ''[[Hitopadesha]]'').<ref name=\"popular science 1899\">{{harvnb|Ford|1899|pp=379\u2013381}}</ref>\n\nThe era of classical Malay literature started after the arrival of Islam and the invention of [[Jawi script]] (Arabic based Malay script). Since then, Islamic beliefs and concepts began to make its mark on Malay literature. The [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]], which is dated to 1303, is the earliest known narrative Malay writing. The stone is inscribed with an account of history, law, and [[romance (love)|romance]] in Jawi script.<ref name=\"Marshall Cavendish 2007 1218\">{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1218}}</ref> At its height, the Malacca Sultanate was not only the center of Islamisation, but also the center of Malay cultural expressions including literature.

The natural tropical settings where flora and fauna and cosmic forces is abundant has inspired the motives to be depict in abstract or styled form into the timber board. With the coming of Islam, geometric and [[Islamic calligraphy]] form were introduced in the wood carving. The woods used are typically from tropical hardwood species which is known to be durable and can resist the attacks of the fungi, power-boots beetles and termites.<ref>{{harvnb|Ismail Said|2002}}</ref>\n\nA typical Malay traditional houses or mosque would have been adorned with more than 20 carved components. The carving on the walls and the panels allow the air breeze to circulate effectively in and out of the building and can let the sunlight to light the interior of the structure. At the same time, the shadow cast by the panels would also create a shadow based on the motives adding the beauty on the floor.

Due to the vastness of various Malay kingdoms in the [[Malay archipelago|archipelago]], local and distinct forms of the Baju Kurung design patterns can also be witnessed in the region, including Bengkulu, Kedah, Jambi, Johor-Riau, Pahang and Palembang.<ref name=\"Hanisa Hassan 2016 1\"/>\n\nThe corresponding mode of Baju Kurung for men is known as \"Baju Melayu\". The upper part of the garment was made with the geometrical design almost similar with Baju Kurung and commonly paired with woven cloth known as the sarong. The pattern of the sarong may possessed a symbol of the person's marital status or the rank in the classical Malay society.<ref name=\"Hanisa Hassan 2016 1\"/>\n\nOther common classical Malay attire for men consists of a ''baju'' (shirt) or ''tekua'' (a type of a long sleeve shirt), ''baju rompi'' (vest), ''kancing'' (button), a small leg ''celana'' (trousers), a [[sarong]] worn around the waist, ''capal'' (sandal), and a ''tanjak'' or ''tengkolok'' ([[headgear]]); for the aristocrats, the ''baju sikap'' or ''baju layang'' (a type of coat) and ''pending'' (ornamental belt buckle) are also synonymous to be worn as a formal attire. It was also common for a ''pendekar'' (Malay warrior) to have a [[Kris]] tucked into the front fold of sarong.\n\nIn contrast to Baju Melayu which continued to be worn as ceremonial dress only, Baju Kurung is worn daily throughout the year by a majority of Malay women. Sighting of female civil servants, professional workers and students wearing Baju Kurung is common in Malaysia and Brunei.\n\n===Festivals and celebrations===\n[[File:Majlis Tujuh Likor Pasang Pelita.jpg|thumb|Rows of Pelita ([[oil lamps]]) lighted during ''Malam Tujuh Likur'' (the 27th night of [[Ramadhan]]), the oil lamps are traditionally used to illuminate homes and the streets during the Ramadhan. Seen here in [[Muar town|Muar]], Johor, Malaysia]]\nThe rise of [[Islam]] managed to [[ethnogenesis|redefine]] the [[Malayness|Malay identity]] by the 15th century. Thus, resulting most of the Malay festivals and celebrations to run parallel with the [[Islamic calendar]], albeit deeply ingrained with a strong sense of [[Malayisation|Malay character]]. The biannual [[Hari Raya]] (lit \"the Great Day\") observance of [[Aildifitri]] and [[Aidiladha]] are hailed as the grand celebrations universally across the Malay community. The two holidays are instrumental to commentate two major events and philosophy in the Islamic teaching and beliefs. The former signifies the triumph as a Muslim after a month of [[Fasting in Islam|fasting]] and patience in [[Ramadan]], while the latter is to observe the sacrifice made by [[Ibrahim]] (Abraham) under the name of [[Allah]].\n\nThe ''Raya'' holidays usually commenced during the [[wikt:homecoming|homecoming]] event known as [[Balik Kampung]] or ''Balik Raya'' which occurred a few days before the festival. During the Hari Raya, the Malays would celebrated by performing the [[Eid prayers]], holding a grand feast and visiting friends, relatives and neighbours. A visit to the grave of the departed loved ones is also essential, as a sign of respect, love and honour.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Plechtigheden bij de kroning van de Sultan van Deli in 1925 op de troon de sultan en zijn echtgenote met aan weerszijden de rijkssieraden TMnr 10001572.jpg|thumb|The coronation ceremony between Tengku Otteman, as the ''Tengku Mahkota'' (Crown Prince) of [[Sultanate of Deli|Deli Sultanate]] in Residency of Sumatra's East Coast, [[Dutch East Indies]]; with his wife, Raja Amnah, daughter of [[Raja Chulan]] and a member of [[Perak Sultanate|Perak Royalty]] as ''Tengku Puan Indera'' in 1925.]]\nOther major liturgical and religious ceremonies celebrated by the Malays include [[Ramadhan]], a month-long holy month devoted by daytime fasting and various religious activities; [[Maulidur Rasul]], a special grand procession to honour the birth of Prophet [[Muhammad]]; [[Ashura]], remembrance of [[Muharram]] where the Malays would solemnly prepared a special dish, known as ''Bubur Ashura''; [[Nisfu Syaaban]], the Mid-[[Sha'ban]] observance, a special day of [[fasting]] for forgiveness; [[Nuzul Quran]], the first the revelation of the [[Quran]]; [[Israk dan Mikraj]], the ascension Prophet Muhammed to the heavens and [[Awal Muharram]], the Islamic New Year; the latter three celebrations are usually observed by holding a special ''sunat'' prayers, religious lectures and Islamic discussions in the [[mosque]].\n\nThere are also a plethora of domestic regional cultural festivals and social events within different the Malay spheres. The coastal areas were historically known to observed the ''Mandi Safar'' or ''Puja Pantai'' ceremony, a purifying bath during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Safar]], originally emulated from the ancient pre-Islamic Malay holy cleansing rituals; and ''Pesta Menuai'', a [[harvest festival]] celebrated by the inland and agrarian Malay communities by traditional games, theatre, [[Joget]] and other repertoire of dance-play. However, both of the practice is gradually extinct owing from various social and economic revolution engineered in the Malay community in the 20th century. Additionally, many Malays are also known to participate in the imperial celebrations to honour the royal courts of their respective kingdoms.\n\nThe Islamic features also strongly embroidered the Malay celebrations in the individual level, a juxtaposition bonded to the spiritual [[rite of passage]] as a Muslim. The Malays would usually organised ''kenduri'', a religious ceremonial banquet to celebrate or to seek blessing for an event. There are several philosophical variations of kenduri, raging from ''Doa Selamat'' (asking for divine favour and protection), ''Kesyukuran'' (for thanksgiving and gratitude), ''Melenggang Perut'' (ceremonial massage for a mother who is pregnant with her first child), ''Aqiqah'' and ''Cukur Jambul'' (newborn ceremony, for celebrating a new life), ''Bertindik'' (the first piercing ceremony for a female child), ''Khatam'' (a graduation ceremony, after a child's first full-reading of the [[Quran]]), ''Khatan'' ([[circumcision]]),  ''Kahwin'' ([[wedding]]), ''Arwah'' or ''Tahlil'' (prayers for a deceased person),  among few. The event is usually organised by the family and was traditionally aided by the community in a social gathering known as ''Rewang'' or ''Gotong-royong''. During this ceremony, the whole family would be assisted by their neighbours and relatives, delegating various tasks raging from food preparations, venue management, logistic assembly and other technical control. Nevertheless, following the rise of [[urbanism]] in the contemporary Malay community, the practice of ''Rewang/Gotong-Royong'' is gradually superseded by hired-[[catering|caterer]] services by the family.\n\n===Martial arts===\n[[File:Silat Melayu Keris Lok 9.jpg|thumb|A [[Silat Melayu]] performance on a stage.]]\n{{Main|Silat|Silat Melayu}}\nSilat and its variants can be found throughout the Malay world: the [[Malay peninsula]] (including [[Singapore]]), the [[Riau Islands]], [[Sumatra]] and coastal areas of [[Borneo]]. Archaeological evidence reveals that, by the 6th century, formalised combat arts were being practised in the Malay peninsular and Sumatra.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1994|p=73}}</ref> The earliest forms of Silat are believed to have been developed and used in the armed forces of the ancient Malay kingdoms of [[Langkasuka]] (2nd century)<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=225}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Abd. Rahman Ismail|2008|p=188}}</ref> and Srivijaya (7th century).\n\nThe influence of the Malay sultanates of Malacca, [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]], [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani]] and [[Brunei Sultanate|Brunei]] has contributed to the spread of this martial art in the Malay Archipelago. Through a complex maze of sea channels and river capillaries that facilitated exchange and trade throughout the region, Silat wound its way into the dense rainforest and up into the mountains. The legendary [[Laksamana]] [[Hang Tuah]] of Malacca is one of the most renowned ''pesilat'' (Silat practitioners) in history<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2001|p=802}}</ref> and even considered by some as the father of Malay silat.<ref>{{harvnb|Sheikh Shamsuddin|2005|p=195}}</ref> Since the classical era, [[Silat Melayu]] underwent great diversification and formed what is today traditionally recognised as the source of Indonesian [[Pencak Silat]] and other forms of Silat in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{harvnb|Draeger|1992|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Farrer|2009|p=28}}</ref>\n\nApart from Silat, [[Tomoi]] is also practised by Malays, mainly in the northern region of the Malay peninsula. It is a variant of [[Indochina|Indo-Chinese]] forms of [[kickboxing]] which is believed to have been spread in the Southeast Asian mainland since the time of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan Empire]] (68&nbsp;AD).\n\n===Metal casting===\n[[File:Bunga Mas (Muzium Negara).jpg|thumb|The [[Bunga Mas]], [[National Museum of Malaysia]]. Literary translated as the \"Golden Flowers\", the Bunga Mas was offered by the northern Malay states of [[Terengganu]], [[Kelantan]], [[Kedah]], [[Patani Kingdom|Pattani]], [[Nong Chik District|Nong Chik]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Ra-ngae District|Rangae]], [[Kubang Pasu Darul Qiyam|Kubang Pasu]] and [[Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara|Setul]] to the King of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] ([[Siam]]) as a symbol of allegiance.]]\nIn the Malay society, classical [[metalworks]] assumed a role more than a mere instrumental tool. It serves as a testament of [[culture]], cultivated by [[art]]istic appreciation and [[religious]] symbol, molded by a craftsman who possessed a talent to redefined the essence of nature in the most ornamental manner. The artform has indeed received a long existence in the [[Malay World]], observations made by the [[Arab people|Arabs]] on the courts of [[Srivijaya]] narrated that about the abundance of golds in the [[Palembang|capital]], till the extend that the bars have to be ceremonially thrown into the [[estuary]] in a daily basis. On the Chinese accounts, the area was occasionally hailed as ''Jinzou'', the [[gold]] coast. The zenith of Srivijaya also witnessed the arrivals of [[silver]] bought by the foreign merchants, which then spread to the members of Malay aristocracy.<ref name=\"Shaffer 1955\">{{harvnb|Shaffer|1955}}</ref>\n\nUpon the turn of the 17th century, gold, silver, [[iron]] and [[brass]] have all been perfectly molded to become part and parcel to the Malay society. The era witnessed the works of metal received a critical royal patronage. A multitude of Malay metalworks manifested as evidence of this era, raging from a peculiar Malay dagger known as [[Keris]] made of iron, down to the elaborate fine [[jewellery]] made from the splendor of gold and silver. For the Malay nobles during this period, the works of pending (ornamental [[Belt buckle]] embellished with [[precious stones]]), ''keronsang'' (brooch) and ''cucuk sanggul'' (hairpins) were staged to become among the most sought item of fashion. The era also hosted a number of other prominent items in the Malay regalia cast in gold, including ceremonial box, ''Tepak sirih'' (Betel container) and parts of Keris. The art of casting gold were predominantly done by [[repouss\u00e9]] and [[Granulation (process)|granulation]] techniques, in which the traditional methods can still be witnessed until today. In the contemporary era, the Malay gold jewels are mainly found in the form of anklets, bracelets, rings, necklaces, pendants and earrings.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\">{{harvnb|Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass|2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Karyaneka 2013\">{{harvnb|Karyaneka|2013}}</ref>\n\nFor the Malay silverware, the works of silver are fairly known for its sophisticated and fine designs. It is usually crafted in the form of repousse, [[filigree]] and [[Niello|neillowork]]. Among the common traditional Malay items usually made of silver includes pillow ends, belt buckles, matt corners, stoppers for water vessels, Keris sheaths and tobacco boxes. The ''Awan Larat'' (cloud patterns) and ''Kerawang'' (Vegetal motives) are among the popular designs for Malay decorative silver pillow ends and tobacco boxes.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\"/>\n\nThe usage of brassware transcends a plethora of classical Malay social classes, being used by the members of nobility and commoners alike. The popularity of brassware is heavily contributed due to its durability, quality and affordability to all. The brassware can be narrowed into two distinctions, yellow brass for functional items and white for [[Ornamental brassware|decorative purposes]]. It is often meticulously hammered and craved with various decorative designs in [[Islamic arts|religious]] and floral motives. The usage of brass however, is best known for [[Tepak Sireh]], a ceremonial tray for betel quid and for constructing certain musical instruments such as [[Gong]]s for the classical Malay [[Gamelan]] orchestra. Additionally, other prominent traditional Malay items made from metal includes flower vases, perfume sprinkles, serving trays, cooking pots, kettle and incense burners.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\"/><ref name=\"Karyaneka 2013\"/>\n\n===Weaponry===\n[[File:Malay Keris.jpg|thumb|A Malay Keris, with its sheath on the left. This particular dagger was historically belonged to a Malay aristocrat from [[Sumatra]].]]\n{{See also|Taming Sari}}\nThe [[Keris]] is one of the most revered items of Malay weaponry. Originally developed by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] down south, the armament gradually assumed a Malay identity after entering the [[Srivijaya]]n court, giving rise to characteristics distinct from its Javanese Keris forebears.<ref name=\"William Wira Kusuma 2011\">{{harvnb| William Wira Kusuma|2011}}</ref> By the time of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] in the 15th century, the evolution of the Malay Keris was perfected and possession of a Keris came to be regarded as part-and-parcel of Malay culture, becoming a philosophical symbol, juxtapositioned in prestige, craftsmanship, masculinity and honour.<ref name=\"Syefiri Moniz Mohd. Niza 2016\">{{harvnb|Syefiri Moniz Mohd.

The absence of a Keris on a man was frowned upon, perceived as if he were parading naked to the public. Traditionally, a man of Malay extraction would own three types of Keris: ''Keris Pusaka'' (the Dynasty Keris, inherited from one generation to another), ''Keris Pangkat'' (the Status Keris, awarded in right of his position in Malay society) and ''Keris Perjuangan Dirinya'' (the Struggle Keris, literally defined as his personal Keris). There are many strict rules, regulations and taboos to be adhered to in owning a Keris.<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/> The blade of a Kris is usually coated in a venomous arsenic, thus crafting an excruciatingly lethal blade for its prey.<ref name=\"Faizal Izzani Zakaria 2016\"/> Traditionally, each Keris is also regarded as possessing a [[spirit]], known as ''semangat''. Special rituals were to be conducted to nurture, preserve and guard the \"soul\" of the weapon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thepatriots.asia/archives/4275 |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923024340/https://www.thepatriots.asia/archives/4275 |archive-date=23 September 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The spiritual approach is usually held every ''Malam Jumaat'' (Thursday night), with the blade is being purified with [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] and smoked with [[incense]], dedicated prayers and devoted mantras would be also recited upon to complement the mystic ritual.<ref name=\"Irma Musliana 2016\">{{harvnb|Irma Musliana|2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Istinggar Melayu.jpg|thumb|The [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger mechanism]] of an ''[[Istinggar]]'', a classical Malay gun as displayed in ''Muzium Warisan Melayu'' (Malay Heritage Museum), [[Seri Kembangan|Serdang]], [[Selangor]]. It was the result of Indo-European gun making and Malay gun making. Before the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|fall of Malacca]] (1511), already existed malay firearm called ''bedil'', or [[Java arquebus]].]]\nThe Malays and Javanese are abided by contrasting philosophical [[values]] pertaining to Keris-wearing. Traditionally, a Malay would embedded his Keris from the front, an honour that the weapon is more paramount compared to the wearer and a constant reminder that one is always equipped to combat the nemesis. The Javanese however, adhered to the principle that he should be more cautious and the Keris may solely be exercised during the time of need, thus cladding their Keris from behind. The Javanese also believed that by mobilising their weapon that position, it would confused the enemy.<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/>\n\nParadoxically, both groups shared a similar ideology addressing the [[Kris#Hilt|hilt]] of the Keris. If the hilt faced up front, it serves as a testament that the man is prepared for a fight. Nevertheless, if the hilt is turned behind, it is an oath that the person is embracing for a [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]].<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/>\n\nThere are also a plethora of other forms of weaponry in the Malay arsenal, all were nevertheless equally revered in a correlating manner as the Keris. The Malays would classified the traditional weapons under 7 different structures: ''Tuju'' (\"Direct\", the large and heavy artillery, including the Malay [[cannons]] of ''Meriam'', ''Ekor Lontong'', ''Lela'' and ''Rentaka''), ''Bidik'' (\"[[Gun]]\", a weapon with metal tube propelled by an [[ammunition]], with the Malay forms of ''Terakor'' and ''Istingar''), ''Setubuh'' (\"A body\", weapon in the similar dimension of a [[human body]], referred to the Malay [[spears]] of ''Tongkat Panjang'' and ''Lembing''), ''Selengan'' (\"An arm\", a large [[saber]] from the length of the shoulders to the tips of the fingers, constituting the Malay saber of ''Pedang'' and ''Sundang''), ''Setangan'' (\"A hand\", a sword with the diameter measured from the elbow to the 3 fingers, including ''Badik Panjang'' and ''Tekpi''), ''Sepegang'' (\"A hold\", smaller than the ''Setangan'', a [[dagger]] with ''Keris'' and ''Badik'' in the category) and ''Segenggam'' (\"A grab\", the smallest in the category, the hand-sized [[blade]], including ''Lawi Ayam'', ''Kerambit'', ''Kuku Macan'' and ''Kapak Binjai'').<ref name=\"Kerawang Merah 2017\">{{harvnb|Kerawang Merah|2017}}</ref> Other items in the traditional Malay weaponry includes ''sumpit'' ([[Blowgun|Blowpipe]]) and ''Busur dan Panah'' ([[Bow and Arrow]]), which are distinct from the seven class of armaments. Additionally, the Malays also would deploy ''Zirah'', a type of ''Baju Besi'' ([[armour]]) and ''Perisai'' ([[shield]]) as defense mechanisms during the [[armed conflict]].\n\n===Traditional games===\n[[File:Finished wau and wau frame.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Wau bulan|Wau]]-maker's workshop in [[Kelantan]], Malaysia. This peculiar type of kite can be found in the northeast coast of Malay Peninsular.]]\nTraditional Malay games usually require craft skills and manual dexterity and can be traced their origins since the days of Malacca Sultanate. ''[[Sepak Raga]]'' and [[kite flying]] are among traditional games that were mentioned in the [[Malay Annals]] being played by nobilities and royalties of the Malay sultanate.<ref>{{harvnb|Leyden|1821|p=261}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lockard|2009|p=48}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ooi|2004|p=1357}}</ref>\n\n''[[Sepak Raga]]'' is one of the most popular Malay games and has been played for centuries. Traditionally, Sepak raga was played in circle by kicking and keeps aloft the rattan ball using any part of the body except the arms and hands. It is now recognised as [[Malaysia]]'s national sport<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|1972|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McNair|2002|p=104}}</ref> and played in the international sporting events such as [[Asian Games]] and [[Southeast Asian Games]].\n\n[[File:Gasing.jpg|thumb|A close-up to two Malay style ''[[Top|Gasings]]''.]]\nOther popular game is [[top|''Gasing'' spinning]] which usually played after the [[harvest]] season. A great skill of [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] is required to produce the most competitive ''Gasing'' (top), some of which spin for two hours at a time.<ref name=\"Alexander 2006 51\">{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=51}}</ref>\n\nPossibly the most popular Malay games is the ''[[Wau bulan|Wau]]'' (a unique kind of kite from east coast of Malay peninsular) or kite flying. Wau-flying competitions take place with judges awarding points for craftsmanship (''Wau'' are beautiful, colourful objects set on bamboo frames), sound (all [[Malay kite]]s are designed to create a specific sound as they are buffeted about in the wind) and altitude.<ref name=\"Alexander 2006 51\"/>\n\nThe Malays also have a variant of [[Mancala]] board game known as [[Congkak]]. The game is played by moving stones, marbles, beads or shells around a wooden board consisting of twelve or more holes. Mancala is acknowledged as the oldest game in the world and can be traced its origin since [[Ancient Egypt]].\nAs the game dispersed around the globe, every culture has invented its own variation including the Malays.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=52}}</ref>\n\n===Names and titles===\n{{Main|Malay names|Malay styles and titles}}\nMalay personal names are complex, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the society, and titles are considered important. It has undergone tremendous change, evolving with the times to reflect the different influences that the Malays been subjected over the ages. Although some Malay names still retain parts of its indigenous [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] influences, as Muslims, Malays have long favoured [[Arabic names]] as marks of their religion.\n\nMalay names are [[patronymic]] and can be consisted of up to four parts; a title, a given name, the family name, and a description of the individual's male parentage. Some given names and father's names can be composed of double names and even triple names, therefore generating a longer name. For example, one of the Malaysian national footballer has the full name [[Mohd Zaquan Adha Abdul Radzak]], where 'Mohd Zaquan Adha' is his triple given name and 'Abdul Radzak' is his father's double given name.\n\nIn addition to naming system, the [[Malay language]] also has an elaborate system of [[titles]] and [[honorifics]], which are still extensively used in [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. By applying these [[Malay titles]] to a normal Malay name, a more complex name is produced. The former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] has the full name [[Najib Tun Razak|Dato' Seri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak]], where 'Dato' Seri' is a Malay title of honour, 'Mohd Najib' is his personal name, 'bin' is derived from an Arabic word Ibnu meaning \"son of\" if in case of daughter it is replaced with binti, an Arabic word \"bintun\" meaning \"daughter of\", introduces his father's titles and names, 'Tun' is a higher honour, 'Haji' denotes his father's [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], and 'Abdul Razak' is his father's personal name.\nThe more extremely complex Malay names however, belong to the Malay royalties. The reigning [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] has the full regnal name [[Abdullah of Pahang|Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta'in Billah]], while the reigning [[Sultan of Brunei]] officially known as [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar 'Ali Saifuddien Sa'adul Khairi Waddien]].\n\n==Sub-ethnic groups==\n[[File:Indonesia Ethnic Groups Map English.svg|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Ethnic Malays among other ethnic groups in Indonesia.

[[Malay Peninsula]], eastern [[Sumatra]] of Indonesia and coastal [[Borneo]], as well as the smaller islands which lie between these locations \u2014 areas that are collectively known as the [[Malay world]]. These locations are today part of the nations of [[Malaysia]] (Malay [[nation state]]), [[Brunei]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]] and Southern [[Thailand]].\n\nThere is considerable genetic, linguistic, cultural, artistic, and social diversity among the many Malay subgroups, mainly due to hundreds of years of immigration and assimilation of various regional ethnicity and tribes within [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Historically, the Malay population is descended primarily from the earlier [[Malayic languages|Malayic]]-speaking Austronesians and [[Austroasiatic]] tribes who founded several ancient maritime trading states and kingdoms, notably [[History of Brunei|Brunei]], [[Kedah Kingdom|Kedah]], [[Langkasuka]], [[Gangga Negara]], [[Chi Tu]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Old Pahang Kingdom|Pahang]], [[Melayu Kingdom|Melayu]] and [[Srivijaya]].<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=24, 33}}</ref><ref name=\"Barnard 2004 7\">{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=7&60}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] in the 15th century triggered a major revolution in Malay history, the significance of which lies in its far-reaching political and cultural legacy. Common definitive markers of a [[Malayness]] \u2013 the religion of [[Islam]], the [[Malay language]] and traditions \u2013 are thought to have been promulgated during this era, resulting in the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Malay as a major  [[ethnoreligious group]] in the region.{{sfn|Melayu Online|2005}} In literature, architecture, [[Malay cuisine|culinary traditions]], traditional dress, performing arts, martial arts, and royal court traditions, Malacca set a standard that later Malay sultanates emulated. The golden age of the [[Malay sultanate]]s in the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]] saw many of their inhabitants, particularly from various tribal communities like the [[Batak]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], [[Orang Asli]] and the [[Orang Laut]] become subject to [[Islamisation]] and [[Malayisation]].{{sfn|Milner|2010|pp=200, 232}}  Today, some Malays have recent forebears from other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, termed as ''anak dagang'' (\"traders\") and who predominantly consist of [[Banjar people|Banjar]], [[Bugis]],  [[Minangkabau people]] and [[Acehnese people]]s, while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other countries.{{sfn|Milner|2010|p=10 & 185}}\n\nThroughout their history, the Malays have been known as a coastal-trading community with fluid cultural characteristics.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=131}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|pp=7, 32, 33 & 43}}</ref> They [[Trans-cultural diffusion|absorbed]], [[Intercultural communication principles|shared]] and [[Cultural learning|transmitted]] numerous cultural features of other local ethnic groups, such as those of Minang, Acehnese, and to some degree [[Javanese culture]]; however Malay culture differs by being more overtly Islamic than the multi-religious Javanese culture. Ethnic Malays are also the major source of the ethnocultural development of the related [[Betawi people|Betawi]], [[Banjar people|Banjar]], [[Cape Malay]], [[Cocos Malays]] and [[Sri Lankan Malays|Sri Lankan Malay]] cultures, as well as the development of Malay trade and creole languages like [[Ambonese Malay]], [[Baba Malay]], the [[Betawi language]] and [[Manado Malay]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:JogetUNISEL.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Joget]] dance from the [[Malacca Sultanate]]; many aspects of Malay culture are derived from the Malaccan court.]]\nThe epic literature, the ''[[Malay Annals]]'', associates the etymological origin of \"Melayu\" to ''Sungai Melayu'' ('Melayu river') in [[Sumatra]], Indonesia. The term is thought to be derived from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''melaju'', a combination of the verbal [[prefix]] 'me' and the [[root word]] 'laju', meaning \"to accelerate\", used to describe the accelerating strong current of the river.<ref>{{harvnb|Abdul Rashid Melebek|Amat Juhari Moain|2006|pp=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nThe word \"Melayu\" as an [[ethnonym]], to allude to a clearly different ethnological cluster, is assumed to have been made fashionable throughout the integration of the Malacca Sultanate as a regional power in the 15th century. It was applied to report the social partialities of the Malaccans as opposed to foreigners as of the similar area, especially the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Thai people|Thais]]{{sfn|Barnard|2004|p=4}} This is evidenced from the early 16th century Malay word-list by [[Antonio Pigafetta]] who joined the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan's circumnavigation]], that made a reference to how the phrase ''chiara Malaiu'' ('Malay ways') was used in the [[maritime Southeast Asia]], to refer to the ''al parlare de Malaea'' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for \"to speak of Malacca\").<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=22}}</ref>\n\nThe English term \"Malay\" was adopted via the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word Malayo, itself derived from {{lang-pt|Malaio}}, which originates from the original Malay word, Melayu.\n[[File:Candi Tinggi.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds]] in [[Jambi]], historically linked to the pre-Islamic [[Melayu Kingdom]].]]\nPrior to the 15th century, the term \"Melayu\" and its similar-sounding variants appear to apply as an old [[toponym]] to the [[Strait of Malacca]] region in general.<ref>{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=3}}</ref>\n[[File:Tengku Abd Aziz Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah.jpg|thumb|Tengku Abd Aziz, the Prince of [[Terengganu]] in a classical formal Malay attire.

The ancient folk religion vividly characterised that every elements of nature possessed a spirit, known as ''semangat''.

Rebellions against the Javanese rule ensued and attempts were made by the fleeing Malay princes to revive the empire, which left the area of southern Sumatra in chaos and desolation.

Between the 13th to early 14th century, the kingdom succeeded to incorporate most of the Malay Peninsula under its mandala. The campaign led by [[Chandrabhanu Sridhamaraja]] (1230\u20131263) managed to capture [[Jaffna kingdom]] in [[Sri Lanka]] between 1247 and 1258.

Brunei also expanded its influence in Mindanao, [[Philippines]] when Sultan Bolkiah married Leila Macanai, the daughter of the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]]. However, states like the [[Huangdom of Pangasinan]], [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] and [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]] tried to resist Brunei's and Islam's spread into the Philippines. Brunei's fairly loose river based governmental presence in Borneo projected the process of [[Malayisation]]. Fine Malay Muslim cultures, including the language, dress and single-family dwelling were introduced to the natives primarily from ethnic [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], drawing them into the Sultanate. Dayak chiefs were incorporated into the Malay hierarchy, being given the official titles of ''[[Datuk]]'', ''[[Temenggong]]'' and ''Orang Kaya''.

The sultanate would be abolished almost half a century later in 1911 by the Dutch powers, following a strong independence movement manifested in the nation against the [[Dutch East Indies|colonial government]].]]\n\nBetween 1511 and 1984, numerous Malay kingdoms and sultanates fell under direct [[colonisation]] or became the [[protectorate]]s of different foreign powers, from European colonial powers like [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom|British]], to regional powers like [[Siam]] and [[Japan]].\nIn 1511, the [[Portuguese Empire]] [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|captured]] the capital city of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. The victorious Portuguese however, were unable to extend their political influence beyond the [[A Famosa|fort of Malacca]]. The Sultan maintained his overlordship on the lands outside Malacca and established the [[Johor Sultanate]] in 1528 to succeed Malacca. [[Portuguese Malacca]] faced several unsuccessful retaliation attacks by Johor until 1614, when the combined forces of Johor and the [[Dutch Empire]], [[Battle of Malacca (1641)|ousted]] the Portuguese from the peninsula. As per agreement with Johor in 1606, the Dutch later took control of Malacca.<ref>{{harvnb|Hunter|Roberts|2010|p=345}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, [[Malay states]] of the peninsular had a hostile relation with the [[Thai people|Siamese]]. Malacca sultanate herself fought two wars with the Siamese while northern Malay states came intermittently under Siamese dominance for centuries. In 1771, the [[Thonburi Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] under the new [[Chakri Dynasty]] abolished the [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani Sultanate]] and later annexed a large part of [[Kedah Sultanate]]. Earlier, the Siamese under [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] have had already absorbed [[Tambralinga]] and overrun the [[Singgora Sultanate]] in the 17th century. Between 1808\u20131813, the Siamese imposed a new administrative structure and created the [[Satellite state|semi-independent]] Malay kingdoms of [[Pattani Kingdom|Patani]], [[Sai Buri District|Saiburi]], [[Nong Chik District|Nongchik]], [[Yaring District|Yaring]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Reman]] and [[Rangae]] from [[Patani (region)|Greater Pattani]] and similarly obtained [[Ranong province|Rundung]], [[Takua Pa District|Kupa]], [[Phuket province|Tongkah]], [[Trang Province|Terang]] while carving [[Setul Kingdom|Setul]], Langu, [[Perlis]], [[Kubang Pasu Kingdom|Kubang Pasu]] from the [[Kedah Kingdom]] in 1839.<ref>{{harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|pp=62\u201368}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ganguly|1997|p=204}}</ref> In 1902, the Siamese stripped the political powers of all the 7 kingdoms of Pattani following a planned revolt for independence against the central government.

In 1819, the company also acquired [[Singapore]] from [[Johor Empire]], later in 1824, [[Dutch Malacca]] from the Dutch, and followed by [[Straits Settlements#Dindings and Province Wellesley|Dindings]] from [[Perak]] by 1874. All these trading posts officially known as [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 and became the crown colony of [[British Empire]] in 1867. British intervention in the affairs of Malay states was formalised in 1895, when [[Malay rulers]] accepted [[British Resident]]s in administration, and the [[Federated Malay States]] was formed. In 1909, [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] were [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|handed over]] by Siam to the British. These states along with [[Johor]], later became known as [[Unfederated Malay States]]. During the [[World War II]], all these British possessions and protectorates that collectively known as [[British Malaya]] were occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\nThe twilight of the vast Bruneian Empire began during the [[Castille War]] against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] conquistadors which arrived at the Philippines from Mexico. The war resulted in the end of the empire's dominance in the present-day [[Philippine archipelago]]. The decline further culminated in the 19th century, when the Sultanate lost most of its remaining territories in [[Borneo]] to the [[White Rajah]]s of [[Sarawak]], [[North Borneo Chartered Company]] and its [[Kalimantan|lower Borneo]] vassals to [[Dutch East India Company]]. Brunei was a British protectorate from 1888 to 1984.<ref name=\"CIA (B)\">{{harvnb|CIA World Factbook|t=Brunei|2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] which divided the [[Malay Archipelago]] into a British zone in the north and a Dutch zone in the south, all Malay sultanates in [[Sumatra]] and [[Kalimantan|Southern Borneo]] became part of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Though some of Malay sultans maintain their power under Dutch control,<ref>{{harvnb|Lumholtz|2004|p=17}}</ref> some were abolished by the Dutch government under the accusation of retaliation against the colonial rule, like the case of Palembang Sultanate in 1823, Jambi Sultanate in 1906 and [[Riau Sultanate]] in 1911.\n\n[[File:Sultans at the first Malayan Durbar.jpg|thumb|The [[Malay Rulers]] and nobilities of Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak and Selangor with [[British Malaya|British colonial officers]] during the first [[Conference of Rulers|Durbar]] in Istana Negara, [[Kuala Kangsar]], [[Perak]], [[Federated Malay States]], 1897.]]\nA similar partition of the [[Malay Peninsular|Peninsular]] was also replicated by the British and the Siamese in wake of the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]]. This was done after the British alarmed by the growing influence between Siamese government and rivaling [[German colonial empire]], especially in the northern Peninsular. The Anglo-Siamese Treaty attested that the Siamese to control the [[Southern Thailand|upper portion]] of the peninsular while the lower region was to be held under the [[British Empire|British dominance]]. The British originally planned for the inclusion of [[Kingdom of Reman|Reman]], Legeh and [[Kingdom of Setul|Setul]] under their dominion together with a cluster of northern Malay states. Nonetheless, they only managed to secure [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] under the agreement. The treaty also witnessed the state of Kedah being reduced the most, with [[Tarutao National Park|Tarutao]], [[Tarutao National Park|Butang islands]] groups, [[Sadao District|Sendawa]], [[La-ngu District|Langgu]] and the principality of [[Setul Kingdom|Setul]] were all being divorced into the Siamese hands, a similar fate was also followed in northeastern coast of Kelantan that was demanded to renounced their right on the [[Tak Bai District|Tabal district]], including [[Su-ngai Kolok District|Sungai Golok]] and [[Su-ngai Padi District|Sungai Padi]]; while [[Perlis]] lost its Pujoh district. Then-British controlled [[Federated Malay States|Federated Malay State]] of [[Perak]] however, saw an enlargement of their land area, with [[Hulu Perak|southern territories]] of [[Reman]] being transferred into the state and additionally Kelantan received [[Jeli District|Jeli]] from Legeh (which had been under Siamese jurisdiction since 1902). The Siamese then [[abdicated]] Tunku Baharuddin, the [[Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara|King of Setul]], the sole Malay kingdom remained under Siamese territory in 1916. The treaty nonetheless, manage to sealed the fate of the Malay states of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] to retain a degree of their sovereign powers under the [[British Malaya|British colonial government]], a legacy that can be witnessed today in the Malaysian administrative system.\n\nLater during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]], [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|British Malaya]] and [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Borneo]], the Japanese maintained a favourable relationship with the Sultans and other Malay leaders, this is partially composed to foster the trust of the Malay public that was generally loyal towards the sultan. Nonetheless, in a series of massacres known as [[Pontianak incidents]], the Japanese assassinated virtually all of the [[West Kalimantan]] Malay sultans, including a large numbers of Malay intelligentsias after they have been falsely accused of planning an uprising and [[coup d'etat]] against the Japanese.

In the [[Netherlands Indies]], the struggle against colonisation was characterised by the trans-ethnic nationalism: the so-called \"[[Indonesian National Awakening]]\" united people from the various parts of the Dutch colony in the development of a national consciousness as \"Indonesians\".<ref name=\"Ricklefs, pp. 163-164\">Ricklefs, pp. 163\u2013164.</ref> In Brunei, despite some attempt made to arouse Malay political consciousness between 1942 and 1945, there was no significant history of ethnic-based nationalism. In Thailand however, [[South Thailand insurgency|Pattani separatism]] against Thai rule is regarded by some historians as a part of the wider sphere of peninsula Malay nationalism. A similar [[secession movement]] can be witnessed in modern-day Indonesia, where both autochthonously-Malay provinces of [[Riau]] and [[Riau Islands]] sought to gain independence under the name of Republic of Riau. Nevertheless, what follows is specific to the peninsula Malay nationalism that resulted in the formation of the [[Federation of Malaya]], later reconstituted as Malaysia.\n\nThe earliest and most influential instruments of Malay national awakening were the [[periodical]]s which politicised the position of the Malays in the face of colonialism and alien immigration of non-Malays. In spite of repressions imposed by the British colonial government, there were no less than 147 journals and newspapers published in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] between 1876 and 1941. Among notable periodicals were ''Al-Imam'' (1906), ''Pengasuh'' (1920), ''Majlis'' (1935) and ''[[Utusan Melayu]]'' (1939). The rise of [[Malay nationalism]] was largely mobilised by three nationalist factions \u2013 the radicals distinguishable into the Malay left and the Islamic group which were both opposed to the conservative elites.<ref name=\"Leo Suryadinata\">{{harvnb|Suryadinata|2000|pp=133\u2013136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Malaya stamp.png|thumb|left|Federation of Malaya's commemorative stamp issued in 1957. The semi-independent federation was formed in 1948 from nine [[Malay states]] and two British [[Straits Settlements]]. It [[Hari Merdeka|achieved independence]] in 1957.]]\nThe Malay [[leftist]]s were represented by [[Kesatuan Melayu Muda]], formed in 1938 by a group of Malay intelligentsia primarily educated in [[Sultan Idris Training College]], with an ideal of ''[[Greater Indonesia]]''. In 1945, they reorganised themselves into a political party known as Partai Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (PKMM). The [[Islamist]]s were originally represented by ''Kaum Muda'' consisted of Middle east \u2013educated scholars with [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] sentiment. The first Islamic political party was ''Partai Orang Muslimin Malaya'' (Hizbul Muslimin) formed in March 1948, later succeeded by [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|Pan-Malayan Islamic Party]] in 1951. The third group was [[Conservatism|the conservatives]] consisted of the westernised elites who were bureaucrats and members of royal families that shared a common English education mostly at the exclusive [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]]. They formed voluntary organisations known as ''Persatuan Melayu'' ('Malay Associations') in various parts of the country with the primary goals of advancing and protecting the interests of Malays. In March 1946, 41 of these Malay associations formed [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), to assert [[Malay dominance]] over Malaya.<ref name=\"Leo Suryadinata\"/>\n\nThe Malay and [[Malayness]] has been the fundamental basis for Malay ideology and Malay nationalism in Malaysia. All three Malay nationalist factions believed in the idea of a ''Bangsa Melayu'' ('Malay Nation') and the position of Malay language, but disagreed over the role of Islam and Malay rulers. The conservatives supported [[Malay language]], [[Malay Islamic identity|Islam]] and [[Malay rulers|Malay monarchy]] as constituting the key pillars of Malayness, but within a secular state that restricted the political role of Islam. The leftists concurred with the [[secular state]] but wanted to end [[feudalism]], whereas the Islamic group favoured ending royalty but sought a much larger role of [[Islam]].<ref>{{harvnb|Barrington|2006|pp=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Spandoeken tijdens het bezoek van de Wali Negara Sumatera Timur aan Pematangsiantar TMnr 60024766.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Supporters of ''Negara Soematra Timoer'' ([[State of East Sumatra]]) that sought to maintain the monarchy system in [[Aftermath of World War II#Dutch East Indies|post-World War II]] Dutch-established territory of East Sumatra.

The new movement forged a close political link between rulers and subjects never before achieved. It generated an excited Malay public opinion which, together with the surprising political apathy of the non-Malays, led to Britain's abandonment of the radical [[Malayan Union]] plan. By July, UMNO succeeded in obtaining an agreement with the British to begin negotiations for a new constitution. Negotiations continued from August to November, between British officials on the one hand, and the Sultans' representatives and UMNO and the other.<ref name=\"Riwanto Tirtosudarmo\">{{harvnb|Tirtosudarmo|2005}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later the semi independent [[Federation of Malaya]] was born. The new constitutional arrangement largely reverted to the basic pattern of pre-war colonial rule and built on the supremacy of the individual Malay states. Malay rights and privileges were safeguarded. The traditional [[Malay rulers]] thus retained their prerogatives, while their English-educated descendants came to occupy positions of authority at the centre, which was being progressively decolonised. In August 1957, the [[Federation of Malaya]], the West's last major dependency in Southeast Asia, attained independence in a peaceful transfer of power.<ref name=\"Riwanto Tirtosudarmo\"/> The federation was reconstituted as [[Malaysia]] with the addition in 1963 of [[Singapore]] (separated in 1965), [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]].\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Language===\n[[File:Prasasti Kedukan Bukit 3.jpg|thumb|The [[Kedukan Bukit Inscription]] written in [[Vatteluttu|Pallava script]].

Among the forms of poetry in Malay literature are \u2013 the [[Pantun]], [[Syair]] and [[Gurindam]].\n\nThe earliest form of Malay literature was the [[oral literature]] and its central subjects are traditional [[folklore]] relating to [[nature]], animals and people. The classical Malay folklore is composed of traditional songs and music, heroic poems, animal fables, ghost stories, past events, fairy tales, symbolic lore, myths and bardic tales. Each of the stories possessed its own energy in terms of character, spirit, backdrop and storytelling and was largely crafted with the intend of happiness, guidance, educating, reminiscing, explaining, among few. The folklore were memorised and passed from one generation of storytellers to the next. Many of these tales were also written down by ''penglipur lara'' (storytellers) for example: ''[[Hikayat Malim Dewa]]'', ''Hikayat Malim Deman'', ''Hikayat Raja Donan'', ''Hikayat Anggun Cik Tunggal'', and ''[[Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda]]''.\n\nWhen Indian influences made their way to the Malay Archipelago around 2000 years ago, Malay literature began incorporating Indian elements. Literature of this time is mostly translations of [[Sanskrit literature]] and romances, or at least some productions inspired by such, and is full of allusions to [[Hindu mythology]]. Probably to this early time may be traced such works as ''[[Hikayat Seri Rama]]'' (a free translation of the ''[[Ramayana]]''), ''[[Hikayat Bayan Budiman]]'' (an adaptation of [[\u015aukasaptati]]) and ''[[Hikayat Panca Tanderan]]'' (an adaptation of ''[[Hitopadesha]]'').<ref name=\"popular science 1899\">{{harvnb|Ford|1899|pp=379\u2013381}}</ref>\n\nThe era of classical Malay literature started after the arrival of Islam and the invention of [[Jawi script]] (Arabic based Malay script). Since then, Islamic beliefs and concepts began to make its mark on Malay literature. The [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]], which is dated to 1303, is the earliest known narrative Malay writing. The stone is inscribed with an account of history, law, and [[romance (love)|romance]] in Jawi script.<ref name=\"Marshall Cavendish 2007 1218\">{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1218}}</ref> At its height, the Malacca Sultanate was not only the center of Islamisation, but also the center of Malay cultural expressions including literature.

The natural tropical settings where flora and fauna and cosmic forces is abundant has inspired the motives to be depict in abstract or styled form into the timber board. With the coming of Islam, geometric and [[Islamic calligraphy]] form were introduced in the wood carving. The woods used are typically from tropical hardwood species which is known to be durable and can resist the attacks of the fungi, power-boots beetles and termites.<ref>{{harvnb|Ismail Said|2002}}</ref>\n\nA typical Malay traditional houses or mosque would have been adorned with more than 20 carved components. The carving on the walls and the panels allow the air breeze to circulate effectively in and out of the building and can let the sunlight to light the interior of the structure. At the same time, the shadow cast by the panels would also create a shadow based on the motives adding the beauty on the floor.

Due to the vastness of various Malay kingdoms in the [[Malay archipelago|archipelago]], local and distinct forms of the Baju Kurung design patterns can also be witnessed in the region, including Bengkulu, Kedah, Jambi, Johor-Riau, Pahang and Palembang.<ref name=\"Hanisa Hassan 2016 1\"/>\n\nThe corresponding mode of Baju Kurung for men is known as \"Baju Melayu\". The upper part of the garment was made with the geometrical design almost similar with Baju Kurung and commonly paired with woven cloth known as the sarong. The pattern of the sarong may possessed a symbol of the person's marital status or the rank in the classical Malay society.<ref name=\"Hanisa Hassan 2016 1\"/>\n\nOther common classical Malay attire for men consists of a ''baju'' (shirt) or ''tekua'' (a type of a long sleeve shirt), ''baju rompi'' (vest), ''kancing'' (button), a small leg ''celana'' (trousers), a [[sarong]] worn around the waist, ''capal'' (sandal), and a ''tanjak'' or ''tengkolok'' ([[headgear]]); for the aristocrats, the ''baju sikap'' or ''baju layang'' (a type of coat) and ''pending'' (ornamental belt buckle) are also synonymous to be worn as a formal attire. It was also common for a ''pendekar'' (Malay warrior) to have a [[Kris]] tucked into the front fold of sarong.\n\nIn contrast to Baju Melayu which continued to be worn as ceremonial dress only, Baju Kurung is worn daily throughout the year by a majority of Malay women. Sighting of female civil servants, professional workers and students wearing Baju Kurung is common in Malaysia and Brunei.\n\n===Festivals and celebrations===\n[[File:Majlis Tujuh Likor Pasang Pelita.jpg|thumb|Rows of Pelita ([[oil lamps]]) lighted during ''Malam Tujuh Likur'' (the 27th night of [[Ramadhan]]), the oil lamps are traditionally used to illuminate homes and the streets during the Ramadhan. Seen here in [[Muar town|Muar]], Johor, Malaysia]]\nThe rise of [[Islam]] managed to [[ethnogenesis|redefine]] the [[Malayness|Malay identity]] by the 15th century. Thus, resulting most of the Malay festivals and celebrations to run parallel with the [[Islamic calendar]], albeit deeply ingrained with a strong sense of [[Malayisation|Malay character]]. The biannual [[Hari Raya]] (lit \"the Great Day\") observance of [[Aildifitri]] and [[Aidiladha]] are hailed as the grand celebrations universally across the Malay community. The two holidays are instrumental to commentate two major events and philosophy in the Islamic teaching and beliefs. The former signifies the triumph as a Muslim after a month of [[Fasting in Islam|fasting]] and patience in [[Ramadan]], while the latter is to observe the sacrifice made by [[Ibrahim]] (Abraham) under the name of [[Allah]].\n\nThe ''Raya'' holidays usually commenced during the [[wikt:homecoming|homecoming]] event known as [[Balik Kampung]] or ''Balik Raya'' which occurred a few days before the festival. During the Hari Raya, the Malays would celebrated by performing the [[Eid prayers]], holding a grand feast and visiting friends, relatives and neighbours. A visit to the grave of the departed loved ones is also essential, as a sign of respect, love and honour.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Plechtigheden bij de kroning van de Sultan van Deli in 1925 op de troon de sultan en zijn echtgenote met aan weerszijden de rijkssieraden TMnr 10001572.jpg|thumb|The coronation ceremony between Tengku Otteman, as the ''Tengku Mahkota'' (Crown Prince) of [[Sultanate of Deli|Deli Sultanate]] in Residency of Sumatra's East Coast, [[Dutch East Indies]]; with his wife, Raja Amnah, daughter of [[Raja Chulan]] and a member of [[Perak Sultanate|Perak Royalty]] as ''Tengku Puan Indera'' in 1925.]]\nOther major liturgical and religious ceremonies celebrated by the Malays include [[Ramadhan]], a month-long holy month devoted by daytime fasting and various religious activities; [[Maulidur Rasul]], a special grand procession to honour the birth of Prophet [[Muhammad]]; [[Ashura]], remembrance of [[Muharram]] where the Malays would solemnly prepared a special dish, known as ''Bubur Ashura''; [[Nisfu Syaaban]], the Mid-[[Sha'ban]] observance, a special day of [[fasting]] for forgiveness; [[Nuzul Quran]], the first the revelation of the [[Quran]]; [[Israk dan Mikraj]], the ascension Prophet Muhammed to the heavens and [[Awal Muharram]], the Islamic New Year; the latter three celebrations are usually observed by holding a special ''sunat'' prayers, religious lectures and Islamic discussions in the [[mosque]].\n\nThere are also a plethora of domestic regional cultural festivals and social events within different the Malay spheres. The coastal areas were historically known to observed the ''Mandi Safar'' or ''Puja Pantai'' ceremony, a purifying bath during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Safar]], originally emulated from the ancient pre-Islamic Malay holy cleansing rituals; and ''Pesta Menuai'', a [[harvest festival]] celebrated by the inland and agrarian Malay communities by traditional games, theatre, [[Joget]] and other repertoire of dance-play. However, both of the practice is gradually extinct owing from various social and economic revolution engineered in the Malay community in the 20th century. Additionally, many Malays are also known to participate in the imperial celebrations to honour the royal courts of their respective kingdoms.\n\nThe Islamic features also strongly embroidered the Malay celebrations in the individual level, a juxtaposition bonded to the spiritual [[rite of passage]] as a Muslim. The Malays would usually organised ''kenduri'', a religious ceremonial banquet to celebrate or to seek blessing for an event. There are several philosophical variations of kenduri, raging from ''Doa Selamat'' (asking for divine favour and protection), ''Kesyukuran'' (for thanksgiving and gratitude), ''Melenggang Perut'' (ceremonial massage for a mother who is pregnant with her first child), ''Aqiqah'' and ''Cukur Jambul'' (newborn ceremony, for celebrating a new life), ''Bertindik'' (the first piercing ceremony for a female child), ''Khatam'' (a graduation ceremony, after a child's first full-reading of the [[Quran]]), ''Khatan'' ([[circumcision]]),  ''Kahwin'' ([[wedding]]), ''Arwah'' or ''Tahlil'' (prayers for a deceased person),  among few. The event is usually organised by the family and was traditionally aided by the community in a social gathering known as ''Rewang'' or ''Gotong-royong''. During this ceremony, the whole family would be assisted by their neighbours and relatives, delegating various tasks raging from food preparations, venue management, logistic assembly and other technical control. Nevertheless, following the rise of [[urbanism]] in the contemporary Malay community, the practice of ''Rewang/Gotong-Royong'' is gradually superseded by hired-[[catering|caterer]] services by the family.\n\n===Martial arts===\n[[File:Silat Melayu Keris Lok 9.jpg|thumb|A [[Silat Melayu]] performance on a stage.]]\n{{Main|Silat|Silat Melayu}}\nSilat and its variants can be found throughout the Malay world: the [[Malay peninsula]] (including [[Singapore]]), the [[Riau Islands]], [[Sumatra]] and coastal areas of [[Borneo]]. Archaeological evidence reveals that, by the 6th century, formalised combat arts were being practised in the Malay peninsular and Sumatra.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1994|p=73}}</ref> The earliest forms of Silat are believed to have been developed and used in the armed forces of the ancient Malay kingdoms of [[Langkasuka]] (2nd century)<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=225}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Abd. Rahman Ismail|2008|p=188}}</ref> and Srivijaya (7th century).\n\nThe influence of the Malay sultanates of Malacca, [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]], [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani]] and [[Brunei Sultanate|Brunei]] has contributed to the spread of this martial art in the Malay Archipelago. Through a complex maze of sea channels and river capillaries that facilitated exchange and trade throughout the region, Silat wound its way into the dense rainforest and up into the mountains. The legendary [[Laksamana]] [[Hang Tuah]] of Malacca is one of the most renowned ''pesilat'' (Silat practitioners) in history<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2001|p=802}}</ref> and even considered by some as the father of Malay silat.<ref>{{harvnb|Sheikh Shamsuddin|2005|p=195}}</ref> Since the classical era, [[Silat Melayu]] underwent great diversification and formed what is today traditionally recognised as the source of Indonesian [[Pencak Silat]] and other forms of Silat in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{harvnb|Draeger|1992|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Farrer|2009|p=28}}</ref>\n\nApart from Silat, [[Tomoi]] is also practised by Malays, mainly in the northern region of the Malay peninsula. It is a variant of [[Indochina|Indo-Chinese]] forms of [[kickboxing]] which is believed to have been spread in the Southeast Asian mainland since the time of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan Empire]] (68&nbsp;AD).\n\n===Metal casting===\n[[File:Bunga Mas (Muzium Negara).jpg|thumb|The [[Bunga Mas]], [[National Museum of Malaysia]]. Literary translated as the \"Golden Flowers\", the Bunga Mas was offered by the northern Malay states of [[Terengganu]], [[Kelantan]], [[Kedah]], [[Patani Kingdom|Pattani]], [[Nong Chik District|Nong Chik]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Ra-ngae District|Rangae]], [[Kubang Pasu Darul Qiyam|Kubang Pasu]] and [[Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara|Setul]] to the King of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] ([[Siam]]) as a symbol of allegiance.]]\nIn the Malay society, classical [[metalworks]] assumed a role more than a mere instrumental tool. It serves as a testament of [[culture]], cultivated by [[art]]istic appreciation and [[religious]] symbol, molded by a craftsman who possessed a talent to redefined the essence of nature in the most ornamental manner. The artform has indeed received a long existence in the [[Malay World]], observations made by the [[Arab people|Arabs]] on the courts of [[Srivijaya]] narrated that about the abundance of golds in the [[Palembang|capital]], till the extend that the bars have to be ceremonially thrown into the [[estuary]] in a daily basis. On the Chinese accounts, the area was occasionally hailed as ''Jinzou'', the [[gold]] coast. The zenith of Srivijaya also witnessed the arrivals of [[silver]] bought by the foreign merchants, which then spread to the members of Malay aristocracy.<ref name=\"Shaffer 1955\">{{harvnb|Shaffer|1955}}</ref>\n\nUpon the turn of the 17th century, gold, silver, [[iron]] and [[brass]] have all been perfectly molded to become part and parcel to the Malay society. The era witnessed the works of metal received a critical royal patronage. A multitude of Malay metalworks manifested as evidence of this era, raging from a peculiar Malay dagger known as [[Keris]] made of iron, down to the elaborate fine [[jewellery]] made from the splendor of gold and silver. For the Malay nobles during this period, the works of pending (ornamental [[Belt buckle]] embellished with [[precious stones]]), ''keronsang'' (brooch) and ''cucuk sanggul'' (hairpins) were staged to become among the most sought item of fashion. The era also hosted a number of other prominent items in the Malay regalia cast in gold, including ceremonial box, ''Tepak sirih'' (Betel container) and parts of Keris. The art of casting gold were predominantly done by [[repouss\u00e9]] and [[Granulation (process)|granulation]] techniques, in which the traditional methods can still be witnessed until today. In the contemporary era, the Malay gold jewels are mainly found in the form of anklets, bracelets, rings, necklaces, pendants and earrings.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\">{{harvnb|Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass|2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Karyaneka 2013\">{{harvnb|Karyaneka|2013}}</ref>\n\nFor the Malay silverware, the works of silver are fairly known for its sophisticated and fine designs. It is usually crafted in the form of repousse, [[filigree]] and [[Niello|neillowork]]. Among the common traditional Malay items usually made of silver includes pillow ends, belt buckles, matt corners, stoppers for water vessels, Keris sheaths and tobacco boxes. The ''Awan Larat'' (cloud patterns) and ''Kerawang'' (Vegetal motives) are among the popular designs for Malay decorative silver pillow ends and tobacco boxes.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\"/>\n\nThe usage of brassware transcends a plethora of classical Malay social classes, being used by the members of nobility and commoners alike. The popularity of brassware is heavily contributed due to its durability, quality and affordability to all. The brassware can be narrowed into two distinctions, yellow brass for functional items and white for [[Ornamental brassware|decorative purposes]]. It is often meticulously hammered and craved with various decorative designs in [[Islamic arts|religious]] and floral motives. The usage of brass however, is best known for [[Tepak Sireh]], a ceremonial tray for betel quid and for constructing certain musical instruments such as [[Gong]]s for the classical Malay [[Gamelan]] orchestra. Additionally, other prominent traditional Malay items made from metal includes flower vases, perfume sprinkles, serving trays, cooking pots, kettle and incense burners.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\"/><ref name=\"Karyaneka 2013\"/>\n\n===Weaponry===\n[[File:Malay Keris.jpg|thumb|A Malay Keris, with its sheath on the left. This particular dagger was historically belonged to a Malay aristocrat from [[Sumatra]].]]\n{{See also|Taming Sari}}\nThe [[Keris]] is one of the most revered items of Malay weaponry. Originally developed by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] down south, the armament gradually assumed a Malay identity after entering the [[Srivijaya]]n court, giving rise to characteristics distinct from its Javanese Keris forebears.<ref name=\"William Wira Kusuma 2011\">{{harvnb| William Wira Kusuma|2011}}</ref> By the time of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] in the 15th century, the evolution of the Malay Keris was perfected and possession of a Keris came to be regarded as part-and-parcel of Malay culture, becoming a philosophical symbol, juxtapositioned in prestige, craftsmanship, masculinity and honour.<ref name=\"Syefiri Moniz Mohd. Niza 2016\">{{harvnb|Syefiri Moniz Mohd.

The absence of a Keris on a man was frowned upon, perceived as if he were parading naked to the public. Traditionally, a man of Malay extraction would own three types of Keris: ''Keris Pusaka'' (the Dynasty Keris, inherited from one generation to another), ''Keris Pangkat'' (the Status Keris, awarded in right of his position in Malay society) and ''Keris Perjuangan Dirinya'' (the Struggle Keris, literally defined as his personal Keris). There are many strict rules, regulations and taboos to be adhered to in owning a Keris.<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/> The blade of a Kris is usually coated in a venomous arsenic, thus crafting an excruciatingly lethal blade for its prey.<ref name=\"Faizal Izzani Zakaria 2016\"/> Traditionally, each Keris is also regarded as possessing a [[spirit]], known as ''semangat''. Special rituals were to be conducted to nurture, preserve and guard the \"soul\" of the weapon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thepatriots.asia/archives/4275 |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923024340/https://www.thepatriots.asia/archives/4275 |archive-date=23 September 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The spiritual approach is usually held every ''Malam Jumaat'' (Thursday night), with the blade is being purified with [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] and smoked with [[incense]], dedicated prayers and devoted mantras would be also recited upon to complement the mystic ritual.<ref name=\"Irma Musliana 2016\">{{harvnb|Irma Musliana|2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Istinggar Melayu.jpg|thumb|The [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger mechanism]] of an ''[[Istinggar]]'', a classical Malay gun as displayed in ''Muzium Warisan Melayu'' (Malay Heritage Museum), [[Seri Kembangan|Serdang]], [[Selangor]]. It was the result of Indo-European gun making and Malay gun making. Before the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|fall of Malacca]] (1511), already existed malay firearm called ''bedil'', or [[Java arquebus]].]]\nThe Malays and Javanese are abided by contrasting philosophical [[values]] pertaining to Keris-wearing. Traditionally, a Malay would embedded his Keris from the front, an honour that the weapon is more paramount compared to the wearer and a constant reminder that one is always equipped to combat the nemesis. The Javanese however, adhered to the principle that he should be more cautious and the Keris may solely be exercised during the time of need, thus cladding their Keris from behind. The Javanese also believed that by mobilising their weapon that position, it would confused the enemy.<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/>\n\nParadoxically, both groups shared a similar ideology addressing the [[Kris#Hilt|hilt]] of the Keris. If the hilt faced up front, it serves as a testament that the man is prepared for a fight. Nevertheless, if the hilt is turned behind, it is an oath that the person is embracing for a [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]].<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/>\n\nThere are also a plethora of other forms of weaponry in the Malay arsenal, all were nevertheless equally revered in a correlating manner as the Keris. The Malays would classified the traditional weapons under 7 different structures: ''Tuju'' (\"Direct\", the large and heavy artillery, including the Malay [[cannons]] of ''Meriam'', ''Ekor Lontong'', ''Lela'' and ''Rentaka''), ''Bidik'' (\"[[Gun]]\", a weapon with metal tube propelled by an [[ammunition]], with the Malay forms of ''Terakor'' and ''Istingar''), ''Setubuh'' (\"A body\", weapon in the similar dimension of a [[human body]], referred to the Malay [[spears]] of ''Tongkat Panjang'' and ''Lembing''), ''Selengan'' (\"An arm\", a large [[saber]] from the length of the shoulders to the tips of the fingers, constituting the Malay saber of ''Pedang'' and ''Sundang''), ''Setangan'' (\"A hand\", a sword with the diameter measured from the elbow to the 3 fingers, including ''Badik Panjang'' and ''Tekpi''), ''Sepegang'' (\"A hold\", smaller than the ''Setangan'', a [[dagger]] with ''Keris'' and ''Badik'' in the category) and ''Segenggam'' (\"A grab\", the smallest in the category, the hand-sized [[blade]], including ''Lawi Ayam'', ''Kerambit'', ''Kuku Macan'' and ''Kapak Binjai'').<ref name=\"Kerawang Merah 2017\">{{harvnb|Kerawang Merah|2017}}</ref> Other items in the traditional Malay weaponry includes ''sumpit'' ([[Blowgun|Blowpipe]]) and ''Busur dan Panah'' ([[Bow and Arrow]]), which are distinct from the seven class of armaments. Additionally, the Malays also would deploy ''Zirah'', a type of ''Baju Besi'' ([[armour]]) and ''Perisai'' ([[shield]]) as defense mechanisms during the [[armed conflict]].\n\n===Traditional games===\n[[File:Finished wau and wau frame.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Wau bulan|Wau]]-maker's workshop in [[Kelantan]], Malaysia. This peculiar type of kite can be found in the northeast coast of Malay Peninsular.]]\nTraditional Malay games usually require craft skills and manual dexterity and can be traced their origins since the days of Malacca Sultanate. ''[[Sepak Raga]]'' and [[kite flying]] are among traditional games that were mentioned in the [[Malay Annals]] being played by nobilities and royalties of the Malay sultanate.<ref>{{harvnb|Leyden|1821|p=261}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lockard|2009|p=48}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ooi|2004|p=1357}}</ref>\n\n''[[Sepak Raga]]'' is one of the most popular Malay games and has been played for centuries. Traditionally, Sepak raga was played in circle by kicking and keeps aloft the rattan ball using any part of the body except the arms and hands. It is now recognised as [[Malaysia]]'s national sport<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|1972|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McNair|2002|p=104}}</ref> and played in the international sporting events such as [[Asian Games]] and [[Southeast Asian Games]].\n\n[[File:Gasing.jpg|thumb|A close-up to two Malay style ''[[Top|Gasings]]''.]]\nOther popular game is [[top|''Gasing'' spinning]] which usually played after the [[harvest]] season. A great skill of [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] is required to produce the most competitive ''Gasing'' (top), some of which spin for two hours at a time.<ref name=\"Alexander 2006 51\">{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=51}}</ref>\n\nPossibly the most popular Malay games is the ''[[Wau bulan|Wau]]'' (a unique kind of kite from east coast of Malay peninsular) or kite flying. Wau-flying competitions take place with judges awarding points for craftsmanship (''Wau'' are beautiful, colourful objects set on bamboo frames), sound (all [[Malay kite]]s are designed to create a specific sound as they are buffeted about in the wind) and altitude.<ref name=\"Alexander 2006 51\"/>\n\nThe Malays also have a variant of [[Mancala]] board game known as [[Congkak]]. The game is played by moving stones, marbles, beads or shells around a wooden board consisting of twelve or more holes. Mancala is acknowledged as the oldest game in the world and can be traced its origin since [[Ancient Egypt]].\nAs the game dispersed around the globe, every culture has invented its own variation including the Malays.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=52}}</ref>\n\n===Names and titles===\n{{Main|Malay names|Malay styles and titles}}\nMalay personal names are complex, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the society, and titles are considered important. It has undergone tremendous change, evolving with the times to reflect the different influences that the Malays been subjected over the ages. Although some Malay names still retain parts of its indigenous [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] influences, as Muslims, Malays have long favoured [[Arabic names]] as marks of their religion.\n\nMalay names are [[patronymic]] and can be consisted of up to four parts; a title, a given name, the family name, and a description of the individual's male parentage. Some given names and father's names can be composed of double names and even triple names, therefore generating a longer name. For example, one of the Malaysian national footballer has the full name [[Mohd Zaquan Adha Abdul Radzak]], where 'Mohd Zaquan Adha' is his triple given name and 'Abdul Radzak' is his father's double given name.\n\nIn addition to naming system, the [[Malay language]] also has an elaborate system of [[titles]] and [[honorifics]], which are still extensively used in [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. By applying these [[Malay titles]] to a normal Malay name, a more complex name is produced. The former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] has the full name [[Najib Tun Razak|Dato' Seri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak]], where 'Dato' Seri' is a Malay title of honour, 'Mohd Najib' is his personal name, 'bin' is derived from an Arabic word Ibnu meaning \"son of\" if in case of daughter it is replaced with binti, an Arabic word \"bintun\" meaning \"daughter of\", introduces his father's titles and names, 'Tun' is a higher honour, 'Haji' denotes his father's [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], and 'Abdul Razak' is his father's personal name.\nThe more extremely complex Malay names however, belong to the Malay royalties. The reigning [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] has the full regnal name [[Abdullah of Pahang|Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta'in Billah]], while the reigning [[Sultan of Brunei]] officially known as [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar 'Ali Saifuddien Sa'adul Khairi Waddien]].\n\n==Sub-ethnic groups==\n[[File:Indonesia Ethnic Groups Map English.svg|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Ethnic Malays among other ethnic groups in Indonesia.

In 1898, the British introduced coffee to the [[East Godavari]] district in [[Pamuluru]] before it spread to Araku in the early 19th century. After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two passengers, with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee for three months. The brand became so popular and exotic that Naidu gifted them to Korean and Russian delegates during their visits and the coffee was marketed in all the international investor meetings organized by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/Naidu-markets-Araku-coffee-at-womens-meet/articleshow/51893052.cms|title=Naidu markets Araku coffee at women's meet|date=19 April 2016 |work=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yovizag.com/araku-coffee-exotic-brand/|title=Coffee From Araku - Our Very Own Exotic Brand |date=27 May 2017|website=Yo Vizag|language=en-US|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu once said that Araku Valley\u2019s tribal coffee is competing with Columbian and Sumatran coffee in the international market.

In 1898, the British introduced coffee to the [[East Godavari]] district in [[Pamuluru]] before it spread to Araku in the early 19th century. After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two passengers, with their families, would get some free accommodation at Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee for three months. The brand got so popular and exotic that Naidu gifted them to Korean and Russian delegates during their visits and the coffee was marketed in all the international investor meetings organized by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/Naidu-markets-Araku-coffee-at-womens-meet/articleshow/51893052.cms|title=Naidu markets Araku coffee at women's meet|date=19 April 2016 |work=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yovizag.com/araku-coffee-exotic-brand/|title=Coffee From Araku - Our Very Own Exotic Brand |date=27 May 2017|website=Yo Vizag|language=en-US|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu once said that Araku Valley\u2019s tribal coffee is competing with Columbian and Sumatran coffee in the international market.

It is somewhat like a [[forklift]] but has a [[wikt:boom#Etymology 2|boom]] ([[Telescopic cylinder]]), making it more a [[crane (machine)|crane]] than a forklift, with the increased versatility of a single telescopic or articulating boom that can extend forwards and upwards from the vehicle. On the end of the boom the operator can fit one of several attachments, such as a bucket, [[pallet]] forks, muck grab, or [[winch]]. Telehandlers are sometimes called [[cherry picker]]s in North America, as that name can refer to any truck or [[heavy equipment]] that has such a boom.\n\n==Uses==\nIn industry the most common attachment for a telehandler is pallet forks and the most common application is to move loads to and from places unreachable for a conventional forklift. For example, telehandlers have the ability to remove palletised cargo from within a trailer and to place loads on rooftops and other high places. The latter application would otherwise require a crane, which is not always practical or time-efficient.\n\nIn agriculture the most common attachment for a telehandler is a bucket or bucket grab, again the most common application is to move loads to and from places unreachable for a 'conventional machine' which in this case is a wheeled loader or backhoe loader.{{cn|date=August 2019}} For example, telehandlers have the ability to reach directly into a high-sided trailer or hopper. The latter application would otherwise require a loading ramp, conveyor, or similar.\n\nThe telehandler can also work with a crane jib along with lifting loads, the attachments that include on the market are dirt buckets, grain buckets, rotators, power booms. The agricultural range can also be fitted with three point linkage and power take-off. \n\nThe advantage of the telehandler is also its biggest limitation: as the boom extends or raises while bearing a load, it acts as a lever and causes the vehicle to become increasingly unstable, despite counterweights in the rear. This means that the lifting capacity quickly decreases as the working radius (distance between the front of the wheels and the centre of the load) increases. When used as a loader the single boom (rather than twin arms) is very highly loaded and even with careful design is a weakness. A vehicle with a 5,000&nbsp;lb (2.5ton) capacity with the boom retracted may be able to safely lift as little as 400&nbsp;lb (225&nbsp;kg) with it fully extended at a low boom angle. The same machine with a 5,000&nbsp;lb lift capacity with the boom retracted may be able to support as much as 10,000&nbsp;lb (5ton) with the boom raised to 70\u00b0. The operator is equipped with a load chart which helps him determine whether a given task is possible, taking into account weight, boom angle and height. Failing this, most telehandlers now utilize a computer which uses sensors to monitor the vehicle, and will warn the operator and/or cut off further control input if the limits of the vehicle are exceeded, the latter being a legal requirement in Europe controlled by EN15000. Machines can also be equipped with front [[outriggers|stabilizers]] which extend the lifting capability of the equipment while stationary, as well machines which are fully stabilised with rotary joint between upper and lower frames, which can be called mobile [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] although they can typically still use a bucket, and are also often referred to as 'Roto' machines. They are a hybrid between a telehandler and small crane.\n\n== Licences for operating telehandlers in Australia ==\nA Gold Card can be obtained for telehandlers with a capacity of three tonnes or less for standard attachments where the machine is operated from below. The Gold Card is issued by the Telescopic Handler Association of Australia (TSHA).
