According to the [[United States Postal Service]], an address is valid (or mailable) if it is CASS-certified, meaning that it exists within the comprehensive list of mailable addresses in their [[Address Management System]]. This is different from the credit card [[Address Verification System]] (AVS), which is the method used by credit card processors to authenticate ownership of a credit card by verifying that the account on the credit card matches the billing address on file. Credit card AVS does not determine deliverability of an address.\n\n==Standardization==\nBefore an address can be certified as deliverable (CASS-certified), it must first be standardized. Standardization converts an address into a standard format by correcting the address, if possible, and adding missing information, such as a ZIP code, to produce a complete address containing a street address, city, state, and ZIP code.\n\nIf you live at a valid street address and find that it doesn't validate properly, you must contact your local United States Post Office and have the address validated and added to their system.\n\nThe following methods are used to achieve the most accurate address possible:<ref>{{cite web\n | title = What is CASS Processing\n | url = https://smartystreets.com/articles/cass-processing\n | website = SmartyStreets\n | access-date = March 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n\n\n===Abbreviation===\nUSPS approved abbreviations <ref>{{cite web | title=Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service, Publication 28 - Postal Addressing Standards |url=http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/welcome.htm | accessdate=2 February 2014 }}</ref> are used whenever possible to clarify and shorten the address.\n* '''Example:''' The term ''avenue'' may commonly be abbreviated AV, AVEN, or AVN or fully spelled out as ''avenue''.

These are typically city names and street names.  Due to the large number of possible misspellings, not all of them can be accurately detected and corrected.\n* '''Example:'''  The street address 1600 {{typo|ampytheatre}} parkways is corrected to 1600 Amphitheatre PKWY. The spelling of the city name as \"{{typo|pheonix}}\" is corrected to \"Phoenix\".\n\n===Uniform city names===\nMany cities have several different, commonly used names. Each ZIP Code in the Address Management System has one preferred city name and may have one or more acceptable city names.\n\nCASS-certified software accepts as standard any \"preferred\" or \"acceptable\" city for a five-digit ZIP Code. Only a city that is \"preferred\" or \"acceptable\" is recognized as standard. These systems attempt to correct incorrect city names and any that cannot be corrected are rejected.<ref>United States Postal Service ''Domestic Mail Manual'' [http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/602.htm] 602 Addressing. Retrieved 2012-09-21</ref>\n* '''Examples:''' \"New York City\", \"Empire State\", \"Greeley Square\" and \"Manhattan\" in ZIP Code 10001 is standardized to \"New York\". Meanwhile, the \"preferred\" city of \"Floral Park\" or either of the \"acceptable\" cities of \"Bellerose Village\" or \"South Floral Park\" is accepted as standard for use in ZIP Code 11001.<ref>United States Postal Service ''\"ZIP Code Lookup\"'' [https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input] Look Up a ZIP Code. Retrieved 2012-09-21</ref>\n\n===Completion===\nAn address must be complete in order to be valid.  This means that it must have a street, city, state and ZIP code.  Whenever possible, addresses that are incomplete have the missing information added.\n\nIf a valid ZIP code is provided but the city and state are missing, the city and state names are added.\n* '''Example:''' \"1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy 94043\" is expanded to \"1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy Mountain View CA 94043\"\n\nIf valid names for city and state are provided but the ZIP code is missing, the ZIP code is added.\n* \n'''Example:'''\nDethaw Cotman Jr\n2117 R Street SE corner 22st.\nWashington DC 20020\n\n==Delivery Point Validation==\nDelivery Point Validation (DPV) provides the highest level of address accuracy checking. In a DPV process, the address is checked against the USPS Address Management System (AMS) data file to ensure that it exists as an active delivery point.<ref name=\"Delivery Point Validation\">{{cite web|title=\n2004 Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations Chapter 2 Postal Operations|url=https://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/cs04/chp2-027.html|publisher=USPS|accessdate=9 September 2016}} 2004 Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations Chapter 2 Postal Operations</ref>  The USPS does not offer DPV validation on their website however there are companies that offer services to perform DPV verification and are certified by the USPS see also CASS Certification.<ref name=\"CASS Certification\">{{cite web|title=\nCASS software certification program provides hardware and software developers, service bureaus, and commercial mailers a common measure by which to test the quality of address-matching software|url=https://ribbs.usps.gov/index.cfm?page=cassmass|publisher=USPS|accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe standardized address is then compared against the entire list of valid addresses in the Address Management System to determine if it is a valid address.  Address validity is based on many different factors, including address renumbering (via the USPS [[Locatable Address Conversion System]]) and address completeness. If an exact match is not found, an acceptable alternative is used (if available).\n* '''Example:'''  123 North Main Street, New York, NY 10010 is an apartment building with 100 apartments in it. If an apartment number is not specified, the default address (lobby) is used for delivery.\n\nIf the address is valid, it is assigned a [[ZIP code|ZIP+4]] code something like this: 12344-5678, where the first five digits are the ZIP code and the trailing four digits are the delivery range.  An address with a ZIP+4 code (or nine-digit ZIP code) is considered to be valid.  In most cases, this means that the address is deliverable.  However, if the USPS has the address listed as \"VACANT\", it is not delivered, even though the address is valid.\n* '''''Note:''' An address can still be valid (but not deliverable by the USPS) if it is a remote location and only served by private carrier such as UPS or Fedex.''\n\n==Benefits==\n* Verify and correct addresses BEFORE mailing\n* Correct addresses in a list\n* Remove duplicated addresses from a list based on the standardized address\n* Qualify for USPS bulk mailing discounts<ref>[http://pe.usps.com/businessmail101/ USPS - Welcome to Business Mail 101<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* Minimize delivery delays by only using valid addresses\n\n==Providers==\nThe USPS offers address verification directly on their website.<ref>[http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/ USPS - ZIP Code Lookup - Search By Address<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Addresses are processed one at a time by typing the address into the provided fields.

The spelling of the city name as \"{{typo|pheonix}}\" is corrected to \"Phoenix\".\n\n===Uniform city names===\nMany cities have several different, commonly used names. Each ZIP Code in the Address Management System has one preferred city name and may have one or more acceptable city names.\n\nCASS-certified software accepts as standard any \"preferred\" or \"acceptable\" city for a five-digit ZIP Code. Only a city that is \"preferred\" or \"acceptable\" is recognized as standard. These systems attempt to correct incorrect city names and any that cannot be corrected are rejected.<ref>United States Postal Service ''Domestic Mail Manual'' [http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/602.htm] 602 Addressing. Retrieved 2012-09-21</ref>\n* '''Examples:''' \"New York City\", \"Empire State\", \"Greeley Square\" and \"Manhattan\" in ZIP Code 10001 is standardized to \"New York\". Meanwhile, the \"preferred\" city of \"Floral Park\" or either of the \"acceptable\" cities of \"Bellerose Village\" or \"South Floral Park\" is accepted as standard for use in ZIP Code 11001.<ref>United States Postal Service ''\"ZIP Code Lookup\"'' [https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input] Look Up a ZIP Code. Retrieved 2012-09-21</ref>\n\n===Completion===\nAn address must be complete in order to be valid.  This means that it must have a street, city, state and ZIP code.  Whenever possible, addresses that are incomplete have the missing information added.\n\nIf a valid ZIP code is provided but the city and state are missing, the city and state names are added.\n* '''Example:''' \"1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy 94043\" is expanded to \"1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy Mountain View CA 94043\"\n\nIf valid names for city and state are provided but the ZIP code is missing, the ZIP code is added.\n* \n'''Example:'''\nDethaw Cotman Jr\n2117 R Street SE corner 22st.\nWashington DC 20020\n\n==Delivery Point Validation==\nDelivery Point Validation (DPV) provides the highest level of address accuracy checking. In a DPV process, the address is checked against the USPS Address Management System (AMS) data file to ensure that it exists as an active delivery point.<ref name=\"Delivery Point Validation\">{{cite web|title=\n2004 Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations Chapter 2 Postal Operations|url=https://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/cs04/chp2-027.html|publisher=USPS|accessdate=9 September 2016}} 2004 Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations Chapter 2 Postal Operations</ref>  The USPS does not offer DPV validation on their website however there are companies that offer services to perform DPV verification and are certified by the USPS see also CASS Certification.<ref name=\"CASS Certification\">{{cite web|title=\nCASS software certification program provides hardware and software developers, service bureaus, and commercial mailers a common measure by which to test the quality of address-matching software|url=https://ribbs.usps.gov/index.cfm?page=cassmass|publisher=USPS|accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe standardized address is then compared against the entire list of valid addresses in the Address Management System to determine if it is a valid address.  Address validity is based on many different factors, including address renumbering (via the USPS [[Locatable Address Conversion System]]) and address completeness. If an exact match is not found, an acceptable alternative is used (if available).\n* '''Example:'''  123 North Main Street, New York, NY 10010 is an apartment building with 100 apartments in it. If an apartment number is not specified, the default address (lobby) is used for delivery.\n\nIf the address is valid, it is assigned a [[ZIP code|ZIP+4]] code something like this: 12344-5678, where the first five digits are the ZIP code and the trailing four digits are the delivery range.  An address with a ZIP+4 code (or nine-digit ZIP code) is considered to be valid.  In most cases, this means that the address is deliverable.  However, if the USPS has the address listed as \"VACANT\", it is not delivered, even though the address is valid.\n* '''''Note:''' An address can still be valid (but not deliverable by the USPS) if it is a remote location and only served by private carrier such as UPS or Fedex.''\n\n==Benefits==\n* Verify and correct addresses BEFORE mailing\n* Correct addresses in a list\n* Remove duplicated addresses from a list based on the standardized address\n* Qualify for USPS bulk mailing discounts<ref>[http://pe.usps.com/businessmail101/ USPS - Welcome to Business Mail 101<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* Minimize delivery delays by only using valid addresses\n\n==Providers==\nThe USPS offers address verification directly on their website.<ref>[http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/ USPS - ZIP Code Lookup - Search By Address<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Addresses are processed one at a time by typing the address into the provided fields.  The USPS also licenses their services to third-party companies that provide the CASS certification in bulk.<ref>http://ribbs.usps.gov/files/vendors/cassn01d.TXT</ref>  These third-party providers typically allow processing of address lists in CSV or Excel format.

Adapted from the [[Steve Jobs (book)|2011 biography]] by [[Walter Isaacson]] and interviews conducted by Sorkin, the film covers 14 years (1984\u20131998) in the life of [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. Jobs is portrayed by [[Michael Fassbender]], with [[Kate Winslet]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], and [[Jeff Daniels]] in supporting roles.\n\nDevelopment began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Filming began in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive on the project, with editor [[Elliot Graham]] while the film was still shooting. [[Daniel Pemberton]] served as composer, with a focus on dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.\n\n''Steve Jobs'' premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival|2015 Telluride Film Festival]] on September 5, 2015, and began a [[limited release]] in New York City and Los Angeles on October 9, 2015. It opened nationwide in the U.S. on October 23, 2015 to critical acclaim. People close to Jobs such as [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[John Sculley]] praised the performances, but the film also received criticism for historical inaccuracy. Winslet won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Best Supporting Actress and Sorkin won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay]] at the [[73rd Golden Globes]], while Fassbender and Winslet received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively, at the [[88th Academy Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->In 1984, the [[Macintosh 128K|Apple Macintosh 128K]]'s voice demo fails less than an hour before its unveiling at [[De Anza College|Flint Center]]. [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] demands engineer [[Andy Hertzfeld]] fix it, threatening to publicly implicate him in the presentation's credits if he does not. Hertzfeld finally suggests faking the demo using the prototype [[Macintosh 512K]] computer.\n\nJobs rants to marketing executive [[Joanna Hoffman]] about a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] \u2013 he denies he is the father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa]]. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him \u2013 she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her [[MacPaint]] art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] asks Jobs to acknowledge the [[Apple II]] team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.\n\nBy 1988, following the apparent failure of the Macintosh, Jobs has founded a new company, [[NeXT]]. Before the [[NeXT Computer]] launch at the [[War Memorial Opera House]], he spends time with 9-year-old Lisa, but his relationship with Brennan is still strained \u2013 he accuses her of irresponsible behavior and of using Lisa to get money from him. Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXT will be another failure. Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him, and Wozniak questions Jobs' contributions to computing history. Jobs defends his role as that of a conductor, who directs \"musicians\" like Wozniak.\n\nApple CEO [[John Sculley]] demands to know why the world believes he fired Jobs \u2013 Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.\n\nBy 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, purchased NeXT, and named Jobs CEO, and Jobs is about to unveil the [[iMac G3|iMac]] at [[Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall|Davies Symphony Hall]]. He is delighted by Hoffman's strong commercial forecasts, but furious that Lisa has allowed her mother to sell the house Jobs bought for them. Hoffman reminds Jobs that he threatened to withhold Lisa's college tuition \u2013 Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa's tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak again asks that Jobs credit the Apple II team during the presentation, and again he refuses.\n\nSculley arrives in secret and the two make amends. Jobs and Sculley discuss Jobs' life as an adopted child, and Jobs admits that his need for control stems from his feelings of powerlessness in being given up. At the behest of Hoffman, Jobs apologizes to Lisa for his mistakes and accepts that he is her father, admitting that he is \"poorly made.\" Lisa watches her father take the stage to introduce the iMac.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Steve Jobs]]:\n:Co-founder of [[Apple Inc.]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cultofmac.com/310397/meet-official-cast-steve-jobs-movie/ |title=Meet the official cast of the Steve Jobs movie |accessdate=July 12, 2015 |last=Hein |first=Buster |date=January 28, 2015 |work=Cultofmac |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317052105/http://www.cultofmac.com/310397/meet-official-cast-steve-jobs-movie/ |archive-date=March 17, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Fassbender acknowledged his lack of physical resemblance to Jobs, but stated that he was more interested in capturing Jobs' essence than his appearance.

I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [Hoffman]. Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [producer] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part.\"<ref name=\"Labrecque\" /> Winslet spent considerable time with [[Joanna Hoffman]] to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman \"has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues.\"<ref name=\"hoffman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |title=How Kate Winslet Won a Role in Steve Jobs and Managed All That Sorkin Dialogue |accessdate=August 26, 2016 |last=Kachka |first=Boris |date=August 26, 2015 |work=Vulture |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618180609/http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |archive-date=June 18, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs.<ref name=\"dbprem\" /> {{paragraph break}} On the nature of the relationship between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender \"were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass.\" In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she \"just wanted to please [Hoffman] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake.\"<ref name=hoffman/> Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman \"did genuinely love [Jobs]. And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional.

They also wanted each of the film's three time periods to visually reflect Jobs' own development at the time. For instance, K\u00fcchler explains that the filming at [[De Anza College|Flint Center, De Anza college]] for the first act combined the graininess of 16&nbsp;mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional, spontaneous look \u2013 much in the vein of how Jobs is portrayed at that time. The third act, shot with an [[Arri Alexa]] at the [[Davies Symphony Hall]], incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of Jobs' own design philosophies of the [[iMac]] and subsequent [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] hardware.

During the one-week rehearsal that took place in between production for each of the three acts (shot in chronological order), Graham worked on the existing footage and received ongoing feedback from Boyle in the editing room. In an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing the [[Shot (filmmaking)#Film editing|shot frequency]] and providing enough \"visual interventions\" to control for Sorkin's dialogue-heavy screenplay.

Much like the film's visual approach, the score is divided into three distinguishable sections, each corresponding to the intended feel of the act in which the section is heard. \"You have the first act which is analog,\" Pemberton explains, \"you have the second act which is orchestral, and you have the third act which is digital.\" For the first act's composition, Pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers, in particular ones released no later than 1984 \u2013 the time the first act takes place \u2013 such as the [[Roland SH-1000]] and [[Yamaha CS-80]]. The second act's score is more operatic in nature, matching the setting of the [[War Memorial Opera House|San Francisco Opera House]].

In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that \"the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if you made a movie called ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].

Adapted from the [[Steve Jobs (book)|2011 biography]] by [[Walter Isaacson]] and interviews conducted by Sorkin, the film covers 14 years (1984\u20131998) in the life of [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. Jobs is portrayed by [[Michael Fassbender]], with [[Kate Winslet]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], and [[Jeff Daniels]] in supporting roles.\n\nDevelopment began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Filming began in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive on the project, with editor [[Elliot Graham]] while the film was still shooting. [[Daniel Pemberton]] served as composer, with a focus on dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.\n\n''Steve Jobs'' premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival|2015 Telluride Film Festival]] on September 5, 2015, and began a [[limited release]] in New York City and Los Angeles on October 9, 2015. It opened nationwide in the U.S. on October 23, 2015 to critical acclaim. People close to Jobs such as [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[John Sculley]] praised the performances, but the film also received criticism for historical inaccuracy. Winslet won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Best Supporting Actress and Sorkin won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay]] at the [[73rd Golden Globes]], while Fassbender and Winslet received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively, at the [[88th Academy Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->In 1984, the [[Macintosh 128K|Apple Macintosh 128K]]'s voice demo fails less than an hour before its unveiling at [[De Anza College|Flint Center]]. [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] demands engineer [[Andy Hertzfeld]] fix it, threatening to publicly implicate him in the presentation's credits if he does not. Hertzfeld finally suggests faking the demo using the prototype [[Macintosh 512K]] computer.\n\nJobs rants to marketing executive [[Joanna Hoffman]] about a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] \u2013 he denies he is the father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa]]. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him \u2013 she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her [[MacPaint]] art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] asks Jobs to acknowledge the [[Apple II]] team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.\n\nBy 1988, following the apparent failure of the Macintosh, Jobs has founded a new company, [[NeXT]]. Before the [[NeXT Computer]] launch at the [[War Memorial Opera House]], he spends time with 9-year-old Lisa, but his relationship with Brennan is still strained \u2013 he accuses her of irresponsible behavior and of using Lisa to get money from him. Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXT will be another failure. Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him, and Wozniak questions Jobs' contributions to computing history. Jobs defends his role as that of a conductor, who directs \"musicians\" like Wozniak.\n\nApple CEO [[John Sculley]] demands to know why the world believes he fired Jobs \u2013 Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.\n\nBy 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, purchased NeXT, and named Jobs CEO, and Jobs is about to unveil the [[iMac G3|iMac]] at [[Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall|Davies Symphony Hall]]. He is delighted by Hoffman's strong commercial forecasts, but furious that Lisa has allowed her mother to sell the house Jobs bought for them. Hoffman reminds Jobs that he threatened to withhold Lisa's college tuition \u2013 Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa's tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak again asks that Jobs credit the Apple II team during the presentation, and again he refuses.\n\nSculley arrives in secret and the two make amends. Jobs and Sculley discuss Jobs' life as an adopted child, and Jobs admits that his need for control stems from his feelings of powerlessness in being given up. At the behest of Hoffman, Jobs apologizes to Lisa for his mistakes and accepts that he is her father, admitting that he is \"poorly made\". Lisa watches her father take the stage to introduce the iMac.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Steve Jobs]]:\n:Co-founder of [[Apple Inc.]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cultofmac.com/310397/meet-official-cast-steve-jobs-movie/ |title=Meet the official cast of the Steve Jobs movie |accessdate=July 12, 2015 |last=Hein |first=Buster |date=January 28, 2015 |work=Cultofmac |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317052105/http://www.cultofmac.com/310397/meet-official-cast-steve-jobs-movie/ |archive-date=March 17, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Fassbender acknowledged his lack of physical resemblance to Jobs, but stated that he was more interested in capturing Jobs' essence than his appearance.

She noted that Hoffman \"has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues.\"<ref name=\"hoffman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |title=How Kate Winslet Won a Role in Steve Jobs and Managed All That Sorkin Dialogue |accessdate=August 26, 2016 |last=Kachka |first=Boris |date=August 26, 2015 |work=Vulture |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618180609/http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |archive-date=June 18, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs.<ref name=\"dbprem\" /> {{paragraph break}} On the nature of the relationship between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender \"were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass.\" In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she \"just wanted to please [Hoffman] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake.\"<ref name=hoffman/> Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman \"did genuinely love [Jobs]. And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly.\"<ref name=\"dbprem\"/>\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as [[Steve Wozniak]]:\n:Co-founder of Apple and creator of the [[Apple II]].<ref name=\"cast\"/> Rogen admitted to not being familiar with Wozniak, let alone knowing he was co-founder of Apple.

They also wanted each of the film's three time periods to visually reflect Jobs' own development at the time. For instance, K\u00fcchler explains that the filming at [[De Anza College|Flint Center, De Anza college]] for the first act combined the graininess of 16&nbsp;mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional, spontaneous look \u2013 much in the vein of how Jobs is portrayed at that time. The third act, shot with an [[Arri Alexa]] at the [[Davies Symphony Hall]], incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of Jobs' own design philosophies of the [[iMac]] and subsequent [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] hardware. K\u00fcchler describes his experience filming ''Steve Jobs'' as \"brilliant and challenging at the same time\", and that the goal was to \"make sure that the visuals kept up with the words\", in reference to the production's collaboration between Boyle and Sorkin.<ref name=\"boylewired\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/steve-jobs-danny-boyle-interview/ |title=Why Danny Boyle Filmed Steve Jobs in Three Different Formats |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 16, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fsteve-jobs-danny-boyle-interview%2F&date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"kuchlerthalo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thalo.com/articles/view/1143/steve_jobs_dp_alwin_h_kchler_shoots_in_three_acts |title=Steve Jobs DP Alwin H.

During the one-week rehearsal that took place in between production for each of the three acts (shot in chronological order), Graham worked on the existing footage and received ongoing feedback from Boyle in the editing room. In an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing the [[Shot (filmmaking)#Film editing|shot frequency]] and providing enough \"visual interventions\" to control for Sorkin's dialogue-heavy screenplay. He described approaching each scene as \"a series of fight sequences\".

Much like the film's visual approach, the score is divided into three distinguishable sections, each corresponding to the intended feel of the act in which the section is heard. \"You have the first act which is analog,\" Pemberton explains, \"you have the second act which is orchestral, and you have the third act which is digital.\" For the first act's composition, Pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers, in particular ones released no later than 1984 \u2013 the time the first act takes place \u2013 such as the [[Roland SH-1000]] and [[Yamaha CS-80]]. The second act's score is more operatic in nature, matching the setting of the [[War Memorial Opera House|San Francisco Opera House]]. Finally, the third act featured a more introspective score produced entirely digitally to complement its backdrop of the 1998 iMac product launch, and Pemberton correspondingly used his own iMac to compose this section.<ref name=\"pembertonpop\">{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/a-symphony-in-three-parts-breaking-down-the-steve-jobs-score-with-composer-/ |title=Breaking Down the 'Steve Jobs' Score with Composer Daniel Pemberton |first=Cory |last=Woodroof |work=[[PopMatters]] |date=November 13, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popmatters.com%2Ffeature%2Fa-symphony-in-three-parts-breaking-down-the-steve-jobs-score-with-composer-%2F+&date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"pembertonvariety\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/movie-maestros-mix-organic-and-synthetic-sounds-1201632653/ |title=Movie Maestros Mix Organic and Synthetic Sounds |first=Joe |last=Burlingame |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 3, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2015%2Ffilm%2Fnews%2Fmovie-maestros-mix-organic-and-synthetic-sounds-1201632653%2F&date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"pembertonclash\">{{cite web |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/daniel-pemberton-scoring-steve-jobs |title=Daniel Pemberton: Scoring Steve Jobs |first=Paul |last=Weedon |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |date=November 18, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clashmusic.com%2Ffeatures%2Fdaniel-pemberton-scoring-steve-jobs&date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"deadlinepemberton\">{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2015/12/steve-jobs-composer-daniel-pemberton-oscars-2015-best-score-1201617583/ |title='Steve Jobs' Composer Daniel Pemberton Blended Nostalgia And Futurism |first=Anthony |last=D'Alessandro |work=[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]] |date=December 5, 2015 |accessdate=December 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2015%2F12%2Fsteve-jobs-composer-daniel-pemberton-oscars-2015-best-score-1201617583%2F&date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack also features songs by [[The Libertines]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Maccabees (band)|The Maccabees]].
