Both games count toward official statistics, but are not considered series.\n\nAfter Queensland had won the [[1987 State of Origin series]] 2-1, a further game was played in [[Long Beach, California]] to showcase [[rugby league]] to the [[United States|American]] public. On 15 July 2003 the Australian Rugby League announced that this game was to be classified as an \"official match\" and that the match would count towards the players' individual statistics and overall match win-loss-draw records. However, the match has not counted towards series win-loss-draw records and the 1987 series still remains a 2-1 win to Queensland.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!

Both games count toward official statistics, but are not considered series.\n\nAfter Queensland had won the [[1987 State of Origin series]] 2-1, a further game was played in [[Long Beach, California]] to showcase [[rugby league]] to the [[United States|American]] public. On 15 July 2003 the Australian Rugby League announced that this game was to be classified as an \"official match\" and that the match would count towards the players' individual statistics and overall match win-loss-draw records. However, the match has not counted towards series win-loss-draw records and the 1987 series still remains a 2-1 win to Queensland.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!

He has provided commentary for the [[Nine Network]]'s coverage of rugby league since joining the network in 1992 and has also hosted ''[[The Footy Show (rugby league)|The Footy Show]]'' since its beginnings in 1994 opposite co-host [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]], until 2017. An [[Australian Kangaroos]] test and [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]] [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] representative lock or second-row forward, Vautin played club football in Brisbane with [[Wests Panthers|Wests]], before moving to Sydney in 1979 to play with [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]], whom he would captain to the [[1987 NSWRL premiership]]. He also played for Sydney's [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]], and in England for [[St Helens R.F.C.|St Helens]].\n\nAfter playing, Vautin became a sports commentator for the Nine Network, calling rugby league games alongside [[Ray Warren]] and the recently retired [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]]. Later, during the [[Super League war]], he was hired to coach Queensland in the [[1995 State of Origin series]] and took the Maroons to an upset 3\u20130 whitewash of series favourite [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]].\n\nAccording to Vautin, he earned his nickname \"Fatty\" soon after joining Manly in 1979. While being shown around [[Brookvale Oval]] by club secretary [[Ken Arthurson]], he walked past retired Manly premiership captain [[Fred Jones (rugby league)|Fred Jones]] who was in conversation with club and [[Australian Kangaroos|Kangaroos]] fullback [[Graham Eadie]]. Jones asked Eadie \"Who is that fatty?\", and the name stuck.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Playing career==\nVautin made his name in the late 1970s. He played for the [[Wests Panthers]] in the [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership]], the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] in Sydney, [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] in England, [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]] in the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] and the [[Australia national rugby league team]]. He finished his playing career with Sydney club the [[Eastern Suburbs Roosters]] in 1991.\n\n===Club===\n\n====Wests Panthers====\n\nHe was graded as an 18-year-old by [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership|Brisbane Rugby League]] club Wests as a {{rlp|LK}} in 1978, sometimes playing opposite another talented young lock from [[Fortitude Valley Diehards|Valley's]] destined for future greatness as a {{rlp|FE}} named [[Wally Lewis]]. Vautin was signed by Manly-Warringah club Secretary Ken Arthurson in late 1978 after Arthurson had viewed a tape of him scoring a 75-metre try from a scrum for Wests at [[Lang Park]], and moved from Brisbane to play for the defending NSWRFL premiers starting in [[1979 NSWRFL season|1979]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arsNzoW2Ozs|title=Fatty visits The King - NRL Footy Show|last=LuckieBoot|date=15 August 2013|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n====Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles====\nAfter playing [[New South Wales Cup#Reserve Grade/Presidents Cup/First Division Premiers (1908\u20132002)|Reserve Grade]] for Manly in the opening round of the 1979 season, against [[St. George Dragons|St. George]] at [[Kogarah Oval]],\n\nVautin went on to play in grand finals with Manly in [[1982 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|1982]] and [[1983 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|1983]], going down to Parramatta both times.\n\nVautin was named captain of Manly-Warringah in [[1985 NSWRL season|1985]] by coach [[Bob Fulton]].\n\nVautin enjoyed success in leading Manly to an 18\u20138 victory over the [[Canberra Raiders]] in the [[1987 NSWRL Grand Final|1987 Grand Final]], the last played at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. Before the 1987 season had started, the Manly club board had wanted Bob Fulton to install [[1986 Kangaroo tour]] second rower [[Noel Cleal]] as club captain {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}, replacing Vautin who had captained the side since 1985.\n\nFollowing the grand final victory in 1987, he traveled with Manly to England for the [[1987 World Club Challenge]] against their champions, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]. The home side won a try-less game 8\u20132 at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]].<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-club-challenge-1987/wigan-warriors-vs-manly-warringah-sea-eagles.html 1987 World Club Challenge - Wigan vs Manly-Warringah]</ref> During the match, Vautin was tackled over the sideline in front of the main grandstand. After easily being the best side in the Sydney competition during the year, and after the unbeaten 1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, the Manly players later admitted to over-confidence and took the game far too lightly, treating the trip more as a holiday than anything serious and actually continued their grand final celebrations while in England.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D2ZSjfjg2E Wigan v Manly - 1987 World Club Challenge highlights]</ref>\n\n====St. Helens====\nVautin and Manly teammate Michael O'Connor both signed to play for the [[Alex Murphy (rugby league)|Alex Murphy]] coached [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] during the [[1988\u201389 Rugby Football League season]] on 2 August 1988. Fatty would go on to captain St. Helens in his last match for them, a 27\u20130 loss to Wigan in the [[Challenge Cup|1989 Challenge Cup Final]] played on 29 April 1989 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in front of 78,000 fans. It was the first time since 1952 that a team had been held scoreless.<ref>[http://www.saints.org.uk/saints.org.uk/home/viewpage.php?page_id=10&num=16470 Paul Vautin]. saints.org.uk</ref> Vautin played 21 games for St. Helens in 1988\u201389 and made his d\u00e9but in English club football on 9 October 1988 in a 30\u201322 win over [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] at [[Old Craven Park|Craven Park]] in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].\n\n====Eastern Suburbs Roosters====\nHe signed with the Eastern Suburbs Roosters for two years, where he even spent time in reserve grade after being dropped by coach [[Mark Murray (rugby league)|Mark Murray]] - a former Queensland and Australian teammate, before retiring at the end of the [[1991 NSWRL season]]. His last game for the out of contention Roosters was an 8-42 loss to eventual premiers Penrith at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] on 25 August, the final round of the season.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===State of Origin===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2018}}\nVautin made his Origin d\u00e9but for the [[Queensland Maroons|Maroons]] in game 2 of the [[1982 State of Origin series|1982 series]]. He was originally selected as the starting lock forward but was moved to the bench on the day of the game {{citation needed|date=July 2017}} by coach [[Arthur Beetson]] in favor of [[Rod Morris]] who ended up putting in a man of the match performance. Vautin came on in the second half and, with Queensland leading 8\u20137, scored the winning try for the Maroons that kept the series alive after [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] had won game 1. Queensland went on to win game 3 of the series at the SCG where Vautin again started from the bench.\n\nIn 1984, Vautin and Manly teammate [[Chris Close]] became the last Queensland representative players to be selected for the annual [[City vs Country Origin|NSW City vs NSW Country]] game, when he was selected in the second row for [[City New South Wales rugby league team|NSW City]] for the game at the SCG, won 38\u201312 by City.\n\nFor the next nine years, with the exception of [[1986 State of Origin series|1986]] when he was not considered for selection due to his broken arm,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} he was a regular in those star-studded Queensland sides which included test captains Wally Lewis and [[Mal Meninga]], as well as [[Gene Miles]], [[Gary Belcher]], [[Bob Lindner]], [[Greg Dowling]] and [[Allan Langer]], and Manly teammates Chris Close, Dale Shearer, [[John Ribot]] and [[Kerry Boustead]], and produced many inspirational performances over 22 games. He had the honor of captaining the Queensland side in the first game of the [[1988 State of Origin series]] at the new Sydney Football Stadium, and the first game of the [[1990 State of Origin series|1990 series]] at [[Olympic Park Stadium|Olympic Park]] in [[Melbourne]] - the first Origin game in Australia played outside of Brisbane or Sydney. Both times he captained the team was when Lewis was ruled out with injury. At the time he became only the third Queensland Origin captain at the time alongside Beetson and Lewis.\n\nGame 1 of the 1990 series was Vautin's last game of State of Origin football as he was dumped after Queensland lost 0\u20138 to NSW after having won both the previous two series 3\u20130.\n\n===International===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2017}}\nVautin made his test d\u00e9but for [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] in [[1982 New Zealand rugby league tour of Australia and Papua New Guinea|1982]] in the first test against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]], at [[Lang Park]] in Brisbane under the coaching of his original Manly coach Frank Stanton. However, after playing for Queensland and Australia, and helping Manly to second on the ladder and then into the grand final against minor premiers Parramatta, he was not selected for the end of season [[1982 Kangaroo tour]].\n\nHe returned to the test team for Australia's mid-season tour to New Zealand in 1983, and in 1984 was selected for the second [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes]] Test against [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] at Lang Park, copping an elbow to the face from replacement [[Mick Adams]] as he tackled the Lions forward, resulting in a fractured cheekbone during the 18\u20136 win which saw Australia retain The Ashes. Vautin's injury kept him out of the third test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, and caused him to miss 11 games of the [[1984 NSWRL season]].\n\nVautin played 13 test matches during his career, touring New Zealand twice in [[1985 Kangaroo Tour of New Zealand|1985]] and [[1989 Kangaroo Tour of New Zealand|1989]]. In addition to the thirteen tests he played for Australia, he played two tour games in New Zealand in 1985 and three tour games in 1989.\n\nVautin was selected for Australia in their successful 1988 Ashes series against the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour|Great Britain]] tourists. As a result of being selected for the first test, Vautin missed playing in Manly's 30\u20130 demolition of Great Britain at Brookvale Oval only four days before the first test. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nVautin was the vice-captain of Australia's [[1989 Kangaroo Tour of New Zealand|mid-season tour of New Zealand]] in 1989, captaining the team in three tour games (Wally Lewis was the tour and test captain). Fatty captained the Australian team (now coached by Bob Fulton) to a 50\u201318 win over a [[New Zealand XIII]] at the [[Palmerston North Showgrounds]] in the opening game of the tour. He would later captain the side in another tour game against [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] for the only loss of the tour, the Australians surprised 26\u201324 at [[Carlaw Park]] (the Kangaroos first non-test loss since losing to [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] on the [[1978 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1978 Kangaroo tour]]), before captaining the team from the unfamiliar position of {{rlp|FE}} for a 28\u201310 win over [[Wellington rugby league team|Wellington]] at the [[Basin Reserve]].\n\nDuring his career, Vautin often had to compete with players such as Ray Price, Wayne Pearce and fellow Queenslander Bob Lindner for the Australian Lock-forward position, and as such was often selected in the second row. Of his 13 test matches, Vautin played 8 in the second row, 4 at lock and one (a 70\u20138 win over [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] in [[Wagga Wagga]] in 1988) from the bench.\n\n==Coaching career==\nLoyal to his [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] employer, Vautin was a vocal supporter of the [[Kerry Packer]]-backed [[Australian Rugby League]] during the [[Super League war]] which started in 1995. With only limited coaching experience having coached the [[Brisbane Capitols]] to the [[Winfield State League]] championship in 1992 (winning all 5 games), he was considered an inferior replacement for dual premiership winning coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]] who was originally named to return as coach of the 1995 Queensland State of Origin team (Bennett had previously coached the Maroons from 1986-1988), and with Queensland having lost the last three consecutive series and being given a handful of young and inexperienced players, Vautin and Queensland were expected to be easy prey for NSW, who could still boast almost half a side of international players as well as Origin and dual premiership winning coach [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]]. However, his representative coaching d\u00e9but took a fairy tale turn when the young Maroons, without any of the stars from [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]]-aligned clubs (most notably the Wayne Bennett coached [[Brisbane Broncos]]), completed a 3\u20130 series whitewash of New South Wales that year.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Colman|first1=Mike|title=Super League: The Inside Story|date=1996|publisher=Pan Macmillan Australia Pty Ltd.|location=Sydney|isbn=0-330-35863-4|pages=211\u2013216 Tomorrow The World}}</ref>\n\nWith the Super League players available for selection in the [[1996 State of Origin series]], Queensland were rated a chance of retaining their crown but lost the series 0\u20133. After losing the [[1997 State of Origin series|1997 series]] 1\u20132, Vautin was replaced as Queensland coach the following year by [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]].\n\n==Post-football career==\nIn 2000, Vautin was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]] for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league.\n\n===Commentary===\nAfter Manly had been knocked out of the finals series, Paul Vautin made his television commentary d\u00e9but during the [[1988 NSWRL season|1988 NSWRL Grand Final]] with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] alongside long time caller David Morrow. Vautin's introduction to television commentary did not go to plan though as he thought they were pre-recording the introduction to the game and dropped the \"F-bomb\", only to find out that it was in fact being broadcast live around Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG3MYQHTnWk|title=Paul 'Fatty' Vautin TV d\u00e9but - ABC - 1988|last=csotiri|date=27 July 2009|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nVautin was then signed by the [[Nine Network]] and has been a regular commentator for [[Nine's Wide World of Sports]]' coverage of rugby league matches alongside [[Ray Warren]] and [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]] since 1992.\n[[File:The Footy Show Cast 2016 TV Week Logie Awards (26907782585).jpg|thumb|left|Paul Vautin (on the left) at 2016 [[TV Week Logie Awards]]]]\n{{Quotation|[[Tim Brasher]] actually fell over in front of [[Tony Smith (rugby league b. 1970)|Tony Smith]].

He has provided commentary for the [[Nine Network]]'s coverage of rugby league since joining the network in 1992 and has also hosted ''[[The Footy Show (rugby league)|The Footy Show]]'' since its beginnings in 1994 opposite co-host [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]], until 2017. An [[Australian Kangaroos]] test and [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]] [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] representative lock or second-row forward, Vautin played club football in Brisbane with [[Wests Panthers|Wests]], before moving to Sydney in 1979 to play with [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]], whom he would captain to the [[1987 NSWRL premiership]]. He also played for Sydney's [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]], and in England for [[St Helens R.F.C.|St Helens]].\n\nAfter playing, Vautin became a sports commentator for the Nine Network, calling rugby league games alongside [[Ray Warren]] and the recently retired [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]]. Later, during the [[Super League war]], he was hired to coach Queensland in the [[1995 State of Origin series]] and took the Maroons to an upset 3\u20130 whitewash of series favourite [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]].\n\nAccording to Vautin, he earned his nickname \"Fatty\" soon after joining Manly in 1979. While being shown around [[Brookvale Oval]] by club secretary [[Ken Arthurson]], he walked past retired Manly premiership captain [[Fred Jones (rugby league)|Fred Jones]] who was in conversation with club and [[Australian Kangaroos|Kangaroos]] fullback [[Graham Eadie]]. Jones asked Eadie \"Who is that fatty?\", and the name stuck.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Playing career==\nVautin made his name in the late 1970s. He played for the [[Wests Panthers]] in the [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership]], the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] in Sydney, [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] in England, [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]] in the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] and the [[Australia national rugby league team]]. He finished his playing career with Sydney club the [[Eastern Suburbs Roosters]] in 1991.\n\n===Club===\n\n====Wests Panthers====\n\nHe was graded as an 18-year-old by [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership|Brisbane Rugby League]] club Wests as a {{rlp|LK}} in 1978, sometimes playing opposite another talented young lock from [[Fortitude Valley Diehards|Valley's]] destined for future greatness as a {{rlp|FE}} named [[Wally Lewis]]. Vautin was signed by Manly-Warringah club Secretary Ken Arthurson in late 1978 after Arthurson had viewed a tape of him scoring a 75-metre try from a scrum for Wests at [[Lang Park]], and moved from Brisbane to play for the defending NSWRFL premiers starting in [[1979 NSWRFL season|1979]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arsNzoW2Ozs|title=Fatty visits The King - NRL Footy Show|last=LuckieBoot|date=15 August 2013|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n====Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles====\nAfter playing [[New South Wales Cup#Reserve Grade/Presidents Cup/First Division Premiers (1908\u20132002)|Reserve Grade]] for Manly in the opening round of the 1979 season, against [[St. George Dragons|St. George]] at [[Kogarah Oval]],\n\nVautin went on to play in grand finals with Manly in [[1982 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|1982]] and [[1983 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|1983]], going down to Parramatta both times.\n\nVautin was named captain of Manly-Warringah in [[1985 NSWRL season|1985]] by coach [[Bob Fulton]].\n\nVautin enjoyed success in leading Manly to an 18\u20138 victory over the [[Canberra Raiders]] in the [[1987 NSWRL Grand Final|1987 Grand Final]], the last played at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. Before the 1987 season had started, the Manly club board had wanted Bob Fulton to install [[1986 Kangaroo tour]] second rower [[Noel Cleal]] as club captain {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}, replacing Vautin who had captained the side since 1985.\n\nFollowing the grand final victory in 1987, he traveled with Manly to England for the [[1987 World Club Challenge]] against their champions, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]. The home side won a try-less game 8\u20132 at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]].<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-club-challenge-1987/wigan-warriors-vs-manly-warringah-sea-eagles.html 1987 World Club Challenge - Wigan vs Manly-Warringah]</ref> During the match, Vautin was tackled over the sideline in front of the main grandstand. After easily being the best side in the Sydney competition during the year, and after the unbeaten 1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, the Manly players later admitted to over-confidence and took the game far too lightly, treating the trip more as a holiday than anything serious and actually continued their grand final celebrations while in England.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D2ZSjfjg2E Wigan v Manly - 1987 World Club Challenge highlights]</ref>\n\n====St. Helens====\nVautin and Manly teammate Michael O'Connor both signed to play for the [[Alex Murphy (rugby league)|Alex Murphy]] coached [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] during the [[1988\u201389 Rugby Football League season]] on 2 August 1988. Fatty would go on to captain St. Helens in his last match for them, a 27\u20130 loss to Wigan in the [[Challenge Cup|1989 Challenge Cup Final]] played on 29 April 1989 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in front of 78,000 fans. It was the first time since 1952 that a team had been held scoreless.<ref>[http://www.saints.org.uk/saints.org.uk/home/viewpage.php?page_id=10&num=16470 Paul Vautin]. saints.org.uk</ref> Vautin played 21 games for St. Helens in 1988\u201389 and made his d\u00e9but in English club football on 9 October 1988 in a 30\u201322 win over [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] at [[Old Craven Park|Craven Park]] in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].\n\n====Eastern Suburbs Roosters====\nHe signed with the Eastern Suburbs Roosters for two years, where he even spent time in reserve grade after being dropped by coach [[Mark Murray (rugby league)|Mark Murray]] - a former Queensland and Australian teammate, before retiring at the end of the [[1991 NSWRL season]]. His last game for the out of contention Roosters was an 8-42 loss to eventual premiers Penrith at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] on 25 August, the final round of the season.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===State of Origin===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2018}}\nVautin made his Origin d\u00e9but for the [[Queensland Maroons|Maroons]] in game 2 of the [[1982 State of Origin series|1982 series]]. He was originally selected as the starting lock forward but was moved to the bench on the day of the game {{citation needed|date=July 2017}} by coach [[Arthur Beetson]] in favor of [[Rod Morris]] who ended up putting in a man of the match performance. Vautin came on in the second half and, with Queensland leading 8\u20137, scored the winning try for the Maroons that kept the series alive after [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] had won game 1. Queensland went on to win game 3 of the series at the SCG where Vautin again started from the bench.\n\nIn 1984, Vautin and Manly teammate [[Chris Close]] became the last Queensland representative players to be selected for the annual [[City vs Country Origin|NSW City vs NSW Country]] game, when he was selected in the second row for [[City New South Wales rugby league team|NSW City]] for the game at the SCG, won 38\u201312 by City.\n\nFor the next nine years, with the exception of [[1986 State of Origin series|1986]] when he was not considered for selection due to his broken arm,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} he was a regular in those star-studded Queensland sides which included test captains Wally Lewis and [[Mal Meninga]], as well as [[Gene Miles]], [[Gary Belcher]], [[Bob Lindner]], [[Greg Dowling]] and [[Allan Langer]], and Manly teammates Chris Close, Dale Shearer, [[John Ribot]] and [[Kerry Boustead]], and produced many inspirational performances over 22 games. He had the honor of captaining the Queensland side in the first game of the [[1988 State of Origin series]] at the new Sydney Football Stadium, and the first game of the [[1990 State of Origin series|1990 series]] at [[Olympic Park Stadium|Olympic Park]] in [[Melbourne]] - the first Origin game in Australia played outside of Brisbane or Sydney. Both times he captained the team was when Lewis was ruled out with injury. At the time he became only the third Queensland Origin captain at the time alongside Beetson and Lewis.\n\nGame 1 of the 1990 series was Vautin's last game of State of Origin football as he was dumped after Queensland lost 0\u20138 to NSW after having won both the previous two series 3\u20130.\n\n===International===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2017}}\nVautin made his test d\u00e9but for [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] in [[1982 New Zealand rugby league tour of Australia and Papua New Guinea|1982]] in the first test against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]], at [[Lang Park]] in Brisbane under the coaching of his original Manly coach Frank Stanton. However, after playing for Queensland and Australia, and helping Manly to second on the ladder and then into the grand final against minor premiers Parramatta, he was not selected for the end of season [[1982 Kangaroo tour]].\n\nHe returned to the test team for Australia's mid-season tour to New Zealand in 1983, and in 1984 was selected for the second [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes]] Test against [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] at Lang Park, copping an elbow to the face from replacement [[Mick Adams]] as he tackled the Lions forward, resulting in a fractured cheekbone during the 18\u20136 win which saw Australia retain The Ashes. Vautin's injury kept him out of the third test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, and caused him to miss 11 games of the [[1984 NSWRL season]].\n\nVautin played 13 test matches during his career, touring New Zealand twice in [[1985 Kangaroo Tour of New Zealand|1985]] and [[1989 Kangaroo Tour of New Zealand|1989]]. In addition to the thirteen tests he played for Australia, he played two tour games in New Zealand in 1985 and three tour games in 1989.\n\nVautin was selected for Australia in their successful 1988 Ashes series against the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour|Great Britain]] tourists. As a result of being selected for the first test, Vautin missed playing in Manly's 30\u20130 demolition of Great Britain at Brookvale Oval only four days before the first test. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nVautin was the vice-captain of Australia's [[1989 Kangaroo Tour of New Zealand|mid-season tour of New Zealand]] in 1989, captaining the team in three tour games (Wally Lewis was the tour and test captain). Fatty captained the Australian team (now coached by Bob Fulton) to a 50\u201318 win over a [[New Zealand XIII]] at the [[Palmerston North Showgrounds]] in the opening game of the tour. He would later captain the side in another tour game against [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] for the only loss of the tour, the Australians surprised 26\u201324 at [[Carlaw Park]] (the Kangaroos first non-test loss since losing to [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] on the [[1978 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1978 Kangaroo tour]]), before captaining the team from the unfamiliar position of {{rlp|FE}} for a 28\u201310 win over [[Wellington rugby league team|Wellington]] at the [[Basin Reserve]].\n\nDuring his career, Vautin often had to compete with players such as Ray Price, Wayne Pearce and fellow Queenslander Bob Lindner for the Australian Lock-forward position, and as such was often selected in the second row. Of his 13 test matches, Vautin played 8 in the second row, 4 at lock and one (a 70\u20138 win over [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] in [[Wagga Wagga]] in 1988) from the bench.\n\n==Coaching career==\nLoyal to his [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] employer, Vautin was a vocal supporter of the [[Kerry Packer]]-backed [[Australian Rugby League]] during the [[Super League war]] which started in 1995. With only limited coaching experience having coached the [[Brisbane Capitols]] to the [[Winfield State League]] championship in 1992 (winning all 5 games), he was considered an inferior replacement for dual premiership winning coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]] who was originally named to return as coach of the 1995 Queensland State of Origin team (Bennett had previously coached the Maroons from 1986-1988), and with Queensland having lost the last three consecutive series and being given a handful of young and inexperienced players, Vautin and Queensland were expected to be easy prey for NSW, who could still boast almost half a side of international players as well as Origin and dual premiership winning coach [[Phil Gould]]. However, his representative coaching d\u00e9but took a fairy tale turn when the young Maroons, without any of the stars from [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]]-aligned clubs (most notably the Wayne Bennett coached [[Brisbane Broncos]]), completed a 3\u20130 series whitewash of New South Wales that year.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Colman|first1=Mike|title=Super League: The Inside Story|date=1996|publisher=Pan Macmillan Australia Pty Ltd.|location=Sydney|isbn=0-330-35863-4|pages=211\u2013216 Tomorrow The World}}</ref>\n\nWith the Super League players available for selection in the [[1996 State of Origin series]], Queensland were rated a chance of retaining their crown but lost the series 0\u20133. After losing the [[1997 State of Origin series|1997 series]] 1\u20132, Vautin was replaced as Queensland coach the following year by [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]].\n\n==Post-football career==\nIn 2000, Vautin was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]] for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league.\n\n===Commentary===\nAfter Manly had been knocked out of the finals series, Paul Vautin made his television commentary d\u00e9but during the [[1988 NSWRL season|1988 NSWRL Grand Final]] with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] alongside long time caller David Morrow. Vautin's introduction to television commentary did not go to plan though as he thought they were pre-recording the introduction to the game and dropped the \"F-bomb\", only to find out that it was in fact being broadcast live around Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG3MYQHTnWk|title=Paul 'Fatty' Vautin TV d\u00e9but - ABC - 1988|last=csotiri|date=27 July 2009|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nVautin was then signed by the [[Nine Network]] and has been a regular commentator for [[Nine's Wide World of Sports]]' coverage of rugby league matches alongside [[Ray Warren]] and [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]] since 1992.\n[[File:The Footy Show Cast 2016 TV Week Logie Awards (26907782585).jpg|thumb|left|Paul Vautin (on the left) at 2016 [[TV Week Logie Awards]]]]\n{{Quotation|[[Tim Brasher]] actually fell over in front of [[Tony Smith (rugby league b. 1970)|Tony Smith]].

He is the nephew of the 1960s [[St George Dragons|St. George]] star [[Reg Gasnier]].

After a night of heavy drinking he and team-mates [[Anthony Minichiello]] (who was also dropped), [[Craig Wing]] and [[Craig Gower]] were in a taxi when Gasnier rang a number on Minchiello's mobile phone, leaving an obscene message.

Again Gasnier won the Dally M Centre of the Year.\n\nIn early 2007 it was announced that Mark Gasnier, [[Ben Hornby]] and [[Jason Ryles]] would captain St George Illawarra. Controversially, given his reputation as centre, Gasnier was moved to {{rlp|FE}} for the Dragons following [[Trent Barrett]]'s move to the Wigan Warriors.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, Gasnier tore his pectoral muscle tackling [[Nigel Vagana]] in the [[Rugby League Charity Shield (Australia)|Charity Shield]] pre-season trial and was unable to play again until July. On 21 July, Gasnier made his long-awaited return to the Dragons, in the five-eighth position, with his team winning 38\u201320 against the Penrith Panthers. Despite Gasnier's shortened season, he was selected for the [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian Kangaroos]] in October to play the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand Kiwis]] in [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]]. Gasnier spent 24 minutes on the field before being knocked out by a [[Steve Matai]] high tackle.

In July, Gasnier reported that he would switch to rugby union at the end of the season to link up with French club [[Stade Fran\u00e7ais]].

After an exchange of declarations between both countries, the Spanish troops finally evicted the Moroccan infantry who had relieved their Navy comrades.\n\n==Background==\n[[Perejil Island]] (''Isla Perejil'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and ''Jazirat Laila'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) is a small rocky island under Spanish sovereignty  and about the size of 15 football fields, lying {{convert|250|m|yd}} from Morocco, and {{convert|8|km|mi}} from the Spanish city of [[Ceuta]], which borders Morocco, and {{convert|13.5|km|mi}} from mainland Spain. The island itself is unpopulated, only seldom visited by Moroccan shepherds.\n\n==Moroccan seizure==\nTensions rose on July 11, 2002, when 12 Moroccan soldiers landed on the island, equipped with light arms, a radio, and several tents. The soldiers raised their nation's flag and set up camp. A patrol boat of the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Spanish Civil Guard]], in charge of [[coast guard]] service in Spain, approached the island from [[Ceuta]] during its routine check, when the crew spotted the Moroccan flag flying. The officers disembarked to investigate the issue. When they landed on the island, they were confronted by the Moroccan soldiers, who forced them back into their boat at gunpoint after a bitter argument.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/13/spain.gilestremlett|title=Moroccans seize Parsley Island and leave a bitter taste in Spanish mouths|author=Giles Tremlett|work=the Guardian|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0717/27740-perejil/|title=Spain removes Moroccan troops from Perejil|date=17 July 2002|work=RTE.ie|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telquel-online.com/153/sujet3.shtml|title=Telquel-Online.com|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nMorocco claimed that the occupation was carried out in order to monitor illegal immigration, and to fight drug dealers and smugglers who use the island as a logistic platform.<ref>[http://www.elfaroceutamelilla.es/content/view/24521/69/ Consiguen el pase de 10 toneladas de droga almacenadas en isla Perejil.

The incident took place over the small, uninhabited [[Perejil Island]], when a squad of the [[Royal Moroccan Navy]] occupied it. After an exchange of declarations between both countries, the Spanish troops finally evicted the Moroccan infantry who had relieved their Navy comrades.\n\n==Background==\n[[Perejil Island]] (''Isla Perejil'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and ''Jazirat Laila'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) is a small rocky island under Spanish sovereignty  and about the size of 15 football fields, lying {{convert|250|m|yd}} from Morocco, and {{convert|8|km|mi}} from the Spanish city of [[Ceuta]], which borders Morocco, and {{convert|13.5|km|mi}} from mainland Spain. The island itself is unpopulated, only seldom visited by Moroccan shepherds.\n\n==Moroccan seizure==\nTensions rose on July 11, 2002, when 12 Moroccan soldiers landed on the island, equipped with light arms, a radio, and several tents. The soldiers raised their nation's flag and set up camp. A patrol boat of the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Spanish Civil Guard]], in charge of [[coast guard]] service in Spain, approached the island from [[Ceuta]] during its routine check, when the crew spotted the Moroccan flag flying. The officers disembarked to investigate the issue. When they landed on the island, they were confronted by the Moroccan soldiers, who forced them back into their boat at gunpoint after a bitter argument.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/13/spain.gilestremlett|title=Moroccans seize Parsley Island and leave a bitter taste in Spanish mouths|author=Giles Tremlett|work=the Guardian|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0717/27740-perejil/|title=Spain removes Moroccan troops from Perejil|date=17 July 2002|work=RTE.ie|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telquel-online.com/153/sujet3.shtml|title=Telquel-Online.com|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nMorocco claimed that the occupation was carried out in order to monitor illegal immigration, and to fight drug dealers and smugglers who use the island as a logistic platform.<ref>[http://www.elfaroceutamelilla.es/content/view/24521/69/ Consiguen el pase de 10 toneladas de droga almacenadas en isla Perejil.

Kazin says to begin to wonder about the tiger, and its nature, can only lead to a daring to wonder about it. Blake achieves great power through the use of [[alliteration]] (\"frame\" and \"fearful\") combined with [[imagery]] (burning, fire, eyes), and he structures the poem to ring with incessant repetitive questioning, demanding of the creature, \"Who made thee?\" In the third stanza the focus moves from the tiger, the creation, to the creator \u2013 of whom Blake wonders \"What dread hand? & what dread feet?\".<ref name = \"Kazin\"/> \"The Tyger\" is six stanzas in length, each stanza four lines long.  Much of the poem follows the metrical pattern of its first line and can be scanned as [[trochaic tetrameter]] [[catalectic]].  A number of lines, however, such as line four in the first stanza, fall into [[iambic tetrameter]].\n\n\"The Tyger\" lacks narrative movement. The first stanza opens the central question, \"What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\" Here the direct address to the creature becomes most obvious, but certainly, \"the Tyger\" cannot provide the lyrical \"I\" with a satisfactory answer, so the contemplation continues. \nThe second stanza questions \"the Tyger\" about where he was created; the third about how the creator formed him; the fourth about what tools were used. In the fifth stanza, Blake wonders how the creator reacted to \"the Tyger\", and who created the creature. \nFinally, the sixth restates the central question while raising the stakes; rather than merely question who or what \"could\" create the Tyger, the speaker wonders: ''who dares''.\n\n==Themes and critical analysis==\n\"The Tyger\" is the sister poem to \"[[The Lamb (poem)|The Lamb]]\" (from \"[[Songs of Innocence]]\"), a reflection of similar ideas from a different perspective (Blake's concept of \"contraries\"), with \"The Lamb\" bringing attention to innocence.  \"The Tyger\" presents a duality between aesthetic beauty and primal ferocity, and Blake believes that to see one, the hand that created \"The Lamb\", one must also see the other, the hand that created \"The Tyger\u201d: \"Did he who made the Lamb make thee?\" \n\nThe \"Songs of Experience\" were written as a contrary to the \"Songs of Innocence\" \u2013 a central tenet in Blake's philosophy, and central theme in his work.<ref name = \"Kazin\"/> The struggle of humanity is based on the concept of the contrary nature of things, Blake believed, and thus, to achieve truth one must see the contraries in innocence and experience. Experience is not the face of evil but rather another facet of that which created us. Kazin says of Blake, \"Never is he more heretical than ... where he glories in the hammer and fire out of which are struck ... the Tyger\".<ref name = \"Kazin\"/> Rather than believing in war between good and evil or heaven and hell, Blake thought each man must first see and then resolve the contraries of existence and life. In \"The Tyger\" he presents a poem of \"triumphant human awareness\" and \"a hymn to pure being\", according to Kazin.<ref name = \"Kazin\"/>\n\n==Musical versions==\nBlake's original tunes for his poems have been lost in time, but many artists have tried to create their own versions of the tunes. <ref>{{Citation|title=#3746: \"Songs of Experience\": Music Inspired by Poetry of William Blake {{!}} New Sounds - Hand-picked music, genre free|url=http://www.newsounds.org/story/songs-experience-music-inspired-poetry-william-blake/|language=en|accessdate=2017-12-07}}</ref> \n*[[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]] \u2013 \"The Tiger\" (1929\u201333)\n* [[Benjamin Britten]], in his [[song cycle]] ''[[Songs and Proverbs of William Blake]]'' (1965)\n*[[Marianne Faithfull]], in her song \"[http://www.mariannefaithfull.org.uk/music/dangerous-acquaintances/track/eye-communication/ Eye Communication]\" (1981) from the [[Dangerous Acquaintances]] album.\n* [[Duran Duran]] \u2013 \"Tiger Tiger\" (1983)\n* [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]], on the album \"[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience (Greg Brown album)|Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]\" (1986)\n* [[John Tavener]] \u2013 \"The Tyger\" (1987)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer?category=Works&workid=11185 |title=John Tavener |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=musicsalesclassical.com |publisher=Chester Music |access-date=August 2, 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n* [[Tangerine Dream]] \u2013 the album [[Tyger (album)|Tyger]] (1987)\n* [[Jah Wobble]] \u2013 \"Tyger Tyger\" (1996)\n* [[Kenneth Fuchs]] \u2013 ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience: Four Poems by William Blake for Baritone, Flute, Oboe, Cello, and Harp'' (completed 2006)\n* [[Herbst in Peking]] \u2013 \"The Tyger and The Fly\" (2014)\n* [[Qntal]] \u2013 \"Tyger\" (2014)\n* [[Mephisto Walz]] \u2013 \"The Tyger\"\n\n[[Bob Dylan]] also references Blake\u2019s poem in \u201cRoll on John\u201d (2012).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fearful Symmetry (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Quasar, Quasar, Burning Bright]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Gerald Eades Bentley|Bentley, G.

The illustrations are arranged differently in some copies, while a number of poems were moved from ''Songs of Innocence'' to ''Songs of Experience.''

Kazin says to begin to wonder about the tiger, and its nature, can only lead to a daring to wonder about it. Blake achieves great power through the use of [[alliteration]] (\"frame\" and \"fearful\") combined with [[imagery]] (burning, fire, eyes), and he structures the poem to ring with incessant repetitive questioning, demanding of the creature, \"Who made thee?\" In the third stanza the focus moves from the tiger, the creation, to the creator \u2013 of whom Blake wonders \"What dread hand? & what dread feet?\".<ref name = \"Kazin\"/> \"The Tyger\" is six stanzas in length, each stanza four lines long.  Much of the poem follows the metrical pattern of its first line and can be scanned as [[trochaic tetrameter]] [[catalectic]].  A number of lines, however, such as line four in the first stanza, fall into [[iambic tetrameter]].\n\n\"The Tyger\" lacks narrative movement. The first stanza opens the central question, \"What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\" Here the direct address to the creature becomes most obvious, but certainly, \"the Tyger\" cannot provide the lyrical \"I\" with a satisfactory answer, so the contemplation continues. \nThe second stanza questions \"the Tyger\" about where he was created; the third about how the creator formed him; the fourth about what tools were used. In the fifth stanza, Blake wonders how the creator reacted to \"the Tyger\", and who created the creature. \nFinally, the sixth restates the central question while raising the stakes; rather than merely question who or what \"could\" create the Tyger, the speaker wonders: ''who dares''.\n\n==Themes and critical analysis==\n\"The Tyger\" is the sister poem to \"[[The Lamb (poem)|The Lamb]]\" (from \"[[Songs of Innocence]]\"), a reflection of similar ideas from a different perspective (Blake's concept of \"contraries\"), with \"The Lamb\" bringing attention to innocence.  \"The Tyger\" presents a duality between aesthetic beauty and primal ferocity, and Blake believes that to see one, the hand that created \"The Lamb\", one must also see the other, the hand that created \"The Tyger\u201d: \"Did he who made the Lamb make thee?\" \n\nThe \"Songs of Experience\" were written as a contrary to the \"Songs of Innocence\" \u2013 a central tenet in Blake's philosophy, and central theme in his work.<ref name = \"Kazin\"/> The struggle of humanity is based on the concept of the contrary nature of things, Blake believed, and thus, to achieve truth one must see the contraries in innocence and experience. Experience is not the face of evil but rather another facet of that which created us. Kazin says of Blake, \"Never is he more heretical than ... where he glories in the hammer and fire out of which are struck ... the Tyger\".<ref name = \"Kazin\"/> Rather than believing in war between good and evil or heaven and hell, Blake thought each man must first see and then resolve the contraries of existence and life. In \"The Tyger\" he presents a poem of \"triumphant human awareness\" and \"a hymn to pure being\", according to Kazin.<ref name = \"Kazin\"/>\n\n==Musical versions==\nBlake's original tunes for his poems have been lost in time, but many artists have tried to create their own versions of the tunes. <ref>{{Citation|title=#3746: \"Songs of Experience\": Music Inspired by Poetry of William Blake {{!}} New Sounds - Hand-picked music, genre free|url=http://www.newsounds.org/story/songs-experience-music-inspired-poetry-william-blake/|language=en|accessdate=2017-12-07}}</ref> \n*[[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]] \u2013 \"The Tiger\" (1929\u201333)\n* [[Benjamin Britten]], in his [[song cycle]] ''[[Songs and Proverbs of William Blake]]'' (1965)\n*[[Marianne Faithfull]], in her song \"[http://www.mariannefaithfull.org.uk/music/dangerous-acquaintances/track/eye-communication/ Eye Communication]\" (1981) from the [[Dangerous Acquaintances]] album.\n* [[Duran Duran]] \u2013 \"Tiger Tiger\" (1983)\n* [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]], on the album \"[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience (Greg Brown album)|Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]\" (1986)\n* [[John Tavener]] \u2013 \"The Tyger\" (1987)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer?category=Works&workid=11185 |title=John Tavener |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=musicsalesclassical.com |publisher=Chester Music |access-date=August 2, 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n* [[Tangerine Dream]] \u2013 the album [[Tyger (album)|Tyger]] (1987)\n* [[Jah Wobble]] \u2013 \"Tyger Tyger\" (1996)\n* [[Kenneth Fuchs]] \u2013 ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience: Four Poems by William Blake for Baritone, Flute, Oboe, Cello, and Harp'' (completed 2006)\n* [[Herbst in Peking]] \u2013 \"The Tyger and The Fly\" (2014)\n* [[Qntal]] \u2013 \"Tyger\" (2014)\n* [[Mephisto Walz]] \u2013 \"The Tyger\"\n\n[[Bob Dylan]] also references Blake\u2019s poem in \u201cRoll on John\u201d (2012).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fearful Symmetry (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Quasar, Quasar, Burning Bright]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Gerald Eades Bentley|Bentley, G.
