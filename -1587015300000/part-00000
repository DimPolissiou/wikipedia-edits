In early October 2017, [[BuzzFeed News]] published leaked email chains from Yiannopoulos' tenure at Breitbart. According to the report, Yiannopoulos and his ghostwriter Allum Bokhari regularly solicited ideas for stories and comments from people associated with the [[alt-right]] and [[neo-Nazi]] movements. Among the figures Yiannopoulos contacted were [[Curtis Yarvin]], a central figure of the [[neoreactionary]] movement; [[Devin Saucier]], the editor of the white supremacist magazine ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]''; [[Andrew Auernheimer]], the administrator of neo-Nazi website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]''; and [[Baked Alaska (entertainer)|Baked Alaska]], a commentator known for his anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi tweets.<ref name=\"Bernstein\">{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Joseph|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism|title=Alt-White: How the Breitbart Machine laundered Racist Hate|work=[[BuzzFeed News]]|date=5 October 2017|accessdate=6 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe story also reported that Yiannopoulos had a penchant for using personal passwords with [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] overtones, such as 'Kristall', a reference to [[Kristallnacht]] and 'longknives1290', a compound reference to the [[Night of the Long Knives]] and the [[Edict of Expulsion]].<ref name=\"Bernstein\"/>\n\nIn a Breitbart article, Yiannopoulos and a co-author described the alt-right movement as \"dangerously bright\". The ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'' stated that many of these intellectual backers write for publications it describes as racist and antisemitic, such as [[VDARE]] and ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]''. The Breitbart article was criticised by opponents of the alt-right for excusing the extremist elements of the movement, and also by the neo-Nazi website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'' which holds that racism and antisemitism are pillars of the alt-right.<ref>\n*{{cite news|last1=Kirchick|first1=James|title=The Sad Story of Milo Yiannopoulos: the Trump Troll With Daddy Issues|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/203888/donald-trumps-little-boy|work=Tablet Magazine|date=1 June 2016}}\n*{{cite news|last1=Hankes|first1=Keegan|title=Whose Alt-Right Is It Anyway?|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/08/25/whose-alt-right-it-anyway|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=25 August 2016}}</ref> Milo has also stated that \u201cWhite pride, white nationalism, white supremacy isn\u2019t the way to go ...

Shapiro accused Yiannopoulos, his followers, and other Trump supporters of racist and anti-Semitic behaviour.

According to the bartender who was working on the night of the incident, Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and their entourage came into the bar and asked to sing karaoke even though it had ended. When the bartender saw the Nazi salutes she rushed the stage and told Yiannopoulos and his friends to leave, at which point they began harassing her, chanting \"Trump! Trump!

He used his own experience as an example, saying he was mature enough to be capable of giving consent at a young age. He also stated that \"[[paedophilia]] is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old, who is sexually mature\" but rather that \"paedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty.\" Later in the interview, after his previous comments received some pushback from the hosts, he stated: \"I think the [[age of consent]] law is probably about right, that is probably roughly the right age ... but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them.\"<ref>Paedophilia remarks:\n*{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/02/21/the-96-hours-that-brought-down-milo-yiannopoulos|title=The 96 hours that brought down Milo Yiannopoulos|first1=Abby|last1=Ohlheiser|first2=Abby|last2=Ohlheiser|date=21 February 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]}} \n*{{Cite news|url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/cpac-milo-yiannopoulos-pedophilia.html|title=CPAC Blasted for Milo Yiannopoulos Invite After Pedophilia Remarks Resurface|last=Hartmann|first=Margaret |work=New York|access-date=21 February 2017}}\n*{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/milo-yiannopoulos-resigns-from-breitbart-news/2017/02/21/0217c128-f7cc-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html|title=Breitbart's Milo Yiannopoulos resigns following outrage over his past comments about pedophilia|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=20 February 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=29 August 2017|issn=0190-8286|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221221043/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/milo-yiannopoulos-resigns-from-breitbart-news/2017/02/21/0217c128-f7cc-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html|archivedate=21 February 2017}}\n*{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=German|title=Meet the 16-year-old Canadian girl who took down Milo Yiannopoulos|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/24/14715774/milo-yiannopoulos-cpac-pedophile-video-canada|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=Vox|date=24 February 2017|quote=But it started when a 16-year-old high school student in Canada decided Yiannopoulos was embraced much too closely by mainstream conservatives.

Palgrave Macmillan, Cham, {{ISBN|978-3-030-12632-2}}</ref>\n\n==== Association with neo-Nazism and the alt-right ====\nMuch of the work at Breitbart which brought Yiannopoulos to national attention was inspired by the ideas of neo-Nazis and white nationalists. In early October 2017, [[BuzzFeed News]] published leaked email chains from Yiannopoulos' tenure at Breitbart. According to the report, Yiannopoulos and his ghostwriter Allum Bokhari regularly solicited ideas for stories and comments from people associated with the [[alt-right]] and [[neo-Nazi]] movements. Among the figures Yiannopoulos contacted were [[Curtis Yarvin]], a central figure of the [[neoreactionary]] movement; [[Devin Saucier]], the editor of the white supremacist magazine ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]''; [[Andrew Auernheimer]], the administrator of neo-Nazi website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]''; and [[Baked Alaska (entertainer)|Baked Alaska]], a commentator known for his anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi tweets.<ref name=\"Bernstein\">{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Joseph|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism|title=Alt-White: How the Breitbart Machine laundered Racist Hate|work=[[BuzzFeed News]]|date=5 October 2017|accessdate=6 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe story also reported that Yiannopoulos had a penchant for using personal passwords with [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] overtones, such as 'Kristall', a reference to [[Kristallnacht]] and 'longknives1290', a compound reference to the [[Night of the Long Knives]] and the [[Edict of Expulsion]].<ref name=\"Bernstein\"/>\n\nIn a Breitbart article, Yiannopoulos and a co-author described the alt-right movement as \"dangerously bright\". The ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'' stated that many of these intellectual backers write for publications it describes as racist and antisemitic, such as [[VDARE]] and ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]''. The Breitbart article was criticised by opponents of the alt-right for excusing the extremist elements of the movement, and also by the neo-Nazi website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'' which holds that racism and antisemitism are pillars of the alt-right.<ref>\n*{{cite news|last1=Kirchick|first1=James|title=The Sad Story of Milo Yiannopoulos: the Trump Troll With Daddy Issues|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/203888/donald-trumps-little-boy|work=Tablet Magazine|date=1 June 2016}}\n*{{cite news|last1=Hankes|first1=Keegan|title=Whose Alt-Right Is It Anyway?|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/08/25/whose-alt-right-it-anyway|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=25 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Anti-Defamation League]] classifies Yiannopoulos as part of the [[alt-lite]]; a term used to distinguish individuals sometimes associated with the alt-right from those who are openly [[white nationalist]] and [[anti-semitic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=From Alt Right to Alt Lite: Naming the Hate|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/from-alt-right-to-alt-lite-naming-the-hate|website=adl.org|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=9 August 2017}}</ref> These accusations, as well as Yiannopoulos's support for Trump, have contributed to a feud between Yiannopoulos and [[Ben Shapiro]], a Jewish conservative political commentator who refused to support Trump in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. Shapiro accused Yiannopoulos, his followers, and other Trump supporters of racist and anti-Semitic behaviour. He criticized Yiannopoulos's attempts to distinguish between real racist or bigoted behaviour and trolling, stating that \"words have meaning\" and that the distinction that Yiannopoulos was attempting to make \"simply doesn\u2019t exist in objective reality\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/05/ben-shapiros-messy-breakup-with-breitbart.html |title=Explaining Ben Shapiro's Messy, Ethnic-Slur-Laden Breakup With Breitbart |last=Singal |first=Jesse |date=26 May 2016 |publisher=The Intelligencer |access-date=2 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nin 2017, Yiannopoulos was caught on camera singing \"[[America the Beautiful]]\" at a [[karaoke]] bar, where a crowd of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, including [[Richard B.

Primary star masses range from 0.69 to 1.53 [[solar mass]]es ([[Kepler-16]] A & [[PH1]] Aa), star mass ratios from 1.03 to 3.76 ([[Kepler-34]] & [[PH1]]), and binary eccentricity from 0.023 to 0.521 ([[Kepler-47]] & [[Kepler-34]]). The distribution of planet eccentricities, range from nearly circular e=0.007 to a significant e=0.182 ([[Kepler-16]] & [[Kepler-34]]).

The innermost planets in all the Kepler circumbinary systems have been found orbiting close to this radius. The planets have [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] that lie between 1.09 and 1.46 times this critical radius. The reason could be that [[planetary migration|migration]] might become inefficient near the critical radius, leaving planets just outside this radius.<ref name=\"WelshOroszCarterFabrycky\"/>\n\nRecently, it has been found that the distribution of the innermost planetary semi-major axes is consistent with a log-uniform distribution, taking into account the selection biases, where closer-in planets can be detected more easily.<ref name=\":8\" /> This questions the pile-up of planets near the stability limit as well as the dominance of planet migration.\n\n===Absence of planets around shorter period binaries===\n\nMost Kepler eclipsing binaries have periods less than 1 day but the shortest period of a Kepler eclipsing binary hosting a planet is 7.4 days ([[Kepler-47]]). The short-period binaries are unlikely to have formed in such a tight orbit and their lack of planets may be related to the mechanism that removed [[angular momentum]] allowing the stars to orbit so closely.<ref name=\"WelshOroszCarterFabrycky\"/> One exception is the planet around an X-ray binary MXB_1658-298, which has an orbital period of 7.1 hrs.\n\n===Planet size limit===\nAs of June 2016, all but one of the confirmed Kepler circumbinary planets are smaller than Jupiter. This cannot be a selection effect because larger planets are easier to detect.<ref name=\"WelshOroszCarterFabrycky\"/> Simulations had predicted this would be the case.<ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2000 On the formation and migration of giant planets in circumbinary discs], Arnaud Pierens, Richard P.

None of them are [[terrestrial planet]]s, but large [[moons]] of such planets could be habitable. Because of the stellar binarity, the insolation received by the planet will likely be time-varying in a way quite unlike the regular sunlight Earth receives.<ref name=\"WelshOroszCarterFabrycky\"/>\n\n'''<big>Transit Probability</big>'''\n\nCircumbinary planets are generally more likely to transit than planets around a single star.

The Model 1795 was used in the [[War of 1812]], after which shortcomings in both the design and [[manufacturing process]] of the Model 1795 led to the development of the [[Model 1812 Musket]] at Springfield only, and eventually the [[Model 1816 Musket]] muskets at both armories.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Model 1795, a very elongated musket, retained many of the characteristics of the Charleville on which it was based. It had a {{convert|44|in|cm}} long .69 [[caliber]] barrel, a {{convert|56|in|cm}} [[Stock (firearms)|stock]], and a total length of {{convert|60|in|cm}}. The original version had the [[bayonet lug]] on the bottom of the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] but this was later moved to the top. Minor changes were made throughout production inclusive of a shorter barrel length of {{convert|42|in|cm}} on the later Harper's Ferry weapons. Barrels of Harper's Ferry 1795s were serial numbered up to some point in 1812: Springfield Model 1795's were never serial numbered. Springfield began the Model 1812 improvements in 1814, but Harper's Ferry continued on with the production of the Model 1795 until at least 1819 (early 1819 examples still used the M1795 lockplate) and never produced the Model 1812. Eventually, both armories incorporated improvements into the Model 1816 flintlock which were after a few years virtually identical. Most, but not all, parts will [[Interchangeable parts|interchange]] on the Model 1816 muskets but the hand-crafted parts, and lack of [[Standard operating procedure|set standards]] and [[Procedure (business)|patterns]] on the earlier Model 1795 weapons often means parts will not interchange easily.\n\nTypical of [[smoothbore]] muskets, the M1795 had an effective range of about {{convert|50|yd|m}} to {{convert|75|yd|m}}. The Model 1795 fired a smaller [[Round shot|round]] than the British .75 caliber [[Brown Bess]], but the Model 1795 also had both a slightly longer range and slightly better [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] than the Brown Bess musket. This gave the [[United States Armed Forces|American forces]] an advantage of range when they faced [[Armed Forces of the Crown|British forces]] in the War of 1812.<ref>\"Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law\", by Gregg Lee Carter, Published by ABC-CLIO, 2002</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe Model 1795 was [[American system of manufacturing|manufactured]] at the [[Springfield Armory|United States Armory and Arsenal at Springfield]], which was the first [[Arsenal|armory]] in the United States, at least as early as 1799. Earlier versions prior to this date probably were produced but were not dated. Starting in 1801, possibly as early as 1800, it was also produced in the then new [[Harper's Ferry Armory|United States Armory and Arsenal at Harper's Ferry]].\n[[image:1795 Musket.jpg|thumb|right|400px|A modern reproduction of the Springfield Model 1795 Musket]]\nSeveral differences between the Springfield Model 1795 and the Harper's Ferry Model 1795 have led many to label the Harper's Ferry version as a significantly different model. Quite a few independent [[Defense contractor|contractor]]s also made the weapon as they were in constant [[demand]]. The federal armories simply could not make enough muskets to meet demand with the labor force they had during these early years. Only about two dozen [[artisans]] worked in the Harpers Ferry arsenal around 1800, and making the muskets from raw materials was a very labor-intensive task. Approximately 80,000 Springfield Model 1795 muskets were produced while about 70,000 were produced at Harper's Ferry.<ref>Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms, 2001</ref>\n\n==Service history==\nModel 1795s were used throughout the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican\u2013War]] of 1846\u201348, and the [[American Civil War]] of 1861\u201365. Most were converted to [[percussion cap]]s either at the armories or by private individuals, but records reflect that many in the South were issued an original flintlock at the beginning of the Civil War until the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] could convert them to [[Caplock mechanism|percussion]]. There is some evidence that some were in fact never converted at all from flintlock. The effective service life of the Model 1795 thus extends through 1865.\n\nThe Model 1795 was also used by some members of the [[Corps of Discovery Expedition|Lewis and Clark]] expedition.<ref>\"Lewis & Clark Tailor Made, Trail Worn: Army Life, Clothing & Weapons of the Corps of Discovery\", by Robert John Moore, Robert J.
