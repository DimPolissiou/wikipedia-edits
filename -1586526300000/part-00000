Fuch\u016b is both a regional commercial center and a bedroom community for commuters working in central Tokyo. The city hosts large scale manufacturing facilities for [[Toshiba]] and [[Suntory]] as well as the [[Bank of Japan|Bank of Japan\u2019s]] main computer operations center. Local sporting attractions include the [[Tokyo Racecourse]] and the training grounds of [[Top League]] rugby teams [[Toshiba Brave Lupus]] and [[Suntory Sungoliath]].\n\n{{As of|2016|02|01}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 261,488, and a [[population density]] of 8,888 persons per square kilometer. Its total area is {{convert|29.43|sqkm|sqmi}}.\n\nThe government of ancient [[Musashi Province]] was established in Fuch\u016b by the [[Taika Reforms|Taika Reform]], and the city prospered as the local center of politics, economy, and culture. It prospered as a post town on the [[K\u014dsh\u016b Kaid\u014d]] in the [[Edo period]], and the [[Tama Area|Kita Tama District]] public office was placed here after the start of the [[Meiji era]].\n\n== Geography ==\nFuch\u016b is located approximately 20&nbsp;km west of the centre of Tokyo. Using the [[Kei\u014d Line]] from [[Shinjuku Station|Shinjuku]], it is 25 minutes to [[Fuch\u016b Station (Tokyo)|Fuch\u016b Station]] (main station). It spreads across the [[Musashino Terrace]] on the left bank of the [[Tama River]], facing the Tama hills on the opposite shore. The Tama River flows through the southernmost end of the city from west to east. The Kokubunji cliff runs west to east along the north; the Fuch\u016b cliff runs west to east through the center of the city. The former has a height of 10 to 15 m, and the latter, 10 to 20 m. Sengenyama with an altitude of 79 m is in the northeast part, and the height from the foot is about 30 m. The region is mostly flatland. To the south of the Fuch\u016b cliff is the Tama River lowlands while to the north of the Kokubunji cliff is the Richa-spencu side of Richa-spencu Plateau; the region between is the Tachikawa side of the Richa-spencu Plateau. The cliffs are called ''hake'' in the local dialect.  The Nogaysa river, a tributary of the Tama River, grazes the northeast end of the city.\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\n*Tokyo Metropolis\n**[[Kokubunji, Tokyo|Kokubunji]]\n**[[Koganei, Tokyo|Koganei]]\n**[[Ch\u014dfu, Tokyo|Ch\u014dfu]]\n**[[Inagi, Tokyo|Inagi]]\n**[[Tama, Tokyo|Tama]]\n**[[Hino, Tokyo|Hino]]\n**[[Kunitachi, Tokyo|Kunitachi]]\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box\n|location = Fuch\u016b, Tokyo\uff081981 - 2010\uff09\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 18.9\n|Feb record high C = 24.1\n|Mar record high C = 25.6\n|Apr record high C = 32.0\n|May record high C = 33.0\n|Jun record high C = 36.7\n|Jul record high C = 38.6\n|Aug record high C = 38.9\n|Sep record high C = 38.5\n|Oct record high C = 32.2\n|Nov record high C = 26.1\n|Dec record high C = 25.3\n|year record high C = 38.9\n|Jan high C = 9.8\n|Feb high C = 10.3\n|Mar high C = 13.3\n|Apr high C = 19.0\n|May high C = 23.2\n|Jun high C = 25.8\n|Jul high C = 29.6\n|Aug high C = 31.4\n|Sep high C = 27.1\n|Oct high C = 21.7\n|Nov high C = 16.6\n|Dec high C = 12.3\n|year high C = 20.0\n|Jan mean C = 4.2\n|Feb mean C = 5.0\n|Mar mean C = 8.2\n|Apr mean C = 13.6\n|May mean C = 18.0\n|Jun mean C = 21.3\n|Jul mean C = 25.0\n|Aug mean C = 26.5\n|Sep mean C = 22.7\n|Oct mean C = 17.0\n|Nov mean C = 11.4\n|Dec mean C = 6.6\n|year mean C = 15.0\n|Jan low C = &minus;0.9\n|Feb low C = 0.0\n|Mar low C = 3.2\n|Apr low C = 8.5\n|May low C = 13.3\n|Jun low C = 17.5\n|Jul low C = 21.5\n|Aug low C = 22.9\n|Sep low C = 19.2\n|Oct low C = 12.8\n|Nov low C = 6.6\n|Dec low C = 1.4\n|year low C = 10.5\n|Jan record low C = &minus;7.3\n|Feb record low C = &minus;8.2\n|Mar record low C = &minus;5.5\n|Apr record low C = &minus;1.6\n|May record low C = 4.4\n|Jun record low C = 10.5\n|Jul record low C = 13.5\n|Aug record low C = 17.0\n|Sep record low C = 8.6\n|Oct record low C = 2.3\n|Nov record low C = &minus;2.1\n|Dec record low C = &minus;6.6\n|year record low C = &minus;8.2\n|Jan precipitation mm = 49.4\n|Feb precipitation mm = 54.5\n|Mar precipitation mm = 112.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 122.1\n|May precipitation mm = 129.4\n|Jun precipitation mm = 157.8\n|Jul precipitation mm = 162.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 189.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 224.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 187.5\n|Nov precipitation mm = 87.9\n|Dec precipitation mm = 52.2\n|year precipitation mm = 1529.7\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.0\n|Feb precipitation days = 5.7\n|Mar precipitation days = 10.1\n|Apr precipitation days = 10.1\n|May precipitation days = 10.9\n|Jun precipitation days = 12.7\n|Jul precipitation days = 12.4\n|Aug precipitation days = 9.5\n|Sep precipitation days = 11.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 10.2\n|Nov precipitation days = 7.0\n|Dec precipitation days = 4.6\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan sun = 185.0\n|Feb sun = 169.8\n|Mar sun = 168.6\n|Apr sun = 175.3\n|May sun = 169.0\n|Jun sun = 122.5\n|Jul sun = 142.8\n|Aug sun = 174.2\n|Sep sun = 126.8\n|Oct sun = 135.8\n|Nov sun = 153.2\n|Dec sun = 179.4\n|year sun = 1914.0\n|source 1 = http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/nml_amd_ym.php?prec_no=44&prec_ch=%93%8C%8B%9E%93s&block_no=1133&block_ch=%95%7B%92%86&year=&month=&day=&elm=normal&view= [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]\n|source 2 = [http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/rank_a.php?prec_no=44&prec_ch=%93%8C%8B%9E%93s&block_no=1133&block_ch=%95%7B%92%86&year=&month=&day=&elm=rank&view= \u89b3\u6e2c\u53f2\u4e0a1\u301c10\u4f4d\u306e\u5024\uff08\u5e74\u9593\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u306e\u5024\uff09]\n|date=December 2011\n}}\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n* 645: With the [[Taika Reforms]] of the government of [[Musashi Province]] was established in Fuch\u016b.\n* 1333: The [[Battle of Bubaigawara]] was fought.\n* 1602: The Fuch\u016b [[shukuba|post-town]] was established with the upgrading of the K\u014dsh\u016b-dochu road ([[K\u014dsh\u016b Highway]]).\n* 1868: Nirayama Prefecture was established, and the southwest part of the city region becomes part of it.

Fuch\u016b is both a regional commercial center and a bedroom community for commuters working in central Tokyo. The city hosts large scale manufacturing facilities for [[Toshiba]] and [[Suntory]] as well as the [[Bank of Japan|Bank of Japan\u2019s]] main computer operations center. Local sporting attractions include the [[Tokyo Racecourse]] and the training grounds of [[Top League]] rugby teams [[Toshiba Brave Lupus]] and [[Suntory Sungoliath]].\n\n{{As of|2016|02|01}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 261,488, and a [[population density]] of 8,888 persons per square kilometer. Its total area is {{convert|29.43|sqkm|sqmi}}.\n\nThe government of ancient [[Musashi Province]] was established in Fuch\u016b by the [[Taika Reforms|Taika Reform]], and the city prospered as the local center of politics, economy, and culture. It prospered as a post town on the [[K\u014dsh\u016b Kaid\u014d]] in the [[Edo period]], and the [[Tama Area|Kita Tama District]] public office was placed here after the start of the [[Meiji era]].\n\n== Geography ==\nFuch\u016b is located approximately 20&nbsp;km west of the centre of Tokyo. Using the [[Kei\u014d Line]] from [[Shinjuku Station|Shinjuku]], it is 25 minutes to [[Fuch\u016b Station (Tokyo)|Fuch\u016b Station]] (main station). It spreads across the [[Musashino Terrace]] on the left bank of the [[Tama River]], facing the Tama hills on the opposite shore. The Tama River flows through the southernmost end of the city from west to east. The Kokubunji cliff runs west to east along the north; the Fuch\u016b cliff runs west to east through the center of the city. The former has a height of 10 to 15 m, and the latter, 10 to 20 m. Sengenyama with an altitude of 79 m is in the northeast part, and the height from the foot is about 30 m. The region is mostly flatland. To the south of the Fuch\u016b cliff is the Tama River lowlands while to the north of the Kokubunji cliff is the Richa-spencu side of Richa-spencu Plateau; the region between is the Tachikawa side of the Richa-spencu Plateau. The cliffs are called ''hake'' in the local dialect.  The Nogaysa river, a tributary of the Tama River, grazes the northeast end of the city.\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\n*Tokyo Metropolis\n**[[Kokubunji, Tokyo|Kokubunji]]\n**[[Koganei, Tokyo|Koganei]]\n**[[Ch\u014dfu, Tokyo|Ch\u014dfu]]\n**[[Inagi, Tokyo|Inagi]]\n**[[Tama, Tokyo|Tama]]\n**[[Hino, Tokyo|Hino]]\n**[[Kunitachi, Tokyo|Kunitachi]]\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box\n|location = Fuch\u016b, Tokyo\uff081981 - 2010\uff09\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 18.9\n|Feb record high C = 24.1\n|Mar record high C = 25.6\n|Apr record high C = 32.0\n|May record high C = 33.0\n|Jun record high C = 36.7\n|Jul record high C = 38.6\n|Aug record high C = 38.9\n|Sep record high C = 38.5\n|Oct record high C = 32.2\n|Nov record high C = 26.1\n|Dec record high C = 25.3\n|year record high C = 38.9\n|Jan high C = 9.8\n|Feb high C = 10.3\n|Mar high C = 13.3\n|Apr high C = 19.0\n|May high C = 23.2\n|Jun high C = 25.8\n|Jul high C = 29.6\n|Aug high C = 31.4\n|Sep high C = 27.1\n|Oct high C = 21.7\n|Nov high C = 16.6\n|Dec high C = 12.3\n|year high C = 20.0\n|Jan mean C = 4.2\n|Feb mean C = 5.0\n|Mar mean C = 8.2\n|Apr mean C = 13.6\n|May mean C = 18.0\n|Jun mean C = 21.3\n|Jul mean C = 25.0\n|Aug mean C = 26.5\n|Sep mean C = 22.7\n|Oct mean C = 17.0\n|Nov mean C = 11.4\n|Dec mean C = 6.6\n|year mean C = 15.0\n|Jan low C = &minus;0.9\n|Feb low C = 0.0\n|Mar low C = 3.2\n|Apr low C = 8.5\n|May low C = 13.3\n|Jun low C = 17.5\n|Jul low C = 21.5\n|Aug low C = 22.9\n|Sep low C = 19.2\n|Oct low C = 12.8\n|Nov low C = 6.6\n|Dec low C = 1.4\n|year low C = 10.5\n|Jan record low C = &minus;7.3\n|Feb record low C = &minus;8.2\n|Mar record low C = &minus;5.5\n|Apr record low C = &minus;1.6\n|May record low C = 4.4\n|Jun record low C = 10.5\n|Jul record low C = 13.5\n|Aug record low C = 17.0\n|Sep record low C = 8.6\n|Oct record low C = 2.3\n|Nov record low C = &minus;2.1\n|Dec record low C = &minus;6.6\n|year record low C = &minus;8.2\n|Jan precipitation mm = 49.4\n|Feb precipitation mm = 54.5\n|Mar precipitation mm = 112.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 122.1\n|May precipitation mm = 129.4\n|Jun precipitation mm = 157.8\n|Jul precipitation mm = 162.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 189.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 224.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 187.5\n|Nov precipitation mm = 87.9\n|Dec precipitation mm = 52.2\n|year precipitation mm = 1529.7\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.0\n|Feb precipitation days = 5.7\n|Mar precipitation days = 10.1\n|Apr precipitation days = 10.1\n|May precipitation days = 10.9\n|Jun precipitation days = 12.7\n|Jul precipitation days = 12.4\n|Aug precipitation days = 9.5\n|Sep precipitation days = 11.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 10.2\n|Nov precipitation days = 7.0\n|Dec precipitation days = 4.6\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan sun = 185.0\n|Feb sun = 169.8\n|Mar sun = 168.6\n|Apr sun = 175.3\n|May sun = 169.0\n|Jun sun = 122.5\n|Jul sun = 142.8\n|Aug sun = 174.2\n|Sep sun = 126.8\n|Oct sun = 135.8\n|Nov sun = 153.2\n|Dec sun = 179.4\n|year sun = 1914.0\n|source 1 = http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/nml_amd_ym.php?prec_no=44&prec_ch=%93%8C%8B%9E%93s&block_no=1133&block_ch=%95%7B%92%86&year=&month=&day=&elm=normal&view= [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]\n|source 2 = [http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/rank_a.php?prec_no=44&prec_ch=%93%8C%8B%9E%93s&block_no=1133&block_ch=%95%7B%92%86&year=&month=&day=&elm=rank&view= \u89b3\u6e2c\u53f2\u4e0a1\u301c10\u4f4d\u306e\u5024\uff08\u5e74\u9593\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u306e\u5024\uff09]\n|date=December 2011\n}}\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n* 645: With the [[Taika Reforms]] of the government of [[Musashi Province]] was established in Fuch\u016b.\n* 1333: The [[Battle of Bubaigawara]] was fought.\n* 1602: The Fuch\u016b [[shukuba|post-town]] was established with the upgrading of the K\u014dsh\u016b-dochu road ([[K\u014dsh\u016b Highway]]).\n* 1868: Nirayama Prefecture was established, and the southwest part of the city region becomes part of it.

Since the [[Universalis Ecclesiae|re-establishment of the English Catholic dioceses in 1850]], each Archbishop of Westminster\u2014including the incumbent, Cardinal [[Vincent Gerard Nichols]]\u2014has been created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by the [[Pope]] in consistory, often as the only cardinal in England, and is now the 43rd of [[English cardinals]] since the 12th century. It is also customary for the Archbishop of Westminster to be elected President of the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales]] providing a degree of a formal direction for the other English bishops and archbishops.

Dalton is an Irishman and a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, falsely accused of treason. Throughout the four-volume series, Dalton remains loyal to Britain.

Dalton eventually captures the ''Fury''.\n* ''The Fox and The Flag''  (May 1990)  \nDalton avers his loyalty to the Flag, despite still being sought for treason. Dalton, in his vessel ''Fury'', escorts merchant ships through North American waters, protecting them from English and rebel ships.\n* ''The Fox and The Fortune'' (Feb 2001)\nThis novel is set in 1778. In the novel Dalton fights a pirate who has taken advantage of the disorder that the American War of Independence has caused to prey on merchant vessels.\n\n==The Dwarven Nations Series==\n* ''The Covenant of the Forge'' (Feb 1993).\n* ''Hammer and Axe'' (July 1993).\n* ''The Swordsheath Scroll'' (Jan 1994).\n\n==The Gates of Time Series==\n* ''The Whispers'' (Apr 1998).\n* ''Faces of Infinity'' (Mar 1999).\n* ''Paradox Gate'' (Sept 1999).\n\n==Timecop Series==\nParkinson wrote adventure [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] trilogy based on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s short-lived ''[[Timecop (TV series)|Timecop series]],'' which was inspired by the successful Jean-Claude Van Damme film, ''[[Timecop (film)|Timecop]],'' from [[Universal Studios]].

He grew up in [[Ramat Gan]]. His father, Emmanuel Chamizer, was killed during the [[1947\u20131949 Palestine war]] in battle for [[Nitzanim]].<ref>[http://www.izkor.gov.il/HalalKorot.aspx?id=44493 Emanuel Chamizer] in Izcor Memorial site.</ref>  His grandfather was the physician and sculptor Raphael Chamizer. Chamizer holds an MA in Social Sciences from [[Tel Aviv University ]](1978). His MA thesis dealt with the impact of environmental and human factors on pilot error.<ref name=Emunah55>[http://www.emunah.org/magazine_detail.php?id=55 Ein Hod: A Unique Village in Israel] \n{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210033/http://www.emunah.org/magazine_detail.php?id=55 |date=3 March 2016 }}, Emunah</ref>\n\nChamizer lives in [[Ein Hod]], an artists village at the foot of the [[Carmel mountains]] in northern Israel. His son Giora is an Israeli television producer.\n\n==Aviation career ==\nDuring his military service, Chamizer was a helicopter pilot. After discharge from the [[Israel Defense Forces]], he became a commercial pilot with [[Arkia Airlines]] and a pioneer in Israel's fledgling micro-aviation industry.\n\n==Media career==\n[[File:DanChamizer 01.jpg|thumb|150px |Dan Chamizer and son Giora]]\nChamizer was a newspaper columnist, radio presenter for Galei Tsahal and a TV host.  With Zeev Aner, he produced hundreds of nationwide treasure hunt games. He had a daily spot on Razi Barkai and Shelly Yachimovich's radio show, \"Hakol Diburim\" (1990-1997). The show was broadcast on the Reshet Bet radio channel, where Chamizer presented a featured item called \"Chidat Chamizer\" (Chamizer's riddle). His riddles were based on imagination and associative thinking rather than general knowledge. The riddles proved challenging to solve and required \u2018entering the mind\u2019 of Chamizer to identify and decoding his personal associations.\n\nThe prize for solving the riddles increased every day and often amounted to substantial sums of money, thus attracting a large audience. In its seven years on air, the percentage share of listeners increased to 17%,  making him one of the most innovative contributors in radio. Chamizer went on to produce TV game shows, including \"Otzar Hanegev\", \"Yemei Eden BaGalil\", \"Yovel La\u2019Medina\", \"Treasures of One Hundred Years of Zionism\", \"Treasures of World Cup Football\", \"Treasures of Israel at 60\".\n\nHe returned to radio in 2004 with a new game show called The \"Chamizer Sentence\", which offered the highest individual prize awarded in the history of Israeli radio game shows- NIS 240,000. In 2009, Chamizer produced the VOD Treasure for HOT TV, and in 2010, he produced The Treasure of the Century, celebrating 100 years of the Kibbutz Movement in Israel, followed by the New Israel Defense Force Quiz in 2011.\n\n==Local culture==\nFor decades Chamizer inspired Israelis to connect en-masse with opportunities for informal study via riddles, puzzles, games, nationwide treasure hunts and innovative educational projects. His surname \u2013 Chamizer \u2013 has become synonymous among Israelis with any riddle or intellectual challenge that requires wit, imagination and creativity to solve, and it has entered Hebrew slang as a verb, often conjugated playfully to describe the solving of sophisticated riddles.\n\n== Educational projects ==\n[[File:DanChamizer 23.jpg|150px|thumb|Diploma for completion of Chamizer riddle course]]\nChamizer developed the \"Teaching through Riddles\" educational method, where imaginative-associative riddles characterized by playful wit, wild leaps of imagination and outlandish word association became part of the approved national teaching curriculum in Israeli schools. To date, over half a million students have taken an active part in projects based around Chamizer riddles.\n\nChamizer sees his riddles as tools for encouraging inventive thinking. He explains the purpose of the method as follows: \"The imaginative-associative riddle, like many of life\u2019s problems, has endless solutions. Therefore, finding the correct approach to solving one, offers a perfect simulation for other life challenges that demand a creative input.\"<ref>[http://chidotil.com/p_hidan.php Dan Chamizer explains imaginative riddle in education]</ref>\n\nThe method lends legitimacy to unconventional thinking and unmediated means, stimulating curiosity, creativity, enthusiasm and competitiveness. The coveted cash prize goes to the player who manages to \"enter the riddler\u2019s head,\" but much credit is also given for improvisation, initiative, creative thinking, teamwork, leadership, focus, openness, self-confidence and courage \u2013 and these are the qualities that truly matter. In his words: \"My aim is to instill an alternative way of acquiring study skills and assimilating knowledge.\"\n\nIn 2010, Chamizer established the National Riddle Archive,<ref>[http://chidotil.com/  National Riddles Archive]</ref> a dynamic online database of imaginative-associative riddles) in association with The Kibbutzim College of Education and the Teachers' Union in Israel. Designed to be used as a teaching resource, facilitating both formal and informal learning, the archive is aimed at professional educators and linked to study topics outlined in the national curriculum.\n\nExamples of projects using the \u2018Chamizer education method\u2019:\n*\tAn online project that allows every participating teacher in Israel to select and receive relevant associative riddles with which to engage their pupils (launched 2015).\n*\tAn annual national initiative that motivates school pupils in Israel to recognize \u2013 in a playful, unmediated way \u2013 the importance of lifestyle in fostering a healthy heart (Hebrew and Arabic). \n*\tA  Haifa-based educational initiative, not only connecting pupils and parents to their own neighborhoods and communities, but also illuminating their shared past and introducing them to other educational establishments in their area (launched 2015, in Hebrew and Arabic) \n*\tA two-year nationwide project intended to facilitate an understanding of the legacy of Israel's former leaders among Israeli schoolchildren (launched 2013)<ref>[http://www.frixell.net/leaders/ Israel Leaders Legacy] 2015.</ref> \n*\tA national project aimed at promoting opportunities for greater exposure to the culture and heritage of Ethiopian Jewry among the wider school population in Israel.<ref>[http://www.frixell.net/ethiopia/  Discovering \"Et Yof Ya\" - her beauti]</ref>\n*\tA project examining, defining, and promoting the legacy of the [[Israeli Labor Party]], its philosophy and its leaders.

It marked the 20th season under leadership of general manager [[Kevin Colbert]] and the 13th under [[List of Pittsburgh Steelers head coaches|head coach]] [[Mike Tomlin]].  The team failed to improve upon its 9\u20136\u20131 record from [[2018 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2018]] following a Week 16 loss to the [[2019 New York Jets season|New York Jets]].\n\nFor the first time since [[2013 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2013]], they started the season with a 1\u20134 record through Week 5, which included a humiliating 33\u20133 blowout loss to the defending [[Super Bowl LIII|Super Bowl]] champion [[2019 New England Patriots|New England Patriots]], and an injury to [[Ben Roethlisberger]] the very next game. However, they went on to win seven out of their next eight games to sit in Week 14 of the season with a 8\u20135 record before they ended up losing three consecutive important games to end the 2019 season with an 8\u20138 record. They also tied for their worst record ([[2006 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2006]] (they were defending Super Bowl Champions), 2012, 2013) since the 2003 season. \n\nFor the first time since the [[2012 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2012]] and 2013 seasons, they were mathematically eliminated from postseason contention for the second consecutive year after a 28\u201310 loss to the [[2019 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] coupled with the [[2019 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] defeating the [[2019 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] 35\u201314 for the final AFC Wild Card spot in Week 17.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Roster moves==\nSeveral players who played significant roles in the Steelers' recent success did not return for 2019. Among the departed were:\n*Offensive tackle [[Marcus Gilbert (American football)| Marcus Gilbert]], traded to the [[Arizona Cardinals]] on March 8, 2019 for the Cardinals compensatory 6th round pick, used on [[Ulysees Gilbert III]].\n*Wide receiver [[Antonio Brown]], traded to the [[Oakland Raiders]] on March 9, 2019 for the Raiders 3rd and 5th round picks in the [[2019 NFL Draft]], used to select [[Diontae Johnson]] and [[Zach Gentry]], respectively.\n*Running back [[Le'Veon Bell]], who signed with the [[New York Jets]] on March 13, 2019.\n*Tight end [[Jesse James (tight end)|Jesse James]], who signed with the [[Detroit Lions]] on March 14, 2019.\n\nSeveral of these moves were made in the name of eliminating \"distractions\", namely from Brown and Bell.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://steelerswire.usatoday.com/2019/04/28/steelers-hc-mike-tomlin-calls-roster-moves-a-cleansing/ |title=Steelers HC Mike Tomlin calls roster moves a 'cleansing' |last=Popejoy |first=Curt |date=April 28, 2019 |website=Steelers Wire |publisher=USA Today Sports |access-date=July 13, 2019 }}</ref> Brown had several clashes with the coaching staff, sports media and teammates (most notably [[Ben Roethlisberger]] and [[JuJu Smith-Schuster]]) and was subsequently benched in the Steelers season finale against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], which led to Brown demanding a trade. Bell had been tagged with the [[franchise tag]] the previous two seasons and sat out the 2018 season; the Steelers opted not to tag him for a third time due to [[salary cap]] constraints as well as the emergence of fan favorite [[James Conner (American football)|James Conner]] and Bell subsequently signed with the Jets for less than what the Steelers had offered him. Gilbert was injured for much of 2018 and was made expendable due to the emergence of [[Matt Feiler]] in his spot.

It marked the 20th season under leadership of general manager [[Kevin Colbert]] and the 13th under [[List of Pittsburgh Steelers head coaches|head coach]] [[Mike Tomlin]].  The team failed to improve upon its 9\u20136\u20131 record from [[2018 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2018]] following a Week 16 loss to the [[2019 New York Jets season|New York Jets]].\n\nFor the first time since [[2013 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2013]], they started the season with a 1\u20134 coming into Week 5, which included a humiliating 33\u20133 blowout loss to the defending [[Super Bowl LIII|Super Bowl]] champion [[2019 New England Patriots|New England Patriots]], and an injury to [[Ben Roethlisberger]] the very next game. However, they went on to win seven out of their next eight games to sit in Week 14 of the season with a 8\u20135 record before they ended up losing three consecutive important games to end the 2019 season with an 8\u20138 record. They also tied for their worst record ([[2006 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2006]] (they were defending Super Bowl Champions), 2012, 2013) since the 2003 season. \n\nFor the first time since the [[2012 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2012]] and 2013 seasons, they were mathematically eliminated from postseason contention for the second consecutive year after a 28\u201310 loss to the [[2019 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] coupled with the [[2019 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] defeating the [[2019 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] 35\u201314 for the final AFC Wild Card spot in Week 17.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Roster moves==\nSeveral players who played significant roles in the Steelers' recent success did not return for 2019. Among the departed were:\n*Offensive tackle [[Marcus Gilbert (American football)| Marcus Gilbert]], traded to the [[Arizona Cardinals]] on March 8, 2019 for the Cardinals compensatory 6th round pick, used on [[Ulysees Gilbert III]].\n*Wide receiver [[Antonio Brown]], traded to the [[Oakland Raiders]] on March 9, 2019 for the Raiders 3rd and 5th round picks in the [[2019 NFL Draft]], used to select [[Diontae Johnson]] and [[Zach Gentry]], respectively.\n*Running back [[Le'Veon Bell]], who signed with the [[New York Jets]] on March 13, 2019.\n*Tight end [[Jesse James (tight end)|Jesse James]], who signed with the [[Detroit Lions]] on March 14, 2019.\n\nSeveral of these moves were made in the name of eliminating \"distractions\", namely from Brown and Bell.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://steelerswire.usatoday.com/2019/04/28/steelers-hc-mike-tomlin-calls-roster-moves-a-cleansing/ |title=Steelers HC Mike Tomlin calls roster moves a 'cleansing' |last=Popejoy |first=Curt |date=April 28, 2019 |website=Steelers Wire |publisher=USA Today Sports |access-date=July 13, 2019 }}</ref> Brown had several clashes with the coaching staff, sports media and teammates (most notably [[Ben Roethlisberger]] and [[JuJu Smith-Schuster]]) and was subsequently benched in the Steelers season finale against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], which led to Brown demanding a trade. Bell had been tagged with the [[franchise tag]] the previous two seasons and sat out the 2018 season; the Steelers opted not to tag him for a third time due to [[salary cap]] constraints as well as the emergence of fan favorite [[James Conner (American football)|James Conner]] and Bell subsequently signed with the Jets for less than what the Steelers had offered him. Gilbert was injured for much of 2018 and was made expendable due to the emergence of [[Matt Feiler]] in his spot. James, initially groomed to be the heir replacement to [[Heath Miller]], ultimately remained a backup after the Steelers traded for [[Vance McDonald]].\n\nIn addition to the players traded away and cut, [[Ryan Shazier]] remained out due to his 2017 spinal injury against the Bengals. After struggling to fill his role during the 2018 campaign, the Steelers addressed his long-term absence by going to the other side of the [[Michigan\u2013Ohio State football rivalry]] by trading up in the 2019 draft to draft [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] linebacker [[Devin Bush Jr.]] Shazier was subsequently placed on the reserve/PUP list for the 2019 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Steelers place Shazier on PUP list|url=https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-place-shazier-on-pup-list|author=Varley, Teresa|website=Steelers.com|date=April 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Draft===\n{{main|2019 NFL Draft}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Pittsburgh Steelers|year=2019|border=2}}\"| 2019 Pittsburgh Steelers Draft\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Pittsburgh Steelers|year=2019|border=2}}\"| Round\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Pittsburgh Steelers|year=2019|border=2}}\"| Selection\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Pittsburgh Steelers|year=2019|border=2}}\"| Player\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Pittsburgh Steelers|year=2019|border=2}}\"| Position\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Pittsburgh Steelers|year=2019|border=2}}\"| College\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Pittsburgh Steelers|year=2019|border=2}}\"| Notes\n|-\n!

On a rain soaked field, with [[Robert Griffin III]] at quarterback, the Ravens kept the ball on the ground for their first drive.  The drive covered 40 yards, took 7 minutes off the clock and culminated with a 45-yard  [[Justin Tucker]] field goal.  After the Ravens defense forced a three-and-out, the Ravens offense, highlighted by a [[Gus Edwards]] 38-yard run, drove down the field again, this time settling for a Tucker 22-yard field goal. The Steelers took the lead early in the second quarter after a [[Benny Snell]] 4-yard touchdown run. The Ravens regained the lead, 9\u20137, with another Tucker field goal with 1:10 remaining in the half. The Ravens got the ball back with 54 seconds left in the half when [[Matt Judon]] sacked Steeler quarterback [[Devlin Hodges]] forcing him to fumble. [[Justice Hill]]'s 8-yard touchdown run capped a Ravens 23 yard drive and the half ended with the Ravens leading 16\u20137. After the teams exchanged field goals, the Ravens defense, late in the fourth quarter, stripped the ball from Steeler's punter [[Jordan Berry]] and recovered it in the end zone for a touchdown. On the next Steelers possession the Ravens were awarded 2 points after Hodges was called for [[intentional grounding]] in the end zone, making the final score 28\u201310.<ref>{{cite web |title=Steelers Ravens Play-byPlay |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401127950 |website=espn.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the loss, the Steelers finished their season 8\u20138 and were eliminated from playoff contention.

''The Blue Chronicle'', a historical novel, is perhaps one of his best known works, it is about the events of the 13th century, and upholds humanistic and profoundly patriotic ideals.\n\nIn another of his important works, ''One-Storey Pavilion'', a two-part [[social novel]], he describes life in southern Inner Mongolia, and the tragic fate of its young people under the [[Mongolia during Qing rule|Manchu yoke]], and their struggle for human dignity.\n\n''One-Storey Pavilion'' and another novel ''The Chamber of Red Tears'' bear a striking resemblance to Chinese literature such as ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''. In addition, they contain a considerable number of Chinese loan words and direct translations from Chinese, which are difficult for readers unfamiliar with Chinese to understand. Anyway, he continued to write Mongolian and never adopted a pro-Chinese stance.<ref name=\"khishig\">\u010c.

He had a childhood name Khaschuluu (''qas\u010dila\u0263u'', \u0425\u0430\u0441\u0447\u0443\u043b\u0443\u0443, {{MongolUnicode|\u182c\u1820\u1830\u1824\u1834\u1822\u182f\u1820\u182d\u1824}}), Chinese name Baoying (\u5bf6\u745b) and courtesy name Runting (\u6f64\u4ead). His father Vanchinbal (''vang\u010dinbala'', \u0412\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0431\u0430\u043b, {{MongolUnicode|\u1838\u1820\u1829\u1834\u1822\u1828\u182a\u1820\u182f}}) was a [[taiji (Mongol title)]], and hence, a descendant of [[Genghis Khan]]. Injinash's mother was Vanchinbal taiji's lady Mayukha. Vanchinbal was a bookcollector of Mongolian, Classical Chinese, Manchu and Tibetan literature. According to Injinash's preface, the first eight chapters of ''The Blue Chronicle'' were written by Vanchinbal. His family was highly literate in Mongolian, Manchu, and Chinese languages.\n\nHis father, Vanchinbal, was a banner adiminstrator of T\u00fcmed Right Banner (modern Beipiao county, Liaoning province) and his position was inherited by two of his sons, Gularansa (1820\u201351) and S\u00fcngwaidanjung (1834\u201398). These two also translated the Chinese novel: Shuihu zhuan ([[Water Margin]]) into Mongolian, and like their middle brother, Gungnechuke (1832\u201366), were poets. Injinash claimed he worked on ''The Blue Chronicle'' with his two brothers. Injinash married twice and his first wife was the daughter of a [[Kharchin]] prince and had two sons.\n\nAs T\u00fcmed Right Wing Banner was close to China, it was subjected to an enormous population pressure from China. By the time Injinash was born, the banner has been transformed into agricultural land by the Chinese, who outnumbered the indigenous Mongols. Apparently, this situation led Injinash to depicts in ''The Blue Chronicle'' (Mongolian: K\u00f6ke Sudar) the glorious past of the Mongols of Genghis Khan's time.\n\nA rebellion by his family\u2019s Chinese tenants in 1870 and the failure of the Injinash family's investment in a coal mine caused financial distress.

''The Blue Chronicle'', a historical novel, is perhaps one of his best known works, it is about the events of the 13th century, and upholds humanistic and profoundly patriotic ideals.\n\nIn another of his important works, ''One-Storey Pavilion'', a two-part [[social novel]], he describes life in southern Inner Mongolia, and the tragic fate of its young people under the [[Mongolia during Qing rule|Manchu yoke]], and their struggle for human dignity.\n\n''One-Storey Pavilion'' and another novel ''The Chamber of Red Tears'' bear a striking resemblance to Chinese literature such as ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''. In addition, they contain a considerable number of Chinese loan words and direct translations from Chinese, which are difficult for readers unfamiliar with Chinese to understand. Anyway, he continued to write Mongolian and never adopted a pro-Chinese stance.<ref name=\"khishig\">\u010c.

He had a childhood name Khaschuluu (''qas\u010dila\u0263u'', \u0425\u0430\u0441\u0447\u0443\u043b\u0443\u0443, {{MongolUnicode|\u182c\u1820\u1830\u1824\u1834\u1822\u182f\u1820\u182d\u1824}}), Chinese name Baoying (\u5bf6\u745b) and courtesy name Runting (\u6f64\u4ead). His father Vanchinbal (''vang\u010dinbala'', \u0412\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0431\u0430\u043b, {{MongolUnicode|\u1838\u1820\u1829\u1834\u1822\u1828\u182a\u1820\u182f}}) was a [[taiji (Mongol title)]], and hence, a descendant of [[Genghis Khan]]. Injinash's mother was Vanchinbal taiji's lady Mayukha. Vanchinbal was a bookcollector of Mongolian, Classical Chinese, Manchu and Tibetan literature. According to Injinash's preface, the first eight chapters of ''The Blue Chronicle'' were written by Vanchinbal. His family was highly literate in Mongolian, Manchu, and Chinese languages.\n\nHis father, Vanchinbal, was a banner adiminstrator of T\u00fcmed Right Banner (modern Beipiao county, Liaoning province) and his position was inherited by two of his sons, Gularansa (1820\u201351) and S\u00fcngwaidanjung (1834\u201398). These two also translated the Chinese novel: Shuihu zhuan ([[Water Margin]]) into Mongolian, and like their middle brother, Gungnechuke (1832\u201366), were poets. Injinash claimed he worked on ''The Blue Chronicle'' with his two brothers. Injinash married twice and his first wife was the daughter of a [[Kharchin]] prince and had two sons.\n\nAs T\u00fcmed Right Wing Banner was close to China, it was subjected to an enormous population pressure from China. By the time Injinash was born, the banner has been transformed into agricultural land by the Chinese, who outnumbered the indigenous Mongols. Apparently, this situation led Injinash to depicts in ''The Blue Chronicle'' (Mongolian: K\u00f6ke Sudar) the glorious past of the Mongols of Genghis Khan's time.\n\nA rebellion by his family\u2019s Chinese tenants in 1870 and the failure of the Injinash family's investment in a coal mine caused financial distress. The ethnic tensions between the Mongols and Chinese resulted in the [[Jindandao Incident]] of 1891. The Chinese rebels massacred tens of thousands of Mongols and devastated the Mongol society of the Josutu and Ju'udu Leagues. These factors forced Injinash to flee to [[Jinzhou]], and he died in Liaoning on 25 February 1892.\n\n== Works ==\n* ''The Blue Chronicle'' (''k\u00f6ke sudur'', \u0425\u04e9\u0445 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440 (''Kh\u00f6kh Sudar''))\n* ''The Chamber of Red Tears'' (''ula\u0263an-a ukilaqu tingkim'', \u0423\u043b\u0430\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0430 \u0423\u0445\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0445 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u0445\u0438\u043c (''Ulaanaa Ukhilakh Tankhim''))\n* ''One-Storey Pavilion'' (''nigen dabqur asar'', \u041d\u044d\u0433\u044d\u043d \u0414\u0430\u0432\u0445\u0430\u0440 \u0410\u0441\u0430\u0440 (''Negen Davkhar Asar''))\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.mongolia.com.hk/english/country_info/country_info-5-02.htm  Oral and Written Literature] Consulate of Mongolia in Hong Kong\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Injinash, Vanchinbalyn}}\n[[Category:Borjigin]]\n[[Category:1837 births]]\n[[Category:1892 deaths]]\n[[Category:Mongolian poets]]\n[[Category:Mongolian writers]]\n[[Category:19th-century Mongolian writers]]\n[[Category:19th-century Mongolian poets]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing fromCategory:Mongolian writersusingCat-a-lot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanchinbalyn_Injinash"}
