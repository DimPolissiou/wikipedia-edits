Lara herself is hearing and is fluent in [[sign language]]. Even as a young child, she serves as an [[interpreter]] for her parents in many situations, such as credit negotiations at the bank as well as her own parent-teacher conference, although not always completely truthfully.\n\nLara receives a [[clarinet]] for Christmas from Clarissa, her father's sister and an enthusiastic musician. Lara discovers the world of music, where her parents cannot follow her. In the years that follow, she is discovered to be a talented clarinet player.\n\nAfter Kai is killed in a bicycle accident, Lara's grieving father feels abandoned. When 18-year-old Lara wants to study at a music conservatory in Berlin, the family seems to break apart. The ending seems to reconcile it all: Martin tries to understand the love of music that his daughter feels, and the film comes to a careful reunion between him and Lara.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Sylvie Testud]] as Lara\n* Tatjana Trieb as young Lara\n* [[Howie Seago]] as Martin\n* [[Emmanuelle Laborit]] as Kai\n* [[Sibylle Canonica]] as Clarissa\n* [[Matthias Habich]] as Gregor (Clarissa's husband)\n* Alexandra Bolz as Marie\n* Hansa Czypionka as Tom\n* [[Doris Schade]] as Lilli\n* [[Horst Sachtleben]] as Robert\n* Hubert Mulzer as Mister G\u00e4rtner\n* [[Birge Schade]] as Miss Mertens\n* [[Stephan Kampwirth]] as Bank Manager\n}}\n\n==Reviews==\n''Beyond Silence'' has an 83% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beyond_silence/ |title=Beyond Silence (1996) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}</ref>\n* \"A successful film debut of a graduate of the Munich Film Academy.

Lara discovers the world of music, where her parents cannot follow her. In the years that follow, she is discovered to be a talented clarinet player.\n\nAfter Kai is killed in a bicylce accident, Lara's grieving father feels abandoned. When 18-year-old Lara wants to study at a music conservatory in Berlin, the family seems to break apart. The ending seems to reconcile it all: Martin tries to understand the love of music that his daughter feels, and the film comes to a careful reunion between him and Lara.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Sylvie Testud]] as Lara\n* Tatjana Trieb as young Lara\n* [[Howie Seago]] as Martin\n* [[Emmanuelle Laborit]] as Kai\n* [[Sibylle Canonica]] as Clarissa\n* [[Matthias Habich]] as Gregor (Clarissa's husband)\n* Alexandra Bolz as Marie\n* Hansa Czypionka as Tom\n* [[Doris Schade]] as Lilli\n* [[Horst Sachtleben]] as Robert\n* Hubert Mulzer as Mister G\u00e4rtner\n* [[Birge Schade]] as Miss Mertens\n* [[Stephan Kampwirth]] as Bank Manager\n}}\n\n==Reviews==\n''Beyond Silence'' has an 83% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beyond_silence/ |title=Beyond Silence (1996) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}</ref>\n* \"A successful film debut of a graduate of the Munich Film Academy.

He appeared in over 100 films and television series, often playing supporting characters of various nationalities and ethnicities.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSokoloff was born in [[Moscow]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], to a family of [[German Jewish]]. He was raised bilingual, speaking both Russian and German. He studied theatre in [[Moscow]], first at the [[Moscow State University]] and later at the [[Russian Academy of Theatre Arts]], graduating in 1913. At one point a pupil of [[Constantin Stanislavski]], but he would later reject [[Method acting]] (as well as all other acting theories).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1323653/vladimir_sokoloff_on_acting/|title=Hollywood Glances!|author=Erskine Johnson|date=April 20, 1960|newspaper=Miami (Oklahoma) Daily News-Record|via=Newspapers.com}} {{Open access}}</ref> \n\n== Career ==\nUpon graduation, he joined the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] as an actor and assistant director.<ref name=\"AP\" /> Later in the decade, he joined the [[Kamerny Theatre]]. In the early 1923, he toured with his troupe in Germany, where he met dramatist [[Max Reinhardt]], who invited him to stay in Berlin. He appeared in numerous stage productions, and began acting in German and Austrian films, including ''[[The Love of Jeanne Ney]]'' (1927), ''[[The Ship of Lost Souls]]'' (1929), ''[[Farewell (1930 film)|Farewell]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930).\n\nWith the rise of [[Nazism]], the Jewish Sokoloff moved first to [[Paris]] in 1932, where he continued to act on stage and screen. In 1937, he emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1937.<ref>{{cite journal| title=The remarkable story of the Jewish film-makers in Germany during the early sound years, 1929-33| url=http://www.ajr.org.uk/index.cfm/section.journal/issue.Aug14/article=15492| last=Finler| first=Joel| date=August 2014| work=[[Association of Jewish Refugees#Publications|AJR Journal]]}}</ref> Although he spoke very little English at the time of his arrival, his first stage role there was a lead in [[Georg B\u00fcchner]]'s play ''[[Danton's Death]]'', under the direction of [[Orson Welles]]. Welles insisted that it would be demeaning for an actor of Sokoloff's reputation to play a small role and personally coached him in his English for the role, which he did phonetically. It was said that Welles was in awe of him and frequently asked him about his career in the Moscow Arts Theatre. \n\nThat same year, he had his English-language breakthrough starring in fellow expat [[William Dieterle]]'s ''[[The Life of Emile Zola]],'' portraying [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]. He appeared in a number of Broadway plays from 1937 to 1950.<ref>{{IBDB name|68775}}</ref> He also quickly found work in American films, playing characters of a wide variety of [[nationality|nationalities]] (he himself once estimated 35<ref name=\"AP\" />), for example, Filipino (''[[Back to Bataan]]''), French (''[[Passage to Marseille]]''), Greek (''[[Mr. Lucky (film)|Mr. Lucky]]''), Arab (''[[Road to Morocco]]''), Romanian (''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]''), and Chinese (''[[Macao (film)|Macao]]''). Among his better known parts are the Spanish guerrilla Anselmo in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943) and the Mexican Old Man in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, he also appeared on a number of [[television series]], including three episodes of [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' (\"[[Dust (The Twilight Zone)|Dust]]\", \"[[The Gift (The Twilight Zone)|The Gift]]\" and \"[[The Mirror (The Twilight Zone)|The Mirror]]\"). On January 1, 1961, Sokoloff guest starred as \"Old Stefano\", a wise shepherd, in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', with [[John Russell (actor)|John Russell]] and [[Peter Brown (actor)|Peter Brown]]. He also appeared on one episode of ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' entitled \"Troubleshooter\".\n\nHis final roles were in ''[[Escape from Zahrain]]'' and ''[[Taras Bulba (1962 film)|Taras Bulba]],'' both of which starred [[Yul Brynner]].

in Germany and France during the [[Silent era]], before emigrating to the United States in the 1930s. He appeared in over 100 films and television series, often playing supporting characters of various nationalities and ethnicities.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSokoloff was born in [[Moscow]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], to a family of [[German Jewish]]. He was raised billingual, speaking both Russian and German. He studied theatre in [[Moscow]], first at the [[Moscow State University]] and later at the [[Russian Academy of Theatre Arts]], graduating in 1913. At one point a pupil of [[Constantin Stanislavski]], but he would later reject [[Method acting]] (as well as all other acting theories).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1323653/vladimir_sokoloff_on_acting/|title=Hollywood Glances!|author=Erskine Johnson|date=April 20, 1960|newspaper=Miami (Oklahoma) Daily News-Record|via=Newspapers.com}} {{Open access}}</ref> \n\n== Career ==\nUpon graduation, he joined the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] as an actor and assistant director.<ref name=\"AP\" /> Later in the decade, he joined the [[Kamerny Theatre]]. In the early 1923, he toured with his troupe in Germany, where he met dramatist [[Max Reinhardt]], who invited him to stay in Berlin. He appeared in numerous stage productions, and began acting in German and Austrian films, including ''[[The Love of Jeanne Ney]]'' (1927), ''[[The Ship of Lost Souls]]'' (1929), ''[[Farewell (1930 film)|Farewell]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930).\n\nWith the rise of [[Nazism]], the Jewish Sokoloff moved first to [[Paris]] in 1932, where he continued to act on stage and screen. In 1937, he emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1937.<ref>{{cite journal| title=The remarkable story of the Jewish film-makers in Germany during the early sound years, 1929-33| url=http://www.ajr.org.uk/index.cfm/section.journal/issue.Aug14/article=15492| last=Finler| first=Joel| date=August 2014| work=[[Association of Jewish Refugees#Publications|AJR Journal]]}}</ref> Although he spoke very little English at the time of his arrival, his first stage role there was a lead in [[Georg B\u00fcchner]]'s play ''[[Danton's Death]]'', under the direction of [[Orson Welles]]. Welles insisted that it would be demeaning for an actor of Sokoloff's reputation to play a small role and personally coached him in his English for the role, which he did phonetically. It was said that Welles was in awe of him and frequently asked him about his career in the Moscow Arts Theatre. \n\nThat same year, he had his English-language breakthrough starring in fellow expat [[William Dieterle]]'s ''[[The Life of Emile Zola]],'' portraying [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]. He appeared in a number of Broadway plays from 1937 to 1950.<ref>{{IBDB name|68775}}</ref> He also quickly found work in American films, playing characters of a wide variety of [[nationality|nationalities]] (he himself once estimated 35<ref name=\"AP\" />), for example, Filipino (''[[Back to Bataan]]''), French (''[[Passage to Marseille]]''), Greek (''[[Mr. Lucky (film)|Mr. Lucky]]''), Arab (''[[Road to Morocco]]''), Romanian (''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]''), and Chinese (''[[Macao (film)|Macao]]''). Among his better known parts are the Spanish guerrilla Anselmo in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943) and the Mexican Old Man in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, he also appeared on a number of [[television series]], including three episodes of [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' (\"[[Dust (The Twilight Zone)|Dust]]\", \"[[The Gift (The Twilight Zone)|The Gift]]\" and \"[[The Mirror (The Twilight Zone)|The Mirror]]\"). On January 1, 1961, Sokoloff guest starred as \"Old Stefano\", a wise shepherd, in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', with [[John Russell (actor)|John Russell]] and [[Peter Brown (actor)|Peter Brown]]. He also appeared on one episode of ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' entitled \"Troubleshooter\".\n\nHis final roles were in ''[[Escape from Zahrain]]'' and ''[[Taras Bulba (1962 film)|Taras Bulba]],'' both of which starred [[Yul Brynner]].
