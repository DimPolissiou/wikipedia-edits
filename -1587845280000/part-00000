The term is borrowed from [[Rugby football|rugby]], where a scrum is a formation of players.

Henry and S. Henry. Quantitative assessment of the software maintenance process and requirements volatility. In Proc. of the ACM Conference on Computer Science, pages 346\u2013351, 1993.</ref>) and that there will be unpredictable challenges\u2014for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. \n\nAs such, Scrum adopts an evidence-based [[Empirical process|empirical approach]] \u2013 accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Hirotaka Takeuchi]] and [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] introduced the term ''scrum'' in the context of [[New product development|product development]] in their 1986 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, 'The New New Product Development Game'.<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\">{{Cite journal|last1=Takeuchi|first1=Hirotaka|last2=Nonaka|first2=Ikujiro|date=January 1, 1986|title=The New New Product Development Game|url=https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/86116-PDF-ENG|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=|pages=|accessdate=June 9, 2010|quote=Moving the Scrum Downfield|via=}}</ref> Takeuchi and Nonaka later argued in ''The Knowledge Creating Company''<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B-qxrPaU1-MC&dq=The+Knowledge+Creating+Company&printsec=frontcover|title= The Knowledge Creating Company|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|year= 1995|accessdate= March 12, 2013|isbn= 9780199762330}}</ref> that it is a form of \"organizational knowledge creation, [...] especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally\".\n\nThe authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer [[economic sector|industries]].<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> They called this the [[holistic]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]] approach, as the whole process is performed by one [[cross-functional team]] across multiple overlapping phases, in which the team \"tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth\".<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> (In [[rugby football]], a [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] is used to restart play, as the forwards of each team interlock with their heads down and attempt to gain possession of the ball.<ref>{{Oxford&nbsp;Dictionaries|Scrum}}</ref>)\n\nThe Scrum framework was based on research by Schwaber with Tunde Babatunde at DuPont Research Station and University of Delaware. Tunde advised that attempts to develop complex products, such as software, that weren't based in empiricism were doomed to higher risks and rates of failure as the initial conditions and assumptions change. Empiricism, using frequent inspection and adaptation, with flexibility and transparency is the most suitable approach.\n\nIn the early 1990s, [[Ken Schwaber]] used what would become Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods; while [[Jeff Sutherland]], John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation, referring to it using the single word scrum.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url= https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171122013020/https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archivedate= November 22, 2017|format= PDF|title= Agile Development: Lessons learned from the first Scrum|last= Sutherland|first= Jeff|authorlink= Jeff Sutherland|date= October 2004|accessdate= September 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nKen and Jeff worked together to integrate their ideas into a single framework, Scrum.

Therefore a good product owner should be able to communicate what the business needs, ask why they need it (because there may be better ways to achieve that), and convey the message to all stakeholders including the Development Team using a technical language, as required. The Product Owner uses Scrum\u2019s empirical tools to manage highly complex work, while controlling risk and achieving value.\n\nCommunication is a core responsibility of the product owner. The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love|last=Pichler|first=Roman|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-68413-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm|title= The Product Owner Role: A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams|last= Ambler|first= Scott|publisher= agilemodeling.com|access-date= July 22, 2016 |  quote =  [...] in practice there proves to be two critical aspects to this role: first as a stakeholder proxy within the development team and second as a project team representative to the overall stakeholder community as a whole.}}</ref>\n\nAs the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the communication tasks of the product owner to the stakeholders:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Product Owner Role|url=http://scrum-master.thinkific.com/pages/the-product-owner-role|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n* Define and announce releases.\n* Communicate delivery and team status.\n* Share progress during governance meetings.\n* Share significant RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions) with stakeholders.\n* Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.\n* Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.\n\nEmpathy is a key attribute for a product owner to have\u2014the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A product owner converses with different stakeholders, who have a variety of backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A product owner must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a product owner to know the level of detail the audience needs. The development team needs thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest and waste time. A direct means of communication is the most preferred by seasoned agile product owners.<ref name=\":1\">Cohn, Mike. Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum.

While no work should come to the team except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from too much distraction, the team should still be encouraged to interact directly with customers and/or stakeholders to gain maximum understanding and immediacy of feedback.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Scrum master ===\n\nScrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.<ref>Carroll, N, O\u2019Connor, M. and Edison, H.

Product backlog items may be broken into multiple smaller ones. Acceptance criteria may be clarified. Dependencies may be identified and investigated.\n\nAlthough not originally a core Scrum practice, backlog refinement has been added to the Scrum Guide and adopted as a way of managing the quality of product backlog items entering a sprint, with a recommended investment of up to 10% of a team's sprint capacity.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Cho|first=L|title=Adopting an Agile Culture A User Experience Team's Journey|journal=Agile Conference|year=2009|doi=10.1109/AGILE.2009.76|isbn=978-0-7695-3768-9|pages=416\u2013421}}</ref>\n\nThe backlog can also include [[technical debt]] (also known as design debt or code debt). This is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.\n\n=== Cancelling a sprint ===\n\nThe product owner can cancel a sprint if necessary.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /> The product owner may do so with input from the team, scrum master or management. For instance, management may wish the product owner to cancel a sprint if external circumstances negate the value of the sprint goal. If a sprint is abnormally terminated, the next step is to conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.\n\n== Artifacts ==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Product backlog ===\n\nThe product backlog is a breakdown of work to be done<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sedano|first1=Todd|last2=Ralph|first2=Paul|last3=P\u00e9raire|first3=C\u00e9cile|title=The Product Backlog|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330823863_The_Product_Backlog|publisher=IEEE}}</ref> and contains an ordered list of [[Requirement|product requirements]] that a scrum team maintains for a [[New product development|product]]. Common formats include [[user story|user stories]] and [[use case]]s.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\" /> The requirements define [[Software feature|feature]]s, [[Patch (computing)|bug fix]]es, [[non-functional requirement]]s, etc.\u2014whatever must be done to deliver a viable product. The product owner prioritizes product backlog items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, size, and date needed.\n\nThe product backlog is what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered. It is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner, who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose.\n\nThe product backlog contains the product owner's assessment of business value and the development team's assessment of development effort, which are often, but not always, stated in [[Planning poker|story points]] using the [[Fibonacci scale (agile)|rounded Fibonacci scale]]. These estimates help the product owner to gauge the timeline and may influence the ordering of product backlog items; for example, if two features have the same business value, the product owner may schedule earlier delivery of the one with the lower development effort (because the [[return on investment]] is higher) or the one with higher development effort (because it is more complex or riskier, and they want to retire that risk earlier).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.batimes.com/articles/authoring-requirements-in-an-agile-world.html|title= Authoring Requirements in an Agile World|publisher= BA Times|first= Tony|last= Higgins|date= March 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner. The effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points, or time. By estimating in story points, the team reduces the dependency in individual developers; this is useful especially in dynamic teams where developers are often assigned to other projects after sprint delivery. For instance, if a user story is estimated as a 5 in effort (using Fibonacci sequence), it remains 5 regardless of how many developers are working on it\n\nStory points define the effort in a time-box, so they do not change with time. For instance, in one hour an individual can walk, run, or climb, but the effort expended is clearly different. The gap progression between the terms in the Fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates. Estimates of 1, 2 or 3 imply similar efforts (1 being trivial), but if the team estimates an 8 or 13 (or higher), the impact on both delivery and budget can be significant. The value of using story points is that the team can reuse them by comparing similar work from previous sprints, but it should be recognized that estimates are relative to the team. For example, an estimate of 5 for one team could be a 2 for another having senior developers and higher skills.\n\nEvery team should have a product owner, although in many instances a product owner could work with more than one team.<ref name=\":1\" /> The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product. The product owner gathers input and takes feedback from, and is lobbied by, many people, but ultimately makes the call on what gets built.\n\nThe product backlog:\n\n* Captures requests to modify a product\u2014including new features, replacing old features, removing features, and fixing issues\n* Ensures the development team has work that maximizes business benefit to the product owner\n\nTypically, the product owner and the scrum team work together to develop the breakdown of work; this becomes the product backlog, which evolves as new information surfaces about the product and about its customers, and so later sprints may address new work.\n\n==== Management ====\n\nA product backlog, in its simplest form, is merely a list of items to work on. Having well-established rules about how work is added, removed and ordered helps the whole team make better decisions about how to change the product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs|title=The product backlog: your ultimate to-do list|website=Atlassian|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe product owner prioritizes product backlog items based on which are needed soonest. The team then chooses which items they can complete in the coming sprint. On the scrum board, the team moves items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog, which is the list of items they will build. Conceptually, it is ideal for the team to only select what they think they can accomplish from the top of the list, but it is not unusual to see in practice that teams are able to take lower-priority items from the list along with the top ones selected. This normally happens because there is time left within the sprint to accommodate more work. Items at the top of the backlog, the items to work on first, should be broken down into stories that are suitable for the development team to work on. The further down the backlog goes, the less refined the items should be. As Schwaber and Beedle put it \"The lower the priority, the less detail until you can barely make out the backlog item.\"<ref name=\"schwaber\" />\n\nAs the team works through the backlog, it must be assumed that change happens outside their environment\u2014the team can learn about new market opportunities to take advantage of, competitor threats that arise, and feedback from customers that can change the way the product was meant to work. All of these new ideas tend to trigger the team to adapt the backlog to incorporate new knowledge. This is part of the fundamental mindset of an agile team. The world changes, the backlog is never finished.<ref name=\"Pichler, Roman 2010\">Pichler, Roman. ''Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love''.

The development team should keep in mind its past performance assessing its capacity for the new-sprint, and use this as a guideline of how much 'effort' they can complete.\n\nThe product backlog items may be broken down into tasks by the development team.<ref name=\"MartinelliMilosevic2016\" /> Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned (or pushed) to team members by someone else; rather team members sign up for (or pull) tasks as needed according to the backlog priority and their own skills and capacity. This promotes self-organization of the development team and developer buy-in.\n\nThe sprint backlog is the property of the development team, and all included estimates are provided by the development team. Often an accompanying task board is used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint, like to do, in progress and done.\n\nOnce a sprint backlog is committed, no additional work can be added to the sprint backlog except by the team. Once a sprint has been delivered, the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary, and the next set of functionality is selected for the next sprint.\n\n=== Increment ===\n\nThe ''increment'' is the potentially releasable output of the sprint that meets the sprint goal. It is formed from all the completed sprint backlog items, integrated with the work of all previous sprints. The increment must be complete, according to the scrum team's ''definition of done'' (DoD), fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to actually deploy and use it.\n\n=== Extensions ===\n\nThe following artifacts and techniques can be used to help people use Scrum.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n==== Sprint burndown chart ====\n\n[[File:SampleBurndownChart.svg|thumb|A sample burndown chart for a completed sprint, showing remaining effort at the end of each day.]]\n\n{{main|Burn down chart}}\n\nThe sprint burndown chart is a publicly displayed chart showing remaining work in the sprint backlog.<ref name=\"Cobb2015\">{{cite book|author=Charles G. Cobb|title=The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHjTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA378|date=January 27, 2015|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-99104-6|page=378}}</ref> Updated every day, it gives a simple view of the sprint progress. It also provides quick visualizations for reference. The horizontal axis of the sprint burndown chart shows the days in a sprint, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work remaining each day (typically representing the estimate of hours of work remaining).\n\nDuring sprint planning, the ideal burndown chart is plotted. Then, during the sprint, each member picks up tasks from the sprint backlog and works on them. At the end of the day, they update the remaining hours for tasks to be completed. In such a way, the actual burndown chart is updated day by day.\n\nIt should not be confused with an [[earned value management|earned value chart]].\n\n==== Release burn-up chart ====\n\n[[File:SampleBurnupChart.png|thumb|A sample burn-up chart for a release, showing scope completed each sprint (MVP = Minimum Viable Product)]]\n\nThe release burn-up chart is a way for the team to provide visibility and track progress toward a release. Updated at the end of each sprint, it shows progress toward delivering a forecast scope. The horizontal axis of the release burn-up chart shows the sprints in a release, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work completed at the end of each sprint (typically representing cumulative story points of work completed). Progress is plotted as a line that grows up to meet a horizontal line that represents the forecast scope; often shown with a forecast, based on progress to date, that indicates how much scope might be completed by a given release date or how many sprints it will take to complete the given scope.\n\nThe release burn-up chart makes it easy to see how much work has been completed, how much work has been added or removed (if the horizontal scope line moves), and how much work is left to be done.\n\n==== Definition of ready (DoR) ====\nThe start criteria to determine whether the [[specification]]s and inputs are set enough to start the work item, i.e. a [[user story]].\n\n==== Definition of done (DoD) ====\nThe [[exit-criteria]] to determine whether a product backlog item is complete. In many cases, the DoD requires that all [[regression testing|regression tests]] be successful. The definition of done may vary from one scrum team to another but must be consistent within one team.<ref>Ken Schwaber, ''Agile Project Management with Scrum'', p.55</ref>\n\n==== Velocity ====\n\nThe total effort a team is capable of in a sprint. The number is derived by evaluating the work (typically in [[user story]] points) completed in the last sprint. The collection of historical velocity data is a guideline for assisting the team in understanding how much work they can likely achieve in a future sprint.\n\n==== Spike ====\n\nA time-boxed period used to research a concept or create a simple prototype. Spikes can either be planned to take place in between sprints or, for larger teams, a spike might be accepted as one of many sprint delivery objectives. Spikes are often introduced before the delivery of large or complex product backlog items in order to secure budget, expand knowledge, or produce a proof of concept. The duration and objective(s) of a spike is agreed between product owner and development team before the start. Unlike sprint commitments, spikes may or may not deliver tangible, shippable, valuable functionality. For example, the objective of a spike might be to successfully reach a decision on a course of action. The spike is over when the time is up, not necessarily when the objective has been delivered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html|title=Create a Spike Solution|publisher=Extreme Programming}}</ref>\n\n==== Tracer bullet ====\n\nAlso called a drone spike, a tracer bullet is a spike with the current architecture, current technology set, current set of best practices that result in production quality code. It might just be a very narrow implementation of the functionality but is not throwaway code. It is of production quality, and the rest of the iterations can build on this code. The name has military origins as [[Tracer ammunition|ammunition]] that makes the path of the bullet visible, allowing for corrections. Often these implementations are a 'quick shot' through all layers of an application, such as connecting a single form's input field to the back-end, to prove the layers connect as expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingagile.com/2007/10/22/research-spikes-tracer-bullets-oh-my/|title=Research, Spikes, Tracer Bullets, Oh My!|last=Sterling|first=Chris|date=October 22, 2007|website=Getting Agile|access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nThe benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve when:<ref>{{cite journal |title=Limitations of Agile Software Processes |journal=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Extreme Programming and Flexible Processes in Software Engineering |pages=43\u201346 |orig-year=2002 |arxiv=1409.6600v1 |last1=Turk |first1=Dan |last2=France |first2=Robert |last3=Rumpe |first3=Bernhard |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ijser.org/researchpaper/Issues-and-Challenges-in-Scrum-Implementation.pdf |title=Issues and Challenges in Scrum Implementation |journal=International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research |volume=3 |issue=8 |date=August 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* '''Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time''': In Scrum, developers should have close and ongoing interaction, ideally working together in the same space most of the time. While recent improvements in technology have reduced the impact of these barriers (e.g., being able to collaborate on a digital whiteboard), the Agile manifesto asserts that the best communication is face to face.<ref name=\"AgileManifesto\">{{cite web|url=http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html|title=Principles behind the Agile Manifesto |year=2001 |website=|publisher=Agile Alliance |author=[[Kent Beck]] |author2=James Grenning |author3=[[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C.

This can be encouraged by good Scrum leadership. While team members with very specific skills can and do contribute well, they should be encouraged to learn more about and collaborate with other disciplines.\n* '''Products with many external dependencies''': In Scrum, dividing product development into short sprints requires careful planning; external dependencies, such as [[user acceptance testing]] or coordination with other teams, can lead to delays and the failure of individual sprints.\n* '''Products that are [[Product life-cycle theory|mature]] or [[Legacy system|legacy]] or with regulated [[quality control]]''': In Scrum, product increments should be fully developed and tested in a single sprint; products that need large amounts of [[regression testing]] or safety testing (e.g., medical devices or vehicle control) for each release are less suited to short sprints than to longer [[waterfall model|waterfall]] releases.\n\nFrom a business perspective, Scrum has many virtues, one of which is that it is designed to yield the best business solutions. However, the efficiency by which it does so in any given organization can vary widely and is largely dependent on the ability of the organization to adhere to the implementation guidelines. Every company has its own distinct organizational structure, culture, and set of business practices, and some are more naturally amenable to this methodology than others.\n\n== Tools for implementation ==\n{{Main|Comparison of Scrum software}}\nLike other agile methods, effective adoption of Scrum can be supported through a wide range of tools.\n\nMany companies use universal tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are also open-source and proprietary software packages for Scrum\u2014which are either dedicated to product development using the Scrum framework or support multiple product development approaches including Scrum.\n\nOther organizations implement Scrum without software tools and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://targetprocess.com/download/whitepaper/agiletools.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agile Tools.

All work within the Scrum framework should be visible to those responsible for the outcome: the process, the workflow, progress, etc. In order to make these things visible, scrum teams need to frequently inspect the product being developed and how well the team is working. With frequent inspection, the team can spot when their work deviates outside of acceptable limits and adapt their process or the product under development.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Scrum: an ideal framework for agile projects|last=Morris|first=David|publisher=In Easy Steps|year=2017|isbn=9781840787313|location=|pages=178\u2013179|oclc=951453155}}</ref>\n\nThese three pillars require trust and openness in the team, which the following five values of Scrum enable:<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n# Commitment: Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every [[Sprint (software development)|sprint]].\n# Courage: Team members know they have the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing.\n# Focus: Team members focus exclusively on their team goals and the sprint backlog; there should be no work done other than through their backlog.\n# Openness: Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.\n# Respect: Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\nThe hybridization of Scrum with other software development methodologies is common as Scrum does not cover the whole [[software lifecycle|product development lifecycle]]; therefore, organizations find the need to add in additional processes to create a more comprehensive implementation. For example, at the start of product development, organizations commonly add process guidance on the business case, requirements gathering and prioritization, initial high-level design, and budget and schedule forecasting.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Hron, M. |author2=Obwegeser, N.|date=January 2018|title=Scrum in practice: an overview of Scrum adaptations|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/116906219/Hron_Obwegeser_Scrum_in_practice_An_overview_of_Scrum_adaptations.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 2018 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), January 3-6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nVarious authors and communities of people who use Scrum have also suggested more detailed techniques for how to apply or adapt Scrum to particular problems or organizations.  Many refer to these methodological techniques as 'patterns' - by analogy with [[design pattern]]s in architecture and software.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/a/scrumorgpatterns.com/www/|title=Scrum as Organizational Patterns |last=Bj\u00f8rnvig|first=Gertrud|last2=Coplien|first2=Jim|date=June 21, 2008|website=|publisher=Gertrude & Cope}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrumplop.org|title=Scrum Pattern Community |website=ScrumPLoP.org|access-date=July 22, 2016}}</ref> Such patterns have extended Scrum outside of the software development domain into Manufacturing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agilebusinessmanagement.org/content/wikispeed-%E2%80%93-applying-agile-software-principles-and-practices-fast-automotive-development|title=WIKISPEED \u2013 Applying Agile software principles and practices for fast automotive development|date=December 3, 2013|website=|publisher=Agile Business Management Consortium |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref> Finance and [[Human Resources]].\n\n=== Scrumban ===\n{{Main|Scrumban}}\n\nScrumban is a software production model based on Scrum and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]]. Scrumban is especially suited for [[Software maintenance|product maintenance]] with frequent and unexpected work items, such as [[Software bug|production defects]] or programming errors. In such cases the time-limited sprints of the Scrum framework may be perceived to be of less benefit, although Scrum's daily events and other practices can still be applied, depending on the team and the situation at hand. Visualization of the work stages and limitations for simultaneous unfinished work and defects are familiar from the Kanban model. Using these methods, the team's [[workflow]] is directed in a way that allows for minimum completion time for each work item or programming error, and on the other hand ensures each team member is constantly employed.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook|title=Kanban and Scrum - Making the most of both|last=Kniberg|first=Henrik|last2=Skarin|first2=Mattias|date=December 21, 2009 |website=|publisher=InfoQ|format=PDF|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTo illustrate each stage of work, teams working in the same space often use post-it notes or a large whiteboard.<ref name=\"scrumban\">{{cite web|url=http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/|title=scrum-ban|last=Ladas|first=Corey|date=October 27, 2007|publisher=Lean Software Engineering|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref> In the case of decentralized teams, stage-illustration software such as [[Assembla]], [[Jira (software)|JIRA]] or [[Agilo for Trac|Agilo]] can be used.\n\nThe major differences between Scrum and Kanban is that in Scrum work is divided into sprints that last a fixed amount of time, whereas in Kanban the flow of work is continuous. This is visible in work stage tables, which in Scrum are emptied after each sprint, whereas in Kanban all tasks are marked on the same table. Scrum focuses on teams with multifaceted know-how, whereas Kanban makes specialized, functional teams possible.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\" />\n\n=== Scrum of scrums ===\n\nThe scrum of scrums is a technique to operate Scrum at scale, for multiple teams working on the same product, allowing them to discuss progress on their interdependencies, focusing on how to coordinate delivering software,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" /> especially on areas of overlap and integration. Depending on the cadence (timing) of the scrum of scrums, the relevant daily scrum for each scrum team ends by designating one member as an ambassador to participate in the scrum of scrums with ambassadors from other teams. Depending on the context, the ambassadors may be technical contributors or each team's scrum master.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\">{{cite web |publisher=Agile Alliance |title=Scrum of Scrums |url=http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/scrumofscrums.html |date=December 17, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nRather than simply a progress update, the scrum of scrums should focus on how teams are collectively working to resolve, mitigate, or accept any risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions (RIDAs) that have been identified. The scrum of scrums tracks these RIDAs via a backlog of its own, such as a risk board (sometimes known as a ''ROAM board'' after the initials of resolved, owned, accepted, and mitigated),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutagile.com/risk-management-how-to-stop-risks-from-screwing-up-your-projects/ |title=Risk Management \u2013 How to Stop Risks from Screwing Up Your Projects!|publisher=Kelly Waters}}</ref> which typically leads to greater coordination and collaboration between teams.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\nThis should run similar to a daily scrum, with each ambassador answering the following four questions:<ref>{{cite web|title=Scrum of Scrums|url=http://scrummastertest.com/scrum-of-scrums/|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions has your team resolved since we last met?\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions will your team resolve before we meet again?\n* Are there any new risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions slowing your team down or getting in their way?\n* Are you about to introduce a new risk, impediment, dependency, or assumption that will get in another team's way?\n\nAs [[Jeff Sutherland]] commented,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\n<blockquote>Since I originally defined the Scrum of Scrums (Ken Schwaber was at IDX working with me), I can definitively say the Scrum of Scrums is not a 'meta Scrum'. The Scrum of Scrums as I have used it is responsible for delivering the working software of all teams to the Definition of Done at the end of the sprint, or for releases during the sprint. PatientKeeper delivered to production four times per Sprint. Ancestry.com delivers to production 220 times per two-week Sprint. Hubspot delivers live software 100-300 times a day. The Scrum of Scrums Master is held accountable for making this work. So the Scrum of Scrums is an operational delivery mechanism.</blockquote>\n\n===Large-scale Scrum===\nLarge-scale Scrum (LeSS) is a product development framework that extends Scrum with scaling rules and guidelines without losing the original purposes of Scrum.\n\nThere are two levels to the framework: the first LeSS level is designed for up to eight teams; the second level, known as 'LeSS Huge', introduces additional scaling elements for development with up to hundreds of developers. \"Scaling Scrum starts with understanding and being able to adopt standard real one-team Scrum. Large-scale Scrum requires examining the purpose of single-team Scrum elements and figuring out how to reach the same purpose while staying within the constraints of the standard Scrum rules.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larman |last2=scrumyear=2013 |title=Scaling Agile Development (Crosstalk journal, November / December 2013)|url=http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2013/201305/201305-larman.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBas Vodde and [[Craig Larman]] evolved the LeSS framework from their experiences working with large-scale product development, especially in the telecoms and finance industries.

Henry and S. Henry. Quantitative assessment of the software maintenance process and requirements volatility. In Proc. of the ACM Conference on Computer Science, pages 346\u2013351, 1993.</ref>) and that there will be unpredictable challenges\u2014for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. \n\nAs such, Scrum adopts an evidence-based [[Empirical process|empirical approach]] \u2013 accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Hirotaka Takeuchi]] and [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] introduced the term ''scrum'' in the context of [[New product development|product development]] in their 1986 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, 'The New New Product Development Game'.<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\">{{Cite journal|last1=Takeuchi|first1=Hirotaka|last2=Nonaka|first2=Ikujiro|date=January 1, 1986|title=The New New Product Development Game|url=https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/86116-PDF-ENG|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=|pages=|accessdate=June 9, 2010|quote=Moving the Scrum Downfield|via=}}</ref> Takeuchi and Nonaka later argued in ''The Knowledge Creating Company''<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B-qxrPaU1-MC&dq=The+Knowledge+Creating+Company&printsec=frontcover|title= The Knowledge Creating Company|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|year= 1995|accessdate= March 12, 2013|isbn= 9780199762330}}</ref> that it is a form of \"organizational knowledge creation, [...] especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally\".\n\nThe authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer [[economic sector|industries]].<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> They called this the [[holistic]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]] approach, as the whole process is performed by one [[cross-functional team]] across multiple overlapping phases, in which the team \"tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth\".<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> (In [[rugby football]], a [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] is used to restart play, as the forwards of each team interlock with their heads down and attempt to gain possession of the ball.<ref>{{Oxford&nbsp;Dictionaries|Scrum}}</ref>)\n\nThe Scrum framework was based on research by Schwaber with Tunde Babatunde at DuPont Research Station and University of Delaware. Tunde advised that attempts to develop complex products, such as software, that weren't based in empiricism were doomed to higher risks and rates of failure as the initial conditions and assumptions change. Empiricism, using frequent inspection and adaptation, with flexibility and transparency is the most suitable approach.\n\nIn the early 1990s, [[Ken Schwaber]] used what would become Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods; while [[Jeff Sutherland]], John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation, referring to it using the single word scrum.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url= https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171122013020/https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archivedate= November 22, 2017|format= PDF|title= Agile Development: Lessons learned from the first Scrum|last= Sutherland|first= Jeff|authorlink= Jeff Sutherland|date= October 2004|accessdate= September 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nKen and Jeff worked together to integrate their ideas into a single framework, Scrum.

Therefore a good product owner should be able to communicate what the business needs, ask why they need it (because there may be better ways to achieve that), and convey the message to all stakeholders including the Development Team using a technical language, as required. The Product Owner uses Scrum\u2019s empirical tools to manage highly complex work, while controlling risk and achieving value.\n\nCommunication is a core responsibility of the product owner. The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love|last=Pichler|first=Roman|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-68413-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm|title= The Product Owner Role: A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams|last= Ambler|first= Scott|publisher= agilemodeling.com|access-date= July 22, 2016 |  quote =  [...] in practice there proves to be two critical aspects to this role: first as a stakeholder proxy within the development team and second as a project team representative to the overall stakeholder community as a whole.}}</ref>\n\nAs the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the communication tasks of the product owner to the stakeholders:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Product Owner Role|url=http://scrum-master.thinkific.com/pages/the-product-owner-role|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n* Define and announce releases.\n* Communicate delivery and team status.\n* Share progress during governance meetings.\n* Share significant RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions) with stakeholders.\n* Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.\n* Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.\n\nEmpathy is a key attribute for a product owner to have\u2014the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A product owner converses with different stakeholders, who have a variety of backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A product owner must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a product owner to know the level of detail the audience needs. The development team needs thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest and waste time. A direct means of communication is the most preferred by seasoned agile product owners.<ref name=\":1\">Cohn, Mike. Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2010.</ref>\n\nA product owner's ability to communicate effectively is also enhanced by being skilled in techniques that identify stakeholder needs, negotiate priorities between stakeholder interests, and collaborate with developers to ensure effective implementation of requirements.\n\n=== Development team ===\n\nThe development team has from three to nine members who carry out all tasks required to build increments of valuable output every sprint.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWhile team members are referred to as ''developers'' in some literature<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />, the term refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the system or product, and can include researchers, architects, designers, data specialists, statisticians, analysts, engineers, programmers, and testers, among others.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, due to the confusion that can arise when some people do not feel the term 'developer' applies to them, they are often referred to just as ''team members''. \n\nThe team is self-organizing. While no work should come to the team except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from too much distraction, the team should still be encouraged to interact directly with customers and/or stakeholders to gain maximum understanding and immediacy of feedback.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Scrum master ===\n\nScrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.<ref>Carroll, N, O\u2019Connor, M. and Edison, H.

What did not go well? What could be improved for better productivity in the next sprint?\n* The recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week sprint (proportional for other sprint duration(s))\n* This event is facilitated by the scrum master\n\n=== Backlog refinement ===\n\nBacklog [[Refinement (computing)|refinement]] (formerly called grooming) is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity. Product backlog items may be broken into multiple smaller ones. Acceptance criteria may be clarified. Dependencies may be identified and investigated.\n\nAlthough not originally a core Scrum practice, backlog refinement has been added to the Scrum Guide and adopted as a way of managing the quality of product backlog items entering a sprint, with a recommended investment of up to 10% of a team's sprint capacity.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Cho|first=L|title=Adopting an Agile Culture A User Experience Team's Journey|journal=Agile Conference|year=2009|doi=10.1109/AGILE.2009.76|isbn=978-0-7695-3768-9|pages=416\u2013421}}</ref>\n\nThe backlog can also include [[technical debt]] (also known as design debt or code debt). This is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.\n\n=== Cancelling a sprint ===\n\nThe product owner can cancel a sprint if necessary.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /> The product owner may do so with input from the team, scrum master or management. For instance, management may wish the product owner to cancel a sprint if external circumstances negate the value of the sprint goal. If a sprint is abnormally terminated, the next step is to conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.\n\n== Artifacts ==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Product backlog ===\n\nThe product backlog is a breakdown of work to be done<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sedano|first1=Todd|last2=Ralph|first2=Paul|last3=P\u00e9raire|first3=C\u00e9cile|title=The Product Backlog|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330823863_The_Product_Backlog|publisher=IEEE}}</ref> and contains an ordered list of [[Requirement|product requirements]] that a scrum team maintains for a [[New product development|product]]. Common formats include [[user story|user stories]] and [[use case]]s.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\" /> The requirements define [[Software feature|feature]]s, [[Patch (computing)|bug fix]]es, [[non-functional requirement]]s, etc.\u2014whatever must be done to deliver a viable product. The product owner prioritizes product backlog items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, size, and date needed.\n\nThe product backlog is what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered. It is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner, who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose.\n\nThe product backlog contains the product owner's assessment of business value and the development team's assessment of development effort, which are often, but not always, stated in [[Planning poker|story points]] using the [[Fibonacci scale (agile)|rounded Fibonacci scale]]. These estimates help the product owner to gauge the timeline and may influence the ordering of product backlog items; for example, if two features have the same business value, the product owner may schedule earlier delivery of the one with the lower development effort (because the [[return on investment]] is higher) or the one with higher development effort (because it is more complex or riskier, and they want to retire that risk earlier).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.batimes.com/articles/authoring-requirements-in-an-agile-world.html|title= Authoring Requirements in an Agile World|publisher= BA Times|first= Tony|last= Higgins|date= March 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner. The effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points, or time. By estimating in story points, the team reduces the dependency in individual developers; this is useful especially in dynamic teams where developers are often assigned to other projects after sprint delivery. For instance, if a user story is estimated as a 5 in effort (using Fibonacci sequence), it remains 5 regardless of how many developers are working on it\n\nStory points define the effort in a time-box, so they do not change with time. For instance, in one hour an individual can walk, run, or climb, but the effort expended is clearly different. The gap progression between the terms in the Fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates. Estimates of 1, 2 or 3 imply similar efforts (1 being trivial), but if the team estimates an 8 or 13 (or higher), the impact on both delivery and budget can be significant. The value of using story points is that the team can reuse them by comparing similar work from previous sprints, but it should be recognized that estimates are relative to the team. For example, an estimate of 5 for one team could be a 2 for another having senior developers and higher skills.\n\nEvery team should have a product owner, although in many instances a product owner could work with more than one team.<ref name=\":1\" /> The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product. The product owner gathers input and takes feedback from, and is lobbied by, many people, but ultimately makes the call on what gets built.\n\nThe product backlog:\n\n* Captures requests to modify a product\u2014including new features, replacing old features, removing features, and fixing issues\n* Ensures the development team has work that maximizes business benefit to the product owner\n\nTypically, the product owner and the scrum team work together to develop the breakdown of work; this becomes the product backlog, which evolves as new information surfaces about the product and about its customers, and so later sprints may address new work.\n\n==== Management ====\n\nA product backlog, in its simplest form, is merely a list of items to work on. Having well-established rules about how work is added, removed and ordered helps the whole team make better decisions about how to change the product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs|title=The product backlog: your ultimate to-do list|website=Atlassian|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe product owner prioritizes product backlog items based on which are needed soonest. The team then chooses which items they can complete in the coming sprint. On the scrum board, the team moves items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog, which is the list of items they will build. Conceptually, it is ideal for the team to only select what they think they can accomplish from the top of the list, but it is not unusual to see in practice that teams are able to take lower-priority items from the list along with the top ones selected. This normally happens because there is time left within the sprint to accommodate more work. Items at the top of the backlog, the items to work on first, should be broken down into stories that are suitable for the development team to work on. The further down the backlog goes, the less refined the items should be. As Schwaber and Beedle put it \"The lower the priority, the less detail until you can barely make out the backlog item.\"<ref name=\"schwaber\" />\n\nAs the team works through the backlog, it must be assumed that change happens outside their environment\u2014the team can learn about new market opportunities to take advantage of, competitor threats that arise, and feedback from customers that can change the way the product was meant to work. All of these new ideas tend to trigger the team to adapt the backlog to incorporate new knowledge. This is part of the fundamental mindset of an agile team. The world changes, the backlog is never finished.<ref name=\"Pichler, Roman 2010\">Pichler, Roman. ''Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love''.

The development team should keep in mind its past performance assessing its capacity for the new-sprint, and use this as a guideline of how much 'effort' they can complete.\n\nThe product backlog items may be broken down into tasks by the development team.<ref name=\"MartinelliMilosevic2016\" /> Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned (or pushed) to team members by someone else; rather team members sign up for (or pull) tasks as needed according to the backlog priority and their own skills and capacity. This promotes self-organization of the development team and developer buy-in.\n\nThe sprint backlog is the property of the development team, and all included estimates are provided by the development team. Often an accompanying task board is used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint, like to do, in progress and done.\n\nOnce a sprint backlog is committed, no additional work can be added to the sprint backlog except by the team. Once a sprint has been delivered, the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary, and the next set of functionality is selected for the next sprint.\n\n=== Increment ===\n\nThe ''increment'' is the potentially releasable output of the sprint that meets the sprint goal. It is formed from all the completed sprint backlog items, integrated with the work of all previous sprints. The increment must be complete, according to the scrum team's ''definition of done'' (DoD), fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to actually deploy and use it.\n\n=== Extensions ===\n\nThe following artifacts and techniques can be used to help people use Scrum.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n==== Sprint burndown chart ====\n\n[[File:SampleBurndownChart.svg|thumb|A sample burndown chart for a completed sprint, showing remaining effort at the end of each day.]]\n\n{{main|Burn down chart}}\n\nThe sprint burndown chart is a publicly displayed chart showing remaining work in the sprint backlog.<ref name=\"Cobb2015\">{{cite book|author=Charles G. Cobb|title=The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHjTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA378|date=January 27, 2015|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-99104-6|page=378}}</ref> Updated every day, it gives a simple view of the sprint progress. It also provides quick visualizations for reference. The horizontal axis of the sprint burndown chart shows the days in a sprint, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work remaining each day (typically representing the estimate of hours of work remaining).\n\nDuring sprint planning, the ideal burndown chart is plotted. Then, during the sprint, each member picks up tasks from the sprint backlog and works on them. At the end of the day, they update the remaining hours for tasks to be completed. In such a way, the actual burndown chart is updated day by day.\n\nIt should not be confused with an [[earned value management|earned value chart]].\n\n==== Release burn-up chart ====\n\n[[File:SampleBurnupChart.png|thumb|A sample burn-up chart for a release, showing scope completed each sprint (MVP = Minimum Viable Product)]]\n\nThe release burn-up chart is a way for the team to provide visibility and track progress toward a release. Updated at the end of each sprint, it shows progress toward delivering a forecast scope. The horizontal axis of the release burn-up chart shows the sprints in a release, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work completed at the end of each sprint (typically representing cumulative story points of work completed). Progress is plotted as a line that grows up to meet a horizontal line that represents the forecast scope; often shown with a forecast, based on progress to date, that indicates how much scope might be completed by a given release date or how many sprints it will take to complete the given scope.\n\nThe release burn-up chart makes it easy to see how much work has been completed, how much work has been added or removed (if the horizontal scope line moves), and how much work is left to be done.\n\n==== Definition of ready (DoR) ====\nThe start criteria to determine whether the [[specification]]s and inputs are set enough to start the work item, i.e. a [[user story]].\n\n==== Definition of done (DoD) ====\nThe [[exit-criteria]] to determine whether a product backlog item is complete. In many cases, the DoD requires that all [[regression testing|regression tests]] be successful. The definition of done may vary from one scrum team to another but must be consistent within one team.<ref>Ken Schwaber, ''Agile Project Management with Scrum'', p.55</ref>\n\n==== Velocity ====\n\nThe total effort a team is capable of in a sprint. The number is derived by evaluating the work (typically in [[user story]] points) completed in the last sprint. The collection of historical velocity data is a guideline for assisting the team in understanding how much work they can likely achieve in a future sprint.\n\n==== Spike ====\n\nA time-boxed period used to research a concept or create a simple prototype. Spikes can either be planned to take place in between sprints or, for larger teams, a spike might be accepted as one of many sprint delivery objectives. Spikes are often introduced before the delivery of large or complex product backlog items in order to secure budget, expand knowledge, or produce a proof of concept. The duration and objective(s) of a spike is agreed between product owner and development team before the start. Unlike sprint commitments, spikes may or may not deliver tangible, shippable, valuable functionality. For example, the objective of a spike might be to successfully reach a decision on a course of action. The spike is over when the time is up, not necessarily when the objective has been delivered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html|title=Create a Spike Solution|publisher=Extreme Programming}}</ref>\n\n==== Tracer bullet ====\n\nAlso called a drone spike, a tracer bullet is a spike with the current architecture, current technology set, current set of best practices that result in production quality code. It might just be a very narrow implementation of the functionality but is not throwaway code. It is of production quality, and the rest of the iterations can build on this code. The name has military origins as [[Tracer ammunition|ammunition]] that makes the path of the bullet visible, allowing for corrections. Often these implementations are a 'quick shot' through all layers of an application, such as connecting a single form's input field to the back-end, to prove the layers connect as expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingagile.com/2007/10/22/research-spikes-tracer-bullets-oh-my/|title=Research, Spikes, Tracer Bullets, Oh My!|last=Sterling|first=Chris|date=October 22, 2007|website=Getting Agile|access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nThe benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve when:<ref>{{cite journal |title=Limitations of Agile Software Processes |journal=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Extreme Programming and Flexible Processes in Software Engineering |pages=43\u201346 |orig-year=2002 |arxiv=1409.6600v1 |last1=Turk |first1=Dan |last2=France |first2=Robert |last3=Rumpe |first3=Bernhard |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ijser.org/researchpaper/Issues-and-Challenges-in-Scrum-Implementation.pdf |title=Issues and Challenges in Scrum Implementation |journal=International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research |volume=3 |issue=8 |date=August 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* '''Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time''': In Scrum, developers should have close and ongoing interaction, ideally working together in the same space most of the time. While recent improvements in technology have reduced the impact of these barriers (e.g., being able to collaborate on a digital whiteboard), the Agile manifesto asserts that the best communication is face to face.<ref name=\"AgileManifesto\">{{cite web|url=http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html|title=Principles behind the Agile Manifesto |year=2001 |website=|publisher=Agile Alliance |author=[[Kent Beck]] |author2=James Grenning |author3=[[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C.

This can be encouraged by good Scrum leadership. While team members with very specific skills can and do contribute well, they should be encouraged to learn more about and collaborate with other disciplines.\n* '''Products with many external dependencies''': In Scrum, dividing product development into short sprints requires careful planning; external dependencies, such as [[user acceptance testing]] or coordination with other teams, can lead to delays and the failure of individual sprints.\n* '''Products that are [[Product life-cycle theory|mature]] or [[Legacy system|legacy]] or with regulated [[quality control]]''': In Scrum, product increments should be fully developed and tested in a single sprint; products that need large amounts of [[regression testing]] or safety testing (e.g., medical devices or vehicle control) for each release are less suited to short sprints than to longer [[waterfall model|waterfall]] releases.\n\nFrom a business perspective, Scrum has many virtues, one of which is that it is designed to yield the best business solutions. However, the efficiency by which it does so in any given organization can vary widely and is largely dependent on the ability of the organization to adhere to the implementation guidelines. Every company has its own distinct organizational structure, culture, and set of business practices, and some are more naturally amenable to this methodology than others.\n\n== Tools for implementation ==\n{{Main|Comparison of Scrum software}}\nLike other agile methods, effective adoption of Scrum can be supported through a wide range of tools.\n\nMany companies use universal tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are also open-source and proprietary software packages for Scrum\u2014which are either dedicated to product development using the Scrum framework or support multiple product development approaches including Scrum.\n\nOther organizations implement Scrum without software tools and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://targetprocess.com/download/whitepaper/agiletools.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agile Tools.

All work within the Scrum framework should be visible to those responsible for the outcome: the process, the workflow, progress, etc. In order to make these things visible, scrum teams need to frequently inspect the product being developed and how well the team is working. With frequent inspection, the team can spot when their work deviates outside of acceptable limits and adapt their process or the product under development.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Scrum: an ideal framework for agile projects|last=Morris|first=David|publisher=In Easy Steps|year=2017|isbn=9781840787313|location=|pages=178\u2013179|oclc=951453155}}</ref>\n\nThese three pillars require trust and openness in the team, which the following five values of Scrum enable:<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n# Commitment: Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every [[Sprint (software development)|sprint]].\n# Courage: Team members know they have the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing.\n# Focus: Team members focus exclusively on their team goals and the sprint backlog; there should be no work done other than through their backlog.\n# Openness: Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.\n# Respect: Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\nThe hybridization of Scrum with other software development methodologies is common as Scrum does not cover the whole [[software lifecycle|product development lifecycle]]; therefore, organizations find the need to add in additional processes to create a more comprehensive implementation. For example, at the start of product development, organizations commonly add process guidance on the business case, requirements gathering and prioritization, initial high-level design, and budget and schedule forecasting.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Hron, M. |author2=Obwegeser, N.|date=January 2018|title=Scrum in practice: an overview of Scrum adaptations|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/116906219/Hron_Obwegeser_Scrum_in_practice_An_overview_of_Scrum_adaptations.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 2018 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), January 3-6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nVarious authors and communities of people who use Scrum have also suggested more detailed techniques for how to apply or adapt Scrum to particular problems or organizations.

Scrumban is especially suited for [[Software maintenance|product maintenance]] with frequent and unexpected work items, such as [[Software bug|production defects]] or programming errors. In such cases the time-limited sprints of the Scrum framework may be perceived to be of less benefit, although Scrum's daily events and other practices can still be applied, depending on the team and the situation at hand. Visualization of the work stages and limitations for simultaneous unfinished work and defects are familiar from the Kanban model. Using these methods, the team's [[workflow]] is directed in a way that allows for minimum completion time for each work item or programming error, and on the other hand ensures each team member is constantly employed.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook|title=Kanban and Scrum - Making the most of both|last=Kniberg|first=Henrik|last2=Skarin|first2=Mattias|date=December 21, 2009 |website=|publisher=InfoQ|format=PDF|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTo illustrate each stage of work, teams working in the same space often use post-it notes or a large whiteboard.<ref name=\"scrumban\">{{cite web|url=http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/|title=scrum-ban|last=Ladas|first=Corey|date=October 27, 2007|publisher=Lean Software Engineering|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref> In the case of decentralized teams, stage-illustration software such as [[Assembla]], [[Jira (software)|JIRA]] or [[Agilo for Trac|Agilo]] can be used.\n\nThe major differences between Scrum and Kanban is that in Scrum work is divided into sprints that last a fixed amount of time, whereas in Kanban the flow of work is continuous. This is visible in work stage tables, which in Scrum are emptied after each sprint, whereas in Kanban all tasks are marked on the same table. Scrum focuses on teams with multifaceted know-how, whereas Kanban makes specialized, functional teams possible.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\" />\n\n=== Scrum of scrums ===\n\nThe scrum of scrums is a technique to operate Scrum at scale, for multiple teams working on the same product, allowing them to discuss progress on their interdependencies, focusing on how to coordinate delivering software,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" /> especially on areas of overlap and integration. Depending on the cadence (timing) of the scrum of scrums, the relevant daily scrum for each scrum team ends by designating one member as an ambassador to participate in the scrum of scrums with ambassadors from other teams. Depending on the context, the ambassadors may be technical contributors or each team's scrum master.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\">{{cite web |publisher=Agile Alliance |title=Scrum of Scrums |url=http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/scrumofscrums.html |date=December 17, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nRather than simply a progress update, the scrum of scrums should focus on how teams are collectively working to resolve, mitigate, or accept any risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions (RIDAs) that have been identified. The scrum of scrums tracks these RIDAs via a backlog of its own, such as a risk board (sometimes known as a ''ROAM board'' after the initials of resolved, owned, accepted, and mitigated),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutagile.com/risk-management-how-to-stop-risks-from-screwing-up-your-projects/ |title=Risk Management \u2013 How to Stop Risks from Screwing Up Your Projects!|publisher=Kelly Waters}}</ref> which typically leads to greater coordination and collaboration between teams.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\nThis should run similar to a daily scrum, with each ambassador answering the following four questions:<ref>{{cite web|title=Scrum of Scrums|url=http://scrummastertest.com/scrum-of-scrums/|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions has your team resolved since we last met?\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions will your team resolve before we meet again?\n* Are there any new risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions slowing your team down or getting in their way?\n* Are you about to introduce a new risk, impediment, dependency, or assumption that will get in another team's way?\n\nAs [[Jeff Sutherland]] commented,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\n<blockquote>Since I originally defined the Scrum of Scrums (Ken Schwaber was at IDX working with me), I can definitively say the Scrum of Scrums is not a 'meta Scrum'. The Scrum of Scrums as I have used it is responsible for delivering the working software of all teams to the Definition of Done at the end of the sprint, or for releases during the sprint. PatientKeeper delivered to production four times per Sprint. Ancestry.com delivers to production 220 times per two-week Sprint. Hubspot delivers live software 100-300 times a day. The Scrum of Scrums Master is held accountable for making this work. So the Scrum of Scrums is an operational delivery mechanism.</blockquote>\n\n===Large-scale Scrum===\nLarge-scale Scrum (LeSS) is a product development framework that extends Scrum with scaling rules and guidelines without losing the original purposes of Scrum.\n\nThere are two levels to the framework: the first LeSS level is designed for up to eight teams; the second level, known as 'LeSS Huge', introduces additional scaling elements for development with up to hundreds of developers. \"Scaling Scrum starts with understanding and being able to adopt standard real one-team Scrum. Large-scale Scrum requires examining the purpose of single-team Scrum elements and figuring out how to reach the same purpose while staying within the constraints of the standard Scrum rules.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larman |last2=scrumyear=2013 |title=Scaling Agile Development (Crosstalk journal, November / December 2013)|url=http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2013/201305/201305-larman.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBas Vodde and [[Craig Larman]] evolved the LeSS framework from their experiences working with large-scale product development, especially in the telecoms and finance industries. It evolved by taking Scrum and trying many different experiments to discover what works. In 2013, the experiments were solidified into the LeSS framework rules.<ref>{{cite web|year=2014 |title=Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)|url=http://less.works}}</ref> The intention of LeSS is to 'descale' organization complexity, dissolving unnecessary complex organizational solutions, and solving them in simpler ways.

Feodosia serves as the administrative center of [[Feodosia Municipality]], one of the regions into which Crimea is divided.

Noted for its rich agricultural lands, on which its trade depended, it was destroyed by the [[Huns]] in the 4th century AD.\n\nTheodosia remained a minor village for much of the next nine hundred years. It was at times part of the [[sphere of influence]] of the [[Khazars]] (excavations have revealed Khazar artifacts dating back to the 9th century) and of the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nLike the rest of [[Crimea]], this place (village) fell under the domination of the [[Kipchaks]] and was conquered by the [[Mongols]] in the 1230s.\n\n===Kaffa===<!-- This section is linked from [[Crimea]] -->\n[[File:Satellite picture of Crimea, Terra-MODIS, 05-16-2015.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Satellite image.

The [[papal bull]] of appointment of the first bishop attributed to him a vast territory: \"a villa de [[Varna]] in [[Bulgaria]] usque [[Sarai (city)|Sarey]] inclusive in longitudinem et a [[Black Sea|mari Pontico]] usque ad [[Ruthenia|terram Ruthenorum]] in latitudinem\" (\"from the city of Varna in Bulgaria to Sarey inclusive in longitude, and from the Black Sea to the land of the Ruthenians in latitude\"). The first bishop was Fra' Gerolamo, who had already been consecrated seven years before as a missionary bishop ''ad partes Tartarorum''. The diocese ended as a residential bishopric with the capture of the city by the [[Ottomans]] in 1475.<ref>Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&nbsp;432</ref><ref>Konrad Eubel, ''Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi'', [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002716&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 1], pp.&nbsp;154\u2013155; [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002717&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 2], pp.&nbsp;XVIII e 117; [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002718&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 3], p.&nbsp;145; [https://archive.org/stream/hierarchiacathol05eubeuoft#page/134/mode/1up vol. 5], p.&nbsp;134</ref><ref>Gasparo Luigi Oderico, [https://archive.org/details/lettereligustic00massgoog ''Lettere ligustiche ossia Osservazioni critiche sullo stato geografico della Liguria fino ai Tempi di Ottone il Grande, con le Memorie storiche di Caffa ed altri luoghi della Crimea posseduti un tempo da' Genovesi''], Bassano 1792 (especially p.&nbsp;166 ff.)</ref> Accordingly, Kaffa is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 855</ref>\n\nIt is believed that the devastating [[pandemic]] the [[Black Death]] entered Europe for the first time via Kaffa in 1347, through the movements of the Golden Horde. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army under [[Janibeg]] was reportedly withering from the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants, in one of the first cases of [[biological warfare]]. Fleeing inhabitants may have carried the disease back to Italy, causing its spread across Europe. However, the plague appears to have spread in a stepwise fashion, taking over a year to reach [[Europe]] from [[Crimea]]. Also, there were a number of Crimean ports under [[Mongols|Mongol]] control, so it is unlikely that Kaffa was the only source of plague-infested ships heading to Europe. Additionally, there were overland caravan routes from the East that would have been carrying the disease into Europe as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wheelis |first=Mark |date=September 2002 |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Kaffa |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971\u201375 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536 |pmid=12194776 |pmc=2732530}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Silk Roads|last=Frankopan|first=Peter|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183}}</ref>\n\nKaffa eventually recovered.

He was at no loss for a pretext to extinguish this last Genoese colony on the Black sea. In 1473, the ''tudun'' (or governor) of the [[Crimean Khanate]] died and a fight developed over the appointment of his successor. The Genoese involved themselves in the dispute, and the Tatar notables who favored the losing candidate finally asked Mehmed to settle the dispute. Mehmed dispatched a fleet under the Ottoman commander [[Gedik Ahmet Pasha]], which left [[Constantinople]] 19 May 1475. It anchored before the walls of the city on 1 June, started the bombardment the next day, and on 6 June the inhabitants capitulated. Over the next few days the Ottomans proceeded to extract the wealth of the inhabitants, and abduct 1,500 youths for service in the Sultan's palace.{{lopsided|date=April 2020}} On 8 July the final blow was struck when all inhabitants of Latin origin were ordered to relocate to  Istanbul, where they founded a quarter (''Kefeli Mahalle'') which was named after the town they had been forced to leave.<ref>Franz Babinger, ''Mehmed the Conqueror and his Time'' (Princeton: University Press, 1978), pp. 343ff.</ref> Renamed ''Kefe'', Caffa became one of the most important Turkish ports on the Black Sea.\n\nIn 1615 [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] under the leadership of [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] destroyed the Turkish fleet and captured Caffa.

Theodosia.jpg|thumb|View from Tepe-Oba over Ordzhonikidze (Urban-type settlement under the town's jurisdiction)]]\n\nModern Feodosiya is a resort city with a population of about 69,000 people. It has beaches, mineral springs, and mud baths, sanatoria, and rest homes. Apart from tourism, its economy rests on agriculture and fisheries. Local industries include fishing, brewing and canning. As with much of the Crimea, most of its population is ethnically [[Russians|Russian]]; the [[Ukrainian language]] is infrequently used. In June 2006, Feodosiya made the news with the [[2006 port riot in Feodosiya|2006 anti-NATO port riot]].\n\nWhile most beaches in Crimea are made of pebbles, there is a unique Golden Beach (Zolotoy Plyazh) made of small seashells in the Feodosiya area. The Golden Beach stretches for 15&nbsp;km.\n\nThe city is sparsely populated during the winter months. Most cafes and restaurants are closed. Business and tourism increase in mid-June and peak during July and August. Like in the other [[resort town]]s in Crimea, the tourists come mostly from the [[C.I.S.]] countries of the former Soviet Union. Feodosiya was the city where the seascape painter [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] lived and worked all his life, and where general [[Pyotr Kotlyarevsky]] and the writer [[Alexander Grin]] spent their declining years. Popular tourist locations include the [[Aivazovsky National Art Gallery]] and the Genoese fortress.\n\n=== 2014 Russian annexation ===\n{{main|Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation}}\nFeodosia, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] <nowiki/>territory since 1991, was annexed by [[Russia]] in early 2014. The international community has overwhelmingly condemned the Russian Federation's acts in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.

The United Nations also called upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n*[[More (Feodosiya)|More PO]] (Primorsk)\n*Sudokompozit - ship design R&D naval hardware\n: Kasatka TsNII Gp NPO Uran (Gagra Pitsunda) - ship design R&D naval hardware\n*Gidropribor FeOMMZ, torpedo manufacturing and ship yard (Ordzhonikidze)\n: NPO Uran TsNII Gp \"Kasatka\" (Lab N\u00b05 NII400) torpedoes (Gagra Pitsunda)\n*Russia Black Sea Fleet Navy Ship repair Yards\n*FOMZ Opto Mechanical Plant FKOZ\n*Feodosia Economic Industrial Zone FPZ (west)\n*Feodosia FMZ Engineering/Machine-building Plant\n*Feodosia FPZ (Priborostroeni Priladobudivni) Instrument-making Plant\n\n==Twin towns\u2014sister cities==\n*{{Flagicon|Armenia}} [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], [[Armenia]]\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Azov]], [[Russia]]\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Kronstadt]], [[Russia]]\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Stavropol]], [[Russia]]\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]], [[Poland]]\n*and others <!-- see ru.wikipedia -->\n\n==People from Feodosiya==\n*[[Ivan Aivazovsky]] (1817-1900), Russian painter\n*[[Roman Kapitonenko]] (born 1981), Ukrainian boxer\n*[[Andrzej Liczik]] (born 1977), Ukrainian-Polish boxer\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe late-medieval city of Caffa is the locale in a section of the novel ''Caprice and Rondo'' by [[Dorothy Dunnett]].\n\nAn early 14th-century bishop of Caffa appears in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', making several sharp replies in a long, tempestuous debate within a group of monks and clerics; he is portrayed as aggressive and somewhat narrow-minded.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of traditional Greek place names]]\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:\u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430 03.JPG|View from Tepe-Oba\nFile:\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430 01.JPG|Ancient [[Crimean Karaites|Karaites]] cemetery\nFile:Theodosia_castle.JPG|Genoese castle Caffa\nFile:\u0412\u0438\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u0437 \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430.JPG|Port and Tepe-Oba\nFile:\u041c\u0430\u044f\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u0441\u0456 \u0406\u043b\u043b\u0456-\u043f\u0456\u0432\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u043a\u0456\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430.jpg|Lighthouse on Tepe-Oba\nFile:\u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0438\u044f-001.jpg|Feodosia downtown\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |publisher = Hurst and Blackett |location = London |author= Annette M.

Feodosia serves as the administrative center of [[Feodosia Municipality]], one of the regions into which Crimea is divided. During much of its history the city was known as '''Caffa''' ([[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]]: ''Caf\u00e0'') or '''Kaffa'''.

Noted for its rich agricultural lands, on which its trade depended, it was destroyed by the [[Huns]] in the 4th century AD.\n\nTheodosia remained a minor village for much of the next nine hundred years. It was at times part of the [[sphere of influence]] of the [[Khazars]] (excavations have revealed Khazar artifacts dating back to the 9th century) and of the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nLike the rest of [[Crimea]], this place (village) fell under the domination of the [[Kipchaks]] and was conquered by the [[Mongols]] in the 1230s.\n\n===Kaffa===<!-- This section is linked from [[Crimea]] -->\n[[File:Satellite picture of Crimea, Terra-MODIS, 05-16-2015.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Satellite image.

It came to house one of Europe's biggest [[Slavery|slave markets]]. The [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] also adds that the city of Caffa was established during the times when the area was ruled by the Khan of Golden Horde [[Mengu-Timur]].<ref>[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article075451.html Mengu-Timur (\u041c\u0435\u043d\u0433\u0443-\u0422\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0440)].

The [[papal bull]] of appointment of the first bishop attributed to him a vast territory: \"a villa de [[Varna]] in [[Bulgaria]] usque [[Sarai (city)|Sarey]] inclusive in longitudinem et a [[Black Sea|mari Pontico]] usque ad [[Ruthenia|terram Ruthenorum]] in latitudinem\" (\"from the city of Varna in Bulgaria to Sarey inclusive in longitude, and from the Black Sea to the land of the Ruthenians in latitude\"). The first bishop was Fra' Gerolamo, who had already been consecrated seven years before as a missionary bishop ''ad partes Tartarorum''. The diocese ended as a residential bishopric with the capture of the city by the [[Ottomans]] in 1475.<ref>Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&nbsp;432</ref><ref>Konrad Eubel, ''Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi'', [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002716&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 1], pp.&nbsp;154\u2013155; [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002717&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 2], pp.&nbsp;XVIII e 117; [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002718&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 3], p.&nbsp;145; [https://archive.org/stream/hierarchiacathol05eubeuoft#page/134/mode/1up vol. 5], p.&nbsp;134</ref><ref>Gasparo Luigi Oderico, [https://archive.org/details/lettereligustic00massgoog ''Lettere ligustiche ossia Osservazioni critiche sullo stato geografico della Liguria fino ai Tempi di Ottone il Grande, con le Memorie storiche di Caffa ed altri luoghi della Crimea posseduti un tempo da' Genovesi''], Bassano 1792 (especially p.&nbsp;166 ff.)</ref> Accordingly, Kaffa is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 855</ref>\n\nIt is believed that the devastating [[pandemic]] the [[Black Death]] entered Europe for the first time via Kaffa in 1347, through the movements of the Golden Horde. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army under [[Janibeg]] was reportedly withering from the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants, in one of the first cases of [[biological warfare]]. Fleeing inhabitants may have carried the disease back to Italy, causing its spread across Europe. However, the plague appears to have spread in a stepwise fashion, taking over a year to reach [[Europe]] from [[Crimea]]. Also, there were a number of Crimean ports under [[Mongols|Mongol]] control, so it is unlikely that Kaffa was the only source of plague-infested ships heading to Europe. Additionally, there were overland caravan routes from the East that would have been carrying the disease into Europe as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wheelis |first=Mark |date=September 2002 |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Kaffa |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971\u201375 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536 |pmid=12194776 |pmc=2732530}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Silk Roads|last=Frankopan|first=Peter|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183}}</ref>\n\nKaffa eventually recovered.

He was at no loss for a pretext to extinguish this last Genoese colony on the Black sea. In 1473, the ''tudun'' (or governor) of the [[Crimean Khanate]] died and a fight developed over the appointment of his successor. The Genoese involved themselves in the dispute, and the Tatar notables who favored the losing candidate finally asked Mehmed to settle the dispute. Mehmed dispatched a fleet under the Ottoman commander [[Gedik Ahmet Pasha]], which left [[Constantinople]] 19 May 1475. It anchored before the walls of the city on 1 June, started the bombardment the next day, and on 6 June the inhabitants capitulated. Over the next few days the Ottomans proceeded to extract the wealth of the inhabitants, and abduct 1,500 youths for service in the Sultan's palace.{{lopsided|date=April 2020}} On 8 July the final blow was struck when all inhabitants of Latin origin were ordered to relocate to  Istanbul, where they founded a quarter (''Kefeli Mahalle'') which was named after the town they had been forced to leave.<ref>Franz Babinger, ''Mehmed the Conqueror and his Time'' (Princeton: University Press, 1978), pp. 343ff.</ref> Renamed ''Kefe'', Caffa became one of the most important Turkish ports on the Black Sea.\n\nIn 1615 [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] under the leadership of [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] destroyed the Turkish fleet and captured Caffa. Having conquered the city, the cossacks released the men, women and children who were slaves.\n\n===Feodosia again===\nOttoman control ceased when the expanding [[Russian Empire]] took over Crimea between 1774 and 1783.

Theodosia.jpg|thumb|View from Tepe-Oba over Ordzhonikidze (Urban-type settlement under the town's jurisdiction)]]\n\nModern Feodosiya is a resort city with a population of about 69,000 people. It has beaches, mineral springs, and mud baths, sanatoria, and rest homes. Apart from tourism, its economy rests on agriculture and fisheries. Local industries include fishing, brewing and canning. As with much of the Crimea, most of its population is ethnically [[Russians|Russian]]; the [[Ukrainian language]] is infrequently used. In June 2006, Feodosiya made the news with the [[2006 port riot in Feodosiya|2006 anti-NATO port riot]].\n\nWhile most beaches in Crimea are made of pebbles, there is a unique Golden Beach (Zolotoy Plyazh) made of small seashells in the Feodosiya area. The Golden Beach stretches for 15&nbsp;km.\n\nThe city is sparsely populated during the winter months. Most cafes and restaurants are closed. Business and tourism increase in mid-June and peak during July and August. Like in the other [[resort town]]s in Crimea, the tourists come mostly from the [[C.I.S.]] countries of the former Soviet Union. Feodosiya was the city where the seascape painter [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] lived and worked all his life, and where general [[Pyotr Kotlyarevsky]] and the writer [[Alexander Grin]] spent their declining years. Popular tourist locations include the [[Aivazovsky National Art Gallery]] and the Genoese fortress.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n*[[More (Feodosiya)|More PO]] (Primorsk)\n*Sudokompozit - ship design R&D naval hardware\n: Kasatka TsNII Gp NPO Uran (Gagra Pitsunda) - ship design R&D naval hardware\n*Gidropribor FeOMMZ, torpedo manufacturing and ship yard (Ordzhonikidze)\n: NPO Uran TsNII Gp \"Kasatka\" (Lab N\u00b05 NII400) torpedoes (Gagra Pitsunda)\n*Russia Black Sea Fleet Navy Ship repair Yards\n*FOMZ Opto Mechanical Plant FKOZ\n*Feodosia Economic Industrial Zone FPZ (west)\n*Feodosia FMZ Engineering/Machine-building Plant\n*Feodosia FPZ (Priborostroeni Priladobudivni) Instrument-making Plant\n\n==Twin towns\u2014sister cities==\n*{{Flagicon|Armenia}} [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], [[Armenia]]\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Azov]], [[Russia]]\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Kronstadt]], [[Russia]]\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Stavropol]], [[Russia]]\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]], [[Poland]]\n*and others <!-- see ru.wikipedia -->\n\n==People from Feodosiya==\n*[[Ivan Aivazovsky]] (1817-1900), Russian painter\n*[[Roman Kapitonenko]] (born 1981), Ukrainian boxer\n*[[Andrzej Liczik]] (born 1977), Ukrainian-Polish boxer\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe late-medieval city of Caffa is the locale in a section of the novel ''Caprice and Rondo'' by [[Dorothy Dunnett]].\n\nAn early 14th-century bishop of Caffa appears in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', making several sharp replies in a long, tempestuous debate within a group of monks and clerics; he is portrayed as aggressive and somewhat narrow-minded.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of traditional Greek place names]]\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:\u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430 03.JPG|View from Tepe-Oba\nFile:\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430 01.JPG|Ancient [[Crimean Karaites|Karaites]] cemetery\nFile:Theodosia_castle.JPG|Genoese castle Caffa\nFile:\u0412\u0438\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u0437 \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430.JPG|Port and Tepe-Oba\nFile:\u041c\u0430\u044f\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u0441\u0456 \u0406\u043b\u043b\u0456-\u043f\u0456\u0432\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u043a\u0456\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430.jpg|Lighthouse on Tepe-Oba\nFile:\u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0438\u044f-001.jpg|Feodosia downtown\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |publisher = Hurst and Blackett |location = London |author= Annette M.

Newborns with [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]] often also have a split uvula. The bifid uvula results from incomplete fusion of the palatine shelves but it is considered only a slight form of clefting. Bifid uvulas have less muscle in them than a normal uvula, which may cause recurring problems with middle ear infections. While swallowing, the soft palate is pushed backwards, preventing food and drink from entering the nasal cavity. If the soft palate cannot touch the back of the throat while swallowing, food and drink can enter the nasal cavity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.ivillage.com/dental/0,,6hlv,00.html |title=Split Uvula: Is It a Problem? |accessdate=23 September 2007 |website=}}</ref> Splitting of the uvula occurs infrequently but is the most common form of mouth and nose area cleavage among newborns.

In many languages, the uvula is used to articulate a range of consonant sounds, known as [[uvular consonants]]. The [[voiced uvular trill]], written {{IPA|[\u0280]}} in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], is one example; it is used in [[French language|French]], [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]], among other languages. Due to the large amount of saliva produced from glands in the uvula that are not present in other mammals it has been suggested that the uvula is an accessory speech organ.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Finkelstein Y, Meshorer A, Talmi Y, Zohar Y, Brenner J, Gal R | title = The riddle of the uvula. | journal = Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 444\u201350 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1408233 | doi = 10.1177/019459989210700318}}</ref>\n\nStimulation of the uvula also causes the [[gag reflex]] to initiate. This is often a problem for people with [[uvula piercing]]s, and a common method of inducing vomiting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Inflammation===\n[[File:Swollen Uvula.jpg|thumb|340x340px|A swollen uvula with additional upper mouth ulcer in a run-down adult (common cold)]]\nAt times, the [[mucous membrane]] around the uvula may [[Swelling (medical)|swell]], causing the uvula to expand 3\u20135 times its normal size. This condition is known as uvulitis. When the uvula touches the throat or tongue, it can cause sensations like gagging or choking, although there is no foreign matter present.  This can cause problems with breathing, talking, and eating.\n\nThere are many theories about what causes the uvula to swell, including [[dehydration]] (e.g. from arid weather); excessive [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] or other inhaled irritants; [[snoring]]; [[allergic reaction]]; or a [[virus|viral]] or [[bacterial infection]]. An [[aphthous ulcer]] which has formed on the uvula can also cause swelling and discomfort.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Biblo LA, Gilbert IA|date=May 1983|title=Aphthous ulcer of the uvula and the painful burp|journal=N. Engl. J. Med.|volume=308|issue=19|pages=1168|doi=10.1056/NEJM198305123081922|pmid=6835348}}</ref>\n\nIf the swelling is caused by dehydration, drinking fluids may improve the condition. If the cause is a bacterial infection, [[gargling]] salt water may help.  However, it can also be a sign of other problems.  Some people with a history of recurring uvulitis carry an [[epinephrine autoinjector]] to counteract symptoms of an attack. A swollen uvula is not normally life-threatening and subsides in a short time, typically within a day.\n\n===Snoring and sleep apnea===\nThe uvula can also contribute to [[snoring]] or heavy breathing during sleep; having an elongated uvula can cause vibrations that lead to snoring.

Newborns with [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]] often also have a split uvula. The bifid uvula results from incomplete fusion of the palatine shelves but it is considered only a slight form of clefting. Bifid uvulas have less muscle in them than a normal uvula, which may cause recurring problems with middle ear infections. While swallowing, the soft palate is pushed backwards, preventing food and drink from entering the nasal cavity. If the soft palate cannot touch the back of the throat while swallowing, food and drink can enter the nasal cavity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.ivillage.com/dental/0,,6hlv,00.html |title=Split Uvula: Is It a Problem? |accessdate=23 September 2007 |website=}}</ref> Splitting of the uvula occurs infrequently but is the most common form of mouth and nose area cleavage among newborns.

In many languages, the uvula is used to articulate a range of consonant sounds, known as [[uvular consonants]]. The [[voiced uvular trill]], written {{IPA|[\u0280]}} in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], is one example; it is used in [[French language|French]], [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]], among other languages. Due to the large amount of saliva produced from glands in the uvula that are not present in other mammals it has been suggested that the uvula is an accessory speech organ.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Finkelstein Y, Meshorer A, Talmi Y, Zohar Y, Brenner J, Gal R | title = The riddle of the uvula. | journal = Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 444\u201350 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1408233 | doi = 10.1177/019459989210700318}}</ref>\n\nStimulation of the uvula also causes the [[gag reflex]] to initiate. This is often a problem for people with [[uvula piercing]]s, and a common method of inducing vomiting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Inflammation===\n[[File:Swollen Uvula.jpg|thumb|340x340px|A swollen uvula with additional upper mouth ulcer in a run-down adult (common cold)]]\nAt times, the [[mucous membrane]] around the uvula may [[Swelling (medical)|swell]], causing the uvula to expand 3\u20135 times its normal size. This condition is known as uvulitis. When the uvula touches the throat or tongue, it can cause sensations like gagging or choking, although there is no foreign matter present.  This can cause problems with breathing, talking, and eating.\n\nThere are many theories about what causes the uvula to swell, including [[dehydration]] (e.g. from arid weather); excessive [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] or other inhaled irritants; [[snoring]]; [[allergic reaction]]; or a [[virus|viral]] or [[bacterial infection]]. An [[aphthous ulcer]] which has formed on the uvula can also cause swelling and discomfort.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Biblo LA, Gilbert IA|date=May 1983|title=Aphthous ulcer of the uvula and the painful burp|journal=N.

If the cause is a bacterial infection, [[gargling]] salt water may help.  However, it can also be a sign of other problems.  Some people with a history of recurring uvulitis carry an [[epinephrine autoinjector]] to counteract symptoms of an attack. A swollen uvula is not normally life-threatening and subsides in a short time, typically within a day.\n\n===Snoring and sleep apnea===\nThe uvula can also contribute to [[snoring]] or heavy breathing during sleep; having an elongated uvula can cause vibrations that lead to snoring. In some cases this can lead to [[sleep apnea]], which may be treated by removal of the uvula or part of it if necessary, an operation known as [[uvulopalatopharyngoplasty]] (commonly referred to as UPPP, or UP3). However, this operation can also cause sleep apnea if [[scar]] tissue forms and the airspace in the velopharynx is decreased.

New equipment was brought into the country from overseas. Two additional laboratories began testing for the virus in mid-April: the [[Enfer]] facility in [[Sallins]], [[County Kildare]], and the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine]]'s laboratory in [[Backweston]].

Created in 1990, it was the longest and richest of all the international events organized by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball]] (FIVB). The women's version of the competition was called [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix]]. This event should not be confused with the other international volleyball competitions, the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|World Championship]], the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Champions Cup|World Grand Champions Cup]]. \n\nFrom 2018, the World League and World Grand Prix was replaced by the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's Nations League|men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League|women's]] Nations League and [[FIVB Volleyball Men's Challenger Cup|men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's Challenger Cup|women's]] Challenger Cup.<ref>[http://www.worldofvolley.com/News/Latest_news/FIVB/85965/fivb-drastically-changes-format-for-2018-world-league-and-grand-prix-italy-remain-member-of-elite.html FIVB drastically changes format for 2018 World League and Grand Prix] \u2013 World of Volley, 19 June 2017</ref><ref>[http://www.fivb.org/viewPressRelease.asp?No=73085&Language=en FIVB announces the Volleyball Nations League]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:WorldLeagueLogo.png|thumb|150px|right|First FIVB World League logo]]\n[[File:VolleyballWL newlogo.PNG|thumb|150px|right|Second FIVB World League logo]]\n\nThe World League was created in 1990 as part of the intensive marketing programme that would become a distinctive mark of the [[FIVB]]'s activities near the end of the century. The idea was to promote the [[sport]] of volleyball by establishing an annual competition that would appeal to audiences all over the world.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Winners===\nIn the 1990s, the [[Italy|Italians]] dominated the World League, winning the first three tournaments in 1990, 1991 and 1992. Playing at home, [[Brazil]], at the time the Olympic champions, managed to take the gold in 1993, but Italy regained the title in 1994 and 1995.\n\nIn 1996, foreshadowing what would happen just a couple of months later at the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Olympic Games]], the [[Netherlands]] beat them in an extremely tight five-set match, before Italy once again won the gold in 1997. In 1998, the winners were [[Cuba]], while in 1999 and 2000 Italy won again.\n\nAs can be seen, Italy were clearly the dominant team in the first decade of the World League: from 1990 to 2000, the World League was played 11 times, and Italy took gold eight times, while the remaining three titles were won by three different teams.\n\nItaly's supremacy in the World League began to wane in 2001, when Brazil won a second gold medal, beating the Italians in three straight sets. With further titles each year from 2003 to 2007, and winning another titles in 2009 and 2010, the Brazilians were the preeminent at the start of the 21st century, being also World and Olympic Champions. The interruptions to Brazil's dominance came in 2002, when Russia took the title, and in 2008, with the [[United States of America|United States]] winning gold and gaining positive momentum going into the [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]].\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe [[FIVB]] is constantly adapting the World League's competition formula to improve competitiveness and to make the games more attractive to the audience. Nevertheless, a few basic rules and restrictions will probably remain unchanged in the following years.\n\n*Teams who participate must provide local media coverage and live TV broadcasting.\n*The competition is divided in at least two phases: a preliminary round (usually called \"Intercontinental Round\"), with a system of rotating host cities; and one or more final rounds, with one or more host nations.\n*In the preliminary round, teams are organized in pools. Each team plays a total of four matches against all other teams in its pool, two at home, two as visitors. Each pair of matches is played over a weekend.\n*When all the matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top ''n'' teams in each pool qualify for the final round(s), and the remaining ones leave the competition. The value of ''n'' depends on the number of participating teams and the format that will be employed in the finals.\n*Host nation(s) automatically qualify for the final round(s).\n*The FIVB has tried various formats for the final round(s): Top Six, Top Four, Quarter-Semi-finals (Olympic format). For some years now (2004), the most commonly used is a mixed format: quarterfinalists are organized in two pools, and the top two teams in each pool play semifinals and finals according to the Olympic format.\n*In the preliminary round, a team is usually given the right to work with a list of nineteen players, from which the coach builds the fourteen-player line-up included two liberos (if the team include only one libero in the roster, their max roster number is limited to 12) that will be employed in a particular weekend. For the final round(s), only fourteen players included two liberos are allowed.\n\n==Hosts==\nList of hosts by number of final round championships hosted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"\n!Times hosted\n!Hosts\n!Year(s)\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|6||{{ITA}}||[[1991 FIVB Volleyball World League|1991]], [[1992 FIVB Volleyball World League|1992]],  [[1994 FIVB Volleyball World League|1994]], [[1998 FIVB Volleyball World League|1998]], [[2004 FIVB Volleyball World League|2004]], [[2014 FIVB Volleyball World League|2014]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|6||{{BRA}}||[[1993 FIVB Volleyball World League|1993]], [[1995 FIVB Volleyball World League|1995]],  [[2002 FIVB Volleyball World League|2002]], [[2008 FIVB Volleyball World League|2008]], [[2015 FIVB Volleyball World League|2015]], [[2017 FIVB Volleyball World League|2017]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|4||{{POL}}||[[2001 FIVB Volleyball World League|2001]], [[2007 FIVB Volleyball World League|2007]],  [[2011 FIVB Volleyball World League|2011]], [[2016 FIVB Volleyball World League|2016]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|3||{{ARG}}||[[1999 FIVB Volleyball World League|1999]], [[2010 FIVB Volleyball World League|2010]],  [[2013 FIVB Volleyball World League|2013]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2||{{NED}}||[[1996 FIVB Volleyball World League|1996]], [[2000 FIVB Volleyball World League|2000]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2||{{RUS}}||[[1997 FIVB Volleyball World League|1997]], [[2006 FIVB Volleyball World League|2006]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2||{{SRB}}||[[2005 FIVB Volleyball World League|2005]], [[2009 FIVB Volleyball World League|2009]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1||{{JPN}}||[[1990 FIVB Volleyball World League|1990]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1||{{ESP}}||[[2003 FIVB Volleyball World League|2003]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1||{{BUL}}||[[2012 FIVB Volleyball World League|2012]]\n|}\n\n==Appearance==\n[[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] are the only teams that participated in all editions of the World League.\n\n{{legend4|#BBF3BB|Team last allocated in Group 1}}\n{{legend4|#BBF3FF|Team last allocated in Group 2}}\n{{legend4|#FFFFBB|Team last allocated in Group 3}}\n{{legend4|#FFFFFF|Team was inactive in the last World League}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team\n! colspan=\"3\"|Intercontinental Round\n! colspan=\"3\"|Final Round{{efn-ua|name=FinalRound|Since Group system was introduced in 2014, statistics of only Group 1 Final Round are included, as this is the medal round.}}\n|-\n! {{Tooltip|App.|Total Appearances In World League}}\n!

Created in 1990, it was the longest and richest of all the international events organized by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball]] (FIVB). The women's version of the competition was called [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix]]. This event should not be confused with the other international volleyball competitions, the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|World Championship]], the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Champions Cup|World Grand Champions Cup]]. \n\nFrom 2018, the World League and World Grand Prix was replaced by the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's Nations League|men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League|women's]] Nations League and [[FIVB Volleyball Men's Challenger Cup|men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's Challenger Cup|women's]] Challenger Cup.<ref>[http://www.worldofvolley.com/News/Latest_news/FIVB/85965/fivb-drastically-changes-format-for-2018-world-league-and-grand-prix-italy-remain-member-of-elite.html FIVB drastically changes format for 2018 World League and Grand Prix] \u2013 World of Volley, 19 June 2017</ref><ref>[http://www.fivb.org/viewPressRelease.asp?No=73085&Language=en FIVB announces the Volleyball Nations League]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:WorldLeagueLogo.png|thumb|150px|right|First FIVB World League logo]]\n[[File:VolleyballWL newlogo.PNG|thumb|150px|right|Second FIVB World League logo]]\n\nThe World League was created in 1990 as part of the intensive marketing programme that would become a distinctive mark of the [[FIVB]]'s activities near the end of the century. The idea was to promote the [[sport]] of volleyball by establishing an annual competition that would appeal to audiences all over the world.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Winners===\nIn the 1990s, the [[Italy|Italians]] dominated the World League, winning the first three tournaments in 1990, 1991 and 1992. Playing at home, [[Brazil]], at the time the Olympic champions, managed to take the gold in 1993, but Italy regained the title in 1994 and 1995.\n\nIn 1996, foreshadowing what would happen just a couple of months later at the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Olympic Games]], the [[Netherlands]] beat them in an extremely tight five-set match, before Italy once again won the gold in 1997. In 1998, the winners were [[Cuba]], while in 1999 and 2000 Italy won again.\n\nAs can be seen, Italy were clearly the dominant team in the first decade of the World League: from 1990 to 2000, the World League was played 11 times, and Italy took gold eight times, while the remaining three titles were won by three different teams.\n\nItaly's supremacy in the World League began to wane in 2001, when Brazil won a second gold medal, beating the Italians in three straight sets. With further titles each year from 2003 to 2007, and winning another titles in 2009 and 2010, the Brazilians were the preeminent at the start of the 21st century, being also World and Olympic Champions. The interruptions to Brazil's dominance came in 2002, when Russia took the title, and in 2008, with the [[United States of America|United States]] winning gold and gaining positive momentum going into the [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]].\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe [[FIVB]] is constantly adapting the World League's competition formula to improve competitiveness and to make the games more attractive to the audience. Nevertheless, a few basic rules and restrictions will probably remain unchanged in the following years.\n\n*Teams who participate must provide local media coverage and live TV broadcasting.\n*The competition is divided in at least two phases: a preliminary round (usually called \"Intercontinental Round\"), with a system of rotating host cities; and one or more final rounds, with one or more host nations.\n*In the preliminary round, teams are organized in pools. Each team plays a total of four matches against all other teams in its pool, two at home, two as visitors. Each pair of matches is played over a weekend.\n*When all the matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top ''n'' teams in each pool qualify for the final round(s), and the remaining ones leave the competition. The value of ''n'' depends on the number of participating teams and the format that will be employed in the finals.\n*Host nation(s) automatically qualify for the final round(s).\n*The FIVB has tried various formats for the final round(s): Top Six, Top Four, Quarter-Semi-finals (Olympic format). For some years now (2004), the most commonly used is a mixed format: quarterfinalists are organized in two pools, and the top two teams in each pool play semifinals and finals according to the Olympic format.\n*In the preliminary round, a team is usually given the right to work with a list of nineteen players, from which the coach builds the fourteen-player line-up included two liberos (if the team include only one libero in the roster, their max roster number is limited to 12) that will be employed in a particular weekend. For the final round(s), only fourteen players included two liberos are allowed.\n\n==Hosts==\nList of hosts by number of final round championships hosted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"\n!Times hosted\n!Hosts\n!Year(s)\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|6||{{ITA}}||[[1991 FIVB Volleyball World League|1991]], [[1992 FIVB Volleyball World League|1992]],  [[1994 FIVB Volleyball World League|1994]], [[1998 FIVB Volleyball World League|1998]], [[2004 FIVB Volleyball World League|2004]], [[2014 FIVB Volleyball World League|2014]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|6||{{BRA}}||[[1993 FIVB Volleyball World League|1993]], [[1995 FIVB Volleyball World League|1995]],  [[2002 FIVB Volleyball World League|2002]], [[2008 FIVB Volleyball World League|2008]], [[2015 FIVB Volleyball World League|2015]], [[2017 FIVB Volleyball World League|2017]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|4||{{POL}}||[[2001 FIVB Volleyball World League|2001]], [[2007 FIVB Volleyball World League|2007]],  [[2011 FIVB Volleyball World League|2011]], [[2016 FIVB Volleyball World League|2016]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|3||{{ARG}}||[[1999 FIVB Volleyball World League|1999]], [[2010 FIVB Volleyball World League|2010]],  [[2013 FIVB Volleyball World League|2013]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2||{{NED}}||[[1996 FIVB Volleyball World League|1996]], [[2000 FIVB Volleyball World League|2000]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2||{{RUS}}||[[1997 FIVB Volleyball World League|1997]], [[2006 FIVB Volleyball World League|2006]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2||{{SRB}}||[[2005 FIVB Volleyball World League|2005]], [[2009 FIVB Volleyball World League|2009]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1||{{JPN}}||[[1990 FIVB Volleyball World League|1990]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1||{{ESP}}||[[2003 FIVB Volleyball World League|2003]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1||{{BUL}}||[[2012 FIVB Volleyball World League|2012]]\n|}\n\n==Appearance==\n[[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] are the only teams that participated in all editions of the World League.\n\n{{legend4|#BBF3BB|Team last allocated in Group 1}}\n{{legend4|#BBF3FF|Team last allocated in Group 2}}\n{{legend4|#FFFFBB|Team last allocated in Group 3}}\n{{legend4|#FFFFFF|Team was inactive in the last World League}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team\n! colspan=\"3\"|Intercontinental Round\n! colspan=\"3\"|Final Round{{efn-ua|name=FinalRound|Since Group system was introduced in 2014, statistics of only Group 1 Final Round are included, as this is the medal round.}}\n|-\n! {{Tooltip|App.|Total Appearances In World League}}\n!
