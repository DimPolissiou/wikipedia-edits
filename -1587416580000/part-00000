/>\n}}\n\n'''''Plants vs. Zombies''''' is a [[tower defense]] and [[strategy]] [[video game]] developed and originally published by [[PopCap Games]] for [[Windows]] and [[OS X]] in May 2009, and ported to consoles, handhelds, and mobile devices, and in remastered versions for personal computers.\n\nIn ''Plants vs. Zombies'', the player takes the role of a homeowner in the midst of a [[zombie apocalypse]]. To defend their home from zombies, some of which have unique abilities, the player uses plants that can fire projectiles at, or have other detrimental effects on, the horde of advancing zombies. The player collects \"sun\" with which defending plants can be bought. Zombies approach along several parallel lanes on the lawn, and the player must plan defenses in these lanes. If a zombie makes it to the house on any lane, the game is over. \n\nDirector George Fan was inspired to make the game after playing other tower defense titles and desiring to eliminate the typical strategies of sending advancing enemies through mazes of defenses, instead adapting the lane approach to remove this strategy.\n\nThe game received a positive response from critics and was nominated for multiple [[Interactive Achievement Award]]s, alongside receiving praise for its musical score. It was followed by one direct sequel and another made for mobile devices, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time]],'' released in 2013 for iOS and Android, and Plants vs. Zombies 3 respectively; two third-person shooters, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare]]'' and [[Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2|its sequel]], and a digital collectible card game, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies Heroes]]''. On October 18, 2019, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville]]'' was also released. On February 25, 2020, Plants vs. Zombies 3 was soft-launched.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Plants vs Zombies Gameplay.png|thumb|200px|left|Game in progress]]\n\nIn ''Plants vs. Zombies'', players place different types of plants and fungi, each with their own unique offensive or defensive capabilities, around their house, in order to stop a horde of [[zombie (fictional)|zombies]] from reaching it. The playing field is divided into 5 to 6 horizontal lanes, each with lawnmowers, and with rare exceptions, a zombie will move towards the player's house along one lane only (the main exception is if it has bitten garlic, causing it to move to another lane). Planting costs \"sun\", which can be gathered for free (albeit slowly) during daytime levels and by planting certain plants or fungi. Most plants can attack or defend against zombies in the lane they are planted in only. In later levels, players can purchase upgrades with different offensive and defensive abilities.\n\nThe game uses several different level types and layouts, each with their own gimmick. The game starts out in a front yard (the standard) and progresses to nighttime levels (sun won't be able to be gathered for free), where the gameplay is more challenging without any replenishing sun unless specific plants are used. Other levels feature the backyard, with a pool added (in general more to cost). Later levels are nighttime pool levels (where fog fills the right half of the screen except when specific plants are used), a lightning storm level in pitch black (except when illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning), and rooftop levels (where a slanted roof renders most offensive plants useless). On the final level, the player must face a huge robot operated by a zombie who takes the form of a mad scientist known as [[#Dr. Zomboss|Dr. Zomboss]]. At set points throughout the game, the player is either warned through a letter by zombies or addressed by their neighbor, [[#Crazy Dave|Crazy Dave]], to prepare for an ambush, where the game takes on a bowling style, using Wall-nuts to bowl down zombies, or a modified version of regular levels, where random plant types come upon a conveyor belt, and the player can use the plants without spending sun.\n\nThe player starts with a limited number of seed pack types and seed pack slots that they can use during most levels. The number of slots can be increased through purchases with in-game money. At the start of a level, the player is shown the various types of zombies to expect and given the opportunity to select which seed packs to take into the level. Several plants are nocturnal, such as mushrooms, have a lower sunlight cost, and are ideal for nighttime levels. Certain plants are highly effective against specific types of zombies, such as the Magnet-shroom, which can remove metallic items from a zombie, such as helmets, buckets, ladders, and pogo sticks. Plants may be placed on any available square of lawn, on lily pads floating in a pool, or in flowerpots on a rooftop; these last two items may be chosen as a seed pack for their respective level types and deployed to increase the usable planting space.\n\nThe zombies also come in a number of types that have different attributes, in particular, speed, damage tolerance, and abilities. Zombies include those wearing makeshift armor, those who can jump or fly over plants, and a dancing zombie able to summon other zombies from the ground. At various points, the player will be inundated with a huge wave of zombies.\n\nIf a zombie reaches the end of a lane, a lawnmower will shoot forward and destroy all the zombies in that lane. However, if a zombie reaches the end of that same lane for a second time, it will reach the player's house. When this happens, the music changes and the other plants and zombies stop moving while that zombie enters the house. Crunching sounds will be heard, accompanied by a scream and a message saying \"The zombies ate your brains!\". The game will then end and display the [[Game over|Game Over]] dialog box along with an option to retry the level or return to the main menu at the upper-right side of the screen.\n\n===Game modes===\nThe primary game mode is Adventure Mode in which the player can earn money to spend at an in-game store to buy new seed packets and other bonuses. There are also mini-games and puzzles. In the [[Xbox Live Arcade]], [[PlayStation Network]], and [[Nintendo DS]] versions, there is also a co-op mode, as well as 2 player mini-games and a Versus mode (only Versus mode in the Nintendo DS version & Xbox Live Arcade).\n\n==== Adventure mode ====\nThe adventure mode consists of 5 different areas and 50 different area levels (each area contains 10 levels). They are shown with the area number first, followed by the level number (i.e. 1-10) in the game. Each level in this model has a certain amount of flags and one final wave. The adventure mode is the first game mode and is also the main mode. Mini-games are unlocked from here. Every 5th level will be a mini-game, while the 10th level will be a conveyor level.\n\nWhen and if the player plays through it a second time, Crazy Dave will pick 3 random seeds that the player must use based on the zombies and area they are in every level, this is, of course, optional but it can assist the player in getting more of the in-game currency.\n\n==== Mini games ====\n\nMini-games are unlocked during the adventure mode and are mostly for fun. Some of the minigames are inspired by earlier [[PopCap Games|PopCap]] games.\n\n==== Puzzles ====\n\nPuzzles consist of 18 levels from 2 different \"modes\", Vasebreaker, where you break vases that either contains a plant seed or a zombie, and I, Zombie, where you create zombies to destroy cardboard cutouts of plants. On iOS and Android versions, there's also a third mode called Last Stand that similar to the level with the same name from the Mini-Game Mode but with different zombies in each wave.\n\n==== Survival ====\n\nSurvival is the second-largest game mode in ''Plants vs Zombies''. It involves two difficulties as hard and normal and also has different areas. Each normal round has 5 flags and each hard round has 10 flags. It also has an endless streak level as the final level. Survival is the last game mode in the game itself.\n\nThere is also a page of canceled mini-games called the Limbo Page which can be accessed using the Cheat Engine.\n\n==== Zen Garden ====\nThe game also features a [[Japanese rock garden|Zen Garden]], where players can care for plants they previously purchased from Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies or occasionally dropped by zombies. Players can also buy other Zen Garden areas for different plants. Fertilizer, water, and bug spray are necessary for a plant to grow. Plants will grow only when the game has been running for enough time.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Concept===\n''Plants vs. Zombies'' director George Fan intended on balancing the game between a \"gritty\" game and a \"sickeningly cute\" game. Strong strategic elements were included to appeal to more experienced gamers, while keeping it simple to appeal to casual gamers, without needing too many tutorials. He was inspired to make it a [[tower defense]] game after both thinking of a more defense-oriented version of a previous title of his, ''[[Insaniquarium]]'', and playing some ''[[Warcraft III]]'' tower defense [[mod (video gaming)|mods]].<ref name=\"ars dev\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/03/george-fan-how-insaniquarium-2-became-plants-vs-zombies.ars |title=Aliens in the garden: the secret origin of Plants vs. Zombies |first=Michael |last=Thompson |date=March 19, 2010 |accessdate=March 20, 2010 |publisher=Ars Technica |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322191116/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/03/george-fan-how-insaniquarium-2-became-plants-vs-zombies.ars |archivedate=March 22, 2010 }}</ref> While he was looking at the towers in ''Warcraft III'', he felt that plants would make good towers.

Showing her how to customize their card decks inspired him to design Plants vs Zombies with seed packets rather than his original idea of using a conveyor belt that produced randomly selected plants, due to the greater complexity of the seed packet method. While the conveyor belt idea was dropped from the more common game mode, it remained as a special element in select levels.<ref name=\"gamasutra fan 10th\"/> Another influence on ''Plants vs. Zombies'' besides ''Warcraft III'' and ''Insaniquarium'' was ''[[Tapper (arcade game)|Tapper]]'', crediting the use of five lanes to this game.<ref name=\"gamezebo\"/><ref name=\"edge\">{{cite web|title=Flower Defence |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/flower-defence |publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=May 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821190932/http://www.next-gen.biz/features/flower-defence |archivedate=August 21, 2010 }}</ref> Various members of [[PopCap Games]] contributed to the development of ''Plants vs. Zombies'' through an internal forum where they gave feedback.\n\nSome of the characteristics that defined ''Insaniquarium'' influenced the development of ''Plants vs. Zombies''. Players advance in a similar pace by receiving new plants. Also, the way plants are chosen at the beginning of each level was derived from the way pets are chosen in ''Insaniquarium''.<ref name=\"gamezebo\" /> Other inspiration for the game's mechanics came from the film ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'', especially where the family defends against pirates. This was the inspiration for the Potato Mine; Fan stated that it was satisfying to watch a zombie step on the mine, being defeated and covered in mashed potatoes.<ref name=hobbit>{{cite web|title=Game Industry Insider: George Fan |url=http://hobbithollow.blogspot.com/2009/05/game-industry-insider-george-fan.html |website=hobbithollow.blogspot.com |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207090732/http://hobbithollow.blogspot.com/2009/05/game-industry-insider-george-fan.html |archivedate=February 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Design===\nThe team wanted to bring back the aliens from ''Insaniquarium'', but in the end they were changed to zombies, which players could react to more easily because of how slowly they moved. George's favorite zombie was the Pole Vaulting Zombie, due to the hilarity involved when a player encounters it for the first time, using a specific example where a player tries to block it with the Wall-Nut, only to have the zombie jump over it.<ref name=\"gamezebo\"/><ref name=\"edge\"/><ref name=gamearena/>\n\nDuring development, it was discovered that newcomers to the genre of real-time strategy may have a hard time learning the concept behind sun collection. So, the price of the income generating sunflowers was dropped from 100 to 50 to encourage players to buy them over the attacking peashooter. As a result, the balance between plants and zombies had to be restructured\u2014a move that Fan said was definitely worth the effort.<ref name=gamezebo/> Programmers focused on Adventure mode for much of the first year of development. Upon finishing some items ahead of schedule, one of the programmers, Tod Semple, began working on ideas that would later be used for the [[minigame]] section. Some ideas for the puzzle mode section would later be tweaked and moved into adventure mode; \"Vasebreaker\" and \"I, Zombie\", for example, came from single-level minigame concepts. During testing, Fan found that minigame and puzzle modes seemed to detract from the focus on Adventure mode, so some of the additional modes and minigames were locked requiring advancement within adventure mode to become unlocked.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\nFan stated that every game he worked on had only him designing the prototype, adding that he used to draw a lot before he made games, where he made pixel art. The final designs of the zombies and the first plants are similar to how they were initially. After searching for an artist, they discovered Rich Werner, who Fan thought clicked with what he intended for the design. He attributed the intrigue of the design to its animation scheme; Tod Semple suggested that they animate it in [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] and export it into the game. Fan worried that this would look like it was cut out from paper, and would resemble ''[[South Park]]'' too much, but was satisfied in the end, attributing this to Semple and Werner's talents.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\nFan was most proud of the Tall-nut, Torchwood, and Cob Cannon plants. He explained that the Tall-nut has character, citing its \"determined gaze\" and how it sheds a single tear when hurt. Laura Shigihara could not stand to see this and protected it with a protective plant called a Pumpkin, which can protect plants inside it. He felt that the Torchwood \u2013 which gives Peashooters flaming ammunition \u2013 required players to think of how plants interacted with each other.<ref name=\"gamezebo\" /><ref name=\"edge\"/> Another favorite plant of Fan's was the Squash, due to how its name suggested its purpose; to squash things.<ref name=\"gamearena\">{{cite web|title=GameArena Interviews George Fan, Plants vs Zombies Man |url=http://www.gamearena.com.au/news/read.php/4948392?latest=1 |website=www.gamearena.com.au |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=June 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001123643/http://www.gamearena.com.au/news/read.php/4948392?latest=1 |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}</ref> A plant was proposed that is similar to the defensive item Umbrella Leaf, which would be planted above other plants to protect them from bungee zombies and catapult zombies. However, it was difficult to visualize their positions.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\n===Cultural references===\n''Plants vs. Zombies'' uses many cultural references in its names of stages and others. The gravestones' inscriptions (\"Expired\", \"Ceased to Exist\", \"Just Resting\", etc.) were taken from [[Monty Python]]'s \"[[Dead Parrot sketch]]\". Three of the mini-games\u2014\"Zombiquarium\", \"Beghouled\" and \"Beghouled Twist\"\u2014take their names from two other PopCap games: ''[[Insaniquarium]]'', ''[[Bejeweled]]'' and ''[[Bejeweled Twist]]'' respectively.<ref name=\"edge\"/><ref name=\"1up\"/> Two levels in \"vasebreaker\" puzzles, \"Scary Potter\" and \"Ace of Vase\", take their names from ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and [[Ace of Base]]. Similarly, the \"I, Zombie\" (a reference to Isaac Asimov's \"[[I, Robot]]\") puzzles have levels called \"Dead Zeppelin\" (resembling [[Led Zeppelin]]) and \"All your brainz r belong to us\" (a play on the gaming meme \"[[All your base are belong to us]]\"). The name of the Torchwood plant is a reference to ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and its spin-off show ''[[Torchwood]].'' Originally, the dancing zombie resembled [[Michael Jackson]] from the short film \"[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: Masterful Plants vs. Zombies Proves Less Is More |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/05/plants-vs-zombies/ |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=May 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905150515/http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/05/plants-vs-zombies |archivedate=September 5, 2009 }}</ref> Though the Jackson-inspired zombie was present in the game before Jackson's death, the estate of Michael Jackson objected to its inclusion more than a year after his death; PopCap agreed to remove the Jackson-inspired zombie and replaced it with a more generic [[disco]]-dancing one for all future patches and releases of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2010/07/27/michael-jackson-estate-forces-plants-vs-zombies-update/ |title=Michael Jackson Estate Forces 'Plants vs. Zombies' Update |first=Russ |last=Frustick |date=July 27, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2010 |work=[[MTV]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728105628/http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2010/07/27/michael-jackson-estate-forces-plants-vs-zombies-update/ |archivedate=July 28, 2010 }}</ref>  A \"disclaimer\" in the game's almanac states \"Any resemblance between Dancing Zombie and any persons living or dead is purely coincidental.\" Some ''Plants vs. Zombies'' advertisements parody controversial ''[[Evony]]'' ads, showing a drooling zombie instead of a voluptuous woman.<ref name=\"escapist\">[http://www.offworld.com/2009/07/evony-agony-popcaps-plants-vs.html \"Plants vs. Zombies Pokes Fun At Cleavage-Filled Evony Ads\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801095310/http://www.offworld.com/2009/07/evony-agony-popcaps-plants-vs.html |date=August 1, 2009 }}, [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]], July 30, 2009</ref>\n\nA planned name was ''Lawn of the Dead'', a pun on the title of the [[George A.

He is later abducted by a Bungee Zombie on level 5\u201310 right before he can tell the player Dr. Zomboss' weaknesses, and reappears during Sunflower's rendition of \"Zombies on your Lawn\" after Dr. Zomboss's defeat at the end of the game. He has a shop known as \"Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies\" that he runs from the back of his car once he finds his car keys after Level 3\u20134. He sells several plant upgrades, extra defenses, and Zen Garden items. Crazy Dave's notable features include a rugged beard and a pot always worn on his head, as well as his signature babbling speech.\n\n===Dr. Zomboss===\n'''Dr. Edgar George Zomboss''' is the main antagonist and the leader of the zombies in ''Plants vs. Zombies'', and reappears in the sequel, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time]]''. He is battled on the Night Roof during Level 5\u201310 as the final boss in ''Plants vs. Zombies''. The name \"Zomboss\" is a portmanteau of the words \"Zombie\" and \"Boss\", meaning \"Zombie Boss\", while the Zombot, the machine used by Dr. Zomboss in the game, is a portmanteau of the words \"Zombie\" and \"Robot\", meaning \"Zombie Robot\". His middle name, George, is after the name of the game's creator, [[George Fan]].\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Edgar Zomboss.png|thumb|235px|left|Dr. Zomboss' ''Suburban Almanac'' Entry]] -->\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack for ''Plants vs. Zombies'' was composed by [[Laura Shigihara]]. It borrows elements from the pop music genre, as well as console [[chiptune]]s. Before the inception of ''Plants vs. Zombies'', Director George Fan asked Laura if she would like to compose the music for his next title after following her for some years. She accepted, owing to his creativity. Shigihara described the music as \"macabre, yet goofy\". Using the night stage as an example, she used a combination of \"Big Band\" and swing beats with \"several haunting and serious melodies\". The songs  \"Loonboon\" and \"Brainiac Maniac\" were written towards the end of production. The song \"Ultimate Battle\" also appears in the game Melolune. She stated that these were reactionary songs that she wrote to fit the feel of the game after having played through it twice.

/>\n}}\n\n'''''Plants vs. Zombies''''' is a [[tower defense]] and [[strategy]] [[video game]] developed and originally published by [[PopCap Games]] for [[Windows]] and [[OS X]] in May 2009, and ported to consoles, handhelds, and mobile devices, and in remastered versions for personal computers.\n\nIn ''Plants vs. Zombies'', the player takes the role of a homeowner in the midst of a [[zombie apocalypse]]. To defend their home from zombies, some of which have unique abilities, the player uses plants that can fire projectiles at, or have other detrimental effects on, the hoard of advancing zombies. The player collects \"sun\" with which defending plants can be bought. Zombies approach along several parallel lanes on the lawn, and the player must plan defenses in these lanes. If a zombie makes it to the house on any lane, the game is over. \n\nDirector George Fan was inspired to make the game after playing other tower defense titles and desiring to eliminate the typical strategies of sending advancing enemies through mazes of defenses, instead adapting the lane approach to remove this strategy.\n\nThe game received a positive response from critics and was nominated for multiple [[Interactive Achievement Award]]s, alongside receiving praise for its musical score. It was followed by one direct sequel and another being made for mobile devices, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time]],'' released in 2013 for iOS and Android, and Plants vs. Zombies 3 respectively; two third-person shooters, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare]]'' and [[Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2|its sequel]], and a digital collectible card game, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies Heroes]]''. On October 18, 2019, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville]]'' was also released. On February 25, 2020, Plants vs. Zombies 3 was soft-launched.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Plants vs Zombies Gameplay.png|thumb|200px|left|Game in progress]]\n\nIn ''Plants vs. Zombies'', players place different types of plants and fungi, each with their own unique offensive or defensive capabilities, around their house, in order to stop a horde of [[zombie (fictional)|zombies]] from reaching it. The playing field is divided into 5 to 6 horizontal lanes, each with lawnmowers, and with rare exceptions, a zombie will move towards the player's house along one lane only (the main exception is if it has bitten garlic, causing it to move to another lane). Planting costs \"sun\", which can be gathered for free (albeit slowly) during daytime levels and by planting certain plants or fungi. Most plants can attack or defend against zombies in the lane they are planted in only. In later levels, players can purchase upgrades with different offensive and defensive abilities.\n\nThe game uses several different level types and layouts, each with their own gimmick. The game starts out in a front yard (the standard) and progresses to nighttime levels (sun won't be able to be gathered for free), where the gameplay is more challenging without any replenishing sun unless specific plants are used. Other levels feature the backyard, with a pool added (in general more to cost). Later levels are nighttime pool levels (where fog fills the right half of the screen except when specific plants are used), a lightning storm level in pitch black (except when illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning), and rooftop levels (where a slanted roof renders most offensive plants useless). On the final level, the player must face a huge robot operated by a zombie who takes the form of a mad scientist known as [[#Dr. Zomboss|Dr. Zomboss]]. At set points throughout the game, the player is either warned through a letter by zombies or addressed by their neighbor, [[#Crazy Dave|Crazy Dave]], to prepare for an ambush, where the game takes on a bowling style, using Wall-nuts to bowl down zombies, or a modified version of regular levels, where random plant types come upon a conveyor belt, and the player can use the plants without spending sun.\n\nThe player starts with a limited number of seed pack types and seed pack slots that they can use during most levels. The number of slots can be increased through purchases with in-game money. At the start of a level, the player is shown the various types of zombies to expect and given the opportunity to select which seed packs to take into the level. Several plants are nocturnal, such as mushrooms, have a lower sunlight cost, and are ideal for nighttime levels. Certain plants are highly effective against specific types of zombies, such as the Magnet-shroom, which can remove metallic items from a zombie, such as helmets, buckets, ladders, and pogo sticks. Plants may be placed on any available square of lawn, on lily pads floating in a pool, or in flowerpots on a rooftop; these last two items may be chosen as a seed pack for their respective level types and deployed to increase the usable planting space.\n\nThe zombies also come in a number of types that have different attributes, in particular, speed, damage tolerance, and abilities. Zombies include those wearing makeshift armor, those who can jump or fly over plants, and a dancing zombie able to summon other zombies from the ground. At various points, the player will be inundated with a huge wave of zombies.\n\nIf a zombie reaches the end of a lane, a lawnmower will shoot forward and destroy all the zombies in that lane. However, if a zombie reaches the end of that same lane for a second time, it will reach the player's house. When this happens, the music changes and the other plants and zombies stop moving while that zombie enters the house. Crunching sounds will be heard, accompanied by a scream and a message saying \"The zombies ate your brains!\". The game will then end and display the [[Game over|Game Over]] dialog box along with an option to retry the level or return to the main menu at the upper-right side of the screen.\n\n===Game modes===\nThe primary game mode is Adventure Mode in which the player can earn money to spend at an in-game store to buy new seed packets and other bonuses. There are also mini-games and puzzles. In the [[Xbox Live Arcade]], [[PlayStation Network]], and [[Nintendo DS]] versions, there is also a co-op mode, as well as 2 player mini-games and a Versus mode (only Versus mode in the Nintendo DS version & Xbox Live Arcade).\n\n==== Adventure mode ====\nThe adventure mode consists of 5 different areas and 50 different area levels (each area contains 10 levels). They are shown with the area number first, followed by the level number (i.e. 1-10) in the game. Each level in this model has a certain amount of flags and one final wave. The adventure mode is the first game mode and is also the main mode. Mini-games are unlocked from here. Every 5th level will be a mini-game, while the 10th level will be a conveyor level.\n\nWhen and if the player plays through it a second time, Crazy Dave will pick 3 random seeds that the player must use based on the zombies and area they are in every level, this is, of course, optional but it can assist the player in getting more of the in-game currency.\n\n==== Mini games ====\n\nMini-games are unlocked during the adventure mode and are mostly for fun. Some of the minigames are inspired by earlier [[PopCap Games|PopCap]] games.\n\n==== Puzzles ====\n\nPuzzles consist of 18 levels from 2 different \"modes\", Vasebreaker, where you break vases that either contains a plant seed or a zombie, and I, Zombie, where you create zombies to destroy cardboard cutouts of plants. On iOS and Android versions, there's also a third mode called Last Stand that similar to the level with the same name from the Mini-Game Mode but with different zombies in each wave.\n\n==== Survival ====\n\nSurvival is the second-largest game mode in ''Plants vs Zombies''. It involves two difficulties as hard and normal and also has different areas. Each normal round has 5 flags and each hard round has 10 flags. It also has an endless streak level as the final level. Survival is the last game mode in the game itself.\n\nThere is also a page of canceled mini-games called the Limbo Page which can be accessed using the Cheat Engine.\n\n==== Zen Garden ====\nThe game also features a [[Japanese rock garden|Zen Garden]], where players can care for plants they previously purchased from Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies or occasionally dropped by zombies. Players can also buy other Zen Garden areas for different plants. Fertilizer, water, and bug spray are necessary for a plant to grow. Plants will grow only when the game has been running for enough time.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Concept===\n''Plants vs. Zombies'' director George Fan intended on balancing the game between a \"gritty\" game and a \"sickeningly cute\" game. Strong strategic elements were included to appeal to more experienced gamers, while keeping it simple to appeal to casual gamers, without needing too many tutorials. He was inspired to make it a [[tower defense]] game after both thinking of a more defense-oriented version of a previous title of his, ''[[Insaniquarium]]'', and playing some ''[[Warcraft III]]'' tower defense [[mod (video gaming)|mods]].<ref name=\"ars dev\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/03/george-fan-how-insaniquarium-2-became-plants-vs-zombies.ars |title=Aliens in the garden: the secret origin of Plants vs. Zombies |first=Michael |last=Thompson |date=March 19, 2010 |accessdate=March 20, 2010 |publisher=Ars Technica |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322191116/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/03/george-fan-how-insaniquarium-2-became-plants-vs-zombies.ars |archivedate=March 22, 2010 }}</ref> While he was looking at the towers in ''Warcraft III'', he felt that plants would make good towers.

Showing her how to customize their card decks inspired him to design Plants vs Zombies with seed packets rather than his original idea of using a conveyor belt that produced randomly selected plants, due to the greater complexity of the seed packet method. While the conveyor belt idea was dropped from the more common game mode, it remained as a special element in select levels.<ref name=\"gamasutra fan 10th\"/> Another influence on ''Plants vs. Zombies'' besides ''Warcraft III'' and ''Insaniquarium'' was ''[[Tapper (arcade game)|Tapper]]'', crediting the use of five lanes to this game.<ref name=\"gamezebo\"/><ref name=\"edge\">{{cite web|title=Flower Defence |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/flower-defence |publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=May 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821190932/http://www.next-gen.biz/features/flower-defence |archivedate=August 21, 2010 }}</ref> Various members of [[PopCap Games]] contributed to the development of ''Plants vs. Zombies'' through an internal forum where they gave feedback.\n\nSome of the characteristics that defined ''Insaniquarium'' influenced the development of ''Plants vs. Zombies''. Players advance in a similar pace by receiving new plants. Also, the way plants are chosen at the beginning of each level was derived from the way pets are chosen in ''Insaniquarium''.<ref name=\"gamezebo\" /> Other inspiration for the game's mechanics came from the film ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'', especially where the family defends against pirates. This was the inspiration for the Potato Mine; Fan stated that it was satisfying to watch a zombie step on the mine, being defeated and covered in mashed potatoes.<ref name=hobbit>{{cite web|title=Game Industry Insider: George Fan |url=http://hobbithollow.blogspot.com/2009/05/game-industry-insider-george-fan.html |website=hobbithollow.blogspot.com |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207090732/http://hobbithollow.blogspot.com/2009/05/game-industry-insider-george-fan.html |archivedate=February 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Design===\nThe team wanted to bring back the aliens from ''Insaniquarium'', but in the end they were changed to zombies, which players could react to more easily because of how slowly they moved. George's favorite zombie was the Pole Vaulting Zombie, due to the hilarity involved when a player encounters it for the first time, using a specific example where a player tries to block it with the Wall-Nut, only to have the zombie jump over it.<ref name=\"gamezebo\"/><ref name=\"edge\"/><ref name=gamearena/>\n\nDuring development, it was discovered that newcomers to the genre of real-time strategy may have a hard time learning the concept behind sun collection. So, the price of the income generating sunflowers was dropped from 100 to 50 to encourage players to buy them over the attacking peashooter. As a result, the balance between plants and zombies had to be restructured\u2014a move that Fan said was definitely worth the effort.<ref name=gamezebo/> Programmers focused on Adventure mode for much of the first year of development. Upon finishing some items ahead of schedule, one of the programmers, Tod Semple, began working on ideas that would later be used for the [[minigame]] section. Some ideas for the puzzle mode section would later be tweaked and moved into adventure mode; \"Vasebreaker\" and \"I, Zombie\", for example, came from single-level minigame concepts. During testing, Fan found that minigame and puzzle modes seemed to detract from the focus on Adventure mode, so some of the additional modes and minigames were locked requiring advancement within adventure mode to become unlocked.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\nFan stated that every game he worked on had only him designing the prototype, adding that he used to draw a lot before he made games, where he made pixel art. The final designs of the zombies and the first plants are similar to how they were initially. After searching for an artist, they discovered Rich Werner, who Fan thought clicked with what he intended for the design. He attributed the intrigue of the design to its animation scheme; Tod Semple suggested that they animate it in [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] and export it into the game. Fan worried that this would look like it was cut out from paper, and would resemble ''[[South Park]]'' too much, but was satisfied in the end, attributing this to Semple and Werner's talents.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\nFan was most proud of the Tall-nut, Torchwood, and Cob Cannon plants. He explained that the Tall-nut has character, citing its \"determined gaze\" and how it sheds a single tear when hurt. Laura Shigihara could not stand to see this and protected it with a protective plant called a Pumpkin, which can protect plants inside it. He felt that the Torchwood \u2013 which gives Peashooters flaming ammunition \u2013 required players to think of how plants interacted with each other.<ref name=\"gamezebo\" /><ref name=\"edge\"/> Another favorite plant of Fan's was the Squash, due to how its name suggested its purpose; to squash things.<ref name=\"gamearena\">{{cite web|title=GameArena Interviews George Fan, Plants vs Zombies Man |url=http://www.gamearena.com.au/news/read.php/4948392?latest=1 |website=www.gamearena.com.au |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=June 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001123643/http://www.gamearena.com.au/news/read.php/4948392?latest=1 |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}</ref> A plant was proposed that is similar to the defensive item Umbrella Leaf, which would be planted above other plants to protect them from bungee zombies and catapult zombies. However, it was difficult to visualize their positions.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\n===Cultural references===\n''Plants vs. Zombies'' uses many cultural references in its names of stages and others. The gravestones' inscriptions (\"Expired\", \"Ceased to Exist\", \"Just Resting\", etc.) were taken from [[Monty Python]]'s \"[[Dead Parrot sketch]]\". Three of the mini-games\u2014\"Zombiquarium\", \"Beghouled\" and \"Beghouled Twist\"\u2014take their names from two other PopCap games: ''[[Insaniquarium]]'', ''[[Bejeweled]]'' and ''[[Bejeweled Twist]]'' respectively.<ref name=\"edge\"/><ref name=\"1up\"/> Two levels in \"vasebreaker\" puzzles, \"Scary Potter\" and \"Ace of Vase\", take their names from ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and [[Ace of Base]]. Similarly, the \"I, Zombie\" (a reference to Isaac Asimov's \"[[I, Robot]]\") puzzles have levels called \"Dead Zeppelin\" (resembling [[Led Zeppelin]]) and \"All your brainz r belong to us\" (a play on the gaming meme \"[[All your base are belong to us]]\"). The name of the Torchwood plant is a reference to ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and its spin-off show ''[[Torchwood]].''

He is later abducted by a Bungee Zombie on level 5\u201310 right before he can tell the player Dr. Zomboss' weaknesses, and reappears during Sunflower's rendition of \"Zombies on your Lawn\" after Dr. Zomboss's defeat at the end of the game. He has a shop known as \"Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies\" that he runs from the back of his car once he finds his car keys after Level 3\u20134. He sells several plant upgrades, extra defenses, and Zen Garden items. Crazy Dave's notable features include a rugged beard and a pot always worn on his head, as well as his signature babbling speech.\n\n===Dr. Zomboss===\n'''Dr. Edgar George Zomboss''' is the main antagonist and the leader of the zombies in ''Plants vs. Zombies'', and reappears in the sequel, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time]]''. He is battled on the Night Roof during Level 5\u201310 as the final boss in ''Plants vs. Zombies''. The name \"Zomboss\" is a portmanteau of the words \"Zombie\" and \"Boss\", meaning \"Zombie Boss\", while the Zombot, the machine used by Dr. Zomboss in the game, is a portmanteau of the words \"Zombie\" and \"Robot\", meaning \"Zombie Robot\". His middle name, George, is after the name of the game's creator, [[George Fan]].\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Edgar Zomboss.png|thumb|235px|left|Dr. Zomboss' ''Suburban Almanac'' Entry]] -->\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack for ''Plants vs. Zombies'' was composed by [[Laura Shigihara]]. It borrows elements from the pop music genre, as well as console [[chiptune]]s. Before the inception of ''Plants vs. Zombies'', Director George Fan asked Laura if she would like to compose the music for his next title after following her for some years. She accepted, owing to his creativity. Shigihara described the music as \"macabre, yet goofy\". Using the night stage as an example, she used a combination of \"Big Band\" and swing beats with \"several haunting and serious melodies\". The songs  \"Loonboon\" and \"Brainiac Maniac\" were written towards the end of production. The song \"Ultimate Battle\" also appears in the game Melolune. She stated that these were reactionary songs that she wrote to fit the feel of the game after having played through it twice. She tried to make the game have a [[Danny Elfman]] feel to it, while mixing in melodic tunes and funky beats. She describes a song early in the game, which uses marching band percussion and swing beats. She described another one which used techno beats with organic sounds.<ref name=\"gamasutra\">{{cite web|title=Interview: The Terrifying True Story of The Plants vs. Zombies Soundtrack |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/news/originals/?story=23666 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=May 19, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110102040/http://www.gamasutra.com/news/originals/?story=23666 |archivedate=November 10, 2009 }}</ref>\nShigihara also composed and performed the music video shown during the credits of the game, titled \"Zombies on Your Lawn\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Laura Shigihara \u2013 Lyrics |url=http://shigi.wordpress.com/lyrics/#Zombies%20on%20your%20Lawn |publisher=Laura Shigihara |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901114852/http://shigi.wordpress.com/lyrics/ |archivedate=September 1, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Plants vs Zombies Music Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N1_0SUGlDQ |publisher=PlantsVsZombies channel ([[PopCap Games]]) |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707075923/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N1_0SUGlDQ |archivedate=July 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = PC: 88%<ref name=\"GRPC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/pc/959255-plants-vs-zombies/index.html |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PC |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309124318/http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/959255-plants-vs-zombies/index.html |archivedate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>\n| MC = PC: 87/100<ref name=\"MCPC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226133832/http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies |archivedate=December 26, 2017}}</ref><br />iOS: 92/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for iPhone/iPad Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />(iPad) iOS: 93/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/plants-vs-zombies-hd |title=Plants vs. Zombies HD for iPhone/iPad Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />X360: 89/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for Xbox 360 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />DS: 81/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for DS Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />PS3: 85/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PlayStation 3 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />(DSiWare) DS: 73/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/plants-vs-zombies-dsiware |title=Plants vs. Zombies (DSiWare) for DS Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />PSVita: 77/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PlayStation Vita Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n| 1UP = A\u2212<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3174094&p=1 |title=Plants vs Zombies Review for the PC from |publisher=1UP.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref>\n| Destruct =  10/10\n| Edge = 9/10\n| EuroG = 9/10\n| GamePro = {{Rating|4.5|5}}\n| GSpot = 8.5/10\n| IGN = 9.0/10<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web|last=Hatfield |first=Daemon |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/979/979621p1.html |title=Plants vs. Zombies Review \u2013 PC Review at IGN |publisher=Pc.ign.com |date=May 5, 2009 |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611154544/http://pc.ign.com/articles/979/979621p1.html |archivedate=June 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n| PCGUK = 90%\n| rev1 = ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''\n| rev1Score = 9/10\n| rev2 = ''[[Gamezebo]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}\n| rev3 = ''[[TouchArcade]]''\n| rev3Score = iOS: {{rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://toucharcade.com/2010/02/14/plants-vs-zombies-the-zombies-are-coming/ |title='Plants vs. Zombies' \u2013 The Zombies...

[http://www.gob.mx/sagarpa SAGARPA website] The goal of the office was to ensure food security in Mexico and abroad through selective plant breeding and crop improvement.\n\nThe project developed into a collaboration between Mexican and international researchers. It established global networks to test experimental crop varieties. One of its researchers, wheat breeder [[Norman Borlaug]], developed dwarf wheat varieties that put more energy into grain production and responded better to fertilizer than older varieties, won the Nobel Peace Prize for that work in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/borlaug-facts.html |title=Norman Borlaug - Facts |website=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}</ref> The program was renamed and morphed into CIMMYT in 1963, though it was still under the Secretariat of Agriculture's jurisdiction. As international demand grew and it became apparent CIMMYT required internal organization and increased funding, the center was reorganized and established as a non-profit scientific and educational institution in its own right in 1966.\n\nIn the early 1970s, a small cadre of development organizations, national sponsors, and private foundations organized CGIAR to further spread the impact of agricultural research to more nations. CIMMYT became one of the first international research centers to be supported through the CGIAR. Today, the CGIAR comprises 15 such centers, all dedicated to [[sustainable food systems|sustainable food]] security through scientific research.<ref name=\"cimmyt\" />\n\n== Activities ==\n\nCIMMYT focuses on 1) the conservation and utilization of maize and wheat genetic resources, 2) developing and promoting improved maize and wheat varieties, 3) testing and sharing sustainable farming systems, 4) analyzing the impact of its work and researching ways for further improvement. In Mexico in the late 1980s, CIMMYT began working developing better varieties of maize and wheat that helped small peasant farmers, using breeding to increase crops' resistance to pests and diseases, as well as raise the protein content of maize.<ref>Joseph Cotter, ''Troubled Harvest: Agronomy and Revolution in Mexico, 1880-2002''. Contributions in Latin American Studies, No. 22. Westport CT: Prager 2003, p. 290.</ref>\nCIMMYT partners with national agriculture research institutions across the globe. Though its headquarters are in Mexico, the center supports 13 regional offices (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Nepal, Pakistan, Turkey, and Zimbabwe), as well as number of experimental stations.\n\n== CIMMYT programs and units ==\n=== Global Wheat Program and Global Maize Program ===\nThe core of CIMMYT is its two main programs: the Global Wheat Program<ref>[http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/rainf_wht/index.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717062246/http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/rainf_wht/index.cfm |date=July 17, 2010 }}</ref> and the Global Maize Program.<ref>[http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/afr_livelih/index.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808055150/http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/afr_livelih/index.cfm |date=August 8, 2009 }}</ref> Both programs specialize in breeding varieties of their respective crop that are high yielding and adapted to withstand specific environmental constraints, such as infertile soils, drought, insects, and diseases.

A dependency on expensive 'high-yielding' seeds that demand expensive fertilizers has pushed local farmers who cannot afford them out of the market, causing further social inequalities. The seeds, which require a lot of water, has also increased soil erosion and water wastage.<ref name=\"Vidal\"/> At the time Norman Borlaug began the Green Revolution, the US agricultural science establishment and agribusiness industries supported him, because it allowed their industries to grow around the world as dependency on their patented seeds and herbicides increased.<ref name=\"Vidal\"/> Today, CIMMYT still relies on these private companies for seeds and herbicides, such as StrigAway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.feedthefuture.gov/article/a-new-twist-on-seed-technology/|title=A New Twist on Seed Technology|date=2015-01-28|website=Feed the Future|language=en|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>\n\n== Partners and donors ==\nMain donors include [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gatesfoundation.org/search |title=Search - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation |date=18 October 2005 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018111306/http://gatesfoundation.org/search |archivedate=18 October 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database/Grants/2016/03/OPP1134248|title=OPP1134248}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2012/02/Helping-Poor-Farmers-Changes-Needed-to-Feed-1-Billion-Hungry|title=Helping Poor Farmers, Changes Needed to Feed 1 Billion Hungry - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dtma.cimmyt.org/index.php/component/content/article/113-news-release/154-climate-ready-maize-gets-a-boost-phase-iii-of-the-drought-tolerant-maize-in-africa-project-to-reach-more-farmers|title=Climate-ready maize gets a boost: Phase III of the drought tolerant maize in Africa project to reach more farmers|last=Administrator}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalrust.org/blog/cornell-receives-uk-support-aid-scientists-fighting-threats-global-wheat-supply|title=Cornell receives UK support to aid scientists fighting threats to global wheat supply|last=jb755|date=25 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/03/24m-grant-aims-combat-global-wheat-crop-threats|title=$24M grant aims to combat global wheat crop threats - Cornell Chronicle}}</ref> [[CGIAR]], the [[World Bank]] (through cross-cutting, theme and project-based CGIAR funding),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsln.com/news/world-bank-continues-cgiar-funding-only-after-u-s-push-to-maintain-it/|title=World Bank continues CGIAR funding only after U.S. push to maintain it - TSLN.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/sustainabledevelopment/brief/cgiar-global-research-partnership-food-secure-future|title=CGIAR: A Global Research Partnership for a Food Secure Future}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgiar.org/about-us/our-programs/|title=Our Programs}}</ref> [[Syngenta]] Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture,<ref name=\"syngentafoundation.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.syngentafoundation.org/international-wheat-yield-partnership|title=International Wheat Yield Partnership|date=17 November 2016}}</ref> and the national governments of [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Canada]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2014/06/international-agreement-focus-improved-durum-wheat-disease-resistance.html?=undefined&wbdisable=true&_ga=1.82435283.455391987.1488664329|title=International agreement to focus on improved durum wheat disease resistance - Canada.ca|first=Employment and Social Development|last=Canada|date=2014-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/science-and-innovation/international-engagement/scientific-cooperation-with-international-organizations/?id=1180131840314|title=Scientific Cooperation with International Organizations|first=Research Branch;Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada;Government of|last=Canada}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://open.canada.ca/search/grants/reference/c24dbf0f500fcf4940af1db3baf868a5|title=Government Grants and Contributions|first=Open|last=Government}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/about-us/publications/discover-agriculture/the-making-of-wheat-warriors-canadian-wheat-stands-out/?id=1412083175501|title=The Making of Wheat Warriors: Canadian Wheat Stands Out|first=Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada;Government of|last=Canada}}</ref> [[Germany]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giz.de/projektdaten/projects.action?request_locale=en_EN&pn=201401561|title=Project data|first=Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)|last=GmbH}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giz.de/projektdaten/projects.action?request_locale=en_EN&pn=201409713|title=Project data|first=Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)|last=GmbH}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giz.de/expertise/html/5842.html|title=Expertise.

[http://www.gob.mx/sagarpa SAGARPA website] The goal of the office was to ensure food security in Mexico and abroad through selective plant breeding and crop improvement.\n\nThe project developed into a collaboration between Mexican and international researchers. It established global networks to test experimental crop varieties. One of its researchers, wheat breeder [[Norman Borlaug]], developed dwarf wheat varieties that put more energy into grain production and responded better to fertilizer than older varieties, won the Nobel Peace Prize for that work in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/borlaug-facts.html |title=Norman Borlaug - Facts |website=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}</ref> The program was renamed and morphed into CIMMYT in 1963, though it was still under the Secretariat of Agriculture's jurisdiction. As international demand grew and it became apparent CIMMYT required internal organization and increased funding, the center was reorganized and established as a non-profit scientific and educational institution in its own right in 1966.\n\nIn the early 1970s, a small cadre of development organizations, national sponsors, and private foundations organized CGIAR to further spread the impact of agricultural research to more nations. CIMMYT became one of the first international research centers to be supported through the CGIAR. Today, the CGIAR comprises 15 such centers, all dedicated to [[sustainable food systems|sustainable food]] security through scientific research.<ref name=\"cimmyt\" />\n\n== Activities ==\n\nCIMMYT focuses on 1) the conservation and utilization of maize and wheat genetic resources, 2) developing and promoting improved maize and wheat varieties, 3) testing and sharing sustainable farming systems, 4) analyzing the impact of its work and researching ways for further improvement. In Mexico in the late 1980s, CIMMYT began working developing better varieties of maize and wheat that helped small peasant farmers, using breeding to increase crops' resistance to pests and diseases, as well as raise the protein content of maize.<ref>Joseph Cotter, ''Troubled Harvest: Agronomy and Revolution in Mexico, 1880-2002''. Contributions in Latin American Studies, No. 22. Westport CT: Prager 2003, p. 290.</ref>\nCIMMYT partners with national agriculture research institutions across the globe. Though its headquarters are in Mexico, the center supports 13 regional offices (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Nepal, Pakistan, Turkey, and Zimbabwe), as well as number of experimental stations.\n\n== CIMMYT programs and units ==\n=== Global Wheat Program and Global Maize Program ===\nThe core of CIMMYT is its two main programs: the Global Wheat Program<ref>[http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/rainf_wht/index.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717062246/http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/rainf_wht/index.cfm |date=July 17, 2010 }}</ref> and the Global Maize Program.<ref>[http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/afr_livelih/index.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808055150/http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/afr_livelih/index.cfm |date=August 8, 2009 }}</ref> Both programs specialize in breeding varieties of their respective crop that are high yielding and adapted to withstand specific environmental constraints, such as infertile soils, drought, insects, and diseases.

A dependency on expensive 'high-yielding' seeds that demand expensive fertilizers has pushed local farmers who cannot afford them out of the market, causing further social inequalities. The seeds, which require a lot of water, has also increased soil erosion and water wastage.<ref name=\"Vidal\"/> At the time Norman Borlaug began the Green Revolution, the US agricultural science establishment and agribusiness industries supported him, because it allowed their industries to grow around the world as dependency on their patented seeds and herbicides increased.<ref name=\"Vidal\"/> Today, CIMMYT still relies on these private companies for seeds and herbicides, such as StrigAway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.feedthefuture.gov/article/a-new-twist-on-seed-technology/|title=A New Twist on Seed Technology|date=2015-01-28|website=Feed the Future|language=en|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>\n\n== Partners and donors ==\nMain donors include [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gatesfoundation.org/search |title=Search - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation |date=18 October 2005 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018111306/http://gatesfoundation.org/search |archivedate=18 October 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database/Grants/2016/03/OPP1134248|title=OPP1134248}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2012/02/Helping-Poor-Farmers-Changes-Needed-to-Feed-1-Billion-Hungry|title=Helping Poor Farmers, Changes Needed to Feed 1 Billion Hungry - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dtma.cimmyt.org/index.php/component/content/article/113-news-release/154-climate-ready-maize-gets-a-boost-phase-iii-of-the-drought-tolerant-maize-in-africa-project-to-reach-more-farmers|title=Climate-ready maize gets a boost: Phase III of the drought tolerant maize in Africa project to reach more farmers|last=Administrator}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalrust.org/blog/cornell-receives-uk-support-aid-scientists-fighting-threats-global-wheat-supply|title=Cornell receives UK support to aid scientists fighting threats to global wheat supply|last=jb755|date=25 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/03/24m-grant-aims-combat-global-wheat-crop-threats|title=$24M grant aims to combat global wheat crop threats - Cornell Chronicle}}</ref> the [[CGIAR]], [[World Bank]] (through cross-cutting, theme and project-based CGIAR funding),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsln.com/news/world-bank-continues-cgiar-funding-only-after-u-s-push-to-maintain-it/|title=World Bank continues CGIAR funding only after U.S. push to maintain it - TSLN.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/sustainabledevelopment/brief/cgiar-global-research-partnership-food-secure-future|title=CGIAR: A Global Research Partnership for a Food Secure Future}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgiar.org/about-us/our-programs/|title=Our Programs}}</ref> [[Syngenta]] Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture,<ref name=\"syngentafoundation.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.syngentafoundation.org/international-wheat-yield-partnership|title=International Wheat Yield Partnership|date=17 November 2016}}</ref> and the national governments of [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Canada]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2014/06/international-agreement-focus-improved-durum-wheat-disease-resistance.html?=undefined&wbdisable=true&_ga=1.82435283.455391987.1488664329|title=International agreement to focus on improved durum wheat disease resistance - Canada.ca|first=Employment and Social Development|last=Canada|date=2014-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/science-and-innovation/international-engagement/scientific-cooperation-with-international-organizations/?id=1180131840314|title=Scientific Cooperation with International Organizations|first=Research Branch;Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada;Government of|last=Canada}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://open.canada.ca/search/grants/reference/c24dbf0f500fcf4940af1db3baf868a5|title=Government Grants and Contributions|first=Open|last=Government}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/about-us/publications/discover-agriculture/the-making-of-wheat-warriors-canadian-wheat-stands-out/?id=1412083175501|title=The Making of Wheat Warriors: Canadian Wheat Stands Out|first=Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada;Government of|last=Canada}}</ref> [[Germany]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giz.de/projektdaten/projects.action?request_locale=en_EN&pn=201401561|title=Project data|first=Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)|last=GmbH}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giz.de/projektdaten/projects.action?request_locale=en_EN&pn=201409713|title=Project data|first=Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)|last=GmbH}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giz.de/expertise/html/5842.html|title=Expertise.

He effectively controlled the province of [[Shanxi]] from the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] to the 1949 Communist victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. As the leader of a relatively small, poor, remote province, he survived the machinations of [[Yuan Shikai]], the [[Warlord Era]], the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Era]], the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] and the [[Chinese Civil War|subsequent civil war]], being forced from office only when the Nationalist armies with which he was aligned had completely lost control of the Chinese mainland, isolating Shanxi from any source of economic or military supply. He has been viewed by Western biographers as a transitional figure who advocated using Western technology to protect Chinese traditions, while at the same time reforming older political, social and economic conditions in a way that paved the way for the radical changes that would occur after his rule.<ref name=\"Portrait1\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 289</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nHe was born in the late [[Qing Dynasty]] in [[Wutai County]], [[Xinzhou]], Shanxi, to a family that had been bankers and merchants for generations (Shanxi was known for its many successful banks until the late 19th century). As a young man he worked for several years at his father's bank while pursuing a traditional Confucian education at a local village school. After his father was ruined by a late 19th-century depression that ravaged the Chinese economy, Yan enrolled in a free military school that was run and financed by the Manchu government in [[Taiyuan]]. While studying at this school he was first introduced to mathematics, physics and various other subjects imported directly from the West. In 1904 he was sent to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] to study at the [[Tokyo Shimbu Gakko]], a military preparatory academy, after which he entered the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]], from which he graduated in 1909.<ref name=\"Portrait2\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 290</ref>\n\n===Experience in Japan===\nOver the five years that Yan studied in Japan, he became impressed by the country's efforts to successfully modernize. He observed the progress made by the Japanese (whom the Chinese had previously considered unsophisticated and backward) and began to worry about the consequences if China were to fall behind the rest of the world. This formative experience was later cited as a period of great inspiration for his later efforts to modernize Shanxi.<ref name=\"Portrait2\" />\n\nYan eventually concluded that the Japanese had successfully modernized largely due to the government's abilities to mobilize its populace in support of its policies and to the close, respectful relationship that existed between the military and civilian populations. He attributed the surprising Japanese victory in the 1905 [[Russo-Japanese War]] to the enthusiastic mobilization of the Japanese public in support of the military. After returning to China in 1910 he wrote a pamphlet warning China that it was in danger of being overtaken by Japan unless it developed a local form of ''[[bushido]]''.<ref name=\"Portrait3\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 291</ref>\n\nEven before studying in Japan, Yan had become disgusted with the open and widespread corruption of Qing officials in Shanxi, and had become convinced that China's relative helplessness in the 19th century was the result of the dynasty's generally hostile attitude towards modernization and industrial development, and a grossly inept foreign policy. While he was in Japan he met [[Sun Yat-sen]] and joined his [[Tongmenghui]] (Revolutionary Alliance), a semi-secret society dedicated to overthrowing the Qing dynasty. He also attempted to popularize Sun's ideology by organizing an affiliated \"Blood and Iron Society\" within the ranks of Chinese students at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. The goal of this student group was to organize a revolution that would lead to the creation of a strong and united China, similar to how [[Otto von Bismarck]] had created a strong and united Germany.<ref name=\"Portrait3\" /> Yan also joined an even more militant organization of Chinese revolutionaries, the \"Dare-to-Die Corps\".<ref name=\"W399\">Wang 399</ref>\n\n===Return to China===\nWhen he returned to China in 1909 he was assigned as a division commander of the [[New Army]] in Shanxi,<ref name=\"Portrait4\" /> but secretly worked to overthrow the Qing.<ref name=\"W399\" /> During the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] Yan led local revolutionary forces in driving Manchu troops from the province, proclaiming it independent of the Qing government. He justified his actions by attacking the Qing's failure to repel [[Concessions in China|foreign aggression]], and promised a wide range of social and political reforms.<ref name=\"Portrait4\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 292</ref>\n\n==Career in the early Republic==\n[[File:Yan Xishan3.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Yan Xishan in the early 1920s, shortly after taking power in Shanxi.]]\n\n===Conflict with Yuan Shikai===\nIn 1911 Yan hoped to join forces with another prominent Shanxi revolutionary, Wu Luzhen, in order to undermine [[Yuan Shikai]]'s control of north China, but these plans were aborted after Wu was assassinated.<ref name=\"W399\" /> Yan was elected military governor by his comrades but was unable to prevent a subsequent invasion by the troops of Yuan Shikai, who occupied most parts of Shanxi in 1913. During the period of Yuan's invasion, Yan was only able to survive by withdrawing northward and aligning himself with a friendly insurgent group in neighboring [[Shaanxi]] province. By avoiding a decisive military confrontation with Yuan, Yan was able to preserve his own base of power. Though he was friends with Sun Yat-sen, Yan withheld support for him in the 1913 \"[[History of the Republic of China#Second Revolution|Second Revolution]]\", and instead ingratiated himself with Yuan, who allowed him to return as military governor of Shanxi, commanding a military that was then staffed by Yuan's own henchmen.<ref name=\"Portrait4\" /> In 1917, shortly after Yuan Shikai's death, Yan solidified his control over [[Shanxi]], ruling there uncontested.<ref name=\"Spence1\">Spence 406</ref>  After Yuan's death in 1916, China descended into a period of warlordism.\n\nThe determination of Shanxi to resist Manchu rule was a factor leading Yuan to believe that only the abolition of the Qing dynasty could bring peace to China and end the civil war. Yan's inability to resist Yuan's military domination of northern China was a factor contributing to Sun Yat-sen's decision not to personally pursue the presidency of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which was established after the end of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The demonstrated futility of opposing Yuan's military domination can only have made it seem more important to Sun to bring Yuan into the process of ruling the Republic, and to come to terms with his (potential) enemy.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 18</ref>\n\n===Efforts to modernize Shanxi===\nBy 1911, Shanxi was one of the poorest provinces in China. Yan believed that, unless he was able to modernize and revive Shanxi's economy and infrastructure, he would be unable to prevent Shanxi from being overrun by rival warlords.<ref>Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 302</ref>  A military defeat in 1919 inflicted by a rival warlord convinced Yan that Shanxi was not sufficiently developed to compete for hegemony with other warlords, and he avoided the violent national politics of the time by enforcing a neutrality policy on Shanxi, freeing his province from the [[warlord era|civil wars]]. Instead of participating in the ongoing civil wars, Yan devoted himself almost exclusively to modernizing Shanxi and developing its resources. The success of his reforms were sufficient for him to be dubbed by outsiders as the \"Model Governor\", with Shanxi the \"Model Province\".<ref name=\"Portrait4\" />\n\nIn 1918 there was an outbreak of bubonic plague in northern Shanxi that lasted for two months and killed 2,664 people. Yan dealt with this epidemic by issuing instructions on modern germ theory and plague management to his officials. Yan instructed people that the plague was caused by tiny germs that were breathed into the lungs, that the disease was incurable, and that the only way to keep the disease from spreading was physical isolation of the infected. He ordered his officials to keep infected family members, neighbors, or even entire infected communities from each other, by threat of police force if necessary. Yan's promotion of germ theory and his enforcement of physical isolation to reduce the effect of epidemics was not completely accepted by the local population, and in some areas the local people resisted these measures.<ref>Harrison 62</ref>\n\nYan's determination to modernize Shanxi was partly inspired by his interactions with the foreign doctors and personnel who arrived in Shanxi in 1918 in order to help him suppress the epidemic. He was impressed with the zeal, talents and modern outlook of these personnel, and subsequently compared foreigners favorably to his own conservative and generally apathetic officials. Conversations with other famous reformers, including [[John Dewey]], [[Hu Shih]] and Yan's close friend [[H.H. Kung]], reinforced his determination to Westernize Shanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 22</ref>\n\nYan attempted to modernize the state of medicine in China by funding the Research Society for the Advancement of Chinese Medicine, based in Taiyuan, in 1921. Highly unusual in China at the time, the school had a four-year curriculum and included courses in both Chinese and Western Medicine. Its courses were taught in English, German, and Japanese. The main skills that Yan hoped physicians trained at the school would learn were: a standardized system of diagnosis; sanitary science, including bacteriology; surgical skills, including obstetrics; and, the use of diagnostic instruments. Yan hoped that his support of the school would eventually lead to increased revenues in the domestic and international trade of Chinese drugs, improved public health, and improved public education. Yan's interest in having such a school active in Shanxi was sparked after staying in a Western hospital in Japan for three months, in which he was impressed by seeing modern medical equipment, including x-rays and microscopes, for the first time.<ref>Andrews 171-172</ref><ref name=\"Har61\">Harrison 61</ref>\n\nYan continued to promote a tradition of Chinese medicine that was informed by Western medical science throughout his period of governance, but much of the teaching and publication that this school of medicine produced was limited to the area around Taiyuan: by 1949 three of the seven government-run hospitals were in the city. In 1934 the province produced a ten-year-plan that envisaged employing a hygiene worker in every village, but the advent of WWII and the subsequent civil war made it impossible to carry these plans out.<ref>Harrison 63</ref>\n\n===Involvement in the Northern Expedition===\n{{Main article|Northern Expedition}}\n[[File:Yen's Soldiers, Militarism In China, Here Are Specimens Of The Soldiery Who Protect The People By Dominating Them, Who Protect Property By Looting It, Liao Chow, Shansi, China (c1925) IE Oberholtzer (probable) (RESTORED) (4072600660).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Yan Xishan's soldiers in Liaozhou (now [[Zuoquan County]]) in 1925 during the war with Henan warlord Fan Zhongxiu.]]\nIn order to maintain Shanxi's neutrality and free it from serious military confrontations with rival warlords, Yan developed a strategy of shifting alliances between various warring cliques, inevitably joining only winning sides. Although he was weaker than many of the warlords that surrounded him, he often held the balance of power between neighboring rivals, and even those that he betrayed hesitated to retaliate against him in case they might need his support in the future. In order to resist the domination of Manchurian warlord [[Zhang Zuolin]], Yan allied himself with the forces of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in 1927, during the Nationalists' [[Northern Expedition]]. While aiding Chiang, Yan's occupation of Beijing in June 1928 brought the Northern Expedition to a successful conclusion.<ref name=\"Portrait5\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 293</ref>  Yan's assistance to Chiang was rewarded shortly afterwards by his being named Minister of the Interior<ref>''TIME Magazine'' Dec. 24, 1928. p.293</ref> and deputy commander-in-chief of all Kuomintang armies<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 111</ref> Yan's support for Chiang's military campaigns and his [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|suppression of Communists]] influenced Chiang to recognize Yan as the governor of Shanxi, and to allow him to expand his influence into [[Hebei]].<ref name=\"W399\" />\n\n===Involvement in the Central Plains War===\n{{Main article|Central Plains War}}\n[[File:Yen Hsi-shan TIME Cover.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Yan Xishan--\"China's Next President\".]]\nYan's alliance with Chiang was interrupted in 1929 when Yan joined Chiang's enemies to establish an alternative national government in northern China. His allies included the northern warlord [[Feng Yuxiang]], the [[New Guangxi clique|Guangxi Clique]] led by [[Li Zongren]], and the left-leaning Kuomintang faction led by [[Wang Jingwei]]. While Feng and Chiang's armies were annihilating each other, Yan marched virtually unopposed through [[Shandong]], capturing the provincial capital of [[Jinan]] in June 1930. After these victories Yan attempted to forge a new national government, with himself as President, by calling an \"Enlarged Party Conference\". Under his plan Yan was to be president and Wang Jingwei was to serve as his prime minister. This conference attempted to draft a national constitution and involved the participation of numerous high-ranking Chinese militarists and politicians from among Chiang's rivals. These deliberations were interrupted by Chiang who, after decisively defeating Feng's armies, invaded Shandong and virtually annihilated Yan's army. When the governor of Manchuria, [[Zhang Xueliang]], publicly declared his allegiance to Chiang (whose support Zhang required in order to contest the Russians and Japanese), Yan fled to [[Dalian]] in the Japanese-held [[Kwantung Leased Territory]], only returning to an unconquered Shanxi after making peace with Chiang in 1931.<ref name=\"W399\" /><ref name=\"Portrait5\" /><ref>''TIME Magazine'' Sep. 29, 1930</ref>  During this \"[[Central Plains War]]\", the [[Kuomintang]] encouraged Muslims and Mongols to overthrow both [[Feng Yuxiang]] and Yan.<ref>Lin 22</ref>  Chiang's defeat of Yan and Feng in 1930 is considered the end of China's [[Warlord Era]].\n\nThe events between 1927-31 are best explained as the strategies of warlords accustomed to the constantly shifting, chaotic alliances that had characterized Chinese politics since the breakdown of the central government a decade earlier. The main cause of Yan's defeat was the low population and lack of development in the areas that he had under his control, making him incapable of fielding a large and well-equipped army similar to the ones commanded by Chiang at the time.<ref name=\"Portrait5\" /> Yan was also unable to match the quality of leadership in Chiang's officer corps and the prestige that Chiang and the Nationalist army possessed at the time.<ref name=\"Portrait6\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 294</ref> Before Chiang's armies defeated Feng and Yan, Yan Xishan appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]], with the subtitle \"China's Next President.\"<ref>''TIME Magazine''. May 19, 1930</ref>  The attention given to him by foreign observers in this period, and the support and assistance that he had secured from other high-profile Chinese statesmen, implies that there was a credible expectation that Yan would lead a central government if Chiang failed to defeat Yan's alliance.\n\n===Return to Shanxi===\nYan was only able to return to Shanxi through a complex effort of intrigue and politicking. Much of Chiang's failure to immediately and permanently eject Yan or his subordinates from Shanxi was due largely to the influence of Zhang Xueliang and the Japanese, who were anxious to prevent the extension of Chiang's authority into Manchuria. In Yan's absence the civil government of Shanxi ground to a halt, and the various military leaders of Shanxi struggled with each other to fill the vacuum, forcing Chiang's government to appoint Shanxi's leaders from among Yan's subordinates. Although he did not immediately declare his return to provincial politics, Yan returned to Shanxi in 1931 with the support and protection of Zhang. This move was not protested by Chiang due to his involvement in suppressing the forces of [[Li Zongren]], who had marched up to northern [[Hunan]] from his base in [[Guangxi]] in support of Yan.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 118-122</ref>\n\nYan remained in the background of Shanxi politics until the Nanjing government's failure to resist the Japanese takeover of Manchuria after the [[Mukden Incident]] gave Yan and his followers an opportunity to informally overthrow the Kuomintang in Shanxi. On December 18, 1931, a group of students (supported and perhaps orchestrated by officials loyal to Yan) gathered in Taiyuan to protest the Nanjing government's policy of not fighting the Japanese. This demonstration became so violent that Kuomintang police fired into the crowd. The public outrage that this \"Massacre of December Eighteenth\" generated was strong enough to give Yan's officials a pretext to expel the Kuomintang from the province on the grounds of public safety. After this event the Kuomintang ceased to exist in Shanxi except as a dummy organization whose members were more loyal to Yan than to Chiang Kai-shek.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 122-123</ref>\n\nFuture difficulties in securing the loyalty of other Chinese warlords across China, the ongoing civil war with the Communists and the ongoing threat of Japanese invasion motivated Chiang to let Yan retain the title of Pacification Commissioner in 1932, and he appointed Yan to the central government's [[Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission]]. In 1934 Chiang finally flew to Taiyuan, where he praised Yan's administration in return for Yan's public support for Nanjing. By publicly praising Yan's government, Chiang in effect admitted that Yan remained the undisputed ruler of Shanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 123-124</ref>\n\n===Subsequent relationship with the Nationalist government===\nAfter 1931, Yan continued to give nominal support to the Nanjing government while maintaining de facto control over Shanxi, alternatively cooperating with and fighting against Communist agents active in his province. Although he was not an active participant, Yan supported the 1936 [[Xi'an Incident]], in which Chiang Kai-shek was arrested by Nationalist officers led by [[Zhang Xueliang]] and [[Yang Hucheng]] and released only when he agreed to make peace with the Communists and form a [[Second United Front|\"united front\"]] to resist the impending Japanese invasion of China. In his correspondence with [[Zhang Xueliang]] in 1936 Yan indicated that the growing rift between him and Chiang was due to Yan's anxieties over the potential for a Japanese invasion and a concern for the subsequent fate of China, and because Yan was not convinced of the correctness of focusing China's resources on anti-Communist campaigns.<ref name=\"Spence1\" /> During the Xian Incident itself Yan actively involved himself in the negotiations, sending representatives to prevent Chiang's execution (and the civil war that Yan believed would follow) while pushing for a united front to resist the Japanese invasion of China that Yan believed was imminent.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 239-241</ref>\n\nThe financial relationship between Shanxi and the central government remained complicated. Yan was successful in creating a complex of heavy industries around Taiyuan, but neglected to publicize the extent of his success outside of Shanxi, probably to deceive Chiang Kai-shek. Despite his measured successes in modernizing the industry of Shanxi, Yan repeatedly petitioned the central government for financial assistance in order to extend the local railroad, and for other reasons, but his requests were usually denied. When Yan refused to send taxes collected from the trade of salt (produced in Shanxi's public factories) to the central government, Chiang retaliated by flooding the market of northern China with so much salt (produced around coastal China) that the price of salt in China's northern provinces dropped extremely low: due to these artificially low salt prices, neighboring provinces virtually stopped purchasing Shanxi salt altogether. In 1935 Chiang's announcement of a \"five-year plan\" to modernize Chinese industry was perhaps inspired by the successes of the \"Ten-Year Plan\" that Yan had announced several years before.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 193</ref>\n\n==Public policies==\nIn Shanxi, Yan implemented numerous successful reforms in an effort to centralize his control over the province.  Although embracing the traditional values of the landed gentry, he denounced their \"oppression\" of the peasantry and took steps to initiate [[land reform]] and weaken the power of landowners over the populace in the countryside. These reforms also weakened potential rivals in his province, in addition to benefiting Shanxi farmers.<ref name=\"Portrait1\" />\n\nYan attempted to develop his army as a locally recruited force which cultivated a public image of being servants, rather than masters, of the people. He developed an all-encompassing, idiosyncratic ideology (literally \"Yan Xishan Thought\") and disseminated it by sponsoring a network of village newspapers and traveling dramatic troupes. He coordinated dramatic public meetings in which participants confessed their own misdeeds and/or denounced those of others. He devised a system of [[public education]], producing a population of trained workers and farmers literate enough to be indoctrinated without difficulty. The early date by which Yan devised and implemented these reforms (during the Warlord Era) contradicts later claims that these reforms were modeled on Communist programs and not vice versa.<ref name=\"Portrait2\" />\n\n===Military policies===\nWhen Yan returned from Japan in 1909, he was a firm proponent of [[militarism]], and proposed a system of national conscription along German and Japanese lines. Germany's defeat in [[World War I]] and Yan's defeat in [[Henan]] in 1919 caused him to reassess the value of militarism as a way of life. He then decreased the size of the army until 1923 (in order to save money), until a rumor circulated that rival warlords were planning on invading Shanxi. Yan then introduced military reforms designed to train a rural militia of 100,000 men, along the lines of Japanese and American reserves.<ref name=\"Gillin Warlord 24\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 24</ref>\n\nYan attempted, via conscription, to create a civilian reserve that would become the foundation of society in Shanxi. His troops were perhaps the only army in the Warlord era drawn exclusively from the province in which they were stationed, and because he insisted that his soldiers perform work to improve Shanxi's infrastructure\u2014including road-maintenance and assisting farmers\u2014and because his discipline ensured that his soldiers actually paid for anything they took from civilians, the army in Shanxi enjoyed much more popular support than most of his rivals' armies in China.<ref name=\"Portrait6\" />\n\nYan's officer corps was drawn from Shanxi's gentry and given two years of education at government expense. Despite efforts to subject his officers to a rigorous, Japanese-style training regimen and to indoctrinate them in Yan Xishan Thought, his armies never proved to be especially well-trained or disciplined in battle. In general, Yan's military record is not considered positive\u2014he had more defeats than victories\u2014and it is unclear whether his  officer corps either understood or sympathized with his objectives, instead entering his service solely in the interests of achieving prestige and a higher standard of living. Yan built an arsenal in Taiyuan that, for the entire period of his administration, remained the only center in China capable of producing field artillery. The presence of this arsenal was one of the main reasons that Yan was able to maintain Shanxi's relative independence.<ref name=\"Portrait6\" /> While not particularly effective fighting rival warlords, Yan's army was successful in eradicating banditry in Shanxi, allowing him to maintain a relatively high level of public order and security.<ref name=\"Portrait7\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 295</ref>  Yan's successes in eradicating banditry in Shanxi include his cooperation with Yuan Shikai to defeat Bai Lang's remnant rebels after the failed 1913-14 [[Bai Lang Rebellion]].\n\n===Attempts at social reform===\nYan went to great lengths to eradicate social traditions which he considered antiquated. He insisted that all men in Shanxi abandon their Qing-era queues, giving police instructions to clip off the queues of anyone still wearing them. In one instance, Yan lured people into theatres in order to have his police systematically cut the hair of the audience.<ref name=\"Portrait7\" /> He attempted to combat widespread female illiteracy by creating in each district at least one vocational school in which peasant girls could be given a primary-school education and taught domestic skills. After Kuomintang military victories in 1925 generated great interest in Shanxi for the Nationalist ideology, including [[women's rights]], Yan allowed girls to enroll in middle school and college, where they promptly formed a women's association.<ref name=\"Gillin Warlord 24\"/>\n\nYan attempted to eradicate the custom of [[foot binding]], threatening to sentence men who married women with bound feet, and mothers who bound their daughters' feet, to hard labor in state-run factories. He discouraged the use of the traditional [[lunar calendar]] and encouraged the development of local [[boy scout organizations]]. Like the Communists who later succeeded Yan, he punished habitual lawbreakers to \"redemption through labour\" in state-run factories.<ref name=\"Portrait7\" />\n\n===Attempts to eradicate opium use===\nIn 1916, at least 10% of Shanxi's 11 million people were addicted to [[opium]], and Yan attempted to eradicate opium use in Shanxi after he came to power. At first, he dealt with opium dealers and addicts severely, throwing addicts in prison and exposing them and their families to public humiliation. Many convicted of opium-related offenses then died of sudden withdrawal from the drug. After 1922, partly due to public opposition to harsh punishment, Yan abandoned punishing addicts in favor of attempting to rehabilitate them, pressuring individuals through their families, and constructing sanitariums designed to slowly cure addicts of their addictions.<ref name=\"Warlord1\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 38-40</ref>\n\nYan's attempts to suppress the opium trade in Shanxi were largely successful, and the number of opium addicts in the province was reduced by 80% by 1922. In the absence of efforts by other warlords to combat opium production and trade, Yan's efforts to combat opium use only increased the price of opium so much that narcotics of all kinds were drawn into Shanxi from other provinces. Users often switched from opium to pills mixed from [[morphine]] and [[heroin]], which were easier to smuggle and use. Because the most influential and powerful gentry in Shanxi were often the worst offenders, officials drawn from the privileged class of Shanxi seldom enforced Yan's decrees outlawing the use of narcotics, and often evaded punishment themselves. Eventually Yan was forced to abandon his efforts to suppress opium trafficking, and attempted instead to establish a [[government monopoly]] on the production and sale of opium in Shanxi.<ref name=\"Warlord1\" /> Yan continued to complain about the availability of narcotics into the 1930s, and after 1932 executed over 600 people caught smuggling drugs into Shanxi. The traffic persisted, but Yan's interests in opposing it were perhaps limited by a fear of provoking the Japanese, who manufactured most of the morphine and heroin available in China inside their [[Concessions in China|concession area]] in [[Tianjin]], and who came to control much of the drug trade in northern China in the 1930s.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 138</ref>\n\n===Limitations of economic reforms===\nYan's efforts to stimulate Shanxi's economy mostly consisted of state-led investment in a broad variety of industries, and he generally failed to encourage private investment and trade. Though gains were made to improve the economy of Shanxi, his efforts were limited by the fact that he himself had little formal training in economic or industrial theory. He also suffered from a lack of experienced, trained advisers capable of directing even moderately complicated tasks related to economic development. Because most of the educated staff that he did have access to were solidly entrenched within the landed gentry of Shanxi, it is possible that many of his officials may have deliberately sabotaged his efforts for reform, preferring that the peasants working their fields continue their cheap, traditional labour.<ref>Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 305</ref>\n\n==Yan Xishan Thought==\nThroughout his life Yan Xishan attempted to identify, formulate and disseminate a comprehensive ideology that would improve the morale and loyalty of his officials and the people of Shanxi. During his time of study in Japan, Yan became attracted to [[militarism]] and [[Social Darwinism]], but he renounced these after World War I. Throughout the rest of Yan's life he identified with the position of most Chinese conservatives at the time: that social and economic reform would progress from ethical reform, and that the problems confronting China could only be solved by the moral rehabilitation of the Chinese people.<ref name =Warlord59>Gillin ''Warlord'' 59</ref>  Believing that no single ideology existed to unify the Chinese people at the time that he came to power, Yan attempted to generate an ideal ideology himself, and once boasted that he had succeeded in creating a comprehensive system of belief that embodied the best features of \"militarism, nationalism, anarchism, democracy, capitalism, communism, individualism, imperialism, universalism, paternalism and utopianism\".<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 63</ref>  Much of Yan's attempts to spread his ideology were through a network of semi-religious organizations known as \"Heart-Washing Societies\".\n\n===Influence of Confucianism===\nYan was emotionally attached to [[Confucianism]] by virtue of his upbringing, and because he identified its values as a historically effective solution to the chaos and disorder of his time. He justified his rule via Confucian political theories and attempted to revive Confucian virtues as being universally accepted. In his speeches and writing Yan developed an extravagant admiration for the virtues of moderation and harmony associated with the Confucian [[Doctrine of the Mean]]. Many of the reforms that Yan attempted were undertaken with the intention of demonstrating that he was a ''junzi'', the epitome of Confucian virtue.<ref name=\"Warlord59\" />\n\nYan's interpretations of Confucianism were mostly borrowed from the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]] that was popular in the Qing dynasty. He taught that everyone had a capacity for innate goodness, but that in order to fulfill this capacity people had to subordinate their emotions and desires to the control of their conscience. He admired the [[Ming dynasty]] philosophers [[Lu Jiuyuan]] and [[Wang Yangming]], who disparaged knowledge and urged men to act on the basis of their intuition. Because Yan believed that human beings could only achieve their potentials through intense self-criticism and self-cultivation, he established in every town a Heart-Washing Society, whose members gathered each Sunday to meditate and listen to sermons based on the themes of the Confucian classics. Everyone at these meetings was supposed to rise and confess aloud his misdeeds of the past week, inviting criticism from the other members.<ref name =\"Warlord60\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 60</ref>\n\n===Influence of Christianity===\nYan attributed much of the West's vitality to Christianity, and believed that China could only resist and overtake the West by generating an ideological tradition that was equally inspiring. He appreciated the efforts of missionaries (mostly Americans who maintained a complex of schools in [[Taigu County|Taigu]]) to educate and modernize Shanxi. He regularly addressed the graduating classes of these schools, but was generally unsuccessful in recruiting these students to serve his regime. Yan supported the indigenous Christian church in Taiyuan, and at one time seriously considered using Christian chaplains in his army. His public support of Christianity waned after 1925, when he failed to come to the defense of Christians during anti-foreigner and anti-Christian demonstrations that polarized Taiyuan.<ref name =\"Warlord61\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 61-62</ref>\n\nYan deliberately organized many features of his Heart-Washing Society on the Christian church, including ending each service with hymns praising Confucius. He urged his subjects to place their faith in a supreme being that he called \"''Shangdi''\": he justified his belief in ''Shangdi'' via the Confucian classics, but described ''Shangdi'' in terms very similar to the Christian interpretation of God. Like Christianity, Yan Xishan Thought was permeated with the belief that, through accepting his ideology, people could become regenerated or reborn.<ref name =\"Warlord61\" />\n\n===Influence of Chinese Nationalism===\nIn 1911, Yan came to power in Shanxi as a disciple of Chinese nationalism, but subsequently came to view nationalism as merely another set of ideas that could be used to achieve his own objectives. He stated that the primary goal of the Heart-Washing Society was to encourage Chinese patriotism by reviving the Confucian church, leading foreigners to accuse him of attempting to create a Chinese version of [[Shinto]].<ref name =\"Warlord63\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 63-64</ref>\n\nYan attempted to moderate some aspects of [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ideology that he viewed as potentially threatening to his rule. Yan altered some of Sun's doctrines before disseminating them in Shanxi, formulating his own version of Sun's [[Three Principles of the People]] that replaced the principles of nationalism and democracy with the principles of virtue and knowledge. During the 1919 [[May Fourth Movement]], when students in Taiyuan staged anti-foreign demonstrations, Yan warned that patriotism, like rainfall, was beneficial only when moderate.<ref name =\"Warlord63\" />\n\nAfter the [[Kuomintang]] succeeded in forming a nominal central government in 1930, Yan encouraged Nationalist principles that he viewed as socially beneficial. During the 1930s he attempted to set up in every village a \"Good People's Movement\" in order to promote the values of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[New Life Movement]]. These values included honesty, friendliness, dignity, diligence, modesty, thrift, personal neatness and obedience.<ref name =\"Warlord60\" />.\n\n===Influence of socialism and communism===\nIn 1931 Yan returned from his exile in Dalian impressed with the apparent successes of Soviet Union's [[first five-year plan]], and attempted to reorganize the economy of Shanxi using Soviet methods, according to a local \"Ten-Year Plan\" that Yan himself developed.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 129</ref> Throughout the 1930s Yan bluntly equated economic development with state control of industry and finance, and he was successful in bringing most major industry and commerce under state control by the late 1930s.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 134</ref>\n\nYan's speeches after 1931 reflect an interpretation of [[Marxist economics]] (mostly drawn from ''[[Das Kapital]]'') that he gained while in exile in Dalian. Following this interpretation, Yan attempted to change the economy of Shanxi to become more like that of the [[USSR]], inspiring a scheme of economic \"distribution according to labour\". When the threat of Chinese Communists became a significant threat to Yan's rule, he defended the Communists as courageous and self-sacrificing fanatics who were different from common bandits (contrary to Kuomintang propaganda) and whose challenge must be met by social and economic reforms that alleviated the conditions responsible for communism.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 163-164</ref>\n\nLike [[Karl Marx|Marx]], Yan wanted to eliminate what he saw as unearned profit by restructuring Shanxi's economy to reward only those who worked. Unlike Marx, Yan reinterpreted Communism to correct what he believed was [[Marxism]]'s chief flaw: the inevitability of [[Class conflict|class warfare]]. Yan praised Marx for his analysis of the material aspects of human society, but professed to believe that there was a moral and spiritual unity of mankind that implied that a state of harmony was closer to the human ideal than conflict. By rejecting [[economic determinism]] in favor of morality and free will, Yan hoped to create a society that would be more productive and less violent than he perceived communism to be, while avoiding the exploitation and human misery that he believed was the inevitable result of capitalism.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 164</ref>\n\nYan interpreted [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt's]] [[New Deal]] as promoting socialism in order to combat the spread of communism. \"The New Deal is an effective way of stopping communism,\" Yan said, \"by having the government step in and ride roughshod over the interests of the rich.\" Yan then undertook a series of public works projects inspired by the New Deal in order to reduce unemployment in his own province.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 166-167.</ref>\n\n===Extent of success===\nIn spite of his efforts, Yan did not succeed in making Yan Xishan Thought widely popular in Shanxi, and most of his subjects refused to believe that his true objectives differed substantially from those of past regimes. Yan himself blamed the failure of his ideology to become popular on the faults of his officials, charging that they abused their power and failed to explain his ideas to the common people. In general, the officials of Shanxi misappropriated funds intended to be used for propaganda, attempted to explain Yan's ideas in language too sophisticated for the common people and often behaved in a dictatorial manner that discredited Yan's ideology and failed to generate popular enthusiasm for his regime.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 65-66</ref>\n\n==Threats to Yan's rule==\n\n===Early conflict with Japan===\nYan did not come into serious conflict with the Japanese until the early 1930s. While he was in exile in Dalian in 1930, Yan became aware of [[Mukden Incident|Japanese plans to invade Manchuria]], and feigned collaboration with the Japanese in order to pressure Chiang Kai-shek into allowing him to return to Shanxi before warning Chiang of Japan's intent. Japan's subsequent success in taking Manchuria in 1931 terrified Yan, who stated that a major objective of his Ten-Year Plan was to strengthen Shanxi's defense against the Japanese. In the early 1930s he supported anti-Japanese riots, denounced the Japanese occupation of Manchuria as \"barbarous\" and \"evil\", publicly appealed to Chiang to send troops to Manchuria and arranged for his arsenal to arm partisans fighting the Japanese occupation in Manchuria.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 211</ref>\n\nIn December 1931 Yan was warned that, after taking control of Manchuria, the Japanese would attempt to take control of [[Inner Mongolia]] by subverting Chinese authority in [[Chahar Province|Chahar]] and [[Suiyuan]]. In order to prevent this, he took control of Suiyuan first, developing its large iron deposits (24% of all iron in China), and settling the province with thousands of soldier-farmers. When the [[Manchukuo Imperial Army]] (armed and led by the Japanese) finally invaded Chahar in 1935, Yan virtually declared war on the Japanese by accepting a position as \"advisor\" of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council, an organization created by the central government to organize  opposition to the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 212-214</ref>\n\nThe Japanese began promoting \"autonomy\" for northern China in the summer of 1935. Apparently, many high-ranking Japanese in China believed that Yan and many others in the north were fundamentally pro-Japanese and would readily subordinate themselves to the Japanese in exchange for protection from Chiang Kai-shek. Yan published an [[open letter]] in September in which he accused the Japanese of desiring to conquer all of China over the next two decades. According to Japanese sources, Yan entered into negotiations with the Japanese in 1935, but was never very enthusiastic about \"autonomy\" and rejected their overtures when he realized that they intended to make him their puppet. Yan likely used these negotiations to frighten Chiang Kai-shek into using his armies to defend Shanxi, since he was afraid that Chiang was preparing to sacrifice northern China to avoid fighting the Japanese. If these were Yan's intentions they were successful, as Chiang assured Yan that he would defend Shanxi with his army in the event that it was invaded.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 216-218</ref>\n\n===Early conflict with the Chinese Communist Party===\nAlthough Yan admired its philosophy and economic methods, he feared the threat posed by Chinese communists almost as much as the Japanese. In the early 1930s he observed that, if it invaded Shanxi, the [[People's Liberation Army|Red Army]] would enjoy the support of 70% of his subjects, and would readily be able to recruit one million men from among the most desperate citizens of Shanxi. He remarked that \"the job of suppressing communism is 70% political and only 30% military, while the job of preventing its growth altogether is 90%  political.\" In order to prevent a Communist threat to Shanxi, Yan sent troops to fight the Communists in [[Jiangxi\u2013Fujian Soviet|Jiangxi]] and (later) [[Shaanxi]], organized the gentry and village authorities into anti-corruption and anti-communist political organizations and attempted (mostly unsuccessfully) to undertake a large-scale program of land reform.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 218-220</ref>\n\nThese reforms did not prevent the spread of Communist guerrilla operations into Shanxi. Led by [[Liu Zhidan]] and [[Xu Haidong]], 34,000 Communist troops crossed into southwestern Shanxi in February 1936. As Yan predicted, the Communists enjoyed massive popular support and, although they were outnumbered and ill-armed, succeeded in occupying the southern third of Shanxi in less than a month. The Communists' strategy of [[guerrilla warfare]] was extremely effective against, and demoralizing for, Yan's forces, who repeatedly fell victim to surprise attacks. The Communists in Shanxi made good use of cooperation supplied by local peasants to evade and easily locate Yan's forces. When reinforcements sent by the central government forced the Communists to withdraw from Shanxi, the Red Army escaped by splitting into small groups that were actively supplied and hidden by local supporters. Yan himself admitted that his troops had fought poorly during the campaign. The KMT forces that remained in Shanxi expressed hostility to Yan's rule, but did not interfere with his governance.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 220-221</ref>\n\n===Invasion by Mengguguo===\nIn March 1936, [[Manchukuo]] troops occupying the [[Inner Mongolia]]n province of [[Chahar Province|Chahar]] invaded northeastern [[Suiyuan]], which Yan controlled. These Japanese-aligned forces seized the city of [[Bailingmiao]] in northern Suiyuan, where the pro-Japanese [[Inner Mongolian Autonomous Political Council]] maintained its headquarters. Three months later the head of the Political Council, [[Demchugdongrub|Prince De (Demchugdongrub)]], declared that he was the ruler of an independent Mongolia ([[Mengjiang|Mengguguo]]), and organized an army with the aid of Japanese equipment and training. In August 1936 Prince De's army attempted to invade eastern Suiyuan, but it was defeated by Yan's forces under the command of [[Fu Zuoyi]]. Following this defeat, Prince De planned another invasion while Japanese agents carefully sketched and photographed Suiyuan's defenses.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 230</ref>\n\nTo prepare for the imminent threat of Japanese invasion that he felt after Suiyuan was invaded, Yan attempted to force all students to undergo several months of compulsive military training and formed an informal alliance with the Communists for the purpose of fighting the Japanese, several months before the [[Xi'an Incident]] compelled Chiang Kai-shek to do the same. In November 1936 the army of Prince De presented Fu Zuoyi with an ultimatum to surrender. When Fu responded that Prince De was merely a puppet of \"certain quarters\" and requested that he submit to the authority of the central government, Prince De's Mongolian and Manchurian armies launched another, more ambitious attack. Prince De's 15,000 soldiers were armed with Japanese weapons, supported by Japanese aircraft and often led by Japanese officers (Japanese soldiers fighting for Mengguguo were often executed after their capture as illegal combatants, since Mengguguo was not recognized as being part of Japan).<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 230-234</ref>\n\nIn anticipation of this war, Japanese spies destroyed a large supply depot in [[Datong]] and carried out other acts of sabotage. Yan placed his best troops and most able generals, including [[Zhao Chengshou]] and Yan's son-in-law, [[Wang Jingguo]], under the command of Fu Zuoyi. During the month of fighting that ensued, the army of Mengguguo suffered severe casualties. Fu's forces succeeded in retaking Bailingmiao on November 24 and he was considering invading Chahar before he was warned by the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] that doing so would provoke an attack by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Prince De's forces repeatedly attempted to retake Bailingmiao, but this only provoked Fu into sending troops north, where he successfully seized the last of Prince De's bases in Suiyuan and virtually annihilated his army. After Japanese officers were found to be aiding Prince De, Yan publicly accused Japan of aiding the invaders. His victories in Suiyuan over Japanese-backed forces were praised by Chinese newspapers and magazines, other warlords and political leaders, and many students and members of the Chinese public.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 234-236</ref>\n\n==The Second Sino-Japanese War==\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u201345), most regions of Shanxi were quickly overrun by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], but Yan refused to flee the province even after losing the provincial capital, Taiyuan. He relocated his headquarters to a remote corner of the province, effectively resisting Japanese attempts to completely seize Shanxi. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese made no less than five attempts to negotiate peace terms with Yan and hoped that he would become a second [[Wang Jingwei]], but Yan refused and stayed on the Chinese side.\n\n===Alliance with the Communists===\nAfter the failed attempt by the [[Chinese Red Army]] to establish bases in southern Shanxi in early 1936, the subsequent continued presence of Nationalist soldiers there and the Japanese attempts to take Suiyuan that summer, Yan became convinced that the Communists were lesser threats to his rule than either the Nationalists or the Japanese. He then negotiated a secret anti-Japanese \"united front\" with the Communists in October 1936 and, after the [[Xi'an Incident]] two months later, successfully influenced Chiang Kai-shek to enter into a similar agreement with the Communists. After establishing his alliance with the Communists Yan lifted the ban on Communist activities in Shanxi.<ref>Feng and Goodman 156-157</ref> He allowed Communist agents working under [[Zhou Enlai]] to establish a secret headquarters in Taiyuan,<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 263</ref> and released Communists that he had been holding in prison (including at least one general, Wang Ruofei).<ref>Wortzel 33</ref>\n\nYan, under the slogan \"resistance against the enemy and defense of the soil\", attempted to recruit young, patriotic intellectuals to his government in order to organize a local resistance to the threat of Japanese invasion. By 1936 Taiyuan had become a gathering point for anti-Japanese intellectuals who had fled from [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]] and [[northeast China]] who readily cooperated with Yan, but he also recruited natives of Shanxi who were living across China regardless of their former political associations. Some Shanxi officials attracted to Yan's cause in the late 1930s later became important figures in the Chinese government, including [[Bo Yibo]].<ref>Feng and Goodman 157-158</ref>\n\n===Early campaigns===\nIn July 1937, after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] provoked the Japanese into attacking Chinese forces in and around Beijing, the Japanese sent a large number of warplanes and Manchurian soldiers to reinforce Prince De's army. This caused Yan to believe that a Japanese invasion of Shanxi was imminent, and he flew to Nanjing to communicate the situation to Chiang Kai-shek. Yan left his meeting in Nanjing with an appointment as commander of the Second War Zone, comprising Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar and northern Shaanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 257</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Shanxi, Yan encouraged his officials to be suspicious of enemy spies and ''[[hanjian]]'', and ordered his forces to attack Prince De's forces in northern Chahar, hoping to surprise and overwhelm them quickly. The Mongolian and Manchu forces were quickly routed, and Japanese reinforcements attempting to force their way through the strategic Nankou pass suffered heavy casualties. Overwhelming Japanese firepower\u2014including artillery, bombers and tanks\u2014eventually forced Yan's forces to surrender Nankou, after which Japanese forces quickly seized Suiyuan and Datong. The Japanese then began the invasion of Shanxi in earnest.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 257-259</ref>\n\nAs the Japanese advanced southward into Taiyuan Basin, Yan attempted to impose discipline on his army by executing Gen. [[Li Fuying]] and other officers guilty of retreating from the enemy. He issued orders not to withdraw or surrender under any circumstances, vowed to resist Japan until the Japanese had been defeated and invited his own soldiers to kill him if he betrayed his promise. In the face of continued Japanese advances Yan apologized to the central government for his army's defeats, asked it to assume responsibility for the defense of Shanxi and agreed to share control of the provincial government with one of Chiang Kai-shek's representatives.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 262-263</ref>\n\nWhen it became clear to Yan that his forces might not be successful in repelling the Japanese army, he invited Communist military forces to re-enter Shanxi. [[Zhu De]] became the commander of the [[Eighth Route Army]] active in Shanxi and was named the vice-commander of the Second War Zone, under Yan himself. Yan initially responded warmly to the re-entry of the arrival of Communist forces, and they were greeted with enthusiasm by Yan's officials and officers. Communist forces arrived in Shanxi just in time to help defeat a decisively more powerful Japanese force attempting to move through the strategic mountain pass of [[Battle of Pingxingguan|Pingxingguan]]. After the Japanese responded to this defeat by outflanking the defenders and moving towards Taiyuan, the Communists avoided decisive battles and mostly attempted to harass Japanese forces and sabotage Japanese lines of supply and communication. The Japanese suffered, but mostly ignored the Eighth Route Army and continued to advance towards Yan's capital. The lack of attention directed at their forces gave the Communists time to recruit and propagandize among the local peasant populations (who generally welcomed Communist forces enthusiastically) and to organize a network of militia units, local guerrilla bands and popular mass organizations.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 263-264</ref>\n\nGenuine Communist efforts to resist the Japanese gave them the authority to carry out sweeping and radical social and economic reforms, mostly related to land and wealth redistribution, which they defended by labeling those who resisted as ''[[hanjian]]''. Communist efforts to resist the Japanese also won over Shanxi's small population of patriotic intellectuals, and conservative fears of resisting them effectively gave the Communists unlimited access to the rural population. Subsequent atrocities committed by the Japanese in the effort to rid Shanxi of Communist guerrillas aroused the hatred of millions in the Shanxi countryside, causing the rural population to turn to the Communists for leadership against the Japanese. All of these factors explain how, within a year of re-entering Shanxi, the Communists were able to take control of most of Shanxi not firmly held by the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 271</ref>\n\n===Fall of Taiyuan===\n[[File:Chinese troops marching in Xinkou.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Chinese troops marching to defend the mountain pass at Xinkou.]]\nBy executing commanders guilty of retreating, Yan succeeded in improving the morale of his forces. During the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] Yan's troops in Shanxi successfully resisted numerous Japanese assaults, while the Eighth Route Army harassed the Japanese from the rear and along their flanks. Other units of Yan's army successfully defended other nearby passes. After the Japanese successfully broke into the Taiyan Basin, they continued to encounter ferocious resistance. At [[Yuanping, Shanxi|Yuanping]], a single brigade of Yan's troops held out against the Japanese advance for over a week, allowing reinforcements sent by the central government to take up defensive positions at [[Battle of Xinkou|Xinkou]]. The Communist generals Zhu De and [[Peng Dehuai]] criticized Yan for what they called \"suicidal tactics\", but Yan was confident that the heavy losses suffered by the Japanese would eventually demoralize them, forcing them to abandon their effort to take Shanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 271-272</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Xinkou]], the Chinese defenders resisted the efforts of Japan's elite [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki|Itakagi Division]] for over a month, despite Japanese advantages in artillery and air support. By the end of October 1937, Japan's losses were four times greater than those suffered at Pingxingguan, and the Itakagi Division was close to defeat. Contemporary Communist accounts called the battle \"the most fierce in North China\", while Japanese accounts called the battle a \"stalemate\". In an effort to save their forces at Xinkou, Japanese forces began an effort to occupy Shanxi from a second direction, in the east. After a week of fighting, Japanese forces captured the strategic [[Niangzi Pass]], opening the way to capturing Taiyuan. Communist guerrilla tactics were ineffective in slowing down the Japanese advance. The defenders at Xinkou, realizing that they were in danger of being outflanked, withdrew southward, past Taiyuan, leaving a small force of 6,000 men to hold off the entire Japanese army.. A representative of the Japanese Army, speaking of [[Battle of Taiyuan|the final defense of Taiyuan]], said that \"nowhere in China have the Chinese fought so obstinately\".<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 272-273</ref>\n\nThe Japanese suffered 30,000 dead and an equal number wounded in their effort to take northern Shanxi. A Japanese study found that the battles of Pingxingguan, Xinkou, and Taiyuan were responsible for over half of all the casualties suffered by the Japanese army in North China. Yan himself was forced to withdraw after having 90% of his army destroyed, including a large force of reinforcements sent into Shanxi by the central government. Throughout 1937, numerous high-ranking Communist leaders, including [[Mao Zedong]], lavished praise on Yan for waging an uncompromising campaign of resistance against the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 273-274, 279</ref>\n\n===Re-establishment of Yan's authority===\nShortly before losing Taiyuan Yan moved his headquarters to [[Linfen]], in southwestern Shanxi. Japanese forces halted their advance in order to focus on combating Communist guerrilla units still active in their territory and communicated to Yan that they would exterminate his forces within a year, but that he and his supporters would be treated with consideration if they severed relations with the central government and assisted the Japanese in suppressing the Communists. Yan responded by repeating his promise not to surrender until Japan had been defeated. Possibly because of the severity of his losses in northern Shanxi, Yan abandoned a plan of defense based on positional warfare, and began to reform his army as a force capable of waging guerrilla warfare. After 1938 most of Yan's followers came to refer to his regime as a \"guerrilla administration\".<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 273-275</ref>\n\nYan's intransigence obliged the Japanese to invade Linfen. His forces, under the command of [[Wei Lihuang]], put up a stiff defense at [[Lingshi]] Pass but were eventually forced to abandon the position when a Japanese column broke through a different pass and threatened Linfen from the east. Wei was successful in preventing the Japanese from seizing the strategic [[Zhongtiao Mountains|Zhongtiao mountain range]], but the loss of Linfen and Lingshi forced Yan to withdraw with what remained of his army across the [[Yellow River]], into neighboring Shaanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 275-276</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1938 the Japanese transferred many of their forces away from Shanxi, and Yan succeeded in re-establishing his authority, setting up a headquarters in the remote mountainous district of [[Qi County, Shanxi|Qixian]]. The Japanese made several raids into southern Shanxi, but withdrew after encountering heavy resistance. By 1938 Yan's tactics had evolved to resemble the guerrilla warfare practiced by Communist forces in other parts of Shanxi, and his defenses featured coordination with Communist forces and  regular divisions of the Nationalist army.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 277</ref>\n\nYan's alliance with the Communists eventually suffered, as tensions escalated between the KMT and CCP in other parts of China. Yan himself eventually came to fear the rapid power and influence that Communist forces operating in Shanxi quickly gained, and this fear caused Yan to become increasingly hostile to Communist agents and soldiers. These tensions eventually led to the breakdown of his good relations with the Communists in 1939, when he began another offensive against the Japanese and attempted to wipe out the units of his army most friendly with the Communists by having them do most of the fighting. These units eventually rebelled against Yan, receiving assistance from the Communists, while soldiers aligned with the central government aided him. He eventually succeeded in driving the Communists and their sympathizers from the territory that he controlled, but most of the rural territory of northwestern Shanxi passed into the control of the Eighth Route Army. Yan's forces continued to battle the Japanese throughout 1940 as part of an indecisive guerrilla campaign.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 278-279</ref>\n\n===Negotiations with the Japanese===\nIn 1940 Yan's friend, [[Ry\u016bkichi Tanaka]], became chief of staff of the [[First Army (Japan)|Japanese First Army]], which was stationed in Shanxi. After Yan's animosity with the Communists became apparent, Tanaka began negotiations with Yan in an effort to induce him to enter into an anti-Communist alliance with Japan. Yan agreed to send a high-level representative to meet with the Japanese, and obtained permission from the central government to negotiate with them for an agreement to remove all troops from Shanxi in exchange for Yan's cooperation. Perhaps because the Japanese were unwilling to meet these demands, Yan withdrew from negotiations in December 1940, when Tanaka's superiors recalled him to Japan. Two months later the Japanese repeated their charge that Yan was a \"dupe\" of the Communists.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 279-280</ref>\n\nIn May 1941 Tanaka returned to Shanxi and reopened negotiations with Yan, despite a general resistance from other Japanese military leaders in North China. Tanaka returned to Tokyo in August 1941, paving the way for talks between Yan and Gen. Yoshio Iwamatsu, then the commander of the Japanese First Army in Shanxi. In the summer of 1942 Yan told the Japanese that he would aid them in their fight against the Communists if the Japanese withdrew a large part of their forces from Shanxi and provided his army with food, weapons and CH$15 million of precious metals.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 280</ref>\n\nWhen Iwamatsu sent his chief of staff, Col. [[Tadashi Hanaya]], to Qixian for the purpose of delivering what Yan demanded, Yan called the Japanese concessions inadequate and refused to negotiate with them. This refusal is variously explained as Yan's resentment over the arrogance of the Japanese, his conviction that they would lose the war in the Pacific after he heard about the [[Battle of Midway]], and/or the result of a translation error that convinced him that the Japanese were using the negotiations as a ploy to ambush and attack him by surprise. Because they had allowed Yan to deceive them, Iwamatsu lost his command and Hanaya was reassigned to the Pacific.<ref>Gillin ''Warlords'' 280-281</ref>\n\nAfter 1943 the Japanese began to negotiate with Yan clandestinely through civilian representatives (notably his  friend Daisaku Komoto) in an effort to avoid being humiliated by him. Through Komoto's efforts Yan and the Japanese came to observe an informal cease-fire, though the terms of this agreement are unknown. By 1944 Yan's troops were actively battling the Communists, possibly with the cooperation and assistance of the Japanese. His relationship with Chiang also deteriorated by 1944, when Yan warned that the masses would turn to communism if Chiang's government did not improve considerably. An American reporter who visited Shanxi in 1944 observed that Yan \"was thought of not necessarily as a puppet but rather as a compromise between the extremes of the treason at Nanjing and national resistance at Chongqing\" by the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 281-282</ref>\n\n===Relationship with the Japanese after 1945===\nAfter the [[surrender of Japan]] and the end of the [[Second World War]], Yan Xishan was notable for his ability to recruit thousands of Japanese soldiers stationed in northwest Shanxi in 1945, including their commanding officers, into his army. He was known to have successfully used a variety of tactics to achieve these defections: flattery, face-saving gestures, appeals to idealism and genuine expressions of mutual interest. In cases where these were not completely successful, he sometimes resorted to \"bribes and women\". His tactics in both convincing the Japanese to stay and in preventing them from leaving were highly successful, as the efforts of the Japanese were instrumental in keeping the area surrounding Taiyuan free from Communist control for the four years before the Communists won the [[Chinese Civil War]].<ref name=\"Journal1\">Gillin and Etter 500</ref>\n\nYan was successful in keeping the presence of the Japanese from American and Nationalist observers. He was known for making shows of disarming Japanese, only to rearm them at night. In one instance he disarmed several units of Japanese, had a reporter take a picture of the stacked weapons to show that he was following orders, then gave the weapons back to the Japanese. He once officially labelled a detachment of Japanese troops as \"railway repair laborers\" in public records before sending them, fully armed, into areas without railway tracks but full of Communist insurgents.<ref name=\"Journal1\" />\n\nBy recruiting the Japanese into his service in the manner that he did, he retained both the extensive industrial complex around Taiyuan and virtually all of the managerial and technical personnel employed by the Japanese to run it. Yan was so successful in convincing surrendered Japanese to work for him that, as word spread to other areas of north China, Japanese soldiers from those areas began to converge on Taiyuan to serve his government and army. At its greatest strength the Japanese \"special forces\" under Yan totaled 15,000 troops, plus an officer corps that was distributed throughout Yan's army. These numbers were reduced to 10,000 after serious American efforts to repatriate the Japanese were partially successful. By 1949 casualties had reduced the number of Japanese soldiers under Yan's command to 3,000. The leader of the Japanese under Yan's command, [[Imamura Hosaku]], committed suicide on the day that Taiyuan fell to Communist forces.<ref>Gillin and Etter 506-508</ref>\n\n== Civil war ==\n[[File:Yan Xishan1947.jpg|thumb|190px|Yan Xishan in 1947]]\nAfter [[World War II|the Second World War]], Yan's forces (including thousands of former Japanese troops) held out against the Communists during the [[Chinese Civil War]] for four years. They held out until April 1949, after the Nationalist government had lost control of northern China, allowing the PLA to encircle and besiege his forces.  The area surrounding the provincial capital of Taiyuan was the longest to resist Communist control.\n\n===The Shangdang Campaign===\n{{Main article|Shangdang Campaign}}\nThe [[Shangdang Campaign]] was the first battle between Communist and KMT forces after World War II. It began as an attempt by Yan (authorized by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]) to re-assert control over southern Shanxi, where the [[People's Liberation Army]] was known to be especially active. At the same time Yan's former general, Fu Zuoyi, had captured several important cities in [[Inner Mongolia]]: [[Baotou]] and [[Hohhot]]. If both Yan and Fu had been successful, they would have cut off the Communist headquarters in [[Yan'an]] from their forces in [[Northeast China]]. The local commander, [[Liu Bocheng]] (later named one of China's \"[[Yuan Shuai#People's Republic of China|Ten Great Marshals]]), decided to direct his forces against Yan in order to prevent this from happening. Liu's political commissar was [[Deng Xiaoping]], who later became China's \"[[paramount leader]]\".<ref name=Lew2234>Lew 22-23</ref>\n\nThe initial skirmishes of the campaign were fought on August 19, 1945, when Yan dispatched 16,000 troops under [[Shi Zebo]] to capture the city of [[Changzhi]], in southeast Shanxi. On September 1 Liu arrived with 31,000 troops and encircled Changzhi. After initial engagements between Shi Zebo and Liu Bocheng's forces, Shi barricaded his forces inside the regional center of Chengzhi. Liu's army occupied the area surrounding Chengzhi, but was not able to take the city, leading to a stalemate.<ref name=Lew2234 />\n\nAfter it became clear that Liu's forces were in danger of being defeated, Yan sent 20,000 more troops, commanded by Peng Yubin, to reinforce Shi and break the siege. Liu responded by concentrating his forces against Peng, leaving only a screening force behind to carry out low-level suppression activities in Changzhi.<ref name=Lew2234 /> Most of the forces left behind in Changzhi were selected from a local 50,000-man irregular militia unit, which had been used by Liu mainly for logistical support.\n\nPeng was initially successful in defeating PLA detachments, but eventually his forces were led into an ambush. He was killed, and his army quickly surrendered en masse. When Shi realized that he had no hope of relief he attempted to break out and flee to Taiyuan on October 8, but was caught on open ground, ambushed and forced to surrender on October 10.<ref>Lew 23</ref> He was taken as a prisoner of war.\n\nAlthough both forces suffered the same amount of dead or wounded\u20144,000-5,000\u2014the Communists were able to capture 31,000 of Yan's troops, who surrendered once they fell into these ambushes. After surrendering, most of Yan's forces were subjected to organized persuasion or coercion and eventually joined the Communists.<ref>Lew 23-24</ref> Most of the PLA casualties in the campaign occurred when they attempted to confront Peng's reinforcements in an orthodox battle, allowing Yan's forces to successfully target Liu's troops with their superior arms. After these tactics failed, PLA forces were able to kill or capture both Shi's and Peng's forces by leading them each into a series of well-orchestrated ambushes.\n\nThe Shangdang Campaign ended with the Communists in firm control of southern Shanxi. Because the army fielded by Yan was much better supplied and armed, the victory allowed the local PLA to acquire far more arms than had previously been available to them (including, for the first time, field artillery). It is said that the PLA victory in the Shangdang campaign altered the course of the ongoing Chongqing peace negotiations, allowing [[Mao Zedong]] to act from a stronger negotiating position. Their victory in the Shangdang campaign boosted the long-term prestige of both Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping.<ref>Yang 454</ref> Following the campaign, Liu left a small force behind to defend southern Shanxi, leading most of his best units and captured equipment to confront the forces of [[Sun Lianzhong]] in the [[Handan Campaign|Pinghan Campaign]].<ref>Lew 24</ref>\n\nIn 1946 Communist forces in [[Northwest China]] identified the capture of Yan's capital of Taiyuan as one of their main objectives, and throughout 1946 and 1947 Yan was constantly involved in efforts to defend the north and retake the south.<ref>Lew 50-52</ref> These efforts were only temporarily successful, and by the winter of 1947 his control of Shanxi was restricted to the area of northern Shanxi adjacent to Taiyuan. Yan observed that the Communists were growing stronger and predicted that within six months they would rule half of China. After losing southern Shanxi Yan undertook preparations to defend Taiyuan to the death, perhaps in the hopes that if he and other anti-Communist leaders could hold out long enough the United States would eventually join the war on their side, saving his forces from destruction.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 286</ref>\n\n===The Taiyuan Campaign===\n{{Main article|Taiyuan Campaign}}\n[[File:Yan Xishan 1948.jpg|right|thumb|220px|During the siege of Taiyuan, Yan told foreign journalists that he and his followers would swallow cyanide pills before they let the PLA take Shanxi. Many of his followers committed suicide when Taiyuan fell.]]\nBy 1948 Yan's forces had suffered a succession of serious military defeats by the PLA, losing control of southern and central Shanxi, and were surrounded on all sides by territory controlled by the Communists. Anticipating an assault on northern Shanxi, Yan prepared his armies by fortifying over 5,000 bunkers, constructed over the rugged natural terrain surrounding Taiyuan. The Nationalist 30th Army was airlifted from Xian to Taiyuan to fortify the city, which was protected by over 600 pieces of artillery. Yan repeatedly declared his intentions to die in the city during this period. The total number of Nationalist troops present in northern Shanxi by the fall of 1948 was 145,000.\n\nTo overcome these defenses, the Communist commander [[Xu Xiangqian]] developed a strategy of engaging positions on the outskirts of Taiyuan before besieging the city itself. The first hostilities in the Taiyuan Campaign occurred on October 5, 1948. By November 13 the Communists succeeded in taking the area around the eastern side of Taiyuan. The Nationalists suffered serious setbacks when entire divisions defected or surrendered. In one case, a Nationalist division led by [[Dai Bingnan]] pretended to surrender, but then arrested the Communist officers who entered Dai's camp to accept. Yan Xishan mistakenly believed the leader of the arrested group, [[Jin Fu]], was the high-ranking Communist leader [[Hu Yaobang]] (who the Nationalists believed was active in the region). Yen airlifted the captured group to Chiang Kai-shek, who executed them after they failed to produce important information. Dai himself was rewarded with a large amount of gold for his actions, but was not allowed to be airlifted out of Taiyuan. After the city fell he was captured, tried in a well-propagandized show trial and publicly executed.\n\nBetween November 1948 and April 1949 a stalemate was reached and there was little advancement by either side.  Tactics used by the Communists during this time included [[psychological warfare]], such as forcing relatives of the Nationalist defenders to the front to ask for the defenders' surrender. These tactics were successful as, from December 1, 1948, through March 1949, over 12,000 Nationalist soldiers surrendered.\n\nAfter [[Pingjin Campaign|major PLA victories in Hebei in late January, 1949]], Communist armies in Shanxi were reinforced with additional troops and artillery. After this reinforcement, the total number of men under Liu's command exceeded 320,000, of which 220,000 were reserves. By the end of 1948 Yan Xishan had lost over 40,000 troops, but attempted to supplement this number through large-scale conscription.\n\nYan Xishan himself (along with most of the provincial treasury) was airlifted out of Taiyuan in March 1949 for the express purpose of asking the central government for more supplies. He left behind [[Sun Chu]] as the commander of his military police force, with Yan's son-in-law, [[Wang Jingguo]], in charge of most Nationalist forces. Overall command was delegated to [[Imamura Hosaku]], the Japanese lieutenant-general who had joined Yan after World War II.<ref name=\"Gillin Warlord 288\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 288</ref>\n\nShortly after Yan was airlifted out of Taiyuan, Nationalist planes stopped dropping food and supplies for the defenders due to fears of being shot down by the advancing Communists.<ref name=\"Gillin Warlord 288\"/> The Communists, depending largely on their reinforcements of artillery, launched a major assault on April 20, 1949, and succeeded in taking all positions surrounding Taiyuan by April 22. A subsequent appeal to the defenders to surrender was refused. On the morning of April 22, 1949, the PLA bombarded Taiyuan with 1,300 pieces of artillery and breached the city's walls, initiating bloody street-to-street fighting for control of the city. At 10:00 am, April 22, the Taiyuan Campaign ended with the Communists in complete control of Shanxi. Total Nationalist casualties amounted to all 145,000 defenders, many of whom were taken as POWs. The Communists lost 45,000 men and an unknown number of civilian laborers they had drafted, all of whom were either killed or injured.<ref name=\"Spence488\">Spence 488</ref>\n\nThe fall of Taiyuan was one of the few examples in the Chinese Civil War in which Nationalist forces echoed the defeated Ming loyalists who had, in the 17th century, brought entire cities to ruins resisting the invading Manchus. Many Nationalist officers were reported to have committed suicide when the city fell. The dead included Yan's nephew-in-law, who was serving as governor, and his cousin, who ran his household. [[Liang Huazhi]], the head of Yan's \"Patriotic Sacrifice League\", had fought for years against the Communists in Shanxi until he was finally trapped in the massively fortified city of Taiyuan. For six months Liang put up a fierce resistance, leading both Yan's remaining Chinese forces and his thousands of Japanese mercenaries. When Communist troops finally broke into the city and began to occupy large sections of it, Liang barricaded himself inside a large, fortified prison complex filled with Communist prisoners. In a final act of self-sacrifice, Liang set fire to the prison and committed suicide as the entire compound burned to the ground.<ref name=\"Spence488\"/>\n\n==Last Years==\n\n===Premier of the Republic of China===\nIn March 1949 Yan flew to the capital of Nanjing for the purpose of asking the central government for more food and ammunition, taking most of the provincial treasury with him, and did not return before Taiyuan fell to Communist forces. Shortly after arriving in Nanjing, Yan insinuated himself into a quarrel between the acting president of the Chinese Republic, [[Li Zongren]], and Chiang Kai-shek, who had resigned from the presidency in January 1949. Although Chiang had resigned, many officials and generals remained loyal to him, and Chiang retained over US$200 million, which he did not allow Li to use in order to fight the Communists or to stabilize the currency. The ongoing power struggle between Li and Chiang seriously disrupted the larger effort to defend Nationalist territory from Communist forces.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 288-289</ref>\n\nYan focused his efforts on attempting to promote greater cooperation between Li and Chiang. On one occasion he broke down in tears when attempting, at Chiang's request, to convince Li not to resign. He repeatedly used the example of the loss of Shanxi, and warned that the Nationalist cause was doomed unless Li and Chiang's relationship improved. Li eventually attempted to form a government, including both Chiang's supporters and critics, with Yan as premier. Despite Yan's efforts, Chiang refused to allow Li access to more than a fraction of the wealth that Chiang had sent to [[Taiwan]], and officers loyal to Chiang refused to follow Li's orders, frustrating efforts to coordinate Nationalist defenses and to stabilize the currency.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 289-290</ref>\n\nBy late 1949 the Nationalists' position had become desperate. The currency issued by the central government rapidly declined in value until it became virtually worthless. Military forces loyal to Li attempted to defend [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]], while those loyal to Chiang attempted to defend [[Sichuan]]. Both forces refused to cooperate with each other, eventually leading to the loss of both regions. Yan's constant attempts to work with both sides led to his being alienated from both Li and Chiang, who resented Yan for cooperating with either side. The Communists succeeded in taking all territory held on the mainland by the end of 1949, defeating both Li and Chiang. Li went into exile in the US, while Yan continued to serve as Premier, in Taiwan, until 1950, when Chiang re-assumed the presidency.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 290-291</ref>\n\n===Retirement in Taiwan===\n[[File:Yan Xishan 1950.jpg|thumb|Yan retired from public life in 1950. He spent much of his retirement writing, analyzing contemporary political issues and promoting Yan Xishan Thought.]]\n[[File:\u95bb\u932b\u5c71\u5893.jpg|thumb|Yan Xishan's tomb in [[Shilin District]], [[Taipei]].]]\n\nYan's final years were filled with disappointment and sadness. After following Chiang to Taiwan he enjoyed the title of Chiang's \"senior advisor\", but in reality he was utterly powerless. Chiang may have held a long-term grudge against Yan due to his activities on behalf of Li in Guangdong. On more than one occasion Yan requested permission to go to Japan, but was not allowed to leave Taiwan.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 291</ref>\n\nYan was deserted by all but a handful of followers, and spent most of his remaining years writing books on philosophy, history and contemporary events, which he frequently had translated into English.<ref name=\"Gillin291\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 291-292</ref> His late philosophical perspective has been described as \"anti-communist and anti-capitalist Confucian utopianism\". Several months before the [[Korean War]] Yan published a book, ''Peace or World War'', in which he predicted that [[North Korea]] would invade [[South Korea]], that South Korea would be quickly overcome, that the US would intervene on the side of South Korea, and that Communist China would intervene on the side of North Korea. All of these events later occurred over the course of the Korean War.<ref>Lawson</ref>\n\nYan died in Taiwan on May 24, 1960.<ref name=\"Gillin291\" /> He was buried in the Qixingjun region of [[Yangmingshan]]. For decades Yan's residence and grave were cared for by a small number of former aides, who had accompanied him from Shanxi. In 2011, when the last of his aides turned 81 and was unable to care for the residence, the responsibility of maintaining the site was taken over by the [[Taipei City Government]].<ref>Zhou</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter the civil war Yan, like most Nationalist generals who did not switch sides, was demonized by Communist propaganda.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 282</ref> It was not until after 1979, with new reforms in China, that he began to be viewed more positively (and thus, more realistically) as a pragmatic anti-Japanese hero. The contributions by Yan during his period in office are beginning to be recognized by the current Chinese government. One of his achievements\u2014his success in containing one of the epidemics in Shanxi\u2014was cited recently by various Chinese governmental organizations as an example to follow to contain the [[H5N1|bird flu]] and [[severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] epidemics in China, and was used to criticize the incompetence of Chinese governmental officials in handling such epidemics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nYan was sincere about his attempts to modernize Shanxi, and achieved success in some regards. By the time he was forced out of Shanxi by the Communists, the province was a major producer of coal, iron, chemicals, and munitions.<ref>Goodman 840</ref> Yan's generous support for the Research Association for the Improvement of Chinese Medicine generated a body of teaching and publication in modern Chinese medicine that became one of the foundations of the national institution of modern traditional Chinese medicine that was adopted in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Har61\"/> Throughout his rule he attempted to promote social reforms that later came to be taken for granted, but which were highly controversial in his time: the abolition of foot binding; work for women outside the home; universal primary education; and the existence of peasant militias as a fundamental unit of the army. He was possibly the warlord most committed to his province in his era, but was constantly challenged by his own dilettantism and the selfishness and incompetence of his own officials.<ref name=\"Bonavia138\">Bonavia 138-139</ref>\n\nAlthough Yan constantly spoke of the desirability and need for reforms, until the 1930s he remained too conservative to implement anything resembling the kind of reforms needed to successfully modernize Shanxi. Many of his attempts at reform in the 1920s had been attempted generations before, during the [[Tongzhi Restoration]]. These Qing Dynasty reformers had found their reforms inadequate solutions to the problems of their time, and under the Model Governor these reforms proved equally unsatisfactory. During the 1930s Yan became increasingly open to radical social and economic policies, including wealth redistribution via graduated taxation, state-led industrialization, opposition to the money economy, an orientation towards functional (vs. \"moral\") education and the large-scale assimilation of Western technology. Despite his adoption of Soviet-style economic policies and increasingly radical attempts at social reform, Yan was regarded as a \"conservative\" throughout his career, suggesting that the term \"conservative\" must be used carefully within the context of modern Chinese history.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 293-295</ref>\n\nAfter Yan's time Shanxi became the site of [[Mao Zedong]]'s \"model brigade\" of [[Dazhai, Xiyang County|Dazhai]]: a utopian communist scheme in [[Xiyang County]] that was supposed to be the model for all other peasants in China to emulate. If the people of Dazhai were especially suited for such an experiment, it is possible that decades of Yan's socialist indoctrination may have prepared the people of Shanxi for Communist rule. After the death of Mao, the experiment was discontinued, and most peasants reverted to private farming.<ref name=\"Bonavia138\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Yen_Hsi-shan.ogg|2007-04-11}}\n* [[Eighth Route Army]]\n* [[History of the Republic of China]]\n* [[List of warlords and military cliques in the Warlord Era|List of Warlords]]\n* [[National Revolutionary Army]]\n* [[Shang Zhen]]\n* [[Shanxi clique]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Andrews, Bridie.

He effectively controlled the province of [[Shanxi]] from the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] to the 1949 Communist victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. As the leader of a relatively small, poor, remote province, he survived the machinations of [[Yuan Shikai]], the [[Warlord Era]], the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Era]], the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] and the [[Chinese Civil War|subsequent civil war]], being forced from office only when the Nationalist armies with which he was aligned had completely lost control of the Chinese mainland, isolating Shanxi from any source of economic or military supply. He has been viewed by Western biographers as a transitional figure who advocated using Western technology to protect Chinese traditions, while at the same time reforming older political, social and economic conditions in a way that paved the way for the radical changes that would occur after his rule.<ref name=\"Portrait1\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 289</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nHe was born in the late [[Qing Dynasty]] in [[Wutai County]], [[Xinzhou]], Shanxi, to a family that had been bankers and merchants for generations (Shanxi was known for its many successful banks until the late 19th century). As a young man he worked for several years at his father's bank while pursuing a traditional Confucian education at a local village school. After his father was ruined by a late 19th-century depression that ravaged the Chinese economy, Yan enrolled in a free military school that was run and financed by the Manchu government in [[Taiyuan]]. While studying at this school he was first introduced to mathematics, physics and various other subjects imported directly from the West. In 1904 he was sent to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] to study at the [[Tokyo Shimbu Gakko]], a military preparatory academy, after which he entered the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]], from which he graduated in 1909.<ref name=\"Portrait2\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 290</ref>\n\n===Experience in Japan===\nOver the five years that Yan studied in Japan, he became impressed by the country's efforts to successfully modernize. He observed the progress made by the Japanese (whom the Chinese had previously considered unsophisticated and backward) and began to worry about the consequences if China were to fall behind the rest of the world. This formative experience was later cited as a period of great inspiration for his later efforts to modernize Shanxi.<ref name=\"Portrait2\" />\n\nYan eventually concluded that the Japanese had successfully modernized largely due to the government's abilities to mobilize its populace in support of its policies and to the close, respectful relationship that existed between the military and civilian populations. He attributed the surprising Japanese victory in the 1905 [[Russo-Japanese War]] to the enthusiastic mobilization of the Japanese public in support of the military. After returning to China in 1910 he wrote a pamphlet warning China that it was in danger of being overtaken by Japan unless it developed a local form of ''[[bushido]]''.<ref name=\"Portrait3\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 291</ref>\n\nEven before studying in Japan, Yan had become disgusted with the open and widespread corruption of Qing officials in Shanxi, and had become convinced that China's relative helplessness in the 19th century was the result of the dynasty's generally hostile attitude towards modernization and industrial development, and a grossly inept foreign policy. While he was in Japan he met [[Sun Yat-sen]] and joined his [[Tongmenghui]] (Revolutionary Alliance), a semi-secret society dedicated to overthrowing the Qing dynasty. He also attempted to popularize Sun's ideology by organizing an affiliated \"Blood and Iron Society\" within the ranks of Chinese students at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. The goal of this student group was to organize a revolution that would lead to the creation of a strong and united China, similar to how [[Otto von Bismarck]] had created a strong and united Germany.<ref name=\"Portrait3\" /> Yan also joined an even more militant organization of Chinese revolutionaries, the \"Dare-to-Die Corps\".<ref name=\"W399\">Wang 399</ref>\n\n===Return to China===\nWhen he returned to China in 1909 he was assigned as a division commander of the [[New Army]] in Shanxi,<ref name=\"Portrait4\" /> but secretly worked to overthrow the Qing.<ref name=\"W399\" /> During the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] Yan led local revolutionary forces in driving Manchu troops from the province, proclaiming it independent of the Qing government. He justified his actions by attacking the Qing's failure to repel [[Concessions in China|foreign aggression]], and promised a wide range of social and political reforms.<ref name=\"Portrait4\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 292</ref>\n\n==Career in the early Republic==\n[[File:Yan Xishan3.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Yan Xishan in the early 1920s, shortly after taking power in Shanxi.]]\n\n===Conflict with Yuan Shikai===\nIn 1911 Yan hoped to join forces with another prominent Shanxi revolutionary, Wu Luzhen, in order to undermine [[Yuan Shikai]]'s control of north China, but these plans were aborted after Wu was assassinated.<ref name=\"W399\" /> Yan was elected military governor by his comrades but was unable to prevent a subsequent invasion by the troops of Yuan Shikai, who occupied most parts of Shanxi in 1913. During the period of Yuan's invasion, Yan was only able to survive by withdrawing northward and aligning himself with a friendly insurgent group in neighboring [[Shaanxi]] province. By avoiding a decisive military confrontation with Yuan, Yan was able to preserve his own base of power. Though he was friends with Sun Yat-sen, Yan withheld support for him in the 1913 \"[[History of the Republic of China#Second Revolution|Second Revolution]]\", and instead ingratiated himself with Yuan, who allowed him to return as military governor of Shanxi, commanding a military that was then staffed by Yuan's own henchmen.<ref name=\"Portrait4\" /> In 1917, shortly after Yuan Shikai's death, Yan solidified his control over [[Shanxi]], ruling there uncontested.<ref name=\"Spence1\">Spence 406</ref>  After Yuan's death in 1916, China descended into a period of warlordism.\n\nThe determination of Shanxi to resist Manchu rule was a factor leading Yuan to believe that only the abolition of the Qing dynasty could bring peace to China and end the civil war. Yan's inability to resist Yuan's military domination of northern China was a factor contributing to Sun Yat-sen's decision not to personally pursue the presidency of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which was established after the end of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The demonstrated futility of opposing Yuan's military domination can only have made it seem more important to Sun to bring Yuan into the process of ruling the Republic, and to come to terms with his (potential) enemy.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 18</ref>\n\n===Efforts to modernize Shanxi===\nBy 1911, Shanxi was one of the poorest provinces in China. Yan believed that, unless he was able to modernize and revive Shanxi's economy and infrastructure, he would be unable to prevent Shanxi from being overrun by rival warlords.<ref>Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 302</ref>  A military defeat in 1919 inflicted by a rival warlord convinced Yan that Shanxi was not sufficiently developed to compete for hegemony with other warlords, and he avoided the violent national politics of the time by enforcing a neutrality policy on Shanxi, freeing his province from the [[warlord era|civil wars]]. Instead of participating in the ongoing civil wars, Yan devoted himself almost exclusively to modernizing Shanxi and developing its resources. The success of his reforms were sufficient for him to be dubbed by outsiders as the \"Model Governor\", with Shanxi the \"Model Province\".<ref name=\"Portrait4\" />\n\nIn 1918 there was an outbreak of bubonic plague in northern Shanxi that lasted for two months and killed 2,664 people. Yan dealt with this epidemic by issuing instructions on modern germ theory and plague management to his officials. Yan instructed people that the plague was caused by tiny germs that were breathed into the lungs, that the disease was incurable, and that the only way to keep the disease from spreading was physical isolation of the infected. He ordered his officials to keep infected family members, neighbors, or even entire infected communities from each other, by threat of police force if necessary. Yan's promotion of germ theory and his enforcement of physical isolation to reduce the effect of epidemics was not completely accepted by the local population, and in some areas the local people resisted these measures.<ref>Harrison 62</ref>\n\nYan's determination to modernize Shanxi was partly inspired by his interactions with the foreign doctors and personnel who arrived in Shanxi in 1918 in order to help him suppress the epidemic. He was impressed with the zeal, talents and modern outlook of these personnel, and subsequently compared foreigners favorably to his own conservative and generally apathetic officials. Conversations with other famous reformers, including [[John Dewey]], [[Hu Shih]] and Yan's close friend [[H.H. Kung]], reinforced his determination to Westernize Shanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 22</ref>\n\nYan attempted to modernize the state of medicine in China by funding the Research Society for the Advancement of Chinese Medicine, based in Taiyuan, in 1921. Highly unusual in China at the time, the school had a four-year curriculum and included courses in both Chinese and Western Medicine. Its courses were taught in English, German, and Japanese. The main skills that Yan hoped physicians trained at the school would learn were: a standardized system of diagnosis; sanitary science, including bacteriology; surgical skills, including obstetrics; and, the use of diagnostic instruments. Yan hoped that his support of the school would eventually lead to increased revenues in the domestic and international trade of Chinese drugs, improved public health, and improved public education. Yan's interest in having such a school active in Shanxi was sparked after staying in a Western hospital in Japan for three months, in which he was impressed by seeing modern medical equipment, including x-rays and microscopes, for the first time.<ref>Andrews 171-172</ref><ref name=\"Har61\">Harrison 61</ref>\n\nYan continued to promote a tradition of Chinese medicine that was informed by Western medical science throughout his period of governance, but much of the teaching and publication that this school of medicine produced was limited to the area around Taiyuan: by 1949 three of the seven government-run hospitals were in the city. In 1934 the province produced a ten-year-plan that envisaged employing a hygiene worker in every village, but the advent of WWII and the subsequent civil war made it impossible to carry these plans out.<ref>Harrison 63</ref>\n\n===Involvement in the Northern Expedition===\n{{Main article|Northern Expedition}}\n[[File:Yen's Soldiers, Militarism In China, Here Are Specimens Of The Soldiery Who Protect The People By Dominating Them, Who Protect Property By Looting It, Liao Chow, Shansi, China (c1925) IE Oberholtzer (probable) (RESTORED) (4072600660).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Yan Xishan's soldiers in Liaozhou (now [[Zuoquan County]]) in 1925 during the war with Henan warlord Fan Zhongxiu.]]\nIn order to maintain Shanxi's neutrality and free it from serious military confrontations with rival warlords, Yan developed a strategy of shifting alliances between various warring cliques, inevitably joining only winning sides. Although he was weaker than many of the warlords that surrounded him, he often held the balance of power between neighboring rivals, and even those that he betrayed hesitated to retaliate against him in case they might need his support in the future. In order to resist the domination of Manchurian warlord [[Zhang Zuolin]], Yan allied himself with the forces of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in 1927, during the Nationalists' [[Northern Expedition]]. While aiding Chiang, Yan's occupation of Beijing in June 1928 brought the Northern Expedition to a successful conclusion.<ref name=\"Portrait5\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 293</ref>  Yan's assistance to Chiang was rewarded shortly afterwards by his being named Minister of the Interior<ref>''TIME Magazine'' Dec. 24, 1928. p.293</ref> and deputy commander-in-chief of all Kuomintang armies<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 111</ref> Yan's support for Chiang's military campaigns and his [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|suppression of Communists]] influenced Chiang to recognize Yan as the governor of Shanxi, and to allow him to expand his influence into [[Hebei]].<ref name=\"W399\" />\n\n===Involvement in the Central Plains War===\n{{Main article|Central Plains War}}\n[[File:Yen Hsi-shan TIME Cover.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Yan Xishan--\"China's Next President\".]]\nYan's alliance with Chiang was interrupted in 1929 when Yan joined Chiang's enemies to establish an alternative national government in northern China. His allies included the northern warlord [[Feng Yuxiang]], the [[New Guangxi clique|Guangxi Clique]] led by [[Li Zongren]], and the left-leaning Kuomintang faction led by [[Wang Jingwei]]. While Feng and Chiang's armies were annihilating each other, Yan marched virtually unopposed through [[Shandong]], capturing the provincial capital of [[Jinan]] in June 1930. After these victories Yan attempted to forge a new national government, with himself as President, by calling an \"Enlarged Party Conference\". Under his plan Yan was to be president and Wang Jingwei was to serve as his prime minister. This conference attempted to draft a national constitution and involved the participation of numerous high-ranking Chinese militarists and politicians from among Chiang's rivals. These deliberations were interrupted by Chiang who, after decisively defeating Feng's armies, invaded Shandong and virtually annihilated Yan's army. When the governor of Manchuria, [[Zhang Xueliang]], publicly declared his allegiance to Chiang (whose support Zhang required in order to contest the Russians and Japanese), Yan fled to [[Dalian]] in the Japanese-held [[Kwantung Leased Territory]], only returning to an unconquered Shanxi after making peace with Chiang in 1931.<ref name=\"W399\" /><ref name=\"Portrait5\" /><ref>''TIME Magazine'' Sep. 29, 1930</ref>  During this \"[[Central Plains War]]\", the [[Kuomintang]] encouraged Muslims and Mongols to overthrow both [[Feng Yuxiang]] and Yan.<ref>Lin 22</ref>  Chiang's defeat of Yan and Feng in 1930 is considered the end of China's [[Warlord Era]].\n\nThe events between 1927-31 are best explained as the strategies of warlords accustomed to the constantly shifting, chaotic alliances that had characterized Chinese politics since the breakdown of the central government a decade earlier. The main cause of Yan's defeat was the low population and lack of development in the areas that he had under his control, making him incapable of fielding a large and well-equipped army similar to the ones commanded by Chiang at the time.<ref name=\"Portrait5\" /> Yan was also unable to match the quality of leadership in Chiang's officer corps and the prestige that Chiang and the Nationalist army possessed at the time.<ref name=\"Portrait6\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 294</ref> Before Chiang's armies defeated Feng and Yan, Yan Xishan appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]], with the subtitle \"China's Next President.\"<ref>''TIME Magazine''. May 19, 1930</ref>  The attention given to him by foreign observers in this period, and the support and assistance that he had secured from other high-profile Chinese statesmen, implies that there was a credible expectation that Yan would lead a central government if Chiang failed to defeat Yan's alliance.\n\n===Return to Shanxi===\nYan was only able to return to Shanxi through a complex effort of intrigue and politicking. Much of Chiang's failure to immediately and permanently eject Yan or his subordinates from Shanxi was due largely to the influence of Zhang Xueliang and the Japanese, who were anxious to prevent the extension of Chiang's authority into Manchuria. In Yan's absence the civil government of Shanxi ground to a halt, and the various military leaders of Shanxi struggled with each other to fill the vacuum, forcing Chiang's government to appoint Shanxi's leaders from among Yan's subordinates. Although he did not immediately declare his return to provincial politics, Yan returned to Shanxi in 1931 with the support and protection of Zhang. This move was not protested by Chiang due to his involvement in suppressing the forces of [[Li Zongren]], who had marched up to northern [[Hunan]] from his base in [[Guangxi]] in support of Yan.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 118-122</ref>\n\nYan remained in the background of Shanxi politics until the Nanjing government's failure to resist the Japanese takeover of Manchuria after the [[Mukden Incident]] gave Yan and his followers an opportunity to informally overthrow the Kuomintang in Shanxi. On December 18, 1931, a group of students (supported and perhaps orchestrated by officials loyal to Yan) gathered in Taiyuan to protest the Nanjing government's policy of not fighting the Japanese. This demonstration became so violent that Kuomintang police fired into the crowd. The public outrage that this \"Massacre of December Eighteenth\" generated was strong enough to give Yan's officials a pretext to expel the Kuomintang from the province on the grounds of public safety. After this event the Kuomintang ceased to exist in Shanxi except as a dummy organization whose members were more loyal to Yan than to Chiang Kai-shek.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 122-123</ref>\n\nFuture difficulties in securing the loyalty of other Chinese warlords across China, the ongoing civil war with the Communists and the ongoing threat of Japanese invasion motivated Chiang to let Yan retain the title of Pacification Commissioner in 1932, and he appointed Yan to the central government's [[Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission]]. In 1934 Chiang finally flew to Taiyuan, where he praised Yan's administration in return for Yan's public support for Nanjing. By publicly praising Yan's government, Chiang in effect admitted that Yan remained the undisputed ruler of Shanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 123-124</ref>\n\n===Subsequent relationship with the Nationalist government===\nAfter 1931, Yan continued to give nominal support to the Nanjing government while maintaining de facto control over Shanxi, alternatively cooperating with and fighting against Communist agents active in his province. Although he was not an active participant, Yan supported the 1936 [[Xi'an Incident]], in which Chiang Kai-shek was arrested by Nationalist officers led by [[Zhang Xueliang]] and [[Yang Hucheng]] and released only when he agreed to make peace with the Communists and form a [[Second United Front|\"united front\"]] to resist the impending Japanese invasion of China. In his correspondence with [[Zhang Xueliang]] in 1936 Yan indicated that the growing rift between him and Chiang was due to Yan's anxieties over the potential for a Japanese invasion and a concern for the subsequent fate of China, and because Yan was not convinced of the correctness of focusing China's resources on anti-Communist campaigns.<ref name=\"Spence1\" /> During the Xian Incident itself Yan actively involved himself in the negotiations, sending representatives to prevent Chiang's execution (and the civil war that Yan believed would follow) while pushing for a united front to resist the Japanese invasion of China that Yan believed was imminent.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 239-241</ref>\n\nThe financial relationship between Shanxi and the central government remained complicated. Yan was successful in creating a complex of heavy industries around Taiyuan, but neglected to publicize the extent of his success outside of Shanxi, probably to deceive Chiang Kai-shek. Despite his measured successes in modernizing the industry of Shanxi, Yan repeatedly petitioned the central government for financial assistance in order to extend the local railroad, and for other reasons, but his requests were usually denied. When Yan refused to send taxes collected from the trade of salt (produced in Shanxi's public factories) to the central government, Chiang retaliated by flooding the market of northern China with so much salt (produced around coastal China) that the price of salt in China's northern provinces dropped extremely low: due to these artificially low salt prices, neighboring provinces virtually stopped purchasing Shanxi salt altogether. In 1935 Chiang's announcement of a \"five-year plan\" to modernize Chinese industry was perhaps inspired by the successes of the \"Ten-Year Plan\" that Yan had announced several years before.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 193</ref>\n\n==Public policies==\nIn Shanxi, Yan implemented numerous successful reforms in an effort to centralize his control over the province.  Although embracing the traditional values of the landed gentry, he denounced their \"oppression\" of the peasantry and took steps to initiate [[land reform]] and weaken the power of landowners over the populace in the countryside. These reforms also weakened potential rivals in his province, in addition to benefiting Shanxi farmers.<ref name=\"Portrait1\" />\n\nYan attempted to develop his army as a locally recruited force which cultivated a public image of being servants, rather than masters, of the people. He developed an all-encompassing, idiosyncratic ideology (literally \"Yan Xishan Thought\") and disseminated it by sponsoring a network of village newspapers and traveling dramatic troupes. He coordinated dramatic public meetings in which participants confessed their own misdeeds and/or denounced those of others. He devised a system of [[public education]], producing a population of trained workers and farmers literate enough to be indoctrinated without difficulty. The early date by which Yan devised and implemented these reforms (during the Warlord Era) contradicts later claims that these reforms were modeled on Communist programs and not vice versa.<ref name=\"Portrait2\" />\n\n===Military policies===\nWhen Yan returned from Japan in 1909, he was a firm proponent of [[militarism]], and proposed a system of national conscription along German and Japanese lines. Germany's defeat in [[World War I]] and Yan's defeat in [[Henan]] in 1919 caused him to reassess the value of militarism as a way of life. He then decreased the size of the army until 1923 (in order to save money), until a rumor circulated that rival warlords were planning on invading Shanxi. Yan then introduced military reforms designed to train a rural militia of 100,000 men, along the lines of Japanese and American reserves.<ref name=\"Gillin Warlord 24\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 24</ref>\n\nYan attempted, via conscription, to create a civilian reserve that would become the foundation of society in Shanxi. His troops were perhaps the only army in the Warlord era drawn exclusively from the province in which they were stationed, and because he insisted that his soldiers perform work to improve Shanxi's infrastructure\u2014including road-maintenance and assisting farmers\u2014and because his discipline ensured that his soldiers actually paid for anything they took from civilians, the army in Shanxi enjoyed much more popular support than most of his rivals' armies in China.<ref name=\"Portrait6\" />\n\nYan's officer corps was drawn from Shanxi's gentry and given two years of education at government expense. Despite efforts to subject his officers to a rigorous, Japanese-style training regimen and to indoctrinate them in Yan Xishan Thought, his armies never proved to be especially well-trained or disciplined in battle. In general, Yan's military record is not considered positive\u2014he had more defeats than victories\u2014and it is unclear whether his  officer corps either understood or sympathized with his objectives, instead entering his service solely in the interests of achieving prestige and a higher standard of living. Yan built an arsenal in Taiyuan that, for the entire period of his administration, remained the only center in China capable of producing field artillery. The presence of this arsenal was one of the main reasons that Yan was able to maintain Shanxi's relative independence.<ref name=\"Portrait6\" /> While not particularly effective fighting rival warlords, Yan's army was successful in eradicating banditry in Shanxi, allowing him to maintain a relatively high level of public order and security.<ref name=\"Portrait7\">Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 295</ref>  Yan's successes in eradicating banditry in Shanxi include his cooperation with Yuan Shikai to defeat Bai Lang's remnant rebels after the failed 1913-14 [[Bai Lang Rebellion]].\n\n===Attempts at social reform===\nYan went to great lengths to eradicate social traditions which he considered antiquated. He insisted that all men in Shanxi abandon their Qing-era queues, giving police instructions to clip off the queues of anyone still wearing them. In one instance, Yan lured people into theatres in order to have his police systematically cut the hair of the audience.<ref name=\"Portrait7\" /> He attempted to combat widespread female illiteracy by creating in each district at least one vocational school in which peasant girls could be given a primary-school education and taught domestic skills. After Kuomintang military victories in 1925 generated great interest in Shanxi for the Nationalist ideology, including [[women's rights]], Yan allowed girls to enroll in middle school and college, where they promptly formed a women's association.<ref name=\"Gillin Warlord 24\"/>\n\nYan attempted to eradicate the custom of [[foot binding]], threatening to sentence men who married women with bound feet, and mothers who bound their daughters' feet, to hard labor in state-run factories. He discouraged the use of the traditional [[lunar calendar]] and encouraged the development of local [[boy scout organizations]]. Like the Communists who later succeeded Yan, he punished habitual lawbreakers to \"redemption through labour\" in state-run factories.<ref name=\"Portrait7\" />\n\n===Attempts to eradicate opium use===\nIn 1916, at least 10% of Shanxi's 11 million people were addicted to [[opium]], and Yan attempted to eradicate opium use in Shanxi after he came to power. At first, he dealt with opium dealers and addicts severely, throwing addicts in prison and exposing them and their families to public humiliation. Many convicted of opium-related offenses then died of sudden withdrawal from the drug. After 1922, partly due to public opposition to harsh punishment, Yan abandoned punishing addicts in favor of attempting to rehabilitate them, pressuring individuals through their families, and constructing sanitariums designed to slowly cure addicts of their addictions.<ref name=\"Warlord1\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 38-40</ref>\n\nYan's attempts to suppress the opium trade in Shanxi were largely successful, and the number of opium addicts in the province was reduced by 80% by 1922. In the absence of efforts by other warlords to combat opium production and trade, Yan's efforts to combat opium use only increased the price of opium so much that narcotics of all kinds were drawn into Shanxi from other provinces. Users often switched from opium to pills mixed from [[morphine]] and [[heroin]], which were easier to smuggle and use. Because the most influential and powerful gentry in Shanxi were often the worst offenders, officials drawn from the privileged class of Shanxi seldom enforced Yan's decrees outlawing the use of narcotics, and often evaded punishment themselves. Eventually Yan was forced to abandon his efforts to suppress opium trafficking, and attempted instead to establish a [[government monopoly]] on the production and sale of opium in Shanxi.<ref name=\"Warlord1\" /> Yan continued to complain about the availability of narcotics into the 1930s, and after 1932 executed over 600 people caught smuggling drugs into Shanxi. The traffic persisted, but Yan's interests in opposing it were perhaps limited by a fear of provoking the Japanese, who manufactured most of the morphine and heroin available in China inside their [[Concessions in China|concession area]] in [[Tianjin]], and who came to control much of the drug trade in northern China in the 1930s.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 138</ref>\n\n===Limitations of economic reforms===\nYan's efforts to stimulate Shanxi's economy mostly consisted of state-led investment in a broad variety of industries, and he generally failed to encourage private investment and trade. Though gains were made to improve the economy of Shanxi, his efforts were limited by the fact that he himself had little formal training in economic or industrial theory. He also suffered from a lack of experienced, trained advisers capable of directing even moderately complicated tasks related to economic development. Because most of the educated staff that he did have access to were solidly entrenched within the landed gentry of Shanxi, it is possible that many of his officials may have deliberately sabotaged his efforts for reform, preferring that the peasants working their fields continue their cheap, traditional labour.<ref>Gillin ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 305</ref>\n\n==Yan Xishan Thought==\nThroughout his life Yan Xishan attempted to identify, formulate and disseminate a comprehensive ideology that would improve the morale and loyalty of his officials and the people of Shanxi. During his time of study in Japan, Yan became attracted to [[militarism]] and [[Social Darwinism]], but he renounced these after World War I. Throughout the rest of Yan's life he identified with the position of most Chinese conservatives at the time: that social and economic reform would progress from ethical reform, and that the problems confronting China could only be solved by the moral rehabilitation of the Chinese people.<ref name =Warlord59>Gillin ''Warlord'' 59</ref>  Believing that no single ideology existed to unify the Chinese people at the time that he came to power, Yan attempted to generate an ideal ideology himself, and once boasted that he had succeeded in creating a comprehensive system of belief that embodied the best features of \"militarism, nationalism, anarchism, democracy, capitalism, communism, individualism, imperialism, universalism, paternalism and utopianism\".<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 63</ref>  Much of Yan's attempts to spread his ideology were through a network of semi-religious organizations known as \"Heart-Washing Societies\".\n\n===Influence of Confucianism===\nYan was emotionally attached to [[Confucianism]] by virtue of his upbringing, and because he identified its values as a historically effective solution to the chaos and disorder of his time. He justified his rule via Confucian political theories and attempted to revive Confucian virtues as being universally accepted. In his speeches and writing Yan developed an extravagant admiration for the virtues of moderation and harmony associated with the Confucian [[Doctrine of the Mean]]. Many of the reforms that Yan attempted were undertaken with the intention of demonstrating that he was a ''junzi'', the epitome of Confucian virtue.<ref name=\"Warlord59\" />\n\nYan's interpretations of Confucianism were mostly borrowed from the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]] that was popular in the Qing dynasty. He taught that everyone had a capacity for innate goodness, but that in order to fulfill this capacity people had to subordinate their emotions and desires to the control of their conscience. He admired the [[Ming dynasty]] philosophers [[Lu Jiuyuan]] and [[Wang Yangming]], who disparaged knowledge and urged men to act on the basis of their intuition. Because Yan believed that human beings could only achieve their potentials through intense self-criticism and self-cultivation, he established in every town a Heart-Washing Society, whose members gathered each Sunday to meditate and listen to sermons based on the themes of the Confucian classics. Everyone at these meetings was supposed to rise and confess aloud his misdeeds of the past week, inviting criticism from the other members.<ref name =\"Warlord60\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 60</ref>\n\n===Influence of Christianity===\nYan attributed much of the West's vitality to Christianity, and believed that China could only resist and overtake the West by generating an ideological tradition that was equally inspiring. He appreciated the efforts of missionaries (mostly Americans who maintained a complex of schools in [[Taigu County|Taigu]]) to educate and modernize Shanxi. He regularly addressed the graduating classes of these schools, but was generally unsuccessful in recruiting these students to serve his regime. Yan supported the indigenous Christian church in Taiyuan, and at one time seriously considered using Christian chaplains in his army. His public support of Christianity waned after 1925, when he failed to come to the defense of Christians during anti-foreigner and anti-Christian demonstrations that polarized Taiyuan.<ref name =\"Warlord61\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 61-62</ref>\n\nYan deliberately organized many features of his Heart-Washing Society on the Christian church, including ending each service with hymns praising Confucius. He urged his subjects to place their faith in a supreme being that he called \"''Shangdi''\": he justified his belief in ''Shangdi'' via the Confucian classics, but described ''Shangdi'' in terms very similar to the Christian interpretation of God. Like Christianity, Yan Xishan Thought was permeated with the belief that, through accepting his ideology, people could become regenerated or reborn.<ref name =\"Warlord61\" />\n\n===Influence of Chinese Nationalism===\nIn 1911, Yan came to power in Shanxi as a disciple of Chinese nationalism, but subsequently came to view nationalism as merely another set of ideas that could be used to achieve his own objectives. He stated that the primary goal of the Heart-Washing Society was to encourage Chinese patriotism by reviving the Confucian church, leading foreigners to accuse him of attempting to create a Chinese version of [[Shinto]].<ref name =\"Warlord63\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 63-64</ref>\n\nYan attempted to moderate some aspects of [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ideology that he viewed as potentially threatening to his rule. Yan altered some of Sun's doctrines before disseminating them in Shanxi, formulating his own version of Sun's [[Three Principles of the People]] that replaced the principles of nationalism and democracy with the principles of virtue and knowledge. During the 1919 [[May Fourth Movement]], when students in Taiyuan staged anti-foreign demonstrations, Yan warned that patriotism, like rainfall, was beneficial only when moderate.<ref name =\"Warlord63\" />\n\nAfter the [[Kuomintang]] succeeded in forming a nominal central government in 1930, Yan encouraged Nationalist principles that he viewed as socially beneficial. During the 1930s he attempted to set up in every village a \"Good People's Movement\" in order to promote the values of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[New Life Movement]]. These values included honesty, friendliness, dignity, diligence, modesty, thrift, personal neatness and obedience.<ref name =\"Warlord60\" />.\n\n===Influence of socialism and communism===\nIn 1931 Yan returned from his exile in Dalian impressed with the apparent successes of Soviet Union's [[first five-year plan]], and attempted to reorganize the economy of Shanxi using Soviet methods, according to a local \"Ten-Year Plan\" that Yan himself developed.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 129</ref> Throughout the 1930s Yan bluntly equated economic development with state control of industry and finance, and he was successful in bringing most major industry and commerce under state control by the late 1930s.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 134</ref>\n\nYan's speeches after 1931 reflect an interpretation of [[Marxist economics]] (mostly drawn from ''[[Das Kapital]]'') that he gained while in exile in Dalian. Following this interpretation, Yan attempted to change the economy of Shanxi to become more like that of the [[USSR]], inspiring a scheme of economic \"distribution according to labour\". When the threat of Chinese Communists became a significant threat to Yan's rule, he defended the Communists as courageous and self-sacrificing fanatics who were different from common bandits (contrary to Kuomintang propaganda) and whose challenge must be met by social and economic reforms that alleviated the conditions responsible for communism.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 163-164</ref>\n\nLike [[Karl Marx|Marx]], Yan wanted to eliminate what he saw as unearned profit by restructuring Shanxi's economy to reward only those who worked. Unlike Marx, Yan reinterpreted Communism to correct what he believed was [[Marxism]]'s chief flaw: the inevitability of [[Class conflict|class warfare]]. Yan praised Marx for his analysis of the material aspects of human society, but professed to believe that there was a moral and spiritual unity of mankind that implied that a state of harmony was closer to the human ideal than conflict. By rejecting [[economic determinism]] in favor of morality and free will, Yan hoped to create a society that would be more productive and less violent than he perceived communism to be, while avoiding the exploitation and human misery that he believed was the inevitable result of capitalism.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 164</ref>\n\nYan interpreted [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt's]] [[New Deal]] as promoting socialism in order to combat the spread of communism. \"The New Deal is an effective way of stopping communism,\" Yan said, \"by having the government step in and ride roughshod over the interests of the rich.\" Yan then undertook a series of public works projects inspired by the New Deal in order to reduce unemployment in his own province.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 166-167.</ref>\n\n===Extent of success===\nIn spite of his efforts, Yan did not succeed in making Yan Xishan Thought widely popular in Shanxi, and most of his subjects refused to believe that his true objectives differed substantially from those of past regimes. Yan himself blamed the failure of his ideology to become popular on the faults of his officials, charging that they abused their power and failed to explain his ideas to the common people. In general, the officials of Shanxi misappropriated funds intended to be used for propaganda, attempted to explain Yan's ideas in language too sophisticated for the common people and often behaved in a dictatorial manner that discredited Yan's ideology and failed to generate popular enthusiasm for his regime.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 65-66</ref>\n\n==Threats to Yan's rule==\n\n===Early conflict with Japan===\nYan did not come into serious conflict with the Japanese until the early 1930s. While he was in exile in Dalian in 1930, Yan became aware of [[Mukden Incident|Japanese plans to invade Manchuria]], and feigned collaboration with the Japanese in order to pressure Chiang Kai-shek into allowing him to return to Shanxi before warning Chiang of Japan's intent. Japan's subsequent success in taking Manchuria in 1931 terrified Yan, who stated that a major objective of his Ten-Year Plan was to strengthen Shanxi's defense against the Japanese. In the early 1930s he supported anti-Japanese riots, denounced the Japanese occupation of Manchuria as \"barbarous\" and \"evil\", publicly appealed to Chiang to send troops to Manchuria and arranged for his arsenal to arm partisans fighting the Japanese occupation in Manchuria.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 211</ref>\n\nIn December 1931 Yan was warned that, after taking control of Manchuria, the Japanese would attempt to take control of [[Inner Mongolia]] by subverting Chinese authority in [[Chahar Province|Chahar]] and [[Suiyuan]]. In order to prevent this, he took control of Suiyuan first, developing its large iron deposits (24% of all iron in China), and settling the province with thousands of soldier-farmers. When the [[Manchukuo Imperial Army]] (armed and led by the Japanese) finally invaded Chahar in 1935, Yan virtually declared war on the Japanese by accepting a position as \"advisor\" of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council, an organization created by the central government to organize  opposition to the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 212-214</ref>\n\nThe Japanese began promoting \"autonomy\" for northern China in the summer of 1935. Apparently, many high-ranking Japanese in China believed that Yan and many others in the north were fundamentally pro-Japanese and would readily subordinate themselves to the Japanese in exchange for protection from Chiang Kai-shek. Yan published an [[open letter]] in September in which he accused the Japanese of desiring to conquer all of China over the next two decades. According to Japanese sources, Yan entered into negotiations with the Japanese in 1935, but was never very enthusiastic about \"autonomy\" and rejected their overtures when he realized that they intended to make him their puppet. Yan likely used these negotiations to frighten Chiang Kai-shek into using his armies to defend Shanxi, since he was afraid that Chiang was preparing to sacrifice northern China to avoid fighting the Japanese. If these were Yan's intentions they were successful, as Chiang assured Yan that he would defend Shanxi with his army in the event that it was invaded.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 216-218</ref>\n\n===Early conflict with the Chinese Communist Party===\nAlthough Yan admired its philosophy and economic methods, he feared the threat posed by Chinese communists almost as much as the Japanese. In the early 1930s he observed that, if it invaded Shanxi, the [[People's Liberation Army|Red Army]] would enjoy the support of 70% of his subjects, and would readily be able to recruit one million men from among the most desperate citizens of Shanxi. He remarked that \"the job of suppressing communism is 70% political and only 30% military, while the job of preventing its growth altogether is 90%  political.\" In order to prevent a Communist threat to Shanxi, Yan sent troops to fight the Communists in [[Jiangxi\u2013Fujian Soviet|Jiangxi]] and (later) [[Shaanxi]], organized the gentry and village authorities into anti-corruption and anti-communist political organizations and attempted (mostly unsuccessfully) to undertake a large-scale program of land reform.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 218-220</ref>\n\nThese reforms did not prevent the spread of Communist guerrilla operations into Shanxi. Led by [[Liu Zhidan]] and [[Xu Haidong]], 34,000 Communist troops crossed into southwestern Shanxi in February 1936. As Yan predicted, the Communists enjoyed massive popular support and, although they were outnumbered and ill-armed, succeeded in occupying the southern third of Shanxi in less than a month. The Communists' strategy of [[guerrilla warfare]] was extremely effective against, and demoralizing for, Yan's forces, who repeatedly fell victim to surprise attacks. The Communists in Shanxi made good use of cooperation supplied by local peasants to evade and easily locate Yan's forces. When reinforcements sent by the central government forced the Communists to withdraw from Shanxi, the Red Army escaped by splitting into small groups that were actively supplied and hidden by local supporters. Yan himself admitted that his troops had fought poorly during the campaign. The KMT forces that remained in Shanxi expressed hostility to Yan's rule, but did not interfere with his governance.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 220-221</ref>\n\n===Invasion by Mengguguo===\nIn March 1936, [[Manchukuo]] troops occupying the [[Inner Mongolia]]n province of [[Chahar Province|Chahar]] invaded northeastern [[Suiyuan]], which Yan controlled. These Japanese-aligned forces seized the city of [[Bailingmiao]] in northern Suiyuan, where the pro-Japanese [[Inner Mongolian Autonomous Political Council]] maintained its headquarters. Three months later the head of the Political Council, [[Demchugdongrub|Prince De (Demchugdongrub)]], declared that he was the ruler of an independent Mongolia ([[Mengjiang|Mengguguo]]), and organized an army with the aid of Japanese equipment and training. In August 1936 Prince De's army attempted to invade eastern Suiyuan, but it was defeated by Yan's forces under the command of [[Fu Zuoyi]]. Following this defeat, Prince De planned another invasion while Japanese agents carefully sketched and photographed Suiyuan's defenses.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 230</ref>\n\nTo prepare for the imminent threat of Japanese invasion that he felt after Suiyuan was invaded, Yan attempted to force all students to undergo several months of compulsive military training and formed an informal alliance with the Communists for the purpose of fighting the Japanese, several months before the [[Xi'an Incident]] compelled Chiang Kai-shek to do the same. In November 1936 the army of Prince De presented Fu Zuoyi with an ultimatum to surrender. When Fu responded that Prince De was merely a puppet of \"certain quarters\" and requested that he submit to the authority of the central government, Prince De's Mongolian and Manchurian armies launched another, more ambitious attack. Prince De's 15,000 soldiers were armed with Japanese weapons, supported by Japanese aircraft and often led by Japanese officers (Japanese soldiers fighting for Mengguguo were often executed after their capture as illegal combatants, since Mengguguo was not recognized as being part of Japan).<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 230-234</ref>\n\nIn anticipation of this war, Japanese spies destroyed a large supply depot in [[Datong]] and carried out other acts of sabotage. Yan placed his best troops and most able generals, including [[Zhao Chengshou]] and Yan's son-in-law, [[Wang Jingguo]], under the command of Fu Zuoyi. During the month of fighting that ensued, the army of Mengguguo suffered severe casualties. Fu's forces succeeded in retaking Bailingmiao on November 24 and he was considering invading Chahar before he was warned by the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] that doing so would provoke an attack by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Prince De's forces repeatedly attempted to retake Bailingmiao, but this only provoked Fu into sending troops north, where he successfully seized the last of Prince De's bases in Suiyuan and virtually annihilated his army. After Japanese officers were found to be aiding Prince De, Yan publicly accused Japan of aiding the invaders. His victories in Suiyuan over Japanese-backed forces were praised by Chinese newspapers and magazines, other warlords and political leaders, and many students and members of the Chinese public.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 234-236</ref>\n\n==The Second Sino-Japanese War==\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u201345), most regions of Shanxi were quickly overrun by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], but Yan refused to flee the province even after losing the provincial capital, Taiyuan. He relocated his headquarters to a remote corner of the province, effectively resisting Japanese attempts to completely seize Shanxi. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese made no less than five attempts to negotiate peace terms with Yan and hoped that he would become a second [[Wang Jingwei]], but Yan refused and stayed on the Chinese side.\n\n===Alliance with the Communists===\nAfter the failed attempt by the [[Chinese Red Army]] to establish bases in southern Shanxi in early 1936, the subsequent continued presence of Nationalist soldiers there and the Japanese attempts to take Suiyuan that summer, Yan became convinced that the Communists were lesser threats to his rule than either the Nationalists or the Japanese. He then negotiated a secret anti-Japanese \"united front\" with the Communists in October 1936 and, after the [[Xi'an Incident]] two months later, successfully influenced Chiang Kai-shek to enter into a similar agreement with the Communists. After establishing his alliance with the Communists Yan lifted the ban on Communist activities in Shanxi.<ref>Feng and Goodman 156-157</ref> He allowed Communist agents working under [[Zhou Enlai]] to establish a secret headquarters in Taiyuan,<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 263</ref> and released Communists that he had been holding in prison (including at least one general, Wang Ruofei).<ref>Wortzel 33</ref>\n\nYan, under the slogan \"resistance against the enemy and defense of the soil\", attempted to recruit young, patriotic intellectuals to his government in order to organize a local resistance to the threat of Japanese invasion. By 1936 Taiyuan had become a gathering point for anti-Japanese intellectuals who had fled from [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]] and [[northeast China]] who readily cooperated with Yan, but he also recruited natives of Shanxi who were living across China regardless of their former political associations. Some Shanxi officials attracted to Yan's cause in the late 1930s later became important figures in the Chinese government, including [[Bo Yibo]].<ref>Feng and Goodman 157-158</ref>\n\n===Early campaigns===\nIn July 1937, after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] provoked the Japanese into attacking Chinese forces in and around Beijing, the Japanese sent a large number of warplanes and Manchurian soldiers to reinforce Prince De's army. This caused Yan to believe that a Japanese invasion of Shanxi was imminent, and he flew to Nanjing to communicate the situation to Chiang Kai-shek. Yan left his meeting in Nanjing with an appointment as commander of the Second War Zone, comprising Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar and northern Shaanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 257</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Shanxi, Yan encouraged his officials to be suspicious of enemy spies and ''[[hanjian]]'', and ordered his forces to attack Prince De's forces in northern Chahar, hoping to surprise and overwhelm them quickly. The Mongolian and Manchu forces were quickly routed, and Japanese reinforcements attempting to force their way through the strategic Nankou pass suffered heavy casualties. Overwhelming Japanese firepower\u2014including artillery, bombers and tanks\u2014eventually forced Yan's forces to surrender Nankou, after which Japanese forces quickly seized Suiyuan and Datong. The Japanese then began the invasion of Shanxi in earnest.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 257-259</ref>\n\nAs the Japanese advanced southward into Taiyuan Basin, Yan attempted to impose discipline on his army by executing Gen. [[Li Fuying]] and other officers guilty of retreating from the enemy. He issued orders not to withdraw or surrender under any circumstances, vowed to resist Japan until the Japanese had been defeated and invited his own soldiers to kill him if he betrayed his promise. In the face of continued Japanese advances Yan apologized to the central government for his army's defeats, asked it to assume responsibility for the defense of Shanxi and agreed to share control of the provincial government with one of Chiang Kai-shek's representatives.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 262-263</ref>\n\nWhen it became clear to Yan that his forces might not be successful in repelling the Japanese army, he invited Communist military forces to re-enter Shanxi. [[Zhu De]] became the commander of the [[Eighth Route Army]] active in Shanxi and was named the vice-commander of the Second War Zone, under Yan himself. Yan initially responded warmly to the re-entry of the arrival of Communist forces, and they were greeted with enthusiasm by Yan's officials and officers. Communist forces arrived in Shanxi just in time to help defeat a decisively more powerful Japanese force attempting to move through the strategic mountain pass of [[Battle of Pingxingguan|Pingxingguan]]. After the Japanese responded to this defeat by outflanking the defenders and moving towards Taiyuan, the Communists avoided decisive battles and mostly attempted to harass Japanese forces and sabotage Japanese lines of supply and communication. The Japanese suffered, but mostly ignored the Eighth Route Army and continued to advance towards Yan's capital. The lack of attention directed at their forces gave the Communists time to recruit and propagandize among the local peasant populations (who generally welcomed Communist forces enthusiastically) and to organize a network of militia units, local guerrilla bands and popular mass organizations.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 263-264</ref>\n\nGenuine Communist efforts to resist the Japanese gave them the authority to carry out sweeping and radical social and economic reforms, mostly related to land and wealth redistribution, which they defended by labeling those who resisted as ''[[hanjian]]''. Communist efforts to resist the Japanese also won over Shanxi's small population of patriotic intellectuals, and conservative fears of resisting them effectively gave the Communists unlimited access to the rural population. Subsequent atrocities committed by the Japanese in the effort to rid Shanxi of Communist guerrillas aroused the hatred of millions in the Shanxi countryside, causing the rural population to turn to the Communists for leadership against the Japanese. All of these factors explain how, within a year of re-entering Shanxi, the Communists were able to take control of most of Shanxi not firmly held by the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 271</ref>\n\n===Fall of Taiyuan===\n[[File:Chinese troops marching in Xinkou.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Chinese troops marching to defend the mountain pass at Xinkou.]]\nBy executing commanders guilty of retreating, Yan succeeded in improving the morale of his forces. During the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] Yan's troops in Shanxi successfully resisted numerous Japanese assaults, while the Eighth Route Army harassed the Japanese from the rear and along their flanks. Other units of Yan's army successfully defended other nearby passes. After the Japanese successfully broke into the Taiyan Basin, they continued to encounter ferocious resistance. At [[Yuanping, Shanxi|Yuanping]], a single brigade of Yan's troops held out against the Japanese advance for over a week, allowing reinforcements sent by the central government to take up defensive positions at [[Battle of Xinkou|Xinkou]]. The Communist generals Zhu De and [[Peng Dehuai]] criticized Yan for what they called \"suicidal tactics\", but Yan was confident that the heavy losses suffered by the Japanese would eventually demoralize them, forcing them to abandon their effort to take Shanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 271-272</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Xinkou]], the Chinese defenders resisted the efforts of Japan's elite [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki|Itakagi Division]] for over a month, despite Japanese advantages in artillery and air support. By the end of October 1937, Japan's losses were four times greater than those suffered at Pingxingguan, and the Itakagi Division was close to defeat. Contemporary Communist accounts called the battle \"the most fierce in North China\", while Japanese accounts called the battle a \"stalemate\". In an effort to save their forces at Xinkou, Japanese forces began an effort to occupy Shanxi from a second direction, in the east. After a week of fighting, Japanese forces captured the strategic [[Niangzi Pass]], opening the way to capturing Taiyuan. Communist guerrilla tactics were ineffective in slowing down the Japanese advance. The defenders at Xinkou, realizing that they were in danger of being outflanked, withdrew southward, past Taiyuan, leaving a small force of 6,000 men to hold off the entire Japanese army.. A representative of the Japanese Army, speaking of [[Battle of Taiyuan|the final defense of Taiyuan]], said that \"nowhere in China have the Chinese fought so obstinately\".<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 272-273</ref>\n\nThe Japanese suffered 30,000 dead and an equal number wounded in their effort to take northern Shanxi. A Japanese study found that the battles of Pingxingguan, Xinkou, and Taiyuan were responsible for over half of all the casualties suffered by the Japanese army in North China. Yan himself was forced to withdraw after having 90% of his army destroyed, including a large force of reinforcements sent into Shanxi by the central government. Throughout 1937, numerous high-ranking Communist leaders, including [[Mao Zedong]], lavished praise on Yan for waging an uncompromising campaign of resistance against the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 273-274, 279</ref>\n\n===Re-establishment of Yan's authority===\nShortly before losing Taiyuan Yan moved his headquarters to [[Linfen]], in southwestern Shanxi. Japanese forces halted their advance in order to focus on combating Communist guerrilla units still active in their territory and communicated to Yan that they would exterminate his forces within a year, but that he and his supporters would be treated with consideration if they severed relations with the central government and assisted the Japanese in suppressing the Communists. Yan responded by repeating his promise not to surrender until Japan had been defeated. Possibly because of the severity of his losses in northern Shanxi, Yan abandoned a plan of defense based on positional warfare, and began to reform his army as a force capable of waging guerrilla warfare. After 1938 most of Yan's followers came to refer to his regime as a \"guerrilla administration\".<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 273-275</ref>\n\nYan's intransigence obliged the Japanese to invade Linfen. His forces, under the command of [[Wei Lihuang]], put up a stiff defense at [[Lingshi]] Pass but were eventually forced to abandon the position when a Japanese column broke through a different pass and threatened Linfen from the east. Wei was successful in preventing the Japanese from seizing the strategic [[Zhongtiao Mountains|Zhongtiao mountain range]], but the loss of Linfen and Lingshi forced Yan to withdraw with what remained of his army across the [[Yellow River]], into neighboring Shaanxi.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 275-276</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1938 the Japanese transferred many of their forces away from Shanxi, and Yan succeeded in re-establishing his authority, setting up a headquarters in the remote mountainous district of [[Qi County, Shanxi|Qixian]]. The Japanese made several raids into southern Shanxi, but withdrew after encountering heavy resistance. By 1938 Yan's tactics had evolved to resemble the guerrilla warfare practiced by Communist forces in other parts of Shanxi, and his defenses featured coordination with Communist forces and  regular divisions of the Nationalist army.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 277</ref>\n\nYan's alliance with the Communists eventually suffered, as tensions escalated between the KMT and CCP in other parts of China. Yan himself eventually came to fear the rapid power and influence that Communist forces operating in Shanxi quickly gained, and this fear caused Yan to become increasingly hostile to Communist agents and soldiers. These tensions eventually led to the breakdown of his good relations with the Communists in 1939, when he began another offensive against the Japanese and attempted to wipe out the units of his army most friendly with the Communists by having them do most of the fighting. These units eventually rebelled against Yan, receiving assistance from the Communists, while soldiers aligned with the central government aided him. He eventually succeeded in driving the Communists and their sympathizers from the territory that he controlled, but most of the rural territory of northwestern Shanxi passed into the control of the Eighth Route Army. Yan's forces continued to battle the Japanese throughout 1940 as part of an indecisive guerrilla campaign.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 278-279</ref>\n\n===Negotiations with the Japanese===\nIn 1940 Yan's friend, [[Ry\u016bkichi Tanaka]], became chief of staff of the [[First Army (Japan)|Japanese First Army]], which was stationed in Shanxi. After Yan's animosity with the Communists became apparent, Tanaka began negotiations with Yan in an effort to induce him to enter into an anti-Communist alliance with Japan. Yan agreed to send a high-level representative to meet with the Japanese, and obtained permission from the central government to negotiate with them for an agreement to remove all troops from Shanxi in exchange for Yan's cooperation. Perhaps because the Japanese were unwilling to meet these demands, Yan withdrew from negotiations in December 1940, when Tanaka's superiors recalled him to Japan. Two months later the Japanese repeated their charge that Yan was a \"dupe\" of the Communists.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 279-280</ref>\n\nIn May 1941 Tanaka returned to Shanxi and reopened negotiations with Yan, despite a general resistance from other Japanese military leaders in North China. Tanaka returned to Tokyo in August 1941, paving the way for talks between Yan and Gen. Yoshio Iwamatsu, then the commander of the Japanese First Army in Shanxi. In the summer of 1942 Yan told the Japanese that he would aid them in their fight against the Communists if the Japanese withdrew a large part of their forces from Shanxi and provided his army with food, weapons and CH$15 million of precious metals.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 280</ref>\n\nWhen Iwamatsu sent his chief of staff, Col. [[Tadashi Hanaya]], to Qixian for the purpose of delivering what Yan demanded, Yan called the Japanese concessions inadequate and refused to negotiate with them. This refusal is variously explained as Yan's resentment over the arrogance of the Japanese, his conviction that they would lose the war in the Pacific after he heard about the [[Battle of Midway]], and/or the result of a translation error that convinced him that the Japanese were using the negotiations as a ploy to ambush and attack him by surprise. Because they had allowed Yan to deceive them, Iwamatsu lost his command and Hanaya was reassigned to the Pacific.<ref>Gillin ''Warlords'' 280-281</ref>\n\nAfter 1943 the Japanese began to negotiate with Yan clandestinely through civilian representatives (notably his  friend Daisaku Komoto) in an effort to avoid being humiliated by him. Through Komoto's efforts Yan and the Japanese came to observe an informal cease-fire, though the terms of this agreement are unknown. By 1944 Yan's troops were actively battling the Communists, possibly with the cooperation and assistance of the Japanese. His relationship with Chiang also deteriorated by 1944, when Yan warned that the masses would turn to communism if Chiang's government did not improve considerably. An American reporter who visited Shanxi in 1944 observed that Yan \"was thought of not necessarily as a puppet but rather as a compromise between the extremes of the treason at Nanjing and national resistance at Chongqing\" by the Japanese.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 281-282</ref>\n\n===Relationship with the Japanese after 1945===\nAfter the [[surrender of Japan]] and the end of the [[Second World War]], Yan Xishan was notable for his ability to recruit thousands of Japanese soldiers stationed in northwest Shanxi in 1945, including their commanding officers, into his army. He was known to have successfully used a variety of tactics to achieve these defections: flattery, face-saving gestures, appeals to idealism and genuine expressions of mutual interest. In cases where these were not completely successful, he sometimes resorted to \"bribes and women\". His tactics in both convincing the Japanese to stay and in preventing them from leaving were highly successful, as the efforts of the Japanese were instrumental in keeping the area surrounding Taiyuan free from Communist control for the four years before the Communists won the [[Chinese Civil War]].<ref name=\"Journal1\">Gillin and Etter 500</ref>\n\nYan was successful in keeping the presence of the Japanese from American and Nationalist observers. He was known for making shows of disarming Japanese, only to rearm them at night. In one instance he disarmed several units of Japanese, had a reporter take a picture of the stacked weapons to show that he was following orders, then gave the weapons back to the Japanese. He once officially labelled a detachment of Japanese troops as \"railway repair laborers\" in public records before sending them, fully armed, into areas without railway tracks but full of Communist insurgents.<ref name=\"Journal1\" />\n\nBy recruiting the Japanese into his service in the manner that he did, he retained both the extensive industrial complex around Taiyuan and virtually all of the managerial and technical personnel employed by the Japanese to run it. Yan was so successful in convincing surrendered Japanese to work for him that, as word spread to other areas of north China, Japanese soldiers from those areas began to converge on Taiyuan to serve his government and army. At its greatest strength the Japanese \"special forces\" under Yan totaled 15,000 troops, plus an officer corps that was distributed throughout Yan's army. These numbers were reduced to 10,000 after serious American efforts to repatriate the Japanese were partially successful. By 1949 casualties had reduced the number of Japanese soldiers under Yan's command to 3,000. The leader of the Japanese under Yan's command, [[Imamura Hosaku]], committed suicide on the day that Taiyuan fell to Communist forces.<ref>Gillin and Etter 506-508</ref>\n\n== Civil war ==\n[[File:Yan Xishan1947.jpg|thumb|190px|Yan Xishan in 1947]]\nAfter [[World War II|the Second World War]], Yan's forces (including thousands of former Japanese troops) held out against the Communists during the [[Chinese Civil War]] for four years. They held out until April 1949, after the Nationalist government had lost control of northern China, allowing the PLA to encircle and besiege his forces.  The area surrounding the provincial capital of Taiyuan was the longest to resist Communist control.\n\n===The Shangdang Campaign===\n{{Main article|Shangdang Campaign}}\nThe [[Shangdang Campaign]] was the first battle between Communist and KMT forces after World War II. It began as an attempt by Yan (authorized by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]) to re-assert control over southern Shanxi, where the [[People's Liberation Army]] was known to be especially active. At the same time Yan's former general, Fu Zuoyi, had captured several important cities in [[Inner Mongolia]]: [[Baotou]] and [[Hohhot]]. If both Yan and Fu had been successful, they would have cut off the Communist headquarters in [[Yan'an]] from their forces in [[Northeast China]]. The local commander, [[Liu Bocheng]] (later named one of China's \"[[Yuan Shuai#People's Republic of China|Ten Great Marshals]]), decided to direct his forces against Yan in order to prevent this from happening. Liu's political commissar was [[Deng Xiaoping]], who later became China's \"[[paramount leader]]\".<ref name=Lew2234>Lew 22-23</ref>\n\nThe initial skirmishes of the campaign were fought on August 19, 1945, when Yan dispatched 16,000 troops under [[Shi Zebo]] to capture the city of [[Changzhi]], in southeast Shanxi. On September 1 Liu arrived with 31,000 troops and encircled Changzhi. After initial engagements between Shi Zebo and Liu Bocheng's forces, Shi barricaded his forces inside the regional center of Chengzhi. Liu's army occupied the area surrounding Chengzhi, but was not able to take the city, leading to a stalemate.<ref name=Lew2234 />\n\nAfter it became clear that Liu's forces were in danger of being defeated, Yan sent 20,000 more troops, commanded by Peng Yubin, to reinforce Shi and break the siege. Liu responded by concentrating his forces against Peng, leaving only a screening force behind to carry out low-level suppression activities in Changzhi.<ref name=Lew2234 /> Most of the forces left behind in Changzhi were selected from a local 50,000-man irregular militia unit, which had been used by Liu mainly for logistical support.\n\nPeng was initially successful in defeating PLA detachments, but eventually his forces were led into an ambush. He was killed, and his army quickly surrendered en masse. When Shi realized that he had no hope of relief he attempted to break out and flee to Taiyuan on October 8, but was caught on open ground, ambushed and forced to surrender on October 10.<ref>Lew 23</ref> He was taken as a prisoner of war.\n\nAlthough both forces suffered the same amount of dead or wounded\u20144,000-5,000\u2014the Communists were able to capture 31,000 of Yan's troops, who surrendered once they fell into these ambushes. After surrendering, most of Yan's forces were subjected to organized persuasion or coercion and eventually joined the Communists.<ref>Lew 23-24</ref> Most of the PLA casualties in the campaign occurred when they attempted to confront Peng's reinforcements in an orthodox battle, allowing Yan's forces to successfully target Liu's troops with their superior arms. After these tactics failed, PLA forces were able to kill or capture both Shi's and Peng's forces by leading them each into a series of well-orchestrated ambushes.\n\nThe Shangdang Campaign ended with the Communists in firm control of southern Shanxi. Because the army fielded by Yan was much better supplied and armed, the victory allowed the local PLA to acquire far more arms than had previously been available to them (including, for the first time, field artillery). It is said that the PLA victory in the Shangdang campaign altered the course of the ongoing Chongqing peace negotiations, allowing [[Mao Zedong]] to act from a stronger negotiating position. Their victory in the Shangdang campaign boosted the long-term prestige of both Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping.<ref>Yang 454</ref> Following the campaign, Liu left a small force behind to defend southern Shanxi, leading most of his best units and captured equipment to confront the forces of [[Sun Lianzhong]] in the [[Handan Campaign|Pinghan Campaign]].<ref>Lew 24</ref>\n\nIn 1946 Communist forces in [[Northwest China]] identified the capture of Yan's capital of Taiyuan as one of their main objectives, and throughout 1946 and 1947 Yan was constantly involved in efforts to defend the north and retake the south.<ref>Lew 50-52</ref> These efforts were only temporarily successful, and by the winter of 1947 his control of Shanxi was restricted to the area of northern Shanxi adjacent to Taiyuan. Yan observed that the Communists were growing stronger and predicted that within six months they would rule half of China. After losing southern Shanxi Yan undertook preparations to defend Taiyuan to the death, perhaps in the hopes that if he and other anti-Communist leaders could hold out long enough the United States would eventually join the war on their side, saving his forces from destruction.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 286</ref>\n\n===The Taiyuan Campaign===\n{{Main article|Taiyuan Campaign}}\n[[File:Yan Xishan 1948.jpg|right|thumb|220px|During the siege of Taiyuan, Yan told foreign journalists that he and his followers would swallow cyanide pills before they let the PLA take Shanxi. Many of his followers committed suicide when Taiyuan fell.]]\nBy 1948 Yan's forces had suffered a succession of serious military defeats by the PLA, losing control of southern and central Shanxi, and were surrounded on all sides by territory controlled by the Communists. Anticipating an assault on northern Shanxi, Yan prepared his armies by fortifying over 5,000 bunkers, constructed over the rugged natural terrain surrounding Taiyuan. The Nationalist 30th Army was airlifted from Xian to Taiyuan to fortify the city, which was protected by over 600 pieces of artillery. Yan repeatedly declared his intentions to die in the city during this period. The total number of Nationalist troops present in northern Shanxi by the fall of 1948 was 145,000.\n\nTo overcome these defenses, the Communist commander [[Xu Xiangqian]] developed a strategy of engaging positions on the outskirts of Taiyuan before besieging the city itself. The first hostilities in the Taiyuan Campaign occurred on October 5, 1948. By November 13 the Communists succeeded in taking the area around the eastern side of Taiyuan. The Nationalists suffered serious setbacks when entire divisions defected or surrendered. In one case, a Nationalist division led by [[Dai Bingnan]] pretended to surrender, but then arrested the Communist officers who entered Dai's camp to accept. Yan Xishan mistakenly believed the leader of the arrested group, [[Jin Fu]], was the high-ranking Communist leader [[Hu Yaobang]] (who the Nationalists believed was active in the region). Yen airlifted the captured group to Chiang Kai-shek, who executed them after they failed to produce important information. Dai himself was rewarded with a large amount of gold for his actions, but was not allowed to be airlifted out of Taiyuan. After the city fell he was captured, tried in a well-propagandized show trial and publicly executed.\n\nBetween November 1948 and April 1949 a stalemate was reached and there was little advancement by either side.  Tactics used by the Communists during this time included [[psychological warfare]], such as forcing relatives of the Nationalist defenders to the front to ask for the defenders' surrender. These tactics were successful as, from December 1, 1948, through March 1949, over 12,000 Nationalist soldiers surrendered.\n\nAfter [[Pingjin Campaign|major PLA victories in Hebei in late January, 1949]], Communist armies in Shanxi were reinforced with additional troops and artillery. After this reinforcement, the total number of men under Liu's command exceeded 320,000, of which 220,000 were reserves. By the end of 1948 Yan Xishan had lost over 40,000 troops, but attempted to supplement this number through large-scale conscription.\n\nYan Xishan himself (along with most of the provincial treasury) was airlifted out of Taiyuan in March 1949 for the express purpose of asking the central government for more supplies. He left behind [[Sun Chu]] as the commander of his military police force, with Yan's son-in-law, [[Wang Jingguo]], in charge of most Nationalist forces. Overall command was delegated to [[Imamura Hosaku]], the Japanese lieutenant-general who had joined Yan after World War II.<ref name=\"Gillin Warlord 288\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 288</ref>\n\nShortly after Yan was airlifted out of Taiyuan, Nationalist planes stopped dropping food and supplies for the defenders due to fears of being shot down by the advancing Communists.<ref name=\"Gillin Warlord 288\"/> The Communists, depending largely on their reinforcements of artillery, launched a major assault on April 20, 1949, and succeeded in taking all positions surrounding Taiyuan by April 22. A subsequent appeal to the defenders to surrender was refused. On the morning of April 22, 1949, the PLA bombarded Taiyuan with 1,300 pieces of artillery and breached the city's walls, initiating bloody street-to-street fighting for control of the city. At 10:00 am, April 22, the Taiyuan Campaign ended with the Communists in complete control of Shanxi. Total Nationalist casualties amounted to all 145,000 defenders, many of whom were taken as POWs. The Communists lost 45,000 men and an unknown number of civilian laborers they had drafted, all of whom were either killed or injured.<ref name=\"Spence488\">Spence 488</ref>\n\nThe fall of Taiyuan was one of the few examples in the Chinese Civil War in which Nationalist forces echoed the defeated Ming loyalists who had, in the 17th century, brought entire cities to ruins resisting the invading Manchus. Many Nationalist officers were reported to have committed suicide when the city fell. The dead included Yan's nephew-in-law, who was serving as governor, and his cousin, who ran his household. [[Liang Huazhi]], the head of Yan's \"Patriotic Sacrifice League\", had fought for years against the Communists in Shanxi until he was finally trapped in the massively fortified city of Taiyuan. For six months Liang put up a fierce resistance, leading both Yan's remaining Chinese forces and his thousands of Japanese mercenaries. When Communist troops finally broke into the city and began to occupy large sections of it, Liang barricaded himself inside a large, fortified prison complex filled with Communist prisoners. In a final act of self-sacrifice, Liang set fire to the prison and committed suicide as the entire compound burned to the ground.<ref name=\"Spence488\"/>\n\n==Last Years==\n\n===Premier of the Republic of China===\nIn March 1949 Yan flew to the capital of Nanjing for the purpose of asking the central government for more food and ammunition, taking most of the provincial treasury with him, and did not return before Taiyuan fell to Communist forces. Shortly after arriving in Nanjing, Yan insinuated himself into a quarrel between the acting president of the Chinese Republic, [[Li Zongren]], and Chiang Kai-shek, who had resigned from the presidency in January 1949. Although Chiang had resigned, many officials and generals remained loyal to him, and Chiang retained over US$200 million, which he did not allow Li to use in order to fight the Communists or to stabilize the currency. The ongoing power struggle between Li and Chiang seriously disrupted the larger effort to defend Nationalist territory from Communist forces.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 288-289</ref>\n\nYan focused his efforts on attempting to promote greater cooperation between Li and Chiang. On one occasion he broke down in tears when attempting, at Chiang's request, to convince Li not to resign. He repeatedly used the example of the loss of Shanxi, and warned that the Nationalist cause was doomed unless Li and Chiang's relationship improved. Li eventually attempted to form a government, including both Chiang's supporters and critics, with Yan as premier. Despite Yan's efforts, Chiang refused to allow Li access to more than a fraction of the wealth that Chiang had sent to [[Taiwan]], and officers loyal to Chiang refused to follow Li's orders, frustrating efforts to coordinate Nationalist defenses and to stabilize the currency.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 289-290</ref>\n\nBy late 1949 the Nationalists' position had become desperate. The currency issued by the central government rapidly declined in value until it became virtually worthless. Military forces loyal to Li attempted to defend [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]], while those loyal to Chiang attempted to defend [[Sichuan]]. Both forces refused to cooperate with each other, eventually leading to the loss of both regions. Yan's constant attempts to work with both sides led to his being alienated from both Li and Chiang, who resented Yan for cooperating with either side. The Communists succeeded in taking all territory held on the mainland by the end of 1949, defeating both Li and Chiang. Li went into exile in the US, while Yan continued to serve as Premier, in Taiwan, until 1950, when Chiang re-assumed the presidency.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 290-291</ref>\n\n===Retirement in Taiwan===\n[[File:Yan Xishan 1950.jpg|thumb|Yan retired from public life in 1950. He spent much of his retirement writing, analyzing contemporary political issues and promoting Yan Xishan Thought.]]\n[[File:\u95bb\u932b\u5c71\u5893.jpg|thumb|Yan Xishan's tomb in [[Shilin District]], [[Taipei]].]]\n\nYan's final years were filled with disappointment and sadness. After following Chiang to Taiwan he enjoyed the title of Chiang's \"senior advisor\", but in reality he was utterly powerless. Chiang may have held a long-term grudge against Yan due to his activities on behalf of Li in Guangdong. On more than one occasion Yan requested permission to go to Japan, but was not allowed to leave Taiwan.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 291</ref>\n\nYan was deserted by all but a handful of followers, and spent most of his remaining years writing books on philosophy, history and contemporary events, which he frequently had translated into English.<ref name=\"Gillin291\">Gillin ''Warlord'' 291-292</ref> His late philosophical perspective has been described as \"anti-communist and anti-capitalist Confucian utopianism\". Several months before the [[Korean War]] Yan published a book, ''Peace or World War'', in which he predicted that [[North Korea]] would invade [[South Korea]], that South Korea would be quickly overcome, that the US would intervene on the side of South Korea, and that Communist China would intervene on the side of North Korea. All of these events later occurred over the course of the Korean War.<ref>Lawson</ref>\n\nYan died in Taiwan on May 24, 1960.<ref name=\"Gillin291\" /> He was buried in the Qixingjun region of [[Yangmingshan]]. For decades Yan's residence and grave were cared for by a small number of former aides, who had accompanied him from Shanxi. In 2011, when the last of his aides turned 81 and was unable to care for the residence, the responsibility of maintaining the site was taken over by the [[Taipei City Government]].<ref>Zhou</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter the civil war Yan, like most Nationalist generals who did not switch sides, was demonized by Communist propaganda.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 282</ref> It was not until after 1979, with new reforms in China, that he began to be viewed more positively (and thus, more realistically) as a pragmatic anti-Japanese hero. The contributions by Yan during his period in office are beginning to be recognized by the current Chinese government. One of his achievements\u2014his success in containing one of the epidemics in Shanxi\u2014was cited recently by various Chinese governmental organizations as an example to follow to contain the [[H5N1|bird flu]] and [[severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] epidemics in China, and was used to criticize the incompetence of Chinese governmental officials in handling such epidemics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nYan was sincere about his attempts to modernize Shanxi, and achieved success in some regards. By the time he was forced out of Shanxi by the Communists, the province was a major producer of coal, iron, chemicals, and munitions.<ref>Goodman 840</ref> Yan's generous support for the Research Association for the Improvement of Chinese Medicine generated a body of teaching and publication in modern Chinese medicine that became one of the foundations of the national institution of modern traditional Chinese medicine that was adopted in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Har61\"/> Throughout his rule he attempted to promote social reforms that later came to be taken for granted, but which were highly controversial in his time: the abolition of foot binding; work for women outside the home; universal primary education; and the existence of peasant militias as a fundamental unit of the army. He was possibly the warlord most committed to his province in his era, but was constantly challenged by his own dilettantism and the selfishness and incompetence of his own officials.<ref name=\"Bonavia138\">Bonavia 138-139</ref>\n\nAlthough Yan constantly spoke of the desirability and need for reforms, until the 1930s he remained too conservative to implement anything resembling the kind of reforms needed to successfully modernize Shanxi. Many of his attempts at reform in the 1920s had been attempted generations before, during the [[Tongzhi Restoration]]. These Qing Dynasty reformers had found their reforms inadequate solutions to the problems of their time, and under the Model Governor these reforms proved equally unsatisfactory. During the 1930s Yan became increasingly open to radical social and economic policies, including wealth redistribution via graduated taxation, state-led industrialization, opposition to the money economy, an orientation towards functional (vs. \"moral\") education and the large-scale assimilation of Western technology. Despite his adoption of Soviet-style economic policies and increasingly radical attempts at social reform, Yan was regarded as a \"conservative\" throughout his career, suggesting that the term \"conservative\" must be used carefully within the context of modern Chinese history.<ref>Gillin ''Warlord'' 293-295</ref>\n\nAfter Yan's time Shanxi became the site of [[Mao Zedong]]'s \"model brigade\" of [[Dazhai, Xiyang County|Dazhai]]: a utopian communist scheme in [[Xiyang County]] that was supposed to be the model for all other peasants in China to emulate. If the people of Dazhai were especially suited for such an experiment, it is possible that decades of Yan's socialist indoctrination may have prepared the people of Shanxi for Communist rule. After the death of Mao, the experiment was discontinued, and most peasants reverted to private farming.<ref name=\"Bonavia138\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Yen_Hsi-shan.ogg|2007-04-11}}\n* [[Eighth Route Army]]\n* [[History of the Republic of China]]\n* [[List of warlords and military cliques in the Warlord Era|List of Warlords]]\n* [[National Revolutionary Army]]\n* [[Shang Zhen]]\n* [[Shanxi clique]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Andrews, Bridie.

To all licensees, Arm provides an integratable hardware description of the ARM core, as well as complete software development toolset and the right to sell manufactured [[silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\n===Silicon customization===\nIntegrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) receive the ARM Processor [[Intellectual property|IP]] as [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] (written in [[Verilog]]). In this form, they have the ability to perform architectural level optimizations and extensions. This allows the manufacturer to achieve custom design goals, such as higher clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions (including floating point), optimizations for size, debug support, etc.  To determine which components have been included in a particular Arm CPU chip, consult the manufacturer datasheet and related documentation.\n\nSome of the silicon options for the Cortex-M cores are:\n* SysTick timer: A 24-bit system timer that extends the functionality of both the processor and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). When present, it also provides an additional configurable priority SysTick interrupt.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/> Though the SysTick timer is optional, it is very rare to find a Cortex-M microcontroller without it.  If a Cortex-M33 microcontroller has the Security Extension option, then it has two SysTicks, one Secure and one Non-secure.\n* Bit-Band: Maps a complete word of memory onto a single bit in the bit-band region. For example, writing to an alias word will set or clear the corresponding bit in the bit-band region. This allows every individual bit in the bit-band region to be directly accessible from a word-aligned address. In particular, individual bits can be set, cleared, or toggled from C/C++ without performing a read-modify-write sequence of instructions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>  Though the bit-band is optional, it is less common to find a Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 microcontroller without it.  Some Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers have bit-band. \n* Memory Protection Unit (MPU): Provides support for protecting regions of memory through enforcing privilege and access rules. It supports up to eight different regions, each of which can be split into a further eight equal-size sub-regions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>\n* Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM): Low-latency RAM that is used to hold critical routines, data, stacks.  Other than cache, it is typically the fastest RAM in the microcontroller.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <big>ARM Cortex-M optional components</big>\n|-\n! ARM Core !!

Legacy cores allowed \"on-the-fly\" changing of the data [[endianness|endian]] mode.\n* [[Coprocessor|Co-processor]] were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n\nThe capabilities of the 32-bit ARM instruction set is duplicated in many ways by the Thumb-1 and Thumb-2 instruction sets, but some ARM features don't have a similar feature:\n* The SWP and SWPB (swap) ARM instructions don't have a similar feature in Cortex-M.\n\nThe 16-bit Thumb-1 instruction set has evolved over time since it was first released in the legacy [[ARM7|ARM7T]] cores with the ARMv4T architecture.  New Thumb-1 instructions were added as each legacy ARMv5 / ARMv6 / ARMv6T2 architectures were released. Some 16-bit Thumb-1 instructions were removed from the Cortex-M cores:\n* The \"BLX <immediate>\" instruction doesn't exist because it was used to switch from Thumb-1 to ARM instruction set.  The \"BLX <register>\" instruction is still available in the Cortex-M.\n* SETEND doesn't exist because on-the-fly switching of data endian mode is no longer supported.\n* Co-processor instructions were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n* The SWI instruction was renamed to SVC, though the instruction binary coding is the same. However, the SVC handler code is different from the SWI handler code, because of changes to the exception models.\n\n==Cortex-M0==\n{{Infobox CPU\n|name = Cortex-M0\n|arch = [[ARM architecture#Thumb|Thumb-1]] (most),<br/>[[ARM architecture#Thumb-2|Thumb-2]] (some)\n|microarch = ARMv6-M\n}}\n\nThe Cortex-M0 core is optimized for small silicon die size and use in the lowest price chips.\n\nKey features of the Cortex-M0 core are:<ref name=\"M0-TRM\">[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0432c/DDI0432C_cortex_m0_r0p0_trm.pdf Cortex-M0 r0p0 Technical Reference Manual; Arm Holdings.]</ref>\n* ARMv6-M architecture<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/>\n* 3-stage [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]\n* Instruction sets:\n** Thumb-1 (most), missing CBZ, CBNZ, IT\n** Thumb-2 (some), only BL, DMB, DSB, ISB, MRS, MSR\n** 32-bit hardware integer multiply with 32-bit result\n* 1 to 32 [[interrupt]]s, plus [[non-maskable interrupt|NMI]]\n\n'''Silicon options:'''\n* Hardware integer multiply speed: 1 or 32 cycles.\n\n===Chips===\nThe following microcontrollers are based on the Cortex-M0 core:\n* ABOV Semiconductor AC30M1x64\n* [[Cypress Semiconductor|Cypress]] PSoC 4000, 4100, 4100M, 4200, 4200DS, 4200L, 4200M \n* [[Infineon Technologies|Infineon]] [[Infineon XMC|XMC1100]], XMC1200, XMC1300, XMC1400, TLE984x\n*[[Dialog Semiconductor]] DA1458x, DA1468x\n* [[Nordic Semiconductor|Nordic]] [[nRF51]]\n* [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] [[LPC1100]], [[LPC1200]]\n* [[Nuvoton|nuvoTon]] NuMicro M0 Family\n* Sonix SN32F700\n* [[STMicroelectronics|ST]] [[STM32#STM32 F0|STM32 F0]]\n* [[Toshiba]] TX00\n* Vorago VA10800 (extreme temperature), VA10820 (radiation hardened)\n\nThe following chips have a Cortex-M0 as a secondary core:\n* [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] [[LPC4300]] (one Cortex-M4F + one Cortex-M0)\n* [[Texas Instruments]] SimpleLink Wireless MCUs CC1310 and CC2650 (one programmable Cortex-M3 + one Cortex-M0 network processor + one proprietary Sensor Controller Engine)\n\n==Cortex-M0+==\n{{Infobox CPU\n|name = Cortex-M0+\n|arch = [[ARM architecture#Thumb|Thumb-1 (most)]],<br/>[[ARM architecture#Thumb-2|Thumb-2 (some)]]\n|microarch = ARMv6-M\n}}\n[[File:Freescale FRDM-KL25Z board with KL25Z128VLK (ARM Cortex-M0+ MCU).JPG|thumb|right| [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] ([[Freescale]]) FRDM-KL25Z Board with KL25Z128VLK (Kinetis L)]]\nThe Cortex-M0+ is an optimized superset of the Cortex-M0.

In the past, 8-bit microcontroller documentation would typically fit in a single document, but as microcontrollers have evolved, so has everything required to support them.  A documentation package for ARM chips typically consists of a collection of documents from the IC manufacturer as well as the CPU core vendor ([[Arm Holdings]]).\n\nA typical top-down documentation tree is:\n\n;Documentation tree (top to bottom)\n# IC manufacturer website.\n# IC manufacturer marketing slides.\n# IC manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip.\n# IC manufacturer reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family.\n# ARM core website.\n# ARM core generic user guide.\n# ARM core technical reference manual.\n# ARM architecture reference manual.\n\nIC manufacturers have additional documents, such as: evaluation board user manuals, application notes, getting started guides, software library documents, errata, and more.

Cortex-M cores are commonly used as dedicated microcontroller chips, but also are \"hidden\" inside of SoC chips as power management controllers, I/O controllers, system controllers, touch screen controllers, smart battery controllers, and sensors controllers.\n\nThough 8-bit microcontrollers were very popular in the past, Cortex-M has slowly been chipping away at the 8-bit market as the prices of low-end Cortex-M chips have moved downward.  Cortex-M have become a popular replacements for 8-bit chips in applications that benefit from 32-bit math operations, and replacing older legacy ARM cores such as [[ARM7]] and [[ARM9]].\n\n===License===\n[[Arm Holdings]] neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the processor architecture to interested parties. Arm offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. To all licensees, Arm provides an integratable hardware description of the ARM core, as well as complete software development toolset and the right to sell manufactured [[silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\n===Silicon customization===\nIntegrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) receive the ARM Processor [[Intellectual property|IP]] as [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] (written in [[Verilog]]). In this form, they have the ability to perform architectural level optimizations and extensions. This allows the manufacturer to achieve custom design goals, such as higher clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions (including floating point), optimizations for size, debug support, etc.  To determine which components have been included in a particular Arm CPU chip, consult the manufacturer datasheet and related documentation.\n\nSome of the silicon options for the Cortex-M cores are:\n* SysTick timer: A 24-bit system timer that extends the functionality of both the processor and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). When present, it also provides an additional configurable priority SysTick interrupt.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/> Though the SysTick timer is optional, it is very rare to find a Cortex-M microcontroller without it.  If a Cortex-M33 microcontroller has the Security Extension option, then it has two SysTicks, one Secure and one Non-secure.\n* Bit-Band: Maps a complete word of memory onto a single bit in the bit-band region. For example, writing to an alias word will set or clear the corresponding bit in the bit-band region. This allows every individual bit in the bit-band region to be directly accessible from a word-aligned address. In particular, individual bits can be set, cleared, or toggled from C/C++ without performing a read-modify-write sequence of instructions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>  Though the bit-band is optional, it is less common to find a Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 microcontroller without it.  Some Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers have bit-band. \n* Memory Protection Unit (MPU): Provides support for protecting regions of memory through enforcing privilege and access rules. It supports up to eight different regions, each of which can be split into a further eight equal-size sub-regions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>\n* Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM): Low-latency RAM that is used to hold critical routines, data, stacks.  Other than cache, it is typically the fastest RAM in the microcontroller.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <big>ARM Cortex-M optional components</big>\n|-\n! ARM Core !!

In the past, 8-bit microcontroller documentation would typically fit in a single document, but as microcontrollers have evolved, so has everything required to support them.  A documentation package for ARM chips typically consists of a collection of documents from the IC manufacturer as well as the CPU core vendor ([[Arm Holdings]]).\n\nA typical top-down documentation tree is:\n\n;Documentation tree (top to bottom)\n# IC manufacturer website.\n# IC manufacturer marketing slides.\n# IC manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip.\n# IC manufacturer reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family.\n# ARM core website.\n# ARM core generic user guide.\n# ARM core technical reference manual.\n# ARM architecture reference manual.\n\nIC manufacturers have additional documents, such as: evaluation board user manuals, application notes, getting started guides, software library documents, errata, and more. See [[#External links|External links]] section for links to official Arm documents.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[ARM architecture]]\n* [[List of ARM microarchitectures|List of ARM architectures and cores]]\n* [[Joint Test Action Group|JTAG]], [[Joint Test Action Group#Serial Wire Debug|SWD]]\n* [[Interrupt]], [[Interrupt handler]]\n* [[Real-time operating system]], [[Comparison of real-time operating systems]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==<!-- Note: this section name is linked from [[List of ARM Cortex-M development tools]] -->\n* ''Embedded Systems with ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers in Assembly Language and C''; 3rd Ed; Yifeng Zhu; 738 pages; 2017; {{ISBN|978-0982692660}}.\n* ''Designer's Guide to the Cortex-M Processor Family''; 2nd Ed; Trevor Martin; 490 pages; 2016; {{ISBN|978-0081006290}}.\n* ''ARM Assembly for Embedded Applications''; 3rd Ed; Daniel Lewis; 318 pages; 2017; {{ISBN|978-1543908046}}.\n* ''Definitive Guide to the ARM Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ Processors''; 2nd Ed; Joseph Yiu; 784 pages; 2015; {{ISBN|978-0128032770}}.\n* ''Definitive Guide to the ARM Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 Processors''; 3rd Ed; Joseph Yiu; 600 pages; 2013; {{ISBN|978-0124080829}}.\n* ''Digital Signal Processing and Applications Using the ARM Cortex-M4''; 1st Ed; Donald Reay; 250 pages; 2014; {{ISBN|978-1118859049}}.\n* ''Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers''; 5th Ed; Jonathan Valvano; 506 pages; 2012; {{ISBN|978-1477508992}}.\n* ''Assembly Language Programming: ARM Cortex-M3''; 1st Ed; Vincent Mahout; 256 pages; 2012; {{ISBN|978-1848213296}}.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|ARM Cortex-M}}\n;ARM Cortex-M official documents\n* {{Official website|https://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m|ARM Cortex-M official website}}\n* [https://community.arm.com/cfs-file/__key/telligent-evolution-components-attachments/01-2142-00-00-00-00-52-96/White-Paper-_2D00_-Cortex_2D00_M-for-Beginners-_2D00_-2016-_2800_final-v3_2900_.pdf Cortex-M for Beginners]{{snd}} arm.com\n* [http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ecm0359818/ECM0359818_armv8m_security_extensions_reqs_on_dev_tools_1_0.pdf ARMv8-M Security Extensions]{{snd}} arm.com\n* [https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Core/html/index.html Cortex-M Software Interface Standard (CMSIS)]{{snd}} arm.com\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
