It is south of [[Terenure]], east of [[Templeogue]], and is in the postal districts of [[Dublin 14]] and [[Dublin 16|16]]. It is within the administrative areas of both [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]] and [[South Dublin]] County Councils.\n\n==Area==\nBeyond Rathfarnham village itself, the broad area of Rathfarnham includes [[Whitechurch, Dublin|Whitechurch]], [[Nutgrove]], [[Ballyboden]] and [[Ballyroan, County Dublin|Ballyroan]]. Historical sites in the Rathfarnham [[townland]]s include: Scholarstown, [[Kilmashogue]], [[Mount Venus]], [[Tibradden]] and [[Taylors Grange]].\n\n==Features==\nRathfarnham is home to several notable historic buildings, including [[Rathfarnham Castle]] and [[Loreto Abbey]], four parks: [[Marlay Park]], [[Dodder Park]], [[Saint Enda's Park|St Enda's]] and [[Bushy Park, Dublin|Bushy Park]], and several pubs including [[Rathfarnham#The Eden|The Eden]], [[Rathfarnham#Buglers|Buglers]], [[Rathfarnham#Revels|Revels]] and the landmark Yellow House. [[Padraig Pearse]] established [[St Enda's School]] for Boys, which is now a museum in his honour situated in [[Saint Enda's Park]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history of Rathfarnham===\nThe name Rathfarnham (''Fearnain's [[Ringfort]]'') suggests an earlier habitation but no remains of [[Pre-historic|prehistoric]] fortifications, burial places, early churches or old records have been found.\n\n===From Norman times===\nThe written history of Rathfarnham begins after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. Terenurr and Kimmage (Cheming), both described as being in Rathfranham (sic) parish Dublin, are mentioned in an 1175 grant by Henry II to Walter the goldsmith ('Aurifaber') held at Canterbury Cathedral Archives.<ref>Grant CCA-DCc-ChAnt/C/1206 nd [MayxNov 1175]</ref>\n\nIn [[1199 in Ireland|1199]] these lands were granted to [[Milo le Bret]]. In 1199 he adapted an existing ridge to build a [[motte and bailey]] fort at what is now the start of the Braemor Road. It was apparently still in evidence up to the early 20th century.\n\nIn the following century no events of great importance are recorded as Rathfarnham, perhaps as it was protected on its south side by the ''[[Royal Forest]] of [[Glencree]]''. Rathfarnham became more exposed to attack when this deer park was overrun by the [[Clan]] [[O'Toole (family)|O'Toole]] from the [[Wicklow Mountains]] in the 14th century. [[Rathfarnham Castle]] was erected in part to protect the area from such attacks. [[Image:Rathfarnham Castle.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Rathfarnham Castle]]In addition, part of [[the Pale]]'s defences ran through the townland of Rathfarnham. Some traces of this are still extant.\n\n===From the 16th century===\nThe castle and much of the land around Rathfarnham belonged to the Eustace family of [[Baltinglass]]. However, their property was confiscated for their part in the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]] of [[1579 in Ireland|1579]]-[[1583 in Ireland|83]]. The castle and its lands were then granted to the Loftus family.\n\nIn the 1640s, the Loftus family was at the centre of the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] arising out of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. In [[1649 in Ireland|1649]], the castle was seized by the Earl of Ormonde's Catholic and Royalist forces before the [[battle of Rathmines]]. However they were granted it back by the English parliamentarians after their victory in that battle. Reputedly, [[Oliver Cromwell]] stayed in Rathfarnham Castle on his way south to the [[Siege of Wexford]].\n\nEconomic activity in Rathfarnham was stepped up in the 17th century and in the early 18th century many gentlemen's residences were erected. Two key examples were Rathfarnham Castle and Ashfield.\n\n====Rathfarnham Castle====\n[[Rathfarnham Castle]] itself was re-modelled from a defensive stronghold into a stately home. Lower [[Dodder]] Road is still marked by a [[triumphal arch]], from this era, which originally led to the castle. [[Image:Elys Arch Rathfarnham.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Ely's Arch]] The erection of this gateway is attributed to [[Henry Loftus, 1st Earl of Ely|Henry Loftus]], [[Earl of Ely]] from [[1769 in Ireland|1769]] to [[1783 in Ireland|1783]] who was also responsible for the classical work on the castle itself. The arch is named the ''new gate'' on [[Frizell]]'s map of [[1779 in Ireland|1779]]. After the division of the estate in 1913 the arch became the entrance to the [[Castle Golf Club]] but was later abandoned in favour of the more direct ''Woodside Drive'' entrance. The area around the arch is a haven for wildlife, with the nearby [[River Dodder]] home to [[brown trout]], [[otter]] and many water-birds including [[kingfisher]], [[dipper]] and [[grey heron]]. Woodside Estate is home to [[red fox]], [[rabbits]] and [[grey squirrels]].\n\n====Ashfield====\nAshfield, the next house on the same side, was occupied during the 18th century by Protestant clergy. In the early part of the 19th century it became the home of [[Sir William Cusac Smith]], [[Baron of the Exchequer]] and from 1841 of the Tottenham family who continued in residence until 1913. After this the Brooks of Brooks Thomas Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooksgroup.ie/ |title=Brooks Thomas |publisher=Brooksgroup.ie |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> occupied it until about twenty years ago when the estate was divided up and houses built along the main road. A new road was later built along the side of the house and named Brookvale after the last occupants.\n\n===Industrial revolution===\nAn industrial revolution, especially in the production of paper, began on the [[Owendoher]] and [[Dodder]] rivers and many mills were erected. In the beginning of the 19th century most of them switched to cotton and wool and later were converted to flour mills. The introduction of steam engines marked the end of this era and replaced the need for mills. Many of the old buildings fell into disrepair and were demolished, and their millraces filled in.\n\nA millpond and extensive mill buildings formerly occupied the low-lying fields on the west side of the main Rathfarnham road, just beside the bridge. On a map by [[Frizell]] dated 1779 it is called the ''Widow Clifford's mill and mill holding'' and in 1843 it is named the ''Ely Cloth Factory''. A Mr. Murray then owned it but in 1850, it passed into the hands of Mr. Nickson who converted it into a flour mill. His family continued in occupation until 1875 when John Lennox took over. In 1880 this mill closed down, the buildings were demolished and not a trace now remains.\n\n===Historical features===\n\n====Military Road====\n''See main article:'' ''[[R115 road]]''<br />\n[[Image:Sally Gap R115-R759.JPG|thumb|225px|right| The Military Road at the Sally Gap]]\nRathfarnham is the start of the [[R115 road|Military Road]].\nThis road through the [[Wicklow Mountains]] (still in use mainly for tourist traffic) was built at the beginning of the 19th century to open up the Wicklow Mountains to the [[British Army]] to assist them in putting down the insurgents who were hiding there following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. Rathfarnham itself was the scene of some skirmishes in the early days of the Rising which extended to the final battle in \"Raheen\" (now Raheen City) in County Wexford.\n\nConstruction commenced on 12 August 1800 and was completed in October 1809. The road starts outside the Yellow House, passes the head of [[Glencree]], with a spur down that valley to [[Enniskerry]], rises to the Sally Gap and then dips down to [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]], over the hills into [[Glenmalure]], and finishes at [[Aghavannagh]]. Well known sections also include the [[Featherbed Mountain]], the section below [[Kippure|Kippure Mountain]]. The total distance was 34 Irish Miles, of which the spur to [[Enniskerry]] was 5 Irish Miles.\nThe engineer in charge was Alexander Taylor (born in 1746), who was responsible for many other roads in the country, including some \"[[Toll road|Turnpike Roads]]\", which are [[Toll road|Toll Roads]].\n\n====Rathfarnham Road====\nAccording to many writers the road to Rathfarnham follows the same route as the [[Sl\u00edghe Chualann]], the ancient highway, which in the time of [[Saint Patrick]] was used by travellers between [[Dublin]], [[Wicklow]] and [[Wexford]]. This road is believed to have crossed the [[Dodder]] at the [[Big Bridge]], now [[Pearse Bridge]], and re-crossed it again near [[Oldbawn]], an unnecessarily inconvenient route, considering that a road through [[Templeogue]] to [[Oldbawn]] would not necessitate any crossing. The first record of a bridge being built here was in [[1381 in Ireland|1381]] and in [[1652 in Ireland|1652]] it was described by [[Gerard Boate]] in his ''[[A Natural History of Ireland]]'' as a wooden bridge which 'though it be high and strong nevertheless hath several times been quite broke and carried away through the violence of sudden floods.' After three bridges had been demolished by the river, between [[1728 in Ireland|1728]] and [[1765 in Ireland|1765]], the present structure of a single stone arch was erected in the latter year. This was widened on the west side in 1953 when it was renamed in commemoration of [[Patrick Pearse|Patrick]] and [[William Pearse]].\n\nIn 1912 during the construction of a main drainage scheme to Rathfarnham, a stone causeway was uncovered {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}} below the road level. It was {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and built of great blocks crossing the course of the river. Cut into the surface of the stone were a number of deep parallel grooves, as from the action of wheeled traffic over a long period. This was evidence for the existence here of a busy thoroughfare even before the construction of the earliest bridge.\n\n====The old graveyard====\nNext to Ashfield is the old graveyard containing the ruins of a church that was dedicated to [[Saint]]s [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]. This was a medieval church used for [[Protestant]] worship until [[1795 in Ireland|1795]] when it was found to be too small for the congregation and a new one was erected a short way off. The end walls of the old church still stand, the west gable containing a bell turret and the east pierced by a chancel arch, the chancel itself having disappeared. The north wall is gone and all that remains of the south wall is an arched opening.\n\nNear the entrance to the burial ground is the grave of ''Captain James Kelly'', an old [[Fenian]] who was associated with the [[Fenian Rising]] of [[1867 in Ireland|1867]]. He was organiser for the Rathfarnham district and was known in the area as '''The Knight of Glendoo'''. On one occasion when he was on the run he was hiding in the cellar of his business premises in [[Wicklow Street]] when police raided it. An employee named James Fitzpatrick who strongly resembled Capt. Kelly in appearance was arrested in error and was tried and sentenced to six months imprisonment, which he served without betraying his identity. Capt. Kelly died on 8 March 1915, aged 70.\n\nOn the opposite side of the road is [[Crannagh]] Park and Road, [[Rathfarnham Park]] and [[Ballytore]] Road, all built on part of the old Rathfarnham Estate. In the garden of a house formerly named ''Tower Court'' in Crannagh Road is an ancient circular pigeon house, a relic of [[Lord Ely]]'s occupation of Rathfarnham Castle. The entrance to this curious structure is by a low door on level with the ground and the inside is lined from floor to roof with holes for the pigeons. A later floor was inserted half way up, so as to make two rooms, and a second door broken through the wall at that level.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Rathfarnham Village====\nIn the castle grounds were several fish ponds which were supplied by a mill race taken from the stream which rises up at [[Kilmashogue]] and flows down through [[Marlay Park|Grange Golf Links]] and [[Saint Enda's Park]]. This served several mills before entering the fish ponds, whence it ran through the golf links while a smaller branch was conducted under the road to the flour mills which stood at the corner of Butterfield Lane, on the site later occupied by Borgward Hansa Motors Ltd.\nDescribed in 1836 as Sweetman's Flour Mills, it frequently changed hands before closing down in 1887. It was later operated as a saw mill. The dry mill race can still be seen here on the north side of Butterfield Avenue.\n[[File:Post Card brings van to your door (6363321657).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street, Rathfarnham, c. 1905]]\nRathfarnham [[Protestant]] [[Parish]] [[Church (building)|Church]] on the Main St was built in 1795 to replace the church in the old graveyard. Beside the church is the old school house that dates from early in the nineteenth century.\nImmediately adjoining is Church Lane at the corner of which is a bank built on the site of a [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] barracks that was burned down by [[Anti-Treaty IRA]] forces in September 1922 during the [[Irish Civil War]]. In the lane is an old blocked up doorway of an early eighteenth century type. Church Lane leads to Woodview cottages, which are built partly on the site of an old paper mill. The mill race previously mentioned passed under Butterfield Lane to the paper mill and continued on below Ashfield to turn the wheel of the Ely Cloth Factory. It was later turned into the Owen Doher River at Woodview Cottages. Until recently,{{when?|date=January 2020}} when the new road was made to Templeogue, the old mill race could still be traced through the grounds of Ashfield where its dry bed was still spanned by several stone bridges.\n\nThe paper mill, of which some old walls and brick arches still survive, has been described as the oldest in Ireland but there does not appear to be any evidence to support this. The earliest reference to a paper mill here is [[1719 in Ireland|1719]] when William Lake of Rathfarnham presented a petition for financial aid but we hear of one at Milltown as far back as [[1694 in Ireland|1694]]. In [[1751 in Ireland|1751]] William and Thomas Slater whose works were destroyed by fire in [[1775 in Ireland|1775]] made paper here. Archer's survey of [[1801 in Ireland|1801]] mentions two paper mills here, Freemans and Teelings, and both Dalton in [[1836 in Ireland|1836]] and Lewis in [[1837 in Ireland|1837]] state that one paper mill was still working and from 1836 to 1839 the name Henry Hayes, Rathfarnham Mill appears in the directories. If this can be identified with the mill at Woodview cottages it must have become idle soon afterwards as it is designated \"Old Mill\" on the 1843 edition of the O.S. map. In 1854 when this mill had neither water wheel nor machinery an attempt was made to re-open it for the manufacture of paper but it came to nothing. The mill race has now been completely removed to make way for a housing development.\n\nAt the end of the main street, on the right, the road to Lower Rathfarnham passes the site of the earliest Constabulary barracks. This closed down in 1890 when the establishment was transferred to a house named Leighton Lodge near Loreto Abbey.\n\n====Rathfarnham Lower====\nThe [[Catholic]] Church of the [[Annunciation]] was erected in 1878 to replace the old chapel in Willbrook Road. Outside the church door is a primitive type of font on a pedestal bearing the inscription ''FONT USED IN MASS HOUSE OF PENAL TIMES IN PARISH OF RATHFARNHAM FROM [[1732 in Ireland|1732]]''. The appearance of this font would suggest that it was originally a stone [[bullaun]] dating back to a period much earlier than the penal times.\n\nOn the opposite corner is the well-known Yellow House, a licensed premises built near the site of an inn of the same name which is marked on [[Alexander Taylor (engineer)|Taylor]]'s map of [[1816 in Ireland|1816]]. (The Catholic Church of the Annunciation (see above) is on the site of the original Yellow House). A tradition has been recorded by Mr. Hammond that in [[1798 in Ireland|1798]] a Michael Eades, who sheltered wanted men in his house, owned it. It was also frequented by the soldiers of the Rathfarnham Guard whose careless talk was carefully noted by the [[United Irishmen]] hiding on the premises. In [[1804 in Ireland|1804]] when the truth came to be known, the same military wrecked the place. Following Wilbrook road down between the Yellow House and the Annunciation, a large set of wrought iron gates can be observed. These gates, which now act as the pedestrian entrance to the Beaufort Downs housing estate, were originally the entrance to the Beaufort estate of the 18th century.\n\n====Nutgrove Avenue====\nA short distance past the church is Nutgrove Avenue, widened and extended during the 1960s to link up with [[Churchtown, Dublin|Churchtown]]. The old quiet tree shaded avenue has been completely swept away, along with the ''narrow lanes'' a cramped passage bounded on both sides by towering walls and full of right angled bends, which wended its crooked course between Loreto Convent cemetery and the garden of Nutgrove House. A massive gateway stood at the entrance to this avenue until about 1911, which bore the inscription ''Nutgrove School Established [[1802 in Ireland|1802]]''. In 1839 the school was under the supervision of Mr. Philip Jones, who continued to hold the post of principal until 1866 when the position was held by Mrs. Anne Jones. In 1876 the school closed down and the house was occupied as a private residence by various tenants becoming the parish council headquarters. The new avenue was laid through the former school grounds and the house, shorn of its ornamental gardens, stood with its front against the footpath. At some time the house had been disfigured with a rather unsightly concrete porch and the old brickwork covered with cement plaster, concealing the fact that this was a very interesting eighteenth century building containing a fine stairs and coved ceilings with good plaster decoration. Unfortunately the house fell into very bad repair and eventually was demolished. [[Weston St John Joyce|Joyce]] in his ''Neighbourhood of Dublin'' states that this house was at one time the [[dower house]] of [[Rathfarnham Castle]] but in this he is almost certainly mistaken, as [[Frizell]]'s map of 1779 shows that it was outside the estate. It is possible that he confused it with the other old house on the opposite side of the avenue which was formerly named [[Ely Cottage]], later altered to [[Ely Lodge]], and which was shown to be within the boundary of the estate. This house was in very bad repair but has recently{{when?|date=January 2020}} been restored in a very tasteful manner.{{says who?|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Loreto Abbey====\nLoreto Abbey in Lower Rathfarnham form a landmark visible for a number of miles south of the city.{{fact|date=January 2020}} It served as the headquarters of the [[Sisters of Loreto|Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n[[Image:Rathfarnham House, Loretto Abbey.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Rathfarnham House]]\nThe mansion which now forms the centrepiece of the group was built by Mr. [[William Palliser]] about [[1725 in Ireland|1725]]. No expense was spared in its construction and decoration, and its interior includes polished mahogany and, in one room, embossed [[leather wallpaper]]. William Palliser died in [[1768 in Ireland|1768]] without issue and [[Rathfarnham House]] passed to his cousin the Rev. John Palliser, who was rector of the parish.\n[[File:George Grierson, of Rathfarnham House by Gilbert Stuart (American, 1755-1828).jpg|thumb|left|150px|George Grierson ([[Gilbert Stuart]])]]\nAfter his death in [[1795 in Ireland|1795]] the house was purchased by [[George Grierson (printer)|George Grierson]], the [[Queen's Printer|King's Printer]] in Ireland, who resided here for a few years. When Grierson moved to his new abode in Woodtown in 1800 the house remained unoccupied until [[1821 in Ireland|1821]], when it was purchased by the Most Rev. Dr Murray for the newly founded Loreto Order.\n\nThe foundress Rev. [[Frances Mary Teresa Ball|Mother Mary Teresa Ball]] made a number of improvements to the place.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\nShe is said to have added a storey to the old house although there is no evidence from the exterior to support this. Many additions have been made over the years, the church was built in 1840, the novitiate in 1863 and six years later St Joseph's wing which contains the concert hall and refectory. St Anthony's wing was erected in 1896, St Francis Xavier's in 1903 and the Lisieux building in 1932 for the accommodation of visiting prelates to the [[Eucharistic Congress]]. In the 1920s, novice Agnes Bojaxhiu (later to become [[Mother Teresa]]) came to Loreto Abbey to learn [[English language|English]]. This was the language the Sisters of Loreto used to teach school children in [[India]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Clucas|first= Joan Graff|year=1988|title= Mother Teresa|url=https://archive.org/details/motherteresa0000cluc|url-access=registration|publisher= New York.

This house was occupied by Robert Hodgens J.P. (1793\u20131860) and then by his sons, John Conlan Hodgens and Henry Hodgens.<ref>Lewis's Topographical Dictionary, 1837</ref>  On the grounds is Loreto High School Beaufort which was founded in 1925.\n\n====The Ponds====\nLoreto Terrace on the north side of the Abbey was formerly known as '''The Ponds''', a name originating apparently from the large pond which two hundred years ago occupied the low lying field between Loreto Terrace and Nutgrove Avenue. This area was described in Weston St John Joyce's ''The Neighbourhood of Dublin'' in 1912 as \"the dilapidated locality known as the Ponds\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/Neighbourhood/chapter12.html |title=The Neighbourhood of Dublin, chapter 12 |publisher=Chaptersofdublin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> but it has since been largely rebuilt. An old photograph from Larry O'Connor's collection shows what it looked like at that time. The last of the old houses was demolished in the mid-1980s. It was a very early 18th century gabled residence named [[Grove Cottage]].\n\nThis place was the scene of a skirmish at the outbreak of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rising of 1798]]. The insurgents of the south county assembled at the Ponds on 24 May 1798 under the leadership of David Keely, James Byrne, Edward Keogh and Ledwich. The latter two had been members of Lord Ely's yeomanry but had taken to the field with the [[United Irishmen]]. The insurgents were attacked by the local [[yeomanry]] corps but were able to defend themselves and the yeomanry was forced to retreat. A party of regular troops was then sent against them and a stiff encounter took place. A number of the insurgents were killed or wounded and some prisoners taken including Keogh and Ledwich. The survivors retreated, joining up with a party from [[Clondalkin]], and a further engagement took place at the turnpike on the [[Rathcoole, Dublin|Rathcoole]] road where the enemy was successfully repulsed.\n\n====Grange Road to Harold's Grange and Taylors Grange====\nThe road to [[Harold's Grange]] continues southward from [[Loreto Abbey]]. The first is [[Snugborough]], which has its gable end to the road. The next is [[Washington Lodge]], its attractive 18th century facade hidden by a shrubbery. In later years new avenues have been laid out here on both sides of the road. Barton Drive, on the left, occupies the site of a house named Barton Lodge (occupied by William Conlan, a brewer in Dublin, until his death in 1829 - his daughter married into the local Hodgens family, who in the 1870s donated the lands for the Church of the Annunciation). On the other side is [[Silveracre]], once the home of [[James Henthorn Todd|Dr Henthorn Todd]], Professor of Hebrew in [[Trinity College, Dublin|T.C.D.]], who was connected by marriage to the Hudson family of the adjoining Hermitage estate. He was a well known Irish scholar and was the editor and translator of a number of Irish documents as well as the author of a life of St Patrick. He died here in 1869. About the middle of the last century the name of the house was changed to Silverton but it was later reverted to the original Silveracre. Most of the land is now built on. It was also the home in the early part of twentieth century of Surgeon Croly, who founded Baggot St Hospital.\n\n====St Enda's====\n[[Image:Pearse-Museum.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The Hermitage, site of St Enda's]]\nThe next estate on the same side is Hermitage or [[Enda of Aran|Saint Enda]]'s, the former home of [[Patrick Pearse]] and later of his sister [[Margaret Mary Pearse]]. The house, which is entirely faced with cut granite and has an imposing stone portico, was occupied in the eighteenth century by [[Edward Hudson (dentist)|Edward Hudson]], an eminent dentist. He had a passion for Irish antiquities, which he demonstrated in an unusual way by the erection of a number of romantic ruins around the estate. He built a small watch tower inside the boundary wall near the entrance gate and further along, a hermit's cave, a dolmen, a ruined abbey and beside a deep well, a tiny chamber with a stone bench and a narrow fireplace. At the corner of the road to Whitechurch the loopholed and crenulated structure known as the ''Fortification'', or ''Emmet's Fort'' was another of his creations. South of the house he built a grotto surmounted by a tall stone pillar, a [[Brehon's Chair]] and a fanciful construction consisting of two great boulders, one balanced on top of the other, which has since been demolished. Just inside the boundary wall he cut an inscription in [[Ogham]] on the two faces of a large rock. Translated they read: ''RIDENT VICINI GLEBASETS A KH A MOVENTEM EDUARDUM HUDSON''. In the pretty glen adjoining the [[Whitechurch road]] he erected a sort of temple with several small chambers and flights of steps. The estate was at that time known as the \"Fields of Oden\" and is so called on maps of the period. Within the grounds also, at the corner nearest to Whitechurch is an [[obelisk]], stated to have been erected by a former owner, [[Major Doyne]], over the grave of a horse that carried him through the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. The date however of Major Doyne's occupation does not support this. Meanwhile, P\u00e1draig Pearse wrote in An Macaomh that \"a monument in the wood, beyond the little lake, is said to mark the spot where a horse of Sarah Curran's was killed and is buried.\"<ref>http://pearsemuseum.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/An-Macaomh-Christmas-1910.compressed.pdf</ref> Unlike the constructions of [[Edward Hudson (dentist)|Edward Hudson]], which were purposely of the roughest material, this monument was of cut stone with small moulded pillars. After having been vandalized and toppled, it has since been re-erected without the pillars which were broken.\n\nEdward Hudson was succeeded by his son [[William Elliot Hudson]], who was born here in 1796. A distinguished scholar, he was a friend of [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Thomas Davis]] and [[Charles Gavan Duffy]] and was a patron of Irish literature and art. Shortly before his death in 1857 he endowed the [[R.I.A.]] with a fund for the publication of its Irish Dictionary and he also left the Academy Library a valuable collection of books.\n\nFrom 1840 to 1858 Hermitage was the home of [[Richard Moore (Irish lawyer)|Richard Moore]], [[Attorney General]], and in 1859 it came into the possession of [[Major Richard Doyne]], stated to be a veteran of the [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. From 1872 to 1885 it was occupied by George Campbell, merchant of 58 Sackville St., and after lying vacant for a few years it was tenanted by [[Major Philip Doyne]] of the [[4th Dragoon Guards]]. In 1891 Colonel [[Frederick le Mesurier]], barrister is returned as occupier and in 1899 Mr. [[William Woodburn]].\n\n[[St Enda's School]] was founded by [[Padraig Pearse]] in 1909 and was at first housed in [[Cullenswood House]], [[Ranelagh]]. Pearse felt that the confined surroundings of this house gave no scope for the outdoor life that should play so large a part in the education of youth, so in 1910 he leased Hermitage from Mr. Woodburn and moved his college here. A long billiard room was converted into a study hall and chapel, the drawing room became a dormitory and the stables opening off an enclosed square became class rooms. In \"The Story of a Success\" Pearse tells of the realisation of one of his life's ambitions and it was from here that he set off for the city on his bicycle for the last time on Easter Sunday 1916. After the rising the college continued to function under the care of Margaret Pearse until it finally closed down in 1935. After the death of Margaret Pearse in 1968 St Enda's passed into the hands of the state and has since been opened as a public park and home of the [[Pearse Museum]].\n\n====Priory====\nDirectly opposite to St Enda's was Priory, the home of [[John Philpot Curran]], at the time of Emmet's rising. The house was formerly named Holly Park but when Curran bought it in 1790 he changed the name to Priory. He lived here for 27 years at the peak of his fame and here he was to endure the tragic events, which cast a shadow on his private life. First the untimely death of his daughter Gertrude, followed by the loss of his wife, who left him for another man, and lastly the discovery of the association of his daughter [[Sarah Curran]] with [[Robert Emmet]]. [[Gertrude Curran]] died in [[1792 in Ireland|1792]] at the age of 12 as the result of a fall from a window. Curran had her buried in the grounds of the Priory and over the grave he placed a recumbent slab, on which was fixed a metal plate bearing the inscription:\n\n:''Here lies the body of Gertrude Curran''\n:''fourth daughter of John Philpot Curran''\n:''who departed this life October 6, 1792''\n:''Age twelve years''.\n\nThe position of the grave was clearly marked on the early editions of the O.S. maps. It was about midway along the northern boundary of the corner field facing the fortification, on the north side of the boundary bank and a few yards from it. It was formerly enclosed by a grove of trees, which can be seen in J. J. Reynold's photograph of 1903 but these were cut down about 1928. Some time later the stumps were dug out and the stone slab broken up and thrown on the adjoining bank. The metal plate had already been taken by souvenir hunters. It was [[Sarah Curran]]'s desire to be buried here also but to this her father would not agree as he had come in for criticism on the previous occasion for burying his daughter in unconsecrated ground.\n\nIn this district nearly every ancient site is associated in tradition with either [[Sarah Curran]] or [[Robert Emmet]] and it is not surprising therefore to find that this burial place has been suggested as the last resting place of [[Robert Emmet]]. This tradition goes back for well over a century and it is rather surprising that this site was not investigated when the search for Emmet's remains was being made at places a great deal less accessible and no less improbable.\n\nIn October 1979 the opportunity offered itself to carry out this investigation. The Priory estate was being developed and heavy machinery moved in to lay the roads and sewers. A Mrs. Bernadette Foley of nearby ''Barton Drive'' drew attention to the need to carry out this work before the site was buried for ever under a concrete jungle. With the co-operation of Messrs Gallaghers, the developers, a small group undertook to investigate the site. First the exact location was checked on the original large scale manuscript map in the O.S., next the field was carefully chained and the site marked to within a few feet and then a narrow trench {{convert|3|ft|m}} deep was dug through where the burial should have been. The result was a complete blank. A second and a third trench were cut at intervals until a large area had been investigated without finding any burial, timber, brick or stone.\n\nThe developers then offered to investigate further with the excavator and carefully cleared an area of {{convert|20|yd|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide to a depth of {{convert|4|ft|m}} without finding any sign of disturbance. They then deepened this area by another two feet with no better result. All the accounts of the burial state that it was made in a vault and it is therefore surprising and disappointing that no evidence whatever was found and there does not seem to be any obvious explanation for it. The builders, Messrs Gallaghers Ltd. were commended for their interest in this aspect of the site and their painstaking excavation work under the supervision of Mr. Leslie Black was expertly carried out.\n\nPriory was occupied by the Curran family until 1875 and subsequently by the Taylors until 1923. At the beginning of the century the house and gardens were still in good repair but after the Taylor's time the place was neglected. Twenty years ago the walls were still standing but little now remains but some heaps of rubble.\n\n====St Columba's College====\nSt Columba's College is a privately run, Church of Ireland co-educational boarding school with c. 300 pupils. It was founded in 1843 by the then Primate of Ireland, Rev. William Sewell. In 1849 the college moved from Stackallan House in County Meath to its present site in Whitechurch, Rathfarnham.  The headmaster of the college is addressed as 'warden' and the vice-principal as 'sub-warden'.  The college school day is split up during the winter - school classes end at 13:00 and there are games and other outdoor activities after lunch from 14:00 - 15:30. Classes recommence at 16:15 and continue until 18:00.  The school week consists of five days from Monday to Saturday with Wednesday and Saturday being half-days. The college has a very high academic profile but it also focusses a considerable attention on music, drama and art.  The college caters for a wide range of academic abilities and provides an excellent special-needs service for children with mild learning deficits.  The geographical layout of the college does not accommodate or facilitate wheelchairs.\n\n==Rathfarnham today==\n\n===Amenities===\nRathfarnham has a wide range of shops and businesses, including two bank branches, notably in the ''Nutgrove Shopping Centre''. The area's other shopping centre is the small ''Rathfarnham Shopping Centre''. The area also has a Garda Station and two post offices, and is home to the city's main ''animal shelter''.\n\n[[Marlay Park]] is a large open parkland, with a craft centre near the old \"big house\"; the park hosts [[marlay park concerts|major concerts]] every year. Aside from St Enda's, [[Dodder Park]] and Bushy Park (see above), Loreto park and small green spaces, the area also hosts two golf clubs.\n\nBoth fine buildings of Loreto Abbey and Rathfarnham Castle also provide amenity value.\nThere are a number of schools.\n\nRathfarnham also has a number of pubs on offer including The Orchard and The Blue Haven.\n\n===Organisations and sport===\n[[File:Rathfarnham_5_km_run_2016.png|thumb|Rathfarnham 5&nbsp;km Run (2016)]]\nRathfarnham is home to the [[Dublin Metropolitan Scout Province|13th Dublin]], the 14th Dublin, the 31st Dublin (which was founded in 1917) and the 68th Dublin [[Scouting Ireland|Scout]] troops and the [[Rathfarnham Girl Guides]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.lycos.co.uk/rathfarnhamguides/ |title=Rathfarnham Girl Guides |publisher=Members.lycos.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> The area is also home to the [[Rathfarnham Concert Band]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcbs.ie |title=Rathfarnham Concert Band Society - Homepage |publisher=Rcbs.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>\n\nFor [[Gaelic games]], there is the [[Ballinteer St John's]] [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] Club, and also [[Ballyboden St. Enda's GAA]] which is one of the largest GAA clubs in Ireland. Rathfarnham has a number of soccer teams including Nutgrove Celtic, Rathfarnham Punters, Rathfarnham Rovers, [[Leicester Celtic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/dublin-football-clubs/leicester-celtic.htm |title=Leicester Celtic Club Information |publisher=Soccer-ireland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> Broadford Rovers and Whitechurch United.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/dublin-football-clubs/whitechurch-united.htm |title=Whitechurch United Club Information |publisher=Soccer-ireland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>\n\nRathfarnham has a number of boxing clubs, including Whitechurch Boxing Club.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Rathfarnham WSAF Athletic Club clubhouse in the old courthouse, Rathfarnham Village, won the AAI National 10K National Road Relays and National Marathon in 2012.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Falling population===\nAccording to the 2006 Census,<ref>[http://www.cso.ie/census/2006_preliminaryreport.htm Census 2006 Populations of Electoral Divisions, 2002 - 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318092616/http://www.cso.ie/census/2006_preliminaryreport.htm |date=March 18, 2007 }}</ref> Rathfarnham has a population of 17,333 \u2013 a drop of 2.1% since 2002. The population has gradually decreased over the years from 17,760 in 1996 to 17,717 in 2002.\n\nThe number of people living around the neighbourhoods of Ballyroan and St Endas fell notably by 8% and 7% respectively. On the other hand, there were minimal increases in the Butterfield and Hermitage areas.\n\nOne thing that is clear from the statistics is Rathfarnham is aging, with young couples that moved into the area in the 1960s entering retirement. There is a lack of suitable and affordable homes for young people in Rathfarnham and consequently they are flocking out to neighbouring suburbs such as [[Templeogue]], [[Tallaght]] and [[Firhouse]].\n\nOver the last four years,{{when?|date=January 2020}} there have not been many apartment block developments in the Rathfarnham area. The figures reflect this reality. Due to the fact that there aren't many suitable sites in the area for apartment building, two analysts including the Rathfarnham Community Website,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rathfarnham.com |title=Rathfarnham Community Website |publisher=Rathfarnham.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> predicted that Census 2010 would show further decreases.\n\n===Culture and entertainment===\n\n====Music====\nRathfarnham has become the focal point of the summer music festival scene in Ireland. Between May and August every year, high profile acts put on concerts for thousands of people at [[Marlay Park]]. Acts in 2007 have included [[Damien Rice]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Crowded House]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Damien Rice]], [[The Who]] and [[Peter Gabriel]]. [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[The Killers]], [[Lenny Kravitz]]/[[Alanis Morissette]] played in the park during 2008 [[Metallica]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Dizzee Rascal]] and [[Calvin Harris]] played there on August 1 and 2 in 2009. Marley Park has also hosted the Longitude Festival every July since 2013.\n\n====Film location====\nA number of films have shot some of their scenes in Rathfarnham.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1wQ8UO8CPQ |title=YouTube \u2013 Rathfarnham in the Movies |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> The opening scene in [[Intermission (film)|Intermission]] was recorded at Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. In one scene in the movie [[Ordinary Decent Criminal]], a car is blown up in front of the Pearse Museum in St Enda's Park. The Secret Scripture was filmed in Loreto Abbey, Rathfarnham in 2015.\n\n===Pubs===\n''Buglers'' pub is situated in Ballyboden House on the Ballyboden Road in [[Ballyboden]]. John Blake was the first known publican to be granted the licence in 1799.\n\nSituated on Main Street, ''The Castle Inn'' is, as its name implies, near Rathfarnham Castle. The interior is made of stone and light wood and it is one of the newer pubs in Rathfarnham.\n\n[[File:YellowHouse 4856w.jpg|thumb|225px|right| The Yellow House, Rathfarnham]]\n\n''The Eden House'' pub is situated on Grange Road near [[Marlay Park]] and is one of the highest pubs in Rathfarnham. The building was formerly ''Eden House'', one of the 18th century stately houses on Grange Road, before being converted to its present use.{{fact|date=January 2020}} The pub was then sold in 2006 for \u20ac5.5m and is now run by owners of The Morgue Pub in [[Templeogue]] Village. The pub was completely renovated by the new owners, who awaited the completion of road works on the Grange Road before opening a new beer garden.\n\n''The Old Orchard'' is on Butterfield Avenue near Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. The interior has a contemporary \"European\" styling. The 'island' bar is an unusual feature and provides service around the full 360\u00b0, earning it its local [[nickname]] of the \"\"[[British threepence coin|thripp'ny bit]]\".\n\n''The Tuning Fork'' was an old-style pub situated at the junction of Willbrook Road and Whitechurch Road near the ''Yellow House'' pub. Now demolished.\n\n''The Blue Haven'' is a meeting spot for young people and business people, situated on the junction of Ballyroan Road and Butterfield Avenue.\n\n''The Yellow House'', is at the corner of Willbrook Road and Grange Road, a short distance from Rathfarnham Castle. It is believed that the first pub bearing the name was a thatched cottage standing on the site of the present [[Catholic]] church, and that the licence went back as far as the early eighteenth century. Certainly, it was in business at the time of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. Some say it was used during the rebellion as a meeting room for the rebellion leaders. A new Yellow House was built in [[1825 in Ireland|1825]] by Mary Murphy and opened for business in 1827. The current building dates from 1885 [http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=SC&regno=11216006 NIAH]. It was extensively refurbished and extended in 1979. According to local folklore, the poet [[Francis Ledwidge]] worked there for two days as an apprentice before homesickness for his home town of [[Slane]], [[County Meath]], caused him to leave.\n\n===Eateries and restaurants===\nPlaces to eat within Rathfarnaham include fish and chip shops, Chinese takeaways and fast food chains such as [[McDonald's]] located in Nutgrove Shopping Centre. In addition most pubs in the area serve food.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Transport===\nRathfarnham is well served by the [[Dublin Bus]] network. The following Dublin Bus routes serve Rathfarnam:\n\n* 16 from [[Ballinteer]] to [[Dublin Airport]] via the city centre\n* 15B from Stocking Avenue to [[Grand Canal Dock]] via the city centre\n* 17 to [[University College Dublin|UCD]]\n* 61 to [[Eden Quay]]\n* 75 to [[Tallaght]] via [[Firhouse]], and to [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] via [[Stillorgan]] or [[Sandyford]]\n* 161 to [[Rockbrook]] from [[Dundrum, Dublin|Dundrum]] [[Luas]] station\n\nThe 16 route was the first bus route in Dublin to have free [[Internet]] [[Wi-Fi]] onboard.\n\nIn 2007, it was proposed that a [[Luas]] tram line stated in a feasibility study as Line E\nwould be routed through Rathfarnham. However, it was found that the proposal would not be feasible, due to the fact that the road network from Rathfarnham to the city centre is not wide enough to accommodate [[Luas]] trams. The roads would only be capable of accommodating trams if a significant number of front gardens of houses along the route were purchased to allow for road widening. This would have been a highly costly undertaking, so the project was not progressed any further.\n\n==People==\n\n===People born in Rathfarnham===\n*[[Damien Duff]], Irish footballer\n*[[Danielle Galligan]], Irish actress from Rathfarnham\n*[[Stephen Gwynn]] (1864\u20131950), journalist, biographer, author, poet and Nationalist politician.\n*[[Sarah Curran]], fianc\u00e9e of executed Irish patriot [[Robert Emmet]] and subject of several popular ballads including \u201cShe is Far From the Land\u201d.\n*[[Joe McKinney]], Irish stage and screen artist\n*[[John Millington Synge|J.

It is south of [[Terenure]], east of [[Templeogue]], and is in the postal districts of [[Dublin 14]] and [[Dublin 16|16]]. It is within the administrative areas of both [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]] and [[South Dublin]] County Councils.\n\n==Area==\nBeyond Rathfarnham village itself, the broad area of Rathfarnham includes [[Whitechurch, Dublin|Whitechurch]], [[Nutgrove]], [[Ballyboden]] and [[Ballyroan, County Dublin|Ballyroan]]. Historical sites in the Rathfarnham [[townland]]s include: Scholarstown, [[Kilmashogue]], [[Mount Venus]], [[Tibradden]] and [[Taylors Grange]].\n\n==Features==\nRathfarnham is home to several notable historic buildings, including [[Rathfarnham Castle]] and [[Loreto Abbey]], four parks: [[Marlay Park]], [[Dodder Park]], [[Saint Enda's Park|St Enda's]] and [[Bushy Park, Dublin|Bushy Park]], and several pubs including [[Rathfarnham#The Eden|The Eden]], [[Rathfarnham#Buglers|Buglers]], [[Rathfarnham#Revels|Revels]] and the landmark Yellow House. [[Padraig Pearse]] established [[St Enda's School]] for Boys, which is now a museum in his honour situated in [[Saint Enda's Park]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history of Rathfarnham===\nThe name Rathfarnham (''Fearnain's [[Ringfort]]'') suggests an earlier habitation but no remains of [[Pre-historic|prehistoric]] fortifications, burial places, early churches or old records have been found.\n\n===From Norman times===\nThe written history of Rathfarnham begins after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. Terenurr and Kimmage (Cheming), both described as being in Rathfranham (sic) parish Dublin, are mentioned in an 1175 grant by Henry II to Walter the goldsmith ('Aurifaber') held at Canterbury Cathedral Archives.<ref>Grant CCA-DCc-ChAnt/C/1206 nd [MayxNov 1175]</ref>\n\nIn [[1199 in Ireland|1199]] these lands were granted to [[Milo le Bret]]. In 1199 he adapted an existing ridge to build a [[motte and bailey]] fort at what is now the start of the Braemor Road. It was apparently still in evidence up to the early 20th century.\n\nIn the following century no events of great importance are recorded as Rathfarnham, perhaps as it was protected on its south side by the ''[[Royal Forest]] of [[Glencree]]''. Rathfarnham became more exposed to attack when this deer park was overrun by the [[Clan]] [[O'Toole (family)|O'Toole]] from the [[Wicklow Mountains]] in the 14th century. [[Rathfarnham Castle]] was erected in part to protect the area from such attacks. [[Image:Rathfarnham Castle.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Rathfarnham Castle]]In addition, part of [[the Pale]]'s defences ran through the townland of Rathfarnham. Some traces of this are still extant.\n\n===From the 16th century===\nThe castle and much of the land around Rathfarnham belonged to the Eustace family of [[Baltinglass]]. However, their property was confiscated for their part in the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]] of [[1579 in Ireland|1579]]-[[1583 in Ireland|83]]. The castle and its lands were then granted to the Loftus family.\n\nIn the 1640s, the Loftus family was at the centre of the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] arising out of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. In [[1649 in Ireland|1649]], the castle was seized by the Earl of Ormonde's Catholic and Royalist forces before the [[battle of Rathmines]]. However they were granted it back by the English parliamentarians after their victory in that battle. Reputedly, [[Oliver Cromwell]] stayed in Rathfarnham Castle on his way south to the [[Siege of Wexford]].\n\nEconomic activity in Rathfarnham was stepped up in the 17th century and in the early 18th century many gentlemen's residences were erected. Two key examples were Rathfarnham Castle and Ashfield.\n\n====Rathfarnham Castle====\n[[Rathfarnham Castle]] itself was re-modelled from a defensive stronghold into a stately home. Lower [[Dodder]] Road is still marked by a [[triumphal arch]], from this era, which originally led to the castle. [[Image:Elys Arch Rathfarnham.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Ely's Arch]] The erection of this gateway is attributed to [[Henry Loftus, 1st Earl of Ely|Henry Loftus]], [[Earl of Ely]] from [[1769 in Ireland|1769]] to [[1783 in Ireland|1783]] who was also responsible for the classical work on the castle itself. The arch is named the ''new gate'' on [[Frizell]]'s map of [[1779 in Ireland|1779]]. After the division of the estate in 1913 the arch became the entrance to the [[Castle Golf Club]] but was later abandoned in favour of the more direct ''Woodside Drive'' entrance. The area around the arch is a haven for wildlife, with the nearby [[River Dodder]] home to [[brown trout]], [[otter]] and many water-birds including [[kingfisher]], [[dipper]] and [[grey heron]]. Woodside Estate is home to [[red fox]], [[rabbits]] and [[grey squirrels]].\n\n====Ashfield====\nAshfield, the next house on the same side, was occupied during the 18th century by Protestant clergy. In the early part of the 19th century it became the home of [[Sir William Cusac Smith]], [[Baron of the Exchequer]] and from 1841 of the Tottenham family who continued in residence until 1913. After this the Brooks of Brooks Thomas Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooksgroup.ie/ |title=Brooks Thomas |publisher=Brooksgroup.ie |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> occupied it until about twenty years ago when the estate was divided up and houses built along the main road. A new road was later built along the side of the house and named Brookvale after the last occupants.\n\n===Industrial revolution===\nAn industrial revolution, especially in the production of paper, began on the [[Owendoher]] and [[Dodder]] rivers and many mills were erected. In the beginning of the 19th century most of them switched to cotton and wool and later were converted to flour mills. The introduction of steam engines marked the end of this era and replaced the need for mills. Many of the old buildings fell into disrepair and were demolished, and their millraces filled in.\n\nA millpond and extensive mill buildings formerly occupied the low-lying fields on the west side of the main Rathfarnham road, just beside the bridge. On a map by [[Frizell]] dated 1779 it is called the ''Widow Clifford's mill and mill holding'' and in 1843 it is named the ''Ely Cloth Factory''. A Mr. Murray then owned it but in 1850, it passed into the hands of Mr. Nickson who converted it into a flour mill. His family continued in occupation until 1875 when John Lennox took over. In 1880 this mill closed down, the buildings were demolished and not a trace now remains.\n\n===Historical features===\n\n====Military Road====\n''See main article:'' ''[[R115 road]]''<br />\n[[Image:Sally Gap R115-R759.JPG|thumb|225px|right| The Military Road at the Sally Gap]]\nRathfarnham is the start of the [[R115 road|Military Road]].\nThis road through the [[Wicklow Mountains]] (still in use mainly for tourist traffic) was built at the beginning of the 19th century to open up the Wicklow Mountains to the [[British Army]] to assist them in putting down the insurgents who were hiding there following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. Rathfarnham itself was the scene of some skirmishes in the early days of the Rising which extended to the final battle in \"Raheen\" (now Raheen City) in County Wexford.\n\nConstruction commenced on 12 August 1800 and was completed in October 1809. The road starts outside the Yellow House, passes the head of [[Glencree]], with a spur down that valley to [[Enniskerry]], rises to the Sally Gap and then dips down to [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]], over the hills into [[Glenmalure]], and finishes at [[Aghavannagh]]. Well known sections also include the [[Featherbed Mountain]], the section below [[Kippure|Kippure Mountain]]. The total distance was 34 Irish Miles, of which the spur to [[Enniskerry]] was 5 Irish Miles.\nThe engineer in charge was Alexander Taylor (born in 1746), who was responsible for many other roads in the country, including some \"[[Toll road|Turnpike Roads]]\", which are [[Toll road|Toll Roads]].\n\n====Rathfarnham Road====\nAccording to many writers the road to Rathfarnham follows the same route as the [[Sl\u00edghe Chualann]], the ancient highway, which in the time of [[Saint Patrick]] was used by travellers between [[Dublin]], [[Wicklow]] and [[Wexford]]. This road is believed to have crossed the [[Dodder]] at the [[Big Bridge]], now [[Pearse Bridge]], and re-crossed it again near [[Oldbawn]], an unnecessarily inconvenient route, considering that a road through [[Templeogue]] to [[Oldbawn]] would not necessitate any crossing. The first record of a bridge being built here was in [[1381 in Ireland|1381]] and in [[1652 in Ireland|1652]] it was described by [[Gerard Boate]] in his ''[[A Natural History of Ireland]]'' as a wooden bridge which 'though it be high and strong nevertheless hath several times been quite broke and carried away through the violence of sudden floods.' After three bridges had been demolished by the river, between [[1728 in Ireland|1728]] and [[1765 in Ireland|1765]], the present structure of a single stone arch was erected in the latter year. This was widened on the west side in 1953 when it was renamed in commemoration of [[Patrick Pearse|Patrick]] and [[William Pearse]].\n\nIn 1912 during the construction of a main drainage scheme to Rathfarnham, a stone causeway was uncovered {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}} below the road level. It was {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and built of great blocks crossing the course of the river. Cut into the surface of the stone were a number of deep parallel grooves, as from the action of wheeled traffic over a long period. This was evidence for the existence here of a busy thoroughfare even before the construction of the earliest bridge.\n\n====The old graveyard====\nNext to Ashfield is the old graveyard containing the ruins of a church that was dedicated to [[Saint]]s [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]. This was a medieval church used for [[Protestant]] worship until [[1795 in Ireland|1795]] when it was found to be too small for the congregation and a new one was erected a short way off. The end walls of the old church still stand, the west gable containing a bell turret and the east pierced by a chancel arch, the chancel itself having disappeared. The north wall is gone and all that remains of the south wall is an arched opening.\n\nNear the entrance to the burial ground is the grave of ''Captain James Kelly'', an old [[Fenian]] who was associated with the [[Fenian Rising]] of [[1867 in Ireland|1867]]. He was organiser for the Rathfarnham district and was known in the area as '''The Knight of Glendoo'''. On one occasion when he was on the run he was hiding in the cellar of his business premises in [[Wicklow Street]] when police raided it. An employee named James Fitzpatrick who strongly resembled Capt. Kelly in appearance was arrested in error and was tried and sentenced to six months imprisonment, which he served without betraying his identity. Capt. Kelly died on 8 March 1915, aged 70.\n\nOn the opposite side of the road is [[Crannagh]] Park and Road, [[Rathfarnham Park]] and [[Ballytore]] Road, all built on part of the old Rathfarnham Estate. In the garden of a house formerly named ''Tower Court'' in Crannagh Road is an ancient circular pigeon house, a relic of [[Lord Ely]]'s occupation of Rathfarnham Castle. The entrance to this curious structure is by a low door on level with the ground and the inside is lined from floor to roof with holes for the pigeons. A later floor was inserted half way up, so as to make two rooms, and a second door broken through the wall at that level.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Rathfarnham Village====\nIn the castle grounds were several fish ponds which were supplied by a mill race taken from the stream which rises up at [[Kilmashogue]] and flows down through [[Marlay Park|Grange Golf Links]] and [[Saint Enda's Park]]. This served several mills before entering the fish ponds, whence it ran through the golf links while a smaller branch was conducted under the road to the flour mills which stood at the corner of Butterfield Lane, on the site later occupied by Borgward Hansa Motors Ltd.\nDescribed in 1836 as Sweetman's Flour Mills, it frequently changed hands before closing down in 1887. It was later operated as a saw mill. The dry mill race can still be seen here on the north side of Butterfield Avenue.\n[[File:Post Card brings van to your door (6363321657).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street, Rathfarnham, c. 1905]]\nRathfarnham [[Protestant]] [[Parish]] [[Church (building)|Church]] on the Main St was built in 1795 to replace the church in the old graveyard. Beside the church is the old school house that dates from early in the nineteenth century.\nImmediately adjoining is Church Lane at the corner of which is a bank built on the site of a [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] barracks that was burned down by [[Anti-Treaty IRA]] forces in September 1922 during the [[Irish Civil War]]. In the lane is an old blocked up doorway of an early eighteenth century type. Church Lane leads to Woodview cottages, which are built partly on the site of an old paper mill. The mill race previously mentioned passed under Butterfield Lane to the paper mill and continued on below Ashfield to turn the wheel of the Ely Cloth Factory. It was later turned into the Owen Doher River at Woodview Cottages. Until recently,{{when?|date=January 2020}} when the new road was made to Templeogue, the old mill race could still be traced through the grounds of Ashfield where its dry bed was still spanned by several stone bridges.\n\nThe paper mill, of which some old walls and brick arches still survive, has been described as the oldest in Ireland but there does not appear to be any evidence to support this. The earliest reference to a paper mill here is [[1719 in Ireland|1719]] when William Lake of Rathfarnham presented a petition for financial aid but we hear of one at Milltown as far back as [[1694 in Ireland|1694]]. In [[1751 in Ireland|1751]] William and Thomas Slater whose works were destroyed by fire in [[1775 in Ireland|1775]] made paper here. Archer's survey of [[1801 in Ireland|1801]] mentions two paper mills here, Freemans and Teelings, and both Dalton in [[1836 in Ireland|1836]] and Lewis in [[1837 in Ireland|1837]] state that one paper mill was still working and from 1836 to 1839 the name Henry Hayes, Rathfarnham Mill appears in the directories. If this can be identified with the mill at Woodview cottages it must have become idle soon afterwards as it is designated \"Old Mill\" on the 1843 edition of the O.S. map. In 1854 when this mill had neither water wheel nor machinery an attempt was made to re-open it for the manufacture of paper but it came to nothing. The mill race has now been completely removed to make way for a housing development.\n\nAt the end of the main street, on the right, the road to Lower Rathfarnham passes the site of the earliest Constabulary barracks. This closed down in 1890 when the establishment was transferred to a house named Leighton Lodge near Loreto Abbey.\n\n====Rathfarnham Lower====\nThe [[Catholic]] Church of the [[Annunciation]] was erected in 1878 to replace the old chapel in Willbrook Road. Outside the church door is a primitive type of font on a pedestal bearing the inscription ''FONT USED IN MASS HOUSE OF PENAL TIMES IN PARISH OF RATHFARNHAM FROM [[1732 in Ireland|1732]]''. The appearance of this font would suggest that it was originally a stone [[bullaun]] dating back to a period much earlier than the penal times.\n\nOn the opposite corner is the well-known Yellow House, a licensed premises built near the site of an inn of the same name which is marked on [[Alexander Taylor (engineer)|Taylor]]'s map of [[1816 in Ireland|1816]]. (The Catholic Church of the Annunciation (see above) is on the site of the original Yellow House). A tradition has been recorded by Mr. Hammond that in [[1798 in Ireland|1798]] a Michael Eades, who sheltered wanted men in his house, owned it. It was also frequented by the soldiers of the Rathfarnham Guard whose careless talk was carefully noted by the [[United Irishmen]] hiding on the premises. In [[1804 in Ireland|1804]] when the truth came to be known, the same military wrecked the place. Following Wilbrook road down between the Yellow House and the Annunciation, a large set of wrought iron gates can be observed. These gates, which now act as the pedestrian entrance to the Beaufort Downs housing estate, were originally the entrance to the Beaufort estate of the 18th century.\n\n====Nutgrove Avenue====\nA short distance past the church is Nutgrove Avenue, widened and extended during the 1960s to link up with [[Churchtown, Dublin|Churchtown]]. The old quiet tree shaded avenue has been completely swept away, along with the ''narrow lanes'' a cramped passage bounded on both sides by towering walls and full of right angled bends, which wended its crooked course between Loreto Convent cemetery and the garden of Nutgrove House. A massive gateway stood at the entrance to this avenue until about 1911, which bore the inscription ''Nutgrove School Established [[1802 in Ireland|1802]]''. In 1839 the school was under the supervision of Mr. Philip Jones, who continued to hold the post of principal until 1866 when the position was held by Mrs. Anne Jones. In 1876 the school closed down and the house was occupied as a private residence by various tenants becoming the parish council headquarters. The new avenue was laid through the former school grounds and the house, shorn of its ornamental gardens, stood with its front against the footpath. At some time the house had been disfigured with a rather unsightly concrete porch and the old brickwork covered with cement plaster, concealing the fact that this was a very interesting eighteenth century building containing a fine stairs and coved ceilings with good plaster decoration. Unfortunately the house fell into very bad repair and eventually was demolished. [[Weston St John Joyce|Joyce]] in his ''Neighbourhood of Dublin'' states that this house was at one time the [[dower house]] of [[Rathfarnham Castle]] but in this he is almost certainly mistaken, as [[Frizell]]'s map of 1779 shows that it was outside the estate. It is possible that he confused it with the other old house on the opposite side of the avenue which was formerly named [[Ely Cottage]], later altered to [[Ely Lodge]], and which was shown to be within the boundary of the estate. This house was in very bad repair but has recently{{when?|date=January 2020}} been restored in a very tasteful manner.{{says who?|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Loreto Abbey====\nLoreto Abbey in Lower Rathfarnham form a landmark visible for a number of miles south of the city.{{fact|date=January 2020}} It served as the headquarters of the [[Sisters of Loreto|Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n[[Image:Rathfarnham House, Loretto Abbey.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Rathfarnham House]]\nThe mansion which now forms the centrepiece of the group was built by Mr. [[William Palliser]] about [[1725 in Ireland|1725]]. No expense was spared in its construction and decoration, and its interior includes polished mahogany and, in one room, embossed [[leather wallpaper]]. William Palliser died in [[1768 in Ireland|1768]] without issue and [[Rathfarnham House]] passed to his cousin the Rev. John Palliser, who was rector of the parish.\n[[File:George Grierson, of Rathfarnham House by Gilbert Stuart (American, 1755-1828).jpg|thumb|left|150px|George Grierson ([[Gilbert Stuart]])]]\nAfter his death in [[1795 in Ireland|1795]] the house was purchased by [[George Grierson (printer)|George Grierson]], the [[Queen's Printer|King's Printer]] in Ireland, who resided here for a few years. When Grierson moved to his new abode in Woodtown in 1800 the house remained unoccupied until [[1821 in Ireland|1821]], when it was purchased by the Most Rev. Dr Murray for the newly founded Loreto Order.\n\nThe foundress Rev. [[Frances Mary Teresa Ball|Mother Mary Teresa Ball]] made a number of improvements to the place.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\nShe is said to have added a storey to the old house although there is no evidence from the exterior to support this. Many additions have been made over the years, the church was built in 1840, the novitiate in 1863 and six years later St Joseph's wing which contains the concert hall and refectory. St Anthony's wing was erected in 1896, St Francis Xavier's in 1903 and the Lisieux building in 1932 for the accommodation of visiting prelates to the [[Eucharistic Congress]]. In the 1920s, novice Agnes Bojaxhiu (later to become [[Mother Teresa]]) came to Loreto Abbey to learn [[English language|English]]. This was the language the Sisters of Loreto used to teach school children in [[India]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Clucas|first= Joan Graff|year=1988|title= Mother Teresa|url=https://archive.org/details/motherteresa0000cluc|url-access=registration|publisher= New York.

This house was occupied by Robert Hodgens J.P. (1793\u20131860) and then by his sons, John Conlan Hodgens and Henry Hodgens.<ref>Lewis's Topographical Dictionary, 1837</ref>  On the grounds is Loreto High School Beaufort which was founded in 1925.\n\n====The Ponds====\nLoreto Terrace on the north side of the Abbey was formerly known as '''The Ponds''', a name originating apparently from the large pond which two hundred years ago occupied the low lying field between Loreto Terrace and Nutgrove Avenue. This area was described in Weston St John Joyce's ''The Neighbourhood of Dublin'' in 1912 as \"the dilapidated locality known as the Ponds\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/Neighbourhood/chapter12.html |title=The Neighbourhood of Dublin, chapter 12 |publisher=Chaptersofdublin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> but it has since been largely rebuilt. An old photograph from Larry O'Connor's collection shows what it looked like at that time. The last of the old houses was demolished in the mid-1980s. It was a very early 18th century gabled residence named [[Grove Cottage]].\n\nThis place was the scene of a skirmish at the outbreak of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rising of 1798]]. The insurgents of the south county assembled at the Ponds on 24 May 1798 under the leadership of David Keely, James Byrne, Edward Keogh and Ledwich. The latter two had been members of Lord Ely's yeomanry but had taken to the field with the [[United Irishmen]]. The insurgents were attacked by the local [[yeomanry]] corps but were able to defend themselves and the yeomanry was forced to retreat. A party of regular troops was then sent against them and a stiff encounter took place. A number of the insurgents were killed or wounded and some prisoners taken including Keogh and Ledwich. The survivors retreated, joining up with a party from [[Clondalkin]], and a further engagement took place at the turnpike on the [[Rathcoole, Dublin|Rathcoole]] road where the enemy was successfully repulsed.\n\n====Grange Road to Harold's Grange and Taylors Grange====\nThe road to [[Harold's Grange]] continues southward from [[Loreto Abbey]]. The first is [[Snugborough]], which has its gable end to the road. The next is [[Washington Lodge]], its attractive 18th century facade hidden by a shrubbery. In later years new avenues have been laid out here on both sides of the road. Barton Drive, on the left, occupies the site of a house named Barton Lodge (occupied by William Conlan, a brewer in Dublin, until his death in 1829 - his daughter married into the local Hodgens family, who in the 1870s donated the lands for the Church of the Annunciation). On the other side is [[Silveracre]], once the home of [[James Henthorn Todd|Dr Henthorn Todd]], Professor of Hebrew in [[Trinity College, Dublin|T.C.D.]], who was connected by marriage to the Hudson family of the adjoining Hermitage estate. He was a well known Irish scholar and was the editor and translator of a number of Irish documents as well as the author of a life of St Patrick. He died here in 1869. About the middle of the last century the name of the house was changed to Silverton but it was later reverted to the original Silveracre. Most of the land is now built on. It was also the home in the early part of twentieth century of Surgeon Croly, who founded Baggot St Hospital.\n\n====St Enda's====\n[[Image:Pearse-Museum.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The Hermitage, site of St Enda's]]\nThe next estate on the same side is Hermitage or [[Enda of Aran|Saint Enda]]'s, the former home of [[Patrick Pearse]] and later of his sister [[Margaret Mary Pearse]]. The house, which is entirely faced with cut granite and has an imposing stone portico, was occupied in the eighteenth century by [[Edward Hudson (dentist)|Edward Hudson]], an eminent dentist. He had a passion for Irish antiquities, which he demonstrated in an unusual way by the erection of a number of romantic ruins around the estate. He built a small watch tower inside the boundary wall near the entrance gate and further along, a hermit's cave, a dolmen, a ruined abbey and beside a deep well, a tiny chamber with a stone bench and a narrow fireplace. At the corner of the road to Whitechurch the loopholed and crenulated structure known as the ''Fortification'', or ''Emmet's Fort'' was another of his creations. South of the house he built a grotto surmounted by a tall stone pillar, a [[Brehon's Chair]] and a fanciful construction consisting of two great boulders, one balanced on top of the other, which has since been demolished. Just inside the boundary wall he cut an inscription in [[Ogham]] on the two faces of a large rock. Translated they read: ''RIDENT VICINI GLEBASETS A KH A MOVENTEM EDUARDUM HUDSON''. In the pretty glen adjoining the [[Whitechurch road]] he erected a sort of temple with several small chambers and flights of steps. The estate was at that time known as the \"Fields of Oden\" and is so called on maps of the period. Within the grounds also, at the corner nearest to Whitechurch is an [[obelisk]], stated to have been erected by a former owner, [[Major Doyne]], over the grave of a horse that carried him through the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. The date however of Major Doyne's occupation does not support this. Meanwhile, P\u00e1draig Pearse wrote in An Macaomh that \"a monument in the wood, beyond the little lake, is said to mark the spot where a horse of Sarah Curran's was killed and is buried.\"<ref>http://pearsemuseum.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/An-Macaomh-Christmas-1910.compressed.pdf</ref> Unlike the constructions of [[Edward Hudson (dentist)|Edward Hudson]], which were purposely of the roughest material, this monument was of cut stone with small moulded pillars. After having been vandalized and toppled, it has since been re-erected without the pillars which were broken.\n\nEdward Hudson was succeeded by his son [[William Elliot Hudson]], who was born here in 1796. A distinguished scholar, he was a friend of [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Thomas Davis]] and [[Charles Gavan Duffy]] and was a patron of Irish literature and art. Shortly before his death in 1857 he endowed the [[R.I.A.]] with a fund for the publication of its Irish Dictionary and he also left the Academy Library a valuable collection of books.\n\nFrom 1840 to 1858 Hermitage was the home of [[Richard Moore (Irish lawyer)|Richard Moore]], [[Attorney General]], and in 1859 it came into the possession of [[Major Richard Doyne]], stated to be a veteran of the [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. From 1872 to 1885 it was occupied by George Campbell, merchant of 58 Sackville St., and after lying vacant for a few years it was tenanted by [[Major Philip Doyne]] of the [[4th Dragoon Guards]]. In 1891 Colonel [[Frederick le Mesurier]], barrister is returned as occupier and in 1899 Mr. [[William Woodburn]].\n\n[[St Enda's School]] was founded by [[Padraig Pearse]] in 1909 and was at first housed in [[Cullenswood House]], [[Ranelagh]]. Pearse felt that the confined surroundings of this house gave no scope for the outdoor life that should play so large a part in the education of youth, so in 1910 he leased Hermitage from Mr. Woodburn and moved his college here. A long billiard room was converted into a study hall and chapel, the drawing room became a dormitory and the stables opening off an enclosed square became class rooms. In \"The Story of a Success\" Pearse tells of the realisation of one of his life's ambitions and it was from here that he set off for the city on his bicycle for the last time on Easter Sunday 1916. After the rising the college continued to function under the care of Margaret Pearse until it finally closed down in 1935. After the death of Margaret Pearse in 1968 St Enda's passed into the hands of the state and has since been opened as a public park and home of the [[Pearse Museum]].\n\n====Priory====\nDirectly opposite to St Enda's was Priory, the home of [[John Philpot Curran]], at the time of Emmet's rising. The house was formerly named Holly Park but when Curran bought it in 1790 he changed the name to Priory. He lived here for 27 years at the peak of his fame and here he was to endure the tragic events, which cast a shadow on his private life. First the untimely death of his daughter Gertrude, followed by the loss of his wife, who left him for another man, and lastly the discovery of the association of his daughter [[Sarah Curran]] with [[Robert Emmet]]. [[Gertrude Curran]] died in [[1792 in Ireland|1792]] at the age of 12 as the result of a fall from a window. Curran had her buried in the grounds of the Priory and over the grave he placed a recumbent slab, on which was fixed a metal plate bearing the inscription:\n\n:''Here lies the body of Gertrude Curran''\n:''fourth daughter of John Philpot Curran''\n:''who departed this life October 6, 1792''\n:''Age twelve years''.\n\nThe position of the grave was clearly marked on the early editions of the O.S. maps. It was about midway along the northern boundary of the corner field facing the fortification, on the north side of the boundary bank and a few yards from it. It was formerly enclosed by a grove of trees, which can be seen in J. J. Reynold's photograph of 1903 but these were cut down about 1928. Some time later the stumps were dug out and the stone slab broken up and thrown on the adjoining bank. The metal plate had already been taken by souvenir hunters. It was [[Sarah Curran]]'s desire to be buried here also but to this her father would not agree as he had come in for criticism on the previous occasion for burying his daughter in unconsecrated ground.\n\nIn this district nearly every ancient site is associated in tradition with either [[Sarah Curran]] or [[Robert Emmet]] and it is not surprising therefore to find that this burial place has been suggested as the last resting place of [[Robert Emmet]]. This tradition goes back for well over a century and it is rather surprising that this site was not investigated when the search for Emmet's remains was being made at places a great deal less accessible and no less improbable.\n\nIn October 1979 the opportunity offered itself to carry out this investigation. The Priory estate was being developed and heavy machinery moved in to lay the roads and sewers. A Mrs. Bernadette Foley of nearby ''Barton Drive'' drew attention to the need to carry out this work before the site was buried for ever under a concrete jungle. With the co-operation of Messrs Gallaghers, the developers, a small group undertook to investigate the site. First the exact location was checked on the original large scale manuscript map in the O.S., next the field was carefully chained and the site marked to within a few feet and then a narrow trench {{convert|3|ft|m}} deep was dug through where the burial should have been. The result was a complete blank. A second and a third trench were cut at intervals until a large area had been investigated without finding any burial, timber, brick or stone.\n\nThe developers then offered to investigate further with the excavator and carefully cleared an area of {{convert|20|yd|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide to a depth of {{convert|4|ft|m}} without finding any sign of disturbance. They then deepened this area by another two feet with no better result. All the accounts of the burial state that it was made in a vault and it is therefore surprising and disappointing that no evidence whatever was found and there does not seem to be any obvious explanation for it. The builders, Messrs Gallaghers Ltd. were commended for their interest in this aspect of the site and their painstaking excavation work under the supervision of Mr. Leslie Black was expertly carried out.\n\nPriory was occupied by the Curran family until 1875 and subsequently by the Taylors until 1923. At the beginning of the century the house and gardens were still in good repair but after the Taylor's time the place was neglected. Twenty years ago the walls were still standing but little now remains but some heaps of rubble.\n\n====St Columba's College====\nSt Columba's College is a privately run, Church of Ireland co-educational boarding school with c. 300 pupils. It was founded in 1843 by the then Primate of Ireland, Rev. William Sewell. In 1849 the college moved from Stackallan House in County Meath to its present site in Whitechurch, Rathfarnham.  The headmaster of the college is addressed as 'warden' and the vice-principal as 'sub-warden'.  The college school day is split up during the winter - school classes end at 13:00 and there are games and other outdoor activities after lunch from 14:00 - 15:30. Classes recommence at 16:15 and continue until 18:00.  The school week consists of five days from Monday to Saturday with Wednesday and Saturday being half-days. The college has a very high academic profile but it also focusses a considerable attention on music, drama and art.  The college caters for a wide range of academic abilities and provides an excellent special-needs service for children with mild learning deficits.  The geographical layout of the college does not accommodate or facilitate wheelchairs.\n\n==Rathfarnham today==\n\n===Amenities===\nRathfarnham has a wide range of shops and businesses, including two bank branches, notably in the ''Nutgrove Shopping Centre''. The area's other shopping centre is the small ''Rathfarnham Shopping Centre''. The area also has a Garda Station and two post offices, and is home to the city's main ''animal shelter''.\n\n[[Marlay Park]] is a large open parkland, with a craft centre near the old \"big house\"; the park hosts [[marlay park concerts|major concerts]] every year. Aside from St Enda's, [[Dodder Park]] and Bushy Park (see above), Loreto park and small green spaces, the area also hosts two golf clubs.\n\nBoth fine buildings of Loreto Abbey and Rathfarnham Castle also provide amenity value.\nThere are a number of schools.\n\nRathfarnham also has a number of pubs on offer including The Orchard and The Blue Haven.\n\n===Organisations and sport===\n[[File:Rathfarnham_5_km_run_2016.png|thumb|Rathfarnham 5&nbsp;km Run (2016)]]\nRathfarnham is home to the [[Dublin Metropolitan Scout Province|13th Dublin]], the 14th Dublin, the 31st Dublin (which was founded in 1917) and the 68th Dublin [[Scouting Ireland|Scout]] troops and the [[Rathfarnham Girl Guides]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.lycos.co.uk/rathfarnhamguides/ |title=Rathfarnham Girl Guides |publisher=Members.lycos.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> The area is also home to the [[Rathfarnham Concert Band]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcbs.ie |title=Rathfarnham Concert Band Society - Homepage |publisher=Rcbs.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>\n\nFor [[Gaelic games]], there is the [[Ballinteer St John's]] [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] Club, and also [[Ballyboden St. Enda's GAA]] which is one of the largest GAA clubs in Ireland.

The population has gradually decreased over the years from 17,760 in 1996 to 17,717 in 2002.\n\nThe number of people living around the neighbourhoods of Ballyroan and St Endas fell notably by 8% and 7% respectively. On the other hand, there were minimal increases in the Butterfield and Hermitage areas.\n\nOne thing that is clear from the statistics is Rathfarnham is aging, with young couples that moved into the area in the 1960s entering retirement. There is a lack of suitable and affordable homes for young people in Rathfarnham and consequently they are flocking out to neighbouring suburbs such as [[Templeogue]], [[Tallaght]] and [[Firhouse]].\n\nOver the last four years,{{when?|date=January 2020}} there have not been many apartment block developments in the Rathfarnham area. The figures reflect this reality. Due to the fact that there aren't many suitable sites in the area for apartment building, two analysts including the Rathfarnham Community Website,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rathfarnham.com |title=Rathfarnham Community Website |publisher=Rathfarnham.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> predicted that Census 2010 would show further decreases.\n\n===Culture and entertainment===\n\n====Music====\nRathfarnham has become the focal point of the summer music festival scene in Ireland. Between May and August every year, high profile acts put on concerts for thousands of people at [[Marlay Park]]. Acts in 2007 have included [[Damien Rice]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Crowded House]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Damien Rice]], [[The Who]] and [[Peter Gabriel]]. [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[The Killers]], [[Lenny Kravitz]]/[[Alanis Morissette]] played in the park during 2008 [[Metallica]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Dizzee Rascal]] and [[Calvin Harris]] played there on August 1 and 2 in 2009. Marley Park has also hosted the Longitude Festival every July since 2013.\n\n====Film location====\nA number of films have shot some of their scenes in Rathfarnham.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1wQ8UO8CPQ |title=YouTube \u2013 Rathfarnham in the Movies |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> The opening scene in [[Intermission (film)|Intermission]] was recorded at Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. In one scene in the movie [[Ordinary Decent Criminal]], a car is blown up in front of the Pearse Museum in St Enda's Park. The Secret Scripture was filmed in Loreto Abbey, Rathfarnham in 2015.\n\n===Pubs===\n''Buglers'' pub is situated in Ballyboden House on the Ballyboden Road in [[Ballyboden]]. John Blake was the first known publican to be granted the licence in 1799.\n\nSituated on Main Street, ''The Castle Inn'' is, as its name implies, near Rathfarnham Castle. The interior is made of stone and light wood and it is one of the newer pubs in Rathfarnham.\n\n[[File:YellowHouse 4856w.jpg|thumb|225px|right| The Yellow House, Rathfarnham]]\n\n''The Eden House'' pub is situated on Grange Road near [[Marlay Park]] and is one of the highest pubs in Rathfarnham. The building was formerly ''Eden House'', one of the 18th century stately houses on Grange Road, before being converted to its present use.{{fact|date=January 2020}} The pub was then sold in 2006 for \u20ac5.5m and is now run by owners of The Morgue Pub in [[Templeogue]] Village. The pub was completely renovated by the new owners, who awaited the completion of road works on the Grange Road before opening a new beer garden.\n\n''The Old Orchard'' is on Butterfield Avenue near Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. The interior has a contemporary \"European\" styling. The 'island' bar is an unusual feature and provides service around the full 360\u00b0, earning it its local [[nickname]] of the \"\"[[British threepence coin|thripp'ny bit]]\".\n\n''The Tuning Fork'' was an old-style pub situated at the junction of Willbrook Road and Whitechurch Road near the ''Yellow House'' pub. Now demolished.\n\n''The Blue Haven'' is a meeting spot for young people and business people, situated on the junction of Ballyroan Road and Butterfield Avenue.\n\n''The Yellow House'', is at the corner of Willbrook Road and Grange Road, a short distance from Rathfarnham Castle. It is believed that the first pub bearing the name was a thatched cottage standing on the site of the present [[Catholic]] church, and that the licence went back as far as the early eighteenth century. Certainly, it was in business at the time of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. Some say it was used during the rebellion as a meeting room for the rebellion leaders. A new Yellow House was built in [[1825 in Ireland|1825]] by Mary Murphy and opened for business in 1827. The current building dates from 1885 [http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=SC&regno=11216006 NIAH]. It was extensively refurbished and extended in 1979. According to local folklore, the poet [[Francis Ledwidge]] worked there for two days as an apprentice before homesickness for his home town of [[Slane]], [[County Meath]], caused him to leave.\n\n===Eateries and restaurants===\nPlaces to eat within Rathfarnaham include fish and chip shops, Chinese takeaways and fast food chains such as [[McDonald's]] located in Nutgrove Shopping Centre. In addition most pubs in the area serve food.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Transport===\nRathfarnham is well served by the [[Dublin Bus]] network. The following Dublin Bus routes serve Rathfarnam:\n\n* 16 from [[Ballinteer]] to [[Dublin Airport]] via the city centre\n* 15B from Stocking Avenue to [[Grand Canal Dock]] via the city centre\n* 17 to [[University College Dublin|UCD]]\n* 61 to [[Eden Quay]]\n* 75 to [[Tallaght]] via [[Firhouse]], and to [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] via [[Stillorgan]] or [[Sandyford]]\n* 161 to [[Rockbrook]] from [[Dundrum, Dublin|Dundrum]] [[Luas]] station\n\nThe 16 route was the first bus route in Dublin to have free [[Internet]] [[Wi-Fi]] onboard.\n\nIn 2007, it was proposed that a [[Luas]] tram line stated in a feasibility study as Line E\nwould be routed through Rathfarnham. However, it was found that the proposal would not be feasible, due to the fact that the road network from Rathfarnham to the city centre is not wide enough to accommodate [[Luas]] trams. The roads would only be capable of accommodating trams if a significant number of front gardens of houses along the route were purchased to allow for road widening. This would have been a highly costly undertaking, so the project was not progressed any further.\n\n==People==\n\n===People born in Rathfarnham===\n*[[Damien Duff]], Irish footballer\n*[[Danielle Galligan]], Irish actress from Rathfarnham\n*[[Stephen Gwynn]] (1864\u20131950), journalist, biographer, author, poet and Nationalist politician.\n*[[Sarah Curran]], fianc\u00e9e of executed Irish patriot [[Robert Emmet]] and subject of several popular ballads including \u201cShe is Far From the Land\u201d.\n*[[Joe McKinney]], Irish stage and screen artist\n*[[John Millington Synge|J.

The Persian king [[Kavadh I]] needed money to pay his debts to the [[Hephthalites]] who had helped him regain his throne in 498/499. The situation was exacerbated by recent changes in the flow of the [[Tigris]] in [[Lower Mesopotamia]], sparking famines and flood. When the Roman emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] refused to provide any help, Kavadh tried to gain the money by force.<ref>Procopius.

The army was the largest Roman force in the East since [[Julian's Persian War|Julian's invasion of Persia]]. The force gathered at [[Edessa]] and [[Samosata]]. It operated in three divisions under commanders [[Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus|Areobindus]], ''[[strategos]]'' [[Patricius (consul 500)|Patricius]], and [[Hypatius (consul 500)|Hypatius]]. Hypatius and Patricius attacked Amida, which was held by a 3,000-strong garrison under [[Glones]].

According to Zacharias, their cavalry suffered heavily during the retreat, falling from the cliffs of mountains. Kavadh continued westward to [[Constantia]] but failed to capture it, though received supplies from its inhabitants. In early September, Kacadh reached near Edessa. Areobindus rejected Kavadh I's demand of {{convert|10,000|lb}} of gold in exchange for peace. Sasanians and [[Lakhmids]]s overran much of Osrhoene but attempts to attack the fortified city failed. Meanwhile, Byzantine forces under [[Pharesmanes]] attacked Amida, who killed the Sasanian commander [[Glones]] through cunning. This, together with Hunnic incursions, the arrival of Byzantine reinforcements, and Kavadh I's lack of supplies, all forced him to withdraw to Persia.

Patricius moved to Amida, defeated a force sent against him, and invested the city; Celer joined him later in the spring of 504. While the siege was ongoing, Celer raided [[Beth Arabaye]], while Areobindus raided [[Arzanene]]. Sasanian weakness at this point is apparent by defections to the Byzantine side by the renegade Constantine, a certain Arab chief Adid, and the Armenian Mushlek. The Byzantines eventually captured Amida. In the same year, an armistice was agreed as a result of an invasion of Armenia by the [[Hun]]s from the Caucasus. Negotiations between the two powers took place, but such was the distrust that in 506 the Romans, suspecting treachery, seized the Persian officials; once released, the Persians preferred to stay in [[Nisibis]].<ref name=\"Greatrex-Lieu (2002), 77\">{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=77}}.</ref> In November 506, a treaty was finally agreed, but little is known of what the terms of the treaty were.

This construction project was to become a key component of the Roman defenses, and also a lasting source of controversy with the Persians, who complained that its construction violated the treaty agreed in 422, by which both empires had agreed not to establish new fortifications in the frontier zone.

It was the first major conflict between the two powers since 440, and would be the prelude to a long [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars|series of destructive conflicts]] between the two empires over the next century.\n\n==Prelude==\nSeveral factors underlay the termination of the longest period of peace the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]] ever enjoyed. The Persian king [[Kavadh I]] needed money to pay his debts to the [[Hephthalites]] who had helped him regain his throne in 498/499. The situation was exacerbated by recent changes in the flow of the [[Tigris]] in [[Lower Mesopotamia]], sparking famines and flood. When the Roman emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] refused to provide any help, Kavadh tried to gain the money by force.<ref>Procopius.

The army was the largest Roman force in the East since [[Julian's Persian War|Julian's invasion of Persia]]. The force gathered at [[Edessa]] and [[Samosata]]. It operated in three divisions under commanders [[Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus|Areobindus]], ''[[strategos]]'' [[Patricius (consul 500)|Patricius]], and [[Hypatius (consul 500)|Hypatius]]. Hypatius and Patricius attacked Amida, which was held by a 3,000-strong garrison under [[Glones]]. Areobindus (together with [[Romanus (dux)|Romanus]] and ''[[phylarch]]'' [[Asouades]] attacked [[Nisibis]], in which Kavadh I was residing.<ref name=\"Heather\">{{cite book |last1=Heather |first1=Peter J. |title=Rome Resurgent: War and Empire in the Age of Justinian |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-936274-5 |page=77 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Areobindus gained the upper hand in Nisibis, but Kavadh I's counterattack defeated him, plundered his fort Apadna, and forced him to retreat westward; Hypatius and Patricius attempted to assist him, but it was too late.<ref name=\"Heather\" /> They failed to join with Areobindus and were decisively defeated between Apadna and [[Tell Beshme]] and retreated to Samosata. According to Zacharias, their cavalry suffered heavily during the retreat, falling from the cliffs of mountains. Kavadh continued westward to [[Constantia]] but failed to capture it, though received supplies from its inhabitants. In early September, Kacadh reached near Edessa. Areobindus rejected Kavadh I's demand of {{convert|10,000|lb}} of gold in exchange for peace. Sasanians and [[Lakhmids]]s overran much of Osrhoene but attempts to attack the fortified city failed. Meanwhile, Byzantine forces under [[Pharesmanes]] attacked Amida, who killed the Sasanian commander [[Glones]] through cunning. This, together with Hunnic incursions, the arrival of Byzantine reinforcements, and Kavadh I's lack of supplies, all forced him to withdraw to Persia. This further contributed to the reputation of Edessa as being impregnable.<ref name=\"Dodgeon\">{{cite book |last1=Dodgeon |first1=Michael H. |last2=Lieu |first2=Samuel N.

Patricius moved to Amida, defeated a force sent against him, and invested the city; Celer joined him later in the spring of 504. While the siege was ongoing, Celer raided [[Beth Arabaye]], while Areobindus raided [[Arzanene]]. Sasanian weakness at this point is apparent by defections to the Byzantine side by the renegade Constantine, a certain Arab chief Adid, and the Armenian Mushlek. The Byzantines eventually captured Amida. In the same year, an armistice was agreed as a result of an invasion of Armenia by the [[Hun]]s from the Caucasus. Negotiations between the two powers took place, but such was the distrust that in 506 the Romans, suspecting treachery, seized the Persian officials; once released, the Persians preferred to stay in [[Nisibis]].<ref name=\"Greatrex-Lieu (2002), 77\">{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=77}}.</ref> In November 506, a treaty was finally agreed, but little is known of what the terms of the treaty were.

The dilapidated fortifications were also upgraded at Edessa, [[Batnae]] and Amida.<ref>{{harvnb|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|p=74}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough no further large-scale conflict took place during Anastasius's reign, tensions continued, especially while work continued at Dara. This construction project was to become a key component of the Roman defenses, and also a lasting source of controversy with the Persians, who complained that its construction violated the treaty agreed in 422, by which both empires had agreed not to establish new fortifications in the frontier zone. Anastasius, however, pursued the project, deflecting Kavadh's complaints with money.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/belisariuslastro00ianh|title=Belisarius : the last Roman general|last=Hughes, Ian (Historian)|date=2009|publisher=Westholme|isbn=9781594160851|location=Yardley, Pa.|oclc=294885267|url-access=registration}}</ref> The Persians were in any case unable to stop the work, and the walls were completed by 507/508.<ref name=\"Greatrex-Lieu (2002), 77\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Primary===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Procopius|last2=Dewing|first2=H.

The region is extremely popular among tourists for its beaches on the [[Persian Gulf]] and proximity to the other countries of the eastern [[Arab world]], such as the [[UAE|United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]], with the latter being linked to the province via the 25 km (15 mi) long [[King Fahd Causeway]]. The region also shares a border with [[Oman]].

[[Petroleum|Oil]] was first found in the country in the Eastern Province, at the Prosperity Well site (formerly known as Dammam No.7). The [[Ghawar Field|Ghawar oil field]], located in the [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]], measuring 8400 sq.km.

The [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], located off the coast of the province, is the largest [[offshore oil field]] in the world.

For most of the early medieval period, the region was under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule until the advent of Islam under [[Muhammad]], and subsequently, the [[Islamic empires]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. After a brief period of [[British Empire|British]] rule during the early modern period, the [[Unification of Saudi Arabia]] led to the consolidation of the region into the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], which in 1932, was united into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Rub al Khali 002.JPG|thumb|248x248px|The [[Rub' al Khali|Rub' al-Khali]] or Empty Quarter, comprises more than a third of the Eastern Province]]\nApproximately two-thirds of the province is desert, comprising, from south to north, the [[Rub' al Khali]], [[Ad-Dahna Desert|Dahna]] and [[An Nafud|Nafud]] deserts, with the Rub' al-Khali alone comprising more than half of the area of the province. Areas such as [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]] and the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]] have become important sites for [[desert farming]] due to the advancements made during the [[Green Revolution]] in farming and irrigation techniques. \n\nThe entire eastern coast of the kingdom lies in the Eastern Province.

The Qarmatians attacked [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]] and held the [[Black Stone]] to ransom in Ahsa in 920 AD. The region was ruled by the Qaramatians until 976 AD, when after losing to the Abbasids, they were reduced to the status of a local power. After Bahrain and Qatif seceded from Qarmatian rule around 1058 AD, they retreated to the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], to which [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] laid siege and invaded in 1076 AD, ending the rule of Qarmatians in Ahsa and founding the [[Uyunid Emirate]]<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\nNot much is known of the Uyunids, except that they were the descendants of the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] tribe. They were involved in several internal disputes, causing the emirate to become unstable and eventually leading to the rise of the Bedouin Usfurids. The Usfurids saw a short period of stability. After overthrowing their former allies, the Uyunids, they had an uneasy relationship with the Persian rulers of Hormuz, who took control of the former Uyunid cities of Qatif and Bahrain around 1320 AD. This eventually led to the fall of the Usfurids. The region was mostly overlooked until the 1500s, when the [[Jabrids]] took over around 1507 AD, but they too fell due to internal conflicts in or around the 1540s<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\nIn 1551 AD, the Ottomans invaded the region during their [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)|first war with the Safavids]], and kept it under their control until 1671<ref name=\":4\" />. After several years of unrest between the Ottomans, Saudis and Rashidis, the [[Emirate of Nejd and Hasa]], also known as the Third Saudi State, under [[Ibn Saud]], liberated the entire [[Arabian Peninsula]] from Ottoman and [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Rashidi]] control. Most of the Eastern Province came under the Hasa region, and as such, the emirate has been under Saudi control since 1902.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Population pyramid|year=2016|mmax=8|fmax=8|m0=4.23|m5=4.53|m10=3.82|m15=3.41|m55=2.18|m75=0.2|m70=0.33|m65=0.48|m60=1.18|m35=7.76|m50=3.36|m45=4.88|m40=6.60|m30=6.58|m25=5.80|m20=4.45|m80=0.17|f60=0.67|f30=4.07|f35=3.78|f40=3.11|f45=2.20|f50=1.50|f55=1.05|f65=0.46|f5=4.03|f70=0.28|f75=0.21|f80=0.19|f15=3.02|f10=3.41|f0=3.98|f25=4.43|f20=3.63}}\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the General Authority of Statistics, the Eastern Province had a population of 4,900,325 as of December 2017<ref name=\":0\" />, of which 3,140,362 were Saudis and 1,759,963 were foreign nationals.

The region is extremely popular among tourists for its beaches on the [[Persian Gulf]] and proximity to the other countries of the eastern [[Arab world]], such as the [[UAE|United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]], with the latter being linked to the province via the 25 km (15 mi) long [[King Fahd Causeway]]. The region also shares a border with [[Oman]]. The province is bordered to the west, from north to south, by the provinces of the [[Northern Borders Region|Northern Borders]], [[Ha'il Region|Ha'il]], [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]], [[Riyadh Region|Riyadh]] and [[Najran Region|Najran]].\n\nThe Eastern Province encompasses the entire east coast of Saudi Arabia and acts as a major platform for most of the kingdom's oil production and exports. [[Petroleum|Oil]] was first found in the country in the Eastern Province, at the Prosperity Well site (formerly known as Dammam No.7). The [[Ghawar Field|Ghawar oil field]], located in the [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]], measuring 8400 sq.km. (3240 sq.mi.) is the largest oil field in the world<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/projects/ghawar-oil-field/|title=Ghawar Oil Field|website=Hydrocarbons Technology|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>, and accounts for roughly a third of the kingdom's oil production. The [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], located off the coast of the province, is the largest [[offshore oil field]] in the world. The Jubail Industrial City, part of the city of [[Jubail]], the fifth most populous in the province, is the largest industrial city in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/world-s-largest-industrial-areas.html|title=The World's Largest Industrial Areas|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe area was largely uninhabited until the [[Iron Age]], when a few people migrated over from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] empires. For most of the early medieval period, the region was under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule until the advent of Islam under [[Muhammad]], and subsequently, the [[Islamic empires]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. After a brief period of [[British Empire|British]] rule during the early modern period, the [[Unification of Saudi Arabia]] led to the consolidation of the region into the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], which in 1932, was united into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Rub al Khali 002.JPG|thumb|248x248px|The [[Rub' al Khali|Rub' al-Khali]] or Empty Quarter, comprises more than a third of the Eastern Province]]\nApproximately two-thirds of the province is desert, comprising, from south to north, the [[Rub' al Khali]], [[Ad-Dahna Desert|Dahna]] and [[An Nafud|Nafud]] deserts, with the Rub' al-Khali alone comprising more than half of the area of the province. Areas such as [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]] and the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]] have become important sites for [[desert farming]] due to the advancements made during the [[Green Revolution]] in farming and irrigation techniques. \n\nThe entire eastern coast of the kingdom lies in the Eastern Province.

The region stayed stable during the first three Islamic caliphates. \n[[File:IbnSaud.jpg|thumb|[[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] [[Ibn Saud]] is largely accepted to be the founder of present-day [[Saudi Arabia]], also known as the Third Saudi State]]During the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the region was taken over by the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] group of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] branch, around 899 AD. The Qarmatians attacked [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]] and held the [[Black Stone]] to ransom in Ahsa in 920 AD. The region was ruled by the Qaramatians until 976 AD, when after losing to the Abbasids, they were reduced to the status of a local power. After Bahrain and Qatif seceded from Qarmatian rule around 1058 AD, they retreated to the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], to which [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] laid siege and invaded in 1076 AD, ending the rule of Qarmatians in Ahsa and founding the [[Uyunid Emirate]]<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\nNot much is known of the Uyunids, except that they were the descendants of the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] tribe. They were involved in several internal disputes, causing the emirate to become unstable and eventually leading to the rise of the Bedouin Usfurids. The Usfurids saw a short period of stability. After overthrowing their former allies, the Uyunids, they had an uneasy relationship with the Persian rulers of Hormuz, who took control of the former Uyunid cities of Qatif and Bahrain around 1320 AD. This eventually led to the fall of the Usfurids. The region was mostly overlooked until the 1500s, when the [[Jabrids]] took over around 1507 AD, but they too fell due to internal conflicts in or around the 1540s<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\nIn 1551 AD, the Ottomans invaded the region during their [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)|first war with the Safavids]], and kept it under their control until 1671<ref name=\":4\" />. After several years of unrest between the Ottomans, Saudis and Rashidis, the [[Emirate of Nejd and Hasa]], also known as the Third Saudi State, under [[Ibn Saud]], liberated the entire [[Arabian Peninsula]] from Ottoman and [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Rashidi]] control. Most of the Eastern Province came under the Hasa region, and as such, the emirate has been under Saudi control since 1902.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Population pyramid|year=2016|mmax=8|fmax=8|m0=4.23|m5=4.53|m10=3.82|m15=3.41|m55=2.18|m75=0.2|m70=0.33|m65=0.48|m60=1.18|m35=7.76|m50=3.36|m45=4.88|m40=6.60|m30=6.58|m25=5.80|m20=4.45|m80=0.17|f60=0.67|f30=4.07|f35=3.78|f40=3.11|f45=2.20|f50=1.50|f55=1.05|f65=0.46|f5=4.03|f70=0.28|f75=0.21|f80=0.19|f15=3.02|f10=3.41|f0=3.98|f25=4.43|f20=3.63}}\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the General Authority of Statistics, the Eastern Province had a population of 4,900,325 as of December 2017<ref name=\":0\" />, of which 3,140,362 were Saudis and 1,759,963 were foreign nationals.

The [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]], which includes the traditional oasis of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa]] and the [[Rub' al Khali]] desert, which comprises more than half of the governorate itself, is the largest governorate in Saudi Arabia in terms of area.\n\n=== List of governorates ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Governorates of the Eastern Province\n!Name\n!Arabic Name\n!Population (2010)\n|-\n|[[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]]\n|{{Lang|AR|\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0621}}\n|1,063,112\n|-\n|''Principality of Dammam''\n|{{Lang|ar|\u0623\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0645}}\n|903,597\n|-\n|[[Khobar|Khobar Governorate]]\n|{{lang|ar|\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0631}}\n|578,500\n|-\n|[[Qatif|Qatif Governorate]]\n|{{lang|ar|\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u064a\u0641}}\n|524,182\n|-\n|[[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr Al Batin Governorate]]\n|{{lang|ar|\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u062d\u0641\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0637\u0646}}\n|389,993\n|-\n|[[Jubail|Jubail Governorate]]\n|{{lang|ar|\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u064a\u0644}}\n|378,949\n|-\n|[[Dhahran|Dhahran Governorate]]\n|{{lang|ar|\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646}}\n|120,521\n|-\n|[[Khafji|Khafji Governorate]]\n|{{lang|ar|\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u062c\u064a}}\n|76,279\n|-\n|[[Ras Tanura|Ra's Tanura Governorate]]\n|{{lang|ar|\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0631\u0623\u0633 \u062a\u0646\u0648\u0631\u0629}}\n|60,750\n|-\n|[[Abqaiq|Abqaiq Governorate]]\n|{{lang|ar|\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0628\u0642\u064a\u0642}}\n|53,444\n|-\n|[[Nariyah|Na'iriyah Governorate]]\n|{{lang|ar|\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0639\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0629}}\n|52,340\n|-\n|[[Qaryat al-Ulya|Qaryat Al Ulya Governorate]]\n|{{lang|ar|\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0627}}\n|24,634\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Saudi Arabia}}\n* [[Bahrain (historical region)]]\n* [[List of cities and towns in Saudi Arabia]]\n* [[Regions of Saudi Arabia]]\n* [[Shi'a Islam in Saudi Arabia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}<br />{{Geographic location\n| Centre    = Eastern Province\n| North     = {{flagicon|Kuwait}}[[Al Jahra Governorate|Al Jahra]] and [[Al Ahmadi Governorate|Al Ahmadi]] governorates, [[Kuwait]]\n| Northeast = {{flagicon|Bahrain}} [[Bahrain]]\n| East      = {{flagicon|Qatar}}[[Jariyan al Batnah]], [[Qatar]]<br>{{flagicon|UAE}}[[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Abu Dhabi]], [[UAE]]\n| Southeast = {{flagicon|Oman}}[[Ad Dhahirah Governorate|Ad Dhahirah]], [[Al Wusta Governorate (Oman)|Al Wusta]], and [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar]] Governorates , [[Oman]]\n| South     = {{flagicon|Yemen}}[[Hadhramaut Governorate]], [[Yemen]]\n| Southwest = [[Najran Region]]\n| West      = [[Riyadh Region]]\n| Northwest = {{flagicon|Iraq}}[[Al Muthanna Governorate]], [[Iraq]]<br>[[Northern Borders Region]]\n}}\n\n{{Regions of Saudi Arabia}}\n{{Saudi Arabia topics}}\n{{Saudi cities}}\n\n[[Category:Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia| ]]\n[[Category:Geography of Saudi Arabia]]\n[[Category:Provinces of Saudi Arabia]]\n", "name_user": "AccordingClass", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Province,_Saudi_Arabia"}
