The chief of the Powhatan people in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Wahunsenacawh]], had originally controlled only six tribes, but throughout the late 1500s he added more tribes to his nation, through diplomacy and/or force. He added the [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]] by 1598. By 1607, Wahunsenacawh controlled more than thirty tribes. The original six tribes under Wahunsenacawh were: the '''Powhatan''' (proper), the [[Arrohattoc|Arrohateck]], the [[Appamattuck]], the [[Pamunkey]], the [[Mattaponi]], and the [[Chiskiack]]. Some other affiliated groups included the [[Rappahannock Tribe|Rappahannocks]], [[Moraughtacund]], [[Weyanoak]], [[Paspahegh]], [[Quiyoughcohannock]], [[Warraskoyack]], and [[Nansemond]]. Another closely related tribe of the same language group was the [[Chickahominy (tribe)|Chickahominy]], but they managed to preserve their autonomy from the Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom. The Accawmacke, located on the Eastern Shore across the Chesapeake Bay, were paid nominal tribute to the Powhatan Chiefdom, but enjoyed autonomy under their own Paramount Chief or \"Emperor\", ''[[Debedeavon]]'' (aka \"The Laughing King\").\n\nBy early 1609, relations had begun to sour between the Powhatan and the English.  As a result Wahunsenacawh moved his primary residence from [[Werowocomoco]], off the York River, to Orapax (or [[Orapakes]]), located in a swamp at the head of the [[Chickahominy River]].  By 1614 Wahunsenacawh had again moved his primary residence, this time further northwest to a location on the north bank of the [[Pamunkey River]] known as [[Matchut]]. Matchut was not far from where Wahunsenacawh's brother [[Opechancanough]] ruled at [[Youghtanund]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n \nWahunsenacawh died in 1618, after which the chiefdom was ultimately passed to his younger brother [[Opechancanough]], who led the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]] as well as a second attack in 1644. Both attacks provoked English retaliations.  A peace treaty, signed in 1646, brought an end to the conflicts between the Powhatan and the English. The treaty was signed by Opechancanough's successor [[Necotowance]] \u2013 Opechancanough himself was captured by the English and killed by an English guard in 1646.<ref name=autogenerated2 >[http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/powhatan-indian-lifeways.htm Powhatan Indian Lifeways]</ref>\n\nAs part of the treaty of 1646, the size of Tsenacommacah was reduced. The boundaries specified in the treaty separated Virginia Indian lands from those that were considered English-owned, and restricted crossings to those on official business. Badges were required for all visitors. The treaty also established the payment of a yearly tribute to the English, as well as delineating a number of tribal land reservations.<ref name=autogenerate3 /><ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref>Wood, Karenne. The Virginia Indian Heritage Trail, 2007.</ref>  \n\nAmong the surviving tribes of the now-dissolved Confederacy, the [[Appomattoc]]s, [[Nansemond]]s and [[Weanoc|Weyanokes]] retreated to the south, becoming independent of Necotowance, as did the [[Powhite]]s or Powhatan proper. The [[Pamunkey]], [[Mattaponi]], [[Chickahominy people|Chickahominy]], [[Rappahannock tribe|Rappahannock]], [[Kiskiack]], [[Wicocomico|Wiccocomico]], [[Patawomeck]], [[Morattico]], [[Nanzatico]], [[Sekakawon]], and [[Onawmanient]], occupying the peninsulas north of the York, were cut off from the southern tribes by the English enclave.\n\nThe [[Virginia Colony]] long respected its southern boundary established by this treaty, refusing to recognize settlements beyond it as late as 1705. However, the ban on settling north of the York river was lifted September 1, 1649, and a wave of new immigrants quickly flooded the northern tribes, leaving them scattered and isolated on ever-shrinking patches of land.  That year, the Pamunkey ''weroance'', [[Totopotomoi]], received {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} for his tribe along both sides of the upper Pamunkey River,<ref>Helen Rountree, 1990, ''Pocahontas's People'', p. 110.</ref>  and the [[Kiskiack]] ''weroance'', Ossakican was reserved {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} on the Piankatank.<ref>Helen Rountree, 1990, ''Pocahontas's People'', p. 116.</ref> In 1650, another treaty reserved land for the creation of Indian towns, where {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of land was granted per warrior.  These lands became smaller and smaller in following years.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> Tracts were surveyed for the remaining tribes in the following decades, but these quickly shrank as they were either sold off or in some cases actually seized outright.\n\nFollowing [[Bacon's Rebellion]], the Treaty of Middle Plantation was signed by many Virginia Indian leaders in 1677, limiting Tsenocommacah even further.<ref name=autogenerate3 /><ref name=autogenerated2 /> The treaty set up six reservations, reinforced the annual tribute payment to the English, and more fully acknowledged the Virginia tribes' subjection to the King of England.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nAll of the reservations, save two, were lost over the next two centuries.  Even so, many of the remaining tribes still live in or near their ancestral lands.  The [[Pamunkey]] and [[Mattaponi]] are the only tribes that still maintain their reservations from the 17th century.  As such, these two tribes still make their yearly tribute payments, of fish and game, as stipulated by the 1646 and 1677 treaties.  As far as anyone knows, the tribes have not missed a \"payment\" in 331 years.  Every year, on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, they go to the Virginia Governor's house in Richmond to make their yearly payment.  A ceremony is held in which a deer, turkey, or fish and some pottery are presented to the governor.  Before the ceremony a brunch is held where the tribes are able to converse with the governor. It has not always been easy for the Mattaponi and the Pamunkey to get the necessary items for their yearly payment, but they have made it a point of honor to uphold their end of the bargain.<ref name=autogenerated4 >Waugaman, Sandra F. and Danielle-Moretti Langholtz, PhD.

June 7\u20139, 2009: Print.</ref>\n\n==Society==\n===Population===\n\nThe population of Tsenacommacah was 14,000 to 21,000 people by 1607. The tribes shared mutually intelligible dialects of the Powhatan Language. The language, however, died out by the 1790s after the people switched to English. Much of the language has been forgotten, and is only known from two wordlists made by [[William Strachey]] and [[Captain John Smith]]. However, there have been attempts to reconstruct the language, particularly from linguists like Frank T. Siebert and [[Blair A. Rudes]].\n\n===Lifestyle===\n\n[[File:Jamestownsettlement.JPG|thumb|Reconstructed Powhatan village at the [[Jamestown Settlement]] living-history museum.]]\nThe Powhatan lived in [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater Virginia]]. Their homes were called ''yehakins'', and they were made by bending saplings and placing woven mats or bark over top of the saplings.  All of Virginia's natives practiced [[agriculture]], and cultivated [[maize]]. A village became unusable as soil productivity gradually declined and local fish and game were depleted, so they periodically moved their villages from site to site. Villagers cleared the fields by felling, [[girdling]], or firing trees at the base and then using fire to reduce the [[Slash (logging)|slash]] and stumps. The natives also used fire to maintain extensive areas of open game habitat throughout the East, later called \"barrens\" by European colonists. The Powhatan also had rich fishing grounds. [[American Bison|Bison]] had migrated to this area by the early 15th century.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Hutch|date=Summer 2000|title=Wildland Burning by American Indians in Virginia|journal=Fire Management Today|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service|location=Washington, DC|volume=60|issue=3|pages=30\u201333}}</ref>\n\nThe Powhatan primarily used fires to heat their sleeping rooms. As a result, less bedding was needed, and bedding materials could be easily stored during daytime hours. Couples typically slept head to foot.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Rountree|first=Helen C.|date=1998|title=Powhatan Indian Women: The People Captain John Smith Barely Saw|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=45|issue=1|pages=1\u201329|doi=10.2307/483170|issn=0014-1801|jstor=483170}}</ref>\n\nPowhatan men were warriors and hunters, and would run and walk extensively through the woods in pursuit of enemies or game, while women were gardeners and gatherers and would spend hours tending crops, pounding corn into meal, gathering nuts, and performing other chores. The women would construct hunting camps when the men were gone for extended periods of time. Women were also believed to serve as barbers, decorate homes, and produce decorative clothing. The Powhatan domestic economy depended on the labor of both sexes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsmith400.org/2TheChesapeakeBayRegionanditsPeoplein1607.pdf|title=\"The Chesapeake Bay Region and its People in 1607\"<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n\nThe native Powhatan religion has been well documented. The Powhatans believed in two primary Gods. Ahone was the creator and giver of good things. Oke was an evil spirit who gave bad things. Beneath these two were many other spirits. The Powhatan tried to appease Oke with various offerings such as jewelry and tobacco. Religious leaders were advisors to tribal leaders.<ref>https://www.historyisfun.org/learn/learning-center/how-did-the-powhatan-express-their-religious-beliefs/</ref> It is believed that Powhatans would make offerings and pray to the sun during sunrises.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Government==\n===Capitals===\n\nTsenacommacah originally had two capitals. The main capital was the village of [[Werowocomoco]], located in present-day Gloucester County. The second capital, the village of Powhatan was believed to be in the present-day Powhatan Hill section of the eastern part of [[Richmond, Virginia]], or perhaps nearby in a location which became part of Tree Hill Farm.\n\nWerowocomoco was described by the English colonists as only {{convert|15|mi|km}} as the crow flies from Jamestown, but also described as {{convert|25|mi|km}} downstream from present-day [[West Point, Virginia|West Point]], measurements which conflict with each other. In 2003 archaeologists initiated excavations at a site in Gloucester County that have revealed an extensive indigenous settlement from about 1200 (the late [[Woodland]] period) through the early Contact period. Work since then has added to their belief that this is the location of Werowocomoco. The site is on a farm bordering on Purtain Bay of the York River, about {{convert|12|nmi|km|sigfig=2}} from Jamestown. The more than {{convert|50|acre|m2|sigfig=2}} residential settlement extends up to {{convert|1000|ft|m|sigfig=1}} back from the river. In 2004, researchers excavated two curving ditches of {{convert|200|ft|m|sigfig=1}} at the far edge, which were constructed about 1400 CE. In addition to extensive artifacts from hundreds of years of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] settlement, researchers have found a variety of trade goods related to the brief interaction of Native Americans and English in the early years of Jamestown.\n\nAround 1609, Wahunsenacawh shifted his capital from Werowocomoco to ''[[Orapakes]]'', located in a swamp at the head of the [[Chickahominy River]], near the modern-day interchange of [[Interstate 64]] and [[Interstate 295 (Virginia)|Interstate 295]]. Sometime between 1611 and 1614, he moved further north to ''[[Matchut]]'', in present-day [[King William County, Virginia|King William County]] on the north bank of the [[Pamunkey River]].\n\n===Leadership===\n\nEach tribe had its own name and chief (''werowance''/''weroance'' or ''weroansqua'' if female), and Tsenacommacah as a whole was ruled by a paramount chief (''mamanatowick'') named Wahunsenacawh, or more popularly [[Chief Powhatan]].<ref name=autogenerated1 >Rountree, Helen C. Pocahontas, Powhatan, Opechancanough: Three Indian Lives Changed by Jamestown. University of Virginia Press, 2005.</ref>\n\nThe Mamanatowick let their district and subordinate weroances make the final decision on how to handle hostile situations. This was made apparent with the events that took place in 1607 and the hostility with the newcomers (English settlers). Weroances and Priest were the only ones allowed to enter into religious temples. A weroance did not go to meet any visitor, visitors were escorted to see a weroance. The weroance, their wives, and councilors often dressed in the finest jewels, and tanned deer skin.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rountree|first1=Helen C.|title=Pocahontas, Powhatan, Opechancanough : three Indian lives changed by Jamestown|date=2005|publisher=University of Virginia press|location=Charlottesville (Va.)|isbn=0-8139-2323-9|page=Chapter 2}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of the weroances' personal names were known and some recorded by [[William Strachey]] and other sources.<ref>[http://www.mariner.org/chesapeakebay/native/nam031.html List of weroances recorded by Strachey]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509192841/http://www.mariner.org/chesapeakebay/native/nam031.html |date=May 9, 2008 }}</ref> The names of their respective chieftaincies were also commonly used as titles, exactly analogous to European peerages, so that the Weroance of Arrohattec (whose given name was Ashaquid) was often referred to simply as \"Arrohattec\", much as the Earl of Essex would be referred to just as \"Essex\" in lieu of a personal name.\n\nWhen the English arrived in Virginia, some of the weroances subject to the paramount chief Powhatan, or ''mamanatowick'' (Wahunsenacawh) were his own nearest male relatives:\n\n* Parahunt, Weroance of the Powhatan (proper), also called ''Tanx'' (\"little\") Powhatan, said by Strachey to be a son of the paramount chief Powhatan, and often confused with same.\n* Pochins, Weroance of the [[Kecoughtan]], was also a son of the paramount chief, whom he had appointed there some time after slaying their previous ruler in ca. 1598.  \n*[[Opechancanough]], Chief Powhatan's younger brother, was a weroance of the [[Pamunkey]], but increased in power, and came to be the effective ruler of the entire Powhatan Confederacy after [[Wahunsenacawh]]'s death in 1618.\n\nIn Tsenacommacah, women could inherit power, because the inheritance of power was [[matrilineal]]. In ''A Map of Virginia'' [[John Smith of Jamestown]] explains:<blockquote>His <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Chief Powhatan]]'s] kingdome descendeth not to his sonnes nor children: but first to his brethren, whereof he hath 3 namely [[Opitchapan]], [[Opechancanough]], and [[Catataugh]]; and after their decease to his sisters. First to the eldest sister, then to the rest: and after them to the heires male and female of the eldest sister; but never to the heires of the males.<ref>Smith, John. ''A Map of Virginia.''

Matchut was not far from where Wahunsenacawh's brother [[Opechancanough]] ruled at [[Youghtanund]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n \nWahunsenacawh died in 1618, after which the chiefdom was ultimately passed to his younger brother [[Opechancanough]], who led the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]] as well as a second attack in 1644. Both attacks provoked English retaliations.  A peace treaty, signed in 1646, brought an end to the conflicts between the Powhatan and the English. The treaty was signed by Opechancanough's successor [[Necotowance]] \u2013 Opechancanough himself was captured by the English and killed by an English guard in 1646.<ref name=autogenerated2 >[http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/powhatan-indian-lifeways.htm Powhatan Indian Lifeways]</ref>\n\nAs part of the treaty of 1646, the size of Tsenacommacah was reduced. The boundaries specified in the treaty separated Virginia Indian lands from those that were considered English-owned, and restricted crossings to those on official business. Badges were required for all visitors. The treaty also established the payment of a yearly tribute to the English, as well as delineating a number of tribal land reservations.<ref name=autogenerate3 /><ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref>Wood, Karenne. The Virginia Indian Heritage Trail, 2007.</ref>  \n\nAmong the surviving tribes of the now-dissolved Confederacy, the [[Appomattoc]]s, [[Nansemond]]s and [[Weanoc|Weyanokes]] retreated to the south, becoming independent of Necotowance, as did the [[Powhite]]s or Powhatan proper. The [[Pamunkey]], [[Mattaponi]], [[Chickahominy people|Chickahominy]], [[Rappahannock tribe|Rappahannock]], [[Kiskiack]], [[Wicocomico|Wiccocomico]], [[Patawomeck]], [[Morattico]], [[Nanzatico]], [[Sekakawon]], and [[Onawmanient]], occupying the peninsulas north of the York, were cut off from the southern tribes by the English enclave.\n\nThe [[Virginia Colony]] long respected its southern boundary established by this treaty, refusing to recognize settlements beyond it as late as 1705. However, the ban on settling north of the York river was lifted September 1, 1649, and a wave of new immigrants quickly flooded the northern tribes, leaving them scattered and isolated on ever-shrinking patches of land.  That year, the Pamunkey ''weroance'', [[Totopotomoi]], received {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} for his tribe along both sides of the upper Pamunkey River,<ref>Helen Rountree, 1990, ''Pocahontas's People'', p. 110.</ref>  and the [[Kiskiack]] ''weroance'', Ossakican was reserved {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} on the Piankatank.<ref>Helen Rountree, 1990, ''Pocahontas's People'', p. 116.</ref> In 1650, another treaty reserved land for the creation of Indian towns, where {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of land was granted per warrior.  These lands became smaller and smaller in following years.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> Tracts were surveyed for the remaining tribes in the following decades, but these quickly shrank as they were either sold off or in some cases actually seized outright.\n\nFollowing [[Bacon's Rebellion]], The Treaty of Middle Plantation was signed by many Virginia Indian leaders in 1677, limiting Tsenocommacah even further.<ref name=autogenerate3 /><ref name=autogenerated2 /> The treaty set up six reservations, reinforced the annual tribute payment to the English, and more fully acknowledged the Virginia tribes' subjection to the King of England.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nAll of the reservations, save two, were lost over the next two centuries.  Even so, many of the remaining tribes still live in or near their ancestral lands.  The [[Pamunkey]] and [[Mattaponi]] are the only tribes that still maintain their reservations from the 17th century.  As such, these two tribes still make their yearly tribute payments, of fish and game, as stipulated by the 1646 and 1677 treaties.  As far as anyone knows, the tribes have not missed a \"payment\" in 331 years.  Every year, on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, they go to the Virginia Governor's house in Richmond to make their yearly payment.  A ceremony is held in which a deer, turkey, or fish and some pottery are presented to the governor.  Before the ceremony a brunch is held where the tribes are able to converse with the governor. It has not always been easy for the Mattaponi and the Pamunkey to get the necessary items for their yearly payment, but they have made it a point of honor to uphold their end of the bargain.<ref name=autogenerated4 >Waugaman, Sandra F. and Danielle-Moretti Langholtz, PhD.

June 7\u20139, 2009: Print.</ref>\n\n==Society==\n===Population===\n\nThe population of Tsenacommacah was 14,000 to 21,000 people by 1607. The tribes shared mutually intelligible dialects of the Powhatan Language. The language, however, died out by the 1790s after the people switched to English. Much of the language has been forgotten, and is only known from two wordlists made by [[William Strachey]] and [[Captain John Smith]]. However, there have been attempts to reconstruct the language, particularly from linguists like Frank T. Siebert and [[Blair A. Rudes]].\n\n===Lifestyle===\n\n[[File:Jamestownsettlement.JPG|thumb|Reconstructed Powhatan village at the [[Jamestown Settlement]] living-history museum.]]\nThe Powhatan lived in [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater Virginia]]. Their homes were called ''yehakins'', and they were made by bending saplings and placing woven mats or bark over top of the saplings.  All of Virginia's natives practiced [[agriculture]], and cultivated [[maize]]. A village became unusable as soil productivity gradually declined and local fish and game were depleted, so they periodically moved their villages from site to site. Villagers cleared the fields by felling, [[girdling]], or firing trees at the base and then using fire to reduce the [[Slash (logging)|slash]] and stumps. The natives also used fire to maintain extensive areas of open game habitat throughout the East, later called \"barrens\" by European colonists. The Powhatan also had rich fishing grounds. [[American Bison|Bison]] had migrated to this area by the early 15th century.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Hutch|date=Summer 2000|title=Wildland Burning by American Indians in Virginia|journal=Fire Management Today|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service|location=Washington, DC|volume=60|issue=3|pages=30\u201333}}</ref>\n\nThe Powhatan primarily used fires to heat their sleeping rooms. As a result, less bedding was needed, and bedding materials could be easily stored during daytime hours. Couples typically slept head to foot.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Rountree|first=Helen C.|date=1998|title=Powhatan Indian Women: The People Captain John Smith Barely Saw|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=45|issue=1|pages=1\u201329|doi=10.2307/483170|issn=0014-1801|jstor=483170}}</ref>\n\nPowhatan men were warriors and hunters, and would run and walk extensively through the woods in pursuit of enemies or game, while women were gardeners and gatherers and would spend hours tending crops, pounding corn into meal, gathering nuts, and performing other chores. The women would construct hunting camps when the men were gone for extended periods of time. Women were also believed to serve as barbers, decorate homes, and produce decorative clothing. The Powhatan domestic economy depended on the labor of both sexes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsmith400.org/2TheChesapeakeBayRegionanditsPeoplein1607.pdf|title=\"The Chesapeake Bay Region and its People in 1607\"<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n\nThe native Powhatan religion has been well documented. The Powhatans believed in two primary Gods. Ahone was the creator and giver of good things. Oke was an evil spirit who gave bad things. Beneath these two were many other spirits. The Powhatan tried to appease Oke with various offerings such as jewelry and tobacco. Religious leaders were advisors to tribal leaders.<ref>https://www.historyisfun.org/learn/learning-center/how-did-the-powhatan-express-their-religious-beliefs/</ref> It is believed that Powhatans would make offerings and pray to the sun during sunrises.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Government==\n===Capitals===\n\nTsenacommacah originally had two capitals. The main capital was the village of [[Werowocomoco]], located in present-day Gloucester County. The second capital, the village of Powhatan was believed to be in the present-day Powhatan Hill section of the eastern part of [[Richmond, Virginia]], or perhaps nearby in a location which became part of Tree Hill Farm.\n\nWerowocomoco was described by the English colonists as only {{convert|15|mi|km}} as the crow flies from Jamestown, but also described as {{convert|25|mi|km}} downstream from present-day [[West Point, Virginia|West Point]], measurements which conflict with each other. In 2003 archaeologists initiated excavations at a site in Gloucester County that have revealed an extensive indigenous settlement from about 1200 (the late [[Woodland]] period) through the early Contact period. Work since then has added to their belief that this is the location of Werowocomoco. The site is on a farm bordering on Purtain Bay of the York River, about {{convert|12|nmi|km|sigfig=2}} from Jamestown. The more than {{convert|50|acre|m2|sigfig=2}} residential settlement extends up to {{convert|1000|ft|m|sigfig=1}} back from the river. In 2004, researchers excavated two curving ditches of {{convert|200|ft|m|sigfig=1}} at the far edge, which were constructed about 1400 CE. In addition to extensive artifacts from hundreds of years of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] settlement, researchers have found a variety of trade goods related to the brief interaction of Native Americans and English in the early years of Jamestown.\n\nAround 1609, Wahunsenacawh shifted his capital from Werowocomoco to ''[[Orapakes]]'', located in a swamp at the head of the [[Chickahominy River]], near the modern-day interchange of [[Interstate 64]] and [[Interstate 295 (Virginia)|Interstate 295]]. Sometime between 1611 and 1614, he moved further north to ''[[Matchut]]'', in present-day [[King William County, Virginia|King William County]] on the north bank of the [[Pamunkey River]].\n\n===Leadership===\n\nEach tribe had its own name and chief (''werowance''/''weroance'' or ''weroansqua'' if female), and Tsenacommacah as a whole was ruled by a paramount chief (''mamanatowick'') named Wahunsenacawh, or more popularly [[Chief Powhatan]].<ref name=autogenerated1 >Rountree, Helen C. Pocahontas, Powhatan, Opechancanough: Three Indian Lives Changed by Jamestown. University of Virginia Press, 2005.</ref>\n\nThe Mamanatowick let their district and subordinate weroances make the final decision on how to handle hostile situations. This was made apparent with the events that took place in 1607 and the hostility with the newcomers (English settlers). Weroances and Priest were the only ones allowed to enter into religious temples. A weroance did not go to meet any visitor, visitors were escorted to see a weroance. The weroance, their wives, and councilors often dressed in the finest jewels, and tanned deer skin.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rountree|first1=Helen C.|title=Pocahontas, Powhatan, Opechancanough : three Indian lives changed by Jamestown|date=2005|publisher=University of Virginia press|location=Charlottesville (Va.)|isbn=0-8139-2323-9|page=Chapter 2}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of the weroances' personal names were known and some recorded by [[William Strachey]] and other sources.<ref>[http://www.mariner.org/chesapeakebay/native/nam031.html List of weroances recorded by Strachey]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509192841/http://www.mariner.org/chesapeakebay/native/nam031.html |date=May 9, 2008 }}</ref> The names of their respective chieftaincies were also commonly used as titles, exactly analogous to European peerages, so that the Weroance of Arrohattec (whose given name was Ashaquid) was often referred to simply as \"Arrohattec\", much as the Earl of Essex would be referred to just as \"Essex\" in lieu of a personal name.\n\nWhen the English arrived in Virginia, some of the weroances subject to the paramount chief Powhatan, or ''mamanatowick'' (Wahunsenacawh) were his own nearest male relatives:\n\n* Parahunt, Weroance of the Powhatan (proper), also called ''Tanx'' (\"little\") Powhatan, said by Strachey to be a son of the paramount chief Powhatan, and often confused with same.\n* Pochins, Weroance of the [[Kecoughtan]], was also a son of the paramount chief, whom he had appointed there some time after slaying their previous ruler in ca. 1598.  \n*[[Opechancanough]], Chief Powhatan's younger brother, was a weroance of the [[Pamunkey]], but increased in power, and came to be the effective ruler of the entire Powhatan Confederacy after [[Wahunsenacawh]]'s death in 1618.\n\nIn Tsenacommacah, women could inherit power, because the inheritance of power was [[matrilineal]]. In ''A Map of Virginia'' [[John Smith of Jamestown]] explains:<blockquote>His <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Chief Powhatan]]'s] kingdome descendeth not to his sonnes nor children: but first to his brethren, whereof he hath 3 namely [[Opitchapan]], [[Opechancanough]], and [[Catataugh]]; and after their decease to his sisters. First to the eldest sister, then to the rest: and after them to the heires male and female of the eldest sister; but never to the heires of the males.<ref>Smith, John. ''A Map of Virginia.''

The album's [[lead single]], \"[[Don't Come Around Here No More]]\", co-written by [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] of [[Eurythmics]], peaked at #13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song \"Southern Accents\" was later covered by [[Johnny Cash]] for his ''[[Unchained (Johnny Cash album)|Unchained]]'' album in 1996.\n\n==Background==\n\nOriginally conceived as a concept album, the theme of \"Southern Accents\" became somewhat murky with the inclusion of three songs co-written by Stewart, and several others originally planned for the album left off. Songs cut from the track list include \"Trailer,\" \"Big Boss Man,\" \"Crackin' Up\" (a [[Nick Lowe]] cover), \"The Image of Me,\" \"Walkin' From the Fire\" and \"The Apartment Song.\" The first four (and a demo version of \"The Apartment Song\") were later released on ''[[Playback (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers box set)|Playback]],'' a box set that included familiar songs, outtakes, b-sides and other rarities. A studio version of \"The Apartment Song\" appeared on Petty's first solo album, ''[[Full Moon Fever]]'', released in 1989. \"Trailer\" was later re-recorded and released in May 2016 by Petty's other band [[Mudcrutch]], on its second studio album, ''2''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/2-mw0002938002|title=2 - Mudcrutch - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|publisher=}}</ref> \"Walkin' From the Fire\" was eventually released on the posthumous box set ''[[An American Treasure]]'' in 2018. The song \"My Life/Your World\" from ''[[Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)]]'' included several of the song's lyrics rewritten.\n\nWhile mixing the album's opening track, \"Rebels,\" Petty became frustrated and punched a wall, severely breaking his left hand. Subsequent surgery on his hand left him with several pins, wires and screws holding his hand together.\n\nThe album cover features an 1865 painting by [[Winslow Homer]] titled ''The Veteran in a New Field''.\n\nA new version of the song \"The Best of Everything\" with a different arrangement and a previously unreleased verse was released as a single in 2018, before the release of the upcoming eponymous compilation album.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nIn a three-out-of-five star review, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of ''[[AllMusic]]'' commented that while \"occasionally, the songs work\" and \"[[Don't Come Around Here No More]]\" and \"[[Make It Better (Forget About Me)]]\" expand [the band's] sound nicely\", the record was too often \" weighed down by its own ambitions\".<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Southern Accents - Tom Petty and the Hearbreakers - AllMusic Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/southern-accents-mw0000650626 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=8 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing   = [[Tom Petty]], except where noted\n| headline = Side one\n| title1     = [[Rebels (song)|Rebels]]\n| length1 = 5:21\n| title2     = It Ain't Nothin' to Me\n| writer2    = Tom Petty, [[David A.

The album's [[lead single]], \"[[Don't Come Around Here No More]]\", co-written by [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] of [[Eurythmics]], peaked at #13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Its music video featured ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' imagery. The song \"Southern Accents\" was later covered by [[Johnny Cash]] for his ''[[Unchained (Johnny Cash album)|Unchained]]'' album in 1996.\n\n==Background==\n\nOriginally conceived as a concept album, the theme of \"Southern Accents\" became somewhat murky with the inclusion of three songs co-written by Stewart, and several others originally planned for the album left off. Songs cut from the track list include \"Trailer,\" \"Big Boss Man,\" \"Crackin' Up\" (a [[Nick Lowe]] cover), \"The Image of Me,\" \"Walkin' From the Fire\" and \"The Apartment Song.\" The first four (and a demo version of \"The Apartment Song\") were later released on ''[[Playback (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers box set)|Playback]],'' a box set that included familiar songs, outtakes, b-sides and other rarities. A studio version of \"The Apartment Song\" appeared on Petty's first solo album, ''[[Full Moon Fever]]'', released in 1989. \"Trailer\" was later re-recorded and released in May 2016 by Petty's other band [[Mudcrutch]], on its second studio album, ''2''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/2-mw0002938002|title=2 - Mudcrutch - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|publisher=}}</ref> \"Walkin' From the Fire\" was eventually released on the posthumous box set ''[[An American Treasure]]'' in 2018. The song \"My Life/Your World\" from ''[[Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)]]'' included several of the song's lyrics rewritten.\n\nWhile mixing the album's opening track, \"Rebels,\" Petty became frustrated and punched a wall, severely breaking his left hand. Subsequent surgery on his hand left him with several pins, wires and screws holding his hand together.\n\nThe album cover features an 1865 painting by [[Winslow Homer]] titled ''The Veteran in a New Field''.\n\nA new version of the song \"The Best of Everything\" with a different arrangement and a previously unreleased verse was released as a single in 2018, before the release of the upcoming eponymous compilation album.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nIn a three-out-of-five star review, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of ''[[AllMusic]]'' commented that while \"occasionally, the songs work\" and \"[[Don't Come Around Here No More]]\" and \"[[Make It Better (Forget About Me)]]\" expand [the band's] sound nicely\", the record was too often \" weighed down by its own ambitions\".<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Southern Accents - Tom Petty and the Hearbreakers - AllMusic Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/southern-accents-mw0000650626 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=8 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing   = [[Tom Petty]], except where noted\n| headline = Side one\n| title1     = [[Rebels (song)|Rebels]]\n| length1 = 5:21\n| title2     = It Ain't Nothin' to Me\n| writer2    = Tom Petty, [[David A.

[[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 de Haerne|Monsignor de Haerne]], an influential Belgian priest and senator founded the School at a small house in [[Handsworth, South Yorkshire|Handsworth]] in 1870 with the help from the [[Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul]]. The School was relocated to [[Boston Spa]] in 1875. With efforts from the Daughters of Charity, the School has had a [[Vincentian Family]] ethos for almost a century and a half. The School will celebrate its 150th anniversary in 2020.\n\nSt John's Catholic School for the Deaf is referred to as \"Boston Spa\" in [[British Sign Language]]. Many past pupils are leaders, educators, teachers and businessmen in the Deaf Community. Lara Crooks, a past pupil, was a regular presenter for [[See Hear]], a TV programme for deaf and hard of hearing people in the United Kingdom. [[Gerry Hughes (sailor)|Gerry Hughes]], the round the world yachtsman was also a pupil.<ref>[http://www.gerrysmhughes.com/Gerrys_Life-i-426.html Gerrys Life]. gerrysmhughes.com</ref><ref name=\"Taylor2007\">{{cite book|author=Joselyn Taylor|title=Boston Spa: The Story of St. John's Catholic School for Deaf Children, 1875 \u2013 1975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OrXOMgEACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=British Deaf History Society Publications|isbn=978-1-902427-28-7}}</ref>\n\nSt John's School provides a day and boarding education for deaf and hard of hearing children and young people. In the primary department, teachers use the [[Maternal Reflective Method]] of English language teaching, pioneered by Father van Uden, a Dutch oralist based at the Institution for the Deaf in [[Sint-Michielsgestel|Sint Michielsgestel]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.stjohns.org.uk/primary_department/maternal-reflection-method.aspx|title=Maternal Reflective Method|work=St John's Catholic School for the Deaf|accessdate=24 April 2009}}</ref> In the Post-16 section, young people are provided with note-takers to support them when they attend local colleges, in particular [[York College (York)|York College]] and [[Askham Bryan College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohns.org.uk/post_16_department/|title=Post-16 department|work=St John's Catholic School for the Deaf|accessdate=24 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe School was subject to controversy in 2008, when compensation was awarded to seven men who were victims of a [[paedophile priest]] employed at the school between 1975 and 1980.\n\n[[Gabby Logan]] (the school's patron) presented a [[BBC]] [[Radio 4 Appeal]] on Easter Sunday 2009 to raise funds for an Expressive Arts Resource (EAR). The new drama studio was officially opened in October 2012 by Monsignor John Wilson of the Diocese of Leeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jlwnz|title=BBC Radio 4 Appeal|accessdate=23 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Nickname==\n\nWhile the School's official name is St John's Catholic School for the Deaf, it is referred to by the past pupils and the deaf community as \"Boston Spa\", the village where the School is situated, and as it is easier to lipread.\n\n==Belgian Sign Language ==\n\nBoston Spa was the only school in England that used a sign language other than [[British Sign Language]], namely [[Belgian Sign Language]] introduced from Brussels by the two Daughters of Charity. St Vincent's School for the Deaf (Tollcross) in [[Glasgow]] previously used [[Irish Sign Language]].\n\n==Language policy==\n\nIn the early days,{{when|date=November 2013}} Boston Spa used [[Belgian Sign Language]] which was imported from [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 de Haerne|de Haerne]]'s school in [[Brussels]]. After the Second World War, it was decided to introduce [[oralism]] through the demands of parents. A St Vincent's Unit was set up half a mile away from the main school to cater for children who could not cope in the main school. St Vincent's Unit eventually adopted [[Signed English]], using [[British Sign Language]]. The School has adopted [[van Uden]]'s Maternal Reflective Method, which promotes Spoken English using written texts.\n\n==The Chapel==\n\nThe barrel-vaulted chapel, opened on 30 October 1889, was designed in a late [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and early [[Elizabethan]] styles, by Charles Hadfield.

[[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 de Haerne|Monsignor de Haerne]], an influential Belgian priest and senator founded the School at a small house in [[Handsworth, South Yorkshire|Handsworth]] in 1870 with the help from the [[Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul]]. The School was relocated to [[Boston Spa]] in 1875. With efforts from the Daughters of Charity, the School has had a [[Vincentian Family]] ethos for almost a century and a half. The School will celebrate its 150th anniversary in 2020.\n\nSt John's Catholic School for the Deaf is referred to as \"Boston Spa\" in [[British Sign Language]]. Many past pupils are leaders, educators, teachers and businessmen in the Deaf Community. Lara Crooks, a past pupil, was a regular presenter for [[See Hear]], a TV programme for deaf and hard of hearing people in the United Kingdom. [[Gerry Hughes (sailor)|Gerry Hughes]], the round the world yachtsman was also a pupil.<ref>[http://www.gerrysmhughes.com/Gerrys_Life-i-426.html Gerrys Life]. gerrysmhughes.com</ref><ref name=\"Taylor2007\">{{cite book|author=Joselyn Taylor|title=Boston Spa: The Story of St. John's Catholic School for Deaf Children, 1875 \u2013 1975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OrXOMgEACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=British Deaf History Society Publications|isbn=978-1-902427-28-7}}</ref>\n\nSt John's School provides a day and boarding education for deaf and hard of hearing children and young people. In the primary department, teachers use the [[Maternal Reflective Method]] of English language teaching, pioneered by Father van Uden, a Dutch oralist based at the Institution for the Deaf in [[Sint-Michielsgestel|Sint Michielsgestel]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.stjohns.org.uk/primary_department/maternal-reflection-method.aspx|title=Maternal Reflective Method|work=St John's Catholic School for the Deaf|accessdate=24 April 2009}}</ref> In the Post-16 section, young people are provided with note-takers to support them when they attend local colleges, in particular [[York College (York)|York College]] and [[Askham Bryan College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohns.org.uk/post_16_department/|title=Post-16 department|work=St John's Catholic School for the Deaf|accessdate=24 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe School was subject to controversy in 2008, when compensation was awarded to seven men who were victims of a [[paedophile priest]] employed at the school between 1975 and 1980.\n\n[[Gabby Logan]] (the school's patron) presented a [[BBC]] [[Radio 4 Appeal]] on Easter Sunday 2009 to raise funds for an Expressive Arts Resource (EAR). The new drama studio was officially opened in October 2012 by Monsignor John Wilson of the Diocese of Leeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jlwnz|title=BBC Radio 4 Appeal|accessdate=23 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Nickname==\n\nWhile the School's official name is St John's Catholic School for the Deaf, it is referred to by the past pupils and the deaf community as \"Boston Spa\", the village where the School is situated, and as it is easier to lipread.\n\n==Belgian Sign Language ==\n\nBoston Spa was the only school in England that used a sign language other than [[British Sign Language]], namely [[Belgian Sign Language]] introduced from Brussels by the two Daughters of Charity. St Vincent's School for the Deaf (Tollcross) in [[Glasgow]] previously used [[Irish Sign Language]].\n\n==Language policy==\n\nIn the early days,{{when|date=November 2013}} Boston Spa used [[Belgian Sign Language]] which was imported from [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 de Haerne|de Haerne]]'s school in [[Brussels]]. After the Second World War, it was decided to introduce [[oralism]] through the demands of parents. A St Vincent's Unit was set up half a mile away from the main school to cater for children who could not cope in the main school. St Vincent's Unit eventually adopted [[Signed English]], using [[British Sign Language]]. The School has adopted [[van Uden]]'s Maternal Reflective Method, which promotes Spoken English using written texts.\n\n==The Chapel==\n\nThe barrel-vaulted chapel, opened on 30 October 1889, was designed in a late [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and early [[Elizabethan]] styles, by Charles Hadfield. Hadfield's father was Matthew E. Hadfield who was the Secretary to the School in its early years.
