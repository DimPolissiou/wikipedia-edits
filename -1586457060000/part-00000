Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the north-west coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century CE at the latest. The considerable amount of [[Wattle and daub|daub]] found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site. There is evidence for limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century. The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicate a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture. The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period.<ref>Kusimba, Chapurukha, and Walz, Jonathan.

(2015), and to the Resurgence in Maritime Myopia in the Archaeology of the East African Coast\", American Anthropologist 120(3).</ref> Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the central Swahili trading towns.<ref>Horton, Mark and Middleton, Tom. \"The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Community.\" (Oxford: Blackwell, 2010), 46.</ref>\n\nExcavations at nearby Pemba Island, but especially at Shanga in the Lamu Archipelago, provide the clearest picture of architectural development. Houses were originally built with timber (c. 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (c. 1150). The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials. By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone. Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries. According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture. While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century.<ref>Horton, Mark and Middleton, John. \"The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Community.\" (Oxford: Blackwell, 2010), 119.</ref>\n\nPersian, Indian, and Arab traders used Zanzibar as a base for voyages between the Middle East, India, and Africa. Unguja, the larger island, offered a protected and defensible harbor, so although the archipelago offered few products of value, traders settled at [[Zanzibar City]] (\"[[Stone Town]]\") a convenient point from which to trade with the other [[Swahili coast]] towns.\n\nThe impact of these traders and immigrants on the [[Swahili culture]] is uncertain. During the [[Middle Ages]], Zanzibar and other settlements on the Swahili Coast were advanced. The littoral contained a number of autonomous trade cities. These towns grew in wealth as the [[Swahili people]] served as intermediaries and facilitators to local, inland mainland African, Arab, Persian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Indian, and Chinese merchants and traders.<ref>Kusimba, Chapurukha. \"The Rise and Decline of Swahili States.\" (Walnut Creek, California: Altamira, 1999).</ref> This interaction contributed in part to the evolution of the [[Swahili culture]], which developed its own written language. Although a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]], the [[Swahili language]] as a consequence today includes some elements that were borrowed from other civilizations, particularly [[loanword]]s from [[Arabic]]. With the wealth that they had acquired through trade, some of the Arab traders also became rulers of the coastal cities.<ref>[http://endingstereotypes.org/african_history.html The Swahili, African History, ''Ending Stereotypes for America''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904200204/http://endingstereotypes.org/african_history.html |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Portuguese colonization===\n[[Vasco da Gama]]'s visit in 1498 marked the beginning of European influence.

The first English ship to visit Unguja, the ''Edward Bonaventure'' in 1591, found that there was no Portuguese fort or garrison.

The Portuguese presence was relatively limited, leaving administration in the hands of preexisting local leaders and power structures. This system lasted until 1631, when the Sultan of Mombasa massacred the Portuguese inhabitants. For the remainder of their rule, the Portuguese appointed European governors. The strangling of trade and diminished local power led the Swahili elites in Mombasa and Zanzibar to invite Omani aristocrats to assist them in driving the Europeans out.<ref name=\"Eliot\">Sir Charles Eliot, K.C.M.G., [https://archive.org/details/eastafricaprotec00eliouoft ''The East Africa Protectorate''], London: Edward Arnold, 1905, digitized by the Internet Archive in 2008 ([[PDF]] format).</ref>{{rp|page: 9}}\n\nIn 1698, Zanzibar came under the influence of the [[Oman|Sultanate of Oman]].<ref>N.

Over the next few years, however, almost all of these mainland possessions were lost to European imperial powers.\n\nThe sultans developed an economy of trade and [[cash crop]]s in the Zanzibar Archipelago with a ruling Arab elite. [[Ivory]] was a major trade good. The archipelago, sometimes referred to by locals as the Spice Islands, was famous worldwide for its cloves and other spices, and plantations were developed to grow them. The archipelago's commerce gradually fell into the hands of traders from the [[Indian subcontinent]], whom Said bin Sultan encouraged to settle on the islands.\n\nDuring his 14-year reign as sultan, Majid bin Said consolidated his power around the [[Arab slave trade]].

It is cheaper, simpler, less wounding to their self-esteem, gives them more career as public officials, and spares of unnecessary contact with white men.<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Salisbury: Victorian Titan'' (1999) p 529</ref>\n\nFrom 1890 to 1913, traditional [[viziers]] were in charge; they were supervised by advisors appointed by the Colonial Office.  However, in 1913 a switch was made to a system of direct rule through residents (effectively governors) from 1913.  The death of the pro-British [[Sultan]] [[Hamad bin Thuwaini]] on 25 August 1896 and the succession of Sultan [[Khalid bin Barghash of Zanzibar|Khalid bin Barghash]], whom the British did not approve of, led to the [[Anglo-Zanzibar War]]. On the morning of 27 August 1896, ships of the [[Royal Navy]] destroyed the Beit al Hukum Palace.

Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the north-west coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century CE at the latest. The considerable amount of [[Wattle and daub|daub]] found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site. There is evidence for limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century. The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicate a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture. The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period.<ref>Kusimba, Chapurukha, and Walz, Jonathan.

Houses were originally built with timber (c. 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (c. 1150). The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials. By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone. Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries. According to John Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture. While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century.<ref>Horton, Mark and Middleton, John. \"The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Community.\" (Oxford: Blackwell, 2010), 119.</ref>\n\nPersian, Indian, and Arab traders used Zanzibar as a base for voyages between the Middle East, India, and Africa. Unguja, the larger island, offered a protected and defensible harbor, so although the archipelago offered few products of value, traders settled at [[Zanzibar City]] (\"[[Stone Town]]\") a convenient point from which to trade with the other [[Swahili coast]] towns.\n\nThe impact of these traders and immigrants on the [[Swahili culture]] is uncertain. During the [[Middle Ages]], Zanzibar and other settlements on the Swahili Coast were advanced. The littoral contained a number of autonomous trade cities. These towns grew in wealth as the [[Swahili people]] served as intermediaries and facilitators to local, inland mainland African, Arab, Persian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Indian, and Chinese merchants and traders.<ref>Kusimba, Chapurukha. \"The Rise and Decline of Swahili States.\" (Walnut Creek, California: Altamira, 1999).</ref> This interaction contributed in part to the evolution of the [[Swahili culture]], which developed its own written language. Although a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]], the [[Swahili language]] as a consequence today includes some elements that were borrowed from other civilizations, particularly [[loanword]]s from [[Arabic]]. With the wealth that they had acquired through trade, some of the Arab traders also became rulers of the coastal cities.<ref>[http://endingstereotypes.org/african_history.html The Swahili, African History, ''Ending Stereotypes for America''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904200204/http://endingstereotypes.org/african_history.html |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Portuguese colonization===\n[[Vasco da Gama]]'s visit in 1498 marked the beginning of European influence.

The Portuguese presence was relatively limited, leaving administration in the hands of preexisting local leaders and power structures. This system lasted until 1631, when the Sultan of Mombasa massacred the Portuguese inhabitants. For the remainder of their rule, the Portuguese appointed European governors.

[[Ivory]] was a major trade good. The archipelago, sometimes referred to by locals as the Spice Islands, was famous worldwide for its cloves and other spices, and plantations were developed to grow them. The archipelago's commerce gradually fell into the hands of traders from the [[Indian subcontinent]], whom Said bin Sultan encouraged to settle on the islands.\n\nDuring his 14-year reign as sultan, Majid bin Said consolidated his power around the [[Arab slave trade]].

Born in [[Clifton, Bristol]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1894, and travelled to the [[Transvaal Colony]] where, as a member of [[Milner's Kindergarten]], he became Director of Education. Ware next became editor of the [[The Morning Post|''Morning Post'']], being fired in 1911 after several controversies.\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] started in August 1914, Ware attempted to join the [[British Army]] but was rejected because he was too old.

In this role he began marking and recording the graves of those killed. Ware and his graves' registration organization were transferred to the [[British Army]] in 1915. This was to become the Imperial War Graves Commission. Ware ended the war as a major general, having been [[mentioned in despatches]] twice and continued to work with the commission.

Born in [[Clifton, Bristol]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1894, and travelled to the [[Transvaal Colony]] where, as a member of [[Milner's Kindergarten]], he became Director of Education. Ware next became editor of the [[The Morning Post|''Morning Post'']], being fired in 1911 after several controversies.\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] started in August 1914, Ware attempted to join the [[British Army]] but was rejected because he was too old. With the assistance of [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], he obtained command of a mobile [[ambulance]] unit provided by the [[British Red Cross Society]]. In this role he began marking and recording the graves of those killed. Ware and his graves' registration organization were transferred to the [[British Army]] in 1915. This was to become the Imperial War Graves Commission. Ware ended the war as a major general, having been [[mentioned in despatches]] twice and continued to work with the commission. In [[World War II]], he was appointed director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries.

That spring he began serving as an intermediary between the French and British governments over grave-related matters. The organization began handling requests at a headquarters in [[Lillers]], and the sections worked on grave maintenance. The organization was soon exempted from a ban on [[War photography|photography]] and a department of three photographers was created to photograph graves; by mid-August, six thousand graves had been photographed and eight hundred photographs sent to families. A further 18,173 graves had been registered. Around the same time Ware became unable to continue work with the Mobile Ambulance Unit, and began to solely focus on the commission. On 6 September Macready recommended transferring the organization completely to the Army; the transfer was completed by late October.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=50\u201352, 54\u201356, 59}}  \n\nIn his role in the commission, wares served as \"the sole [[intermediary]] between the British Army in the Field and the French Military and Civil Authorities in all matters relating to graves.\"{{Sfn|War Graves|1929|p=15}} Throughout 1915 and 1916, Ware led negotiations between France and Britain, resolving various issues, particularly that of [[land expropriation]]. Around June 1915, his efforts resulted in an 'expropriation bill' that began to be debated by the French government. Ware shepherded the bill through its passage, urging prominent figures such as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], the [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant-General]], the [[King of the United Kingdom|King]], and the editor of the ''Times'' to support it.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=59, 64}} The law passed the French government on 29 December 1917.{{Sfn|NYS Assembly|1918|p=548}} It gave Britain the ability to control their war graves in \"perpetuity of [[sepulture]]\"{{Sfn|Miles|2017|p=51}} and provided for the establishment of a British authority to manage the cemeteries.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=65}} \n\nWhen [[William Glynne Charles Gladstone]], a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] and the grandson of former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], was [[killed in action]] near [[Laventie]] on 13 April 1915, his family attempted to have the body [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and returned to England.

For example, [[Lionel Earle]], a member of the International War Graves Committee, objected to the Army's practice of marking the graves of [[deserters]] with unmarked wooden crosses. As a result the custom was abolished. In 1916, efforts to neaten the cemeteries began. Ware invited [[Arthur William Hill]], then assistant director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], to tour the cemeteries and advise upon further planting efforts in early 1915.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=88\u201389}} In the [[1917 New Year Honours]], Ware was awarded the [[Companion Order of St Michael and St George]].{{Sfn|The Edinburgh Gazette 26 January 1917}} \n\n=== Imperial War Graves Commission ===\n[[File:Canadian Corps - Canadian war graves.jpg|thumb|Canadian war graves near [[Ypres, Belgium]].

[[Hindus]], adherents of [[folk religions]] and [[Buddhists]] are expected to experience the greatest growth as a percentage of their modest 2010 counts, with each group more than doubling in size by 2050.\n==Judaism==\nFor over 2,000 years a large portion of world Jewry lived in the Middle East. They are colloquially known as [[Mizrahi Jews]]. They include descendants of Babylonian Jews and Mountain Jews from modern Iraq, Morocco, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Syria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran, Uzbekistan, the Caucasus, Kurdistan, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Yemen. Since the 1950s because of growing antisemitism, most of these Jews fled to Israel where they make up the majority of Israel's Jewish population and roughly a third of total world Jewry. While they no longer live among a Muslim majority, they continue to follow many customs with strong Muslim and Middle Eastern influences making them distinct from European Jewry.\nToday [[Judaism]] in the Middle East is mostly practiced in Israel. Israel's population is 75.3% Jewish, with the remainder made up of Muslims (20.6%), [[Christians]], [[Druze]], [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] and various other minorities (4.1%).<ref>http://www1.cbs.gov.il/reader/?MIval=cw_usr_view_SHTML&ID=705</ref> There are few other countries in the Middle East with significant Jewish populations, but the communities are small and scattered.\n\n==Christianity==\n{{See also|Christianity in the Middle East}}\nChristianity [[Origins of Christianity|originated]] in the region in the 1st century AD, and was one of the major religions of the region until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the mid-to-late 7th century AD.

The [[eponym]]ously named Alawites revere [[Ali]] (Ali ibn Abi Talib), considered the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|1st Imam]] of the Twelver school. However, they are generally considered to be [[Ghulat]] by most other sects of Shia Islam. The sect is believed to have been founded by [[Ibn Nusayr]] during the 9th century, and fully established as a religion, For this reason, Alawites are sometimes called ''Nusayris'' ({{lang-ar|\u0646\u0635\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0629}} ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012byyah''), although the term has come to be used as a pejorative in the modern era. Another name, ''Ansari'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629}} ''An\u1e63\u0101riyyah''), is believed to be a mistransliteration of ''Nusayri''. Today, Alawites represent 11 percent of the [[Syrian people|Syrian]] population and are a significant minority in Turkey and northern Lebanon. There is also a population living in the village of [[Ghajar]] in the [[Golan Heights]]. They are often confused with the [[Alevi]]s of Turkey. Alawites form the dominant religious group on the Syrian coast and towns near the coast which is also inhabited by Sunnis, [[Christianity in Syria|Christians]], and [[Ismailis]].\n\nAlawites have historically kept their beliefs secret from outsiders and non-initiated Alawites.<ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:68>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.68</ref><ref name=YFNAIRHI2010:67>[[#YFNAIRHI2010|Friedman, ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012b-\u02bfAlaw\u012bs'', 2010]]: p.67</ref> At the core of Alawite belief is a divine triad, comprising three aspects of the one God.\n\nAlawites have traditionally lived in the [[An-Nusayriyah Mountains]] along the Mediterranean coast of Syria.

Many countries have now developed their branches. Many are violent and most Arab governments actively try to restrain the group by arresting and killing members. Currently, as the new government of Egypt is trying to establish itself, many are concerned that a member of the Muslim Brotherhood will again step in and claim leadership. For the current candidates for the presidency, more than one is likely to be affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThe Brotherhood is however unpopular among the majority of Egyptians on account of its fundamentalist views, its clampdown on tourism and its desire to impose [[Sharia]] law on the nation.\n\n===Iran===\n[[Religion in Iran]] is made up of 98% Islam (Shi'a 89%, Sunni 9%) and 2% Zoroastrian, Jewish, Christian, and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed.<ref name=Percents /> There was much religious oppression and executions of members of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith.

Israel represents the religious Holy Land for Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Baha'is. All religions are present in Israel and lay personal claim to the land. Due to the significant Israeli/Palestinian conflict, tensions are high in the religious community.

The [[eponym]]ously named Alawites revere [[Ali]] (Ali ibn Abi Talib), considered the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|1st Imam]] of the Twelver school. However, they are generally considered to be [[Ghulat]] by most other sects of Shia Islam. The sect is believed to have been founded by [[Ibn Nusayr]] during the 9th century, and fully established as a religion, For this reason, Alawites are sometimes called ''Nusayris'' ({{lang-ar|\u0646\u0635\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0629}} ''Nu\u1e63ayr\u012byyah''), although the term has come to be used as a pejorative in the modern era.

Today, Alawites represent 11 percent of the [[Syrian people|Syrian]] population and are a significant minority in Turkey and northern Lebanon. There is also a population living in the village of [[Ghajar]] in the [[Golan Heights]]. They are often confused with the [[Alevi]]s of Turkey.

Israel represents the religious Holy Land for Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Baha'is. All religions are present in Israel and lay personal claim to the land. Due to the significant Israeli/Palestinian conflict, tensions are high in the religious community.

There has been a growing religious resurgence in Turkey and more and more citizens find significance in their religious identities. The previous laws disallowing the [[Hijab]], religious headscarf, in schools and public places has been a huge source of contention. Now, it is a matter of civil rights in courts. The case of [[Sahin 2004]] was one that exemplified the tension between religious secularism, civil rights and the government's power in Turkey.<ref name=Turkey>{{cite book|last=Durham|first=Cole|title=Islam, Europe and Emerging Legal Issues|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate}}</ref> The case revolved around a student at university being allowed to wear the Hijab in class.<ref name=Turkey /> Religious education is also a topic of debate in Turkey. Before 1980, private religious education was banned and then it was changed to be required. As it is currently being reevaluated, the question is whether religious education should be banned again, optional or if it should be obligatory and plural.\n\n===Yemen===\n[[Religion in Yemen]] is represented by a majority of Islam (including Sunni and Shiite), small numbers of Jewish, Baha'i, Christian, and Hindu.<ref name=Percents />\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Middle Eastern mythology (disambiguation)|Middle Eastern mythology]]\n*[[Religions of the ancient Near East]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Religion in}}\n\n[[Category:Religion in the Middle East| ]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern culture]]\n", "name_user": "John B123", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eChristianity:Fixed cite error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Middle_East"}
