In his youth Taamrat attended the School of the [[Swedish Evangelical Mission]] in [[Italian Eritrea]]. At the age of 16 Taamrat met Dr. [[Jacques Faitlovitch]], him took him back with him to Paris to study. When Taamrat arrived in Paris he was sent in 1904 to a school for teachers of the ''[[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle|Alliance isra\u00e9lite universelle]]'' organization which was located in Paris. Four years later on, in 1908, when Taamrat was 20 years of age, he was sent by Dr. Faitlovitch to a Jewish Theological Seminary (Collegio Rabbinico Italiano) in [[Florence|Florence, Italy]] under the watchful eye of Rabbi Dr. [[Samuel Hirsch Margulies]] and Rabbi [[Tzvi-Peretz Hayot]]. In 1915 Taamrat graduated from the seminary thus becoming a Rabbi, [[Shochet]] (Kosher [[Butcher|slaughterer]]) and professor.

When they returned to Ethiopia Faitlovitch established a Jewish school aimed at training teachers while Taamrat was appointed as the Director of the school. One of his own initiatives included the translation of the ''Matzhaf Cadoussa'' (the scriptures of the [[Beta Israel]] community) from the [[Ge'ez]] language, which had ceased to be the community's spoken language, to the more widely used and common [[Amharic]] language.

Typically humid tropical and sub-tropical climates have reduced organic matter layers and horizons due to year round decomposition and high vegetation density and growth. In temperate and cold climates, litter tends to accumulate and decompose slower due to a shorter growing season.\n\n==Net primary productivity==\nNet [[primary production]] and litterfall are intimately connected.

In this way, litterfall becomes an important part of the nutrient cycle that sustains forest environments.\n\nAs litter decomposes, nutrients are released into the environment.  The portion of the litter that is not readily decomposable is known as [[humus]]. Litter aids in soil moisture retention by cooling the ground surface and holding moisture in decaying organic matter.

It was hosted by Eddie Ilarde, Bobby Ledesma, Leila Benitez, and Bobby de Veyra. The pioneer noontime show ended in 1965 when Ilarde went to politics. It was succeeded by several noontime shows until its comeback in 1975.\n\n=== ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s successors (1965\u20131975) ===\n''Magandang Tanghali'', a musical variety show hosted by [[Pancho Magalona]], and ''Stop Look and Listen'', a former noontime variety show hosted by [[Eddie Mesa]] took over Student Canteen's timeslot in 1965. After Eddie left for the US, ''Twelve O'Clock High'', a show hosted by [[Ariel Ureta]] and Tina Revilla-Valencia), premiered and aired until 1972 when [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] was declared. ABS-CBN and other TV stations were shut down by the Marcos regime. The show moved to RBS (now GMA Network) as ''Ariel con Tina'', a blocktimer by a company headed by Romy Jalosjos from 1972 to 1974. ''Lunch Break'' also gained ground on the same channel before ''Student Canteen'' was eventually revived.\n\n=== ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s revival and the birth of ''Eat Bulaga!'' (1975\u2013present) ===\n''Student Canteen'' was revived in 1975 by main host Eddie Ilarde, who produced the program under his production company Program Philippines, Inc. after accepting an offer from [[GMA Network]] executives. He was joined by Bobby Ledesma and Pepe Pimentel with new co-hosts Helen Vela and Coney Reyes.  \n\n''Student Canteen'' soon became the most-watched noontime program in the '70s and Program Philippines soon branched out to producing other TV shows also on GMA-7. The famous comic trio of [[Tito Sotto]], [[Vic Sotto]], and [[Joey de Leon]] (collectively known as TVJ) became pinch hitters on ''Student Canteen'' when some of the main hosts were on leave. ''Student Canteen'' is the only noontime variety show on Philippine television from 1975 to 1979. Production Specialists, Inc. offered TVJ to host a new noontime show for RPN in 1979. After some misunderstandings with the ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s main hosts, they decided to accept the offer and ''Eat Bulaga!'' aired its first episode on July 30, 1979. Tito, Vic, and Joey were accompanied by Richie D' Horsie and Chiqui Hollmann.\n\n==== Competition ====\nTwo-way competition between noontime shows started in 1979 when ''Eat Bulaga!'' (first aired in RPN 9) was pitted against ''Student Canteen'' (aired on GMA 7). Since then, ''Eat Bulaga!'' has faced several rivalries with other noontime shows through the years.\n\n===== ''Student Canteen'' (1979\u20131986) =====\n''Eat... Bulaga!'' struggled with its ratings due to lack of advertisers on its first year of airing due to ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s stronghold on television. ''EB'' was in danger of cancellation until \"Mr. Macho\" was launched in 1980, which made ''Bulaga'' surpass the ratings of its rival. ''Eat... Bulaga!'' was aired nationwide in 1982 with the launch of RPN's domestic satellite, which also coincided with Coney Reyes' transfer to ''EB'' and Chiqui Hollman to ''Student Canteen''. Other fresh faces were introduced in ''Student Canteen'' but the show was eventually canceled by the GMA management in March 1986, days after the People Power Revolution. ''Student Canteen'' was again revived in 1989, this time on RPN-9 but it was canceled again in 1990 after a misunderstanding occurred between the show's producers and the RPN management.\n\n===== ''[[Lunch Date]]'' (1986\u20131993) =====\n''Lunch Date'' became ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s successor in 1986 and was GMA Network's first station-produced noontime variety show. Its original hosts were Orly Mercado, Rico J. Puno, Toni Rose Gayda and Chiqui Hollmann. When the show was reformatted after a year, it only retained both Gayda and Hollman and brought in a mix of old and new faces to host the show, including Randy Santiago, Keno, Lito Pimentel, Tina Revilla, Pilita Corrales, Louie Heredia, Sheryl Cruz, Jon Santos, Dennis Padilla, Fe Delos Reyes, Manilyn Reynes, Willie Revillame and Ai Ai de las Alas. The show introduced new segments that will challenge ''EB''<nowiki/>'s reign in the noontime slot.\n\nIn 1987, \"Eat Bulaga\"'s ratings tilted in their favor when Aiza Seguerra, a Little Miss Philippines winner, joined the show and became an instant hit to viewers. In 1989, changes were in store for both noontime shows.  Former RPN-9 executive Wilma Galvante joined \"Lunch Date\" as overall-in-charge of the show.  Joining her was former \"Eat Bulaga\" writer Vincent Dy Buncio who became the show's director.  Meanwhile, ''Eat... Bulaga!'' moved to ABS-CBN due to RPN's sequestration under the Cory Aquino administration. ''Eat... Bulaga!'' (together with other new shows launched) helped ABS-CBN to attain its status as the No. 1 TV network from being No. 4. It also started the rivalry of GMA Network and ABS-CBN in the noontime slot that still exists until today. In 1993, GMA Network's management decided to reformat their own noontime show and replaced it by ''[[SST: Salo-Salo Together]]''. According to Joey de Leon, ''Lunch Date'' was their toughest opponent ever because it was pitted against ''EB'' for more than 6 years, the longest compared to other noontime shows.\n\n===== ''[[SST: Salo-Salo Together]]'' (1993\u20131995) =====\n''SST'' was first aired on March 20, 1993, as a replacement for ''[[Lunch Date]]'', hosted by [[Randy Santiago]], [[Dennis Padilla]], and Smokey Manaloto with [[Liezl Martinez]], Anjanette Abayari, Joy Ortega and Giselle Sanchez as co-hosts. In less than six months after it aired, SST started to take over ''[[Eat Bulaga!|Eat... Bulaga!]]'' in the ratings by providing fresh interactive segments. Comedians Ai-Ai delas Alas and Bayani Agbayani also became co-hosts of ''SST''.\n\nIt started as a [[blind item]] as 1994 was about to end until showbiz news had leaked out that ''SST'' was going to go off the air to give way to ''Eat... Bulaga!'' at the 12 pm slot, after ''EB'' itself had decided to move to GMA Network following their contract with ABS-CBN was bogged down. During ''SST''<nowiki/>'s New Year episode on December 31, 1994, the announcement of the new variety show's move to GMA was officially made by main hosts Randy Santiago and Dennis Padilla. The hosts and talents were sad because they felt the GMA Network management did not give them a chance to prove that they could carry the noontime show to new heights. But at the same time, they felt happy because the management decided to keep the show after they decided to move ''SST'' to an earlier time slot, as a pre-programming to ''Eat... Bulaga!''. SST made its last noontime episode on January 27, 1995. In June 1995, ''SST'' was permanently canceled.\n\n===== [['Sang Linggo nAPO Sila|''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila'']] (1995\u20131998) =====\nDue to ''Eat... Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s moved to rival GMA Network, ABS-CBN decided to make ''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' a weeklong noontime show as ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO SIla''. It aired its pilot episode on February 4, 1995 led by the famous APO Hiking Society, TVJ's former co-stars in ''OK Lang,'' a defunct TV show on IBC 13. During its first year, ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo'' was winning the ratings game in the provinces and cities where ABS-CBN have stronger signal. But the real challenge to the show was to deviate its content from the usual noontime variety show that ''Eat... Bulaga!'' presented to the viewers for almost two decades. Meanwhile, ''Bulaga'' had presented new faces like Allan K., Jose Manalo, and Donna Cruz, and new segments such as Super SiReyna and Philippine Bulaga Association. Calendar Girl was introduced by ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila'' in 1998 with John Estrada, Randy Santiago, and Willie Revillame handling the segment by delivering naughtier jokes on TV.\n\nThe rating for ''SLNS'' had improved but the main hosts did not sit well with the changes on their show. Eventually, ABS-CBN had ended again its own noontime show (due to criticisms that the show was too intelligent for an average Filipino) on November 28, 1998, with ''Magandang Tanghali Bayan'' taking place with its main hosts: Randy, John, and Willie.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|Magandang Tanghali Bayan]]'' (1998\u20132003) =====\nAfter the APO had failed to beat the continuing supremacy of ''EB'', the new triumvirate of Randy, John, and Willie was pitted to the established trio of Tito, Vic, and Joey as ABS-CBN launched its new noontime show on November 30, 1998, with the title ''Magandang Tanghali Bayan''. Its highlight segment, ''Pera O Bayong'', made ''MTB'' overtook ''Eat... Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s ratings for years. Due to the growing popularity of the show, ''EB'' gave its first millions on television through its new segments ''Meron O Wala'' and the all-time popular segment ''Laban O Bawi'' which featured the phenomenal all-female dance group ''Sexbomb Girls''. Meanwhile, ''MTB'' had faced numerous controversies and suspensions including the one-week suspension of the show in August 1999 due to the notorious green jokes of the main hosts. During that week, a placeholder show entitled ''Esep-Esep'' filled in the timeslot. In 2001, Willie Revillame was axed on the show which resulted in major changes in the set of new hosts and segments.\n\nAnother triumvirate was introduced on ''MTB'' when matinee idols Rico Yan, Dominic Ochoa, and Marvin Agustin joined the show after Willie's exit. Their inclusion resulted in the show bringing in a younger crowd and a more wholesome approach to noontime viewing. However, on March 29, 2002, Rico died during his Lenten vacation in Palawan and ''MTB'' later on reformatted on November 23, 2002, after it had lost its victory in terms of ratings to ''EB''.  The reformat, however, failed to stop the management in deciding to bring back Willie Revillame effective February 22, 2003, which lead to its second incarnation, ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan''.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|Masayang Tanghali Bayan]]'' (2003\u20132004) =====\n''Magandang Tanghali Bayan'' aired its last episode on February 21, 2003 and was replaced by ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'' as ABS-CBN's response to the noontime competition against ''Eat... Bulaga!''. The new MTB premiered on February 22, 2003 with Willie reunited with Randy Santiago and John Estrada together with other co-hosts Dennis Padilla, Ai-Ai delas Alas, Bayani Agbayani, Mickey Ferriols, Aubrey Miles, Tado, and Bentong. The show had given out more cash prizes than its predecessor through the segments ''Super Jack En Poy'' and ''Urong Sulong'', that gave away 2 million pesos as a jackpot prize.\n\nBefore the end of 2003, Willie Revillame resigned from the show in the midst of controversy regarding his derogatory joke against their co-host Mahal. The show continued to air until February 2004 with comedian Vhong Navarro and actor-host Edu Manzano taking over Willie's place. However, ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'' failed to sustain viewership and was given the axe on February 20, 2004, two days before their first anniversary on television.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|MTB: Ang Saya Saya]]'' (2004\u20132005) =====\nThe third incarnation of ''MTB'', entitled ''MTB: Ang Saya Saya'' premiered on February 21, 2004 with Ai-Ai delas Alas, Edu Manzano, and Arnell Ignacio as its main hosts. The show also introduced new set of co-hosts and segments, especially reality talent-based search segments. However, these efforts were overshadowed by the spectacular ''Silver Anniversary Special'' of ''Eat Bulaga!'' which got the all-time highest rating of a noontime show exceeding to 30%. On November 15, 2004, ''MTB: Ang Saya Saya'' lost its 12 pm slot to Kris Aquino's ''[[Pilipinas, Game KNB?]]'' and started airing as an afternoon variety show on a 1:00pm time slot as the network's strategic move against the anniversary special, but it had failed. After months of low ratings, the management decided to permanently cancelled the third incarnation of ''MTB'' on February 4, 2005 and launched a new noontime show under its new main host Willie Revillame.\n\n===== ''[[Wowowee]]'' (2005\u20132010) =====\nDue to public clamor, former ''MTB'' main host Willie Revillame made his comeback on the noontime slot with the new noontime show entitled ''Wowowee'' on February 5, 2005. ABS-CBN's strong reach in the Philippines and worldwide through TFC had helped ''Wowowee'' to lead the noontime race for years. Willie's novelty songs became popular because of ''Wowowee'' and it became an instant hit to the Filipino masses.\n\n''Wowowee'' also faced different controversies during its five-year run on television. The ULTRA Stampede, which happened during the first anniversary of the show, led to the death of 71 people. The [[Guinness World Records]] cited the incident as \"the greatest death toll in a game show.\" Another controversy was the Hello Papi Scandal, wherein Revillame allegedly cheated a contestant during the jackpot round on one of the ''Wowowee''<nowiki/>'s game segments. The scandal also led to a word war on-air between Willie and one of the ''EB''<nowiki/>'s main hosts Joey de Leon.\n\nThe competition became harder for ''Eat Bulaga!'' so they decided to have a different approach on celebrating their 30th anniversary in 2009 by honoring different people from different fields, giving scholarships to honor students, and constructing classrooms for public schools in different provinces. ''EB'' also renovated their studio to accommodate more studio audience, install LED screens, and to commemorate the first death anniversary of Francis Magalona on March 6, 2010. ''Eat Bulaga!'' also launched its widely popular segment ''Juan for All, All for Juan: Bayanihan of D' Pipol'' (a regular segment which broadcasts from different barangays).\n\nIn 2010, Revillame challenged ABS-CBN management to remove Jobert Sucaldito (radio/TV host), or he would resign from the noontime show due to Sucaldito's criticisms against Revillame and the show itself. On May 5, Revillame did not appear on ''Wowowee,'' and it became an indefinite leave. After negotiations between Revillame and the network, the network decided that ''Wowowee'' would air its final episode on July 30, 2010 (coinciding with ''Eat Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s 31st anniversary). The show was replaced by ''Pilipinas Win Na Win''. ''Wowowee'' became ABS-CBN's longest-running noontime show. Revillame is currently on GMA Network, hosting ''Wowowin'', a primetime variety game show with the same format with ''Wowowee''.\n\n===== ''[[Pilipinas Win Na Win]]'' (2010) =====\nAfter the cancellation of ''Wowowee'', ''Pilipinas Win Na Win'' premiered on July 31, 2010 with Kris Aquino and Robin Padilla as its main hosts, together with other co-hosts from ''Wowowee''. Some of the shows staff left the show to join Willie's comeback on TV5 In 2010. Suffering a plague of low ratings since launch, ABS-CBN asked Aquino mid-September for her to leave the show, and so she quietly left the show without any goodbyes on September 2010. Two days later on October 2, ABS-CBN officially announced four new hosts and two new co-hosts. The four hosts tagged as the \"hitmakers\" include [[Rico J. Puno]], [[Rey Valera]], [[Marco Sison]], and [[Nonoy Zuniga]].\n\nAfter a battle of constant low ratings and many alternate time slots, ''Pilipinas Win Na Win'' ended on December 31, 2010 during the New Year celebration. The cancellation was announced by [[Rico J. Puno]] several times during the December 20 episode. Rumors of this issue were around entertainment websites from interviews of a fellow co-host, [[Valerie Concepcion]] before the network announced its cancellation. Its time slot was temporarily occupied by [[Showtime (Philippines)|''Showtime'']]. On February 12, 2011, a new noontime show was aired entitled ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]''. The show was ABS-CBN's shortest-lived noontime show.\n\n===== ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]'' (2011\u20132012) =====\nThe unsuccessful stint of ''PWNW'' was immediately replaced by ''Happy Yipee Yehey!'' which premiered on February 12, 2011. Before its premiere, Willie Revillame (then-host of ''Willing Willie'' on TV5) challenged its upcoming host John Estrada that ''HYY'' would not reach its success in terms of ratings and Revillame will promote ''Eat Bulaga!'' constantly on his show. ''HYY'' was hosted by former ''MTB'' hosts John Estrada and Randy Santiago, Toni Gonzaga, Rico J. Puno, Pokwang, and others. The new noontime show introduced segments similar to its predecessors like ''Pera O Bayong'', ''My Girl'' and ''Miss Kasamabahay''.\n\nRevillame's prediction was correct. ''HYY'' received consistently low ratings due to ''Eat Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s strong noontime viewership. In January 2012, ''Showtime'' was cancelled from its late morning slot, and it was later revealed that ''Showtime'' would be formatted into a new noontime variety show to replace ''HYY''. ''Happy Yipee Yehey!'' aired its final episode on February 4, 2012 to give way to ABS-CBN's new noontime show, ''It's Showtime''.\n\n===== [[It's Showtime (TV program)|''It's Showtime'']] (2009\u2013present) =====\n''Showtime'', a morning talent show that existed since October 24, 2009 as a lead-in program to ''Wowowee'', was a big hit among the viewers that it even eclipsed the ratings of both ''Wowowee'' and ''Eat Bulaga''. The show tested the noontime waters in January 2011 as a temporary replacement for ''Pilipinas Win na Win'' before going back to the morning slot in February 2011 to give way to ''Happy Yipee Yehey.''  \n\nThe solid performance of ''Showtime'' as the top morning variety show prompted ABS-CBN management to transfer it to the noontime slot as ''It's Showtime'' on February 6, 2012. The new noontime show introduced segments from the ''Showtime'' series and new segments like ''Sine Mo 'To'', ''AdVice Ganda'', ''That's My Tomboy'', ''I Am PoGay'', and ''Magpasikat''. The show is currently hosted by Vice Ganda, Anne Curtis, Vhong Navarro, Jhong Hilario, Karylle, Ryan Bang, Mariel Rodriguez, Amy Perez, Jugs and Teddy. Currently, they feature the segments Tawag ng Tanghalan and Ms. Q&A. All of these segments were hits and caused them to fare well with ''Eat Bulaga'' in the ratings game since 2016, with EB leading in NUTAM and IS leading in KANTAR.\n\n== Sunday noontime shows ==\nCurrently, ABS-CBN's ''ASAP'' now holds the record of being the longest-running Sunday noontime variety show which was first aired in 1995 when ''Eat Bulaga!'' moved to GMA Network and the Sunday noontime show ''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' became a weeklong noontime show. During its 22nd anniversary, ''ASAP'' already surpassed the record of ''[[GMA Supershow]]'' as the longest-running Sunday noontime variety show.\n\nIts current rival program is ''All-Out Sundays'' aired on GMA Network. ''AOS'' aired its pilot episode in January 2020 as a replacement to ''Sunday PinaSaya''.\n\nOther popular defunct Sunday noontime variety shows are the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n![[GMA Network]]\n![[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]]\n|-\n|''[[GMA Supershow]]'' (May 7, 1978 - January 26, 1997)\n[[SOP (TV program)|''SOP'']] (February 2, 1997 - February 28, 2010)\n\n''[[Party Pilipinas]]'' (March 28, 2010 - May 19, 2013)\n\n''[[Sunday All Stars]]'' (June 16, 2013 - August 2, 2015)\n\n''[[Sunday PinaSaya]]'' (August 9, 2015 \u2013 December 29, 2019)\n\n'''[[All-Out Sundays|''All-Out Sundays'']] (January 5, 2020 \u2013 present)'''\n|''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' (January 28, 1990 - January 29, 1995)\n'''[[ASAP (TV program)|''ASAP'']] (February 5, 1995 \u2013 present)'''\n|-\n![[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|''[[P.O.5]]'' (April 11, 2010 - February 20, 2011)\n''[[Fan*tastik]]'' (February 27 - May 22, 2011)\n\n[[Sunday Funday (variety show)|''Sunday Funday'']] (April 8 - June 10, 2012)\n\n''[[Game 'N Go]]'' (June 17, 2012 - February 3, 2013)\n\n''[[Happy Truck ng Bayan]]'' (June 14, 2015 - February 7, 2016)\n\n''[[Happy Truck HAPPinas]]'' (March 6 - May 1, 2016) \n|}\n\n\n== List of weeklong noontime variety shows aired from 1958-present ==\n{| style=\"border: 1px solid darkgray; background: #CFECEC\"\n|Series shaded in light blue are currently in production.\n|}\nLength of current noontime shows are as of February 6, 2018.

It was hosted by Eddie Ilarde, Bobby Ledesma, Leila Benitez, and Bobby de Veyra. The pioneer noontime show ended in 1965 when Ilarde went to politics. It was succeeded by several noontime shows until its comeback in 1975.\n\n=== ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s successors (1965\u20131975) ===\n''Magandang Tanghali'', a musical variety show hosted by [[Pancho Magalona]], and ''Stop Look and Listen'', a former noontime variety show hosted by [[Eddie Mesa]] took over Student Canteen's timeslot in 1965. After Eddie left for the US, ''Twelve O'Clock High'', a show hosted by [[Ariel Ureta]] and Tina Revilla-Valencia), premiered and aired until 1972 when [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] was declared. ABS-CBN and other TV stations were shut down by the Marcos regime. The show moved to RBS (now GMA Network) as ''Ariel con Tina'', a blocktimer by a company headed by Romy Jalosjos from 1972 to 1974. ''Lunch Break'' also gained ground on the same channel before ''Student Canteen'' was eventually revived.\n\n=== ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s revival and the birth of ''Eat Bulaga!'' (1975\u2013present) ===\n''Student Canteen'' was revived in 1975 by main host Eddie Ilarde, who produced the program under his production company Program Philippines, Inc. after accepting an offer from [[GMA Network]] executives. He was joined by Bobby Ledesma and Pepe Pimentel with new co-hosts Helen Vela and Coney Reyes.  \n\n''Student Canteen'' soon became the most-watched noontime program in the '70s and Program Philippines soon branched out to producing other TV shows also on GMA-7.  The famous comic trio of [[Tito Sotto]], [[Vic Sotto]], and [[Joey de Leon]] (collectively known as TVJ) became pinch hitters on ''Student Canteen'' when some of the main hosts were on leave. ''Student Canteen'' is the only noontime variety show on Philippine television from 1975 to 1979. Production Specialists, Inc. offered TVJ to host a new noontime show for RPN in 1979. After some misunderstandings with the ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s main hosts, they decided to accept the offer and ''Eat Bulaga!'' aired its first episode on July 30, 1979. Tito, Vic, and Joey were accompanied by Richie D' Horsie and Chiqui Hollmann.\n\n==== Competition ====\nTwo-way competition between noontime shows started in 1979 when ''Eat Bulaga!'' (first aired in RPN 9) was pitted against ''Student Canteen'' (aired on GMA 7). Since then, ''Eat Bulaga!'' has faced several rivalries with other noontime shows through the years.\n\n===== ''Student Canteen'' (1979\u20131986) =====\n''Eat... Bulaga!'' struggled with its ratings due to lack of advertisers on its first year of airing due to ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s stronghold on television. ''EB'' was in danger of cancellation until \"Mr. Macho\" was launched in 1980, which made ''Bulaga'' surpass the ratings of its rival. ''Eat... Bulaga!'' was aired nationwide in 1982 with the launch of RPN's domestic satellite, which also coincided with Coney Reyes' transfer to ''EB'' and Chiqui Hollman to ''Student Canteen''. Other fresh faces were introduced in ''Student Canteen'' but the show was eventually canceled by the GMA management in March 1986, days after the People Power Revolution. ''Student Canteen'' was again revived in 1989, this time on RPN-9 but it was canceled again in 1990 after a misunderstanding occurred between the show's producers and the RPN management.\n\n===== ''[[Lunch Date]]'' (1986\u20131993) =====\n''Lunch Date'' became ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s successor in 1986 and was GMA Network's first station-produced noontime variety show. Its original hosts were Orly Mercado, Rico J. Puno, Toni Rose Gayda and Chiqui Hollmann. When the show was reformatted after a year, it only retained both Gayda and Hollman and brought in a mix of old and new faces to host the show, including Randy Santiago, Keno, Lito Pimentel, Tina Revilla, Pilita Corrales, Louie Heredia, Sheryl Cruz, Jon Santos, Dennis Padilla, Fe Delos Reyes, Manilyn Reynes, Willie Revillame and Ai Ai de las Alas. The show introduced new segments that will challenge ''EB''<nowiki/>'s reign in the noontime slot.\n\nIn 1987, \"Eat Bulaga\"'s ratings tilted in their favor when Aiza Seguerra, a Little Miss Philippines winner, joined the show and became an instant hit to viewers. In 1989, changes were in store for both noontime shows.  Former RPN-9 executive Wilma Galvante joined \"Lunch Date\" as overall-in-charge of the show.  Joining her was former \"Eat Bulaga\" writer Vincent Dy Buncio who became the show's director.  Meanwhile, ''Eat... Bulaga!'' moved to ABS-CBN due to RPN's sequestration under the Cory Aquino administration. ''Eat... Bulaga!'' (together with other new shows launched) helped ABS-CBN to attain its status as the No. 1 TV network from being No. 4. It also started the rivalry of GMA Network and ABS-CBN in the noontime slot that still exists until today. In 1993, GMA Network's management decided to reformat their own noontime show and replaced it by ''[[SST: Salo-Salo Together]]''. According to Joey de Leon, ''Lunch Date'' was their toughest opponent ever because it was pitted against ''EB'' for more than 6 years, the longest compared to other noontime shows.\n\n===== ''[[SST: Salo-Salo Together]]'' (1993\u20131995) =====\n''SST'' was first aired on March 20, 1993, as a replacement for ''[[Lunch Date]]'', hosted by [[Randy Santiago]], [[Dennis Padilla]], and Smokey Manaloto with [[Liezl Martinez]], Anjanette Abayari, Joy Ortega and Giselle Sanchez as co-hosts. In less than six months after it aired, SST started to take over ''[[Eat Bulaga!|Eat... Bulaga!]]'' in the ratings by providing fresh interactive segments. Comedians Ai-Ai delas Alas and Bayani Agbayani also became co-hosts of ''SST''.\n\nIt started as a [[blind item]] as 1994 was about to end until showbiz news had leaked out that ''SST'' was going to go off the air to give way to ''Eat... Bulaga!'' at the 12 pm slot, after ''EB'' itself had decided to move to GMA Network following their contract with ABS-CBN was bogged down. During ''SST''<nowiki/>'s New Year episode on December 31, 1994, the announcement of the new variety show's move to GMA was officially made by main hosts Randy Santiago and Dennis Padilla. The hosts and talents were sad because they felt the GMA Network management did not give them a chance to prove that they could carry the noontime show to new heights. But at the same time, they felt happy because the management decided to keep the show after they decided to move ''SST'' to an earlier time slot, as a pre-programming to ''Eat... Bulaga!''. SST made its last noontime episode on January 27, 1995. In June 1995, ''SST'' was permanently canceled.\n\n===== [['Sang Linggo nAPO Sila|''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila'']] (1995\u20131998) =====\nDue to ''Eat... Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s moved to rival GMA Network, ABS-CBN decided to make ''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' a weeklong noontime show as ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO SIla''. It aired its pilot episode on February 4, 1995 led by the famous APO Hiking Society, TVJ's former co-stars in ''OK Lang,'' a defunct TV show on IBC 13. During its first year, ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo'' was winning the ratings game in the provinces and cities where ABS-CBN have stronger signal. But the real challenge to the show was to deviate its content from the usual noontime variety show that ''Eat... Bulaga!'' presented to the viewers for almost two decades. Meanwhile, ''Bulaga'' had presented new faces like Allan K., Jose Manalo, and Donna Cruz, and new segments such as Super SiReyna and Philippine Bulaga Association. Calendar Girl was introduced by ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila'' in 1998 with John Estrada, Randy Santiago, and Willie Revillame handling the segment by delivering naughtier jokes on TV.\n\nThe rating for ''SLNS'' had improved but the main hosts did not sit well with the changes on their show. Eventually, ABS-CBN had ended again its own noontime show (due to criticisms that the show was too intelligent for an average Filipino) on November 28, 1998, with ''Magandang Tanghali Bayan'' taking place with its main hosts: Randy, John, and Willie.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|Magandang Tanghali Bayan]]'' (1998\u20132003) =====\nAfter the APO had failed to beat the continuing supremacy of ''EB'', the new triumvirate of Randy, John, and Willie was pitted to the established trio of Tito, Vic, and Joey as ABS-CBN launched its new noontime show on November 30, 1998, with the title ''Magandang Tanghali Bayan''. Its highlight segment, ''Pera O Bayong'', made ''MTB'' overtook ''Eat... Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s ratings for years. Due to the growing popularity of the show, ''EB'' gave its first millions on television through its new segments ''Meron O Wala'' and the all-time popular segment ''Laban O Bawi'' which featured the phenomenal all-female dance group ''Sexbomb Girls''. Meanwhile, ''MTB'' had faced numerous controversies and suspensions including the one-week suspension of the show in August 1999 due to the notorious green jokes of the main hosts. During that week, a placeholder show entitled ''Esep-Esep'' filled in the timeslot. In 2001, Willie Revillame was axed on the show which resulted in major changes in the set of new hosts and segments.\n\nAnother triumvirate was introduced on ''MTB'' when matinee idols Rico Yan, Dominic Ochoa, and Marvin Agustin joined the show after Willie's exit. Their inclusion resulted in the show bringing in a younger crowd and a more wholesome approach to noontime viewing. However, on March 29, 2002, Rico died during his Lenten vacation in Palawan and ''MTB'' later on reformatted on November 23, 2002, after it had lost its victory in terms of ratings to ''EB''.  The reformat, however, failed to stop the management in deciding to bring back Willie Revillame effective February 22, 2003, which lead to its second incarnation, ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan''.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|Masayang Tanghali Bayan]]'' (2003\u20132004) =====\n''Magandang Tanghali Bayan'' aired its last episode on February 21, 2003 and was replaced by ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'' as ABS-CBN's response to the noontime competition against ''Eat... Bulaga!''. The new MTB premiered on February 22, 2003 with Willie reunited with Randy Santiago and John Estrada together with other co-hosts Dennis Padilla, Aiai delas Alas, Bayani Agbayani, Mickey Ferriols, Aubrey Miles, Tado, and Bentong. The show had given out more cash prizes than its predecessor through the segments ''Super Jack En Poy'' and ''Urong Sulong'', that gave away 2 million pesos as a jackpot prize.\n\nBefore the end of 2003, Willie Revillame resigned from the show in the midst of controversy regarding his derogatory joke against their co-host Mahal. The show continued to air until February 2004 with comedian Vhong Navarro and actor-host Edu Manzano taking over Willie's place. However, ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'' failed to sustain viewership and was given the axe on February 20, 2004, two days before their first anniversary on television.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|MTB: Ang Saya Saya]]'' (2004\u20132005) =====\nThe third incarnation of ''MTB'', entitled ''MTB: Ang Saya Saya'' premiered on February 21, 2004 with Ai ai delas Alas, Edu Manzano, and Arnell Ignacio as its main hosts. The show also introduced new set of co-hosts and segments, especially reality talent-based search segments. However, these efforts were overshadowed by the spectacular ''Silver Anniversary Special'' of ''Eat Bulaga!'' which got the all-time highest rating of a noontime show exceeding to 30%. On November 15, 2004, ''MTB: Ang Saya Saya'' lost its 12:00pm slot to Kris Aquino's ''[[Pilipinas, Game KNB?]]'' and started airing as an afternoon variety show on a 1:00pm time slot as the network's strategic move against the anniversary special, but it had failed. After months of low ratings, the management decided to permanently cancelled the third incarnation of ''MTB'' on February 4, 2005 and launched a new noontime show under its new main host Willie Revillame.\n\n===== ''[[Wowowee]]'' (2005\u20132010) =====\nDue to public clamor, former ''MTB'' main host Willie Revillame made his comeback on the noontime slot with the new noontime show entitled ''Wowowee'' on February 5, 2005. ABS-CBN's strong reach in the Philippines and worldwide through TFC had helped ''Wowowee'' to lead the noontime race for years. Willie's novelty songs became popular because of ''Wowowee'' and it became an instant hit to the Filipino masses.\n\n''Wowowee'' also faced different controversies on its five-year run on television. The ULTRA Stampede which happened during the first anniversary of the show, lead to the death of 71 people. The [[Guinness World Records]] cited the incident as \"the greatest death toll in a game show\". Another controversy was the Hello Papi Scandal, wherein Revillame allegedly cheated a contestant during the jackpot round on one of the ''Wowowee''<nowiki/>'s game segments. The scandal also lead to a word war on-air between Willie and one of the ''EB''<nowiki/>'s main hosts Joey de Leon.\n\nThe competition became harder for ''Eat Bulaga!'' so they decided to have a different approach on celebrating their 30th anniversary in 2009 by honoring different people from different fields, giving scholarships to honor students, and constructing classrooms for public schools in different provinces. ''EB'' also renovated their studio to accommodate more studio audience, install LED screens, and to commemorate the first death anniversary of Francis Magalona on March 6, 2010. ''Eat Bulaga!'' also launched its widely popular segment ''Juan for All, All for Juan: Bayanihan of D' Pipol'' (a regular segment which broadcasts from different barangays).\n\nIn 2010, Willie challenged the ABS-CBN management to remove Jobert Sucaldito (radio/TV host) or he will resign from the noontime show due to Sucaldito's criticisms against Revillame and the show itself. SInce May 5, Willie did not appeared on ''Wowowee'' and it became an indefinite leave after numerous days. After negotiations between Revillame and the network, the network decided that ''Wowowee'' will air its final episode on July 30, 2010 (coinciding with ''Eat Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s 31st anniversary). The show was replaced by ''Pilipinas Win Na Win''. ''Wowowee'' become the ABS-CBN's longest-running noontime show that was pitted against ''Eat Bulaga!''. Willie is currently on GMA Network, hosting ''Wowowin'', a primetime variety game show with the same format with ''Wowowee''.\n\n===== ''[[Pilipinas Win Na Win]]'' (2010) =====\nAfter the cancellation of ''Wowowee'', ''Pilipinas Win Na Win'' premiered on July 31, 2010 with Kris Aquino and Robin Padilla as its main hosts, together with other co-hosts from ''Wowowee''. Some of the shows staff left the show to join Willie's comeback on TV5 In 2010. Suffering a plague of low ratings since launch, ABS-CBN asked Kris mid-September for her to leave the show, and so she quietly left the show without any goodbyes on September 2010. Two days later on October 2, ABS-CBN officially announced four new hosts and two new co-hosts. The four hosts tagged as the \"hitmakers\" include [[Rico J. Puno]], [[Rey Valera]], [[Marco Sison]], and [[Nonoy Zuniga]].\n\nAfter a battle of constant low ratings and many alternate time slots, ''Pilipinas Win Na Win'' ended on December 31, 2010 during the New Year celebration. The cancellation was announced by [[Rico J. Puno]] several times during the December 20 episode. Rumors of this issue were around entertainment websites from interviews of a fellow co-host, [[Valerie Concepcion]] before the network announced its cancellation. Its time slot was temporarily occupied by [[Showtime (Philippines)|''Showtime'']]. On February 12, 2011, a new noontime show was aired entitled ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]''. The show was ABS-CBN's shortest-lived noontime show.\n\n===== ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]'' (2011\u20132012) =====\nThe unsuccessful stint of ''PWNW'' was immediately replaced by ''Happy Yipee Yehey'' which premiered on February 12, 2011. Before its premiere, Willie Revillame (at that time, he was hosting ''Willing Willie'' on TV5) challenged its upcoming host John Estrada that the ''HYY'' will not reach its success in terms of ratings and Revillame will promote ''Eat Bulaga!'' constantly on his show. ''HYY'' was hosted by former ''MTB'' hosts John Estrada and Randy Santiago, Toni Gonzaga, Rico J. Puno, Pokwang, and others. The new noontime show introduced segments similar to its predecessors like ''Pera O Bayong'', ''My Girl'', ''Miss Kasamabahay'', etc.\n\nRevillame's prediction came to reality. ''HYY'' constantly got low ratings because of ''Eat Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s stronghold to its noontime viewership. On January 2012, ''Showtime'' was cancelled on its late morning slot and it was later revealed that ''Showtime'' will be formatted into a new noontime variety show, replacing ''HYY''. ''Happy Yipee Yehey'' aired its final episode on February 4, 2012 to give way to ABS-CBN's new noontime show, ''It's Showtime''.\n\n===== [[It's Showtime (TV program)|''It's Showtime'']] (2009\u2013present) =====\n''<nowiki/>Showtime'', a morning talent show that existed since October 24, 2009 as a lead-in program to ''Wowowee'', was a big hit among the viewers that it even eclipsed the ratings of both ''Wowowee'' and ''Eat Bulaga''.  The show tested the noontime waters in January 2011 as a temporary replacement for ''Pilipinas Win na Win'' before going back to the morning slot in February 2011 to give way to ''Happy Yipee Yehey!''.  \n\nThe solid performance of ''Showtime'' as the top morning variety show prompted ABS-CBN management to transfer it to the noontime slot as ''It's Showtime'' on February 6, 2012. The new noontime show introduced segments from the ''Showtime'' series and new segments like ''Sine Mo 'To'', ''AdVice Ganda'', ''That's My Tomboy'', ''I Am PoGay'', and ''Magpasikat''. The show is currently hosted by Vice Ganda, Anne Curtis, Vhong Navarro, Jhong Hilario, Karylle, Ryan Bang, Mariel Rodriguez, Amy Perez, Jugs and Teddy. Currently, they feature the segments Tawag ng Tanghalan and Ms. Q&A. All of these segments were hits and caused them to fare well with''Eat Bulaga'' in the ratings game since 2016, with EB leading in NUTAM and IS leading in KANTAR.\n\n== Sunday noontime shows ==\nCurrently, ABS-CBN's ''ASAP'' now holds the record of being the longest-running Sunday noontime variety show which was first aired in 1995 when ''Eat Bulaga!'' moved to GMA Network and the Sunday noontime show ''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' became a weeklong noontime show. During its 22nd anniversary, ''ASAP'' already surpassed the record of ''[[GMA Supershow]]'' as the longest-running Sunday noontime variety show.\n\nIts current rival program is ''All-Out Sundays'' aired on GMA Network. ''AOS'' aired its pilot episode in January 2020 as a replacement to ''Sunday PinaSaya''.\n\nOther popular defunct Sunday noontime variety shows are the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n![[GMA Network]]\n![[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]]\n|-\n|''[[GMA Supershow]]'' (May 7, 1978 - January 26, 1997)\n[[SOP (TV program)|''SOP'']] (February 2, 1997 - February 28, 2010)\n\n''[[Party Pilipinas]]'' (March 28, 2010 - May 19, 2013)\n\n''[[Sunday All Stars]]'' (June 16, 2013 - August 2, 2015)\n\n''[[Sunday PinaSaya]]'' (August 9, 2015 \u2013 December 29, 2019)\n\n'''[[All-Out Sundays|''All-Out Sundays'']] (January 5, 2020 \u2013 present)'''\n|''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' (January 28, 1990 - January 29, 1995)\n'''[[ASAP (TV program)|''ASAP'']] (February 5, 1995 \u2013 present)'''\n|-\n![[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|''[[P.O.5]]'' (April 11, 2010 - February 20, 2011)\n''[[Fan*tastik]]'' (February 27 - May 22, 2011)\n\n[[Sunday Funday (variety show)|''Sunday Funday'']] (April 8 - June 10, 2012)\n\n''[[Game 'N Go]]'' (June 17, 2012 - February 3, 2013)\n\n''[[Happy Truck ng Bayan]]'' (June 14, 2015 - February 7, 2016)\n\n''[[Happy Truck HAPPinas]]'' (March 6 - May 1, 2016) \n|}\n\n\n== List of weeklong noontime variety shows aired from 1958-present ==\n{| style=\"border: 1px solid darkgray; background: #CFECEC\"\n|Series shaded in light blue are currently in production.\n|}\nLength of current noontime shows are as of February 6, 2018.

In 2002, he began teaching social entrepreneurship at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] and the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at [[MIT]], where he remains a senior lecturer.\n\n==Work in social entrepreneurship==\nWolk launched his first social enterprise, the Social Innovation Forum, in 2003 with several colleagues who sought to help nonprofit leaders obtain the resources needed to solve problems plaguing Greater Boston. Around the same time, he and Boston University sociology professor Daniel Monti developed another enterprise, InnerCity Entrepreneurs (ICE), to support existing businesses interested in growth in the [[inner city]]. By creating a [[social network]] for entrepreneurs and using professional business tactics, they developed a blueprint to help inner-city businesses function more efficiently and effectively. \n\nAs he focused on growing his two social enterprises, Wolk recognized a need for an incubator that would nurture and guide the development of nonprofits. He created Root Cause in 2004 to foster entrepreneurship and innovation, and to develop enduring solutions to social and economic problems. Using his methodology has allowed Root Cause to specialize in developing [[business plan]]s for nonprofits and government agencies focusing on growth, sustainability and impact. \n\nWolk also helped to establish the Boston chapter of Social Venture Partners. He was the program co-chair for the 4th National Gathering for Social Entrepreneurs, and he served on the board of the Social Enterprise Alliance. He holds an M.B.A. in entrepreneurship and nonprofit management from Boston University and a B.A. from [[Lehigh University]]. A resident of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], Wolk is based in Root Cause's [[Boston, Massachusetts]] headquarters.\n\n==Publications==\nWolk has authored three publications: a Root Cause How-to Guide, entitled Business Planning for Enduring Social Impact; a chapter in the [[Small Business Administration]]\u2019s annual report to the president of the [[United States]], titled \u201cSocial Entrepreneurship and Government: A New Breed of Entrepreneurs Developing Solutions to Social Problems\u201d; and a white paper copublished with the [[Aspen Institute]], titled Advancing Social Entrepreneurship: Recommendations for Policy Makers and Government Agencies.\n\n==Honors and awards==\nAndrew Wolk received the first Rising Star Award from Boston University's School of Management.

O&Ms are considered one of the major barriers for further development of this resource.\n\nMaintenance of offshore wind farms is much more expensive than for onshore installations.\nFor example, a single technician in a pickup truck can quickly, easily and safely access turbines on land in almost any weather conditions, exit his or her vehicle and simply walk over to and into the turbine tower to gain access to the entire unit within minutes of arriving onsite. \nSimilar access to offshore turbines involves driving to a dock or pier, loading necessary tools and supplies into boat, a voyage to the wind turbine(s), securing the boat to the turbine structure, transferring tools and supplies to and from boat to turbine and turbine to boat and performing the rest of the steps in reverse order. \nIn addition to standard safety gear such as a hardhat, gloves and safety glasses, an offshore turbine technician may be required to wear a life vest, waterproof or water-resistant clothing and perhaps even a survival suit if working, sea and atmospheric conditions make rapid rescue in case of a fall into the water unlikely or impossible.\nTypically at least two technicians skilled and trained in operating and handling large power boats at sea are required for tasks that one technician with a driver's license can perform on land in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost.\n\n===Cost of energy===\nCost for installed offshore turbines fell 30% to $78/MWh in 2019, a more rapid drop than other types of renewable energy.<ref name=bnef2019/>\nIt has been suggested that

With one of the main reasons for interest in offshore wind power being the higher wind speeds, some of the loading differences will come from higher shearing forces between the top and bottom of the wind turbine due to differences in wind speeds. There should also be considerations for the buffeting loads that will be experienced by the waves around the base of the tower, which converges on the use of steel tubular towers for offshore wind applications.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Chong|first=Ng|title=Offshore wind farms : technologies, design and operation|date=2016-03-03|publisher=Elsevier, WP Woodhead Publishing|others=Ng, Chong,, Ran, Li|year=2016|isbn=978-0-08-100780-8|location=Duxford, UK|pages=|oclc=944186047}}</ref>\n\nSince there\u2019s constant exposure to salt and water for offshore wind turbines, the steel used for the monopile and turbine tower must be treated for corrosion resistance, especially at the base of the tower in the \u201csplash zone\u201d for waves breaking against the tower and in the monopile.

These piles can be 4&nbsp;m in diameter with approximately 50mm thick walls. \nA transition piece (complete with pre-installed features such as boat-landing arrangement, [[cathodic protection]], cable ducts for sub-marine cables, turbine tower flange, etc.) is attached to the now deeply driven pile, the sand and water are removed from the centre of the pile and replaced with [[concrete]]. An additional layer of even larger stone, up to 0.5&nbsp;m diameter, is applied to the surface of the seabed for longer-term erosion protection.<ref name=hre20100412/>\n\nFor the ease of installing the towers and connecting them to the seabed, they are installed in two parts, the portion below the water surface and the portion above the water.<ref name=\":0\" /> The two portions of the tower are joined by a transition piece which is filled with a grouted connection. The grouted connected helps transfer the loads experienced by the turbine tower to the more stable monopile foundation of the turbine. One technique for strengthening the grout used in the connections is to include weld beads known as shear keys along the length of the grout connection to prevent any sliding between the monopile and the tower.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tziavos|first=Nikolaos I.|last2=Hemida|first2=Hassan|last3=Metje|first3=Nicole|last4=Baniotopoulos|first4=Charalampos|date=2016-06-08|title=Grouted connections on offshore wind turbines: a review|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Engineering and Computational Mechanics|volume=169|issue=4|pages=183\u2013195|doi=10.1680/jencm.16.00004|issn=1755-0777|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/27996593/Tziavos_et_al_Grouted_connections_Proceedings_ICE_Accepted.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Grid connection==\n[[File:Dolwin Beta (14823021740).jpg|thumb|An offshore structure for housing an [[HVDC converter station]] for offshore wind parks is being moved by a [[heavy-lift ship]] in Norway.]]\nThere are several different types of technologies that are being explored as viable options for integrating offshore wind power into the onshore grid. The most conventional method is through high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) transmission lines. HVAC transmission lines are currently the most commonly used form of grid connections for offshore wind turbines.<ref name=\"second\">{{cite web |last1=Daniel |first1=John |last2=Liu |first2=Shu |last3=Ibanez |first3=Eduardo |last4=Pennock |first4=Ken |last5=Reed |first5=Gregory |last6=Hanes |first6=Spencer |title=National Offshore Wind Energy Grid Interconnection Study Executive Summary |url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/08/f18/NOWEGIS%20Executive%20Summary.pdf |accessdate=1 May 2019}}</ref> However, there are significant limitations that prevent HVAC from being practical, especially as the distance to offshore turbines increases. First, HVAC is limited by cable charging currents,<ref name=\"second\"/> which are a result of capacitance in the cables. Undersea AC cables have a much higher capacitance than overhead AC cables, so losses due to capacitance become much more significant, and the voltage magnitude at the receiving end of the transmission line can be significantly different from the magnitude at the receiving end. In order to compensate for these losses, either more cables or reactive compensation must be added to the system. Both of these add costs to the system.<ref name=\"second\"/> Additionally, because HVAC cables have both [[AC power#Active, reactive, and apparent power|real and reactive power]] flowing through them, there can be additional losses.<ref name=\"third\">{{cite book |last1=Anaya-Lara |first1=Olimpo |last2=Campos-Gaona |first2=David |last3=Moreno-Goytia |first3=Edgar |last4=Adam |first4=Grain |title=Grid Integration of Offshore Wind Farms \u2013 Case Studies |date=10 April 2014 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=9781118701638 |doi=10.1002/9781118701638.ch5 }}</ref> Because of these losses, underground HVAC lines are limited in how far they can extend. The maximum appropriate distance for HVAC transmission for offshore wind power is considered to be around 80&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"second\"/>\n\nUsing high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cables has been a proposed alternative to using HVAC cables. HVDC transmission cables are not affected by the cable charging currents and experience less power loss because HVDC does not transmit reactive power.<ref name=\"first\">{{cite journal |last1=Torres-Olguin |first1=Raymundo |last2=Molinas |first2=Marta |last3=Undeland |first3=Tore |title=Offshore Wind Farm Grid Integration by VSC Technology With LCC-Based HVDC Transmission |journal=IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy |date=October 2012 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=899 |bibcode=2012ITSE....3..899T |doi=10.1109/TSTE.2012.2200511 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af131da3f013047e518a48ef55569f63c272872f }}</ref> With less losses, undersea HVDC lines can extend much farther than HVAC.

Both [[HVDC converter#Line-commutated converters|line commutated converters (LCCs)]] and [[HVDC converter#Voltage-source converters|voltage source converters (VSCs)]] have been considered for this. Although LCCs are a much more widespread technology and cheaper, VSCs have many more benefits, including independent active power and reactive power control.<ref name=\"first\"/> New research has been put into developing hybrid HVDC technologies that have a LCC connected to a VSC through a DC cable.<ref name=\"first\"/>\n\nIn order to transport the energy from offshore wind turbines to onshore energy plants, cabling has to be placed along the ocean floor.

O&Ms are considered one of the major barriers for further development of this resource.\n\nMaintenance of offshore wind farms is much more expensive than for onshore installations.\nFor example, a single technician in a pickup truck can quickly, easily and safely access turbines on land in almost any weather conditions, exit his or her vehicle and simply walk over to and into the turbine tower to gain access to the entire unit within minutes of arriving onsite. \nSimilar access to offshore turbines involves driving to a dock or pier, loading necessary tools and supplies into boat, a voyage to the wind turbine(s), securing the boat to the turbine structure, transferring tools and supplies to and from boat to turbine and turbine to boat and performing the rest of the steps in reverse order. \nIn addition to standard safety gear such as a hardhat, gloves and safety glasses, an offshore turbine technician may be required to wear a life vest, waterproof or water-resistant clothing and perhaps even a survival suit if working, sea and atmospheric conditions make rapid rescue in case of a fall into the water unlikely or impossible.\nTypically at least two technicians skilled and

Undersea AC cables have a much higher capacitance than overhead AC cables, so losses due to capacitance become much more significant, and the voltage magnitude at the receiving end of the transmission line can be significantly different from the magnitude at the receiving end. In order to compensate for these losses, either more cables or reactive compensation must be added to the system.

HVDC transmission cables are not affected by the cable charging currents and experience less power loss because HVDC does not transmit reactive power.<ref name=\"first\">{{cite journal |last1=Torres-Olguin |first1=Raymundo |last2=Molinas |first2=Marta |last3=Undeland |first3=Tore |title=Offshore Wind Farm Grid Integration by VSC Technology With LCC-Based HVDC Transmission |journal=IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy |date=October 2012 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=899 |bibcode=2012ITSE....3..899T |doi=10.1109/TSTE.2012.2200511 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af131da3f013047e518a48ef55569f63c272872f }}</ref> With less losses, undersea HVDC lines can extend much farther than HVAC. This makes HVDC preferable for siting wind turbines very far offshore. However, HVDC requires power converters in order to connect to the AC grid. Both [[HVDC converter#Line-commutated converters|line commutated converters (LCCs)]] and [[HVDC converter#Voltage-source converters|voltage source converters (VSCs)]] have been considered for this. Although LCCs are a much more widespread technology and cheaper, VSCs have many more benefits, including independent active power and reactive power control.<ref name=\"first\"/> New research has been put into developing hybrid HVDC technologies that have a LCC connected to a VSC through a DC cable.<ref name=\"first\"/>\n\nIn order to transport the energy from offshore wind turbines to onshore energy plants, cabling has to be placed along the ocean floor. The cabling has to be able to transfer large amounts of current efficiently which requires optimization of the materials used for the cabling as well as determining cable paths for the use of a minimal amount of cable materials.<ref name=\":0\" /> One way to reduce the cost of the cables used in these applications is to convert the copper conductors to aluminum conductors, however the suggested replacement brings up an issue of increased cable motion and potential damage since aluminum is less dense than copper.\n\n==Maintenance==\n[[File:P1280269 - R\u00f8dsand I Offshore Wind Farm in Fehmarn Belt.jpg|thumb|Offshore wind turbines of the [[R\u00f8dsand Wind Farm]] in the [[Fehmarn Belt]], the western part of the Baltic Sea between Germany and Denmark (2010)]]\nTurbines are much less accessible when offshore (requiring the use of a service vessel or [[helicopter]] for routine access, and a [[jackup rig]] for heavy service such as gearbox replacement), and thus [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] is more important than for an onshore turbine.<ref name=\"btm2010o\"/> Some wind farms located far from possible onshore bases have service teams living on site in [[Accommodation platform|offshore accommodation units]].<ref name=\"dong\">[http://www.dongenergy.com/hornsrev2/en/about_horns_rev_2/about_the_project/pages/{{Not a typo|accom|odation}}_platform.aspx Accommodation Platform] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719235519/http://www.dongenergy.com/hornsrev2/en/about_horns_rev_2/about_the_project/pages/{{Not a typo|date=July 19, 2011|accomo|dation}}_platform.aspx |date=July 19, 2011 }} ''[[DONG Energy]]'', February 2010.

According to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government (supported by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]]),<ref name=zehn/> making field data from these turbines available would be invaluable in validating complex analysis codes used for turbine design.

Although the origin of the poem was disputed until later in her life, Mary Frye's authorship was purportedly confirmed in 1998 after research by [[Abigail Van Buren]], a newspaper columnist.<ref name=\"timesobit\">{{cite news|title=Mary E.

I do not sleep. \nI am a thousand winds that blow. \nI am the diamond glints on snow. \nI am the sunlight on ripened grain. \nI am the gentle autumn rain. \nWhen you awaken in the morning's hush \nI am the swift uplifting rush \nOf quiet birds in circled flight. \nI am the soft stars that shine at night. \nDo not stand at my grave and cry; \nI am not there. I did not die.}}\n\n==Origins==\nThere have been many claimants to the poem's authorship, including attributions to traditional and Native American origins. ''[[Dear Abby]]'' author [[Pauline Phillips|Abigail Van Buren]] researched the poem's history and concluded in 1998 that [[Mary Elizabeth Frye]], who was living in Baltimore at the time, had written the poem in 1932. According to Van Buren's research, Frye had never written any poetry, but the plight of a German Jewish woman, Margaret Schwarzkopf, who was staying with her and her husband, had inspired the poem. Margaret Schwarzkopf was concerned about her mother, who was ill in Germany, but she had been warned not to return home because of increasing unrest. When her mother died, the heartbroken young woman told Frye that she never had the chance to \"stand by my mother's grave and shed a tear\". Frye, according to Van Buren's research, found herself composing a piece of verse on a brown paper shopping bag. Later she said that the words \"just came to her\" and expressed what she felt about life and death.<ref name=\"timesobit\"/> \n\nFrye circulated the poem privately, never publishing it. She wrote other poems, but this, her first, endured. Her obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' stated that she was the author of the famous poem, which has been recited at funerals and on other appropriate occasions around the world for 60 years.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary|journal=London Magazine|date=December 2005}}</ref>\n\nHowever, other, similar versions of this poem had been circulating for some time and were sometimes found in tombstones prior to when Frye claimed to have written the poem, and Frye did not produce any real evidence that she actually wrote this work. In addition, while there had been considerable anti-semitism in Germany back in 1932, the Nazis did not win power till 1933, weakening the veracity of Frey's story which was never corroborated.\n\nThe poem was introduced to many in the United Kingdom when it was read by the father of a soldier killed by a bomb in [[Northern Ireland]]. The soldier's father read the poem on BBC radio in 1995 in remembrance of his son, who had left the poem among his personal effects in an envelope addressed 'To all my loved ones'.\n\nThe poem is common reading for funerals.\n\n==BBC poll==\nTo coincide with National Poetry Day 1995, the British television programme ''The Bookworm'' conducted a poll to discover the nation's favourite poems, and subsequently published the winning poems in book form.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Nation's Favourite Poems| year=1996| publisher=BBC Books| isbn=978-0-563-38782-4}}</ref>  The book's preface stated that \"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" was \"the unexpected poetry success of the year from Bookworm's point of view\"; the poem had \"provoked an extraordinary response... the requests started coming in almost immediately and over the following weeks the demand rose to a total of some thirty thousand.

Retrieved November 25, 2012.</ref> This was all the more remarkable, since the name and nationality of the American poet did not become known until several years later. In 2004 ''[[The Times]]'' wrote: \"The verse demonstrated a remarkable power to soothe loss. It became popular, crossing national boundaries for use on bereavement cards and at funerals regardless of race, religion or social status\".<ref name=\"timesobit\"/>\n\n==Translations==\nThe poem has been translated into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Ilocano, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, and other languages. Several Swedish versions exist. One version starts: \"Gr\u00e5t ej vid min grav...\" Translated, it reads: \"Do not weep at my grave - I am not there / I am in the sun's reflection in the sea / I am in the wind's play above the grain fields / I am in the autumn's gentle rain / I am in the [[Milky Way]]'s string of stars / And when on an early morning you are awaked by bird's song / It is my voice that you are hearing / So do not weep at my grave - we shall meet again.\" (Instead of these last four words there is also this version: \"I am not dead. I only left\".)\n\nEvery so often the poem and similar variations appear in death and funeral announcements in Swedish morning papers (such as ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' August 14, 2010). On August 29, 2010, the Swedish newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' carried the following short English version: \"I am thousand winds that blow / I am the diamond glints on snow / I am the sunlight, I am the rain / Do not stand on my grave and cry / I am not there / I did not die\".\n\n==Derivative works==\nSeveral notable choral compositions, pop songs, and other creative works have been based on \"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\", adapting lines from Frye's poem as lyrics.\n\n*''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' (song by Monks of Doom): Parts of \"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" are interpolated with the lyrics to the rock song \"The Better Angels of Our Nature,\" from the 1991 [[Monks of Doom]] album ''Meridian.''\n*''Requiem'' (composition by Eleanor Joanne Daley): [[Eleanor Joanne Daley]]'s ''Requiem'' (1993) includes a movement titled \"In Remembrance\", which uses the poem as its text. The movement has also been published as a stand-alone work.\n*\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" (song by Matthew Levine (ASCAP) - 2019: the lyrics are a very close adaptation of the poem.

It is part of Newman's  song cycle, [[Songs On Motherhood]] in G Major, Op. 36, No. 2: V. In Newman's setting the poem clearly states that death is not an end, but a metamorphosis that makes possible a melding with our physical earth and metaphysical surroundings. In this final movement, the voice emerges with a prayerful plainchant, as the tutti ensemble blossoms into the movement proper.\n*\"The Ballad of Mair\u00e9ad Farrell\" (song by Seanchai and the Unity Squad): On [[Seanchai and the Unity Squad]]'s 1998 album ''Rebel Hip Hop'', the song \"The Ballad of Mair\u00e9ad Farrell\" tells the story of [[Mair\u00e9ad Farrell]], a member of the [[Irish Republican Army]], and her imprisonment and eventual death at the hands of British security forces in [[Gibraltar]]. The song uses the opening couplet from the poem, and alters the closing couplet to say, \"Do not stand at my grave and cry / When Ireland lives, I do not die.\"\n*\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" (song by Alias Grace): On ''Embers'', the 1998 debut album by British ambient folk duo Alias Grace ([[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]] and Sandra O'Neill), the closing track is a straight setting of the original poem for piano, voice, guitar and [[Chapman Stick]].\n*\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" (composition by Paul K. Joyce): At the request of a friend who had been diagnosed with cancer, composer [[Paul K. Joyce]] wrote a song for her funeral, setting the text of \"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" to music. Joyce subsequently incorporated the composition into a larger [[oratorio]] (1998) and the score for a [[BBC]] adaptation of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Snow Queen]]'' (2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesnowqueenpkj.com/ |title=The Snow Queen - A magical adventure told through songs and poems.

Other singers later covered the song, among them Japanese [[tenor]] [[Masafumi Akikawa]]. The tenor made the song popular after performing it during the [[57th NHK K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]] on December 31, 2006. In January 2007, it became the first [[classical music]] piece to top the [[Oricon]] weekly singles chart and became the first classical music piece to top the Oricon yearly singles chart.

Its last movement is a setting of this poem, with slight alterations to the words.\n*''Eternal Light: A Requiem'' (composition by Howard Goodall): [[Howard Goodall]]'s choral orchestral work ''Eternal Light: A Requiem'' was recorded in 2008 with the Choir of [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]]. \"Do not stand\" is in the Lacrymosa which is track 5.\n*\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" (composition by [[Kevin Siegfried]]) : The poem forms the lyrics for this piece for Soprano Solo and Keyboard or Harp from Siegfried's Cantata ''Songs for the Journey'' written in 2010 <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kevinsiegfried.com/do-not-stand-at-my-grave-and-weep|title=Do Not Stand At My Grave And Weep|website=Kevin Siegfried|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref>\n*\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" (song by Harry Manx and Kevin Breit): A song of this title, with lyrics adapted from the poem, appears on the album ''Strictly Whatever'' by the duo [[Harry Manx]] and [[Kevin Breit]].

It became popular, crossing national boundaries for use on bereavement cards and at funerals regardless of race, religion or social status\".<ref name=\"timesobit\"/>\n\n==Translations==\nThe poem has been translated into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Ilocano, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, and other languages. Several Swedish versions exist. One version starts: \"Gr\u00e5t ej vid min grav...\" Translated, it reads: \"Do not weep at my grave - I am not there / I am in the sun's reflection in the sea / I am in the wind's play above the grain fields / I am in the autumn's gentle rain / I am in the [[Milky Way]]'s string of stars / And when on an early morning you are awaked by bird's song / It is my voice that you are hearing / So do not weep at my grave - we shall meet again.\" (Instead of these last four words there is also this version: \"I am not dead. I only left\".)\n\nEvery so often the poem and similar variations appear in death and funeral announcements in Swedish morning papers (such as ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' August 14, 2010). On August 29, 2010, the Swedish newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' carried the following short English version: \"I am thousand winds that blow / I am the diamond glints on snow / I am the sunlight, I am the rain / Do not stand on my grave and cry / I am not there / I did not die\".\n\n==Derivative works==\nSeveral notable choral compositions, pop songs, and other creative works have been based on \"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\", adapting lines from Frye's poem as lyrics.\n\n*''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' (song by Monks of Doom): Parts of \"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" are interpolated with the lyrics to the rock song \"The Better Angels of Our Nature,\" from the 1991 [[Monks of Doom]] album ''Meridian.''\n*''Requiem'' (composition by Eleanor Joanne Daley): [[Eleanor Joanne Daley]]'s ''Requiem'' (1993) includes a movement titled \"In Remembrance\", which uses the poem as its text.

It is part of Newman's  song cycle, [[Songs On Motherhood]] in G Major, Op. 36, No. 2: V. In Newman's setting the poem clearly states that death is not an end, but a metamorphosis that makes possible a melding with our physical earth and metaphysical surroundings. In this final movement, the voice emerges with a prayerful plainchant, as the tutti ensemble blossoms into the movement proper.\n*\"The Ballad of Mair\u00e9ad Farrell\" (song by Seanchai and the Unity Squad): On [[Seanchai and the Unity Squad]]'s 1998 album ''Rebel Hip Hop'', the song \"The Ballad of Mair\u00e9ad Farrell\" tells the story of [[Mair\u00e9ad Farrell]], a member of the [[Irish Republican Army]], and her imprisonment and eventual death at the hands of British security forces in [[Gibraltar]]. The song uses the opening couplet from the poem, and alters the closing couplet to say, \"Do not stand at my grave and cry / When Ireland lives, I do not die.\"\n*\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" (song by Alias Grace): On ''Embers'', the 1998 debut album by British ambient folk duo Alias Grace ([[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]] and Sandra O'Neill), the closing track is a straight setting of the original poem for piano, voice, guitar and [[Chapman Stick]].\n*\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" (composition by Paul K. Joyce): At the request of a friend who had been diagnosed with cancer, composer [[Paul K. Joyce]] wrote a song for her funeral, setting the text of \"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\" to music. Joyce subsequently incorporated the composition into a larger [[oratorio]] (1998) and the score for a [[BBC]] adaptation of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Snow Queen]]'' (2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesnowqueenpkj.com/ |title=The Snow Queen - A magical adventure told through songs and poems.
