In his book ''[[Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor|Weaving The Web]]'', he explains that he had repeatedly suggested to members of ''both'' technical communities that a marriage between the two technologies was possible. But, when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies:\n* a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal document identifier (UDI), later known as [[uniform resource locator]] (URL) and [[uniform resource identifier]] (URI);\n* the publishing language [[Hypertext Markup Language]] (HTML);\n* the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive: The World Wide Web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]: MIT School of Engineering|accessdate=23 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608081841/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|archivedate=8 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of ''[[link rot]]''. Unlike predecessors such as [[HyperCard]], the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the [[World Wide Web]] would be free to anyone, with no fees due.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|title=Ten Years Public Domain for the Original Web Software|publisher=Tenyears-www.web.cern.ch|date=30 April 2003|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813032723/http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and toward the Web.

Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become by far the most popular protocol on the Internet. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at [[INRIA]] (a French national computer research lab) with support from the [[European Commission]] DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at [[Keio University]]. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many [[List of websites founded before 1995|notable websites]] were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.\n\nConnected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the [[markup language]]s to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a [[Semantic Web]]. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Internet|title=Internet legal definition of Internet|publisher=Free Online Law Dictionary|date=15 July 2009|encyclopedia=West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2|accessdate=25 November 2008}}</ref> Although the two terms are sometimes [[conflation|conflated]] in popular use, ''World Wide Web'' is not [[synonym]]ous with ''Internet''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techterms.com/definition/www|title=WWW (World Wide Web) Definition|publisher=TechTerms|accessdate=19 February 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511015356/http://www.techterms.com/definition/www|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Web is an [[information space]] containing hyperlinked documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], identified by their URIs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ian|last2=Walsh|first2=Norman|title=Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro|publisher=W3C|accessdate=11 February 2015|location=Introduction|date=15 December 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209063216/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro|archivedate=9 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is implemented as both client and server software using Internet protocols such as [[TCP/IP]] and [[HTTP]].\n\nBerners-Lee was [[Order of the British Empire|knighted]] in 2004 by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] for \"services to the global development of the Internet\".<ref name=\"gaz\">{{cite web|title=Supplement no.1, Diplomatic and Overseas List, K.B.E.|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/57155/supplement/24/data.pdf|website=thegazette.co.uk|publisher=The Gazette|date=31 December 2003|accessdate=7 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203092022/https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/57155/supplement/24/data.pdf|archivedate=3 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Web's inventor gets a knighthood|publisher=BBC|date=31 December 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3357073.stm|accessdate=25 May 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223055131/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3357073.stm|archivedate=23 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He never patented his invention.\n\n== Function ==\n{{main|HTTP|HTML}}\n[[File:Internet Key Layers.png|thumb|The World Wide Web functions as an [[application layer]] [[communications protocol|protocol]] that is run \"on top of\" (figuratively) the Internet, helping to make it more functional.

However, the two terms do not mean the same thing. The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], linked by hyperlinks and [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]]. Web resources are accessed using [[HTTP]] or [[HTTPS]], which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?|url=https://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=18 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422072749/http://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nViewing a [[web page]] on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the [[uniform resource locator|URL]] of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages\u2014and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks\u2014came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after [[channel surfing]]), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Muylle|first=Steve|author2=Rudy Moenaert|author3=Marc Despont|title=A grounded theory of World Wide Web search behaviour|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|year=1999|volume=5|issue=3|page=143|doi=10.1080/135272699345644|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL <code><nowiki>http://www.example.org/home.html</nowiki></code>. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (<code>www.example.org</code>) into an [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] using the globally distributed [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as ''203.0.113.4'' or ''2001:db8:2e::7334''. The browser then requests the resource by sending an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific [[TCP]] port number that is well known for the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing.  The HTTP protocol normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 80]] and for HTTPS protocol it normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 443]]. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nGET /home.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.org\n</source>\n\nThe computer receiving the [[HTTP]] request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n</source>\n\nfollowed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language ([[HTML]]) for a basic web page might look like this:\n<source lang=\"html\">\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>www.Example.org \u2013 The World Wide Web</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThe web browser [[parsing|parses]] the [[HTML]] and interprets the markup (<source lang=\"html\" inline><title></source>, <source lang=\"HTML\" inline><p></source> for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, [[Client-side scripting|scripts]] that affect page behaviour, and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other [[Internet media type]]s. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively [[Browser engine|renders]] the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.\n\n=== HTML ===\n{{main|HTML}}\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard [[markup language]] for creating [[web page]]s and [[web application]]s. With [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) and [[JavaScript]], it forms a triad of [[cornerstone]] technologies for the World Wide Web.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flanagan|first1=David|title=JavaScript \u2013 The definitive guide|page=1|edition=6|quote=JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all Web developers must learn: HTML to specify the content of web pages, CSS to specify the presentation of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the behaviour of web pages.}}</ref>\n\n[[Web browser]]s receive HTML documents from a [[web server]] or from local storage and [[browser engine|render]] the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page [[Semantic Web|semantically]] and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\n\n[[HTML element]]s are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, [[HTML element#Images and objects|images]] and other objects such as [[Fieldset|interactive forms]] may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create [[structured document]]s by denoting structural [[semantics]] for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, [[Hyperlink|links]], quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by ''tags'', written using [[Bracket#Angle brackets|angle brackets]]. Tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<img />}} and {{code|lang=html|<input />}} directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<p>}} surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.\n\nHTML can embed programs written in a [[scripting language]] such as [[JavaScript]], which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML {{as of|1997|lc=y|since=y|post=.}}<ref name=\"deprecated\">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40-971218/conform.html#deprecated|title=HTML 4.0 Specification \u2013 W3C Recommendation \u2013 Conformance: requirements and recommendations|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=December 18, 1997|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Linking ===\nMost web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:\n<source lang=\"html\" inline><a href=\"http://www.example.org/home.html\">www.Example.org Homepage</a></source>\n[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]\nSuch a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a ''web'' of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the ''WorldWideWeb'' (in its original [[CamelCase]], which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.<ref name=\"W90\" />\n\nThe hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the [[webgraph]]: the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called [[dead link]]s. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites. The [[Internet Archive]], active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.\n\n=== WWW prefix ===\n<!-- WWW prefix redirects here -->\nMany hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with ''www'' because of the long-standing practice of naming [[Internet]] hosts according to the services they provide. The [[hostname]] of a [[web server]] is often ''www'', in the same way that it may be ''ftp'' for an [[FTP server]], and ''news'' or ''nntp'' for a [[Usenet]] [[news server]]. These host names appear as Domain Name System (DNS) or [[subdomain]] names, as in ''www.example.com''. The use of ''www'' is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it; the first web server was ''nxoc01.cern.ch''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|title=Frequently asked questions by the Press|first=Tim|last=Berners-Lee|publisher=W3C|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802051415/http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|archivedate=2 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to Paolo Palazzi,<ref>Palazzi, P (2011) [http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays 'The Early Days of the WWW at CERN'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723105704/http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays |date=23 July 2012 }}</ref> who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of ''www'' as subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page, however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prepending ''www'' to an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as ''www2'', ''secure'' or ''en'' for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the ''www'' subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful for [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] incoming web traffic by creating a [[CNAME record]] that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-cant-a-domain-s-root-be-a-cname-8cbab38e5f5c |title=Why a domain's root can't be a CNAME \u2013 and other tidbits about the DNS |author=Dominic Fraser |date=May 13, 2018 |work=FreeCodeCamp}}</ref>{{Dubious |reason=While CNAMEs are more flexible than the bare domain requiring an A Record, load balancing is certainly possible even for sites that skip www and use the bare domain \u2014 see, for example, Twitter.|date=July 2019}}\n\nWhen a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix \"www\" to the beginning of it and possibly \".com\", \".org\" and \".net\" at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering '{{not a typo|microsoft}}' may be transformed to ''<nowiki>http://www.microsoft.com/</nowiki>'' and 'openoffice' to ''<nowiki>http://www.openoffice.org</nowiki>''. This feature started appearing in early versions of [[Firefox]], when it still had the working title 'Firebird' in early 2003, from an earlier practice in browsers such as [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=10980|title=automatically adding www.___.com|publisher=mozillaZine|date=16 May 2003|accessdate=27 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627225046/http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=10980|archivedate=27 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> {{unreliable source?|date=November 2016}} It is reported that Microsoft was granted a US patent for the same idea in 2008, but only for mobile devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techdirt.com/articles/20080626/0203581527.shtml|title=Microsoft Patents Adding 'www.'

They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web, and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data, such as passwords or banking information. Web browsers usually automatically prepend <nowiki>http://</nowiki> to user-entered URIs, if omitted.\n\n===Pages===\n{{main|Web page}}\n[[File:Commons.png|thumb|A screenshot of a web page on Wikimedia Commons]]\nA ''web page'' (also written as ''webpage'') is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and [[web browser]]s. A web browser displays a web page on a [[computer display|monitor]] or [[mobile device]].\n\nThe term ''web page'' usually refers to what is visible, but may also refer to the contents of the [[computer file]] itself, which is usually a [[text file]] containing [[hypertext]] written in [[HTML]] or a comparable [[markup language]]. Typical web pages provide [[hypertext]] for browsing to other web pages via [[hyperlink]]s, often referred to as ''links''. Web browsers will frequently have to access multiple [[web resource]] elements, such as reading [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheets]], [[client-side scripting|scripts]], and images, while presenting each web page.\n\nOn a network, a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote [[web server]]. The web server may restrict access to a private network such as a corporate intranet. The web browser uses the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) to make such requests to the [[web server]].\n\nA [[static web page|''static'' web page]] is delivered exactly as stored, as [[web content]] in the web server's [[file system]]. In contrast, a [[dynamic web page|''dynamic'' web page]] is generated by a [[web application]], usually driven by [[server-side scripting|server-side software]]. Dynamic web pages are used when each user may require completely different information, for example, bank websites, web email etc.\n\n==== Static page ====\n{{main|Static web page}}\nA ''static web page'' (sometimes called a ''flat page/stationary page'') is a [[web page]] that is delivered to the user exactly as stored, in contrast to [[dynamic web page]]s which are generated by a [[web application]].\n\nConsequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a [[web server]] to [[content negotiation|negotiate]] [[MIME type|content-type]] or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.\n\n==== Dynamic pages ====\n{{Main|Dynamic web page|Ajax (programming)}}\n[[File:Scheme dynamic page en.svg|thumb|right|500px|Dynamic web page: example of server-side scripting ([[PHP]] and [[MySQL]]).]]\nA ''server-side dynamic web page'' is a [[web page]] whose construction is controlled by an [[application server]] processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nA ''client-side dynamic web page'' processes the web page using [[HTML scripting]] running in the browser as it loads.  JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the [[Document Object Model]], or DOM, that represents the loaded web page.  The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.\n\nA dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a [[computer program]] to change some variable content.  The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a ''dynamic web page update'' using [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the [[web browsing history]] forward of the displayed page.  Using Ajax technologies the end [[User (computing)|user]] gets ''one dynamic page'' managed as a single page in the [[web browser]] while the actual [[web content]] rendered on that page can vary.  The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, ''the'' DOM, for its client, from an application server.\n\n[[DHTML]] is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not [[static web page]]s, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]], a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.\n\n[[JavaScript]] is a [[scripting programming language|scripting language]] that was initially developed in 1995 by [[Brendan Eich]], then of [[Netscape]], for use within web pages.<ref name=Hamilton>{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Naomi|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript|url=http://computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|date=31 July 2008|work=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=12 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524025720/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|archivedate=24 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The standardised version is [[ECMAScript]].<ref name=Hamilton /> To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] ([[Asynchronous I/O|asynchronous]] JavaScript and [[XML]]). [[Client-side scripting|Client-side script]] is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularly [[polling (computer science)|poll]] the server to check whether new information is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|title=jQuery Polling plugin|date=23 September 2008|last=Buntin|first=Seth|accessdate=2009-08-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813184848/http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Website===\n[[File:United States Antarctic Program website from 2018 02 22.png|thumb|right|240px|The [[United States Antarctic Program|usap.gov]] website]]\n{{main|website}}\nA ''website''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Website|title=website|last=|first=|date=|website=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|publisher=|access-date=2011-07-02}}</ref> is a collection of related web resources including [[web page]]s, [[multimedia]] content, typically identified with a common [[domain name]], and published on at least one [[web server]].

Some websites require user registration or [[subscription]] to access content. Examples of [[paywall|subscription websites]] include many business sites, news websites, [[academic journal]] websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, [[Internet forum|message boards]], web-based [[email]], [[social networking]] websites, websites providing real-time [[stock market]] data, as well as sites providing various other services. [[End user]]s can access websites on a range of devices, including [[desktop computer|desktop]] and [[laptop|laptop computers]], [[tablet computer]]s, [[smartphone]]s and [[smart TV]]s.\n\n===Browser===\n{{main|Web browser}}\nA ''web browser'' (commonly referred to as a ''browser'') is a [[software application|software]] [[user agent]] for accessing information on the World Wide Web. To connect to a website's [[web server|server]] and display its pages, a user needs to have a web browser program. This is the program that the user runs to download, format and display a web page on the user's computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/internet/difference-between-search-engine-and-browser/ |title=Difference Between Search Engine and Browser}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to allowing users to find, displaying and moving between web pages, a web browser will usually have features like keeping bookmarks, recording history, managing cookies (see below) and home pages and may have facilities for recording passwords for logging into web sites.\n\nThe most popular browsers are [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Firefox]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Internet Explorer]],<!--note IE still widely used per Market Share below so keep it here--> and [[Microsoft Edge|Edge]].\n\n===Server===\n{{main|Web server}}\n\n[[File:Inside and Rear of Webserver.jpg|thumb|right|The inside and front of a [[Dell PowerEdge]] web server, a computer designed for [[rack mount]]ing]]\nA ''Web server'' is [[server software]], or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] and several other related protocols.\n\nThe primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver [[web page]]s to [[Client (computing)|clients]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Web performance tuning|last=Patrick|first=Killelea|date=2002|publisher=O'Reilly|isbn=978-0596001728|edition= 2nd|location=Beijing|pages=264|oclc=49502686}}</ref> The communication between client and server takes place using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]]. Pages delivered are most frequently [[HTML|HTML documents]], which may include [[image]]s, [[Style sheet (web development)|style sheets]] and [[JavaScript|scripts]] in addition to the text content.\n[[File:Wikimedia Foundation Servers-8055 35.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website; here, [[Dell]] servers are installed together being used for the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].]]\n\nA [[user agent]], commonly a [[web browser]] or [[web crawler]], initiates communication by making a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request message|request]] for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an [[List of HTTP status codes#4xx Client Error|error message]] if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's [[secondary memory|secondary storage]], but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is [[Implementation|implemented]].\n\nWhile the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting [[Form (web)|web forms]], including [[upload]]ing of files.\n\nMany generic web servers also support [[server-side scripting]] using [[Active Server Pages]] (ASP), [[PHP]] (Hypertext Preprocessor), or other [[scripting language]]s. This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documents [[Dynamic web page|dynamically]] (\"on-the-fly\") as opposed to returning [[Static web page|static documents]]. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from [[database]]s. The latter is typically much faster and more easily [[web cache|cached]] but cannot deliver [[dynamic content]].\n\nWeb servers can also frequently be found [[embedded system|embedded]] in devices such as [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[webcam]]s and serving only a [[Local area network|local network]]. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required (which now is included with most [[operating system]]s).\n\n===Cookie===\n{{main|HTTP cookie}}\nAn ''HTTP cookie'' (also called ''web cookie'', ''Internet cookie'', ''browser cookie'', or simply ''cookie'') is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's [[web browser]] while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember [[program state|stateful]] information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, [[access control|logging in]], or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.\n\nCookies perform essential functions in the modern web. Perhaps most importantly, ''authentication cookies'' are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with. Without such a mechanism, the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in. The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user's [[comparison of web browsers#Vulnerabilities|web browser]], and on whether the cookie data is encrypted. Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie's data to be read by a [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]], used to gain access to user data, or used to gain access (with the user's credentials) to the website to which the cookie belongs (see [[cross-site scripting]] and [[cross-site request forgery]] for examples).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10789_3-9918582-57.html |first=Robert |last=Vamosi |title=Gmail cookie stolen via Google Spreadsheets|website=News.cnet.com |date=2008-04-14|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTracking cookies, and especially [[#Third-party cookie|third-party tracking cookies]], are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories {{En dash}} a potential [[Internet privacy#HTTP cookies|privacy concern]] that prompted European<ref>{{cite web |title=What about the \"EU Cookie Directive\"? |url=http://webcookies.org/faq/#Directive |year=2013 |publisher=WebCookies.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref> and U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011.<ref name=\"eulaw\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12668552 |work=BBC |title=New net rules set to make cookies crumble |date=2011-03-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/digital/sen-rockefeller-ready-a-real-track-bill/227426/ |work=Adage.com |title=Sen.

The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as [[search engine results page]]s (SERPs). The information may be a mix of [[web page]]s, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers and other types of files. Some search engines also [[data mining|mine data]] available in [[database]]s or [[web directory|open directories]].  Unlike [[web directories]], which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain [[real-time computing|real-time]] information by running an [[algorithm]] on a [[web crawler]].\nInternet content that is not capable of being searched by a web search engine is generally described as the [[deep web]].\n\n===Deep web===\n{{main|Deep web}}\nThe deep web,<ref name=\"nhamilton\">{{cite journal|citeseerx=10.1.1.90.5847|title=The Mechanics of a Deep Net Metasearch Engine|last=Hamilton|first=Nigel}}</ref> ''invisible web'',<ref name=\"jal\">{{cite journal|title=Beyond google: the invisible web in the academic library |volume=30|issue=4|date=July 2004|pages=265\u2013269|last1=Devine|first1=Jane|last2=Egger-Sider|first2=Francine|journal=The Journal of Academic Librarianship |doi=10.1016/j.acalib.2004.04.010 }}</ref> or ''hidden web''<ref name=\"cthw\">{{cite journal|title=Crawling the Hidden Web|journal=27th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases|date=September 11\u201314, 2001|first1=Sriram|last1=Raghavan|first2=Hector|last2=Garcia-Molina|url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/725/}}</ref> are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not [[Search engine indexing|indexed]] by standard [[web search engine]]s.

Most web browsers also implement a [[browser cache]] by writing recently obtained data to a local data storage device. HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access. Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data, such as in [[online banking]], or to facilitate frequently updated sites, such as news media. Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently. Enterprise [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of many users. Some [[search engines]] store cached content of frequently accessed websites.\n\n== Security ==\nFor [[criminal]]s, the Web has become a venue to spread [[malware]] and engage in a range of

Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable ''history'' feature, and usually [[Web cache|cache]] much of the content locally. Unless the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems. Another way to hide [[personally identifiable information]] is by using a [[VPN]]. A VPN [[encryption|encrypts]] online traffic and masks original IP address lowering the chance of user identification. When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, personally identifiable information\u2014such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc.\u2014web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website uses [[HTTP cookie]]s, username and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way it is possible for a web-based organisation to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their [[demographic profile]]. These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers, advertisers and others. Depending on the website's [[terms and conditions]] and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organisations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter terrorism, and espionage agencies can also identify, target and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.\n\n[[Social networking]] sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms, as their executives believe that this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. [[Cyberbullying|On-line bullies]] may make use of personal information to harass or [[cyberstalking|stalk]] users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners.<ref>{{cite journal|last=boyd|first=danah|author2=Hargittai, Eszter|title=Facebook privacy settings: Who cares?|journal=First Monday|date=July 2010|volume=15|issue=8|doi=10.5210/fm.v15i8.3086|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]], it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Due to image caching, mirroring and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Web standards}}\nWeb standards include many interdependent standards and specifications, some of which govern aspects of the [[Internet]], not just the World Wide Web. Even when not web-focused, such standards directly or indirectly affect the development and administration of web sites and [[web service]]s. Considerations include the [[interoperability]], [[accessibility]] and [[usability]] of web pages and web sites.\n\nWeb standards, in the broader sense, consist of the following:\n* ''Recommendations'' published by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/TR/#Recommendations |title=W3C Technical Reports and Publications | publisher=W3C | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* \"Living Standard\" made by the [[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group]] (WHATWG)\n* ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents published by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | title=IETF RFC page | publisher=IETF | accessdate=2009-01-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202124230/http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | archive-date=2 February 2009 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/search.htm?qt=world+wide+web&published=on&active_tab=standards |title=Search for World Wide Web in ISO standards | publisher=ISO | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by [[Ecma International]] (formerly ECMA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/index.html | title=Ecma formal publications  | publisher=Ecma | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''The [[Unicode]] Standard'' and various ''Unicode Technical Reports'' (UTRs) published by the [[Unicode Consortium]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/index.html | title=Unicode Technical Reports | publisher=Unicode Consortium | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* Name and number registries maintained by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iana.org/ | title=IANA home page | publisher=IANA | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n\nWeb standards are not fixed sets of rules, but are a constantly evolving set of finalized technical specifications of web technologies.<ref>{{cite book | author=Leslie Sikos | title= Web standards \u2013 Mastering HTML5, CSS3, and XML | publisher= [[Apress]] | year= 2011 | isbn= 978-1-4302-4041-9 | url= http://www.masteringhtml5css3.com/}}</ref> Web standards are developed by [[standards organization]]s\u2014groups of interested and often competing parties chartered with the task of standardization\u2014not technologies developed and declared to be a standard by a single individual or company.

In his book ''[[Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor|Weaving The Web]]'', he explains that he had repeatedly suggested to members of ''both'' technical communities that a marriage between the two technologies was possible. But, when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies:\n* a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal document identifier (UDI), later known as [[uniform resource locator]] (URL) and [[uniform resource identifier]] (URI);\n* the publishing language [[Hypertext Markup Language]] (HTML);\n* the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive: The World Wide Web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]: MIT School of Engineering|accessdate=23 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608081841/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|archivedate=8 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of ''[[link rot]]''. Unlike predecessors such as [[HyperCard]], the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|title=Ten Years Public Domain for the Original Web Software|publisher=Tenyears-www.web.cern.ch|date=30 April 2003|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813032723/http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and toward the Web.

Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become by far the most popular protocol on the Internet. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at [[INRIA]] (a French national computer research lab) with support from the [[European Commission]] DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at [[Keio University]]. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many [[List of websites founded before 1995|notable websites]] were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.\n\nConnected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the [[markup language]]s to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a [[Semantic Web]]. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format.

However, the two terms do not mean the same thing. The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], linked by hyperlinks and [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]]. Web resources are accessed using [[HTTP]] or [[HTTPS]], which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?|url=https://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=18 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422072749/http://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nViewing a [[web page]] on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the [[uniform resource locator|URL]] of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages\u2014and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks\u2014came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after [[channel surfing]]), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Muylle|first=Steve|author2=Rudy Moenaert|author3=Marc Despont|title=A grounded theory of World Wide Web search behaviour|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|year=1999|volume=5|issue=3|page=143|doi=10.1080/135272699345644|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL <code><nowiki>http://www.example.org/home.html</nowiki></code>. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (<code>www.example.org</code>) into an [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] using the globally distributed [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as ''203.0.113.4'' or ''2001:db8:2e::7334''. The browser then requests the resource by sending an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing.  The HTTP protocol normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 80]] and for HTTPS protocol it normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 443]]. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nGET /home.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.org\n</source>\n\nThe computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n</source>\n\nfollowed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language ([[HTML]]) for a basic web page might look like this:\n<source lang=\"html\">\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>www.Example.org \u2013 The World Wide Web</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThe web browser [[parsing|parses]] the HTML and interprets the markup (<source lang=\"html\" inline><title></source>, <source lang=\"HTML\" inline><p></source> for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, [[Client-side scripting|scripts]] that affect page behaviour, and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other [[Internet media type]]s. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively [[Browser engine|renders]] the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.\n\n=== HTML ===\n{{main|HTML}}\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard [[markup language]] for creating [[web page]]s and [[web application]]s. With [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) and [[JavaScript]], it forms a triad of [[cornerstone]] technologies for the World Wide Web.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flanagan|first1=David|title=JavaScript \u2013 The definitive guide|page=1|edition=6|quote=JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all Web developers must learn: HTML to specify the content of web pages, CSS to specify the presentation of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the behaviour of web pages.}}</ref>\n\n[[Web browser]]s receive HTML documents from a [[web server]] or from local storage and [[browser engine|render]] the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page [[Semantic Web|semantically]] and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\n\n[[HTML element]]s are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, [[HTML element#Images and objects|images]] and other objects such as [[Fieldset|interactive forms]] may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create [[structured document]]s by denoting structural [[semantics]] for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, [[Hyperlink|links]], quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by ''tags'', written using [[Bracket#Angle brackets|angle brackets]]. Tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<img />}} and {{code|lang=html|<input />}} directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<p>}} surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.\n\nHTML can embed programs written in a [[scripting language]] such as [[JavaScript]], which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML {{as of|1997|lc=y|since=y|post=.}}<ref name=\"deprecated\">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40-971218/conform.html#deprecated|title=HTML 4.0 Specification \u2013 W3C Recommendation \u2013 Conformance: requirements and recommendations|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=December 18, 1997|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Linking ===\nMost web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:\n<source lang=\"html\" inline><a href=\"http://www.example.org/home.html\">www.Example.org Homepage</a></source>\n[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]\nSuch a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a ''web'' of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the ''WorldWideWeb'' (in its original [[CamelCase]], which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.<ref name=\"W90\" />\n\nThe hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the [[webgraph]]: the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called [[dead link]]s. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites. The [[Internet Archive]], active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.\n\n=== WWW prefix ===\n<!-- WWW prefix redirects here -->\nMany hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with ''www'' because of the long-standing practice of naming [[Internet]] hosts according to the services they provide. The [[hostname]] of a [[web server]] is often ''www'', in the same way that it may be ''ftp'' for an [[FTP server]], and ''news'' or ''nntp'' for a [[Usenet]] [[news server]]. These host names appear as Domain Name System (DNS) or [[subdomain]] names, as in ''www.example.com''. The use of ''www'' is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it; the first web server was ''nxoc01.cern.ch''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|title=Frequently asked questions by the Press|first=Tim|last=Berners-Lee|publisher=W3C|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802051415/http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|archivedate=2 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to Paolo Palazzi,<ref>Palazzi, P (2011) [http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays 'The Early Days of the WWW at CERN'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723105704/http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays |date=23 July 2012 }}</ref> who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of ''www'' as subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page, however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prepending ''www'' to an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as ''www2'', ''secure'' or ''en'' for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the ''www'' subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful for [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] incoming web traffic by creating a [[CNAME record]] that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-cant-a-domain-s-root-be-a-cname-8cbab38e5f5c |title=Why a domain's root can't be a CNAME \u2013 and other tidbits about the DNS |author=Dominic Fraser |date=May 13, 2018 |work=FreeCodeCamp}}</ref>{{Dubious |reason=While CNAMEs are more flexible than the bare domain requiring an A Record, load balancing is certainly possible even for sites that skip www and use the bare domain \u2014 see, for example, Twitter.|date=July 2019}}\n\nWhen a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix \"www\" to the beginning of it and possibly \".com\", \".org\" and \".net\" at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering '{{not a typo|microsoft}}' may be transformed to ''<nowiki>http://www.microsoft.com/</nowiki>'' and 'openoffice' to ''<nowiki>http://www.openoffice.org</nowiki>''.

They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web, and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data, such as passwords or banking information. Web browsers usually automatically prepend <nowiki>http://</nowiki> to user-entered URIs, if omitted.\n\n===Pages===\n{{main|Web page}}\n[[File:Commons.png|thumb|A screenshot of a web page on Wikimedia Commons]]\nA ''web page'' (also written as ''webpage'') is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and [[web browser]]s. A web browser displays a web page on a [[computer display|monitor]] or [[mobile device]].\n\nThe term ''web page'' usually refers to what is visible, but may also refer to the contents of the [[computer file]] itself, which is usually a [[text file]] containing [[hypertext]] written in [[HTML]] or a comparable [[markup language]]. Typical web pages provide [[hypertext]] for browsing to other web pages via [[hyperlink]]s, often referred to as ''links''. Web browsers will frequently have to access multiple [[web resource]] elements, such as reading [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheets]], [[client-side scripting|scripts]], and images, while presenting each web page.\n\nOn a network, a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote [[web server]]. The web server may restrict access to a private network such as a corporate intranet. The web browser uses the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) to make such requests to the [[web server]].\n\nA [[static web page|''static'' web page]] is delivered exactly as stored, as [[web content]] in the web server's [[file system]]. In contrast, a [[dynamic web page|''dynamic'' web page]] is generated by a [[web application]], usually driven by [[server-side scripting|server-side software]]. Dynamic web pages are used when each user may require completely different information, for example, bank websites, web email etc.\n\n==== Static page ====\n{{main|Static web page}}\nA ''static web page'' (sometimes called a ''flat page/stationary page'') is a [[web page]] that is delivered to the user exactly as stored, in contrast to [[dynamic web page]]s which are generated by a [[web application]].\n\nConsequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a [[web server]] to [[content negotiation|negotiate]] [[MIME type|content-type]] or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.\n\n==== Dynamic pages ====\n{{Main|Dynamic web page|Ajax (programming)}}\n[[File:Scheme dynamic page en.svg|thumb|right|500px|Dynamic web page: example of server-side scripting ([[PHP]] and [[MySQL]]).]]\nA ''server-side dynamic web page'' is a [[web page]] whose construction is controlled by an [[application server]] processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nA ''client-side dynamic web page'' processes the web page using [[HTML scripting]] running in the browser as it loads.  JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the [[Document Object Model]], or DOM, that represents the loaded web page.  The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.\n\nA dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a [[computer program]] to change some variable content.  The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a ''dynamic web page update'' using [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the [[web browsing history]] forward of the displayed page.  Using Ajax technologies the end [[User (computing)|user]] gets ''one dynamic page'' managed as a single page in the [[web browser]] while the actual [[web content]] rendered on that page can vary.  The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, ''the'' DOM, for its client, from an application server.\n\n[[DHTML]] is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not [[static web page]]s, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]], a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.\n\n[[JavaScript]] is a [[scripting programming language|scripting language]] that was initially developed in 1995 by [[Brendan Eich]], then of [[Netscape]], for use within web pages.<ref name=Hamilton>{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Naomi|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript|url=http://computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|date=31 July 2008|work=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=12 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524025720/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|archivedate=24 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The standardised version is [[ECMAScript]].<ref name=Hamilton /> To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] ([[Asynchronous I/O|asynchronous]] JavaScript and [[XML]]). [[Client-side scripting|Client-side script]] is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularly [[polling (computer science)|poll]] the server to check whether new information is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|title=jQuery Polling plugin|date=23 September 2008|last=Buntin|first=Seth|accessdate=2009-08-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813184848/http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Website===\n[[File:United States Antarctic Program website from 2018 02 22.png|thumb|right|240px|The [[United States Antarctic Program|usap.gov]] website]]\n{{main|website}}\nA ''website''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Website|title=website|last=|first=|date=|website=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|publisher=|access-date=2011-07-02}}</ref> is a collection of related web resources including [[web page]]s, [[multimedia]] content, typically identified with a common [[domain name]], and published on at least one [[web server]]. Notable examples are [[wikipedia]].org, [[google]].com, and [[Amazon (company)|amazon.com]].\n\nA website may be accessible via a public [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network, such as the [[Internet]], or a private [[local area network]] (LAN), by referencing a [[URL|uniform resource locator]] (URL) that identifies the site.\n\nWebsites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a [[personal website]], a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and [[social networking]] to providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically a part of an [[intranet]].\n\nWeb pages, which are the building blocks of websites, are [[document]]s, typically composed in [[plain text]] interspersed with formatting instructions of Hypertext Markup Language ([[HTML]], [[XHTML]]). They may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable [[HTML anchor|markup anchors]]. Web pages are accessed and transported with the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), which may optionally employ encryption ([[HTTP Secure]], HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the user. The user's application, often a [[web browser]], renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto a [[Computer monitor|display terminal]].\n\n[[Hyperlink]]ing between web pages conveys to the reader the [[site map|site structure]] and guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a [[home page]] containing a directory of the site [[web content]]. Some websites require user registration or [[subscription]] to access content. Examples of [[paywall|subscription websites]] include many business sites, news websites, [[academic journal]] websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, [[Internet forum|message boards]], web-based [[email]], [[social networking]] websites, websites providing real-time [[stock market]] data, as well as sites providing various other services. [[End user]]s can access websites on a range of devices, including [[desktop computer|desktop]] and [[laptop|laptop computers]], [[tablet computer]]s, [[smartphone]]s and [[smart TV]]s.\n\n===Browser===\n{{main|Web browser}}\nA ''web browser'' (commonly referred to as a ''browser'') is a [[software application|software]] [[user agent]] for accessing information on the World Wide Web. To connect to a website's [[web server|server]] and display its pages, a user needs to have a web browser program. This is the program that the user runs to download, format and display a web page on the user's computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/internet/difference-between-search-engine-and-browser/ |title=Difference Between Search Engine and Browser}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to allowing users to find, displaying and moving between web pages, a web browser will usually have features like keeping bookmarks, recording history, managing cookies (see below) and home pages and may have facilities for recording passwords for logging into web sites.\n\nThe most popular browsers are [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Firefox]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Internet Explorer]],<!--note IE still widely used per Market Share below so keep it here--> and [[Microsoft Edge|Edge]].\n\n===Server===\n{{main|Web server}}\n\n[[File:Inside and Rear of Webserver.jpg|thumb|right|The inside and front of a [[Dell PowerEdge]] web server, a computer designed for [[rack mount]]ing]]\nA ''Web server'' is [[server software]], or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] and several other related protocols.\n\nThe primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver [[web page]]s to [[Client (computing)|clients]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Web performance tuning|last=Patrick|first=Killelea|date=2002|publisher=O'Reilly|isbn=978-0596001728|edition= 2nd|location=Beijing|pages=264|oclc=49502686}}</ref> The communication between client and server takes place using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]]. Pages delivered are most frequently [[HTML|HTML documents]], which may include [[image]]s, [[Style sheet (web development)|style sheets]] and [[JavaScript|scripts]] in addition to the text content.\n[[File:Wikimedia Foundation Servers-8055 35.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website; here, [[Dell]] servers are installed together being used for the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].]]\n\nA [[user agent]], commonly a [[web browser]] or [[web crawler]], initiates communication by making a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request message|request]] for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an [[List of HTTP status codes#4xx Client Error|error message]] if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's [[secondary memory|secondary storage]], but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is [[Implementation|implemented]].\n\nWhile the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting [[Form (web)|web forms]], including [[upload]]ing of files.\n\nMany generic web servers also support [[server-side scripting]] using [[Active Server Pages]] (ASP), [[PHP]] (Hypertext Preprocessor), or other [[scripting language]]s. This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documents [[Dynamic web page|dynamically]] (\"on-the-fly\") as opposed to returning [[Static web page|static documents]]. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from [[database]]s. The latter is typically much faster and more easily [[web cache|cached]] but cannot deliver [[dynamic content]].\n\nWeb servers can also frequently be found [[embedded system|embedded]] in devices such as [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[webcam]]s and serving only a [[Local area network|local network]]. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required (which now is included with most [[operating system]]s).\n\n===Cookie===\n{{main|HTTP cookie}}\nAn ''HTTP cookie'' (also called ''web cookie'', ''Internet cookie'', ''browser cookie'', or simply ''cookie'') is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's [[web browser]] while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember [[program state|stateful]] information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, [[access control|logging in]], or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.\n\nCookies perform essential functions in the modern web. Perhaps most importantly, ''authentication cookies'' are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with. Without such a mechanism, the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in. The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user's [[comparison of web browsers#Vulnerabilities|web browser]], and on whether the cookie data is encrypted. Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie's data to be read by a [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]], used to gain access to user data, or used to gain access (with the user's credentials) to the website to which the cookie belongs (see [[cross-site scripting]] and [[cross-site request forgery]] for examples).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10789_3-9918582-57.html |first=Robert |last=Vamosi |title=Gmail cookie stolen via Google Spreadsheets|website=News.cnet.com |date=2008-04-14|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTracking cookies, and especially [[#Third-party cookie|third-party tracking cookies]], are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories {{En dash}} a potential [[Internet privacy#HTTP cookies|privacy concern]] that prompted European<ref>{{cite web |title=What about the \"EU Cookie Directive\"? |url=http://webcookies.org/faq/#Directive |year=2013 |publisher=WebCookies.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref> and U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011.<ref name=\"eulaw\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12668552 |work=BBC |title=New net rules set to make cookies crumble |date=2011-03-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/digital/sen-rockefeller-ready-a-real-track-bill/227426/ |work=Adage.com |title=Sen.

Most web browsers also implement a [[browser cache]] by writing recently obtained data to a local data storage device. HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access. Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data, such as in [[online banking]], or to facilitate frequently updated sites, such as news media. Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently. Enterprise [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of many users. Some [[search engines]] store cached content of frequently accessed websites.\n\n== Security ==\nFor [[criminal]]s, the Web has become a venue to spread [[malware]] and engage in a range of [[cybercrime]]s, including (but not limited to) [[identity theft]], [[fraud]], [[espionage]] and [[intelligence gathering]].<ref name=Ben-Itzhak /> Web-based [[vulnerability

Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable ''history'' feature, and usually [[Web cache|cache]] much of the content locally. Unless the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems. Another way to hide [[personally identifiable information]] is by using a [[VPN]]. A VPN [[encryption|encrypts]] online traffic and masks original IP address lowering the chance of user identification. When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, personally identifiable information\u2014such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc.\u2014web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website uses [[HTTP cookie]]s, username and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way it is possible for a web-based organisation to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their [[demographic profile]]. These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers, advertisers and others. Depending on the website's [[terms and conditions]] and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organisations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter terrorism, and espionage agencies can also identify, target and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.\n\n[[Social networking]] sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms, as their executives believe that this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. [[Cyberbullying|On-line bullies]] may make use of personal information to harass or [[cyberstalking|stalk]] users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners.<ref>{{cite journal|last=boyd|first=danah|author2=Hargittai, Eszter|title=Facebook privacy settings: Who cares?|journal=First Monday|date=July 2010|volume=15|issue=8|doi=10.5210/fm.v15i8.3086|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]], it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Due to image caching, mirroring and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Web standards}}\nWeb standards include many interdependent standards and specifications, some of which govern aspects of the [[Internet]], not just the World Wide Web. Even when not web-focused, such standards directly or indirectly affect the development and administration of web sites and [[web service]]s. Considerations include the [[interoperability]], [[accessibility]] and [[usability]] of web pages and web sites.\n\nWeb standards, in the broader sense, consist of the following:\n* ''Recommendations'' published by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/TR/#Recommendations |title=W3C Technical Reports and Publications | publisher=W3C | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* \"Living Standard\" made by the [[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group]] (WHATWG)\n* ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents published by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | title=IETF RFC page | publisher=IETF | accessdate=2009-01-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202124230/http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | archive-date=2 February 2009 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/search.htm?qt=world+wide+web&published=on&active_tab=standards |title=Search for World Wide Web in ISO standards | publisher=ISO | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by [[Ecma International]] (formerly ECMA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/index.html | title=Ecma formal publications  | publisher=Ecma | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''The [[Unicode]] Standard'' and various ''Unicode Technical Reports'' (UTRs) published by the [[Unicode Consortium]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/index.html | title=Unicode Technical Reports | publisher=Unicode Consortium | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* Name and number registries maintained by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iana.org/ | title=IANA home page | publisher=IANA | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n\nWeb standards are not fixed sets of rules, but are a constantly evolving set of finalized technical specifications of web technologies.<ref>{{cite book | author=Leslie Sikos | title= Web standards \u2013 Mastering HTML5, CSS3, and XML | publisher= [[Apress]] | year= 2011 | isbn= 978-1-4302-4041-9 | url= http://www.masteringhtml5css3.com/}}</ref> Web standards are developed by [[standards organization]]s\u2014groups of interested and often competing parties chartered with the task of standardization\u2014not technologies developed and declared to be a standard by a single individual or company.

Variations of drug liberalization include: '''drug legalization''', '''drug relegalization''' and '''drug decriminalization'''.<ref>[https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/committee/371/ille/03evb-e Proceedings of the Special Committee on Illegal Drugs], Senate of Canada, 28 May 2001</ref>\n\n== Policies ==\nThe 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] made it mandatory for the signatory countries to \"adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law\" (art. 3, \u00a7&nbsp;1) all the activities related to the production, sale, transport, distribution, etc. of the substances included in the most restricted lists of the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. Criminalization also applies to the \"cultivation of opium poppy, coca bush or cannabis plants for the purpose of the production of narcotic drugs\". The Convention distinguishes between the intent to traffic and personal consumption, stating that the latter should also be considered a criminal offence, but \"subject to the constitutional principles and the basic concepts of [the state\u2019s] legal system\" (art. 3, \u00a7&nbsp;2).<ref name=reform>[https://www.tni.org/en/paper/drug-policy-reform-practice Drug Policy Reform in Practice: Experiences with alternatives in Europe and the US], Tom Blickman & Martin Jelsma, Transnational Institute, July 2009.</ref>\n\nThe [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (EMCDDA) defines decriminalization as the removal of a conduct or activity from the sphere of criminal law; depenalisation signifying merely a relaxation of the penal sanction exacted by law. Decriminalization usually applies to offences related to drug consumption and may include either the imposition of sanctions of a different kind (administrative) or the abolition of all sanctions; other (noncriminal) laws then regulate the conduct or activity that has been decriminalized. Depenalisation usually consists of personal consumption as well as small-scale trading and generally signifies the elimination or reduction of custodial penalties, while the conduct or activity still remains a criminal offence. The term legalization refers to the removal of all drug-related offences from criminal law: use, possession, cultivation, production, trading, etc.<ref name=reform /><ref name=emcdda>[http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_10080_EN_EMCDDATP_01.pdf Illicit drug use in the EU: legislative approaches], EMCDDA thematic papers, Lisbon 2005</ref>\n\nDrug liberalization proponents hold differing reasons to support liberalization, and have differing policy proposals. The two most common positions are '''drug legalization''' (or re-legalization), and '''drug decriminalization'''.\n\n=== Drug legalization ===\nDrug legalization calls for a return to the pre-20th century situation in which almost all drugs were legal. This would require ending government-enforced prohibition on the distribution or sale and personal use of specified (or all) currently banned drugs. Proposed ideas range from full legalization which would completely remove all forms of government control, to various forms of regulated legalization, where drugs would be legally available, but under a system of government control which might mean for instance:<ref>[http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (12 Nov 2009)</ref>\n* Mandated labels with dosage and medical warnings.\n* Restrictions on advertising.\n* Age limitations.\n* Restrictions on amount purchased at one time.\n* Requirements on the form in which certain drugs would be supplied.\n* Ban on sale to intoxicated persons.\n* Special user licenses to purchase particular drugs.\n* A possible clinical setting for the consumption of some intravenous drugs and/or supervised consumption. \nThe regulated legalization system would probably have a range of restrictions for different drugs, depending on their perceived risk, so while some drugs would be sold over the counter in pharmacies or other licensed establishments, drugs with greater risks of harm might only be available for sale on licensed premises where use could be monitored and emergency medical care made available. Examples of drugs with different levels of regulated distribution in most countries include: caffeine (coffee, tea), nicotine (tobacco),<ref>[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2010/02/regulation-saves-lives.html Tobacco regulation: Saving livings vs personal freedom], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (3 Feb 2010)</ref> and ethyl alcohol (beer, wine, spirits).\n\nFull legalization is often proposed by groups such as [[libertarians]] who object to drug laws on moral grounds, while regulated legalization is suggested by groups such as [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]] who object to the drug laws on the grounds that they fail to achieve their stated aims and instead greatly worsen the problems associated with use of prohibited drugs, but who acknowledge that there are harms associated with currently prohibited drugs which need to be minimized. Not all proponents of drug re-legalization necessarily share a common ethical framework, and people may adopt this viewpoint for a variety of reasons. In particular, favoring drug legalization does not imply approval of drug use.<ref>[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2009/12/reformers-are-not-pro-drug-mr-costa.html Reformers and not 'pro-drug' Mr Costa], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (7 Dec 2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/portugal-drug-policy-decriminalization-works-2012-7 Portugal Decriminalized All Drugs Eleven Years Ago And The Results Are Staggering], [[Business Insider]] (17 Jul 2012)</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Boaz|first1=David|title=Let's Quit the Drug War|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/lets-quit-drug-war|website=Cato Institute|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=en|date=17 March 1988|quote=This article originally appeared in the New York Times on March 17, 1988}}</ref>\n\n=== Drug decriminalization ===\nDrug decriminalization calls for reduced control and penalties compared to existing laws. Proponents of drug decriminalization generally support the use of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] or other punishments to replace [[prison]] terms, and often propose systems whereby illegal drug users who are caught would be fined, but would not receive a permanent criminal record as a result. A central feature of drug decriminalization is the concept of [[harm reduction]].\n\nDrug decriminalization is in some ways an intermediate between prohibition and legalization, and has been criticized as being \"the worst of both worlds\", in that drug sales would still be illegal, thus perpetuating the problems associated with leaving production and distribution of drugs to the criminal underworld, while also failing to discourage illegal drug use by removing the criminal penalties that might otherwise cause some people to choose not to use drugs. However, there are many that argue that the decriminalization of possession of drugs would redirect focus of the law enforcement system of any country to put more effort into arresting dealers and big time criminals, instead of arresting minor criminals for mere possession, and thus be more effective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 2001 Portugal began treating use and possession of small quantities of drugs as a public health issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/|title=Why hardly anyone dies from a drug overdose in Portugal|last=https://www.facebook.com/chrisingraham|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}</ref> This means that, rather than incarcerating those in possession, they are referred to a treatment program. The drugs are still illegal, the police just handles the situation differently. This also decreases the amount of money the government spends fighting a war on drugs and money spent keeping drug users incarcerated.\n\"As noted by the EMCDDA, across Europe in the last decades, there has been a movement toward \"an approach that distinguishes between the drug traf\ufb01cker, who is viewed as a criminal, and the drug user, who is seen more as a sick person who is in need of treatment\" (EMCDDA 2008, 22).6 A number of Latin American countries have similarly moved to reduce the penalties associated with drug use and personal possession\" (Laqueur, 2015, p.&nbsp;748).\n[[Portugal]] is the first country that has decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs, to positive results.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html | work=Time | first=Maia | last=Szalavitz | title=Drugs in Portugal: Did Decriminalization Work? | date=26 April 2009}}</ref> Anyone caught with any type of drug in Portugal, if it is for personal consumption, will not be imprisoned.\n\n== Economics ==\nThere are numerous economic and social impacts of the criminalization of drugs. Prohibition increases crime (theft, violence, corruption) and drug price and increases potency.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last = Thornton\n  | first = Mark\n  | title = The Economics of Prohibition\n  | url=http://mises.org/story/2269\n   | date = 2006-07-31\n  }}</ref> In many developing countries the production of drugs offers a way to escape poverty. [[Milton Friedman]] estimated that over 10,000 deaths a year in the US are caused by the criminalization of drugs, and if drugs were to be made legal innocent victims such as those shot down in drive by shootings, would cease or decrease. The economic inefficiency and ineffectiveness of such government intervention in preventing drug trade has been fiercely criticised by drug-liberty advocates. The [[War on Drugs]] of the United States, that provoked legislation within several other Western governments, has also garnered criticism for these reasons.\n\n=== Prices and consumption ===\nMuch of the debate surrounding the economics of drug legalization centers on the shape of the demand curve for illegal drugs and the sensitivity of consumers to changes in the prices of illegal drugs.<ref name=Clark>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Andrew E.|title=The Economics of Drug Legalization|url=http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809060914/http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|url-status=live|archive-date=2011-08-09|accessdate=2016-12-10}}</ref> Proponents of drug legalization often assume that the quantity of addictive drugs consumed is unresponsive to changes in price; however, studies into addictive, but legal, substances like alcohol and cigarettes, have shown that consumption can be quite responsive to changes in prices.<ref name=Grossman>{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Michael|author2=Frank J.

Levitt]] and Ilyana Kuziemko point to the over crowding of prisons as another negative side effect of the war on drugs. They believe that by sending such a large number of drug offenders to prison, the war on drugs has reduced the prison space available for other offenders. This increased incarceration rate not only costs tax payers more to maintain, it could possibly increase crime by crowding violent offenders out of prison cells and replacing them with drug offenders.<ref name=\"Levitt\" />{{rp|2043}}\n\n=== Direct costs ===\nA [[Harvard University|Harvard]] economist, [[Jeffrey Miron]], estimated that ending the war on drugs would inject 76.8 billion dollars into the US economy in 2010 alone.<ref name=Bernd>{{cite news|last=Debusmann|first=Bernd|title=Einstein, Insanity and the War on Drugs|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2008/12/03/einstein-insanity-and-the-war-on-drugs/|accessdate=4/1/12|newspaper=Reuter|date=12/3/08}}</ref> He estimates that the government would save $41.3 billion for law enforcement and the government would gain up to $46.7 billion in tax revenue.<ref name=Cato>{{cite journal|last=Miron|first=Jeffrey A.|author2=Katherine Waldock|title=The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition|journal=The Cato Institute|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/budgetary-impact-ending-drug-prohibition|date=2010-09-27}}</ref>\n\nSince the war on drugs began under the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|administration]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], the federal drug-fighting budget has increased from $100 million in 1970 to $15.1 billion in 2010, with a total cost estimated near 1 trillion dollars over 40 years.

In the 20th century, the United States government led a major renewed surge in drug prohibition called the \"[[War on Drugs]].\" It was only in the 20th Century that Britain and the United States outlawed cannabis. The British had gone to war with China in the 19th Century in what became known as the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s to protect their valuable trade in narcotics.\n\nMotivations claimed by supporters of drug prohibition laws across various societies and eras have included [[religious observance]], allegations of violence by [[racial minorities]], and [[public health]] concerns. Those who are not proponents of anti-drug legislation characterize these motivations as [[religious intolerance]], [[racism]], and [[public healthism]].\n\nVarious proponents of drug liberalization wish to repeal these laws for [[Arguments for and against drug prohibition|reasons]] ranging from [[individual rights]]-based defenses of [[liberty]], to [[consequentialist]] arguments against the economic and social outcomes of drug prohibition. Starting in the 20th century, large organized movements to overturn existing drug laws formed around the world. The most vocal of these groups exist in [[liberal democracies]], and typically attract [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] supporters, although drug liberalization itself is a non-partisan issue and may be supported by adherents of any ideology.\n\nThe campaign against [[alcohol prohibition]] culminated in the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] repealing prohibition on 5 December 1933, as well as liberalization in [[Canada]], and some but not all of the other countries that enforced prohibition. However, many laws controlling the use of alcohol continue to exist even in these countries.\n\nCurrent proponents of drug liberalization seek the repeal or softening of drug prohibition laws, most commonly [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] but also including other [[controlled substance]]s such as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[opiate]]s, [[stimulant]]s, [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], [[dissociative]]s, [[prescription drug]]s, and others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Policies by country ==\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Thailand====\nAlthough [[Thailand]] has a strict [[drug policy]], in May 2018, the Cabinet approved draft legislation that allows for more research into the effects of marijuana on people. Thus, the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) will soon begin clinical trials of marijuana as a preliminary step in the production of drugs from this plant.

According to the regulation, a person could possess up to 15&nbsp;grams of marijuana or 1.5&nbsp;grams of heroin without facing criminal charges.

The court considered that basing a decision on mere Regulation would be unconstitutional and in breach of Article 39 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms|Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms]] which states that \"''only a law may designate which acts constitute a crime and what penalties, or other detriments to rights or property, may be imposed for committing them''\" and proposed to the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]] to abolish the Regulation. In line with the District Courts' argument, the Constitutional Court abolished the Regulation effective from 23 August 2013, noting that the \"''amount larger than small''\" within the meaning of the Criminal Code may be designated only by the means of an Act of Parliament, and not a Governmental Regulation. Moreover, the Constitutional Court further noted that the Regulation merely took over already existing judicial practice of interpretation of what constitutes \"''amount larger than small''\" and thus its abolishment will not really change the criminality of drug possession in the country.<ref name=\"concourt\">{{Citation\n| last       = Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic\n| year       = 2013\n| title      = Ruling No. 259/2013 Coll.\n| publisher  =\n| location = Brno\n| page       =\n| url        =\n| accessdate =\n| language   = Czech\n}}</ref> Thus, the above-mentioned amounts from the now-not-effective Regulation remain as the base for consideration of police and prosecutors, while courts are not bound by the precise grammage.\n\nSale of any amount (not purchase) remains a criminal act.

The reform titled \"From punishment to help\" was approved by the Norwegian government in 2017 and is now in the final phase of approval by the parliament. Changes are expected to be implemented by early 2021. The new reform policy emphasizes that criminalizing drug use has no significant effect on rates of drug consumption and that drug addiction is better dealt with by health care services, hence the slogan \"from punishment to help\". Instead of fines or prison time, a person caught with a drug quantity for personal use will now be met with an independent panel consisting of social and health care workers that will discuss administrative sanctions or addiction treatment methods. This will hopefully encourage problematic users to seek help rather than fear of prosecution. There is also hope that this will improve the relationship between drug users and law enforcement officers. Opponents of the reform, including the police force and the progress party, fear that drug use will increase once a person is no longer at risk of facing criminal charges.  <ref> https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/hod/org/styrer-rad-og-utvalg/rusreformutvalget/id2594880</ref>\n\n==== Portugal ====\n{{Main|Drug policy of Portugal}}\nIn 2001, [[Portugal]] became the first European country to abolish all criminal penalties for personal drug possession, under Law 30/2000.<ref>{{cite\n|first = Alex\n|last = Stevens\n|title = The effects of decriminalization of drug use in Portugal\n|date = 2007\n|url = https://kar.kent.ac.uk/13325/\n}}</ref> In addition, drug users were to be provided with [[Drug therapy|therapy]] rather than prison sentences.

Proposed ideas range from full legalization which would completely remove all forms of government control, to various forms of regulated legalization, where drugs would be legally available, but under a system of government control which might mean for instance:<ref>[http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (12 Nov 2009)</ref>\n* Mandated labels with dosage and medical warnings.\n* Restrictions on advertising.\n* Age limitations.\n* Restrictions on amount purchased at one time.\n* Requirements on the form in which certain drugs would be supplied.\n* Ban on sale to intoxicated persons.\n* Special user licenses to purchase particular drugs.\n* A possible clinical setting for the consumption of some intravenous drugs and/or supervised consumption. \nThe regulated legalization system would probably have a range of restrictions for different drugs, depending on their perceived risk, so while some drugs would be sold over the counter in pharmacies or other licensed establishments, drugs with greater risks of harm might only be available for sale on licensed premises where use could be monitored and emergency medical care made available. Examples of drugs with different levels of regulated distribution in most countries include: caffeine (coffee, tea), nicotine (tobacco),<ref>[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2010/02/regulation-saves-lives.html Tobacco regulation: Saving livings vs personal freedom], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (3 Feb 2010)</ref> and ethyl alcohol (beer, wine, spirits).\n\nFull legalization is often proposed by groups such as [[libertarians]] who object to drug laws on moral grounds, while regulated legalization is suggested by groups such as [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]] who object to the drug laws on the grounds that they fail to achieve their stated aims and instead greatly worsen the problems associated with use of prohibited drugs, but who acknowledge that there are harms associated with currently prohibited drugs which need to be minimized. Not all proponents of drug re-legalization necessarily share a common ethical framework, and people may adopt this viewpoint for a variety of reasons. In particular, favoring drug legalization does not imply approval of drug use.<ref>[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2009/12/reformers-are-not-pro-drug-mr-costa.html Reformers and not 'pro-drug' Mr Costa], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (7 Dec 2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/portugal-drug-policy-decriminalization-works-2012-7 Portugal Decriminalized All Drugs Eleven Years Ago And The Results Are Staggering], [[Business Insider]] (17 Jul 2012)</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Boaz|first1=David|title=Let's Quit the Drug War|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/lets-quit-drug-war|website=Cato Institute|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=en|date=17 March 1988|quote=This article originally appeared in the New York Times on March 17, 1988}}</ref>\n\n=== Drug decriminalization ===\nDrug decriminalization calls for reduced control and penalties compared to existing laws. Proponents of drug decriminalization generally support the use of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] or other punishments to replace [[prison]] terms, and often propose systems whereby illegal drug users who are caught would be fined, but would not receive a permanent criminal record as a result. A central feature of drug decriminalization is the concept of [[harm reduction]].\n\nDrug decriminalization is in some ways an intermediate between prohibition and legalization, and has been criticized as being \"the worst of both worlds\", in that drug sales would still be illegal, thus perpetuating the problems associated with leaving production and distribution of drugs to the criminal underworld, while also failing to discourage illegal drug use by removing the criminal penalties that might otherwise cause some people to choose not to use drugs. However, there are many that argue that the decriminalization of possession of drugs would redirect focus of the law enforcement system of any country to put more effort into arresting dealers and big time criminals, instead of arresting minor criminals for mere possession, and thus be more effective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 2001 Portugal began treating use and possession of small quantities of drugs as a public health issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/|title=Why hardly anyone dies from a drug overdose in Portugal|last=https://www.facebook.com/chrisingraham|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}</ref> This means that, rather than incarcerating those in possession, they are referred to a treatment program. The drugs are still illegal, the police just handles the situation differently. This also decreases the amount of money the government spends fighting a war on drugs and money spent keeping drug users incarcerated.\n\"As noted by the EMCDDA, across Europe in the last decades, there has been a movement toward \"an approach that distinguishes between the drug traf\ufb01cker, who is viewed as a criminal, and the drug user, who is seen more as a sick person who is in need of treatment\" (EMCDDA 2008, 22).6 A number of Latin American countries have similarly moved to reduce the penalties associated with drug use and personal possession\" (Laqueur, 2015, p.&nbsp;748).\n[[Portugal]] is the first country that has decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs, to positive results.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html | work=Time | first=Maia | last=Szalavitz | title=Drugs in Portugal: Did Decriminalization Work? | date=26 April 2009}}</ref> Anyone caught with any type of drug in Portugal, if it is for personal consumption, will not be imprisoned.\n\n== Economics ==\nThere are numerous economic and social impacts of the criminalization of drugs.

[[Milton Friedman]] estimated that over 10,000 deaths a year in the US are caused by the criminalization of drugs, and if drugs were to be made legal innocent victims such as those shot down in drive by shootings, would cease or decrease. The economic inefficiency and ineffectiveness of such government intervention in preventing drug trade has been fiercely criticised by drug-liberty advocates. The [[War on Drugs]] of the United States, that provoked legislation within several other Western governments, has also garnered criticism for these reasons.\n\n=== Prices and consumption ===\nMuch of the debate surrounding the economics of drug legalization centers on the shape of the demand curve for illegal drugs and the sensitivity of consumers to changes in the prices of illegal drugs.<ref name=Clark>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Andrew E.|title=The Economics of Drug Legalization|url=http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809060914/http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|url-status=live|archive-date=2011-08-09|accessdate=2016-12-10}}</ref> Proponents of drug legalization often assume that the quantity of addictive drugs consumed is unresponsive to changes in price; however, studies into addictive, but legal, substances like alcohol and cigarettes, have shown that consumption can be quite responsive to changes in prices.<ref name=Grossman>{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Michael|author2=Frank J.

This increased incarceration rate not only costs tax payers more to maintain, it could possibly increase crime by crowding violent offenders out of prison cells and replacing them with drug offenders.<ref name=\"Levitt\" />{{rp|2043}}\n\n=== Direct costs ===\nA [[Harvard University|Harvard]] economist, [[Jeffrey Miron]], estimated that ending the war on drugs would inject 76.8 billion dollars into the US economy in 2010 alone.<ref name=Bernd>{{cite news|last=Debusmann|first=Bernd|title=Einstein, Insanity and the War on Drugs|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2008/12/03/einstein-insanity-and-the-war-on-drugs/|accessdate=4/1/12|newspaper=Reuter|date=12/3/08}}</ref> He estimates that the government would save $41.3 billion for law enforcement and the government would gain up to $46.7 billion in tax revenue.<ref name=Cato>{{cite journal|last=Miron|first=Jeffrey A.|author2=Katherine Waldock|title=The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition|journal=The Cato Institute|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/budgetary-impact-ending-drug-prohibition|date=2010-09-27}}</ref>\n\nSince the war on drugs began under the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|administration]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], the federal drug-fighting budget has increased from $100 million in 1970 to $15.1 billion in 2010, with a total cost estimated near 1 trillion dollars over 40 years.

In the 20th century, the United States government led a major renewed surge in drug prohibition called the \"[[War on Drugs]].\" It was only in the 20th Century that Britain and the United States outlawed cannabis. The British had gone to war with China in the 19th Century in what became known as the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s to protect their valuable trade in narcotics.\n\nMotivations claimed by supporters of drug prohibition laws across various societies and eras have included [[religious observance]], allegations of violence by [[racial minorities]], and [[public health]] concerns. Those who are not proponents of anti-drug legislation characterize these motivations as [[religious intolerance]], [[racism]], and [[public healthism]].\n\nVarious proponents of drug liberalization wish to repeal these laws for [[Arguments for and against drug prohibition|reasons]] ranging from [[individual rights]]-based defenses of [[liberty]], to [[consequentialist]] arguments against the economic and social outcomes of drug prohibition. Starting in the 20th century, large organized movements to overturn existing drug laws formed around the world. The most vocal of these groups exist in [[liberal democracies]], and typically attract [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] supporters, although drug liberalization itself is a non-partisan issue and may be supported by adherents of any ideology.\n\nThe campaign against [[alcohol prohibition]] culminated in the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] repealing prohibition on 5 December 1933, as well as liberalization in [[Canada]], and some but not all of the other countries that enforced prohibition. However, many laws controlling the use of alcohol continue to exist even in these countries.\n\nCurrent proponents of drug liberalization seek the repeal or softening of drug prohibition laws, most commonly [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] but also including other [[controlled substance]]s such as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[opiate]]s, [[stimulant]]s, [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], [[dissociative]]s, [[prescription drug]]s, and others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Policies by country ==\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Thailand====\nAlthough [[Thailand]] has a strict [[drug policy]], in May 2018, the Cabinet approved draft legislation that allows for more research into the effects of marijuana on people.

These medical studies are considered exciting, new landmarks in the history of Thailand, because since 1979, marijuana is a drug and its use, storage and manufacture is illegal.<ref>https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1546686/medical-marijuana-trials-to-start-soon</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 2018, the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] officially proposed to allow licensed medical use of marijuana, thereby legalizing what was previously considered a dangerous drug.\n\nThe National Assembly on Friday submitted its amendments to the Ministry of Health, which would place marijuana and vegetable kratom in the category allowing their licensed possession and distribution in regulated conditions.

In line with the District Courts' argument, the Constitutional Court abolished the Regulation effective from 23 August 2013, noting that the \"''amount larger than small''\" within the meaning of the Criminal Code may be designated only by the means of an Act of Parliament, and not a Governmental Regulation. Moreover, the Constitutional Court further noted that the Regulation merely took over already existing judicial practice of interpretation of what constitutes \"''amount larger than small''\" and thus its abolishment will not really change the criminality of drug possession in the country.<ref name=\"concourt\">{{Citation\n| last       = Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic\n| year       = 2013\n| title      = Ruling No. 259/2013 Coll.\n| publisher  =\n| location = Brno\n| page       =\n| url        =\n| accessdate =\n| language   = Czech\n}}</ref> Thus, the above-mentioned amounts from the now-not-effective Regulation remain as the base for consideration of police and prosecutors, while courts are not bound by the precise grammage.\n\nSale of any amount (not purchase) remains a criminal act.

The reform titled \"From punishment to help\" was approved by the Norwegian goverment in 2017 and is now in the final phase of approval by the parliament. Changes are expected to be implemented by early 2021. The new reform policy emphasizes that criminalizing drug use has no significant effect on rates of drug consumption and that drug addiction is better dealt with by health care services, hence the slogan \"from punishment to help\". Instead of fines or prison time, a person caught with a drug quantity for personal use will now be met with an independent panel consisting of social and health care workers that will discuss administrative sanctions or addiction treatment methods. This will hopefully encourage problematic users to seek help rather than fear of prosecution. There is also hope that this will improve the relationship between drug users and law enforcement officers. Opponents of the reform, including the police force and the progress party, fear that drug use will increase once a person is no longer at risk of facing criminal charges.  <ref> https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/hod/org/styrer-rad-og-utvalg/rusreformutvalget/id2594880</ref>\n\n==== Portugal ====\n{{Main|Drug policy of Portugal}}\nIn 2001, [[Portugal]] became the first European country to abolish all criminal penalties for personal drug possession, under Law 30/2000.<ref>{{cite\n|first = Alex\n|last = Stevens\n|title = The effects of decriminalization of drug use in Portugal\n|date = 2007\n|url = https://kar.kent.ac.uk/13325/\n}}</ref> In addition, drug users were to be provided with [[Drug therapy|therapy]] rather than prison sentences.

This created significant legal and policy tensions between federal and state governments. Since then, 20 more states and the District of Columbia have legalized and regulated medical marijuana. State laws in conflict with federal law about cannabis remain valid, and prevent state level prosecution, despite cannabis being illegal under federal law (see [[Gonzales v. Raich]]).\n\nOn 6 November 2012, Colorado and Washington state legalized possession of small amounts of marijuana for private recreational use, and created a process for writing rules for legal growing and commercial distribution of marijuana within each state.<ref>{{cite news|title=Legalization of Marijuana in Washington and Colorado|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/07/us-usa-marijuana-legalization-idUSBRE8A602D20121107|publisher=reuters|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=7 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 Midterms saw voters in Oregon, Alaska, and Washington, D.C. vote to legalize marijuana for recreational use.\n\nIn 2016, [[Adult Use of Marijuana Act|California Proposition 64]] was passed, legalizing private, recreational use of marijuana for those age 21 or older in the state of California.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/en/propositions/64/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220211718/http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/en/propositions/64/ |archive-date=20 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 2018 midterm ballot, Michigan legalized the recreational use of marijuana in private.\n<ref>https://ballotpedia.org/Michigan_Proposal_1,_Marijuana_Legalization_Initiative_(2018)</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Illinois passed the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, making Illinois the first state to legalize the recreational use by an act of the state legislature.

Since 1985, the Federal Government has run a declared \"War on Drugs\" and while initially Australia led the world in '[[Injecting room|harm-minimization]]' approach, they have since lagged.

Both times Hussey guided the Australians to victory, and on both occasions was the only recognised batsman at the crease at the end of the match.\n\nHussey led Australia in the [[Chappell\u2013Hadlee Trophy]] after selectors rested captain [[Ricky Ponting]] and vice-captain [[Adam Gilchrist]]. The first match against New Zealand saw a 10-wicket loss, the first time Australia had lost by this margin in their One Day International history, although Hussey top scored with 42 off 96 balls. Hussey's record as captain was further marred when Australia lost the top place in the ODI rankings to South Africa for the first time since they were introduced in 2002 after losing to New Zealand two days later. Hussey top-scored for Australia with an aggressive 105 off 84 before another loss in the final match left him with a captaincy record of four losses from four matches.\n\nIn early 2007, Hussey had a major slump in form with an average of only eight in over 10 innings, which scarcely improved in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] where he gained an average of 17.4 with 87 runs. However, this was also due to a lack of opportunities to bat because of Australia's top-order dominance.\n\nIn the fourth ODI in the Commonwealth Bank Series played at the [[MCG]] on 10 February 2008 against India, Australia's top order and middle order collapsed, which saw Hussey come in at 5/72 with the side in deep trouble.  He made a 53-run partnership for the seventh wicket with [[Brett Lee]] (which was the highest partnership of the innings) until Lee fell to Pathan. Hussey batted through the rest of the innings, making an unbeaten 65 off 88 being the only Australian to really contribute to the poor total of 159.\n\nIn the first ODI of the 2008 Bangladesh ODI series, Hussey top-scored with 85 and received the man-of-the-match award. This coincided with his rise to second in the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI player rankings.\n\nAfter initially being left out, Michael Hussey was named in the Australian 2011 World Cup squad as the replacement of [[Doug Bollinger]] after recovering from hamstring injury that needed surgery.<ref>{{cite news| title=Mike Hussey called up to Australia's World Cup squad after injury  | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/06/mike-hussey-australia-world-cup |work=guardian.co.uk|date= 6 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn 19 February 2012, Michael Hussey became the 13th batsman to score 5000 runs for Australia in ODI cricket, when he scored 59 runs against India at the Gabba.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australia vs India \u2013 ODI Match 7, Brisbane Cricket Ground (Woolloongabba), Brisbane, Australia, Sun, 19 Feb 2012|url=http://cricket.yahoo.com/cricket-live-score-australia-vs-india_104726#subnav|accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:Mike Hussey bowling.jpg|thumb|right|Hussey bowls in the Adelaide Oval nets, January 2009.]]\n\n===Tests===\nHussey made his Test debut at the [[Brisbane Cricket Ground|Gabba]] in [[Brisbane]] on 3 November 2005, as a replacement for fellow Western Australian batsman [[Justin Langer]] in the [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 2005\u201306|Australia vs. West Indies series]]. In the first innings Hussey managed only one run, caught by [[Denesh Ramdin]] off the bowling of [[Daren Powell]]. In the second innings Hussey turned in an unimpressive 29. In the following Test, at [[Bellerive Oval]] ([[Tasmania]]) he scored 137 and 31* and was named [[man of the match]]. In the third Test at [[Adelaide Oval]], Hussey was moved down [[Batting order (cricket)|the order]] to number five to accommodate the return of Langer. He made 133 not out in the first innings and 30 not out in the second, bringing his Test average to 120.\n\nOn being moved down the order, Hussey proved invaluable to the Australian team, often building impressive partnerships with the tail-end batsmen, the most impressive being a 107-run 10th-wicket partnership with [[Glenn McGrath]] in the second Test in [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa's]] [[South African cricket team in Australia in 2005\u201306|2005\u201306 tour of Australia]]. Hussey continued his remarkable batting with tail-enders against [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]] in their [[Australian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2005\u201306|Spring 2006 2-Test series]] when he and [[Jason Gillespie]] (as a [[nightwatchman (cricket)|nightwatchman]]) put together a 320-run partnership, with Hussey making a then career-best 182.\n\nOn 18 April 2006 Hussey set a record as the fastest player in terms of time to reach 1,000 Test runs.<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/asksteven/content/story/244991.html/ Fastest player to reach 1000 Test runs]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He reached the milestone in just 166 days. Hussey was also the fastest player to reach the top 10 of the [[LG ICC cricket ratings]]. He maintained an exceptional average of 105.25 in the [[2006\u201307 Ashes series]], which Australia won 5\u20130.\n\n[[File:Gilly and the slips.jpg|thumb|left|340px|Hussey (''far right'') in the slips cordon against India in the 2nd Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]] in 2008]]\n\nIn the second Test of the 2006\u201307 Ashes, Hussey made 91 before he was bowled (playing on) by [[Matthew Hoggard]] and fell nine runs short of his fifth Test century. In the second innings Australia was chasing 168 off 35 overs for victory for a chance to go 2\u20130 up in the series. After the fall of two early wickets, Ponting and Hussey, who was promoted to No. 4 instead of [[Damien Martyn]], formed a steady partnership to guide Australia to victory. Ponting fell on 49 but the battle was well over. Hussey scored the winning runs and made 61 not out from 66 balls. His partner, [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]], scored 21 not out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200604/s1609253.htm|title=Page not Found|date=21 November 2014|access-date=19 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521193551/http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200604/s1609253.htm|archive-date=21 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 December Hussey scored 103 runs off 156 balls\u2014his fifth Test century\u2014on the third day of the third match of the series at the [[WACA Ground]] in Perth. On 6 January 2007 after Australia's 5\u20130 Ashes whitewash, Justin Langer anointed Hussey to be the next leader of the team's victory song [[Australia national cricket team#Under the Southern Cross I Stand|Under the Southern Cross I Stand]].\n\nIn the first Test of the [[Warne-Muralidaran Trophy]] against Sri Lanka, Hussey scored his sixth Test century with a score of 133 runs off 249 balls. He was also part of a record-breaking fourth-wicket partnership with Clarke. Their 245-run partnership is the third-highest partnership for Australia against Sri Lanka in Test matches. In the following match of the Warne-Muralitharan Trophy, Hussey scored his seventh Test century with a score of 132 and following it up in the second innings with 34 not out.\n\nOn 6 January 2008, at the SCG, Hussey scored his eighth Test century against India. This was the first time he scored more than 50 runs at that ground. He ended up not out on 145, before Ponting declared. However, in the first innings of the next Test he scored his first Test [[Duck (cricket)|duck]].\n\nHussey claimed his first Test wicket against South Africa on the third day of the 2008 Boxing Day Test at the MCG, when Paul Harris skied a ball over Mitchell Johnson's head and the latter ran back and took a running catch as the ball fell down past his shoulder.\n\nHussey played in all five of Ashes Test matches in England in 2009, scoring 276 runs in 8 innings. This gave him an average of 34.5. This included a century in Australia's second innings in the Fifth and final Test at [[The Oval]] where he scored 121, potentially saving his Test career after a long run without a century. He also scored two half centuries at Lord's in the Second Test, which England won, and in the Third Test at Edgbaston, which ended in a draw. He also took five catches in the field.\n\nIn the summer of 2009/10 Hussey scored his eleventh test century. Australia were playing Pakistan and were losing badly when Hussey proved yet again that he was brilliant with the tail end, scoring an unbeaten 134. This innings with Peter Siddle who scored 38 potentially saved the match as Australia went from a terrible position to a reasonable one and ended up winning the match with Michael Hussey named man of the match for his heroic effort.\n\nIn the first Test of the Frank Worrell Trophy against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 2009 at the [[Brisbane Cricket Ground|Gabba]], Hussey took his second Test wicket after [[Dwayne Bravo]] hooked a short ball straight to deep backward square leg which was caught comfortably by [[Ben Hilfenhaus]].\n\nPrior to the [[2010/11 Ashes series]], Hussey was experiencing poor form in the warm-up games and many were speculating that he should be dropped, but he was not. In the first test, he scored a magnificent 195, his highest test score, in a partnership of 307 with [[Brad Haddin]], the highest partnership ever at the Gabba, later broken by [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Jonathan Trott]] in the next innings; the test ended in a draw. In the second test, he scored 93 in the first innings following up with a 52 in the next. The next match, he helped Australia to a 267 run win scoring 61 and 116.\n\nIn the 2011 tour (3 test series) of Sri Lanka, he scored 95 & 15 in the first test which rewarded him with the Man of the Match honour. In the second test he made 142 and took two wickets, including a vital one in Kumar Sangakkara, and took a spectacular one-handed full length diving catch in the gully and also being rewarded with the Man of the Match honour. In the third test, he made 118 in the 1st innings.\n\nIn the first Test Match of 2012, Hussey scored an unbeaten 150* to help the Aussies to 659/4(dec). He was involved in a 344 run partnership with Michael Clarke, who managed to score an unbeaten 329*. He was praised for his efforts and he once again cemented himself in the team after being under some serious pressure from critics and selectors.\n\nHussey started the 2012/13 Australian summer well with a century against South Africa in the first test. A partnership with Michael Clarke proved to be vital, as the pair put on more than 200 runs during the fourth and fifth days. This feat was repeated in the 2nd test with another century, and a 272 run partnership with Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-south-africa-2012/engine/current/match/573008.html 2nd Test: Australia v South Africa at Adelaide, Nov 22\u201326, 2012 | Cricket Scorecard].

In the first innings he was run out by Michael Clarke for 25, while in the second he guided Australia to victory with 27*.\n\n===Twenty 20 Internationals===\nHussey was part of Australia's [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] squad which was knocked out in the semi-finals. He played in all of Australia's matches, scoring 65 runs with a best of 37 before injuring a hamstring, which prevented his participation in [[Australian cricket team in India in 2007\u201308|Australia's tour of India]] that followed.\n\nIn May 2010, he scored 60 runs off 24 balls in the semi-final of the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|ICC World Twenty20]] to help defeat Pakistan and secure a place for Australia in the final.

Australian cricket coach, commentator and former international [[cricket]]er, who played all forms of the game. Hussey is also widely known by his nickname 'Mr Cricket'. Hussey was a relative latecomer to both the [[one-day international]] and [[Test cricket|Test]] [[Australia national cricket team|Australian]] teams, debuting at 28 and 30 years of age in the respective formats, with 15,313 first-class runs before making his Test debut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ashes.sportinglife.com/cricket/2006/profiles/australia/story_get.dor?STORY_NAME=ladbrokes/06/10/03/manual_200229.html|title=Sporting Life: Mike Hussey|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903063010/http://ashes.sportinglife.com/cricket/2006/profiles/australia/story_get.dor?STORY_NAME=ladbrokes%2F06%2F10%2F03%2Fmanual_200229.html|archivedate=3 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, he had a highly successful international career, being the top-ranked [[One Day International|ODI]] batsman in the world in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgiccrankings.com/odi/date-specific-ranking.php?stattype=batting&day=07&month=12&year=2006&=Submit/|title=LGICCRANKINGS.COM}}</ref> He played [[first-class cricket]] as vice-captain of the [[Western Warriors]] in Australia and  played for three counties in England, as well as the [[Indian Premier League]] for the [[Chennai Super Kings]].

He then moved to England, where in July 2001 he scored an unbeaten 329 (a [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] club record) at [[Wantage Road]] in his side's 633 for six declared on the way to a 10-wicket victory. He later captained Northamptonshire.  In August 2003 he surpassed his own Northamptonshire record, when he scored 331 not out against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] at [[Taunton]].\n\nWhen Hussey was playing for [[Australia A cricket team|Australia A]], the Australian reserve team, [[Allan Border]] once jokingly suggested he get match practice by staying in the nets for a full six hours; surprisingly, Hussey went on to do just that.<ref name=\"smh\"/>\n\n==International career==\nHussey earned a [[Cricket Australia]] contract in 2004\u201305 after excelling in the [[Ford Ranger One Day Cup|ING Cup]].\nStatistically, Hussey's international career was very successful, with his career [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] in Tests being 51.52 and in ODIs 48.15. He was a very occasional medium pace bowler, bowling only 98 overs in his Test career, 23 of them in 2008. He was brought into the attack usually to give the pace bowlers a rest, although he was once brought on in India to stop [[Ricky Ponting]] getting a one-match ban for a slow over rate. On 28 December 2008, Day 3 of the Boxing Day test, he got his first test wicket, [[Paul Harris (cricketer, born 1978)|Paul Harris]] caught by [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]]. He ended with figures of 1/22.

In this match Hussey made 17* helping Australia win the match by five wickets.\n\nIn the third [[ICC Super Series 2005|Super Series]] match on 9 October 2005, Hussey became the first person to hit the roof of the [[Telstra Dome]] (the [[2005 ICC Super Series|ICC World XI]]'s [[Makhaya Ntini]] was the bowler in this case). On 6 February 2006, he tied with [[Adam Gilchrist]], [[Andrew Symonds]] and [[Brett Lee]] on 22 votes for the Australian One-Day Player of the Year at the annual [[Allan Border Medal]] presentation. However, Symonds was ruled ineligible after an alcohol-related indiscretion, and after Lee and Gilchrist were eliminated on countback, Hussey was named the outright winner. Hussey had also come second overall in the Allan Border medal his first year in international cricket. On 3 November 2006, Hussey became the [[International Cricket Council|ICC's]] [[One Day International|ODI]] [[ICC Awards|Player of the Year]] at the annual ICC Awards in Mumbai. He was also named in its World ODI XI in 2006 and as 12th man in 2007.\n[[File:Pm cricket shots09 5927.jpg|thumb|left|Hussey in the field in the Third Test against South Africa at the SCG in January 2009]]\n\nOn 18 September 2006, owing to Australia's rotation policy, and in [[Ricky Ponting]]'s absence, Hussey captained Australia for the first time in the [[DLF Cup 2006-07|DLF Cup]] second round match against [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] at [[Kinrara Academy Oval|Kuala Lumpur]].<ref name=\"guardianbooth\">{{cite news\n| title = Australia's next captain?

Both times Hussey guided the Australians to victory, and on both occasions was the only recognised batsman at the crease at the end of the match.\n\nHussey led Australia in the [[Chappell\u2013Hadlee Trophy]] after selectors rested captain [[Ricky Ponting]] and vice-captain [[Adam Gilchrist]]. The first match against New Zealand saw a 10-wicket loss, the first time Australia had lost by this margin in their One Day International history, although Hussey top scored with 42 off 96 balls. Hussey's record as captain was further marred when Australia lost the top place in the ODI rankings to South Africa for the first time since they were introduced in 2002 after losing to New Zealand two days later. Hussey top-scored for Australia with an aggressive 105 off 84 before another loss in the final match left him with a captaincy record of four losses from four matches.\n\nIn early 2007, Hussey had a major slump in form with an average of only eight in over 10 innings, which scarcely improved in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] where he gained an average of 17.4 with 87 runs. However, this was also due to a lack of opportunities to bat because of Australia's top-order dominance.\n\nIn the fourth ODI in the Commonwealth Bank Series played at the [[MCG]] on 10 February 2008 against India, Australia's top order and middle order collapsed, which saw Hussey come in at 5/72 with the side in deep trouble.  He made a 53-run partnership for the seventh wicket with [[Brett Lee]] (which was the highest partnership of the innings) until Lee fell to Pathan. Hussey batted through the rest of the innings, making an unbeaten 65 off 88 being the only Australian to really contribute to the poor total of 159.\n\nIn the first ODI of the 2008 Bangladesh ODI series, Hussey top-scored with 85 and received the man-of-the-match award. This coincided with his rise to second in the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI player rankings.\n\nAfter initially being left out, Michael Hussey was named in the Australian 2011 World Cup squad as the replacement of [[Doug Bollinger]] after recovering from hamstring injury that needed surgery.<ref>{{cite news| title=Mike Hussey called up to Australia's World Cup squad after injury  | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/06/mike-hussey-australia-world-cup |work=guardian.co.uk|date= 6 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn 19 February 2012, Michael Hussey became the 13th batsman to score 5000 runs for Australia in ODI cricket, when he scored 59 runs against India at the Gabba.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australia vs India \u2013 ODI Match 7, Brisbane Cricket Ground (Woolloongabba), Brisbane, Australia, Sun, 19 Feb 2012|url=http://cricket.yahoo.com/cricket-live-score-australia-vs-india_104726#subnav|accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:Mike Hussey bowling.jpg|thumb|right|Hussey bowls in the Adelaide Oval nets, January 2009.]]\n\n===Tests===\nHussey made his Test debut at the [[Brisbane Cricket Ground|Gabba]] in [[Brisbane]] on 3 November 2005, as a replacement for fellow Western Australian batsman [[Justin Langer]] in the [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 2005\u201306|Australia vs. West Indies series]]. In the first innings Hussey managed only one run, caught by [[Denesh Ramdin]] off the bowling of [[Daren Powell]]. In the second innings Hussey turned in an unimpressive 29. In the following Test, at [[Bellerive Oval]] ([[Tasmania]]) he scored 137 and 31* and was named [[man of the match]]. In the third Test at [[Adelaide Oval]], Hussey was moved down [[Batting order (cricket)|the order]] to number five to accommodate the return of Langer. He made 133 not out in the first innings and 30 not out in the second, bringing his Test average to 120.\n\nOn being moved down the order, Hussey proved invaluable to the Australian team, often building impressive partnerships with the tail-end batsmen, the most impressive being a 107-run 10th-wicket partnership with [[Glenn McGrath]] in the second Test in [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa's]] [[South African cricket team in Australia in 2005\u201306|2005\u201306 tour of Australia]]. Hussey continued his remarkable batting with tail-enders against [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]] in their [[Australian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2005\u201306|Spring 2006 2-Test series]] when he and [[Jason Gillespie]] (as a [[nightwatchman (cricket)|nightwatchman]]) put together a 320-run partnership, with Hussey making a then career-best 182.\n\nOn 18 April 2006 Hussey set a record as the fastest player in terms of time to reach 1,000 Test runs.<ref>[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/asksteven/content/story/244991.html/ Fastest player to reach 1000 Test runs]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He reached the milestone in just 166 days. Hussey was also the fastest player to reach the top 10 of the [[LG ICC cricket ratings]]. He maintained an exceptional average of 105.25 in the [[2006\u201307 Ashes series]], which Australia won 5\u20130.\n\n[[File:Gilly and the slips.jpg|thumb|left|340px|Hussey (''far right'') in the slips cordon against India in the 2nd Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]] in 2008]]\n\nIn the second Test of the 2006\u201307 Ashes, Hussey made 91 before he was bowled (playing on) by [[Matthew Hoggard]] and fell nine runs short of his fifth Test century. In the second innings Australia was chasing 168 off 35 overs for victory for a chance to go 2\u20130 up in the series. After the fall of two early wickets, Ponting and Hussey, who was promoted to No. 4 instead of [[Damien Martyn]], formed a steady partnership to guide Australia to victory. Ponting fell on 49 but the battle was well over. Hussey scored the winning runs and made 61 not out from 66 balls. His partner, [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]], scored 21 not out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200604/s1609253.htm|title=Page not Found|date=21 November 2014|access-date=19 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521193551/http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200604/s1609253.htm|archive-date=21 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 December Hussey scored 103 runs off 156 balls\u2014his fifth Test century\u2014on the third day of the third match of the series at the [[WACA Ground]] in Perth. On 6 January 2007 after Australia's 5\u20130 Ashes whitewash, Justin Langer anointed Hussey to be the next leader of the team's victory song [[Australia national cricket team#Under the Southern Cross I Stand|Under the Southern Cross I Stand]].\n\nIn the first Test of the [[Warne-Muralidaran Trophy]] against Sri Lanka, Hussey scored his sixth Test century with a score of 133 runs off 249 balls. He was also part of a record-breaking fourth-wicket partnership with Clarke. Their 245-run partnership is the third-highest partnership for Australia against Sri Lanka in Test matches. In the following match of the Warne-Muralitharan Trophy, Hussey scored his seventh Test century with a score of 132 and following it up in the second innings with 34 not out.\n\nOn 6 January 2008, at the SCG, Hussey scored his eighth Test century against India. This was the first time he scored more than 50 runs at that ground. He ended up not out on 145, before Ponting declared. However, in the first innings of the next Test he scored his first Test [[Duck (cricket)|duck]].\n\nHussey claimed his first Test wicket against South Africa on the third day of the 2008 Boxing Day Test at the MCG, when Paul Harris skied a ball over Mitchell Johnson's head and the latter ran back and took a running catch as the ball fell down past his shoulder.\n\nHussey played in all five of Ashes Test matches in England in 2009, scoring 276 runs in 8 innings. This gave him an average of 34.5. This included a century in Australia's second innings in the Fifth and final Test at [[The Oval]] where he scored 121, potentially saving his Test career after a long run without a century. He also scored two half centuries at Lord's in the Second Test, which England won, and in the Third Test at Edgbaston, which ended in a draw. He also took five catches in the field.\n\nIn the summer of 2009/10 Hussey scored his eleventh test century. Australia were playing Pakistan and were losing badly when Hussey proved yet again that he was brilliant with the tail end, scoring an unbeaten 134. This innings with Peter Siddle who scored 38 potentially saved the match as Australia went from a terrible position to a reasonable one and ended up winning the match with Michael Hussey named man of the match for his heroic effort.\n\nIn the first Test of the Frank Worrell Trophy against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 2009 at the [[Brisbane Cricket Ground|Gabba]], Hussey took his second Test wicket after [[Dwayne Bravo]] hooked a short ball straight to deep backward square leg which was caught comfortably by [[Ben Hilfenhaus]].\n\nPrior to the [[2010/11 Ashes series]], Hussey was experiencing poor form in the warm-up games and many were speculating that he should be dropped, but he was not. In the first test, he scored a magnificent 195, his highest test score, in a partnership of 307 with [[Brad Haddin]], the highest partnership ever at the Gabba, later broken by [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Jonathan Trott]] in the next innings; the test ended in a draw. In the second test, he scored 93 in the first innings following up with a 52 in the next. The next match, he helped Australia to a 267 run win scoring 61 and 116.\n\nIn the 2011 tour (3 test series) of Sri Lanka, he scored 95 & 15 in the first test which rewarded him with the Man of the Match honour. In the second test he made 142 and took two wickets, including a vital one in Kumar Sangakkara, and took a spectacular one-handed full length diving catch in the gully and also being rewarded with the Man of the Match honour. In the third test, he made 118 in the 1st innings.\n\nIn the first Test Match of 2012, Hussey scored an unbeaten 150* to help the Aussies to 659/4(dec). He was involved in a 344 run partnership with Michael Clarke, who managed to score an unbeaten 329*. He was praised for his efforts and he once again cemented himself in the team after being under some serious pressure from critics and selectors.\n\nHussey started the 2012/13 Australian summer well with a century against South Africa in the first test. A partnership with Michael Clarke proved to be vital, as the pair put on more than 200 runs during the fourth and fifth days. This feat was repeated in the 2nd test with another century, and a 272 run partnership with Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-south-africa-2012/engine/current/match/573008.html 2nd Test: Australia v South Africa at Adelaide, Nov 22\u201326, 2012 | Cricket Scorecard].

In the first innings he was run out by Michael Clarke for 25, while in the second he guided Australia to victory with 27*.\n\n===Twenty 20 Internationals===\nHussey was part of Australia's [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] squad which was knocked out in the semi-finals. He played in all of Australia's matches, scoring 65 runs with a best of 37 before injuring a hamstring, which prevented his participation in [[Australian cricket team in India in 2007\u201308|Australia's tour of India]] that followed.\n\nIn May 2010, he scored 60 runs off 24 balls in the semi-final of the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|ICC World Twenty20]] to help defeat Pakistan and secure a place for Australia in the final.

Arguably the first Colombian scientist, he is often nicknamed \"El Sabio\" (Spanish for \"The learned,\" \"The sage\" or \"The wise\").\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nCaldas was born in [[Popay\u00e1n]], in 1768.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://enciclopedia.banrepcultural.org/index.php/Francisco_Jos%C3%A9_de_Caldas|title=Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas|last=|first=|date=|website=Enciclopedia de la Red Cultural del Banco de la Rep\u00fablica en Colombia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> His parents were Jos\u00e9 de Caldas and Vicenta Tenorio, the aunt of fellow independence hero [[Camilo Torres Tenorio]]. Like his cousin, Caldas studied in the Seminary of Popay\u00e1n, where he met others of the leaders of the Colombian independence movement like [[Francisco Antonio Zea]]. Also like his cousin, in 1788 and pressed by his father he moved to [[Bogot\u00e1|Santaf\u00e9]] (modern day Bogot\u00e1) to study jurisprudence in the [[Del Rosario University|Colegio del Rosario]], where he obtained a bachelor's degree in 1793. As a student, Caldas was always interested in the study of [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and the [[natural sciences]], and he only studied law as a result of his father's pressure. Following this, he relocated to Popay\u00e1n, to administer the family businesses and as a trader, a craft in which he was very unsuccessful. \n\n== Scientific and Academic Career ==\nDuring his many business trips to Santaf\u00e9, Caldas was more concerned with scientific observation and devoted long hours to determine geographical coordinates and to make observations. He was particularly concerned with determining the geographical location and altitude of different places, so he was always using a barometer, a thermometer, and a compass. His interest on determining altitude and the fortuitous breaking of a thermometer led to his development of the [[hypsometer]], an apparatus that determined altitude as a function of the boiling point of water.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Bateman|first=Alfredo|title=Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas: S\u00edntesis biogr\u00e1fica|publisher=Kelly|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> His studies and records of the time survive in both his letters and memoirs, including a map of the course of the Prado river in the department of [[Tolima Department|Tolima]], notes about medicinal trees, a description of the stone hieroglyphs in [[Aipe]] and of the statues at [[San Agust\u00edn Archaeological Park|San Agust\u00edn]], experiments to determine whether an insect was venomous, and many others.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> His descriptions about the leveling in the plants growing close to the equinoctial line were sent to [[Jos\u00e9 Celestino Mutis]], and as a consequence Mutis appointed him to the Botanical Expedition.<ref>Stephen T. Jackson, \"Biographical Sketches\" in ''Essay on the Geography of Plants'' by Alexander von Humboldt. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2009, pp. 230-31.</ref> \n\nFollowing a trip to [[Quito]], he then traveled to [[Ibarra, Ecuador|Ibarra]] to meet [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Aim\u00e9 Bonpland]], on December 31, 1801. Considering that he was situated in the relative backwater of Popay\u00e1n, Humboldt was impressed with his scientific accomplishments. Caldas gave Humboldt and Bonpland data on the altitudes in the region and became their personal friend, and was mentored by them in the study of [[botany]]. Together they did some exploration in the surroundings of Quito. Unable to continue traveling with Humboldt, he devoted wholeheartedly to scientific enterprises, and to write his memoirs.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAfter traveling through Peru and Ecuador, and across the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] exploring the newfound land, studying [[flora]], [[fauna]], [[geography]], [[meteorology]] and [[cartography]], Caldas returned to Santaf\u00e9 in 1805, where he started working for the Botanical Expedition. Mutis charged him with directing the recently built Astronomic Observatory. During this time he also created a newspaper, \"El Semanario,\" in 1808, where many of his academic writings were published. Caldas expected to be appointed director of the Botanical Expedition following Mutis' death in 1808, but Mutis had appointed his nephew Sinforoso Mutis, instead. Caldas was, nevertheless, confirmed as director of the Astronomical Observatory, and was in charge of studying the [[flora]] of Bogot\u00e1. He was appointed also as a lecturer of elementary mathematics at the [[Del Rosario University|Colegio del Rosario]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Political and Military Life ==\n\n=== July 20, 1810, and the Colombian Declaration of Independence ===\nFollowing the death of Mutis in 1809, future independence leaders like Caldas' cousin [[Camilo Torres Tenorio|Camilo Torres]], and [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]], started meeting clandestinely in one of the halls of the Observatory. While Caldas certainly allowed the meetings, his involvement was minimal as he was more interested in his scientific enterprises. During this period he published his \"Scientific Memoirs,\" a continuation of his Semanario. \n\nCaldas was actively involved, nonetheless, in the events of [[Colombian Declaration of Independence|July 20, 1810]]. Following the lead of cities like [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]], which had created their own [[Junta (Spanish American Independence)|juntas]], a plot was developed to stimulate the formation of a junta in Santaf\u00e9. The plot famously consisted of borrowing a flower vase or some other object from a Peninsular Spaniard, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Llorente, to use it in a celebration for the arrival of commissioner of the Regency [[Antonio Villavicencio]] to the city, taking advantage of the fact that Villavicencio's arrival had brought hundreds of people to the city. The plot creators were hoping that Llorente would refuse, and would use the refusal to call for the formation of a Junta, and to do so, Caldas agreed to drop by at the time of the request so that he could be \"reprimanded\" for dealing with a Spaniard who was mistreating the creoles. As planned, the \"offended\" started shouting the offenses by Peninsular Spaniards, and calling for the installation of a Junta. This led, as planned, to a city revolt following which [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 Amar y Borb\u00f3n|Viceroy Amar]] peacefully agreed to the formation of the Santaf\u00e9 junta. The date of the formation of this junta is considered the official [[Colombian Declaration of Independence|Day of Independence of Colombia]]. \n\n=== After the Declaration of Independence ===\nFollowing the events of July 20, Caldas and [[Joaqu\u00edn Camacho]] were asked to create the first newspaper of the newly founded Republic, called the \"Diario Pol\u00edtico de Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1\" (Political Journal of Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1), first published on August 27, 1810<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://babel.banrepcultural.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17054coll26/id/1443|title=Diario pol\u00edtico de Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 - No. 1|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Diario published a complete description of all the events surrounding the creation of the Junta, and published articles about political economics and the political decisions of the Junta. Caldas kept publishing his Scientific Memoirs during this period.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn September, 1811, [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]] was appointed as President of the [[Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca]]. One of his first actions as a president was the formation of the Army [[Sapper|Engineer Corps]], and Caldas was then appointed to them as a Captain, and charged with making plots of roads and itineraries. Caldas was part of the troops sent by [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o|Nari\u00f1o]], under the command of General Antonio Baraya, to defeat the federalists that were assembled in the Congress of the United Provinces in Tunja. Baraya, however, decided to switch factions and support the federalist forces, and Caldas joined him, signing the act that declared Nari\u00f1o an usurper and a tyrant, and supporting the Congress in May, 1812. Caldas was appointed as member of the Military Commission of the Congress, and was given the rank of Liutenant Colonel, and was involved in the Battle of Ventaquemada on December 2, 1812, on which the federalist troops were victor, and in the Battle of San Victorino (or Battle of Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1, San Victorino y Las Cruces), on January 9, 1813, where the federalist troops were utterly defeated.\n\nAfter being defeated in the rebellion, Caldas, fearing reprisals, escaped to Popay\u00e1n, but finding that it had been overtaken by the royal troops commanded by future viceroy [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de S\u00e1mano y Uribarri|Juan S\u00e1mano]], went then to the province of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]]. Antioquia had declared independence as the \"State of Antioquia\" or the \"Free and Sovereign State of Antioquia.\" The Antioquia state had appointed Juan del Corral as a dictator, and del Corral welcomed Caldas and appointed him to create a Military School and as Director of Rifle Factories and General Engineer, as well as giving him the rank of Colonel.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Villegas Villegas|first=Diego|date=April 2008 |title=El sabio Francisco Jose de Caldas en Antioquia 1813 - 1815|url=http://academiaantioquenadehistoria.org/revistas/index.php/repertorio-historico/issue/view/171|journal=Repertorio Hist\u00f3rico de la Academia Antioque\u00f1a de Historia|volume=103|pages=10-21|via=}}</ref> As an engineer, Caldas was in charge of erecting buildings, powder mills, and gun factories, as well as coin minting.

By the end of 1814, Nari\u00f1o had been defeated and arrested by the Spanish crown, and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]] and his army had forced the submission of Cundinamarca to the United Provinces. The federalist General Government, which had been established in Santaf\u00e9, with growing concerns about the possibility of a [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada|Spanish reconquest]] following the start of [[Pablo Morillo|Morillo]]'s campaign, then called Caldas to appoint him with the creation of a similar Military School, and to build bridges, trenches, and fortifications around the city.

Like the other leaders of the Independence movement, Caldas escaped the city, originally with the goal of getting to [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]] to escape abroad.

Arguably the first Colombian scientist, he is often nicknamed \"El Sabio\" (Spanish for \"The learned,\" \"The sage\" or \"The wise\").\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nCaldas was born in [[Popay\u00e1n]], in 1768.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://enciclopedia.banrepcultural.org/index.php/Francisco_Jos%C3%A9_de_Caldas|title=Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas|last=|first=|date=|website=Enciclopedia de la Red Cultural del Banco de la Rep\u00fablica en Colombia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> His parents were Jos\u00e9 de Caldas and Vicenta Tenorio, the aunt of fellow independence hero [[Camilo Torres Tenorio]]. Like his cousin, Caldas studied in the Seminary of Popay\u00e1n, where he met others of the leaders of the Colombian independence movement like [[Francisco Antonio Zea]]. Also like his cousin, in 1788 and pressed by his father he moved to [[Bogot\u00e1|Santaf\u00e9]] (modern day Bogot\u00e1) to study jurisprudence in the [[Del Rosario University|Colegio del Rosario]], where he obtained a bachelor's degree in 1793. As a student, Caldas was always interested in the study of [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and the [[natural sciences]], and he only studied law as a result of his father's pressure. Following this, he relocated to Popay\u00e1n, to administer the family businesses and as a trader, a craft in which he was very unsuccessful. \n\n== Scientific and Academic Career ==\nDuring his many business trips to Santaf\u00e9, Caldas was more concerned with scientific observation and devoted long hours to determine geographical coordinates and to make observations. He was particularly concerned with determining the geographical location and altitude of different places, so he was always using a barometer, a thermometer, and a compass. His interest on determining altitude and the fortuitous breaking of a thermometer led to his development of the [[hypsometer]], an apparatus that determined altitude as a function of the boiling point of water.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Bateman|first=Alfredo|title=Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas: S\u00edntesis biogr\u00e1fica|publisher=Kelly|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> His studies and records of the time survive in both his letters and memoirs, including a map of the course of the Prado river in the department of [[Tolima Department|Tolima]], notes about medicinal trees, a description of the stone hieroglyphs in [[Aipe]] and of the statues at [[San Agust\u00edn Archaeological Park|San Agust\u00edn]], experiments to determine whether an insect was venomous, and many others.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> His descriptions about the leveling in the plants growing close to the equinoctial line were sent to [[Jos\u00e9 Celestino Mutis]], and as a consequence Mutis appointed him to the Botanical Expedition.<ref>Stephen T. Jackson, \"Biographical Sketches\" in ''Essay on the Geography of Plants'' by Alexander von Humboldt. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2009, pp. 230-31.</ref> \n\nFollowing a trip to [[Quito]], he then traveled to [[Ibarra, Ecuador|Ibarra]] to meet [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Aim\u00e9 Bonpland]], on December 31, 1801. Considering that he was situated in the relative backwater of Popay\u00e1n, Humboldt was impressed with his scientific accomplishments. Caldas gave Humboldt and Bonpland data on the altitudes in the region and became their personal friend, and was mentored by them in the study of [[botany]]. Together they did some exploration in the surroundings of Quito. Unable to continue traveling with Humboldt, he devoted wholeheartedly to scientific enterprises, and to write his memoirs.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAfter traveling through Peru and Ecuador, and across the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] exploring the newfound land, studying [[flora]], [[fauna]], [[geography]], [[meteorology]] and [[cartography]], Caldas returned to Santaf\u00e9 in 1805, where he started working for the Botanical Expedition. Mutis charged him with directing the recently built Astronomic Observatory. During this time he also created a newspaper, \"El Semanario,\" in 1808, where many of his academic writings were published. Caldas expected to be appointed director of the Botanical Expedition following Mutis' death in 1808, but Mutis had appointed his nephew Sinforoso Mutis, instead. Caldas was, nevertheless, confirmed as director of the Astronomical Observatory, and was in charge of studying the [[flora]] of Bogot\u00e1. He was appointed also as a lecturer of elementary mathematics at the [[Del Rosario University|Colegio del Rosario]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Political and Military Life ==\n\n=== July 20, 1810, and the Colombian Declaration of Independence ===\nFollowing the death of Mutis in 1809, future independence leaders like Caldas' cousin [[Camilo Torres Tenorio|Camilo Torres]], and [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]], started meeting clandestinely in one of the halls of the Observatory. While Caldas certainly allowed the meetings, his involvement was minimal as he was more interested in his scientific enterprises. During this period he published his \"Scientific Memoirs,\" a continuation of his Semanario. \n\nCaldas was actively involved, nonetheless, in the events of [[Colombian Declaration of Independence|July 20, 1810]]. Following the lead of cities like [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]], which had created their own [[Junta (Spanish American Independence)|juntas]], a plot was developed to stimulate the formation of a junta in Santaf\u00e9. The plot famously consisted of borrowing a flower vase or some other object from a Peninsular Spaniard, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Llorente, to use it in a celebration for the arrival of commissioner of the Regency [[Antonio Villavicencio]] to the city, taking advantage of the fact that Villavicencio's arrival had brought hundreds of people to the city. The plot creators were hoping that Llorente would refuse, and would use the refusal to call for the formation of a Junta, and to do so, Caldas agreed to drop by at the time of the request so that he could be \"reprimanded\" for dealing with a Spaniard who was mistreating the creoles. As planned, the \"offended\" started shouting the offenses by Peninsular Spaniards, and calling for the installation of a Junta. This led, as planned, to a city revolt following which [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 Amar y Borb\u00f3n|Viceroy Amar]] peacefully agreed to the formation of the Santaf\u00e9 junta. The date of the formation of this junta is considered the official [[Colombian Declaration of Independence|Day of Independence of Colombia]]. \n\n=== After the Declaration of Independence ===\nFollowing the events of July 20, Caldas and [[Joaqu\u00edn Camacho]] were asked to create the first newspaper of the newly founded Republic, called the \"Diario Pol\u00edtico de Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1\" (Political Journal of Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1), first published on August 27, 1810<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://babel.banrepcultural.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17054coll26/id/1443|title=Diario pol\u00edtico de Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 - No. 1|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Diario published a complete description of all the events surrounding the creation of the Junta, and published articles about political economics and the political decisions of the Junta. Caldas kept publishing his Scientific Memoirs during this period.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn September, 1811, [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]] was appointed as President of the [[Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca]]. One of his first actions as a president was the formation of the Army [[Sapper|Engineer Corps]], and Caldas was then appointed to them as a Captain, and charged with making plots of roads and itineraries. Caldas was part of the troops sent by [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o|Nari\u00f1o]], under the command of General Antonio Baraya, to defeat the federalists that were assembled in the Congress of the United Provinces in Tunja. Baraya, however, decided to switch factions and support the federalist forces, and Caldas joined him, signing the act that declared Nari\u00f1o an usurper and a tyrant, and supporting the Congress in May, 1812. Caldas was appointed as member of the Military Commission of the Congress, and was given the rank of Liutenant Colonel, and was involved in the Battle of Ventaquemada on December 2, 1812, on which the federalist troops were victor, and in the Battle of San Victorino (or Battle of Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1, San Victorino y Las Cruces), on January 9, 1813, where the federalist troops were utterly defeated.\n\nAfter being defeated in the rebellion, Caldas, fearing reprisals, escaped to Popay\u00e1n, but finding that it had been overtaken by the royal troops commanded by future viceroy [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de S\u00e1mano y Uribarri|Juan S\u00e1mano]], went then to the province of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]]. Antioquia had declared independence as the \"State of Antioquia\" or the \"Free and Sovereign State of Antioquia.\" The Antioquia state had appointed Juan del Corral as a dictator, and del Corral welcomed Caldas and appointed him to create a Military School and as Director of Rifle Factories and General Engineer, as well as giving him the rank of Colonel.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Villegas Villegas|first=Diego|date=April 2008 |title=El sabio Francisco Jose de Caldas en Antioquia 1813 - 1815|url=http://academiaantioquenadehistoria.org/revistas/index.php/repertorio-historico/issue/view/171|journal=Repertorio Hist\u00f3rico de la Academia Antioque\u00f1a de Historia|volume=103|pages=10-21|via=}}</ref> As an engineer, Caldas was in charge of erecting buildings, powder mills, and gun factories, as well as coin minting.

By the end of 1814, Nari\u00f1o had been defeated and arrested by the Spanish crown, and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]] and his army had forced the submission of Cundinamarca to the United Provinces. The federalist General Goverment, which had been established in Santaf\u00e9, with growing concerns about the possibility of a [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada|Spanish reconquest]] following the start of [[Pablo Morillo|Morillo]]'s campaign, then called Caldas to appoint him with the creation of a similar Military School, and to build bridges, trenches, and fortifications around the city. He was sent to the northern army and to fortify roads in [[Quind\u00edo Department|Quind\u00edo]].\n\n==Death==\n[[Pablo Morillo]] [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada|finally captured]] Santaf\u00e9 on May 6, 1816. Like the other leaders of the Independence movement, Caldas escaped the city, originally with the goal of getting to [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]] to escape abroad. On the way, however, future viceroy [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de S\u00e1mano y Uribarri|S\u00e1mano]] is victorious over the republican troops in the Battle of la Cuchilla de El Tambo, and reconquers Popay\u00e1n, and Caldas is forced to hide in the Paisbamba Farm in [[Sotar\u00e1, Cauca|Sotar\u00e1]], where he is soon arrested by the Spanish royalists in 1816.<ref name=\":1\" /> He was then sent back to Santaf\u00e9, and [[execution|executed]] by a firing squad on October 29, 1816, in the [[Santander Park|San Francisco Plaza]] <ref name=\"HenaoArrubla1820\">{{cite book|author1=Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Henao|author2=Gerardo Arrubla|title=Historia de Colombia para la ense\u00f1anza secundaria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CzVAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA350|year=1820|publisher=Librer\u00eda Colombiana, C.

A special branch of the family originates from a great-grandson of Hajji Theodoros who changed his name to Kassiotis. Georgios Kassiotis served as an officer of the [[Hellenic Army|Greek cavalry]] during the [[Greco-Italian War|Second World War]] and later distinguished himself as a stockbroker and [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|politician]].

Others say it derives from the Hungarian word {{lang|hu|sziget}} which means 'island'. Others still contend that {{lang|hu|szeg}} means 'dark blond' ({{lang|hu|s\u00f6t\u00e9tsz\u0151k\u00e9s}}) \u2013 a reference to the color of the water where the rivers [[Tisza]] and [[Mure\u0219 (river)|Maros]] merge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.szegedportal.hu/index.php?pg=101|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018021019/http://www.szegedportal.hu/index.php?pg=101|url-status=dead|title=On etymology|archivedate=18 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe city has its own name in a number of foreign languages, usually by adding a suffix ''-in'' to the Hungarian name: [[Croatian language|Croatian]] {{lang|hr|Segedin}}; [[Romanian language|Romanian]] {{lang|ro|Seghedin}}; [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] {{lang|ru|\u0421\u0435\u0433\u0435\u0434}} (''Seged''); [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Szegedin}} or {{lang|de|Segedin}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|el|\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd}} (''Partiscum''); [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|Seghedino}}; [[Latin language|Latin]] {{lang|la|Partiscum}}; [[Latvian language|Latvian]] {{lang|lv|Segeda}}; [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] {{lang|lt|Segedas}}; [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|Segedyn}}; [[Serbian language|Serbian]] {{lang|sr|\u0421\u0435\u0433\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d}} (''Segedin''); [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Czech language|Czech]] {{lang|sk|Seged\u00edn}}; [[Turkish language|Turkish]] {{lang|tr|Segedin}}.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:KassVigad\u00f3KJ.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Early 20th century postcard]]\nSzeged and its area have been inhabited since ancient times. [[Ptolemy]] mentions the oldest known name of the city: ''Partiscum.'' It is possible that [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], king of the [[Huns]] had his seat somewhere in this area. The name Szeged was first mentioned in 1183, in a document of King [[B\u00e9la III]].\n\nIn the second century AD there was a Roman trading post established on an island in the Tisza, and the foundations of the Szeged castle suggest that the structure may have been built over an even earlier fort. Today only one corner of the castle still remains standing.<ref>Szeged by Dr. Trogmayer Ott\u00f3</ref>\n\nDuring [[Mongol invasion of Europe|the Mongol invasion]] the town was destroyed and its inhabitants fled to the nearby swamps, but they soon returned and rebuilt their town. In the 14th century, during the reign of [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]], Szeged became the most important town of Southern Hungary, and \u2013 as the Turkish armies got closer to Hungary \u2013 the strategic importance of Szeged grew. King [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]] had a [[city wall|wall]] built around the town. Szeged was raised to [[free royal town]] status in 1498.\n\nSzeged was first pillaged by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] army on 28 September 1526, but was occupied only in 1543, and became an administrative centre of the Ottomans (see [[Ottoman Hungary]]). The town was a sanjak centre first in [[Budin Province, Ottoman Empire|Budin Eyaleti]] (1543\u20131596), after in [[E\u011fri Eyalet]]i. The town was freed from Turkish rule on 23 October 1686, and regained the free royal town status in 1715. In 1719, Szeged received its [[coat of arms]] (still used today) from [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles III]]. During the next several years, Szeged grew and prospered. [[Piarists|Piarist]] monks arrived in Szeged in 1719 and opened a new grammar school in 1721. Szeged also held scientific lectures and theatrical plays. These years brought not only prosperity but also enlightenment. Between 1728 and 1744 [[witch trial]]s were frequent in the town, with the [[Szeged witch trials]] of 1728-29 perhaps being the largest. The witch trials were instigated by the authorities, who decided on this measure to remove the problem of the public complaints about the drought and its consequences of famine and epidemics by laying the responsibility on people among them, which had fraternized with the Devil.  In 1720, the ethnic Hungarian population of the town numbered about 13000 to 16000, while the number of the Serb inhabitants was 1300.<ref>\u00c1d\u00e1m Fej\u00e9r, Magyarok \u00e9s szl\u00e1vok.

Paprika arrived in Hungary in the second half of the 16th century as an ornamental plant. About 100 years later the plant was cultivated as an herb, and paprika as we know it.<ref name=\"paprika\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728021200/http://www.vickery.tv/acatalog/Paprika.html|title=Vickery TV Paprika (Hungary)|date=28 July 2009|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> Szeged is also famous for their [[szekelygulyas]], a goulash made with pork, sauerkraut and sour cream.<ref name=\"szekelygulyas\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.talktalk.co.uk/notices/web-space-closing.html?accessurl=http://www.fourman.dsl.pipex.com/recipes/szekelygulyas.html|title=TalkTalk Webspace is closing soon!!|website=www.talktalk.co.uk}}</ref> And also famous for their [[hal\u00e1szl\u00e9]], fish soup made of carp and catfish.\n\nThe citizens of Szeged played an important part in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]. [[Lajos Kossuth]] delivered his famous speech here. Szeged was the last seat of the revolutionary government in July 1849. The [[Habsburg]] rulers punished the leaders of the town, but later Szeged began to prosper again, the railway reached it in 1854, and the town got its free royal town status back in 1860. Mark Pick's shop \u2013 the predecessor of today's world-famous Pick [[Salami]] Factory \u2013 was opened in 1869.\n[[File:Szeged, Dugonics t\u00e9r a nagy\u00e1rv\u00edzkor, szemben a K\u00e1lv\u00e1ria-sug\u00e1r\u00fat. Fortepan 15599.jpg|thumb|Szeged during the flood of 1879]]\nToday the inner city of Szeged has beautiful buildings and wide avenues. This is mainly due to the great [[flood]] of 1879, which literally wiped away the whole town (only 265 of the 5723 houses remained and 165 people died). Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] visited the town and promised that \"Szeged will be more beautiful than it used to be\". He kept his promise. During the next years a new, modern city emerged from the ruins, with palaces and wide streets.\n\n===During the 20th century===\n[[File:Sz\u00e9chenyi t\u00e9r, a Zs\u00f3t\u00e9r-h\u00e1z el\u0151tti sz\u00e9lesebb j\u00e1rda.

Fortepan 8569.jpg|thumb|Swimmers at Szeged, 1939]]\nAfter the [[Hungary in World War I|First World War]] Hungary lost its southern territories to [[Serbia]], as a result Szeged became a city close to the [[border]], and its importance lessened, but as it took over roles that formerly belonged to the now lost cities, it slowly recovered. Following the Loss of [[Transylvania]] to Romania, University of Kolozsv\u00e1r (now [[Cluj-Napoca]]), moved to Szeged in 1921 (see [[University of Szeged]]). In 1923 Szeged took over the role of [[Bishop|episcopal]] seat from Temesv\u00e1r (now [[Timi\u0219oara]], Romania). It was briefly occupied by [[Romanian army]] during [[Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919|Hungarian-Romanian War]] in 1919. During the 1920s the Jewish population of Szeged grew and reached its zenith.\n\nSzeged suffered heavily during [[Hungary in World War II|World War II]]. 6,000 inhabitants of the city were killed, the Jewish citizens were confined to [[ghetto]]s and then taken to [[death camp]]s. Szeged was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[Steppe Front|2nd Ukrainian Front]] on 11 October 1944 in the course of the [[Battle of Debrecen]]. During the Communist-era, Szeged became a centre of [[light industry]] and [[food industry]]. In 1965 [[Petroleum|oil]] was found near the city.\n\nIn 1962, Szeged became the county seat of Csongr\u00e1d. Whole new districts were built, and lots of nearby villages (e.g. [[T\u00e1p\u00e9]], [[Sz\u0151reg]], [[Kiskundorozsma]], [[Szentmih\u00e1lytelek]], [[Gy\u00e1lar\u00e9t]]) were annexed to the city in 1973 (as was a tendency during the Communist era).\n\nToday's Szeged is an important university town and a popular tourist attraction.\n\nThe [[Szeged Symphony Orchestra]] (Szegedi Szimfonikus Zenekar) gives regular concerts at the Szegedi Nemzeti Sz\u00ednh\u00e1z.<ref>[http://www.symph-szeged.hu/ Szeged Symphony Orchestra website], accessed 6 August 2012.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSzeged is situated near the southern border of [[Hungary]], just to the south of the mouth of the [[Maros River]], on both banks of the [[Tisza River]], nearly in the centre of the [[Carpathian Basin]].

Two motorways, [[M5 motorway (Hungary)|M5]] and [[M43 motorway (Hungary)|M43]], lie along the city border. Through the [[M5 motorway (Hungary)|M5 Motorway]] Szeged is connected to [[Kecskem\u00e9t]], [[Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za]] and [[Budapest]] in the north direction and to [[Subotica]], [[Novi Sad]] and [[Beograd]] in [[Serbia]] in the south direction. Thanks to the [[M43 motorway (Hungary)|M43 Motorway]] - which splits from the M5 Motorway near Szeged - goes near [[Mak\u00f3]] to [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and [[Timisoara]] in [[Romania]].  In addition, there are other roads running from the city to Mak\u00f3 and [[Nagylak]] (Mainroad 43), to [[R\u00f6szke]] (Mainroad 5), to [[Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za]] (Mainroad 5), to [[\u00c1sotthalom]] and [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] (Mainroad 55) and to [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]], [[Orosh\u00e1za]] and [[B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba]] (Mainroad 47).\n\nThe Budapest-Szeged-rail line is an important rail connection, as well as the Railwaylines 121 (to Mak\u00f3), 135 (to H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely), 136 (to R\u00f6szke) and 140 (to Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za).<ref>[Rail transport map of Hungary by the Hungarian Rail Capacity Allocation Office (VPE)]</ref>\n\nA [[tram-train]] system is under construction to connect Szeged with the neighbouring [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]] and possibly [[Mak\u00f3]], thus creating the second most populous [[urban agglomeration]] in the country, after the capital.

[[Ptolemy]] mentions the oldest known name of the city: ''Partiscum.'' It is possible that [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], king of the [[Huns]] had his seat somewhere in this area. The name Szeged was first mentioned in 1183, in a document of King [[B\u00e9la III]].\n\nIn the second century AD there was a Roman trading post established on an island in the Tisza, and the foundations of the Szeged castle suggest that the structure may have been built over an even earlier fort. Today only one corner of the castle still remains standing.<ref>Szeged by Dr. Trogmayer Ott\u00f3</ref>\n\nDuring [[Mongol invasion of Europe|the Mongol invasion]] the town was destroyed and its inhabitants fled to the nearby swamps, but they soon returned and rebuilt their town. In the 14th century, during the reign of [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]], Szeged became the most important town of Southern Hungary, and \u2013 as the Turkish armies got closer to Hungary \u2013 the strategic importance of Szeged grew. King [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]] had a [[city wall|wall]] built around the town. Szeged was raised to [[free royal town]] status in 1498.\n\nSzeged was first pillaged by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] army on 28 September 1526, but was occupied only in 1543, and became an administrative centre of the Ottomans (see [[Ottoman Hungary]]). The town was a sanjak centre first in [[Budin Province, Ottoman Empire|Budin Eyaleti]] (1543\u20131596), after in [[E\u011fri Eyalet]]i. The town was freed from Turkish rule on 23 October 1686, and regained the free royal town status in 1715. In 1719, Szeged received its [[coat of arms]] (still used today) from [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles III]]. During the next several years, Szeged grew and prospered. [[Piarists|Piarist]] monks arrived in Szeged in 1719 and opened a new grammar school in 1721. Szeged also held scientific lectures and theatrical plays. These years brought not only prosperity but also enlightenment. Between 1728 and 1744 [[witch trial]]s were frequent in the town, with the [[Szeged witch trials]] of 1728-29 perhaps being the largest. The witch trials were instigated by the authorities, who decided on this measure to remove the problem of the public complaints about the drought and its consequences of famine and epidemics by laying the responsibility on people among them, which had fraternized with the Devil.  In 1720, the ethnic Hungarian population of the town numbered about 13000 to 16000, while the number of the Serb inhabitants was 1300.<ref>\u00c1d\u00e1m Fej\u00e9r, Magyarok \u00e9s szl\u00e1vok.

[[Lajos Kossuth]] delivered his famous speech here. Szeged was the last seat of the revolutionary government in July 1849. The [[Habsburg]] rulers punished the leaders of the town, but later Szeged began to prosper again, the railway reached it in 1854, and the town got its free royal town status back in 1860. Mark Pick's shop \u2013 the predecessor of today's world-famous Pick [[Salami]] Factory \u2013 was opened in 1869.\n[[File:Szeged, Dugonics t\u00e9r a nagy\u00e1rv\u00edzkor, szemben a K\u00e1lv\u00e1ria-sug\u00e1r\u00fat. Fortepan 15599.jpg|thumb|Szeged during the flood of 1879]]\nToday the inner city of Szeged has beautiful buildings and wide avenues. This is mainly due to the great [[flood]] of 1879, which literally wiped away the whole town (only 265 of the 5723 houses remained and 165 people died). Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] visited the town and promised that \"Szeged will be more beautiful than it used to be\". He kept his promise. During the next years a new, modern city emerged from the ruins, with palaces and wide streets.\n\n===During the 20th century===\n[[File:Sz\u00e9chenyi t\u00e9r, a Zs\u00f3t\u00e9r-h\u00e1z el\u0151tti sz\u00e9lesebb j\u00e1rda.

Fortepan 8569.jpg|thumb|Swimmers at Szeged, 1939]]\nAfter the [[Hungary in World War I|First World War]] Hungary lost its southern territories to [[Serbia]], as a result Szeged became a city close to the [[border]], and its importance lessened, but as it took over roles that formerly belonged to the now lost cities, it slowly recovered. Following the Loss of [[Transylvania]] to Romania, University of Kolozsv\u00e1r (now [[Cluj-Napoca]], moved to Szeged in 1921 (see [[University of Szeged]]). In 1923 Szeged took over the role of [[Bishop|episcopal]] seat from Temesv\u00e1r (now [[Timi\u0219oara]], Romania). It was briefly occupied by [[Romanian army]] during [[Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919|Hungarian-Romanian War]] in 1919. During the 1920s the Jewish population of Szeged grew and reached its zenith.\n\nSzeged suffered heavily during [[Hungary in World War II|World War II]]. 6,000 inhabitants of the city were killed, the Jewish citizens were confined to [[ghetto]]s and then taken to [[death camp]]s. Szeged was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[Steppe Front|2nd Ukrainian Front]] on 11 October 1944 in the course of the [[Battle of Debrecen]]. During the Communist-era, Szeged became a centre of [[light industry]] and [[food industry]]. In 1965 [[Petroleum|oil]] was found near the city.\n\nIn 1962, Szeged became the county seat of Csongr\u00e1d. Whole new districts were built, and lots of nearby villages (e.g. [[T\u00e1p\u00e9]], [[Sz\u0151reg]], [[Kiskundorozsma]], [[Szentmih\u00e1lytelek]], [[Gy\u00e1lar\u00e9t]]) were annexed to the city in 1973 (as was a tendency during the Communist era).\n\nToday's Szeged is an important university town and a popular tourist attraction.\n\nThe [[Szeged Symphony Orchestra]] (Szegedi Szimfonikus Zenekar) gives regular concerts at the Szegedi Nemzeti Sz\u00ednh\u00e1z.<ref>[http://www.symph-szeged.hu/ Szeged Symphony Orchestra website], accessed 6 August 2012.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSzeged is situated near the southern border of [[Hungary]], just to the south of the mouth of the [[Maros River]], on both banks of the [[Tisza River]], nearly in the centre of the [[Carpathian Basin]].

Two motorways, [[M5 motorway (Hungary)|M5]] and [[M43 motorway (Hungary)|M43]], lie along the city border. Through the [[M5 motorway (Hungary)|M5 Motorway]] Szeged is connected to [[Kecskem\u00e9t]], [[Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za]] and [[Budapest]] in the north direction and to [[Subotica]], [[Novi Sad]] and [[Beograd]] in [[Serbia]] in the south direction. Thanks to the [[M43 motorway (Hungary)|M43 Motorway]] - which splits from the M5 Motorway near Szeged - goes near [[Mak\u00f3]] to [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and [[Timisoara]] in [[Romania]].  In addition, there are other roads running from the city to Mak\u00f3 and [[Nagylak]] (Mainroad 43), to [[R\u00f6szke]] (Mainroad 5), to [[Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za]] (Mainroad 5), to [[\u00c1sotthalom]] and [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] (Mainroad 55) and to [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]], [[Orosh\u00e1za]] and [[B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba]] (Mainroad 47).\n\nThe Budapest-Szeged-rail line is an important rail connection, as well as the Railwaylines 121 (to Mak\u00f3), 135 (to H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely), 136 (to R\u00f6szke) and 140 (to Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za).<ref>[Rail transport map of Hungary by the Hungarian Rail Capacity Allocation Office (VPE)]</ref>\n\nA [[tram-train]] system is under construction to connect Szeged with the neighbouring [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]] and possibly [[Mak\u00f3]], thus creating the second most populous [[urban agglomeration]] in the country, after the capital. There was a proposal for its extension, even through the Serbian border, to [[Subotica]].\n\nThe city is also a common stop for national and international long-distance buses.\n\n===Motorways===\n* [[M5 motorway (Hungary)|M5]]\n* [[M43 motorway (Hungary)|M43]]\n\n===Railways===\n* 121 (to Mak\u00f3)\n* 135 (to H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely)\n* 136 (to R\u00f6szke)\n* 140 (to Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za).\n\n===Airport===\n[[Szeged Airport]] is the international airport of Szeged.\n\n===Public transport===\n{{See also|Public transport in Szeged}}\nAs of May 2018 Szeged had 39 local bus lines - 15 in the city centre and 24 in the suburbs.
