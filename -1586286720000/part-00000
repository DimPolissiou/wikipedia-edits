For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==Critical rationalism as a solution to the problem of induction==\nPopper noticed that two types of statements are of particular value to scientists. The first are statements of [[observation]]s, such as 'this is a white swan'. [[Logic|Logicians]] describe such statements in terms of [[existential quantification]], since they assert the ''existence'' of some particular thing. For Popper, such statements form the '''empirical basis''' of scientific theory.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=43}} The second type of statement of interest to scientists categorises all instances of something, for example \"All swans are white\". Logicians describe these in terms of [[universal quantification]].\n\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? From an existential statement to a universal statement? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would be to  [[Affirming the consequent|affirm the consequent]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> These observation or basic statements constitute the empirical \"basis\". The empirical basis thus depends on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nGiven an empirical basis, the criterion of demarcation draws a sharp line between those theories that are scientific, and those that are un-scientific.  It is useful to know if a statement or theory is falsifiable, if, for no other reason, than that it provides us with an understanding of the ways in which one might assess the theory. One might at the least be saved from attempting to falsify a non-falsifiable theory. Popper claimed that, if a theory is falsifiable, then it is scientific.\n\nThe demarcation criterion excludes theories that we cannot declare scientific, but it does not say which scientific theories we must keep. For Popper, no methodology rigorously describes the choices made by scientists and he never tried to prescribe such a methodology: he always insisted that the methodology can hardly made rigorous.  In particular, a scientific theory that is  falsified remains scientific and can still be used in science.  This view was in contradistinction to the claimed rigor of the inductive methodology of the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]]. \n\n===Historical context : logical positivism===\nIn the [[philosophy of science]], verificationism holds that a statement must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific.\nThis was an essential feature of the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n===Demarcation and growth of knowledge===\nIn contradistinction with the verificationists, Popper never meant that science grows by applying fixed logical rules to scientific statements or theories.  In Popper's view, unfalsifiable systems such as logic, mathematics and metaphysics, which have not themselves emerged from fixed logical rules only, play a role in the growth of science. He wrote that important ''metaphysical research programmes'' have influenced the development of physics since the days of Pythagoras and Heraclitus.{{sfn|Popper|1982|p=162}}  Thornton explains{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 3}} that science, like virtually every other human, and indeed organic, activity, Popper believes, consists largely of problem-solving. Science, in Popper's view, starts with problems rather than with observations.  Problems emerge from internal conflicts in the theory, between the theory and the metaphysical program or between the theory and observations.<ref name=\"problemsemergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In the latter case, these observations do not come first. Thornton writes that, for Popper, \"it is in the context of grappling with a problem that the scientist makes observations in the first instance: his observations are selectively designed to test the extent to which a given theory functions as a satisfactory solution to a given problem.\"\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert.\"}}\n\n===Economics===\n[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from scientific to unscientific.{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: \"For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents. [[J.B.S.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]]. [[Albert Einstein]] wrote, \"One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.\"{{sfn|Einstein|2010}}\n\n{{See also|Mathematical proof|Scientific method#Relationship with mathematics|l2=Scientific method and mathematics|Mathematics#Mathematics as science|l3=Mathematics as science|Philosophy of mathematics#Popper's_two_senses_of_number_statements|l4=Popper's \"two senses\" theory}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Black swan theory}}\n* {{annotated link|Contingency (philosophy)|Contingency}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical rationalism}}\n* {{annotated link|Defeasible reasoning}}\n* {{annotated link|Duhem\u2013Quine thesis}}\n* {{annotated link|Experimentum crucis|''Experimentum crucis''}}\n* {{annotated link|Explanatory power}}\n* {{annotated link|Fallibilism}}\n* {{annotated link|Fallacy}} ([[informal logic]] and [[rhetoric]])\n* {{annotated link|Raven paradox}}, or Hempel's paradox\n* {{annotated link|Hitchens's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Hypothetico-deductive model}}\n* {{annotated link|Inquiry}}\n* {{annotated link|Metaphysical solipsism}}\n* {{annotated link|Methodological solipsism}}\n* {{annotated link|Mike Alder|Newton's Flaming Laser Sword}}\n* {{annotated link|Occam's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of mathematics}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of science}}\n* {{annotated link|Pragmatic maxim}}\n* {{annotated link|Precambrian rabbit}}\n* {{annotated link|Predictive power}}\n* {{annotated link|Reproducibility}}\n* {{annotated link|Russell's teapot}}\n* {{annotated link|Superseded scientific theories}}\n* {{annotated link|Tautology (logic)|Tautology}}\n* {{annotated link|Theory-ladenness}}\n* {{annotated link|Trial and error}}\n{{div col end}}\n{{Wiktionary pipe | falsifiable | falsifiability}}\n{{clear}}\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist| group=upper-alpha| refs=\n\n<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> {{harvnb|Watkins|1970|p=28}} : \n\"Thus we have the following clash: the condition which Kuhn regards as the normal and proper condition of science is a condition which, if it\nactually obtained, Popper would regard as unscientific, a state of affairs in which critical science had contracted into defensive metaphysics.

For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==Critical rationalism as a solution to the problem of induction==\nPopper noticed that two types of statements are of particular value to scientists. The first are statements of [[observation]]s, such as 'this is a white swan'. [[Logic|Logicians]] describe such statements in terms of [[existential quantification]], since they assert the ''existence'' of some particular thing. For Popper, such statements form the '''empirical basis''' of scientific theory.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=43}} The second type of statement of interest to scientists categorises all instances of something, for example \"All swans are white\". Logicians describe these in terms of [[universal quantification]].\n\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? From an existential statement to a universal statement? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would be to  [[Affirming the consequent|affirm the consequent]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> These observation or basic statements constitute the empirical \"basis\". The empirical basis thus depends on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nGiven an empirical basis, the criterion of demarcation draws a sharp line between those theories that are scientific, and those that are un-scientific.  It is useful to know if a statement or theory is falsifiable, if, for no other reason, than that it provides us with an understanding of the ways in which one might assess the theory. One might at the least be saved from attempting to falsify a non-falsifiable theory. Popper claimed that, if a theory is falsifiable, then it is scientific.\n\nThe demarcation criterion excludes theories that we cannot declare scientific, but it does not say which scientific theories we must keep. For Popper, no methodology rigorously describes the choices made by scientists and he never tried to prescribe such a methodology: he always insisted that the methodology can hardly made rigorous.  In particular, a scientific theory that is  falsified remains scientific and can still be used in science.  This view was in contradistinction to the claimed rigor of the inductive methodology of the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]]. \n\n===Historical context : logical positivism===\nIn the [[philosophy of science]], verificationism holds that a statement must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific.\nThis was an essential feature of the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n===Demarcation and growth of knowledge===\nIn contradistinction with the verificationists, Popper never meant that science grows by applying fixed logical rules to scientific statements or theories.  In Popper's view, unfalsifiable systems such as logic, mathematics and metaphysics, which have not themselves emerged from fixed logical rules only, play a role in the growth of science. He wrote that important ''metaphysical research programmes'' have influenced the development of physics since the days of Pythagoras and Heraclitus.{{sfn|Popper|1982|p=162}}  Thornton explains{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 3}} that science, like virtually every other human, and indeed organic, activity, Popper believes, consists largely of problem-solving. Science, in Popper's view, starts with problems rather than with observations.  Problems emerge from internal conflicts in the theory, between the theory and the metaphysical program or between the theory and observations.<ref name=\"problemsemergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In the latter case, these observations do not come first. Thornton writes that, for Popper, \"it is in the context of grappling with a problem that the scientist makes observations in the first instance: his observations are selectively designed to test the extent to which a given theory functions as a satisfactory solution to a given problem.\"\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v.

In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert.\"}}\n\n===Economics===\n[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from scientific to unscientific.{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: \"For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents. [[J.B.S. Haldane]], when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied \"[[precambrian rabbit|fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era]]\".{{sfn|Ridley|2003}} [[Richard Dawkins]] adds that any other modern animal, such as a hippo, would suffice.{{sfn|Wallis|2005}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1995}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1986}} [[Karl Popper]] at first spoke against the testability of natural selection{{sfn|Popper|1982b}}{{sfn|Popper|1976}} but recanted, \"I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a recantation.\"{{sfn|Popper|1978}}\n\n===Young-earth creationism===\n{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}\nMuch of the criticism against [[young-Earth creationism]] is based on evidence in nature that the Earth is much older than adherents believe.  Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

{"title_page": "Cieplak effect", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn [[organic chemistry]], the '''Cieplak effect''' is a predictive model that explains why [[nucleophiles]] preferentially add to one face of a [[carbonyl]] over another. Proposed by Andrzej Stanislaw Cieplak in 1980, it explains anomalous results that other models of the time, such as the [[Cram's rule of asymmetric induction|Cram]] and [[Asymmetric induction|Felkin\u2013Anh]] models, cannot justify. In the Cieplak model, [[electrons]] from a neighboring bond [[delocalize]] into the forming carbon\u2013nucleophile (C\u2013Nuc) bond, lowering the energy of the [[transition state]] and accelerating the rate of reaction.<ref name=\"test\">Cieplak, A. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981, 103, 4540</ref> Whichever bond can best donate its electrons into the C\u2013Nuc bond determines which face of the carbonyl the nucleophile will add to. The nucleophile may be a number of reagents, most commonly organometallic or [[reducing agent]]s. The Cieplak effect is subtle, and often competes with [[sterics]], solvent effects, [[counterion]] complexation of the carbonyl oxygen, and other effects to determine product distribution.\n\n== Background ==\nThe Cieplak effect relies on the stabilizing interaction of mixing full and empty [[Molecular orbital|orbital]]s to delocalize electrons, known as [[hyperconjugation]].<ref>Alabugin, I. V.; Gilmore, K. M.; Peterson, P. W. WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci. 2011, 1, 109</ref> When the highest occupied molecular orbital ([[HOMO/LUMO|HOMO]]) of one system and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ([[HOMO/LUMO|LUMO]]) of another system have comparable energies and spatial overlap, the electrons can delocalize and sink into a lower energy level. Often, the HOMO of a system is a full [[Sigma bond|\u03c3]] (bonding) orbital and the LUMO is an empty [[Antibonding molecular orbital|\u03c3*]] (antibonding) orbital. This mixing is a stabilizing interaction and has been widely used to explain such phenomena as the [[Anomeric effect|anomeric]] effect. A common requirement of hyperconjugation is that the bonds donating and accepting electron density are [[antiperiplanar]] to each other, to allow for maximum orbital overlap.\n[[File:Orbital Stabilization by Hyperconjugation.gif|center]]\n\nThe Cieplak effect uses hyperconjugation to explain the face-selective addition of nucleophiles to carbonyl carbons. Specifically, donation into the low-lying \u03c3*<sub>C-Nuc</sub> bond by antiperiplanar electron-donating substituents is the stabilizing interaction which lowers the transition state energy of one stereospecific reaction pathway and thus increases the rate of attack from one side. In the simplest model, a conformationally constrained [[cyclohexanone]] is reduced to the corresponding [[alcohol]]. Reducing agents add a [[hydride]] to the carbonyl carbon via attack along the [[Burgi\u2013Dunitz angle]], which can come from the top along a pseudo-axial trajectory or from below, along a pseudo-equatorial trajectory. It has long been known that large reducing agents add hydride to the equatorial position to avoid steric interactions with axial hydrogens on the ring. Small hydride sources, however, add hydride to an axial position for reasons which are still disputed.<ref>Eliel, E. L.; Senda, Y. Tetrahedron 1970, 26, 2411</ref>\n[[File:Effect of Reagent Size on Cyclohexanone Reduction.gif|center]]\n\nThe Cieplak effect explains this phenomenon by postulating that hyperconjugation of the forming \u03c3*<sub>C\u2013H</sub> orbital with geometrically aligned \u03c3 orbitals is the stabilizing interaction that controls [[stereoselectivity]]. In an equatorial approach, the bonds that are geometrically aligned antiperiplanar to the forming C\u2013H bond are the C\u2013C bonds of the ring, so they donate electron density to \u03c3*<sub>C\u2013H</sub>. In an axial approach, the neighboring axial C\u2013H bonds are aligned antiperiplanar to the forming C\u2013H bond, so they donate electron density to \u03c3*<sub>C\u2013H</sub>. Because C-H bonds are better [[electron donors]] than C\u2013C bonds, they are better able to participate in this stabilizing interaction and so this pathway is favored.<ref name=\"test\" />\n[[File:Axial vs Equatorial Approach in the Cieplak Model.gif|center]]\n\n== Evidence ==\nCieplak's proposal is supported by investigating the effects of various electronic substituents on product distribution. By installing an electron-withdrawing substituent such as a [[methoxy group]] at the C2 position, the reduction of substituted cyclohexanones begins to favor equatorial attack.<ref>Senda, Y.; Nakano, S.; Kunii, H.; Itoh, H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1993, 2, 1009</ref> This is because the axial C-O bond is a worse electron donor than a C\u2013C bond, so axial attack is less favored. \n[[File:Axial Reduction of Substituted Cyclohexanones.gif|center]]\n\nCieplak also demonstrated this effect by introducing electron withdrawing substituents on C3, which decrease the electron-donating capability of the ring C\u2013C bond and therefore disfavor equatorial attack, which is antiperiplanar to this bond.<ref>Johnson, C. R.; Tait, B. D.; Cieplak, A. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 5875</ref> Electron-donating substituents at C3 subsequently favor equatorial approach, since increasing C\u2013C electron density favors \u03c3<sub>C-C</sub> donation into \u03c3*<sub>C-Nuc</sub> and thereby encourages equatorial approach.\n[[File:Axial Attack of Methylenecyclohexane.gif|center]]\n\nThis effect can also be investigated by changing the electronic nature of the nucleophile. In the case of an [[electron-deficient]] nucleophile, the \u03c3* of the forming C-Nuc bond is lower in energy and better stabilized by attack antiperiplanar to [[electron-rich]] axial C-H bonds. Attack therefore occurs axially.<ref>Favre, H.; Gravel, D. Can. J. Chem. 1961, 39, 1548</ref> If the nucleophile is electron-rich, however, the donation of more [[electron density]] is less favored and equatorial attack may prevail.<ref>Meakins, G. D.; Percy, R. K.; Richards, E. E.;Young, R. N. J. Chem. Soc. C, 1968, 1106</ref> These trends have been observed even when normalizing for steric bulk of the nucleophile.<ref name=\"test\" />\n[[File:Effect of Nucleophilicity on Axial Attack.gif|center]]\n\nIn substituted norbornones, nucleophilic attack will come antiperiplanar to the bonds which can best donate into \u03c3*<sub>C-Nuc</sub>.<ref>G. Mehta, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990, 112, 6140</ref> The bonds positioned for this interaction are the [[bridgehead]] C\u2013C bonds on the six-membered ring. Substituents which donate electron density to these bonds, such as [[Ethyl group|ethyl]] groups, increase the rate of addition [[Syn and anti addition|anti]] to the alkyl groups, which is the antiperiplanar trajectory. If electron-withdrawing substituents such as [[ester]]s are appended to the C\u2013C bonds, however, the selectivity favors [[Syn and anti addition|syn]] addition, so that the bonds donating into \u03c3*<sub>C-Nuc</sub> are the more electron-rich C\u2013C bonds which are hydrogen-substituted.<ref>Kaselj, M.; Chung, W-S.; le Noble, W. J. Chem. Rev. 1999, 99, 1387</ref>\n[[File:Nucleophilic Attack of Substituted Norbornones.gif|center]]\n\nA similar example is seen in substituted 2-adamantones, where varying the electronic properties at the remote 5 position has profound effects on product distribution.<ref>Cheung, C. K.; Tseng, L. T.; Lin, M. H.; Srivsstava, S.; le Noble, W. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986, 108, 1598</ref> A [[hydroxyl]] group is able to donate electron density [[Inductive effect|inductively]] to the forming \u03c3*<sub>C\u2013H</sub> bond antiperiplanar, so attack from that side is favored. The electron-withdrawing ester substituent, however, lacks this stabilization ability. Instead, the C\u2013H bonds are better electron donors than the C\u2013CO<sub>2</sub>Me bonds, so attack comes anti to the hydrogen substituents and subsequently syn to the ester group. This explains the effect of remote electron-donor groups on stereochemical outcomes, which has been difficult to explain with other stereochemical models. The rigidity of the adamantone skeleton allows for tight control of conformation and minimization of competing effects.<ref>Srivastava, S.; le Noble, W. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 5874</ref>\n[[File:Reduction of Substituted Adamantones.gif|center]]\n\n== Criticisms ==\nThe Cieplak model has been met with mixed reviews, and criticisms of both its basic logic and predictive ability have emerged. The stabilizing interaction of donating electron density into the transition state \u03c3* orbital of a forming bond was immediately questioned, as this interaction has been widely invoked to explain exactly the opposite\u2014the destabilization of bonds.<ref>Frenking, G.; Kohler, K. F.; Reetz, M. T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991, 30, 1146</ref> Traditionally, forming bonds are stabilized when they donate electron density from their bonding HOMO into a neighboring antibonding LUMO, not by accepting electron density into their LUMO. To this end, [[David A. Evans]] said of Cieplak's proposal: \"Structures are stabilized by stabilizing their highest energy filled states. This is one of the fundamental assumptions in [[frontier molecular orbital theory]]. The Cieplak hypothesis is nonsense.\"<ref>Siska, S. (2001, February). The Evolution of Models for Carbonyl Addition. Evans Group Afternoon Seminar. Lecture conducted from Harvard University, Cambridge, MA</ref><ref>Evans, D. A. ''Chemistry 206 Lecture Notes'' (2006), Lecture 22 \"Carbonyl and Azomethine Electrophiles-2\". </ref> However, Hahn and le Noble refute this point by invoking the principle of [[microscopic reversibility]], where the process of bond formation and cleavage are fundamentally equivalent in an [[Equilibrium chemistry|equilibrium]], and little value should be placed on the terms \u2018bonding\u2019 and \u2018antibonding\u2019, \u03c3 or \u03c3*.<ref>Hahn, J. M.; le Noble. W. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 1916</ref> In another criticism of the model, Houk questions Cieplak's fundamental assumption that C-H bonds are better electron-donors than C-C bonds.<ref>Rozeboom, M. D.; Houk, K. N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982, 104, 1189</ref> This point is still contested and represents another major dispute in the field.\n\nTo further refute the Cieplak effect, Houk puts forth a system in which Cieplak's model predicts the wrong product distribution trend. In the case of substituted trans-decalones, electron-withdrawing substituents equatorial at C4 should discourage equatorial attack and yield more axial product, since the ring C\u2013C bonds are deactivated for donation into the forming C-Nuc bond. Experimental evidence, however, shows that axial electron-withdrawing C4 substituents are more directing towards axial attack than equatorial substituents.<ref name=\"test2\">Wu, Y-D.; Tucker, J. A.; Houk, K. N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 5018</ref> Since axial orbitals are not aligned for hyperconjugation in this system, Houk rationalized this trend by invoking electrostatic arguments, described below.\n[[File:Reduction of Substituted Trans-Decalones.gif|center]]\n\n== Alternative explanations ==\nIn an effort to explain the surprising stereoselectivies in the systems above, alternative explanations to the Cieplak effect have been proposed. In substituted cyclohexanones, the tendency of small reducing agents to add hydride axially is proposed to be caused by [[Strain (chemistry)#Torsional strain|torsional strain]] instead of hyperconjugation.<ref>Juaristi, E. Conformational Behavior of Six-Membered Rings. Wiley, 1995. Online.</ref> In an equatorial attack, the nucleophile approaches by [[Eclipsed conformation|eclipsing]] a neighboring hydrogen atom and subsequently pushes the carbonyl substituents into ecplising positions as it [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|pyramidalizes]] the carbonyl carbon.<ref>Wigfield, D. C. Tetrahedron 1979, 35, 449</ref> In an axial approach, the nucleophile approaches [[Gauche conformation|gauche]] to neighboring hydrogen atoms and so does not cause eclipsing interactions while pyramidalizing the carbonyl carbon. It is this torsional strain\u2014the energy cost of rotating the bonds out of an eclipsed position\u2014that favors axial over equatorial approach.\n\nIn the case of substituted norbornones, stereoselectivity may be explained by [[electrostatic interactions]] between substituents and nucleophiles. Electron-withdrawing groups create a [[partial charge|partial positive charge]] on the [[alpha carbon]], which interacts favorably with the [[partial charge|partial negative charge]] on the incoming nucleophile.<ref>Paddon-Row, M. N.; Wu, Y-D.; Houk, K. N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 10638</ref> This interaction may guide attack syn to the electron-withdrawing substituent, and anti to electron-donating substituents.

Proposed by Andrzej Stanislaw Cieplak in 1980, it explains anomalous results that other models of the time, such as the [[Cram's rule of asymmetric induction|Cram]] and [[Asymmetric induction|Felkin\u2013Anh]] models, cannot justify. In the Cieplak model, [[electrons]] from a neighboring bond [[delocalize]] into the forming carbon\u2013nucleophile (C\u2013Nuc) bond, lowering the energy of the [[transition state]] and accelerating the rate of reaction.<ref name=\"test\">Cieplak, A. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981, 103, 4540</ref> Whichever bond can best donate its electrons into the C\u2013Nuc bond determines which face of the carbonyl the nucleophile will add to. The nucleophile may be a number of reagents, most commonly organometallic or [[reducing agent]]s. The Cieplak effect is subtle, and often competes with [[sterics]], solvent effects, [[counterion]] complexation of the carbonyl oxygen, and other effects to determine product distribution.\n\n== Background ==\nThe Cieplak effect relies on the stabilizing interaction of mixing full and empty [[Molecular orbital|orbital]]s to delocalize electrons, known as [[hyperconjugation]].<ref>Alabugin, I. V.; Gilmore, K. M.; Peterson, P. W. WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci. 2011, 1, 109</ref> When the highest occupied molecular orbital ([[HOMO/LUMO|HOMO]]) of one system and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ([[HOMO/LUMO|LUMO]]) of another system have comparable energies and spatial overlap, the electrons can delocalize and sink into a lower energy level. Often, the HOMO of a system is a full [[Sigma bond|\u03c3]] (bonding) orbital and the LUMO is an empty [[Antibonding molecular orbital|\u03c3*]] (antibonding) orbital. This mixing is a stabilizing interaction and has been widely used to explain such phenomena as the [[Anomeric effect|anomeric]] effect. A common requirement of hyperconjugation is that the bonds donating and accepting electron density are [[antiperiplanar]] to each other, to allow for maximum orbital overlap.\n[[File:Orbital Stabilization by Hyperconjugation.gif|center]]\n\nThe Cieplak effect uses hyperconjugation to explain the face-selective addition of nucleophiles to carbonyl carbons. Specifically, donation into the low-lying \u03c3*<sub>C-Nuc</sub> bond by antiperiplanar electron-donating substituents is the stabilizing interaction which lowers the transition state energy of one stereospecific reaction pathway and thus increases the rate of attack from one side. In the simplest model, a conformationally constrained [[cyclohexanone]] is reduced to the corresponding [[alcohol]]. Reducing agents add a [[hydride]] to the carbonyl carbon via attack along the [[Burgi\u2013Dunitz angle]], which can come from the top along a pseudo-axial trajectory or from below, along a pseudo-equatorial trajectory. It has long been known that large reducing agents add hydride to the equatorial position to avoid steric interactions with axial hydrogens on the ring. Small hydride sources, however, add hydride to an axial position for reasons which are still disputed.<ref>Eliel, E. L.; Senda, Y. Tetrahedron 1970, 26, 2411</ref>\n[[File:Effect of Reagent Size on Cyclohexanone Reduction.gif|center]]\n\nThe Cieplak effect explains this phenomenon by postulating that hyperconjugation of the forming \u03c3*<sub>C\u2013H</sub> orbital with geometrically aligned \u03c3 orbitals is the stabilizing interaction that controls [[stereoselectivity]]. In an equatorial approach, the bonds that are geometrically aligned antiperiplanar to the forming C\u2013H bond are the C\u2013C bonds of the ring, so they donate electron density to \u03c3*<sub>C\u2013H</sub>. In an axial approach, the neighboring axial C\u2013H bonds are aligned antiperiplanar to the forming C\u2013H bond, so they donate electron density to \u03c3*<sub>C\u2013H</sub>. Because C-H bonds are better [[electron donors]] than C\u2013C bonds, they are better able to participate in this stabilizing interaction and so this pathway is favored.<ref name=\"test\" />\n[[File:Axial vs Equatorial Approach in the Cieplak Model.gif|center]]\n\n== Evidence ==\nCieplak\u2019s proposal is supported by investigating the effects of various electronic substituents on product distribution. By installing an electron-withdrawing substituent such as a [[methoxy group]] at the C2 position, the reduction of substituted cyclohexanones begins to favor equatorial attack.<ref>Senda, Y.; Nakano, S.; Kunii, H.; Itoh, H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1993, 2, 1009</ref> This is because the axial C-O bond is a worse electron donor than a C\u2013C bond, so axial attack is less favored. \n[[File:Axial Reduction of Substituted Cyclohexanones.gif|center]]\n\nCieplak also demonstrated this effect by introducing electron withdrawing substituents on C3, which decrease the electron-donating capability of the ring C\u2013C bond and therefore disfavor equatorial attack, which is antiperiplanar to this bond.<ref>Johnson, C. R.; Tait, B. D.; Cieplak, A. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 5875</ref> Electron-donating substituents at C3 subsequently favor equatorial approach, since increasing C\u2013C electron density favors \u03c3<sub>C-C</sub> donation into \u03c3*<sub>C-Nuc</sub> and thereby encourages equatorial approach.\n[[File:Axial Attack of Methylenecyclohexane.gif|center]]\n\nThis effect can also be investigated by changing the electronic nature of the nucleophile. In the case of an [[electron-deficient]] nucleophile, the \u03c3* of the forming C-Nuc bond is lower in energy and better stabilized by attack antiperiplanar to [[electron-rich]] axial C-H bonds. Attack therefore occurs axially.<ref>Favre, H.; Gravel, D. Can. J. Chem. 1961, 39, 1548</ref> If the nucleophile is electron-rich, however, the donation of more [[electron density]] is less favored and equatorial attack may prevail.<ref>Meakins, G. D.; Percy, R. K.; Richards, E. E.;Young, R. N. J. Chem. Soc. C, 1968, 1106</ref> These trends have been observed even when normalizing for steric bulk of the nucleophile.<ref name=\"test\" />\n[[File:Effect of Nucleophilicity on Axial Attack.gif|center]]\n\nIn substituted norbornones, nucleophilic attack will come antiperiplanar to the bonds which can best donate into \u03c3*<sub>C-Nuc</sub>.<ref>G. Mehta, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990, 112, 6140</ref> The bonds positioned for this interaction are the [[bridgehead]] C\u2013C bonds on the six-membered ring. Substituents which donate electron density to these bonds, such as [[Ethyl group|ethyl]] groups, increase the rate of addition [[Syn and anti addition|anti]] to the alkyl groups, which is the antiperiplanar trajectory. If electron-withdrawing substituents such as [[ester]]s are appended to the C\u2013C bonds, however, the selectivity favors [[Syn and anti addition|syn]] addition, so that the bonds donating into \u03c3*<sub>C-Nuc</sub> are the more electron-rich C\u2013C bonds which are hydrogen-substituted.<ref>Kaselj, M.; Chung, W-S.; le Noble, W. J. Chem. Rev. 1999, 99, 1387</ref>\n[[File:Nucleophilic Attack of Substituted Norbornones.gif|center]]\n\nA similar example is seen in substituted 2-adamantones, where varying the electronic properties at the remote 5 position has profound effects on product distribution.<ref>Cheung, C. K.; Tseng, L. T.; Lin, M. H.; Srivsstava, S.; le Noble, W. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986, 108, 1598</ref> A [[hydroxyl]] group is able to donate electron density [[Inductive effect|inductively]] to the forming \u03c3*<sub>C\u2013H</sub> bond antiperiplanar, so attack from that side is favored. The electron-withdrawing ester substituent, however, lacks this stabilization ability. Instead, the C\u2013H bonds are better electron donors than the C\u2013CO<sub>2</sub>Me bonds, so attack comes anti to the hydrogen substituents and subsequently syn to the ester group. This explains the effect of remote electron-donor groups on stereochemical outcomes, which has been difficult to explain with other stereochemical models. The rigidity of the adamantone skeleton allows for tight control of conformation and minimization of competing effects.<ref>Srivastava, S.; le Noble, W. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 5874</ref>\n[[File:Reduction of Substituted Adamantones.gif|center]]\n\n== Criticisms ==\nThe Cieplak model has been met with mixed reviews, and criticisms of both its basic logic and predictive ability have emerged. The stabilizing interaction of donating electron density into the transition state \u03c3* orbital of a forming bond was immediately questioned, as this interaction has been widely invoked to explain exactly the opposite\u2014the destabilization of bonds.<ref>Frenking, G.; Kohler, K. F.; Reetz, M. T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991, 30, 1146</ref> Traditionally, forming bonds are stabilized when they donate electron density from their bonding HOMO into a neighboring antibonding LUMO, not by accepting electron density into their LUMO. To this end, [[David A. Evans]] said of Cieplak\u2019s proposal: \"Structures are stabilized by stabilizing their highest energy filled states. This is one of the fundamental assumptions in [[frontier molecular orbital theory]]. The Cieplak hypothesis is nonsense.\"<ref>Siska, S. (2001, February). The Evolution of Models for Carbonyl Addition. Evans Group Afternoon Seminar. Lecture conducted from Harvard University, Cambridge, MA</ref><ref>Evans, D. A. ''Chemistry 206 Lecture Notes'' (2006), Lecture 22 \"Carbonyl and Azomethine Electrophiles-2\". </ref> However, Hahn and le Noble refute this point by invoking the principle of [[microscopic reversibility]], where the process of bond formation and cleavage are fundamentally equivalent in an [[Equilibrium chemistry|equilibrium]], and little value should be placed on the terms \u2018bonding\u2019 and \u2018antibonding\u2019, \u03c3 or \u03c3*.<ref>Hahn, J. M.; le Noble. W. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 1916</ref> In another criticism of the model, Houk questions Cieplak\u2019s fundamental assumption that C-H bonds are better electron-donors than C-C bonds.<ref>Rozeboom, M. D.; Houk, K. N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982, 104, 1189</ref> This point is still contested and represents another major dispute in the field.\n\nTo further refute the Cieplak effect, Houk puts forth a system in which Cieplak\u2019s model predicts the wrong product distribution trend. In the case of substituted trans-decalones, electron-withdrawing substituents equatorial at C4 should discourage equatorial attack and yield more axial product, since the ring C\u2013C bonds are deactivated for donation into the forming C-Nuc bond. Experimental evidence, however, shows that axial electron-withdrawing C4 substituents are more directing towards axial attack than equatorial substituents.<ref name=\"test2\">Wu, Y-D.; Tucker, J. A.; Houk, K. N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 5018</ref> Since axial orbitals are not aligned for hyperconjugation in this system, Houk rationalized this trend by invoking electrostatic arguments, described below.\n[[File:Reduction of Substituted Trans-Decalones.gif|center]]\n\n== Alternative explanations ==\nIn an effort to explain the surprising stereoselectivies in the systems above, alternative explanations to the Cieplak effect have been proposed. In substituted cyclohexanones, the tendency of small reducing agents to add hydride axially is proposed to be caused by [[Strain (chemistry)#Torsional strain|torsional strain]] instead of hyperconjugation.<ref>Juaristi, E. Conformational Behavior of Six-Membered Rings. Wiley, 1995. Online.</ref> In an equatorial attack, the nucleophile approaches by [[Eclipsed conformation|eclipsing]] a neighboring hydrogen atom and subsequently pushes the carbonyl substituents into ecplising positions as it [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|pyramidalizes]] the carbonyl carbon.<ref>Wigfield, D. C. Tetrahedron 1979, 35, 449</ref> In an axial approach, the nucleophile approaches [[Gauche conformation|gauche]] to neighboring hydrogen atoms and so does not cause eclipsing interactions while pyramidalizing the carbonyl carbon. It is this torsional strain\u2014the energy cost of rotating the bonds out of an eclipsed position\u2014that favors axial over equatorial approach.\n\nIn the case of substituted norbornones, stereoselectivity may be explained by [[electrostatic interactions]] between substituents and nucleophiles. Electron-withdrawing groups create a [[partial charge|partial positive charge]] on the [[alpha carbon]], which interacts favorably with the [[partial charge|partial negative charge]] on the incoming nucleophile.<ref>Paddon-Row, M. N.; Wu, Y-D.; Houk, K. N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 10638</ref> This interaction may guide attack syn to the electron-withdrawing substituent, and anti to electron-donating substituents. This conclusion is supported by [[Computational chemistry|computations]], where modeling the partial charges predicts product distribution without including orbital interactions.<ref>Ganguly, B.; Chandrasekhar, J.; Khan, F. A.; Mehta, G. J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58, 1734</ref> The same explanation has been made to justify similar results in the case of substituted adamantones.<ref>Adcock, W.; Cotton, J.; Trout, N. A. J. Org.

A fine [[lithography|lithograph]]er, Delacroix illustrated various works of [[William Shakespeare]], the Scottish author [[Walter Scott]] and the German author [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].\n\nIn contrast to the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] perfectionism of his chief rival [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and painters of the Venetian [[Renaissance]], with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic.<ref>Gombrich, E.H., ''The Story of Art'', pages 504\u20136.

Harper and Row, 1969.</ref>\n\nHowever, Delacroix was given to neither sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], \"Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible.\"<ref>Wellington, Hubert, ''The Journal of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix'', introduction, page xiv.

Delacroix who at the time suffered from erectile dysfunction returned to Paris in early September 1797, only to find his wife pregnant.

His legitimate father, Charles Delacroix, died in 1805, and his mother in 1814, leaving 16-year-old Eug\u00e8ne an orphan.\n\nHis early education was at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand]], and at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Corneille (Rouen)|Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Corneille]] in Rouen<ref name=\"LyCo6\">{{cite web|url=http://lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr/spip.php?article6|title=Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Corneille de Rouen \u2013 The Lyc\u00e9e Corneille of Rouen|work=ac-rouen.fr}}</ref> where he steeped himself in the classics and won awards for drawing. In 1815 he began his training with [[Pierre-Narcisse Gu\u00e9rin]] in the neoclassical style of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. An early church commission, ''The Virgin of the Harvest'' (1819), displays a [[Raphael]]-esque influence, but another such commission, ''The Virgin of the Sacred Heart'' (1821), evidences a freer interpretation.<ref>Jobert, Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my, ''Delacroix'', page 62. Princeton University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-691-00418-8}}</ref> It precedes the influence of the more colourful and rich style of the Flemish Baroque painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and fellow French artist [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]], whose works marked an introduction to Romanticism in art.\n\nThe impact of G\u00e9ricault's ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' was profound, and stimulated Delacroix to produce his first major painting, ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'', which was accepted by the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] in 1822. The work caused a sensation, and was largely derided by the public and officialdom, yet was purchased by the State for the [[Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg|Luxembourg Galleries]]; the pattern of widespread opposition to his work, countered by a vigorous, enlightened support, would continue throughout his life.<ref name=\"wellington_xii\">Wellington, page xii.</ref> Two years later he again achieved popular success for his ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]''.\n\n==Career==\n===''Chios'' and ''Missolonghi''===\n[[Image:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|''[[The Massacre at Chios|Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824), [[Louvre]]]]\nDelacroix's painting of [[Chios Massacre|the massacre]] at [[Chios]] shows sick, dying Greek civilians about to be slaughtered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. One of several paintings he made of this contemporary event, expressed the official policy for the Greek cause in [[Greek War of Independence|their war of independence]] against the Turks, war sustained by English, Russian and French governments. Delacroix was quickly recognized by the authorities as a leading painter in the new Romantic style, and the picture was bought by the state. His depiction of suffering was controversial, however, as there was no glorious event taking place, no patriots raising their swords in valour as in [[Jacques-Louis David|David's]] ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', only a disaster. Many critics deplored the painting's despairing tone; the artist [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] called it \"a massacre of art\".<ref name=\"wellington_xii\" /> The pathos in the depiction of an infant clutching its dead mother's breast had an especially powerful effect, although this detail was condemned as unfit for art by Delacroix's critics. A viewing of the paintings of [[John Constable]] and the watercolour sketches and art of [[Richard Parkes Bonnington]] prompted Delacroix to make extensive, freely painted changes to the sky and distant landscape.<ref>Wellington, pages xii, 16.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 017.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi]]'' (1826), [[Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Bordeaux|Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts]], [[Bordeaux]]]]\n\nDelacroix produced a second painting in support of the Greeks in their war for independence, this time referring to the capture of [[Missolonghi]] by Turkish forces in 1825.<ref>Jobert, page 127.</ref> With a restraint of palette appropriate to the allegory, ''Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi'' displays a woman in Greek costume with her breast bared, arms half-raised in an imploring gesture before the horrible scene: the suicide of the Greeks, who chose to kill themselves and destroy their city rather than surrender to the Turks. A hand is seen at the bottom, the body having been crushed by rubble. The painting serves as a monument to the people of Missolonghi and to the idea of freedom against tyrannical rule. This event interested Delacroix not only for his sympathies with the Greeks, but also because the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], whom Delacroix greatly admired, had died there.<ref name=\"Noon58\" />\n\n===Romanticism===\n[[File:Ferdinand-Victor-Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, French - The Death of Sardanapalus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'' (1827), [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]\n[[File:Eugene Delacroix - Horse Frightened by Lightning - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Horse Frightened by a Storm'', watercolour, 1824]]\nA trip to England in 1825 included visits to [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Thomas Lawrence]] and [[Richard Parkes Bonington]], and the colour and handling of English painting provided impetus for his only full-length portrait, the elegant ''Portrait of Louis-Auguste Schwiter'' (1826\u201330). At roughly the same time, Delacroix was creating romantic works of numerous themes, many of which would continue to interest him for over thirty years. By 1825, he was producing lithographs illustrating Shakespeare, and soon thereafter lithographs and paintings from [[Goethe's Faust]]. Paintings such as ''The Combat of the Giaour and Hassan'' (1826), and ''Woman with Parrot'' (1827), introduced subjects of violence and sensuality which would prove to be recurrent.<ref>Jobert, page 98.</ref>\n\nThese various romantic strands came together in ''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'' (1827\u201328). Delacroix's painting of the death of the Assyrian king [[Sardanapalus]] shows an emotionally stirring scene alive with beautiful colours, exotic costumes and tragic events. The ''Death of Sardanapalus'' depicts the besieged king watching impassively as guards carry out his orders to kill his servants, concubines and animals. The literary source is [[Sardanapalus (play)|a play]] by Byron, although the play does not specifically mention any massacre of concubines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artble.com/artists/eugene_delacroix/paintings/the_death_of_sardanapalus|title='The Death of Sardanapalus' \u2013 Analysis and Critical Reception|publisher=www.artble.com|accessdate=27 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nSardanapalus' attitude of calm detachment is a familiar pose in [[Romanticism|Romantic]] imagery in this period in Europe. The painting, which was not exhibited again for many years afterward, has been regarded by some critics{{who|date=April 2018}} as a gruesome fantasy involving death and lust. Especially shocking is the struggle of a nude woman whose throat is about to be cut, a scene placed prominently in the foreground for maximum impact. However, the sensuous beauty and exotic colours of the composition make the picture appear pleasing and shocking at the same time.{{original research inline|date=April 2018}}\n\nA variety of Romantic interests were again synthesized in ''The Murder of the Bishop of Li\u00e8ge'' (1829). It also borrowed from a literary source, this time Scott, and depicts a scene from the [[Middle Ages]], that of the murder of [[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge]] amidst an orgy sponsored by his captor, [[William de la Marck]]. Set in an immense vaulted interior which Delacroix based on sketches of the Palais de Justice in [[Rouen]] and [[Westminster Hall]], the drama plays out in chiaroscuro, organized around a brilliantly lit stretch of tablecloth. In 1855, a critic described the painting's vibrant handling as \"Less finished than a painting, more finished than a sketch, ''The Murder of the Bishop of Li\u00e8ge'' was left by the painter at that supreme moment when one more stroke of the brush would have ruined everything\".<ref>Jobert, pages 116\u201318.</ref>\n\n===''Liberty Leading the People''===\n{{main|Liberty Leading the People}}\n[[Image:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830), [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]]]\nDelacroix's most influential work came in 1830 with the painting ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'', which for choice of subject and technique highlights the differences between the romantic approach and the neoclassical style. Less obviously, it also differs from the Romanticism of [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault|G\u00e9ricault]], as exemplified by ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]''.\n\n<blockquote>Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions...<ref name=\"wellington_xv\">Wellington, page xv.</ref></blockquote>\n\nProbably Delacroix's best-known painting, ''Liberty Leading the People'' is an unforgettable image of Parisians, having taken up arms, marching forward under the banner of the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] representing liberty, equality, and fraternity. Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty, he seems to be trying to convey the will and character of the people,<ref name=\"wellington_xv\" /> rather than glorifying the actual event, [[July Revolution|the 1830 revolution]] against [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], which did little other than bring a different king, [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], to power. The warriors lying dead in the foreground offer poignant counterpoint to the symbolic female figure, who is illuminated triumphantly, as if in a spotlight.{{original research inline|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - Christ on the Sea of Galilee - Google Art Project (27796212).jpg|thumbnail|''Christ on the [[Sea of Galilee]]'', 1854 ]]\n\nAlthough the French government bought the painting, officials deemed its glorification of liberty too inflammatory and removed it from public view.

He went not primarily to study art, but to escape from the civilization of Paris, in hopes of seeing a more primitive culture.<ref name=\"wellington_xv\" /> He eventually produced over 100 paintings and drawings of scenes from or based on the life of the people of North Africa, and added a new and personal chapter to the interest in [[Orientalism]].<ref>Jobert, page 140.</ref> Delacroix was entranced by the people and the costumes, and the trip would inform the subject matter of a great many of his future paintings. He believed that the North Africans, in their attire and their attitudes, provided a visual equivalent to the people of Classical Rome and Greece:\n\n<blockquote>The Greeks and Romans are here at my door, in the Arabs who wrap themselves in a white blanket and look like Cato or Brutus...<ref name=\"wellington_xv\" /></blockquote>\n[[Image:Eugene delacroix.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Self-portrait]]'', 1837. \"Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix was a curious mixture of skepticism, politeness, dandyism, willpower, cleverness, despotism, and finally, a kind of special goodness and tenderness that always accompanies genius\".<ref>Baudelaire, quoted in Jobert, page 27.</ref>]]\nHe managed to sketch some women secretly in [[Algiers]], as in the painting ''[[Women of Algiers in their Apartment]]'' (1834), but generally he encountered difficulty in finding Muslim women to pose for him because of Muslim rules requiring that women be covered.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Less problematic was the painting of [[Jewish]] women in North Africa, as subjects for the ''Jewish Wedding in Morocco'' (1837\u20131841).\n\nWhile in [[Tangier]], Delacroix made many sketches of the people and the city, subjects to which he would return until the end of his life.<ref>Wellington, page xvi.</ref> Animals\u2014the embodiment of romantic passion\u2014were incorporated into paintings such as ''[[Arab Horses Fighting in a Stable]]'' (1860), ''The Lion Hunt'' (of which there exist many versions, painted between 1856 and 1861), and ''Arab Saddling his Horse'' (1855).\n\n==Musical Inspirations==\n[[File:Lille PdBA delacroix medee.JPG|right|thumb|''Medea about to Kill Her Children'', 1838]]\n\n[[File:Delacroix barque of dante 1822 louvre 189cmx246cm 950px.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822), [[Louvre]]]]\n\nDelacroix drew inspiration from many sources over his career, such as the literary works of William Shakespeare and Lord Byron, or the artistry of Michelangelo. But from beginning to end of his life, he was in part characterized by a constant need for music, saying in 1855, \"nothing can be compared with the emotion caused by music; that it expresses incomparable shades of feeling.\" He had said, while working at Saint Sulpice, that the music put him in a state of \"exaltation\" which inspired his painting. It was often in music, in the most melancholy renditions of Chopin, or the \"pastoral\" works of Beethoven that Delacroix was often able to draw the most emotion and inspiration. At one point during his life, Delacroix befriended and made portraits of the composer Chopin; in his journal, Delacroix praised him frequently.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jean-Aubry |first=G. |date=1920 |title=A Music-Lover of the Past: Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix |jstor=737975 |journal=The Musical Quarterly |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=478\u2013499 |doi=10.1093/mq/vi.4.478}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Delacroix lion hunt 1855.JPG|thumb|''Lion Hunt'' (1855), [[Nationalmuseum]], Stockholm]]\n[[File:CLC9104.jpg|thumb|''Lion Hunt'' (1860/61), [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]\n\n==Murals and later life==\nIn 1838 Delacroix exhibited ''Medea about to Kill Her Children'', which created a sensation at the Salon. His first large-scale treatment of a scene from Greek mythology, the painting depicts [[Medea]] clutching her children, dagger drawn to slay them in vengeance for her abandonment by [[Jason]]. The three nude figures form an animated pyramid, bathed in a raking light which penetrates the grotto in which Medea has hidden. Though the painting was quickly purchased by the State, Delacroix was disappointed when it was sent to the [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lille|Lille Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts]]; he had intended for it to hang at the Luxembourg, where it would have joined ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' and ''[[Scenes from the Massacres of Chios]]''.<ref>Jobert, pages 245\u20136.</ref>\n\nFrom 1833 Delacroix received numerous commissions to decorate public buildings in Paris. In that year he began work for the Salon du Roi in the Chambre des D\u00e9put\u00e9s, [[Palais Bourbon]], which was not completed until 1837, and began a lifelong friendship with the female artist [[Madame Cav\u00e9|Marie-\u00c9lisabeth Blavot-Boulanger]]. For the next ten years he painted in both the Library at the Palais Bourbon and the Library at the Palais du Luxembourg. In 1843 he decorated the Church of St. Denis du Saint Sacrement with a large ''Piet\u00e0'', and from 1848 to 1850 he painted the ceiling in the [[Galerie d'Apollon]] of the [[Louvre]]. From 1857 to 1861 he worked on frescoes for the Chapelle des Anges at the [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Church of St. Sulpice]] in Paris. They included \"The Battle of Jacob with the Angel\", \"Saint Michael Slaying the Dragon\", and \"The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spector|first1=Jack J.|title=The Murals of Eugene Delacroix at Saint-Sulpice|date=1985|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press}}</ref> These commissions offered him the opportunity to compose on a large scale in an architectural setting, much as had those masters he admired, [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Tintoretto]], and Rubens.\n\nThe work was fatiguing, and during these years he suffered from an increasingly fragile constitution. In addition to his home in Paris, from 1844 he also lived at a small cottage in [[Champrosay]], where he found respite in the countryside. From 1834 until his death, he was faithfully cared for by his housekeeper, Jeanne-Marie le Guillou, who zealously guarded his privacy, and whose devotion prolonged his life and his ability to continue working in his later years.<ref>Wellington, pages xxvii\u2013xxviii.</ref>\n\nIn 1862 Delacroix participated in the creation of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts]]. His friend, the writer [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]], became chairman, with the painter [[Aim\u00e9 Millet]] acting as deputy chairman. In addition to Delacroix, the committee was composed of the painters [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse|Carrier-Belleuse]] and [[Puvis de Chavannes]]. Among the exhibitors were L\u00e9on Bonnat, [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]], [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny]], [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], and [[\u00c9douard Manet]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Just after his death in 1863, the society organized a retrospective exhibition of 248 paintings and lithographs by Delacroix\u2014and ceased to mount any further exhibitions.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe winter of 1862\u201363 was extremely rough for Delacroix; he was suffering from a bad throat infection which seemed to get worse over the course of the season. On a trip to Champrosay, he met a friend on the train and became exhausted after having a conversation. On 1 June he returned to Paris to see his doctor. Two weeks later, on 16 June, he was getting better and returned to his house in the country. But by 15 July he was sick enough to see his doctor who said he could do nothing more for him. By then, the only food he could eat was fruit. Delacroix realized the seriousness of his condition and wrote his will, leaving a gift for each of his friends. For his trusted housekeeper, Jenny Le Guillou, he left enough money for her to live on while ordering everything in his studio to be sold. He also inserted a clause forbidding any representation of his features, \"whether by a death-mask or by drawing or by photography. I forbid it, expressly.\"<ref name=\"Deslandres\">{{cite book |last=Deslandres |first=Yvonne |author-link=Yvonne Deslandres |translator-last=Griffin |translator-first=Jonathan |year=1963 |title=Delacroix: A pictorial biography |url=https://archive.org/details/delacroixpictori00desl |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Viking Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/delacroixpictori00desl/page/126 126] |oclc=518099 |quote=He passed anxiously through the winter of 1862\u201363: the bad season was always dangerous to his vulnerable throat.

A fine [[lithography|lithograph]]er, Delacroix illustrated various works of [[William Shakespeare]], the Scottish author [[Walter Scott]] and the German author [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].\n\nIn contrast to the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] perfectionism of his chief rival [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and painters of the Venetian [[Renaissance]], with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic.<ref>Gombrich, E.H., ''The Story of Art'', pages 504\u20136.

The work caused a sensation, and was largely derided by the public and officialdom, yet was purchased by the State for the [[Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg|Luxembourg Galleries]]; the pattern of widespread opposition to his work, countered by a vigorous, enlightened support, would continue throughout his life.<ref name=\"wellington_xii\">Wellington, page xii.</ref> Two years later he again achieved popular success for his ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]''.\n\n==Career==\n===''Chios'' and ''Missolonghi''===\n[[Image:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|''[[The Massacre at Chios|Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824), [[Louvre]]]]\nDelacroix's painting of [[Chios Massacre|the massacre]] at [[Chios]] shows sick, dying Greek civilians about to be slaughtered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. One of several paintings he made of this contemporary event, expressed the official policy for the Greek cause in [[Greek War of Independence|their war of independence]] against the Turks, war sustained by English, Russian and French governments. Delacroix was quickly recognized by the authorities as a leading painter in the new Romantic style, and the picture was bought by the state. His depiction of suffering was controversial, however, as there was no glorious event taking place, no patriots raising their swords in valour as in [[Jacques-Louis David|David's]] ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', only a disaster. Many critics deplored the painting's despairing tone; the artist [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] called it \"a massacre of art\".<ref name=\"wellington_xii\" /> The pathos in the depiction of an infant clutching its dead mother's breast had an especially powerful effect, although this detail was condemned as unfit for art by Delacroix's critics. A viewing of the paintings of [[John Constable]] and the watercolour sketches and art of [[Richard Parkes Bonnington]] prompted Delacroix to make extensive, freely painted changes to the sky and distant landscape.<ref>Wellington, pages xii, 16.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 017.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi]]'' (1826), [[Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Bordeaux|Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts]], [[Bordeaux]]]]\n\nDelacroix produced a second painting in support of the Greeks in their war for independence, this time referring to the capture of [[Missolonghi]] by Turkish forces in 1825.<ref>Jobert, page 127.</ref> With a restraint of palette appropriate to the allegory, ''Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi'' displays a woman in Greek costume with her breast bared, arms half-raised in an imploring gesture before the horrible scene: the suicide of the Greeks, who chose to kill themselves and destroy their city rather than surrender to the Turks. A hand is seen at the bottom, the body having been crushed by rubble. The painting serves as a monument to the people of Missolonghi and to the idea of freedom against tyrannical rule. This event interested Delacroix not only for his sympathies with the Greeks, but also because the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], whom Delacroix greatly admired, had died there.<ref name=\"Noon58\" />\n\n===Romanticism===\n[[File:Ferdinand-Victor-Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, French - The Death of Sardanapalus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'' (1827), [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]\n[[File:Eugene Delacroix - Horse Frightened by Lightning - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Horse Frightened by a Storm'', watercolour, 1824]]\nA trip to England in 1825 included visits to [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Thomas Lawrence]] and [[Richard Parkes Bonington]], and the colour and handling of English painting provided impetus for his only full-length portrait, the elegant ''Portrait of Louis-Auguste Schwiter'' (1826\u201330). At roughly the same time, Delacroix was creating romantic works of numerous themes, many of which would continue to interest him for over thirty years. By 1825, he was producing lithographs illustrating Shakespeare, and soon thereafter lithographs and paintings from [[Goethe's Faust]]. Paintings such as ''The Combat of the Giaour and Hassan'' (1826), and ''Woman with Parrot'' (1827), introduced subjects of violence and sensuality which would prove to be recurrent.<ref>Jobert, page 98.</ref>\n\nThese various romantic strands came together in ''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'' (1827\u201328). Delacroix's painting of the death of the Assyrian king [[Sardanapalus]] shows an emotionally stirring scene alive with beautiful colours, exotic costumes and tragic events. The ''Death of Sardanapalus'' depicts the besieged king watching impassively as guards carry out his orders to kill his servants, concubines and animals. The literary source is [[Sardanapalus (play)|a play]] by Byron, although the play does not specifically mention any massacre of concubines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artble.com/artists/eugene_delacroix/paintings/the_death_of_sardanapalus|title='The Death of Sardanapalus' \u2013 Analysis and Critical Reception|publisher=www.artble.com|accessdate=27 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nSardanapalus' attitude of calm detachment is a familiar pose in [[Romanticism|Romantic]] imagery in this period in Europe. The painting, which was not exhibited again for many years afterward, has been regarded by some critics{{who|date=April 2018}} as a gruesome fantasy involving death and lust. Especially shocking is the struggle of a nude woman whose throat is about to be cut, a scene placed prominently in the foreground for maximum impact. However, the sensuous beauty and exotic colours of the composition make the picture appear pleasing and shocking at the same time.{{original research inline|date=April 2018}}\n\nA variety of Romantic interests were again synthesized in ''The Murder of the Bishop of Li\u00e8ge'' (1829). It also borrowed from a literary source, this time Scott, and depicts a scene from the [[Middle Ages]], that of the murder of [[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge]] amidst an orgy sponsored by his captor, [[William de la Marck]]. Set in an immense vaulted interior which Delacroix based on sketches of the Palais de Justice in [[Rouen]] and [[Westminster Hall]], the drama plays out in chiaroscuro, organized around a brilliantly lit stretch of tablecloth. In 1855, a critic described the painting's vibrant handling as \"Less finished than a painting, more finished than a sketch, ''The Murder of the Bishop of Li\u00e8ge'' was left by the painter at that supreme moment when one more stroke of the brush would have ruined everything\".<ref>Jobert, pages 116\u201318.</ref>\n\n===''Liberty Leading the People''===\n{{main|Liberty Leading the People}}\n[[Image:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830), [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]]]\nDelacroix's most influential work came in 1830 with the painting ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'', which for choice of subject and technique highlights the differences between the romantic approach and the neoclassical style. Less obviously, it also differs from the Romanticism of [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault|G\u00e9ricault]], as exemplified by ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]''.\n\n<blockquote>Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions...<ref name=\"wellington_xv\">Wellington, page xv.</ref></blockquote>\n\nProbably Delacroix's best-known painting, ''Liberty Leading the People'' is an unforgettable image of Parisians, having taken up arms, marching forward under the banner of the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] representing liberty, equality, and fraternity. Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty, he seems to be trying to convey the will and character of the people,<ref name=\"wellington_xv\" /> rather than glorifying the actual event, [[July Revolution|the 1830 revolution]] against [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], which did little other than bring a different king, [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], to power.

He went not primarily to study art, but to escape from the civilization of Paris, in hopes of seeing a more primitive culture.<ref name=\"wellington_xv\" /> He eventually produced over 100 paintings and drawings of scenes from or based on the life of the people of North Africa, and added a new and personal chapter to the interest in [[Orientalism]].<ref>Jobert, page 140.</ref> Delacroix was entranced by the people and the costumes, and the trip would inform the subject matter of a great many of his future paintings.

But from beginning to end of his life, he was in part characterized by a constant need for music, saying in 1855, \"nothing can be compared with the emotion caused by music; that it expresses incomparable shades of feeling.\" He had said, while working at Saint Sulpice, that the music put him in a state of \"exaltation\" which inspired his painting. It was often in music, in the most melancholy renditions of Chopin, or the \"pastoral\" works of Beethoven that Delacroix was often able to draw the most emotion and inspiration. At one point during his life, Delacroix befriended and made portraits of the composer Chopin; in his journal, Delacroix praised him frequently.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jean-Aubry |first=G. |date=1920 |title=A Music-Lover of the Past: Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix |jstor=737975 |journal=The Musical Quarterly |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=478\u2013499 |doi=10.1093/mq/vi.4.478}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Delacroix lion hunt 1855.JPG|thumb|''Lion Hunt'' (1855), [[Nationalmuseum]], Stockholm]]\n[[File:CLC9104.jpg|thumb|''Lion Hunt'' (1860/61), [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]\n\n==Murals and later life==\nIn 1838 Delacroix exhibited ''Medea about to Kill Her Children'', which created a sensation at the Salon. His first large-scale treatment of a scene from Greek mythology, the painting depicts [[Medea]] clutching her children, dagger drawn to slay them in vengeance for her abandonment by [[Jason]]. The three nude figures form an animated pyramid, bathed in a raking light which penetrates the grotto in which Medea has hidden. Though the painting was quickly purchased by the State, Delacroix was disappointed when it was sent to the [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lille|Lille Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts]]; he had intended for it to hang at the Luxembourg, where it would have joined ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' and ''[[Scenes from the Massacres of Chios]]''.<ref>Jobert, pages 245\u20136.</ref>\n\nFrom 1833 Delacroix received numerous commissions to decorate public buildings in Paris. In that year he began work for the Salon du Roi in the Chambre des D\u00e9put\u00e9s, [[Palais Bourbon]], which was not completed until 1837, and began a lifelong friendship with the female artist [[Madame Cav\u00e9|Marie-\u00c9lisabeth Blavot-Boulanger]]. For the next ten years he painted in both the Library at the Palais Bourbon and the Library at the Palais du Luxembourg. In 1843 he decorated the Church of St. Denis du Saint Sacrement with a large ''Piet\u00e0'', and from 1848 to 1850 he painted the ceiling in the [[Galerie d'Apollon]] of the [[Louvre]]. From 1857 to 1861 he worked on frescoes for the Chapelle des Anges at the [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Church of St. Sulpice]] in Paris. They included \"The Battle of Jacob with the Angel\", \"Saint Michael Slaying the Dragon\", and \"The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spector|first1=Jack J.|title=The Murals of Eugene Delacroix at Saint-Sulpice|date=1985|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press}}</ref> These commissions offered him the opportunity to compose on a large scale in an architectural setting, much as had those masters he admired, [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Tintoretto]], and Rubens.\n\nThe work was fatiguing, and during these years he suffered from an increasingly fragile constitution. In addition to his home in Paris, from 1844 he also lived at a small cottage in [[Champrosay]], where he found respite in the countryside. From 1834 until his death, he was faithfully cared for by his housekeeper, Jeanne-Marie le Guillou, who zealously guarded his privacy, and whose devotion prolonged his life and his ability to continue working in his later years.<ref>Wellington, pages xxvii\u2013xxviii.</ref>\n\nIn 1862 Delacroix participated in the creation of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts]].

Two weeks later, on 16 June, he was getting better and returned to his house in the country. But by 15 July he was sick enough to see his doctor who said he could do nothing more for him.

O&Ms are considered one of the major barriers for further development of this resource.\n\nMaintenance of offshore wind farms is much more expensive than for onshore installations.\nFor example, a single technician in a pickup truck can quickly, easily and safely access turbines on land in almost any weather conditions, exit his or her vehicle and simply walk over to and into the turbine tower to gain access to the entire unit within minutes of arriving onsite. \nSimilar access to offshore turbines involves driving to a dock or pier, loading necessary tools and supplies into boat, a voyage to the wind turbine(s), securing the boat to the turbine structure, transferring tools and supplies to and from boat to turbine and turbine to boat and performing the rest of the steps in reverse order. \nIn addition to standard safety gear such as a hardhat, gloves and safety glasses, an offshore turbine technician may be required to wear a life vest, waterproof or water-resistant clothing and perhaps even a survival suit if working, sea and atmospheric conditions make rapid rescue in case of a fall into the water unlikely or impossible.\nTypically at least two technicians skilled and

With one of the main reasons for interest in offshore wind power being the higher wind speeds, some of the loading differences will come from higher shearing forces between the top and bottom of the wind turbine due to differences in wind speeds.

First, HVAC is limited by cable charging currents,<ref name=\"second\"/> which are a result of capacitance in the cables. Undersea AC cables have a much higher capacitance than overhead AC cables, so losses due to capacitance become much more significant, and the voltage magnitude at the receiving end of the transmission line can be significantly different from the magnitude at the receiving end. In order to compensate for these losses, either more cables or reactive compensation must be added to the system. Both of these add costs to the system.<ref name=\"second\"/> Additionally, because HVAC cables have both [[AC power#Active, reactive, and apparent power|real and reactive power]] flowing through them, there can be additional losses.<ref name=\"third\">{{cite book |last1=Anaya-Lara |first1=Olimpo |last2=Campos-Gaona |first2=David |last3=Moreno-Goytia |first3=Edgar |last4=Adam |first4=Grain |title=Grid Integration of Offshore Wind Farms \u2013 Case Studies |date=10 April 2014 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=9781118701638 |doi=10.1002/9781118701638.ch5 }}</ref> Because of these losses, underground HVAC lines are limited in how far they can extend.

They would enable better planning just-in-time maintenance, thereby reducing the operations and maintenance costs. According to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government (supported by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]]),<ref name=zehn/> making field data from these turbines available would be invaluable in validating complex analysis codes used for turbine design. Reducing this barrier would contribute to the education of engineers specializing in wind energy.\n\n==Decommissioning==\nAs the first offshore wind farms reach their end of life, a demolition industry develops to recycle them at a cost of DKK 2-4 million per MW, to be guaranteed by the owner.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://ing.dk/artikel/aldrende-havmolleparker-abner-marked-klog-nedrivning-182308 |title=Aldrende havm\u00f8lleparker \u00e5bner marked for klog nedrivning|work=Ingeni\u00f8ren|accessdate=20 May 2016|date=2016-02-20}}</ref>\nThe first offshore wind farm to be decommissioned was [[Yttre Stengrund offshore wind farm|Yttre Stengrund]] in Sweden in November 2015, followed by [[Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm|Vindeby]] in 2017 and [[Blyth Offshore Wind Farm|Blyth]] in 2019.\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{Main|Environmental impact of wind power}}\nOffshore wind farms have very low [[global warming potential]] per unit of electricity generated, comparable to that of onshore wind farms.

O&Ms are considered one of the major barriers for further development of this resource.\n\nMaintenance of offshore wind farms is much more expensive than for onshore installations.\nFor example, a single technician in a pickup truck can quickly, easily and safely access turbines on land in almost any weather conditions, exit his or her vehicle and simply walk over to and into the turbine tower to gain access to the entire unit within minutes of arriving onsite. \nSimilar access to offshore turbines involves driving to a dock or pier, loading necessary tools and supplies into boat, a voyage to the wind turbine(s), securing the boat to the turbine structure, transferring tools and supplies to and from boat to turbine and turbine to boat and performing the rest of the steps in reverse order. \nIn addition to standard safety gear such as a hardhat, gloves and safety glasses, an offshore turbine technician may be required to wear a life vest, waterproof or water-resistant clothing and perhaps even a survival suit if working, sea and atmospheric conditions make rapid rescue in case of a fall into the water unlikely or impossible.\nTypically at least two technicians skilled and trained in operating and handling large power boats at sea are required for tasks that one technician with a driver's license can perform on land in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost.\n\n===Cost of energy===\nCost for installed offshore turbines fell 30% to $78/MWh in 2019, a more rapid drop than other types of renewable energy.<ref name=bnef2019/>\nIt has been suggested that

With one of the main reasons for interest in offshore wind power being the higher wind speeds, some of the loading differences will come from higher shearing forces between the top and bottom of the wind turbine due to differences in wind speeds. There should also be considerations for the buffeting loads that will be experienced by the waves around the base of the tower, which converges on the use of steel tubular towers for offshore wind applications.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Chong|first=Ng|title=Offshore wind farms : technologies, design and operation|date=2016-03-03|publisher=Elsevier, WP Woodhead Publishing|others=Ng, Chong,, Ran, Li|year=2016|isbn=978-0-08-100780-8|location=Duxford, UK|pages=|oclc=944186047}}</ref>\n\nSince there\u2019s constant exposure to salt and water for offshore wind turbines, the steel used for the monopile and turbine tower must be treated for corrosion resistance, especially at the base of the tower in the \u201csplash zone\u201d for waves breaking against the tower and in the monopile.

These piles can be 4&nbsp;m in diameter with approximately 50mm thick walls. \nA transition piece (complete with pre-installed features such as boat-landing arrangement, [[cathodic protection]], cable ducts for sub-marine cables, turbine tower flange, etc.) is attached to the now deeply driven pile, the sand and water are removed from the centre of the pile and replaced with [[concrete]]. An additional layer of even larger stone, up to 0.5&nbsp;m diameter, is applied to the surface of the seabed for longer-term erosion protection.<ref name=hre20100412/>\n\nFor the ease of installing the towers and connecting them to the seabed, they are installed in two parts, the portion below the water surface and the portion above the water.<ref name=\":0\" /> The two portions of the tower are joined by a transition piece which is filled with a grouted connection. The grouted connected helps transfer the loads experienced by the turbine tower to the more stable monopile foundation of the turbine. One technique for strengthening the grout used in the connections is to include weld beads known as shear keys along the length of the grout connection to prevent any sliding between the monopile and the tower.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tziavos|first=Nikolaos I.|last2=Hemida|first2=Hassan|last3=Metje|first3=Nicole|last4=Baniotopoulos|first4=Charalampos|date=2016-06-08|title=Grouted connections on offshore wind turbines: a review|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Engineering and Computational Mechanics|volume=169|issue=4|pages=183\u2013195|doi=10.1680/jencm.16.00004|issn=1755-0777|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/27996593/Tziavos_et_al_Grouted_connections_Proceedings_ICE_Accepted.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Grid connection==\n[[File:Dolwin Beta (14823021740).jpg|thumb|An offshore structure for housing an [[HVDC converter station]] for offshore wind parks is being moved by a [[heavy-lift ship]] in Norway.]]\nThere are several different types of technologies that are being explored as viable options for integrating offshore wind power into the onshore grid. The most conventional method is through high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) transmission lines. HVAC transmission lines are currently the most commonly used form of grid connections for offshore wind turbines.<ref name=\"second\">{{cite web |last1=Daniel |first1=John |last2=Liu |first2=Shu |last3=Ibanez |first3=Eduardo |last4=Pennock |first4=Ken |last5=Reed |first5=Gregory |last6=Hanes |first6=Spencer |title=National Offshore Wind Energy Grid Interconnection Study Executive Summary |url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/08/f18/NOWEGIS%20Executive%20Summary.pdf |accessdate=1 May 2019}}</ref> However, there are significant limitations that prevent HVAC from being practical, especially as the distance to offshore turbines increases. First, HVAC is limited by cable charging currents,<ref name=\"second\"/> which are a result of capacitance in the cables. Undersea AC cables have a much higher capacitance than overhead AC cables, so losses due to capacitance become much more significant, and the voltage magnitude at the receiving end of the transmission line can be significantly different from the magnitude at the receiving end. In order to compensate for these losses, either more cables or reactive compensation must be added to the system. Both of these add costs to the system.<ref name=\"second\"/> Additionally, because HVAC cables have both [[AC power#Active, reactive, and apparent power|real and reactive power]] flowing through them, there can be additional losses.<ref name=\"third\">{{cite book |last1=Anaya-Lara |first1=Olimpo |last2=Campos-Gaona |first2=David |last3=Moreno-Goytia |first3=Edgar |last4=Adam |first4=Grain |title=Grid Integration of Offshore Wind Farms \u2013 Case Studies |date=10 April 2014 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=9781118701638 |doi=10.1002/9781118701638.ch5 }}</ref> Because of these losses, underground HVAC lines are limited in how far they can extend. The maximum appropriate distance for HVAC transmission for offshore wind power is considered to be around 80&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"second\"/>\n\nUsing high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cables has been a proposed alternative to using HVAC cables. HVDC transmission cables are not affected by the cable charging currents and experience less power loss because HVDC does not transmit reactive power.<ref name=\"first\">{{cite journal |last1=Torres-Olguin |first1=Raymundo |last2=Molinas |first2=Marta |last3=Undeland |first3=Tore |title=Offshore Wind Farm Grid Integration by VSC Technology With LCC-Based HVDC Transmission |journal=IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy |date=October 2012 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=899 |bibcode=2012ITSE....3..899T |doi=10.1109/TSTE.2012.2200511 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af131da3f013047e518a48ef55569f63c272872f }}</ref> With less losses, undersea HVDC lines can extend much farther than HVAC.

Both [[HVDC converter#Line-commutated converters|line commutated converters (LCCs)]] and [[HVDC converter#Voltage-source converters|voltage source converters (VSCs)]] have been considered for this. Although LCCs are a much more widespread technology and cheaper, VSCs have many more benefits, including independent active power and reactive power control.<ref name=\"first\"/> New research has been put into developing hybrid HVDC technologies that have a LCC connected to a VSC through a DC cable.<ref name=\"first\"/>\n\nIn order to transport the energy from offshore wind turbines to onshore energy plants, cabling has to be placed along the ocean floor.

The Edge TPU is Google's purpose-built [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] chip designed to run machine learning (ML) models for [[edge computing]], meaning it is much smaller and consumes far less power compared to the TPUs hosted in Google datacenters (also known as [https://cloud.google.com/tpu/ Cloud TPUs]). In January 2019, Google made the Edge TPU available to developers with a line of products under the [[Coral (AI)|Coral]] brand. The Edge TPU is capable of 4 TOPs while using 2W.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coral.ai/docs/edgetpu/benchmarks/|title=Edge TPU performance benchmarks|website=Coral|language=en-us|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThe product offerings include a [[single board computer]] (SBC), a [[system on module]] (SoM), a [[USB|USB]] accessory, a mini [[PCI-e]] card, and an [[M.2]] card. The [[Single Board Computer|SBC]] [https://coral.withgoogle.com/products/dev-board Coral Dev Board] and [https://coral.withgoogle.com/products/som Coral SoM] both run Mendel Linux OS \u2013 a derivative of [[Debian]]. The USB, PCI-e, and M.2 products function as add-ons to existing computer systems, and support Debian-based Linux systems on x86-64 and ARM64 hosts (including [[Raspberry Pi]]).\n\nThe machine learning runtime used to execute models on the Edge TPU is based on [[TensorFlow|TensorFlow Lite]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blog.google/products/google-cloud/bringing-intelligence-to-the-edge-with-cloud-iot/|title=Bringing intelligence to the edge with Cloud IoT|date=2018-07-25|website=Google Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref> The Edge TPU is only capable of accelerating forward-pass operations, which means it's primarily useful for performing inferences (although it is possible to perform lightweight transfer learning on the Edge TPU<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coral.withgoogle.com/docs/edgetpu/retrain-classification-ondevice/|title=Retrain an image classification model on-device|access-date=2019-05-03|website=Coral}}</ref>). The Edge TPU also only supports 8-bit math, meaning that for a network to be compatible with the Edge TPU, it needs to be trained using TensorFlow [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.13/tensorflow/contrib/quantize quantization-aware training] technique.\n\nOn November 12, 2019, [[Asus]] announced a pair of [[Single-board computer|single-board computer (SBCs)]] featuring the Edge TPU.
