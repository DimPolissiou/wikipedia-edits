Against the wishes of her mother ([[Neena Kulkarni]]) and brother, Mira gets married to Akash. Akash and Mira start a life full of love. Once Rahul ([[Yash Pathak]]) is born Mira's family forgives them. Akash has his own small business of travel. He is dedicated to working but would not earn money by cheating. On Rahul's first birthday Akash gives Mira the permission of inviting her family. At the venue, Mira's family comes along and Mira's brother ([[Manish Wadhwa]]) insults Akash to the core. This infuriates Akash and he hits Mira's brother. Mira asks Akash to apologise to her brother, which the former refuses. Mira's family forcibly takes her away from Akash. She is also forced to leave behind her son Rahul. Akash and Mira get divorced in the court and fearing that Akash might take her life in absence of Rahul, Mira is forced to give the custody of her only child to Akash, until he is at least five years old.\n\nRahul who had been so long living with his father misses his mother very much. His father has infiltrated the idea in him that his mother is very bad. However, he finds out from Uncle John ([[Gulshan Grover]]) that Mira is very good and that she lives in [[Mahabaleshwar]] with her parents. Rahul secretly goes and meets her, after which he finds out that his mother is very loving and caring towards him. Rahul and Mira continue to meet each other secretly. Meanwhile, Rahul falls ill quite often, which leads others including the family doctor to suggest that Akash goes for a second marriage with Sheila ([[Rajeshwari Sachdev]]). Sheila cares for Rahul too. Akash initially refuses but eventually agrees for the sake of Rahul. Rahul likes Sheila but cannot take her to be his mother. Mira comes to know the fact that Akash is getting ready for a second marriage. Mira's family also wants her to marry Naveen ([[Mahesh Thakur]]).\n\nOne day Akash finds out that Mira and Rahul are in touch. He forces the kid to tell Mira that he hates her.

Against the wishes of her mother ([[Neena Kulkarni]]) and brother, Mira gets married to Akash. Akash and Mira start a life full of love. Once Rahul ([[Yash Pathak]]) is born Mira's family forgives them. Akash has his own small business of travel. He is dedicated to working but would not earn money by cheating. On Rahul's first birthday Akash gives Mira the permission of inviting her family. At the venue, Mira's family comes along and Mira's brother ([[Manish Wadhwa]]) insults Akash to the core. This infuriates Akash and he hits Mira's brother. Mira asks Akash to apologise to her brother, which the former refuses. Mira's family forcibly takes her away from Akash. She is also forced to leave behind her son Rahul. Akash and Mira get divorced in the court and fearing that Akash might take her life in absence of Rahul, Mira is forced to give the custody of her only child to Akash, until he is at least 5 years old.\n\nRahul who had been so long living with his father misses his mother very much. His father has infiltrated the idea in him that his mother is very bad. However, he finds out from Uncle John ([[Gulshan Grover]]) that Mira is very good and that she lives in [[Mahabaleshwar]] with her parents. Rahul secretly goes and meets her, after which he finds out that his mother is very loving and caring towards him. Rahul and Mira continue to meet each other secretly. Meanwhile, Rahul falls ill quite often, which leads others including the family doctor to suggest that Akash goes for a second marriage with Sheila ([[Rajeshwari Sachdev]]). Sheila cares for Rahul too. Akash initially refuses but eventually agrees for the sake of Rahul. Rahul likes Sheila but cannot take her to be his mother. Mira comes to know the fact that Akash is getting ready for a second marriage. Mira's family also wants her to get married to Naveen ([[Mahesh Thakur]]).\n\nOne day Akash finds out that Mira and Rahul are in touch. He forces the kid to tell Mira that he hates her. This creates a tremendous pressure on Rahul's mind who gets drenched in rain and falls sick. This leads Akash and Mira to come to the hospital and confront each other. Mira then realizes that her family had been selfish all along and that Akash was not at fault. After Rahul is treated, the two get united for the sake of Rahul.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yash Pathak]] as Rahul Sharma \n* [[Jatin Grewal]] as Akash Sharma \n* [[Neha (actress)|Neha Bajpai]] as Mira Singh \n* [[Rajeshwari Sachdev]] as Sheila Singh as Rahul Teacher  \n* [[Mahesh Thakur]] as Naveen Malhotra\n* [[Gulshan Grover]] as Uncle John \n* [[Parikshat Sahni]] as Doctor Uncle \n* [[Manish Wadhwa]] as Rohit\n* [[Neena Kulkarni]] as Mrs. Singh \n* [[Isha Koppikar]] as Special Appearance in item number\n* Tanvi Hegde as Isha\n* [[Rita Joshi]]\n* [[Sudhir Mishra]]\n* [[Vrajesh Hirjee]] as Isha's father\n* Anil Nagrath\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music is composed by [[Anu Malik]] while the lyrics are penned by [[Anand Bakshi]].\n\n===Track listing===\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Singer(s)\n| title1 = A Song To Sing\n| extra1 = [[Maria Goretti (actress)|Maria Goretti]]\n| lyrics1 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length1 =\n| title2 = Chalti Hai Purvai\n| extra2 = [[Alka Yagnik]], [[Mahalakshmi Iyer]]\n| lyrics2 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length2 =\n| title3 = Ched Na Mujhko\n| extra3 = [[Hariharan (singer)|Hariharan]], [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]]\n| lyrics3 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length3 =\n| title4 =  Eh Kaash Aisa Hota\n| extra4 = [[Ustad Sultan Khan]]\n| lyrics4 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length4 =\n| title5 = Kaise Bhool Jaati Hai\n| extra5 = Sonali Bajpai\n| lyrics5 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length5 =\n| title6 = Piya Ki Jogan\n| extra6 = [[Sunidhi Chauhan]], [[Richa Sharma (singer)|Richa Sharma]]\n| lyrics6 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length6 =\n| title7 = Tu Mujhe Kaise Bhool Jaata Hai\n| extra7 = [[Alka Yagnik]]\n| lyrics7 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length7 =\n| title8 =  Vah Re Vah\n| extra8 = [[Roop Kumar Rathod]], Deepali Somaiya\n| lyrics8 = [[Anand Bakshi]]\n| length8 =\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|tt0277981|Rahul}}\n{{Subhash Ghai}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rahul (Film)}}\n[[Category:2000s Hindi-language films]]\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Prakash Jha]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:Indian drama films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Anu Malik]]\n[[Category:Films featuring an item number]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_(film)"}

He also procured the passage of the legislation \u2013 the [[Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003]] \u2013 which abolished the [[Rail Regulator]] and replaced him with the [[Office of Rail Regulation]]. He was responsible for the [[Railways Act 2005]] which abolished the [[Strategic Rail Authority]], a creation of the Labour government under the [[Transport Act 2000]]. Darling was also responsible for the cancellation of several major [[Light rail|Light Rail]] schemes, including a major extension to [[Manchester Metrolink]]<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3910235.stm |title=Government scraps trams extension |date=20 July 2004 |work=BBC News |accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> (later reversed) and the proposed [[Leeds Supertram]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4403788.stm |title=Tram refusal a slap in the face |date=3 November 2005 |work=BBC News |accessdate=29 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224173220/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4403788.stm |archive-date=24 December 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> citing rising costs of \u00a3620m and \u00a3486m respectively. \nDarling gave the government's support to the [[Crossrail]] scheme for an East-West rail line under London,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3910091.stm |title=Government backs 10bn Crossrail |date=20 July 2004 |work=BBC News |accessdate=29 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902234428/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3910091.stm |archive-date=2 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> whose \u00a310,000,000,000 projected cost later rose to \u00a315,000,000,000.\n\nAlthough he was not at the Department for Transport at the time of the collapse of Railtrack, Darling vigorously defended what had been done in a speech to the House of Commons on 24 October 2005. This included threats that had been made to the independent Rail Regulator that if he intervened to defend the company against the government's attempts to force it into railway administration \u2013 a special status for insolvent railway companies \u2013 the government would introduce emergency legislation to take the regulator under direct political control. This stance by Darling surprised many observers, because during his tenure at the Department for Transport, he had made several statements to Parliament and the financial markets assuring them that the government regarded independence in economic regulation of the railways as essential.\n\n===Secretary of State for Scotland===\nIn 2003, when the [[Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland|Scotland Office]] was folded into the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]], he was appointed [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Scottish Secretary]] in combination with his Transport portfolio.\n\n===Secretary of State for Trade and Industry===\nIn the [[Cabinet reshuffle]] of May 2006, he was moved to be [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]; [[Douglas Alexander]] replaced him as both [[Secretary of State for Transport]] and [[Secretary |Secretary of State for Scotland]].

It began seven years after the failure of the [[Fifth Crusade]] and involved very little actual fighting. The diplomatic maneuvering of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[King of Sicily]], [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], resulted in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] regaining some control over Jerusalem for much of the ensuing fifteen years (1229\u20131239, 1241\u20131244)<ref name=\"Boas\" /> as well as over other areas of the Holy Land.\n\n==Frederick II and the Papacy==\n[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], had involved himself broadly in the [[Fifth Crusade]], sending troops from Germany, but he failed to accompany the army directly, despite the encouragement of [[Honorius III]] and later [[Gregory IX]], as he needed to consolidate his position in Germany and Italy before embarking on a [[crusade]]. However, Frederick again :)promised to go on a crusade after his coronation as emperor in 1220 by [[Pope Honorius III]].\n\nIn 1225 Frederick married [[Isabella II of Jerusalem]] (also known as Yolande), daughter of [[John of Brienne]] (nominal ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]) and [[Maria of Montferrat]]. Frederick now had a claim to the truncated kingdom, and reason to attempt to restore it.<ref name=\"war_religion\" /> In 1227, after [[Pope Gregory IX|Gregory IX]] became [[pope]], Frederick's army set sail from [[Brindisi]] for [[Akko|Acre]] (then the capital of the truncated Kingdom of Jerusalem), but an epidemic forced Frederick to return to [[Italy]]. Gregory took this opportunity to [[excommunication|excommunicate]] Frederick for breaking his crusader vow, though this was just an excuse, as Frederick had for years been trying to consolidate imperial power in Italy at the expense of the [[papacy]].\n\nIn June 1228 Frederick made his last effort to be reconcile with Gregory, sending Archbishop [[Albert I of K\u00e4fernburg|Albert of Magdeburg]] and two Sicilian justiciars to speak with the pope. It had no effect and the excommunicated Frederick sailed from [[Brindisi]] on 28 June. The fleet was under the command of Admiral [[Henry of Malta]] and the archbishops of [[Archbishop of Palermo|Palermo]], [[Archbishop of Reggio|Reggio]], [[Archbishop of Capua|Capua]] and [[Archbishop of Bari|Bari]] accompanied him. He had only a small force with him, since the main force had sailed in August 1227 and reinforcements in April 1228.<ref>Van Cleve 1972, p. 206.</ref>\n\n==The Crusade==\n[[File:Sixi\u00e8me croisade-es.svg|thumb|Map of Sixth Crusade]]\n\n===Stopover in Cyprus===\nThe route of Frederick's fleet can be traced day-by-day. On 29 June it stopped in [[Otranto]], whence it crossed the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the island of [[Othonoi]] on 30 June. It was in [[Corfu]] on 1 July, Porto Guiscardo in [[Cephalonia]] on 2 July, [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] on 4 July, Portocaglie near [[Cape Matapan]] on 5 July, [[Cerigo]] on 6 July and it reached [[Souda Bay]] on [[Crete]] on 7 July. The fleet moved slowly along the Cretan coast, pausing for a whole day at [[Heraklion]] before crossing the [[Aegean Sea]] to [[Rhodes]] during 12\u201315 July. They sailed along the [[Anatolia]]n coast to Phenika, where they stayed on 16\u201317 July replenishing their water supplies. The fleet then crossed the sea to Cyprus, arriving at [[Limassol]] on 21 July.<ref>Van Cleve 1972, p. 207.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] had been an imperial fief since the Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], Frederick's father, had accepted the homage of [[Aimery of Cyprus|Aimery of Lusignan]] and made him king on the eve of the [[German Crusade]] in 1196.<ref>Van Cleve 1972, p. 213.</ref> The emperor arrived with the clear intent of stamping his authority on the kingdom, but was treated cordially by the native barons until a dispute arose between him and the constable of Cyprus, [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin]]. Frederick claimed that his regency was illegitimate and demanded the surrender of John's mainland fief of [[Beirut]] to the imperial throne. Here he erred, for John pointed out that the kingdoms of Cyprus and Jerusalem were constitutionally separate and he could not be punished for offences in Cyprus by seizure of Beirut. This would have important consequences for the crusade, as it alienated the powerful [[House of Ibelin|Ibelin faction]], turning them against the emperor.\n\n===In the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\nAcre, as the nominal capital of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the seat of the [[Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Latin Patriarchate]], was split in its support for Frederick. Frederick's own army and the [[Teutonic Knights]] supported him, but Patriarch [[Gerald of Lausanne]] (and the clergy) followed the hostile papal line. Once news of Frederick's excommunication had spread, public support for him waned considerably. The position of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and [[Knights Templar]] is more complicated; though they refused to join the emperor's army directly, they supported the crusade once Frederick agreed to have his name removed from official orders. The native barons greeted Frederick enthusiastically at first, but were wary of the emperor's history of centralization and his desire to impose imperial authority. This was largely due to Frederick's treatment of John of Ibelin in Cyprus, and his apparent disdain for the constitutional concerns of the barons.\n\n===Diplomatic agreement with Sultan al-Kamil===\nEven with the military orders on board, Frederick's force was a mere shadow of the army that had amassed when the crusade had originally been called. He realised that his only hope of success in the Holy Land was to negotiate for the surrender of Jerusalem as he lacked the manpower to engage the [[Ayyubid]] empire in battle. Frederick hoped that a token show of force, a threatening march down the coast, would be enough to convince [[al-Kamil]], the [[sultan]] of [[Egypt]], to honor a proposed agreement that had been negotiated some years earlier, prior to the death of [[Al-Mu'azzam|al-Muazzam]], the governor of [[Damascus]]. The Egyptian sultan, occupied with the suppression of rebellious forces in Syria, agreed to cede Jerusalem to the [[Franks]], along with a narrow corridor to the coast.\n\nIn addition, Frederick received [[Nazareth]], [[Sidon]], [[Jaffa]], and [[Bethlehem]]. Other lordships may have been returned to Christian control, but sources disagree. It was, however, a treaty of compromise. The Muslims retained control over the [[Temple Mount]] area of Jerusalem, the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]], and the [[Dome of the Rock]]. The [[Oultrejordain|Transjordan]] castles stayed in Ayyubid hands, and Arab sources suggest that Frederick was not permitted to restore Jerusalem's fortifications, although the Crusaders did in fact restore Jerusalem's defensive walls. The treaty was closed on the 18th of February, 1229, and also involved a 10-year truce.\n\nOne of the results of the treaty was that Jews were once more prohibited from living in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"jewishhistory\" /><ref>My Jerusalem: Essays, Reminiscences, and Poems.

It began seven years after the failure of the [[Fifth Crusade]] and involved very little actual fighting. The diplomatic maneuvering of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[King of Sicily]], [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], resulted in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] regaining some control over Jerusalem for much of the ensuing fifteen years (1229\u20131239, 1241\u20131244)<ref name=\"Boas\" /> as well as over other areas of the Holy Land.\n\n==Frederick II and the Papacy==\n[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], had involved himself broadly in the [[Fifth Crusade]], sending troops from Germany, but he failed to accompany the army directly, despite the encouragement of [[Honorius III]] and later [[Gregory IX]], as he needed to consolidate his position in Germany and Italy before embarking on a [[crusade]]. However, Frederick again promised to go on a crusade after his coronation as emperor in 1220 by [[Pope Honorius III]].\n\nIn 1225 Frederick married [[Isabella II of Jerusalem]] (also known as Yolande), daughter of [[John of Brienne]] (nominal ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]) and [[Maria of Montferrat]]. Frederick now had a claim to the truncated kingdom, and reason to attempt to restore it.<ref name=\"war_religion\" /> In 1227, after [[Pope Gregory IX|Gregory IX]] became [[pope]], Frederick's army set sail from [[Brindisi]] for [[Akko|Acre]] (then the capital of the truncated Kingdom of Jerusalem), but an epidemic forced Frederick to return to [[Italy]]. Gregory took this opportunity to [[excommunication|excommunicate]] Frederick for breaking his crusader vow, though this was just an excuse, as Frederick had for years been trying to consolidate imperial power in Italy at the expense of the [[papacy]].\n\nIn June 1228 Frederick made his last effort to be reconcile with Gregory, sending Archbishop [[Albert I of K\u00e4fernburg|Albert of Magdeburg]] and two Sicilian justiciars to speak with the pope. It had no effect and the excommunicated Frederick sailed from [[Brindisi]] on 28 June. The fleet was under the command of Admiral [[Henry of Malta]] and the archbishops of [[Archbishop of Palermo|Palermo]], [[Archbishop of Reggio|Reggio]], [[Archbishop of Capua|Capua]] and [[Archbishop of Bari|Bari]] accompanied him. He had only a small force with him, since the main force had sailed in August 1227 and reinforcements in April 1228.<ref>Van Cleve 1972, p. 206.</ref>\n\n==The Crusade==\n[[File:Sixi\u00e8me croisade-es.svg|thumb|Map of Sixth Crusade]]\n\n===Stopover in Cyprus===\nThe route of Frederick's fleet can be traced day-by-day. On 29 June it stopped in [[Otranto]], whence it crossed the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the island of [[Othonoi]] on 30 June. It was in [[Corfu]] on 1 July, Porto Guiscardo in [[Cephalonia]] on 2 July, [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] on 4 July, Portocaglie near [[Cape Matapan]] on 5 July, [[Cerigo]] on 6 July and it reached [[Souda Bay]] on [[Crete]] on 7 July. The fleet moved slowly along the Cretan coast, pausing for a whole day at [[Heraklion]] before crossing the [[Aegean Sea]] to [[Rhodes]] during 12\u201315 July. They sailed along the [[Anatolia]]n coast to Phenika, where they stayed on 16\u201317 July replenishing their water supplies. The fleet then crossed the sea to Cyprus, arriving at [[Limassol]] on 21 July.<ref>Van Cleve 1972, p. 207.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] had been an imperial fief since the Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], Frederick's father, had accepted the homage of [[Aimery of Cyprus|Aimery of Lusignan]] and made him king on the eve of the [[German Crusade]] in 1196.<ref>Van Cleve 1972, p. 213.</ref> The emperor arrived with the clear intent of stamping his authority on the kingdom, but was treated cordially by the native barons until a dispute arose between him and the constable of Cyprus, [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin]].

After recording, the images stored on the medium can be played back in [[slow motion]]. Early high-speed cameras used film to record the high-speed events, but were superseded by entirely electronic devices using either a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) or a [[CMOS]] [[active pixel sensor]], recording, typically, over 1,000 frames per second onto [[DRAM]], to be played back slowly to study the motion for scientific study of transient phenomena.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.motionvideoproducts.com/MVP%20papers/HSV%20White%20Paper.pdf |title=High Frame Rate Electronic Imaging |access-date=2010-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000301/http://www.motionvideoproducts.com/MVP%20papers/HSV%20White%20Paper.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nA high-speed camera can be classified as:\n# A high-speed film camera which records to film,\n# A high-speed video camera which records to electronic memory,\n# A high-speed framing camera which records images on multiple image planes or multiple locations on the same image plane<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aimed-research.com/help.html | title=High-Speed Camera Tutorials}}</ref> (generally film or a network of CCD cameras),\n# A high-speed streak camera which records a series of line-sized images to film or electronic memory.\n\nA normal [[Film|motion picture]] film is played back at 24 [[frames per second]], while television uses 25 frames/s ([[PAL]]) or 29.97 frames/s ([[NTSC]]).

One of the basic analysis techniques is to use high-speed cameras in order to characterize events which happen too fast to see, e.g. during production. Similar to use in science, with a pre- or post-triggering capability the camera can simply record continuously as the mechanic waits for the breakdown to happen, following which a trigger signal (internal or external) will stop the recording and allow the investigator to save a given time interval prior to the trigger (determined by frame rate, image size, and memory capacity during continuous recording). Some software allows viewing the issues in real time, by displaying only a subset of recorded frames, minimizing file size and watch time issues by eliminating useless frames before or after the sequence of interest.\n\nHigh-speed video cameras are used to augment other industrial technologies such as x-ray radiography.  When used with the proper phosphor screen which converts x-rays into visible light, high-speed cameras can be used to capture high-speed x-ray videos of events inside mechanical devices and biological specimens. The imaging speed is mainly limited by the phosphor screen decay rate and intensity gain which has a direct relationship on the camera's exposure. Pulsed x-ray sources limit frame rate and should be properly synchronized with camera frame captures.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aimed-research.com/Services.html | title=High-Speed Imaging Services - Aimed Research}}</ref>\n\n==Uses in warfare==\nIn 1950 [[Morton Sultanoff]], an engineer for the U.S.&nbsp;Army at Aberdeen Proving ground, invented a super high-speed camera that took frames at one-millionth of a second, and was fast enough to record the shock wave of a small explosion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA158&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WSfYT4GmKcOA2wW3ycWOCw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzgy#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Super Speed Camera Films Shock Wave\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1950, p. 158.</ref> High Speed digital cameras have been used to study how mines dropped from the air will deploy in near-shore regions,<ref>weapon development{{cite web |last= Chu |first= Dr. Peter C. |title= Non-Cylindrical Mine Drop Experiment |url= http://faculty.nps.edu/pcchu/web_paper/proceedings/jcot/midex2.pdf |accessdate= 4 May 2006 |publisher= Seventh International Symposium on Technology and Mine Problem, NPS, Monterey, California, USA }}.

Similar to use in science, with a pre- or post-triggering capability the camera can simply record continuously as the mechanic waits for the breakdown to happen, following which a trigger signal (internal or external) will stop the recording and allow the investigator to save a given time interval prior to the trigger (determined by frame rate, image size, and memory capacity during continuous recording). Some software allows viewing the issues in real time, by displaying only a subset of recorded frames, minimizing file size and watch time issues by eliminating useless frames before or after the sequence of interest.\n\nHigh-speed video cameras are used to augment other industrial technologies such as x-ray radiography.  When used with the proper phosphor screen which converts x-rays into visible light, high-speed cameras can be used to capture high-speed x-ray videos of events inside mechanical devices and biological specimens. The imaging speed is mainly limited by the phosphor screen decay rate and intensity gain which has a direct relationship on the camera's exposure. Pulsed x-ray sources limit frame rate and should be properly synchronized with camera frame captures.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aimed-research.com/Services.html | title=High-Speed Imaging Services - Aimed Research}}</ref>\n\n==Uses in warfare==\nIn 1950 [[Morton Sultanoff]], an engineer for the U.S.&nbsp;Army at Aberdeen Proving ground, invented a super high-speed camera that took frames at one-millionth of a second, and was fast enough to record the shock wave of a small explosion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA158&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WSfYT4GmKcOA2wW3ycWOCw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzgy#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Super Speed Camera Films Shock Wave\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1950, p. 158.</ref> High Speed digital cameras have been used to study how mines dropped from the air will deploy in near-shore regions,<ref>weapon development{{cite web |last= Chu |first= Dr. Peter C. |title= Non-Cylindrical Mine Drop Experiment |url= http://faculty.nps.edu/pcchu/web_paper/proceedings/jcot/midex2.pdf |accessdate= 4 May 2006 |publisher= Seventh International Symposium on Technology and Mine Problem, NPS, Monterey, California, USA }}.  By using high speed digital cameras to record and playback the images in slow motion, the trajectory of a mine entering into the water can be optimized for accuracy by adjusting the shape of the mine and the entry angle into the water.

The piece is in the ''[[tintinnabular]]'' style, wherein a ''melodic voice'', operating over [[diatonic scales]], and ''tintinnabular voice'', operating within a [[triad (music)|triad]] on the [[tonic (music)|tonic]], accompany each other. It is about ten minutes long.\n\n==Description==\nThe piece was originally written for a single [[piano]] and [[violin]] \u2013 though the violin has often been replaced with either a [[cello]] or a [[viola]]. Versions also exist for [[double bass]], [[clarinet]], [[French horn|horn]], [[flugelhorn]], [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[bassoon]], [[trombone]], and [[percussion]]. The piece is an example of [[minimal music]].\n\nThe piece is in [[F major]] in 6/4 time, with the piano playing rising [[crotchet]] triads and the second instrument playing slow F major scales, alternately rising and falling, of increasing length, which all end on the note A (the [[mediant]] of F).
