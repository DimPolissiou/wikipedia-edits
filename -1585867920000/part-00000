On the northern tip of the peninsula the [[Story Bridge]] connects it to the [[Brisbane central business district|central business district]] and the suburb of [[Fortitude Valley]]. The suburb of [[Woolloongabba]] is located to the south. The six-lane Main Street runs from Story Bridge to Woolloongabba. The landscape of Kangaroo Point is predominantly high rise apartments towards the tip of the peninsula while the southern end is predominantly low-medium density apartments and [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] type houses.\n\nAt the northern tip of the peninsula is Captain Burke Park ({{Coord|-27.4653|153.0350|type:landmark_region:AU-QLD|display=|name=Captain Burke Park}}) with the [[Holman Street ferry wharf]], barbeques, picnic facilities, playground, and outdoor fitness facilities.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/things-to-see-and-do/council-venues-and-precincts/parks/parks-by-suburb/kangaroo-point-parks|title=Kangaroo Point parks|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Brisbane City Council]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 126315 Naval Stores at Kangaroo Point, seen from across the Brisbane River.jpg|thumb|right|The Queensland [[Naval Stores, Kangaroo Point|Navy's main stores]] below the Kangaroo Point cliffs, with the gunship ''Paluma'' moored in the Brisbane River in the 1890s.]]\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 101720.jpg|thumb|Kangaroo Point Ferry Terminal ca. 1928]]\nBefore British [[colonization|settlement]], Kangaroo Point was settled by the [[Turrbal]] people.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dakibudtcha.com.au/turrbal_history.htm |title=Turrbal History |access-date=11 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026221727/http://www.dakibudtcha.com.au/turrbal_history.htm |archive-date=26 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is one of the earliest suburbs settled in Brisbane and subsequently, is one of Brisbane's oldest suburbs, rich in history and character.

The first ship-based radio transmission in Australia was made between [[HMQS Gayundah|HMAS ''Gayundah'']] and the buildings in 1903. The naval stores buildings were occupied by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] until 1959, and then by the [[Australian Army]] until 1984.

Kangaroo Point is also home to the more-than-160-year-old St Mary's Anglican Church.\n\n[[File:Brisbane During Twilight.jpg|thumb|right|Brisbane's [[Brisbane central business district|CBD]] from Kangaroo Point cliffs]]\nThe cliffs are a popular picnic, [[rock climbing]] and [[abseiling]] site. The steepness of the cliffs was increased by quarrying operations which mined the [[volcanic rock]] or [[rhyolite]] [[lava]] flows which form the cliffs. The lava was deposited in the [[Triassic]] Period about 230 million years ago and filled up an ancient river valley. They currently form the banks of the Brisbane River.\n\nThe [[Story Bridge]] is a prominent landmark.

central business district]], but being on the south side of the river is normally regarded as a southern suburb.\n\nKangaroo Point is located on a [[peninsula]] formed of harder [[rhyolite]] rock which the [[Brisbane River]] flows around. On the northern tip of the peninsula the [[Story Bridge]] connects it to the [[Brisbane central business district|central business district]] and the suburb of [[Fortitude Valley]]. The suburb of [[Woolloongabba]] is located to the south. The six-lane Main Street runs from Story Bridge to Woolloongabba. The landscape of Kangaroo Point is predominantly high rise apartments towards the tip of the peninsula while the southern end is predominantly low-medium density apartments and [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] type houses.\n\nAt the northern tip of the peninsula is Captain Burke Park ({{Coord|-27.4653|153.0350|type:landmark_region:AU-QLD|display=|name=Captain Burke Park}}) with the [[Holman Street ferry wharf]], barbeques, picnic facilities, playgound, and outdoor fitness facilities.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/things-to-see-and-do/council-venues-and-precincts/parks/parks-by-suburb/kangaroo-point-parks|title=Kangaroo Point parks|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Brisbane City Council]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 126315 Naval Stores at Kangaroo Point, seen from across the Brisbane River.jpg|thumb|right|The Queensland [[Naval Stores, Kangaroo Point|Navy's main stores]] below the Kangaroo Point cliffs, with the gunship ''Paluma'' moored in the Brisbane River in the 1890s.]]\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 101720.jpg|thumb|Kangaroo Point Ferry Terminal ca. 1928]]\nBefore British [[colonization|settlement]], Kangaroo Point was settled by the [[Turrbal]] people.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dakibudtcha.com.au/turrbal_history.htm |title=Turrbal History |access-date=11 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026221727/http://www.dakibudtcha.com.au/turrbal_history.htm |archive-date=26 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is one of the earliest suburbs settled in Brisbane and subsequently, is one of Brisbane's oldest suburbs, rich in history and character.

Subsequently, the area was opened up for free settlement, the first land sales taking place on 13 December 1843.

Until the 1930s, Evans Anderson & Phelan built steam locomotives at their Kangaroo Point works for [[Queensland Rail]]ways, however their works were not located near a railway, so the completed locomotives were delivered along Main Street on temporary track.\n\nUntil the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, the Queensland Navy's main storage facility was located in the suburb. The first ship-based radio transmission in Australia was made between [[HMQS Gayundah|HMAS ''Gayundah'']] and the buildings in 1903. The naval stores buildings were occupied by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] until 1959, and then by the [[Australian Army]] until 1984. The heritage-listed buildings are now used by an adventure company focussing on river activities and rock climbing.\n\nThe opening of the Story Bridge ({{Coord|-27.4693|153.0359|type:landmark_region:AU-QLD|display=|name=Story Bridge (Kangaroo Point end)}}) in July 1940 was the most significant development of the suburb.

Kangaroo Point is also home to Ellis Street, one of the 20 steepest hills in Brisbane according to Brisbane City Council. Kangaroo Point is also home to the more-than-160-year-old St Mary's Anglican Church.\n\n[[File:Brisbane During Twilight.jpg|thumb|right|Brisbane's [[Brisbane central business district|CBD]] from Kangaroo Point cliffs]]\nThe cliffs are a popular picnic, [[rock climbing]] and [[abseiling]] site. The steepness of the cliffs was increased by quarrying operations which mined the [[volcanic rock]] or [[rhyolite]] [[lava]] flows which form the cliffs. The lava was deposited in the [[Triassic]] Period about 230 million years ago and filled up an ancient river valley. They currently form the banks of the Brisbane River.\n\nThe [[Story Bridge]] is a prominent landmark. It is able to be climbed with authorised tourist groups and provides the main means of access to the north of Brisbane.

Rules governing the relationship between brothel-keepers and the authorities were set out in lease agreements, and frequently in oaths sworn by brothel-keepers which required them to make promises of loyalty and obedience.

The first witness was named Anna von Ulm, whose testimony supplied the majority of the evidence. Those who followed her were named Adelhait von Sindelfingen, Anna von Schaffhausen, Catrin von N\u00fcrnberg, Ch\u00fcndlin von Augsburg, Cristina von der Etsch, Els von N\u00fcrnberg, Enndlin von Schaffhausen, Margrette von Biberach, and W\u00ffchselbrunn von Ulm. Another woman, Ursel von Konstanz, had since left N\u00f6rdlingen to work in Nuremberg's public brothel; she was therefore interrogated by the Nuremberg city council at the request of the council in N\u00f6rdlingen, who received a copy of her statement. \n\nThe women's testimony revealed a widespread pattern of abuse and exploitation at the hands of Lienhart Fryermut and Barbara Tarschenfeindin. This included practices such as forcing the women to work while menstruating; forcing them to work on holy days; denying them the chance to go to church to hear Mass; confiscating their clothes and forcing them to buy items from them at excessive prices; feeding them disgusting food; forcing them to spin cloth to generate extra income; seizing tips given to them by customers and taking more than the permitted one-third cut from their wages. Many of the women said they had routinely suffered violence at Lienhart's hands, and that he sometimes used a bullwhip to beat them. Almost all of the women stated that they were in debt to Lienhart and as a consequence were unable to leave the brothel, notwithstanding the fact that he forbade them to leave the building most of the time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Page |first1=Jamie |title=Inside the Medieval Brothel |journal=History Today |date=June 2019 |volume=6 |issue=69 |pages=34-36 |url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/feature/inside-medieval-brothel}}</ref> \n\n===The abortion inquiry===\n\nAs well as testifying about working conditions in the brothel, many of the women also described the events surrounding the alleged abortion of Els von Eystett's child, including Els herself. Els claimed in her own statement that she had first complained of abdominal pains to Barbara. Barbara had told her that she was merely suffering from [[amenorrhea]], and stated that she would mix up a drink to bring on menstruation. Having dispatched Anna von Ulm and Margrette von Biberach to fetch ingredients from the market, Barbara then mixed together [[Vinca|periwinkle]], cloves, carrot (likely to have been [[daucus carota]], a known abortifacient) and strong wine into a hot draught, which, Els claimed, she was forced to drink.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Page |first1=Jamie |title=Inside the Medieval Brothel |journal=History Today |date=June 2019 |volume=6 |issue=69 |page=30 |url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/feature/inside-medieval-brothel}}</ref>  \n\nSeveral witnesses including Els, Margrette von Biberach and Anna von Ulm testified that the drink rapidly brought on strong abdominal pains. This caused Els to miscarried a male foetus which Els herself estimated to be twenty weeks old. After her miscarriage Els was forced to return to work, and revealed to at least one customer what had happened to her. After rumours of what had happened had reached the city council, but before the latter had acted, Barbara and Lienhart agreed to release Els from her debts and allow her to leave the brothel, on the condition that she not reveal what had happened; having left N\u00f6rdlingen, Els subsequently went to [[Wei\u00dfenburg in Bayern]], where she was eventually tracked down after the investigation was launched in N\u00f6rdlingen.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Page |first1=Jamie |title=Inside the Medieval Brothel |journal=History Today |date=June 2019 |volume=6 |issue=69 |page=30 |url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/feature/inside-medieval-brothel}}</ref>\n\n===Consequences of the investigation===\n\nFollowing the interrogation of the women of N\u00f6rdlingen's brothel, both Lienhart Fryermut and Barbara Tarschenfeindin were themselves interrogated.

Its goal is to provide [[thermal comfort]] and acceptable [[indoor air quality]]. HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of [[mechanical engineering]], based on the principles of [[thermodynamics]], [[fluid mechanics]] and [[heat transfer]]. \"[[Refrigeration]]\" is sometimes added to the field's abbreviation, as '''HVAC&R''' or '''HVACR''' or \"ventilation\" is dropped, as in '''HACR''' (as in the designation of HACR-rated [[circuit breaker]]s).\n\nHVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as [[skyscraper]]s and hospitals, vehicles such as cars, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and [[Sick building syndrome|healthy building]] conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.\n\nVentilating or [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] (the \"V\" in HVAC)  is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.\n\nVentilation includes both the exchange of air to the outside as well as circulation of air within the building. It is one of the most important factors for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality in buildings. Methods for ventilating a building may be divided into ''mechanical/forced'' and ''[[Natural ventilation|natural]]'' types.<ref>[https://www.ashrae.org/advertising/handbook-advertising/fundamentals/ventilation-and-infiltration Ventilation and Infiltration chapter], Fundamentals volume of the ''[[ASHRAE Handbook]]'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2005</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe three major functions of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning are interrelated, especially with the need to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality within reasonable installation, operation, and maintenance costs. HVAC systems can be used in both domestic and commercialhttps://sayedcoolingsolution.com/ environments. HVAC systems can provide ventilation, and maintain pressure relationships between spaces. The means of air delivery and removal from spaces is known as [[room air distribution]].<ref name=\"Rock and Zhu\">''Designer's Guide to Ceiling-Based Air Diffusion'', Rock and Zhu, [[ASHRAE]], Inc., [[New York (state)|New York]], 2002</ref>\n\n=== Individual systems ===\n{{See also|HVAC control system}}\n\nIn modern buildings, the design, installation, and [[HVAC control system|control systems]] of these functions are integrated into one or more HVAC systems. For very small buildings, contractors normally estimate the capacity and type of system needed and then design the system, selecting the appropriate refrigerant and various components needed. For larger buildings, building service designers, mechanical engineers, or [[Building engineering|building services]] engineers analyze, design, and specify the HVAC systems. Specialty mechanical contractors then fabricate and commission the systems. Building permits and code-compliance inspections of the installations are normally required for all sizes of building.\n\n=== District networks ===\nAlthough HVAC is executed in individual buildings or other enclosed spaces (like [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD's]] underground headquarters), the equipment involved is in some cases an extension of a larger [[district heating]] (DH) or [[district cooling]] (DC) network, or a combined DHC network. In such cases, the operating and maintenance aspects are simplified and metering becomes necessary to bill for the energy that is consumed, and in some cases energy that is returned to the larger system. For example, at a given time one building may be utilizing chilled water for air conditioning and the warm water it returns may be used in another building for heating, or for the overall heating-portion of the DHC network (likely with energy added to boost the temperature).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.04.020|title=District heating and cooling: Review of technology and potential enhancements|journal=Applied Energy|volume=93|pages=2\u201310|year=2012|last1=Rezaie|first1=Behnaz|last2=Rosen|first2=Marc A.}} </ref><ref>Werner S.

Coyne College was the first school to offer HVAC training in 1899.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Heating, Air Conditioning & Refrigeration|url=https://www.coynecollege.edu/programs/hvac|website=Coyne College}}</ref>\n\nThe invention of the components of HVAC systems went hand-in-hand with the [[industrial revolution]], and new methods of modernization, higher efficiency, and system control are constantly being introduced by companies and inventors worldwide.\n\n== Heating ==\n{{main|Central heating}}\n{{Redirect|Heater}}\nHeaters are appliances whose purpose is to generate heat (i.e. warmth) for the building. This can be done via [[central heating]]. Such a system contains a [[boiler]], [[furnace]], or [[heat pump]] to heat water, steam, or air in a central location such as a [[furnace room]] in a home, or a [[mechanical room]] in a large building. The heat can be transferred by [[convection]], conduction, or [[radiation]].\n\n=== Generation ===\n[[File:Panna.jpg|thumb|upright|Central heating unit]]\nHeaters exist for various types of fuel, including [[Fuel#Solid fuel|solid fuels]], [[Fuel#Liquid fuel|liquids]], and [[Fuel#Gaseous fuels|gases]]. Another type of heat source is [[Electric heating|electricity]], normally heating ribbons composed of high resistance wire (see [[Nichrome]]). This principle is also used for baseboard heaters and [[Space heater|portable heaters]]. Electrical heaters are often used as backup or supplemental heat for heat pump systems.\n\nThe heat pump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255759857 |title=A review of domestic heat pumps |author=Iain Staffell, Dan Brett, Nigel Brandon and Adam Hawkes |date=30 May 2014}}</ref> Heat pumps can extract heat from [[Heat pump#Heat sources and sinks|various sources]], such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air inside. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate climates, but with improvements in low temperature operation and reduced loads due to more efficient homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler climates.\n\n=== Distribution ===\n\n==== Water/steam ====\nIn the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the rooms. Most modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (as opposed to older [[Water heating#Gravity-fed system|gravity-fed systems]]). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using [[radiator (heating)|radiators]], hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.\n\nThe use of water as the heat transfer medium is known as [[hydronics]]. The heated water can also supply an auxiliary heat exchanger to supply hot water for bathing and washing.\n\n==== Air ====\nWarm air systems distribute heated air through duct work systems of supply and return air through metal or fiberglass ducts. Many systems use the same ducts to distribute air cooled by an evaporator coil for air conditioning. The air supply is normally filtered through air cleaners to remove dust and pollen particles.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Dangers ===\nThe use of furnaces, space heaters, and boilers as a method of indoor heating could result in incomplete combustion and the emission of [[carbon monoxide]], [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]], [[formaldehyde]], [[volatile organic compound]]s, and other combustion byproducts. Incomplete combustion occurs when there is insufficient oxygen; the inputs are fuels containing various contaminants and the outputs are harmful byproducts, most dangerously carbon monoxide, which is a tasteless and odorless gas with serious adverse health effects.<ref>{{cite book | last=Bearg | first=David W. | title=Indoor Air Quality and HVAC Systems | year=1993 | publisher=Lewis Publishers | location=New York | pages=107\u2013112}}</ref>\n\nWithout proper ventilation, carbon monoxide can be lethal at concentrations of 1000 ppm (0.1%). However, at several hundred ppm, carbon monoxide exposure induces headaches, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin in the blood, forming carboxyhemoglobin, reducing the blood's ability to transport oxygen. The primary health concerns associated with carbon monoxide exposure are its cardiovascular and neurobehavioral effects. Carbon monoxide can cause atherosclerosis (the hardening of arteries) and can also trigger heart attacks. Neurologically, carbon monoxide exposure reduces hand to eye coordination, vigilance, and continuous performance. It can also affect time discrimination.<ref>{{cite web | last=Dianat, Nazari | first=I,I | title=Characteristic of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning in Northwest Iran- Tabriz | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ | publisher=International Journal of Injury Control and Promotion | accessdate=2011-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Ventilation==\n{{Main|Ventilation (architecture)}}\nVentilation is the process of changing or replacing air in any space to control temperature or remove any combination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, or carbon dioxide, and to replenish oxygen. Ventilation includes both the exchange of air with the outside as well as circulation of air within the building. It is one of the most important factors for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality in buildings. Methods for ventilating a building may be divided into ''mechanical/forced'' and ''natural'' types.<ref>Ventilation and Infiltration chapter, Fundamentals volume of the ''ASHRAE Handbook'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia, 2005</ref>\n\n=== Mechanical or forced ventilation ===\n[[File:HVAC Ventilation Exhaust.jpg|thumb|HVAC ventilation exhaust for a 12-story building]]\nMechanical, or forced, ventilation is provided by an [[air handler]] (AHU) and used to control indoor air quality. Excess [[humidity]], odors, and contaminants can often be controlled via dilution or replacement with outside air. However, in humid climates more energy is required to remove excess moisture from ventilation air.\n\nKitchens and bathrooms typically have mechanical exhausts to control odors and sometimes humidity. Factors in the design of such systems include the flow rate (which is a function of the fan speed and exhaust vent size) and noise level. [[Direct drive mechanism|Direct drive]] fans are available for many applications, and can reduce maintenance needs.\n\nCeiling [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]] and table/floor fans circulate air within a room for the purpose of reducing the perceived temperature by increasing evaporation of perspiration on the skin of the occupants. Because hot air rises, ceiling fans may be used to keep a room warmer in the winter by circulating the warm stratified air from the ceiling to the floor.\n\n=== Natural ventilation ===\n[[File:N&AMOV - Schoolroom - Impulsion.png|thumb|Ventilation on the [[downdraught]] system, by impulsion, or the [[Plenum space|'plenum' principle]], applied to schoolrooms (1899)]]\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Chimney]] -->\nNatural ventilation is the ventilation of a building with outside air without using fans or other mechanical systems. It can be via operable windows, louvers, or [[trickle vent]]s when spaces are small and the architecture permits. In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to rise and flow out high building openings to the outside ([[stack effect]]), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use very little energy, but care must be taken to ensure comfort. In warm or humid climates, maintaining thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation might not be possible. [[Air conditioning]] systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side [[Economizer#HVAC|economizers]] also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.\n\nAn important component of natural ventilation is air change rate or [[air changes per hour]]: the hourly rate of ventilation divided by the volume of the space. For example, six air changes per hour means an amount of new air, equal to the volume of the space, is added every ten minutes. For human comfort, a minimum of four air changes per hour is typical, though warehouses might have only two. Too high of an air change rate may be uncomfortable, akin to a [[wind tunnel]] which have thousands of changes per hour. The highest air change rates are for crowded spaces, bars, night clubs, commercial kitchens at around 30 to 50 air changes per hour.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-change-rate-room-d_867.html\n | title = Air Change Rates for typical Rooms and Buildings\n | publisher = The Engineering ToolBox\n | accessdate = 2012-12-12\n}}</ref>\n\nRoom pressure can be either positive or negative with respect to outside the room. Positive pressure occurs when there is more air being supplied than exhausted, and is common to reduce the infiltration of outside contaminants.<ref>{{cite web | last=Bell | first=Geoffrey | title=Room Air Change Rate | url=http://ateam.lbl.gov/Design-Guide/DGHtm/roomairchangerates.htm | publisher=A Design Guide for Energy-Efficient Research Laboratories | accessdate=2011-11-15}}</ref>\n\n====Airborne diseases====\nNatural ventilation is a key factor in reducing the spread of airborne illnesses such as tuberculosis, the common cold, influenza and meningitis. Opening doors, windows, and using ceiling fans are all ways to maximize natural ventilation and reduce the risk of airborne contagion. Natural ventilation requires little maintenance and is inexpensive.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Escombe |first=A. R. |last2=Oeser |first2=C. C. |last3=Gilman |first3=R.

Air conditioned buildings often have sealed windows, because open windows would work against the system intended to maintain constant indoor air conditions. Outside, fresh air is generally drawn into the system by a vent into the indoor heat exchanger section, creating positive air pressure. The percentage of return air made up of fresh air can usually be manipulated by adjusting the opening of this vent. Typical fresh air intake is about 10%.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAir conditioning and refrigeration are provided through the removal of heat. Heat can be removed through [[thermal radiation|radiation]], convection, or [[Thermal conduction|conduction]]. Refrigeration conduction media such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as [[refrigerant]]s. A refrigerant is employed either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is used to drive thermodynamic [[refrigeration cycle]], or in a free cooling system which uses pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (typically water or a glycol mix).\n\nIt is imperative that the air conditioning horsepower is sufficient for the area being cooled. Underpowered air conditioning system will lead to power wastage and inefficient usage. Adequate horsepower is required for any air conditioner installed.\n\n=== Refrigeration cycle ===\n{{main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}\n[[File:Heatpump.svg|thumb|A simple stylized diagram of the refrigeration cycle: 1)&nbsp;[[condensing coil]], 2)&nbsp;[[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], 3)&nbsp;[[evaporator coil]], 4)&nbsp;[[Gas compressor|compressor]]]]\nThe refrigeration cycle uses four essential elements to cool.\n* The system refrigerant starts its cycle in a gaseous state. The '''compressor''' pumps the refrigerant gas up to a high pressure and temperature.\n* From there it enters a heat exchanger (sometimes called a '''condensing coil''' or condenser) where it loses energy (heat) to the outside, cools, and condenses into its liquid phase.\n* An '''[[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]]''' (also called metering device) regulates the refrigerant liquid to flow at the proper rate.\n* The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an '''evaporating coil''' or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs energy (heat) from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.\n\nIn variable climates, the system may include a [[reversing valve]] that switches from heating in winter to cooling in summer. By reversing the flow of refrigerant, the heat pump refrigeration cycle is changed from cooling to heating or vice versa. This allows a facility to be heated and cooled by a single piece of equipment by the same means, and with the same hardware.\n\n=== Free cooling ===\n{{main|Free cooling}}\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a [[heat sink]] when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.\n\nSome systems include an \"economizer mode\", which is sometimes called a \"free-cooling mode\". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion \"DX\" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the [[enthalpy]] of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.\n\n===Packaged vs. split system===\nCentral, \"all-air\" air-conditioning systems (or package systems) with a combined outdoor condenser/evaporator unit are often installed in North American residences, offices, and public buildings, but are difficult to retrofit (install in a building that was not designed to receive it) because of the bulky air ducts required. (Minisplit ductless systems are used in these situations.) Outside of North America, packaged systems are only used in limited applications involving large indoor space such as stadiums, theatres or exhibition halls.\n\nAn alternative to packaged systems is the use of separate indoor and outdoor coils in [[Split-system air conditioner|split systems]]. Split systems are preferred and widely used worldwide except in North America. In North America, split systems are most often seen in residential applications, but they are gaining popularity in small commercial buildings.\nThe split systems are a great choice for small buildings where ductwork is not feasible or where the space conditioning efficiency is of prime concern.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-systems/ductless-mini-split-heat-pumps|title=Ductless, Mini-Split Heat Pumps|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref> The benefits of ductless air conditioning systems include easy installation, no ductwork, greater zonal control, flexibility of control and quiet operation.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} In space conditioning, the duct losses can account for 30% of energy consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners|title=Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=29 November 2019}}</ref> The use of minisplit can result in energy savings in space conditioning as there are no losses associated with ducting.\n\nWith the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.\n\nSplit systems are more efficient and the footprint is typically smaller than the package systems. On the other hand, package systems tend to have slightly lower indoor noise level compared to split system since the fan motor is located outside.\n\n=== Dehumidification ===\nDehumidification (air drying) in an air conditioning system is provided by the evaporator. Since the evaporator operates at a temperature below the [[dew point]], moisture in the air condenses on the evaporator coil tubes. This moisture is collected at the bottom of the evaporator in a pan and removed by piping to a central drain or onto the ground outside.\n\nA [[dehumidifier]] is an air-conditioner-like device that controls the humidity of a room or building. It is often employed in basements which have a higher [[relative humidity]] because of their lower temperature (and propensity for damp floors and walls). In food retailing establishments, large open chiller cabinets are highly effective at dehumidifying the internal air. Conversely, a humidifier increases the humidity of a building.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nAll modern air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.\n\nBecause an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.\n\n==Energy efficiency==\nSince the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more efficient. This was originally driven by rising energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues. Additionally, improvements to the HVAC system efficiency can also help increase occupant health and productivity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sustainable Facilities Tool: HVAC System Overview|url=https://sftool.gov/explore/green-building/section/9/hvac/system-overview|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> In the US, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] has imposed tighter restrictions over the years. There are several methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.\n\n===Heating energy===\nIn the past, water heating was more efficient for heating buildings and was the standard in the United States. Today, [[forced air]] systems can double for air conditioning and are more popular.\n\nSome benefits of forced air systems, which are now widely used in churches, schools and high-end residences, are\n* Better air conditioning effects\n* Energy savings of up to 15-20%\n* Even conditioning{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\nA drawback is the installation cost, which can be slightly higher than traditional HVAC systems.\n\nEnergy efficiency can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control [[zone valve]]s, and in forced air systems they control [[zone damper]]s inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very critical to maintaining a proper temperature.\n\n[[Forecasting (heating)|Forecasting]] is another method of controlling building heating by calculating demand for heating energy that should be supplied to the building in each time unit.\n\n===Ground source heat pump===\n{{Main|Geothermal heat pump}}\nGround source, or geothermal, heat pumps are similar to ordinary heat pumps, but instead of transferring heat to or from outside air, they rely on the stable, even temperature of the earth to provide heating and air conditioning. Many regions experience seasonal temperature extremes, which would require large-capacity heating and cooling equipment to heat or cool buildings. For example, a conventional heat pump system used to heat a building in Montana's {{convert|-70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|lk=on}} low temperature or cool a building in the highest temperature ever recorded in the US\u2014{{convert|134|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in [[Death Valley]], California, in 1913 would require a large amount of energy due to the extreme difference between inside and outside air temperatures. A few feet below the earth's surface, however, the ground remains at a relatively constant temperature. Utilizing this large source of relatively moderate temperature earth, a heating or cooling system's capacity can often be significantly reduced. Although ground temperatures vary according to latitude, at {{convert|6|ft|m}} underground, temperatures generally only range from {{convert|45|to|75|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.\n\nAn example of a geothermal heat pump that uses a body of water as the heat sink, is the system used by the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] in Chicago, Illinois. This building is situated on the [[Chicago River]], and uses cold river water by pumping it into a recirculating cooling system, where heat exchangers transfer heat from the building into the water, and then the now-warmed water is pumped back into the Chicago River.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nWhile they may be more costly to install than regular heat pumps, geothermal heat pumps can produce markedly lower energy bills \u2013 30 to 40 percent lower, according to estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nGeothermal heat pumps still provide higher efficiency than air source heat pumps. Some models provide 70% saving compared to electric resistance heaters.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Ventilation energy recovery===\n[[Energy recovery]] systems sometimes utilize [[heat recovery ventilation]] or [[energy recovery ventilation]] systems that employ [[heat exchanger]]s or [[thermal wheel|enthalpy wheels]] to recover [[sensible heat|sensible]] or [[latent heat]] from exhausted air. This is done by transfer of energy to the incoming outside fresh air.\n\n===Air conditioning energy===\nThe performance of vapor compression refrigeration cycles is limited by [[Second law of thermodynamics|thermodynamics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-engineering/thermodynamics/thermodynamic-cycles/heating-and-air-conditioning/#Vapor-compression_Cycle_8211_Vapor-compression_Refrigeration|title=Heating and Air Conditioning|website=www.nuclear-power.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-10}}</ref> These air conditioning and heat pump devices ''move'' heat rather than convert it from one form to another, so ''[[Thermal efficiency|thermal efficiencies]]'' do not appropriately describe the performance of these devices. The Coefficient-of-Performance (COP) measures performance, but this dimensionless measure has not been adopted. Instead, the Energy Efficiency Ratio (''EER'') has traditionally been used to characterize the performance of many HVAC systems. EER is the Energy Efficiency Ratio based on a {{convert|35|C|F}} outdoor temperature. To more accurately describe the performance of air conditioning equipment over a typical cooling season a modified version of the EER, the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (''SEER''), or in Europe the [[ESEER]], is used. SEER ratings are based on seasonal temperature averages instead of a constant {{convert|35|\u00b0C}} outdoor temperature.

For example, the fan blades used to move the air are usually stamped from sheet metal, an economical method of manufacture, but as a result they are not aerodynamically efficient. A well-designed blade could reduce electrical power required to move the air by a third.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2010/07/15/keeping-cool-and-green Keeping cool and green], ''[[The Economist]]'' 17 July 2010, p. 83</ref>\n\n=== Demand controlled kitchen ventilation ===\n{{main|Demand controlled ventilation}}\nDemand controlled kitchen ventilation (DCKV) is a building controls approach of controlling the volume of kitchen exhaust and supply air in response to the actual cooking loads in a commercial kitchen. Traditional commercial kitchen ventilation systems operate at 100% fan speed independent of the volume of cooking activity and DCKV technology changes that to provide significant fan energy and conditioned air savings. By deploying smart sensing technology, both the exhaust and supply fans can be controlled to capitalize on the [[affinity laws]] for motor energy savings, reduce makeup air heating and cooling energy, increasing safety and reducing ambient kitchen noise levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/dckv_technology_profile.pdf|title=Technology Profile: Demand Control Kitchen Ventilation (DCKV)|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==Air filtration and cleaning==\n{{Main|Air filter}}\n[[File:Air handling unit.JPG|thumb|[[Air handling unit]], used for heating, cooling, and filtering the air]]\nAir cleaning and filtration removes particles, contaminants, vapors and gases from the air.

When determining CADR, the amount of airflow in a space is taken into account. For example, an air cleaner with a flow rate of 100 cfm (cubic feet per minute) and an efficiency of 50% has a CADR of 50 cfm. Along with CADR, filtration performance is very important when it comes to the air in our indoor environment. Filter performance depends on the size of the particle or fiber, the filter packing density and depth and also the air flow rate.<ref name=\"Howard 2003 1\u201363\"/>\n\n== HVAC industry and standards ==\nThe HVAC industry is a worldwide enterprise, with roles including operation and maintenance, system design and construction, equipment manufacturing and sales, and in education and research. The HVAC industry was historically regulated by the manufacturers of HVAC equipment, but regulating and standards organizations such as HARDI, [[ASHRAE]], [[SMACNA]], [[Air Conditioning Contractors of America|ACCA]], [[Uniform Mechanical Code]], [[International Building Code|International Mechanical Code]], and [[Air Movement and Controls Association|AMCA]] have been established to support the industry and encourage high standards and achievement.\n\nThe starting point in carrying out an estimate both for cooling and heating depends on the exterior climate and interior specified conditions. However, before taking up the heat load calculation, it is necessary to find fresh air requirements for each area in detail, as [[pressurization]] is an important consideration.\n\n=== International ===\n[[ISO 16813]]:2006 is one of the  [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] building environment standards.<ref>{{cite web|last=ISO|title=Building environment standards|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=54740|publisher=www.iso.org|accessdate=2011-05-14}}</ref> It establishes the general principles of building environment design.

ASHRAE is an international technical society for all individuals and organizations interested in HVAC. The Society, organized into regions, chapters, and student branches, allows exchange of HVAC knowledge and experiences for the benefit of the field's practitioners and the public. ASHRAE provides many opportunities to participate in the development of new knowledge via, for example, research and its many technical committees. These committees typically meet twice per year at the ASHRAE Annual and Winter Meetings. A popular product show, the AHR Expo, is held in conjunction with each winter meeting. The Society has approximately 50,000 members and has headquarters in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\nThe most recognized standards for HVAC design are based on ASHRAE data. The most general of four volumes of the ASHRAE Handbook is Fundamentals; it includes heating and cooling calculations. Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The design professional must consult ASHRAE data for the standards of design and care as the typical building codes provide little to no information on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do include much detail on installation requirements, however. Other useful reference materials include items from [[SMACNA]], [[ACGIH]], and technical trade journals.\n\nAmerican design standards are legislated in the Uniform Mechanical Code or International Mechanical Code. In certain states, counties, or cities, either of these codes may be adopted and amended via various legislative processes. These codes are updated and published by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials ([[IAPMO]]) or the International Code Council ([[International Code Council|ICC]]) respectively, on a 3-year code development cycle. Typically, local building permit departments are charged with enforcement of these standards on private and certain public properties.\n\nHVAC professionals in the US can receive training through formal training institutions, where most earn [[associate degree]]s. Training for HVAC technicians includes classroom lectures and hands-on tasks, and can be followed by an apprenticeship wherein the recent graduate works alongside a professional HVAC technician for a temporary period.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} HVAC techs who have been trained can also be certified in areas such as air conditioning, heat pumps, gas heating, and commercial refrigeration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.natex.org/technicians/certification-basics101/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006052206/http://www.natex.org/technicians/certification-basics101/ |archive-date=2011-10-06 |title=Certification basics/101 |publisher=NATE |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nThe [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] is a body that covers the essential [[Service (systems architecture)]] that allow buildings to operate. It includes the electrotechnical, [[heating]], [[ventilating]], air conditioning, refrigeration and [[plumbing]] industries. To [[train]] as a [[Building services engineering|building services engineer]], the [[academic]] requirements are GCSEs (A-C) / Standard Grades (1-3) in Maths and Science, which are important in measurements, planning and theory. Employers will often want a [[academic degree|degree]] in a branch of engineering, such as building environment [[engineering]], electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. To become a full member of CIBSE, and so also to be registered by the [[Engineering Council UK]] as a chartered engineer, engineers must also attain an Honours Degree and a master's degree in a relevant engineering subject.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\nCIBSE publishes several guides to HVAC design relevant to the UK market, and also the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. These guides include various recommended design criteria and standards, some of which are cited within the UK building regulations, and therefore form a legislative requirement for major building services works. The main guides are:\n* Guide A: Environmental Design\n* Guide B: Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration\n* Guide C: Reference Data\n* Guide D: Transportation systems in Buildings\n* Guide E: Fire Safety Engineering\n* Guide F: Energy Efficiency in Buildings\n* Guide G: Public Health Engineering\n* Guide H: Building Control Systems\n* Guide J: Weather, Solar and Illuminance Data\n* Guide K: Electricity in Buildings\n* Guide L: Sustainability\n* Guide M: Maintenance Engineering and Management\n\nWithin the [[construction]] sector, it is the job of the building services engineer to [[design]] and oversee the installation and maintenance of the essential services such as gas, [[electricity]], water, heating and [[lighting]], as well as many others. These all help to make buildings comfortable and healthy places to live and work in. Building Services is part of a sector that has over 51,000 businesses and employs represents 2%-3% of the [[GDP]].\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe Air Conditioning and Mechanical Contractors Association of Australia (AMCA), Australian Institute of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heating (AIRAH), Australian Refrigeration Mechanical Association and CIBSE are responsible.\n\n=== Asia ===\nAsian architectural temperature-control have different priorities than European methods. For example, Asian heating traditionally focuses on maintaining [[Underfloor heating#History|temperatures of objects such as the floor]] or furnishings such as [[Kotatsu]] tables and directly warming people, as opposed to the Western focus, in modern periods, on designing air systems.\n\n==== Philippines ====\nThe Philippine Society of Ventilating, Air Conditioning and Refrigerating Engineers (PSVARE) along with Philippine Society of Mechanical Engineers (PSME) govern on the codes and standards for HVAC / MVAC (MVAC means \"mechanical ventilation and air conditioning\") in the Philippines.\n\n====India====\nThe Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ISHRAE) was established to promote the HVAC industry in India. ISHRAE is an associate of ASHRAE. ISHRAE was started at [[Delhi]] in 1981 and a chapter was started in Bangalore in 1989.

Its goal is to provide [[thermal comfort]] and acceptable [[indoor air quality]]. HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of [[mechanical engineering]], based on the principles of [[thermodynamics]], [[fluid mechanics]] and [[heat transfer]]. \"[[Refrigeration]]\" is sometimes added to the field's abbreviation, as '''HVAC&R''' or '''HVACR''' or \"ventilation\" is dropped, as in '''HACR''' (as in the designation of HACR-rated [[circuit breaker]]s).\n\nHVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as [[skyscraper]]s and hospitals, vehicles such as cars, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and [[Sick building syndrome|healthy building]] conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.\n\nVentilating or [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] (the \"V\" in HVAC)  is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.\n\nVentilation includes both the exchange of air to the outside as well as circulation of air within the building. It is one of the most important factors for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality in buildings. Methods for ventilating a building may be divided into ''mechanical/forced'' and ''[[Natural ventilation|natural]]'' types.<ref>[https://www.ashrae.org/advertising/handbook-advertising/fundamentals/ventilation-and-infiltration Ventilation and Infiltration chapter], Fundamentals volume of the ''[[ASHRAE Handbook]]'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2005</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe three major functions of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning are interrelated, especially with the need to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality within reasonable installation, operation, and maintenance costs. HVAC systems can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. HVAC systems can provide ventilation, and maintain pressure relationships between spaces. The means of air delivery and removal from spaces is known as [[room air distribution]].<ref name=\"Rock and Zhu\">''Designer's Guide to Ceiling-Based Air Diffusion'', Rock and Zhu, [[ASHRAE]], Inc., [[New York (state)|New York]], 2002</ref>\n\n=== Individual systems ===\n{{See also|HVAC control system}}\n\nIn modern buildings, the design, installation, and [[HVAC control system|control systems]] of these functions are integrated into one or more HVAC systems. For very small buildings, contractors normally estimate the capacity and type of system needed and then design the system, selecting the appropriate refrigerant and various components needed. For larger buildings, building service designers, mechanical engineers, or [[Building engineering|building services]] engineers analyze, design, and specify the HVAC systems. Specialty mechanical contractors then fabricate and commission the systems. Building permits and code-compliance inspections of the installations are normally required for all sizes of building.\n\n=== District networks ===\nAlthough HVAC is executed in individual buildings or other enclosed spaces (like [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD's]] underground headquarters), the equipment involved is in some cases an extension of a larger [[district heating]] (DH) or [[district cooling]] (DC) network, or a combined DHC network. In such cases, the operating and maintenance aspects are simplified and metering becomes necessary to bill for the energy that is consumed, and in some cases energy that is returned to the larger system. For example, at a given time one building may be utilizing chilled water for air conditioning and the warm water it returns may be used in another building for heating, or for the overall heating-portion of the DHC network (likely with energy added to boost the temperature).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.04.020|title=District heating and cooling: Review of technology and potential enhancements|journal=Applied Energy|volume=93|pages=2\u201310|year=2012|last1=Rezaie|first1=Behnaz|last2=Rosen|first2=Marc A.}} </ref><ref>Werner S.

Coyne College was the first school to offer HVAC training in 1899.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Heating, Air Conditioning & Refrigeration|url=https://www.coynecollege.edu/programs/hvac|website=Coyne College}}</ref>\n\nThe invention of the components of HVAC systems went hand-in-hand with the [[industrial revolution]], and new methods of modernization, higher efficiency, and system control are constantly being introduced by companies and inventors worldwide.\n\n== Heating ==\n{{main|Central heating}}\n{{Redirect|Heater}}\nHeaters are appliances whose purpose is to generate heat (i.e. warmth) for the building. This can be done via [[central heating]]. Such a system contains a [[boiler]], [[furnace]], or [[heat pump]] to heat water, steam, or air in a central location such as a [[furnace room]] in a home, or a [[mechanical room]] in a large building. The heat can be transferred by [[convection]], conduction, or [[radiation]].\n\n=== Generation ===\n[[File:Panna.jpg|thumb|upright|Central heating unit]]\nHeaters exist for various types of fuel, including [[Fuel#Solid fuel|solid fuels]], [[Fuel#Liquid fuel|liquids]], and [[Fuel#Gaseous fuels|gases]]. Another type of heat source is [[Electric heating|electricity]], normally heating ribbons composed of high resistance wire (see [[Nichrome]]). This principle is also used for baseboard heaters and [[Space heater|portable heaters]]. Electrical heaters are often used as backup or supplemental heat for heat pump systems.\n\nThe heat pump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255759857 |title=A review of domestic heat pumps |author=Iain Staffell, Dan Brett, Nigel Brandon and Adam Hawkes |date=30 May 2014}}</ref> Heat pumps can extract heat from [[Heat pump#Heat sources and sinks|various sources]], such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air inside. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate climates, but with improvements in low temperature operation and reduced loads due to more efficient homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler climates.\n\n=== Distribution ===\n\n==== Water/steam ====\nIn the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the rooms. Most modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (as opposed to older [[Water heating#Gravity-fed system|gravity-fed systems]]). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using [[radiator (heating)|radiators]], hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.\n\nThe use of water as the heat transfer medium is known as [[hydronics]]. The heated water can also supply an auxiliary heat exchanger to supply hot water for bathing and washing.\n\n==== Air ====\nWarm air systems distribute heated air through duct work systems of supply and return air through metal or fiberglass ducts. Many systems use the same ducts to distribute air cooled by an evaporator coil for air conditioning. The air supply is normally filtered through air cleaners to remove dust and pollen particles.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Dangers ===\nThe use of furnaces, space heaters, and boilers as a method of indoor heating could result in incomplete combustion and the emission of [[carbon monoxide]], [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]], [[formaldehyde]], [[volatile organic compound]]s, and other combustion byproducts. Incomplete combustion occurs when there is insufficient oxygen; the inputs are fuels containing various contaminants and the outputs are harmful byproducts, most dangerously carbon monoxide, which is a tasteless and odorless gas with serious adverse health effects.<ref>{{cite book | last=Bearg | first=David W. | title=Indoor Air Quality and HVAC Systems | year=1993 | publisher=Lewis Publishers | location=New York | pages=107\u2013112}}</ref>\n\nWithout proper ventilation, carbon monoxide can be lethal at concentrations of 1000 ppm (0.1%). However, at several hundred ppm, carbon monoxide exposure induces headaches, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin in the blood, forming carboxyhemoglobin, reducing the blood's ability to transport oxygen. The primary health concerns associated with carbon monoxide exposure are its cardiovascular and neurobehavioral effects. Carbon monoxide can cause atherosclerosis (the hardening of arteries) and can also trigger heart attacks. Neurologically, carbon monoxide exposure reduces hand to eye coordination, vigilance, and continuous performance. It can also affect time discrimination.<ref>{{cite web | last=Dianat, Nazari | first=I,I | title=Characteristic of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning in Northwest Iran- Tabriz | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ | publisher=International Journal of Injury Control and Promotion | accessdate=2011-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Ventilation==\n{{Main|Ventilation (architecture)}}\nVentilation is the process of changing or replacing air in any space to control temperature or remove any combination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, or carbon dioxide, and to replenish oxygen. Ventilation includes both the exchange of air with the outside as well as circulation of air within the building. It is one of the most important factors for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality in buildings. Methods for ventilating a building may be divided into ''mechanical/forced'' and ''natural'' types.<ref>Ventilation and Infiltration chapter, Fundamentals volume of the ''ASHRAE Handbook'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia, 2005</ref>\n\n=== Mechanical or forced ventilation ===\n[[File:HVAC Ventilation Exhaust.jpg|thumb|HVAC ventilation exhaust for a 12-story building]]\nMechanical, or forced, ventilation is provided by an [[air handler]] (AHU) and used to control indoor air quality. Excess [[humidity]], odors, and contaminants can often be controlled via dilution or replacement with outside air. However, in humid climates more energy is required to remove excess moisture from ventilation air.\n\nKitchens and bathrooms typically have mechanical exhausts to control odors and sometimes humidity. Factors in the design of such systems include the flow rate (which is a function of the fan speed and exhaust vent size) and noise level. [[Direct drive mechanism|Direct drive]] fans are available for many applications, and can reduce maintenance needs.\n\nCeiling [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]] and table/floor fans circulate air within a room for the purpose of reducing the perceived temperature by increasing evaporation of perspiration on the skin of the occupants. Because hot air rises, ceiling fans may be used to keep a room warmer in the winter by circulating the warm stratified air from the ceiling to the floor.\n\n=== Natural ventilation ===\n[[File:N&AMOV - Schoolroom - Impulsion.png|thumb|Ventilation on the [[downdraught]] system, by impulsion, or the [[Plenum space|'plenum' principle]], applied to schoolrooms (1899)]]\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Chimney]] -->\nNatural ventilation is the ventilation of a building with outside air without using fans or other mechanical systems. It can be via operable windows, louvers, or [[trickle vent]]s when spaces are small and the architecture permits. In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to rise and flow out high building openings to the outside ([[stack effect]]), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use very little energy, but care must be taken to ensure comfort. In warm or humid climates, maintaining thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation might not be possible. [[Air conditioning]] systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side [[Economizer#HVAC|economizers]] also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.\n\nAn important component of natural ventilation is air change rate or [[air changes per hour]]: the hourly rate of ventilation divided by the volume of the space. For example, six air changes per hour means an amount of new air, equal to the volume of the space, is added every ten minutes. For human comfort, a minimum of four air changes per hour is typical, though warehouses might have only two. Too high of an air change rate may be uncomfortable, akin to a [[wind tunnel]] which have thousands of changes per hour. The highest air change rates are for crowded spaces, bars, night clubs, commercial kitchens at around 30 to 50 air changes per hour.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-change-rate-room-d_867.html\n | title = Air Change Rates for typical Rooms and Buildings\n | publisher = The Engineering ToolBox\n | accessdate = 2012-12-12\n}}</ref>\n\nRoom pressure can be either positive or negative with respect to outside the room. Positive pressure occurs when there is more air being supplied than exhausted, and is common to reduce the infiltration of outside contaminants.<ref>{{cite web | last=Bell | first=Geoffrey | title=Room Air Change Rate | url=http://ateam.lbl.gov/Design-Guide/DGHtm/roomairchangerates.htm | publisher=A Design Guide for Energy-Efficient Research Laboratories | accessdate=2011-11-15}}</ref>\n\n====Airborne diseases====\nNatural ventilation is a key factor in reducing the spread of airborne illnesses such as tuberculosis, the common cold, influenza and meningitis. Opening doors, windows, and using ceiling fans are all ways to maximize natural ventilation and reduce the risk of airborne contagion. Natural ventilation requires little maintenance and is inexpensive.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Escombe |first=A. R. |last2=Oeser |first2=C. C. |last3=Gilman |first3=R.

Air conditioned buildings often have sealed windows, because open windows would work against the system intended to maintain constant indoor air conditions. Outside, fresh air is generally drawn into the system by a vent into the indoor heat exchanger section, creating positive air pressure. The percentage of return air made up of fresh air can usually be manipulated by adjusting the opening of this vent. Typical fresh air intake is about 10%.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAir conditioning and refrigeration are provided through the removal of heat. Heat can be removed through [[thermal radiation|radiation]], convection, or [[Thermal conduction|conduction]]. Refrigeration conduction media such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as [[refrigerant]]s. A refrigerant is employed either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is used to drive thermodynamic [[refrigeration cycle]], or in a free cooling system which uses pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (typically water or a glycol mix).\n\nIt is imperative that the air conditioning horsepower is sufficient for the area being cooled. Underpowered air conditioning system will lead to power wastage and inefficient usage. Adequate horsepower is required for any air conditioner installed.\n\n=== Refrigeration cycle ===\n{{main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}\n[[File:Heatpump.svg|thumb|A simple stylized diagram of the refrigeration cycle: 1)&nbsp;[[condensing coil]], 2)&nbsp;[[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], 3)&nbsp;[[evaporator coil]], 4)&nbsp;[[Gas compressor|compressor]]]]\nThe refrigeration cycle uses four essential elements to cool.\n* The system refrigerant starts its cycle in a gaseous state. The '''compressor''' pumps the refrigerant gas up to a high pressure and temperature.\n* From there it enters a heat exchanger (sometimes called a '''condensing coil''' or condenser) where it loses energy (heat) to the outside, cools, and condenses into its liquid phase.\n* An '''[[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]]''' (also called metering device) regulates the refrigerant liquid to flow at the proper rate.\n* The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an '''evaporating coil''' or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs energy (heat) from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.\n\nIn variable climates, the system may include a [[reversing valve]] that switches from heating in winter to cooling in summer. By reversing the flow of refrigerant, the heat pump refrigeration cycle is changed from cooling to heating or vice versa. This allows a facility to be heated and cooled by a single piece of equipment by the same means, and with the same hardware.\n\n=== Free cooling ===\n{{main|Free cooling}}\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a [[heat sink]] when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.\n\nSome systems include an \"economizer mode\", which is sometimes called a \"free-cooling mode\". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion \"DX\" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the [[enthalpy]] of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.\n\n===Packaged vs. split system===\nCentral, \"all-air\" air-conditioning systems (or package systems) with a combined outdoor condenser/evaporator unit are often installed in North American residences, offices, and public buildings, but are difficult to retrofit (install in a building that was not designed to receive it) because of the bulky air ducts required. (Minisplit ductless systems are used in these situations.) Outside of North America, packaged systems are only used in limited applications involving large indoor space such as stadiums, theatres or exhibition halls.\n\nAn alternative to packaged systems is the use of separate indoor and outdoor coils in [[Split-system air conditioner|split systems]]. Split systems are preferred and widely used worldwide except in North America. In North America, split systems are most often seen in residential applications, but they are gaining popularity in small commercial buildings.\nThe split systems are a great choice for small buildings where ductwork is not feasible or where the space conditioning efficiency is of prime concern.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-systems/ductless-mini-split-heat-pumps|title=Ductless, Mini-Split Heat Pumps|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref> The benefits of ductless air conditioning systems include easy installation, no ductwork, greater zonal control, flexibility of control and quiet operation.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} In space conditioning, the duct losses can account for 30% of energy consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners|title=Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=29 November 2019}}</ref> The use of minisplit can result in energy savings in space conditioning as there are no losses associated with ducting.\n\nWith the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.\n\nSplit systems are more efficient and the footprint is typically smaller than the package systems. On the other hand, package systems tend to have slightly lower indoor noise level compared to split system since the fan motor is located outside.\n\n=== Dehumidification ===\nDehumidification (air drying) in an air conditioning system is provided by the evaporator. Since the evaporator operates at a temperature below the [[dew point]], moisture in the air condenses on the evaporator coil tubes. This moisture is collected at the bottom of the evaporator in a pan and removed by piping to a central drain or onto the ground outside.\n\nA [[dehumidifier]] is an air-conditioner-like device that controls the humidity of a room or building. It is often employed in basements which have a higher [[relative humidity]] because of their lower temperature (and propensity for damp floors and walls). In food retailing establishments, large open chiller cabinets are highly effective at dehumidifying the internal air. Conversely, a humidifier increases the humidity of a building.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nAll modern air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.\n\nBecause an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.\n\n==Energy efficiency==\nSince the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more efficient. This was originally driven by rising energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues. Additionally, improvements to the HVAC system efficiency can also help increase occupant health and productivity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sustainable Facilities Tool: HVAC System Overview|url=https://sftool.gov/explore/green-building/section/9/hvac/system-overview|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> In the US, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] has imposed tighter restrictions over the years. There are several methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.\n\n===Heating energy===\nIn the past, water heating was more efficient for heating buildings and was the standard in the United States. Today, [[forced air]] systems can double for air conditioning and are more popular.\n\nSome benefits of forced air systems, which are now widely used in churches, schools and high-end residences, are\n* Better air conditioning effects\n* Energy savings of up to 15-20%\n* Even conditioning{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\nA drawback is the installation cost, which can be slightly higher than traditional HVAC systems.\n\nEnergy efficiency can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control [[zone valve]]s, and in forced air systems they control [[zone damper]]s inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very critical to maintaining a proper temperature.\n\n[[Forecasting (heating)|Forecasting]] is another method of controlling building heating by calculating demand for heating energy that should be supplied to the building in each time unit.\n\n===Ground source heat pump===\n{{Main|Geothermal heat pump}}\nGround source, or geothermal, heat pumps are similar to ordinary heat pumps, but instead of transferring heat to or from outside air, they rely on the stable, even temperature of the earth to provide heating and air conditioning. Many regions experience seasonal temperature extremes, which would require large-capacity heating and cooling equipment to heat or cool buildings. For example, a conventional heat pump system used to heat a building in Montana's {{convert|-70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|lk=on}} low temperature or cool a building in the highest temperature ever recorded in the US\u2014{{convert|134|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in [[Death Valley]], California, in 1913 would require a large amount of energy due to the extreme difference between inside and outside air temperatures. A few feet below the earth's surface, however, the ground remains at a relatively constant temperature. Utilizing this large source of relatively moderate temperature earth, a heating or cooling system's capacity can often be significantly reduced. Although ground temperatures vary according to latitude, at {{convert|6|ft|m}} underground, temperatures generally only range from {{convert|45|to|75|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.\n\nAn example of a geothermal heat pump that uses a body of water as the heat sink, is the system used by the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] in Chicago, Illinois. This building is situated on the [[Chicago River]], and uses cold river water by pumping it into a recirculating cooling system, where heat exchangers transfer heat from the building into the water, and then the now-warmed water is pumped back into the Chicago River.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nWhile they may be more costly to install than regular heat pumps, geothermal heat pumps can produce markedly lower energy bills \u2013 30 to 40 percent lower, according to estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nGeothermal heat pumps still provide higher efficiency than air source heat pumps. Some models provide 70% saving compared to electric resistance heaters.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Ventilation energy recovery===\n[[Energy recovery]] systems sometimes utilize [[heat recovery ventilation]] or [[energy recovery ventilation]] systems that employ [[heat exchanger]]s or [[thermal wheel|enthalpy wheels]] to recover [[sensible heat|sensible]] or [[latent heat]] from exhausted air. This is done by transfer of energy to the incoming outside fresh air.\n\n===Air conditioning energy===\nThe performance of vapor compression refrigeration cycles is limited by [[Second law of thermodynamics|thermodynamics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-engineering/thermodynamics/thermodynamic-cycles/heating-and-air-conditioning/#Vapor-compression_Cycle_8211_Vapor-compression_Refrigeration|title=Heating and Air Conditioning|website=www.nuclear-power.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-10}}</ref> These air conditioning and heat pump devices ''move'' heat rather than convert it from one form to another, so ''[[Thermal efficiency|thermal efficiencies]]'' do not appropriately describe the performance of these devices. The Coefficient-of-Performance (COP) measures performance, but this dimensionless measure has not been adopted. Instead, the Energy Efficiency Ratio (''EER'') has traditionally been used to characterize the performance of many HVAC systems. EER is the Energy Efficiency Ratio based on a {{convert|35|C|F}} outdoor temperature. To more accurately describe the performance of air conditioning equipment over a typical cooling season a modified version of the EER, the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (''SEER''), or in Europe the [[ESEER]], is used. SEER ratings are based on seasonal temperature averages instead of a constant {{convert|35|\u00b0C}} outdoor temperature. The current industry minimum SEER rating is 14 SEER.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airrepairpros.com/what-does-seer-stand-for|title=What Does SEER Stand For?|website=www.airrepairpros.com|language=en-US|access-date=2015-09-07|date=2015-09-07}}</ref>\nEngineers have pointed out some areas where efficiency of the existing hardware could be improved. For example, the fan blades used to move the air are usually stamped from sheet metal, an economical method of manufacture, but as a result they are not aerodynamically efficient. A well-designed blade could reduce electrical power required to move the air by a third.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2010/07/15/keeping-cool-and-green Keeping cool and green], ''[[The Economist]]'' 17 July 2010, p. 83</ref>\n\n=== Demand controlled kitchen ventilation ===\n{{main|Demand controlled ventilation}}\nDemand controlled kitchen ventilation (DCKV) is a building controls approach of controlling the volume of kitchen exhaust and supply air in response to the actual cooking loads in a commercial kitchen. Traditional commercial kitchen ventilation systems operate at 100% fan speed independent of the volume of cooking activity and DCKV technology changes that to provide significant fan energy and conditioned air savings. By deploying smart sensing technology, both the exhaust and supply fans can be controlled to capitalize on the [[affinity laws]] for motor energy savings, reduce makeup air heating and cooling energy, increasing safety and reducing ambient kitchen noise levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/dckv_technology_profile.pdf|title=Technology Profile: Demand Control Kitchen Ventilation (DCKV)|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==Air filtration and cleaning==\n{{Main|Air filter}}\n[[File:Air handling unit.JPG|thumb|[[Air handling unit]], used for heating, cooling, and filtering the air]]\nAir cleaning and filtration removes particles, contaminants, vapors and gases from the air. The filtered and cleaned air then is used in heating, ventilation and air conditioning.

When determining CADR, the amount of airflow in a space is taken into account. For example, an air cleaner with a flow rate of 100 cfm (cubic feet per minute) and an efficiency of 50% has a CADR of 50 cfm. Along with CADR, filtration performance is very important when it comes to the air in our indoor environment. Filter performance depends on the size of the particle or fiber, the filter packing density and depth and also the air flow rate.<ref name=\"Howard 2003 1\u201363\"/>\n\n== HVAC industry and standards ==\nThe HVAC industry is a worldwide enterprise, with roles including operation and maintenance, system design and construction, equipment manufacturing and sales, and in education and research. The HVAC industry was historically regulated by the manufacturers of HVAC equipment, but regulating and standards organizations such as HARDI, [[ASHRAE]], [[SMACNA]], [[Air Conditioning Contractors of America|ACCA]], [[Uniform Mechanical Code]], [[International Building Code|International Mechanical Code]], and [[Air Movement and Controls Association|AMCA]] have been established to support the industry and encourage high standards and achievement.\n\nThe starting point in carrying out an estimate both for cooling and heating depends on the exterior climate and interior specified conditions. However, before taking up the heat load calculation, it is necessary to find fresh air requirements for each area in detail, as [[pressurization]] is an important consideration.\n\n=== International ===\n[[ISO 16813]]:2006 is one of the  [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] building environment standards.<ref>{{cite web|last=ISO|title=Building environment standards|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=54740|publisher=www.iso.org|accessdate=2011-05-14}}</ref> It establishes the general principles of building environment design.

ASHRAE is an international technical society for all individuals and organizations interested in HVAC. The Society, organized into regions, chapters, and student branches, allows exchange of HVAC knowledge and experiences for the benefit of the field's practitioners and the public. ASHRAE provides many opportunities to participate in the development of new knowledge via, for example, research and its many technical committees. These committees typically meet twice per year at the ASHRAE Annual and Winter Meetings. A popular product show, the AHR Expo, is held in conjunction with each winter meeting. The Society has approximately 50,000 members and has headquarters in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\nThe most recognized standards for HVAC design are based on ASHRAE data. The most general of four volumes of the ASHRAE Handbook is Fundamentals; it includes heating and cooling calculations. Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The design professional must consult ASHRAE data for the standards of design and care as the typical building codes provide little to no information on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do include much detail on installation requirements, however. Other useful reference materials include items from [[SMACNA]], [[ACGIH]], and technical trade journals.\n\nAmerican design standards are legislated in the Uniform Mechanical Code or International Mechanical Code. In certain states, counties, or cities, either of these codes may be adopted and amended via various legislative processes. These codes are updated and published by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials ([[IAPMO]]) or the International Code Council ([[International Code Council|ICC]]) respectively, on a 3-year code development cycle. Typically, local building permit departments are charged with enforcement of these standards on private and certain public properties.\n\nHVAC professionals in the US can receive training through formal training institutions, where most earn [[associate degree]]s. Training for HVAC technicians includes classroom lectures and hands-on tasks, and can be followed by an apprenticeship wherein the recent graduate works alongside a professional HVAC technician for a temporary period.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} HVAC techs who have been trained can also be certified in areas such as air conditioning, heat pumps, gas heating, and commercial refrigeration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.natex.org/technicians/certification-basics101/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006052206/http://www.natex.org/technicians/certification-basics101/ |archive-date=2011-10-06 |title=Certification basics/101 |publisher=NATE |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nThe [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] is a body that covers the essential [[Service (systems architecture)]] that allow buildings to operate.

To [[train]] as a [[Building services engineering|building services engineer]], the [[academic]] requirements are GCSEs (A-C) / Standard Grades (1-3) in Maths and Science, which are important in measurements, planning and theory. Employers will often want a [[academic degree|degree]] in a branch of engineering, such as building environment [[engineering]], electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. To become a full member of CIBSE, and so also to be registered by the [[Engineering Council UK]] as a chartered engineer, engineers must also attain an Honours Degree and a master's degree in a relevant engineering subject.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\nCIBSE publishes several guides to HVAC design relevant to the UK market, and also the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. These guides include various recommended design criteria and standards, some of which are cited within the UK building regulations, and therefore form a legislative requirement for major building services works. The main guides are:\n* Guide A: Environmental Design\n* Guide B: Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration\n* Guide C: Reference Data\n* Guide D: Transportation systems in Buildings\n* Guide E: Fire Safety Engineering\n* Guide F: Energy Efficiency in Buildings\n* Guide G: Public Health Engineering\n* Guide H: Building Control Systems\n* Guide J: Weather, Solar and Illuminance Data\n* Guide K: Electricity in Buildings\n* Guide L: Sustainability\n* Guide M: Maintenance Engineering and Management\n\nWithin the [[construction]] sector, it is the job of the building services engineer to [[design]] and oversee the installation and maintenance of the essential services such as gas, [[electricity]], water, heating and [[lighting]], as well as many others. These all help to make buildings comfortable and healthy places to live and work in. Building Services is part of a sector that has over 51,000 businesses and employs represents 2%-3% of the [[GDP]].\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe Air Conditioning and Mechanical Contractors Association of Australia (AMCA), Australian Institute of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heating (AIRAH), Australian Refrigeration Mechanical Association and CIBSE are responsible.\n\n=== Asia ===\nAsian architectural temperature-control have different priorities than European methods.
