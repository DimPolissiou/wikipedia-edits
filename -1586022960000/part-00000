During the medieval period, means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from [[cast iron]] (in this context known as [[pig iron]]) using [[finery forge]]s. For all these processes, [[charcoal]] was required as [[fuel]].\n\n[[Steel]] (with a carbon content between pig iron and wrought iron) was first produced in antiquity as an alloy. Its process of production, [[Wootz steel]], was exported before the 4th century BC from India to ancient China, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Archaeological evidence of [[cast iron]] appears in 5th-century BC China.<ref name=\"Wagner\" /> New methods of producing it by [[carburizing]] bars of iron in the [[cementation process]] were devised in the 17th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], new methods of producing bar iron by substituting [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel, creating a new era of greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age.<ref name=\"Williams1867IronAge\">{{Citation |last=Williams |first=David |year=1867 |title=The Iron Age [weekly journal] |publisher=David Williams |location=New York |oclc=5257259 |lccn=sc82008005 |issn=0021-1508 |postscript=.}}</ref> In the late 1850s, [[Henry Bessemer]] invented a [[Bessemer process|new steelmaking process]], that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off carbon, and so to produce mild steel.  This and other 19th-century and later steel making processes have displaced [[wrought iron]]. Today, wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale, having been displaced by the functionally equivalent mild or low carbon steel.<ref name=Tylecote/>{{rp|145}}\n\nThe largest and most modern underground [[iron ore]] mine in the world is located in [[Kiruna]], [[Norrbotten County]], [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]].<ref name=\"Kiruna\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mining-technology.com/projects/kiruna/|title=Kiruna Iron Ore Mine, Sweden|year=2010|publisher=mining-technology.com|accessdate=2010-08-29|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529230017/http://www.mining-technology.com/projects/kiruna/|archive-date=2010-05-29|df=}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}</ref> The mine which is owned by [[LKAB|Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB]], a large Swedish mining company, has an annual production capacity of over 26 million tonnes of [[iron ore]].\n\n== Meteoritic iron ==\n{{Main|Meteoritic iron}}\n[[File:Willamette Meteorite AMNH.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willamette Meteorite]], the sixth largest in the world, is an [[iron-nickel meteorite]].]]\n[[File:Widmanstatten IronMet.JPG|thumb|Iron meteorites consist overwhelmingly of nickel-iron alloys. The metal taken from these meteorites is known as meteoritic iron and was one of the earliest sources of usable iron available to humans.]]\n\nIron was extracted from [[iron\u2013nickel alloy]]s, which comprise about 6% of all [[meteorite fall|meteorites that fall]] on the [[Earth]]. That source can often be identified with certainty because of the unique [[crystal]]line features ([[Widmanst\u00e4tten pattern]]s) of that material, which are preserved when the metal is worked cold or at low temperature.  Those artifacts include, for example, a [[bead]] from the 5th millennium BC found in [[Iran]]<ref name=ephotos /> and spear tips and ornaments from [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Sumer]] around 4000 BC.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\">R. F. Tylecote, ''A History of Metallurgy'' (2nd edn, 1992), 3</ref>\n\nThese early uses appear to have been largely ceremonial or ornamental. Meteoritic iron is very rare, and the metal was probably very expensive, perhaps more expensive than [[gold]]. The early [[Hittites]] are known to have [[barter]]ed iron (meteoritic or smelted) for [[silver]], at a rate of 40 times the iron's weight, with the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] in the first centuries of the [[2nd millennium BC|second millennium BC]].<ref name=Veenhof>{{cite book|last1=Veenhof|first1=Klaas |authorlink1=Klaas Veenhof|last2=Eidem|first2=Jesper|authorlink2=Jesper Eidem|title=Mesopotamia : Ann\u00e4herungen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYMmrenUywQC&pg=PA84|year=2008|publisher=Saint-Paul|isbn=978-3-525-53452-6|pages=84}}</ref>\n\nMeteoric iron was also fashioned into tools in the [[Arctic]], about the year 1000, when the [[Thule people]] of [[Greenland]] began making [[harpoon]]s, knives, [[ulu]]s and other edged tools from pieces of the [[Cape York meteorite]]. Typically pea-size bits of metal were cold-hammered into disks and fitted to a bone handle.<ref name=ephotos /> These artifacts were also used as trade goods with other Arctic peoples: tools made from the Cape York meteorite have been found in archaeological sites more than {{convert|1000|miles}} distant. When the [[United States|American]] polar explorer [[Robert Peary]] shipped the largest piece of the meteorite to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]] in 1897, it still weighed over 33&nbsp;[[ton]]s.  Another example of a late use of meteoritic iron is an [[adze]] from around 1000 AD found in [[Sweden]].<ref name=ephotos />\n\n== Native iron ==\n{{Main|Telluric iron}}\n[[Native metal|Native]] iron in the metallic state occurs rarely as small inclusions in certain [[basalt]] rocks.  Besides meteoritic iron, Thule people of Greenland have used native iron from the [[Disko Island|Disko]] region.<ref name=ephotos />\n\n== Iron smelting and the Iron Age ==\nIron smelting\u2014the extraction of usable metal from [[oxidation|oxidized]] iron ores\u2014is more difficult than [[tin]] and [[copper]] smelting. While these metals and their alloys can be cold-worked or melted in relatively simple furnaces (such as the kilns used for [[pottery]]) and cast into molds, smelted iron requires hot-working and can be melted only in specially designed furnaces. Iron is a common impurity in copper ores and iron ore was sometimes used as a [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]], thus it is not surprising that humans mastered the technology of smelted iron only after several millennia of [[bronze|bronze metallurgy]].<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>\n\nThe place and time for the discovery of iron smelting is not known, partly because of the difficulty of distinguishing metal extracted from nickel-containing ores from hot-worked meteoritic iron.<ref name=ephotos />  The archaeological evidence seems to point to the Middle East area, during the [[Bronze Age]] in the 3rd millennium BC. However, [[wrought iron]] artifacts remained a rarity until the 12th century BC.\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] is conventionally defined by the widespread replacement of [[bronze]] weapons and tools with those of iron and steel.<ref name=waldbaum>Waldbaum, Jane C.

Mesopotamia was fully into the Iron Age by 900 BC.  Although Egypt produced iron artifacts, bronze remained dominant until its conquest by Assyria in 663 BC.

As the technology spread, iron came to replace bronze as the dominant metal used for tools and weapons across the Eastern Mediterranean (the [[Levant]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]], [[Crete]], Anatolia and Egypt).<ref name=waldbaum />\n\nIron was originally smelted in [[bloomery|bloomeries]], furnaces where [[bellows]] were used to force air through a pile of iron ore and burning [[charcoal]]. The [[carbon monoxide]] produced by the charcoal reduced the [[iron oxide]] from the ore to metallic iron. The bloomery, however, was not hot enough to melt the iron, so the metal collected in the bottom of the furnace as a spongy mass, or ''bloom''. Workers then repeatedly beat and folded it to force out the molten slag. This laborious, time-consuming process produced [[wrought iron]], a malleable but fairly soft alloy.\n\nConcurrent with the transition from bronze to iron was the discovery of [[carburization]], the process of adding carbon to wrought iron. While the iron bloom contained some carbon, the subsequent hot-working [[oxidation|oxidized]] most of it. Smiths in the Middle East discovered that wrought iron could be turned into a much harder product by heating the finished piece in a bed of charcoal, and then [[quench]]ing it in water or oil. This procedure turned the outer layers of the piece into [[steel]], an alloy of iron and [[iron carbide]]s, with an inner core of less brittle iron.\n\n==== Theories on the origin of iron smelting ====\nThe development of iron smelting was traditionally attributed to the [[Hittites]] of Anatolia of the Late [[Bronze Age]].<ref name=mulhy>Muhly, James D. 'Metalworking/Mining in the Levant' pp. 174-183 in ''Near Eastern Archaeology'' ed. Suzanne Richard (2003), pp. 179-180.</ref> It was believed that they maintained a monopoly on iron working, and that their empire had been based on that advantage. According to that theory, the ancient [[Sea Peoples]], who invaded the Eastern Mediterranean and destroyed the Hittite empire at the end of the Late Bronze Age, were responsible for spreading the knowledge through that region. This theory is no longer held in the mainstream of scholarship,<ref name=mulhy /> since there is no archaeological evidence of the alleged Hittite monopoly. While there are some iron objects from Bronze Age Anatolia, the number is comparable to iron objects found in Egypt and other places of the same time period, and only a small number of those objects were weapons.<ref name=\"Waldbaum 1978: 23\" />\n\nA more recent theory claims that the development of iron technology was driven by the disruption of the [[copper]] and [[tin]] trade routes, due to the collapse of the empires at the end of the Late Bronze Age.<ref name=mulhy />  These metals, especially tin, were not widely available and metal workers had to transport them over long distances, whereas iron ores were widely available. However, no known archaeological evidence suggests a shortage of bronze or tin in the Early Iron Age.<ref>Muhly 2003:180.</ref>  Bronze objects remained abundant, and these objects have the same percentage of tin as those from the Late Bronze Age.\n\n=== Indian Sub-Continent ===\n[[File:QtubIronPillar.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Iron pillar of Delhi]]]]\nThe history of ferrous metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent began in the 2nd millennium BC.

European metal workers continued to produce iron in bloomeries.  However, the [[Medieval]] period brought two developments\u2014the use of water power in the bloomery process in various places (outlined above), and the first European production in cast iron.\n\n=== Powered bloomeries ===\n{{Main|Bloomery}}\nSometime in the medieval period, water power was applied to the bloomery process.  It is possible that this was at the [[Cistercian]] Abbey of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]] as early as 1135, but it was certainly in use in early 13th century [[France]] and Sweden.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lucas | first1 = A.

In the [[Furness]] district of England, powered bloomeries were in use into the beginning of the 18th century, and near [[Garstang]] until about 1770.\n\nThe Catalan Forge was a variety of powered bloomery.  Bloomeries with [[hot blast]] were used in upstate [[New York State|New York]] in the mid-19th century.\n\n=== Blast furnace ===\n[[File:Iron-Making.jpg|thumb|350|right|Ironmaking described in \"[[The Popular Encyclopedia; or, Conversations Lexicon|The Popular Encyclopedia]]\" vol.VII, published 1894]]\n{{Main|blast furnace}}\nThe preferred method of iron production in Europe until the development of the [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] in 1783\u201384. Cast iron development lagged in Europe because wrought iron was the desired product and the intermediate step of producing cast iron involved an expensive blast furnace and further refining of pig iron to cast iron, which then required a labor and capital intensive conversion to wrought iron.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}</ref>\n\nThrough a good portion of the Middle Ages, in Western Europe, iron was still being made by the working of iron blooms into wrought iron. Some of the earliest casting of iron in Europe occurred in Sweden, in two sites, [[Lapphyttan]] and Vinarhyttan, between 1150 and 1350. Some scholars have speculated the practice followed the [[Mongol]]s across [[Russia]] to these sites, but there is no clear proof of this hypothesis, and it would certainly not explain the pre-Mongol datings of many of these iron-production centres. In any event, by the late 14th century, a market for cast iron goods began to form, as a demand developed for cast iron cannonballs.\n\n=== Finery forge ===\n{{Main|Finery forge}}\nAn alternative method of [[decarburization|decarburising]] [[pig iron]] was the [[finery forge]], which seems to have been devised in the region around [[Namur (city)|Namur]] in the 15th century.  By the end of that century, this [[Wallonia|Walloon]] process spread  to the ''Pay de Bray'' on the eastern boundary of [[Normandy]], and then to England, where it became the main method of making wrought iron by 1600.  It was introduced to Sweden by [[Louis De Geer (1587\u20131652)|Louis de Geer]] in the early 17th century and was used to make the [[oregrounds iron]] favoured by English steelmakers.\n\nA variation on this was the [[Finery forge#German forge|German forge]].  This became the main method of producing [[bar iron]] in Sweden.\n\n=== Cementation process ===\n{{Main|Cementation process}}\nIn the early 17th century, ironworkers in [[Western Europe]] had developed the [[cementation process]] for [[carburization|carburizing]] [[wrought iron]]. Wrought iron bars and charcoal were packed into stone boxes, then sealed with clay to be held at a red heat continually tended in an oxygen-free state immersed in nearly pure carbon (charcoal) for up to a week.  During this time, carbon diffused into the surface layers of the iron, producing ''cement steel'' or ''blister steel''&mdash;also known as case hardened, where the portions wrapped in iron (the pick or axe blade) became harder, than say an axe hammer-head or shaft socket which might be insulated by clay to keep them from the carbon source.  The earliest place where this process was used in England was at [[Coalbrookdale]] from 1619, where Sir Basil Brooke had two cementation furnaces (recently excavated <!-- {{when|date=October 2016}} --->in 2001&ndash;2005<ref>Belford and Ross, Paper: [https://www.academia.edu/175895/English_steelmaking_in_the_seventeenth_century_the_excavation_of_two_cementation_furnaces_at_Coalbrookdale English steelmaking in the seventeenth century: the excavation of two cementation furnaces at Coalbrookdale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510201753/http://www.academia.edu/175895/English_steelmaking_in_the_seventeenth_century_the_excavation_of_two_cementation_furnaces_at_Coalbrookdale |date=2018-05-10 }}, Academia.edu, accessdate=30 March 2017</ref>).  For a time in the 1610s, he owned a patent on the process, but had to surrender this in 1619.  He probably used [[Forest of Dean]] iron as his raw material, but it was soon found that oregrounds iron was more suitable.  The quality of the steel could be improved by [[faggoting (metalworking)|faggoting]], producing the so-called shear steel.\n\n=== Crucible steel ===\nIn the 1740s, [[Benjamin Huntsman]] found a means of melting blister steel, made by the cementation process, in crucibles.  The resulting  [[crucible steel]], usually cast in ingots, was more homogeneous than blister steel.<ref name=Tylecote>{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.

By the 18th century, the availability of wood for making charcoal was limiting the expansion of iron production, so that England became increasingly dependent for a considerable part of the iron required by its industry, on Sweden (from the mid-17th century) and then from about 1725 also on Russia.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSmelting with coal (or its derivative [[coke (fuel)|coke]]) was a long sought objective.  The production of pig iron with coke was probably achieved by [[Dud Dudley]] in the 1620s, and with a mixed fuel made from coal and wood again in the 1670s.  However this was probably only a technological rather than a commercial success.  [[Shadrach Fox]] may have smelted iron with coke at Coalbrookdale in [[Shropshire]] in the 1690s, but only to make cannonballs and other cast iron products such as shells.  However, in the peace after the [[Nine Years War]], there was no demand for these.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = P.

His pots were thinner and hence cheaper than those of his rivals.   Needing a larger supply of pig iron he leased the blast furnace at Coalbrookdale in 1709.  There, he made iron using coke, thus establishing the first successful business in Europe to do so.  His products were all of cast iron, though his immediate successors attempted (with little commercial success) to fine this to bar iron.<ref>A. Raistrick, ''A dynasty of Ironfounders'' (1953; 1989); N. Cox, 'Imagination and innovation of an industrial pioneer: The first Abraham Darby' ''Industrial Archaeology Review'' 12(2) (1990), 127-144.</ref>\n\n[[Wrought iron|Bar iron]] thus continued normally to be made with charcoal pig iron until the mid-1750s.  In 1755 [[Abraham Darby II]] (with partners) opened a new coke-using furnace at [[Horsehay]] in Shropshire, and this was followed by others.  These supplied coke pig iron to finery forges of the traditional kind for the production of [[wrought iron|bar iron]].  The reason for the delay remains controversial.<ref>A. Raistrick, ''Dynasty''; C. K. Hyde, ''Technological change and the British iron industry 1700\u20131870'' (Princeton, 1977), 37-41; P. W. King, 'The Iron Trade in England and Wales 1500\u20131815' (Ph.D. thesis, Wolverhampton University, 2003), 128-41.</ref>\n\n=== New forge processes ===\n[[File:Puddling furnace.jpg|thumb|Schematic drawing of a puddling furnace]]\nIt was only after this that economically viable means of converting pig iron to bar iron began to be devised.  A process known as [[potting and stamping]] was devised in the 1760s and improved in the 1770s, and seems to have been widely adopted in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] from about 1785. However, this was largely replaced by [[Henry Cort]]'s puddling process, patented in 1784, but probably only made to work with grey pig iron in about 1790. These processes permitted the great expansion in the production of iron that constitutes the Industrial Revolution for the iron industry.<ref>G. R. Morton and N. Mutton, 'The transition to Cort's puddling process' ''Journal of Iron and Steel Institute'' 205(7) (1967), 722-8; R. A. Mott (ed. P. Singer), ''Henry Cort: The great finer: creator of puddled iron'' (1983); P. W. King, 'Iron Trade', 185-93.</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, Hall discovered that the addition of iron oxide to the charge of the puddling furnace caused a violent reaction, in which the pig iron was [[decarburization|decarburised]], this became known as 'wet puddling'. It was also found possible to produce steel by stopping the [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] before decarburisation was complete.\n\n== Hot blast ==\n{{Main|Hot blast}}\n\nThe efficiency of the blast furnace was improved by the change to [[hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in Scotland in 1828.  This further reduced production costs.  Within a few decades, the practice was to have a 'stove' as large as the furnace next to it into which the waste gas (containing CO) from the furnace was directed and burnt.  The resultant heat was used to preheat the air blown into the furnace.<ref>A. Birch, ''Economic History of the British Iron and Steel Industry'' , 181-9; C. K. Hyde, ''Technological Change and the British iron industry'' (Princeton 1977), 146-59.</ref>\n\n== Industrial steelmaking ==\n{{Main|Steelmaking}}\n[[File:Bessemer converter.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic drawing of a Bessemer converter]]\n\nApart from some production of puddled steel, English steel continued to be made by the cementation process, sometimes followed by remelting to produce crucible steel.  These were batch-based processes whose raw material was bar iron, particularly Swedish oregrounds iron.\n\nThe problem of mass-producing cheap steel was solved in 1855 by Henry Bessemer, with the introduction of the [[Bessemer process|Bessemer converter]] at his steelworks in [[Sheffield]], England. (An early converter can still be seen at the city's [[Kelham Island Museum]]). In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron from the blast furnace was charged into a large crucible, and then air was blown through the molten iron from below, igniting the dissolved carbon from the coke. As the carbon burned off, the melting point of the mixture increased, but the heat from the burning carbon provided the extra energy needed to keep the mixture molten. After the carbon content in the melt had dropped to the desired level, the air draft was cut off: a typical Bessemer converter could convert a 25-ton batch of pig iron to steel in half an hour.\n\nFinally, the [[Basic oxygen steelmaking|basic oxygen process]] was introduced at the Voest-Alpine works in 1952; a modification of the basic Bessemer process, it lances oxygen from above the steel (instead of bubbling air from below), reducing the amount of nitrogen uptake into the steel. The basic oxygen process is used in all modern steelworks; the last Bessemer converter in the U.S. was retired in 1968. Furthermore, the last three decades have seen a massive increase in the mini-mill business, where scrap steel only is melted with an [[electric arc furnace]]. These mills only produced bar products at first, but have since expanded into flat and heavy products, once the exclusive domain of the integrated steelworks.\n\nUntil these 19th-century developments, steel was an expensive commodity and only used for a limited number of purposes where a particularly hard or flexible metal was needed, as in the cutting edges of tools and springs.  The widespread availability of inexpensive steel powered the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] and modern society as we know it.  Mild steel ultimately replaced wrought iron for almost all purposes, and wrought iron is no longer commercially produced.  With minor exceptions, alloy steels only began to be made in the late 19th century.  [[Stainless steel]] was developed on the eve of [[World War I]] and was not widely used until the 1920s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Damascus Steel]]\n* [[Steel#History of steelmaking|History of steelmaking]]\n* [[Iron Age]]\n* [[Nok culture]]\n* [[Non-ferrous extractive metallurgy]]\n* [[Roman metallurgy]]\n* [[Bintie]], a Chinese possibly carbon steel\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* Ebrey, Walthall, Palais, (2006).

During the medieval period, means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from [[cast iron]] (in this context known as [[pig iron]]) using [[finery forge]]s. For all these processes, [[charcoal]] was required as [[fuel]].\n\n[[Steel]] (with a carbon content between pig iron and wrought iron) was first produced in antiquity as an alloy. Its process of production, [[Wootz steel]], was exported before the 4th century BC from India to ancient China, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Archaeological evidence of [[cast iron]] appears in 5th-century BC China.<ref name=\"Wagner\" /> New methods of producing it by [[carburizing]] bars of iron in the [[cementation process]] were devised in the 17th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], new methods of producing bar iron by substituting [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel, creating a new era of greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age.<ref name=\"Williams1867IronAge\">{{Citation |last=Williams |first=David |year=1867 |title=The Iron Age [weekly journal] |publisher=David Williams |location=New York |oclc=5257259 |lccn=sc82008005 |issn=0021-1508 |postscript=.}}</ref> In the late 1850s, [[Henry Bessemer]] invented a [[Bessemer process|new steelmaking process]], that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off carbon, and so to produce mild steel.

That source can often be identified with certainty because of the unique [[crystal]]line features ([[Widmanst\u00e4tten pattern]]s) of that material, which are preserved when the metal is worked cold or at low temperature.  Those artifacts include, for example, a [[bead]] from the 5th millennium BC found in [[Iran]]<ref name=ephotos /> and spear tips and ornaments from [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Sumer]] around 4000 BC.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\">R.

Meteoritic iron is very rare, and the metal was probably very expensive, perhaps more expensive than [[gold]]. The early [[Hittites]] are known to have [[barter]]ed iron (meteoritic or smelted) for [[silver]], at a rate of 40 times the iron's weight, with the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] in the first centuries of the [[2nd millennium BC|second millennium BC]].<ref name=Veenhof>{{cite book|last1=Veenhof|first1=Klaas |authorlink1=Klaas Veenhof|last2=Eidem|first2=Jesper|authorlink2=Jesper Eidem|title=Mesopotamia : Ann\u00e4herungen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYMmrenUywQC&pg=PA84|year=2008|publisher=Saint-Paul|isbn=978-3-525-53452-6|pages=84}}</ref>\n\nMeteoric iron was also fashioned into tools in the [[Arctic]], about the year 1000, when the [[Thule people]] of [[Greenland]] began making [[harpoon]]s, knives, [[ulu]]s and other edged tools from pieces of the [[Cape York meteorite]]. Typically pea-size bits of metal were cold-hammered into disks and fitted to a bone handle.<ref name=ephotos /> These artifacts were also used as trade goods with other Arctic peoples: tools made from the Cape York meteorite have been found in archaeological sites more than {{convert|1000|miles}} distant.

Iron is a common impurity in copper ores and iron ore was sometimes used as a [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]], thus it is not surprising that humans mastered the technology of smelted iron only after several millennia of [[bronze|bronze metallurgy]].<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>\n\nThe place and time for the discovery of iron smelting is not known, partly because of the difficulty of distinguishing metal extracted from nickel-containing ores from hot-worked meteoritic iron.<ref name=ephotos />  The archaeological evidence seems to point to the Middle East area, during the [[Bronze Age]] in the 3rd millennium BC.

As the technology spread, iron came to replace bronze as the dominant metal used for tools and weapons across the Eastern Mediterranean (the [[Levant]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]], [[Crete]], Anatolia and Egypt).<ref name=waldbaum />\n\nIron was originally smelted in [[bloomery|bloomeries]], furnaces where [[bellows]] were used to force air through a pile of iron ore and burning [[charcoal]]. The [[carbon monoxide]] produced by the charcoal reduced the [[iron oxide]] from the ore to metallic iron. The bloomery, however, was not hot enough to melt the iron, so the metal collected in the bottom of the furnace as a spongy mass, or ''bloom''. Workers then repeatedly beat and folded it to force out the molten slag. This laborious, time-consuming process produced [[wrought iron]], a malleable but fairly soft alloy.\n\nConcurrent with the transition from bronze to iron was the discovery of [[carburization]], the process of adding carbon to wrought iron. While the iron bloom contained some carbon, the subsequent hot-working [[oxidation|oxidized]] most of it. Smiths in the Middle East discovered that wrought iron could be turned into a much harder product by heating the finished piece in a bed of charcoal, and then [[quench]]ing it in water or oil. This procedure turned the outer layers of the piece into [[steel]], an alloy of iron and [[iron carbide]]s, with an inner core of less brittle iron.\n\n==== Theories on the origin of iron smelting ====\nThe development of iron smelting was traditionally attributed to the [[Hittites]] of Anatolia of the Late [[Bronze Age]].<ref name=mulhy>Muhly, James D. 'Metalworking/Mining in the Levant' pp. 174-183 in ''Near Eastern Archaeology'' ed. Suzanne Richard (2003), pp. 179-180.</ref> It was believed that they maintained a monopoly on iron working, and that their empire had been based on that advantage. According to that theory, the ancient [[Sea Peoples]], who invaded the Eastern Mediterranean and destroyed the Hittite empire at the end of the Late Bronze Age, were responsible for spreading the knowledge through that region. This theory is no longer held in the mainstream of scholarship,<ref name=mulhy /> since there is no archaeological evidence of the alleged Hittite monopoly. While there are some iron objects from Bronze Age Anatolia, the number is comparable to iron objects found in Egypt and other places of the same time period, and only a small number of those objects were weapons.<ref name=\"Waldbaum 1978: 23\" />\n\nA more recent theory claims that the development of iron technology was driven by the disruption of the [[copper]] and [[tin]] trade routes, due to the collapse of the empires at the end of the Late Bronze Age.<ref name=mulhy />  These metals, especially tin, were not widely available and metal workers had to transport them over long distances, whereas iron ores were widely available. However, no known archaeological evidence suggests a shortage of bronze or tin in the Early Iron Age.<ref>Muhly 2003:180.</ref>  Bronze objects remained abundant, and these objects have the same percentage of tin as those from the Late Bronze Age.\n\n=== Indian Sub-Continent ===\n[[File:QtubIronPillar.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Iron pillar of Delhi]]]]\nThe history of ferrous metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent began in the 2nd millennium BC.

By this time, Chinese metallurgists had discovered how to fine molten pig iron, stirring it in the open air until it lost its carbon and could be hammered (wrought). (In modern Mandarin-[[Chinese language|Chinese]], this process is now called ''chao'', literally, [[stir frying]].) By the 1st century BC, Chinese metallurgists had found that wrought iron and cast iron could be melted together to yield an alloy of intermediate carbon content, that is, steel.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 3 197\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 197.</ref><ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 3 277\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 277.</ref><ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 3 563g\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 563&nbsp;g</ref> According to legend, the sword of [[Liu Bang]], the first Han emperor, was made in this fashion.

European metal workers continued to produce iron in bloomeries.  However, the [[Medieval]] period brought two developments\u2014the use of water power in the bloomery process in various places (outlined above), and the first European production in cast iron.\n\n=== Powered bloomeries ===\n{{Main|Bloomery}}\nSometime in the medieval period, water power was applied to the bloomery process.  It is possible that this was at the [[Cistercian]] Abbey of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]] as early as 1135, but it was certainly in use in early 13th century [[France]] and Sweden.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lucas | first1 = A.

In the [[Furness]] district of England, powered bloomeries were in use into the beginning of the 18th century, and near [[Garstang]] until about 1770.\n\nThe Catalan Forge was a variety of powered bloomery.

F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}</ref>\n\nThrough a good portion of the Middle Ages, in Western Europe, iron was still being made by the working of iron blooms into wrought iron. Some of the earliest casting of iron in Europe occurred in Sweden, in two sites, [[Lapphyttan]] and Vinarhyttan, between 1150 and 1350. Some scholars have speculated the practice followed the [[Mongol]]s across [[Russia]] to these sites, but there is no clear proof of this hypothesis, and it would certainly not explain the pre-Mongol datings of many of these iron-production centres. In any event, by the late 14th century, a market for cast iron goods began to form, as a demand developed for cast iron cannonballs.\n\n=== Finery forge ===\n{{Main|Finery forge}}\nAn alternative method of [[decarburization|decarburising]] [[pig iron]] was the [[finery forge]], which seems to have been devised in the region around [[Namur (city)|Namur]] in the 15th century.  By the end of that century, this [[Wallonia|Walloon]] process spread  to the ''Pay de Bray'' on the eastern boundary of [[Normandy]], and then to England, where it became the main method of making wrought iron by 1600.  It was introduced to Sweden by [[Louis De Geer (1587\u20131652)|Louis de Geer]] in the early 17th century and was used to make the [[oregrounds iron]] favoured by English steelmakers.\n\nA variation on this was the [[Finery forge#German forge|German forge]].  This became the main method of producing [[bar iron]] in Sweden.\n\n=== Cementation process ===\n{{Main|Cementation process}}\nIn the early 17th century, ironworkers in [[Western Europe]] had developed the [[cementation process]] for [[carburization|carburizing]] [[wrought iron]]. Wrought iron bars and charcoal were packed into stone boxes, then sealed with clay to be held at a red heat continually tended in an oxygen-free state immersed in nearly pure carbon (charcoal) for up to a week.  During this time, carbon diffused into the surface layers of the iron, producing ''cement steel'' or ''blister steel''&mdash;also known as case hardened, where the portions wrapped in iron (the pick or axe blade) became harder, than say an axe hammer-head or shaft socket which might be insulated by clay to keep them from the carbon source.  The earliest place where this process was used in England was at [[Coalbrookdale]] from 1619, where Sir Basil Brooke had two cementation furnaces (recently excavated <!-- {{when|date=October 2016}} --->in 2001&ndash;2005<ref>Belford and Ross, Paper: [https://www.academia.edu/175895/English_steelmaking_in_the_seventeenth_century_the_excavation_of_two_cementation_furnaces_at_Coalbrookdale English steelmaking in the seventeenth century: the excavation of two cementation furnaces at Coalbrookdale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510201753/http://www.academia.edu/175895/English_steelmaking_in_the_seventeenth_century_the_excavation_of_two_cementation_furnaces_at_Coalbrookdale |date=2018-05-10 }}, Academia.edu, accessdate=30 March 2017</ref>).  For a time in the 1610s, he owned a patent on the process, but had to surrender this in 1619.  He probably used [[Forest of Dean]] iron as his raw material, but it was soon found that oregrounds iron was more suitable.  The quality of the steel could be improved by [[faggoting (metalworking)|faggoting]], producing the so-called shear steel.\n\n=== Crucible steel ===\nIn the 1740s, [[Benjamin Huntsman]] found a means of melting blister steel, made by the cementation process, in crucibles.  The resulting  [[crucible steel]], usually cast in ingots, was more homogeneous than blister steel.<ref name=Tylecote>{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.

By the 18th century, the availability of wood for making charcoal was limiting the expansion of iron production, so that England became increasingly dependent for a considerable part of the iron required by its industry, on Sweden (from the mid-17th century) and then from about 1725 also on Russia.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSmelting with coal (or its derivative [[coke (fuel)|coke]]) was a long sought objective.  The production of pig iron with coke was probably achieved by [[Dud Dudley]] in the 1620s, and with a mixed fuel made from coal and wood again in the 1670s.  However this was probably only a technological rather than a commercial success.  [[Shadrach Fox]] may have smelted iron with coke at Coalbrookdale in [[Shropshire]] in the 1690s, but only to make cannonballs and other cast iron products such as shells.  However, in the peace after the [[Nine Years War]], there was no demand for these.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = P.

His pots were thinner and hence cheaper than those of his rivals.   Needing a larger supply of pig iron he leased the blast furnace at Coalbrookdale in 1709.  There, he made iron using coke, thus establishing the first successful business in Europe to do so.  His products were all of cast iron, though his immediate successors attempted (with little commercial success) to fine this to bar iron.<ref>A. Raistrick, ''A dynasty of Ironfounders'' (1953; 1989); N. Cox, 'Imagination and innovation of an industrial pioneer: The first Abraham Darby' ''Industrial Archaeology Review'' 12(2) (1990), 127-144.</ref>\n\n[[Wrought iron|Bar iron]] thus continued normally to be made with charcoal pig iron until the mid-1750s.  In 1755 [[Abraham Darby II]] (with partners) opened a new coke-using furnace at [[Horsehay]] in Shropshire, and this was followed by others.  These supplied coke pig iron to finery forges of the traditional kind for the production of [[wrought iron|bar iron]].  The reason for the delay remains controversial.<ref>A. Raistrick, ''Dynasty''; C. K. Hyde, ''Technological change and the British iron industry 1700\u20131870'' (Princeton, 1977), 37-41; P. W. King, 'The Iron Trade in England and Wales 1500\u20131815' (Ph.D. thesis, Wolverhampton University, 2003), 128-41.</ref>\n\n=== New forge processes ===\n[[File:Puddling furnace.jpg|thumb|Schematic drawing of a puddling furnace]]\nIt was only after this that economically viable means of converting pig iron to bar iron began to be devised.  A process known as [[potting and stamping]] was devised in the 1760s and improved in the 1770s, and seems to have been widely adopted in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] from about 1785. However, this was largely replaced by [[Henry Cort]]'s puddling process, patented in 1784, but probably only made to work with grey pig iron in about 1790. These processes permitted the great expansion in the production of iron that constitutes the Industrial Revolution for the iron industry.<ref>G. R. Morton and N. Mutton, 'The transition to Cort's puddling process' ''Journal of Iron and Steel Institute'' 205(7) (1967), 722-8; R. A. Mott (ed. P. Singer), ''Henry Cort: The great finer: creator of puddled iron'' (1983); P. W. King, 'Iron Trade', 185-93.</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, Hall discovered that the addition of iron oxide to the charge of the puddling furnace caused a violent reaction, in which the pig iron was [[decarburization|decarburised]], this became known as 'wet puddling'. It was also found possible to produce steel by stopping the [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] before decarburisation was complete.\n\n== Hot blast ==\n{{Main|Hot blast}}\n\nThe efficiency of the blast furnace was improved by the change to [[hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in Scotland in 1828.  This further reduced production costs.  Within a few decades, the practice was to have a 'stove' as large as the furnace next to it into which the waste gas (containing CO) from the furnace was directed and burnt.  The resultant heat was used to preheat the air blown into the furnace.<ref>A. Birch, ''Economic History of the British Iron and Steel Industry'' , 181-9; C. K. Hyde, ''Technological Change and the British iron industry'' (Princeton 1977), 146-59.</ref>\n\n== Industrial steelmaking ==\n{{Main|Steelmaking}}\n[[File:Bessemer converter.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic drawing of a Bessemer converter]]\n\nApart from some production of puddled steel, English steel continued to be made by the cementation process, sometimes followed by remelting to produce crucible steel.  These were batch-based processes whose raw material was bar iron, particularly Swedish oregrounds iron.\n\nThe problem of mass-producing cheap steel was solved in 1855 by Henry Bessemer, with the introduction of the [[Bessemer process|Bessemer converter]] at his steelworks in [[Sheffield]], England. (An early converter can still be seen at the city's [[Kelham Island Museum]]). In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron from the blast furnace was charged into a large crucible, and then air was blown through the molten iron from below, igniting the dissolved carbon from the coke. As the carbon burned off, the melting point of the mixture increased, but the heat from the burning carbon provided the extra energy needed to keep the mixture molten. After the carbon content in the melt had dropped to the desired level, the air draft was cut off: a typical Bessemer converter could convert a 25-ton batch of pig iron to steel in half an hour.\n\nFinally, the [[Basic oxygen steelmaking|basic oxygen process]] was introduced at the Voest-Alpine works in 1952; a modification of the basic Bessemer process, it lances oxygen from above the steel (instead of bubbling air from below), reducing the amount of nitrogen uptake into the steel. The basic oxygen process is used in all modern steelworks; the last Bessemer converter in the U.S. was retired in 1968. Furthermore, the last three decades have seen a massive increase in the mini-mill business, where scrap steel only is melted with an [[electric arc furnace]]. These mills only produced bar products at first, but have since expanded into flat and heavy products, once the exclusive domain of the integrated steelworks.\n\nUntil these 19th-century developments, steel was an expensive commodity and only used for a limited number of purposes where a particularly hard or flexible metal was needed, as in the cutting edges of tools and springs.  The widespread availability of inexpensive steel powered the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] and modern society as we know it.  Mild steel ultimately replaced wrought iron for almost all purposes, and wrought iron is no longer commercially produced.  With minor exceptions, alloy steels only began to be made in the late 19th century.  [[Stainless steel]] was developed on the eve of [[World War I]] and was not widely used until the 1920s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Damascus Steel]]\n* [[Steel#History of steelmaking|History of steelmaking]]\n* [[Iron Age]]\n* [[Nok culture]]\n* [[Non-ferrous extractive metallurgy]]\n* [[Roman metallurgy]]\n* [[Bintie]], a Chinese possibly carbon steel\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* Ebrey, Walthall, Palais, (2006).

It played an important role when Ferrara enjoyed its greatest splendor in the 15th and 16th century, with the duke [[Ercole I d'Este]]. The situation of the Jews deteriorated in 1598, when the Este dynasty moved to Modena and the city came under papal control. The Jewish settlement, located in three streets forming a triangle near the cathedral, became a [[ghetto]] in 1627. Apart from a few years under [[Napoleon]] and during the 1848 revolution, the ghetto lasted until [[Italian unification]] in 1859.\n\nIn 1799, the Jewish community saved the city from sacking by troops of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the spring of 1799, the city had fallen into the hands of the [[Republic of France]], which established a small garrison there. On 15&nbsp;April, Lieutenant Field Marshal [[Johann von Klenau]] approached the fortress with a modest mixed force of Austrian cavalry, artillery and infantry augmented by Italian peasant rebels, commanded by Count Antonio Bardaniand and demanded its capitulation. The commander refused. Klenau blockaded the city, leaving a small group of artillery and troops to continue the siege.<ref>Colonel Danilo Oreskovich and 1,300&nbsp;Croatians of the 2nd Banat battalion, 4,000&nbsp;Ferrarese auxiliary troops commanded by Count Antonio Gardani, and several hundred local peasants commanded by Major Angelo Pietro Poli.

The besieged garrison made several sorties from the Saint Paul's Gate, which were repulsed by the insurgent peasants. The French attempted two rescues of the beleaguered fortress: the first, on 24&nbsp;April, when a force of 400&nbsp;Modenese was repulsed at Mirandola. In the second, General [[Montrichard]] tried to raise the city-blockade by advancing with a force of 4,000.

After making the standard request for surrender at 0800, which was refused, Klenau ordered a barrage from his mortars and howitzers. After two [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]] caught fire, the commandant was summoned again to surrender; there was some delay, but a flag of truce was sent at 2100, and the capitulation was concluded at 0100 the next day.

It is served with a sauce of [[butter]] and [[Salvia officinalis|sage]] or [[bolognese sauce]]. Another peculiar dish, that was allegedly cooked by Renaissance chef [[Cristoforo di Messisbugo]], is ''pasticcio di maccheroni'', a domed [[macaroni]] pie, consisting of a crust of sweet dough enclosing macaroni in a [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]], studded with [[porcini]] mushrooms and [[rag\u00f9 bolognese]].\n\nThe traditional [[Christmas]] first course is [[cappelletti]], large meat and cheese filled ravioli served in chicken broth. It is often followed by ''salama da sugo'', a very big, cured [[sausage]] made from a selection of pork meats and spices kneaded with red wine.\n\nSeafood is also an important part of the local tradition, that boast rich fisheries in the Po delta lagoons and Adriatic sea. Pasta with [[clams]] and grilled or stewed [[eel]] dishes are especially well-known. Popular food items include also ''zia'' garlic salami and the traditional [[Coppia ferrarese|coppia]] bread, protected by the IGP ([[Protected Geographical Status]]) label.<ref name=zhou>{{cite book | last1=Zhou | first1=Weibiao | last2=Hui | first2=Y.
