It was founded by [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] Governor [[Fernando Chac\u00f3n]] in 1795, to act as fortified plaza and trading outpost for the neighboring [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Taos Pueblo]] (the town's namesake) and [[Hispanos of New Mexico|Hispano]] communities, including [[Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico|Ranchos de Taos]], Ca\u00f1on, Taos Canyon, Ranchitos, [[El Prado, New Mexico|El Prado]], and [[Arroyo Seco, New Mexico|Arroyo Seco]]. The town was incorporated in 1934. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], its population was 5,716.\n\nTaos is the [[county seat]] of Taos County. The English name ''Taos'' derives from the native [[Taos language]] meaning \"place of red willows\".\n\nTaos is the principal city of the Taos, NM [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Taos County.\n\n==History==\n\n===Taos Pueblo===\n{{main|Taos Pueblo}}\nThe [[Taos Pueblo]], which borders the north boundary of the town of Taos, has been occupied for nearly a [[millennium]]. It is estimated that the pueblo was built between 1000 and 1450&nbsp;A.D., with some later expansion, and the pueblo is considered to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the United States.<ref name=TAOSAbout>{{cite web |url=http://taospueblo.com/about/ |title=About Taos Pueblo FAQs |publisher=Taos Pueblo |accessdate=2016-10-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025073329/http://taospueblo.com/about/ |archivedate=2016-10-25 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLocated in a tributary valley off the [[Rio Grande]], it is the most northern of the [[New Mexico]] [[pueblo]]s. The pueblo, at some places five stories high, is a combination of many individual homes with common walls. There are over 1,900 Taos Puebloans living within the greater pueblo-area community. Many of them have modern homes near their fields and live there in summer months, only staying at their homes within the main North or South pueblo buildings during cooler weather. About 150 people live within the main pueblo buildings year-round.<ref name=TAOSAbout/> The Taos Pueblo was added as a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1992.<ref name=UNESCOWHS>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/492 |title=Taos Pueblo |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=2016-10-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620230953/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/492/ |archivedate=2016-06-20 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish colonization===\nTaos was established c. 1615 as ''Don Fernando de Taos'', following the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]] of the Indian [[Pueblo]] villages. Initially, relations of the Spanish settlers with [[Taos Pueblo]] were amicable,<ref>2007, Mapa Historico de Taos, Taos Kiwanis Club</ref> but resentment of meddling by missionaries, and demands by ''[[Encomienda|encomenderos]]'' for tribute, led to a revolt in 1640; Taos Indians killed their priest and a number of Spanish settlers, and fled the pueblo, not returning until 1661.<ref name=THS>{{cite web |url= http://www.taos-history.org/time.html |title=Taos Timeline | publisher=Taos County Historical Society |accessdate=2011-06-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1680, Taos Pueblo joined the widespread [[Pueblo Revolt]]. After the Spanish Reconquest of 1692, Taos Pueblo continued armed resistance to the Spanish until 1696, when Governor [[Diego de Vargas]] defeated the Indians at Taos Canyon.<ref name=THS/>\n\nDuring the 1770s, Taos was repeatedly raided by [[Comanche]]s who lived on the [[great Plains|plains]] of what is now eastern [[Colorado]]. [[Juan Bautista de Anza]], governor of the [[Province of New Mexico, Mexico|Province of New Mexico]], led a successful [[punitive expedition]] in 1779 against the Comanches.<ref>{{cite web|title=Koshare Indian Museum: Taos, New Mexico|url=http://www.kosharehistory.org/visitors/taos.html|accessdate=2014-07-07}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1780 and 1800, Don Fernando de Taos (now Taos) was established.<ref name=NPS /> Between 1796 and 1797 the Don Fernando de Taos Land Grant gave land to 63 Spanish families in the Taos valley.<ref name=\"Taos CofC History\">[http://www.taoschamber.org/Visitor-Info/Taos-History Taos History.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121064630/http://www.taoschamber.org/Visitor-Info/Taos-History |date=2015-01-21 }} Taos Chamber of Commerce.

After the U.S. takeover of New Mexico in 1847, Hispanics and American Indians in Taos staged a rebellion, known as the [[Taos Revolt]], in which the newly appointed U.S. Governor, [[Charles Bent]], was killed. New Mexico was a territory of the United States beginning 1850 and became a state in 1912.\n\nFor historical reasons, the American flag is displayed continuously at [[Taos Plaza]] (both day and night). This derives from the time of the [[American Civil War]], when Confederate sympathizers in the area attempted to remove the flag. The Union officer [[Kit Carson]] sought to discourage this activity by having guards surround the area and fly the flag 24&nbsp;hours a day.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nfwRPe99u6QC | author=Zora O'Neill| title=Santa Fe, Taos, & Albuquerque| publisher=Moon Handbooks| year=2006| page=95| accessdate=2009-07-24 | isbn=978-1-56691-879-4 }}</ref>\n\n\"The Padre of Isleta\", [[Anton Docher]] first served as a priest in Taos before leaving for [[Isleta]] in 1891.<ref>{{cite book | author=Crane, L |title=Desert drums: the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, 1540\u20131928 | year=1972 |publisher=Rio Grande Press}}</ref>\n\n===Taos art colony===\n{{main|Taos Society of Artists|Taos art colony}}\nBeginning in 1899, artists began to settle in Taos; six formed the [[Taos Society of Artists]] in 1915. In time, the [[Taos art colony]] developed. Many paintings were made of local scenes, especially of [[Taos Pueblo]] and activities there, as the artists often modelled Native Americans from the pueblo in their paintings. Some of the artists' studios have been preserved and may be viewed by visitors to Taos. These include the [[Ernest L. Blumenschein House]], the [[Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio\u2014Joseph Henry Sharp Studios]], and the [[Nicolai Fechin]] house, all of which are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=Blieler>Bleiler, 75.</ref><ref name=\"Taos Daily\">{{cite journal | author1=Whaley, B | author2=Stiny, A | url=http://www.taosdaily.com/index.php?fuseaction=home.viewarticle&article_id=2789 | title=\"Reconsidering Art in Taos; Bert Phillips\" in ''Taos Horse Fly'' | journal=Taos Daily | accessdate=2009-02-17 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310092234/http://www.taosdaily.com/index.php?fuseaction=home.viewarticle&article_id=2789 | archivedate=2012-03-10 }}</ref>  Influential later 20th-century Taos artists include [[R.

It is normally celebrated the 3rd weekend of July.\nThe Fiestas are a celebratory tradition passed from generation to generation, a way of preserving the rich tri\u2010cultural way of life that has developed in Taos over the last four centuries.\nA commemorative Mass and procession from Our Lady of Guadalupe Church officially opens the event on Friday evening, with the crowning of the Fiestas Queen.  The celebration continues with musical and dance performances scheduled on the Plaza every hour. Two parades are staged, a children parade on Saturday and the larger Fiesta Parade on Sunday.<ref>[http://fiestasdetaos.com/ Fiestas de Taos]</ref>\n\n===Bent Street===\nLocated just North of the Taos Plaza, this street was the location of Governor Charles Bent's home.\n\nGovernor Bent was scalped and killed by Pueblo warriors during the Taos Revolt, on January 19, 1847. During the Taos Revolt, Bent's horses were set free from their stable.\n\nThis street now houses the illuminati's New Mexico sector. They used to be more open and well known until a angry mob showed up at their doorstep in 1964. \nNow they must hide inside the walls of the shops of Bent Street. Their heads are shaped like triangles so they can only go out into the sunlight during \nHalloween and hand out Tootsie Rolls.\n\n===Artists homes and studios===\nMany of the historic sites are homes and studios of artists, including the [[Mabel Dodge Luhan House]], [[Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio\u2014Joseph Henry Sharp Studios]], the [[Nicolai Fechin House]], the [[Leon Gaspard House]], and the [[Ernest Martin Hennings]] House. Doc Martin's restaurant in the historic [[Taos Inn]] was previously the office of [[Thomas \"Doc\" Martin]] while other parts of the inn served as his home and the birthplace of the [[Taos Society of Artists]]. On Ledoux street, just south of the Taos Plaza, is the [[Ernest L. Blumenschein House]] and [[Harwood Museum of Art|Harwood House]]. The [[Helene Wurlitzer Foundation]] is a non-profit organization that provides free residency to eleven artists, with each year divided into three residency sessions of three months apiece.\n\n===Other historic sites===\nThe center of the [[Taos Downtown Historic District]] is the Taos Plaza.  Just west of that is the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe (Taos, New Mexico)|Our Lady of Guadalupe Church]].  North of the Taos Plaza is the [[Governor Charles Bent House]] and the [[Taos Inn]]. Further north in Taos The Bernard Beimer House. On the southwestern edge of the Taos Historic district is La Loma Plaza Historic District. East of the plaza on Kit Carson Road is the [[Kit Carson House]].\n\nNorth of Taos is the Turley Mill and Distillery Site and the [[Rio Grande Gorge Bridge]]. Just outside Taos in Ranchitos is the [[Martinez Hacienda]], the home turned museum of the late Padre [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez]]. South of Taos is the [[Ranchos de Taos Plaza]] with the [[San Francisco de Asis Mission Church]].\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Taos Historic District Places from Taos Plaza'''\n|Northwest =\n|North     = [[Governor Charles Bent House]], [[Taos Inn]], The Bernard Beimer House, [[Taos Art Museum]], the [[Nicolai Fechin House]], [[Taos Pueblo]]\n|Northeast = [[Mabel Dodge Luhan House]]\n|Centre    = Taos Plaza within the<br>[[Taos Downtown Historic District]]\n|East      = [[Kit Carson House]], [[Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio\u2014Joseph Henry Sharp Studios]], [[Ernest Martin Hennings]] House, the Leon Gaspard House\n|West      = [[Our Lady of Guadalupe (Taos, New Mexico)|Our Lady of Guadalupe Church]]\n|Southwest = [[La Loma Plaza Historic District]]\n|South     = [[Ernest L.

It was founded by [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] Governor [[Fernando Chac\u00f3n]] in 1795, to act as fortified plaza and trading outpost for the neighboring [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Taos Pueblo]] (the town's namesake) and [[Hispanos of New Mexico|Hispano]] communities, including [[Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico|Ranchos de Taos]], Ca\u00f1on, Taos Canyon, Ranchitos, [[El Prado, New Mexico|El Prado]], and [[Arroyo Seco, New Mexico|Arroyo Seco]]. The town was incorporated in 1934. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], its population was 5,716.\n\nTaos is the [[county seat]] of Taos County. The English name ''Taos'' derives from the native [[Taos language]] meaning \"place of red willows\".\n\nTaos is the principal city of the Taos, NM [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Taos County.\n\n==History==\n\n===Taos Pueblo===\n{{main|Taos Pueblo}}\nThe [[Taos Pueblo]], which borders the north boundary of the town of Taos, has been occupied for nearly a [[millennium]]. It is estimated that the pueblo was built between 1000 and 1450&nbsp;A.D., with some later expansion, and the pueblo is considered to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the United States.<ref name=TAOSAbout>{{cite web |url=http://taospueblo.com/about/ |title=About Taos Pueblo FAQs |publisher=Taos Pueblo |accessdate=2016-10-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025073329/http://taospueblo.com/about/ |archivedate=2016-10-25 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLocated in a tributary valley off the [[Rio Grande]], it is the most northern of the [[New Mexico]] [[pueblo]]s. The pueblo, at some places five stories high, is a combination of many individual homes with common walls. There are over 1,900 Taos Puebloans living within the greater pueblo-area community. Many of them have modern homes near their fields and live there in summer months, only staying at their homes within the main North or South pueblo buildings during cooler weather. About 150 people live within the main pueblo buildings year-round.<ref name=TAOSAbout/> The Taos Pueblo was added as a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1992.<ref name=UNESCOWHS>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/492 |title=Taos Pueblo |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=2016-10-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620230953/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/492/ |archivedate=2016-06-20 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish colonization===\nTaos was established c. 1615 as ''Don Fernando de Taos'', following the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]] of the Indian [[Pueblo]] villages. Initially, relations of the Spanish settlers with [[Taos Pueblo]] were amicable,<ref>2007, Mapa Historico de Taos, Taos Kiwanis Club</ref> but resentment of meddling by missionaries, and demands by ''[[Encomienda|encomenderos]]'' for tribute, led to a revolt in 1640; Taos Indians killed their priest and a number of Spanish settlers, and fled the pueblo, not returning until 1661.<ref name=THS>{{cite web |url= http://www.taos-history.org/time.html |title=Taos Timeline | publisher=Taos County Historical Society |accessdate=2011-06-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1680, Taos Pueblo joined the widespread [[Pueblo Revolt]]. After the Spanish Reconquest of 1692, Taos Pueblo continued armed resistance to the Spanish until 1696, when Governor [[Diego de Vargas]] defeated the Indians at Taos Canyon.<ref name=THS/>\n\nDuring the 1770s, Taos was repeatedly raided by [[Comanche]]s who lived on the [[great Plains|plains]] of what is now eastern [[Colorado]]. [[Juan Bautista de Anza]], governor of the [[Province of New Mexico, Mexico|Province of New Mexico]], led a successful [[punitive expedition]] in 1779 against the Comanches.<ref>{{cite web|title=Koshare Indian Museum: Taos, New Mexico|url=http://www.kosharehistory.org/visitors/taos.html|accessdate=2014-07-07}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1780 and 1800, Don Fernando de Taos (now Taos) was established.<ref name=NPS /> Between 1796 and 1797 the Don Fernando de Taos Land Grant gave land to 63 Spanish families in the Taos valley.<ref name=\"Taos CofC History\">[http://www.taoschamber.org/Visitor-Info/Taos-History Taos History.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121064630/http://www.taoschamber.org/Visitor-Info/Taos-History |date=2015-01-21 }} Taos Chamber of Commerce.

After the U.S. takeover of New Mexico in 1847, Hispanics and American Indians in Taos staged a rebellion, known as the [[Taos Revolt]], in which the newly appointed U.S. Governor, [[Charles Bent]], was killed. New Mexico was a territory of the United States beginning 1850 and became a state in 1912.\n\nFor historical reasons, the American flag is displayed continuously at [[Taos Plaza]] (both day and night). This derives from the time of the [[American Civil War]], when Confederate sympathizers in the area attempted to remove the flag. The Union officer [[Kit Carson]] sought to discourage this activity by having guards surround the area and fly the flag 24&nbsp;hours a day.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nfwRPe99u6QC | author=Zora O'Neill| title=Santa Fe, Taos, & Albuquerque| publisher=Moon Handbooks| year=2006| page=95| accessdate=2009-07-24 | isbn=978-1-56691-879-4 }}</ref>\n\n\"The Padre of Isleta\", [[Anton Docher]] first served as a priest in Taos before leaving for [[Isleta]] in 1891.<ref>{{cite book | author=Crane, L |title=Desert drums: the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, 1540\u20131928 | year=1972 |publisher=Rio Grande Press}}</ref>\n\n===Taos art colony===\n{{main|Taos Society of Artists|Taos art colony}}\nBeginning in 1899, artists began to settle in Taos; six formed the [[Taos Society of Artists]] in 1915.

Some of the artists' studios have been preserved and may be viewed by visitors to Taos. These include the [[Ernest L. Blumenschein House]], the [[Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio\u2014Joseph Henry Sharp Studios]], and the [[Nicolai Fechin]] house, all of which are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=Blieler>Bleiler, 75.</ref><ref name=\"Taos Daily\">{{cite journal | author1=Whaley, B | author2=Stiny, A | url=http://www.taosdaily.com/index.php?fuseaction=home.viewarticle&article_id=2789 | title=\"Reconsidering Art in Taos; Bert Phillips\" in ''Taos Horse Fly'' | journal=Taos Daily | accessdate=2009-02-17 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310092234/http://www.taosdaily.com/index.php?fuseaction=home.viewarticle&article_id=2789 | archivedate=2012-03-10 }}</ref>  Influential later 20th-century Taos artists include [[R.

It is normally celebrated the 3rd weekend of July.\nThe Fiestas are a celebratory tradition passed from generation to generation, a way of preserving the rich tri\u2010cultural way of life that has developed in Taos over the last four centuries.\nA commemorative Mass and procession from Our Lady of Guadalupe Church officially opens the event on Friday evening, with the crowning of the Fiestas Queen.  The celebration continues with musical and dance performances scheduled on the Plaza every hour. Two parades are staged, a children parade on Saturday and the larger Fiesta Parade on Sunday.<ref>[http://fiestasdetaos.com/ Fiestas de Taos]</ref>\n\n===Bent Street===\nLocated just North of the Taos Plaza, this street was the location of Governor Charles Bent's home.\n\nGovernor Bent was scalped and killed by Pueblo warriors during the Taos Revolt, on January 19, 1847. During the Taos Revolt, Bent's horses were set free from their stable.\n\n===Artists homes and studios===\nMany of the historic sites are homes and studios of artists, including the [[Mabel Dodge Luhan House]], [[Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio\u2014Joseph Henry Sharp Studios]], the [[Nicolai Fechin House]], the [[Leon Gaspard House]], and the [[Ernest Martin Hennings]] House. Doc Martin's restaurant in the historic [[Taos Inn]] was previously the office of [[Thomas \"Doc\" Martin]] while other parts of the inn served as his home and the birthplace of the [[Taos Society of Artists]]. On Ledoux street, just south of the Taos Plaza, is the [[Ernest L. Blumenschein House]] and [[Harwood Museum of Art|Harwood House]]. The [[Helene Wurlitzer Foundation]] is a non-profit organization that provides free residency to eleven artists, with each year divided into three residency sessions of three months apiece.\n\n===Other historic sites===\nThe center of the [[Taos Downtown Historic District]] is the Taos Plaza.  Just west of that is the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe (Taos, New Mexico)|Our Lady of Guadalupe Church]].  North of the Taos Plaza is the [[Governor Charles Bent House]] and the [[Taos Inn]].

Its official creation date is July 1971 during the [[Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971]]. In 1971, with [[West Pakistan]] imposing a brutal military crackdown in [[East Pakistan]], the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, ''PADMA'' and ''PALASH'', and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small [[patrol vessel]]s, was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|title=War of Liberation, The|publisher=banglapedia.org}}</ref> These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the [[Indian Air Force]] on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |title=Bangladesh Navy in Liberation War |website=Bangladesh Navy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092723/http://bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |archive-date=13 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Independence to the end of the 20th century===\nThe navy carried out around 45 operations during the war: traditional naval operations and unconventional [[commando]] operations including [[guerrilla warfare]].  In the first leg of the war, defecting [[Bengal]]i sailors joined the guerrilla forces. It was the eight sailors who defected from the [[Pakistan Navy]] submarine ''PNS Mangro'', under construction in France, that pioneered the formation of the naval element during the Liberation War.  Later many other naval personnel participated.  During the Liberation War, [[East Pakistan]] was divided into 11 sectors.  Each sector had a Commander and a demarcated area of responsibility except sector 10. Sector 10 was nominally responsible for the coastal belt but actually operated over the entire country.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Navy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704035414/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, it was imperative for the occupation force to keep ports and harbours operative and the sea lines of communication open. The Bangladesh Navy fought to block the sea lines of communication, and to make the sea and river ports inoperative. They attacked all the seaports including many river ports. [[Operation Jackpot]] is one of the best known and most successful operations. They carried out [[Naval mine|mining]] in the [[Pasur River]] Channel by patrol craft. With other fighters they also carried out attacks against the Pakistan Army.  As a result, Bangladesh became an independent state within the shortest possible time.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Naval Academy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015728/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter independence, especially in the 1970s, additional naval infrastructure was required.

Its official creation date is July 1971 during the [[Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971]]. In 1971, with [[West Pakistan]] imposing a brutal military crackdown in [[East Pakistan]], the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, ''PADMA'' and ''PALASH'', and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small [[patrol vessel]]s, was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|title=War of Liberation, The|publisher=banglapedia.org}}</ref> These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the [[Indian Air Force]] on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |title=Bangladesh Navy in Liberation War |website=Bangladesh Navy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092723/http://bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |archive-date=13 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Independence to the end of the 20th century===\nThe navy carried out around 45 operations during the war: traditional naval operations and unconventional [[commando]] operations including [[guerrilla warfare]].  In the first leg of the war, defecting [[Bengal]]i sailors joined the guerrilla forces. It was the eight sailors who defected from the [[Pakistan Navy]] submarine ''PNS Mangro'', under construction in France, that pioneered the formation of the naval element during the Liberation War.  Later many other naval personnel participated.  During the Liberation War, [[East Pakistan]] was divided into 11 sectors.  Each sector had a Commander and a demarcated area of responsibility except sector 10. Sector 10 was nominally responsible for the coastal belt but actually operated over the entire country.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Navy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704035414/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, it was imperative for the occupation force to keep ports and harbours operative and the sea lines of communication open. The Bangladesh Navy fought to block the sea lines of communication, and to make the sea and river ports inoperative. They attacked all the seaports including many river ports. [[Operation Jackpot]] is one of the best known and most successful operations. They carried out [[Naval mine|mining]] in the [[Pasur River]] Channel by patrol craft. With other fighters they also carried out attacks against the Pakistan Army.  As a result, Bangladesh became an independent state within the shortest possible time.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Naval Academy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015728/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter independence, especially in the 1970s, additional naval infrastructure was required.

It was located in [[Ephesus]] (near the modern town of [[Sel\u00e7uk]] in present-day [[Turkey]]). It was completely rebuilt twice, once after a devastating flood and three hundred years later after an act of arson, and in its final form was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed.<ref>John Freely, ''The Western Shores of Turkey: Discovering the Aegean and Mediterranean Coasts'' 2004, p. 148; Clive Foss, ''Ephesus after antiquity: a late antique, Byzantine, and Turkish city'', Cambridge University Press, 1979, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i6Q8AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PR7&ots=cz_UVafPvu&dq=Artemis%20Ephesus%20John%20Chrysostom%20mob&lr=lang_en&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 86\u201389 & footnote 83.]</ref> Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site.\n\nThe earliest version of the temple (a ''[[temenos]]'') antedated the [[Ionic immigration]] by many years, and dates to the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'', attributed it to the [[Amazons]]. In the 7th century BC, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form, began around 550 BC, under [[Chersiphron]], the Cretan [[architect]], and his son [[Metagenes]]. The project was funded by [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]], and took 10 years to complete. This version of the temple was destroyed in 356 BC by [[Herostratus]] in an act of [[arson]].\n\nThe next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in [[Antipater of Sidon]]'s list of the world's Seven Wonders:\n<blockquote>I have set eyes on the wall of lofty [[Babylon]] on which is a road for chariots, and the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus by the Alpheus]], and the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|hanging gardens]], and the [[Colossus of Rhodes|colossus of the Sun]], and the huge labour of the [[Egyptian pyramids|high pyramids]], and the vast [[Mausoleum of Mausolus|tomb of Mausolus]]; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, \"Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand\".<ref>Antipater, ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' IX.58.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Location and history==\n[[File:Temple of Artemis.jpg|thumb|alt=imaginary Temple of Artemis 16th-century hand-colored engraving by Martin Heemskerck|The fame of the Temple of Artemis was known in the [[Renaissance]], as demonstrated in this imagined portrayal of the temple in a 16th-century hand-colored engraving by [[Martin Heemskerck]].]]\n\nThe Temple of Artemis was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about {{convert|75|km}} south from the modern port city of [[\u0130zmir]], in Turkey. Today the site lies on the edge of the modern town of [[Sel\u00e7uk]].\n\nThe sacred site (''[[temenos]]'') at Ephesus was far older than the ''Artemision'' itself. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was certain that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine of Apollo at [[Didyma]].<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 7.7\u20138.</ref>  He said that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were [[Leleges]] and [[Lydia]]ns.  [[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'' attributed the earliest ''temenos'' at Ephesus to the [[Amazons]], whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image (''bretas'') of Artemis, their matron goddess. Pausanias says that [[Pindar]] believed the temple's founding Amazons to have been involved with the siege at Athens. [[Tacitus]] also believed in the Amazon foundation, however Pausanias believed the temple predated the Amazons.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria | last2=Chesler | first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title=Wonder Woman | publisher=Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn=0-03-005376-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwoman00mars }}</ref>\n\n[[Modern archaeology]] cannot confirm Callimachus's Amazons, but Pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded. Before World War I, site excavations by [[David George Hogarth]] identified three successive temple buildings.<ref>D.G. Hogarth, editor, 1908. ''Excavations at Ephesus''.</ref> Re-excavations in 1987\u201388<ref>{{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|pp=137\u2013160}}</ref> confirmed that the site was occupied as early as the [[Bronze Age]], with a sequence of pottery finds that extend forward to [[Geometric art|Middle Geometric times]], when a [[peripteral]] temple with a floor of hard-packed clay was constructed in the second half of the 8th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|p=142}} noted some still earlier placements of stones, [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] pottery and crude clay animal figurines, but warned \"it is still to early to come to conclusions about a cult sequence.\"</ref> The peripteral temple at Ephesus offers the earliest example of a peripteral type on the coast of Asia Minor, and perhaps the earliest Greek temple surrounded by colonnades anywhere.\n\nIn the 7th century BC, a flood<ref>The flood is dated by fragmentary ceramics: {{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|p=141}}.</ref> destroyed the temple, depositing over half a meter of sand and flotsam over the original clay floor. Among the flood debris were the remains of a carved ivory plaque of a [[griffin]] and the [[Tree of Life]], apparently North Syrian, and some drilled tear-shaped amber drops of elliptical cross-section. These probably once dressed a wooden effigy (''[[xoanon]]'') of the Lady of Ephesus, which must have been destroyed or recovered from the flood. Bammer notes that though the site was prone to flooding, and raised by silt deposits about two metres between the 8th and 6th centuries, and a further 2.4&nbsp;m between the sixth and the fourth, its continued use \"indicates that maintaining the identity of the actual location played an important role in the sacred organization\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|pp=144,153}}.</ref>\n\n[[Heraclitus]] deposited his book \"On Nature\" as a dedication to Artemis in the great temple.\n\n==Second phase==\nThe new temple was sponsored at least in part by [[Croesus]],<ref>see Kevin Leloux, \"The Campaign Of Croesus Against Ephesus: Historical & Archaeological Considerations\", in Polemos 21-2, 2018, p. 47-63 [https://www.academia.edu/38848219/The_Campaign_Of_Croesus_Against_Ephesus_Historical_and_Archaeological_Considerations_Polemos_21-2_2018_p._47-63].</ref> who founded [[Lydia]]'s empire and was overlord of Ephesus,<ref>Herodotus' statement to this effect is confirmed by the conjectural reading of a fragmentary dedicatory inscription, conserved in the British Museum (''A Guide to the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities in the British Museum'' 84).</ref> and was designed and constructed from around 550 BC by the Cretan [[architect]] [[Chersiphron]] and his son [[Metagenes]]. It was 115&nbsp;m (377&nbsp;ft) long and 46&nbsp;m (151&nbsp;ft) wide, supposedly the first Greek temple built of marble. Its [[peripteral]] columns stood some 13&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) high, in double rows that formed a wide ceremonial passage around the ''[[cella]]'' that housed the goddess's cult image. Thirty-six of these columns were, according to Pliny, decorated by carvings in relief. A new ebony or blackened grapewood [[Cult image|cult statue]] was sculpted by Endoios,<ref>[[Pliny's Natural History]], 16.79.213-16; Pliny's source was the Roman [[Mucianus]], who thought that the cult image by an \"Endoios\" was extremely ancient, however. Endoios' name appears in late 7th-century Attic inscriptions, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] notes works attributed to him. Most importantly, the Ephesians of Mucianus' time maintained the tradition that a particular sculptor had created the remade image {{Harv|LiDonnici|1992|p=398}}.</ref> and a ''[[naiskos]]'' to house it was erected east of the open-air altar.\n\n===Foundation deposit===\n[[File:Triti, Phanes, 625-600 BC, Ionia - 301224.jpg|thumb|The earliest known inscribed [[coin]]age, from the foundation deposit of the Temple of Athena: [[electrum]] coin of [[Phanes (coin issuer)|Phanes]] from [[Ephesus#Archaic period|Ephesus]], 625-600 BC.

[[Pliny the Elder]], seemingly unaware of the ancient continuity of the sacred site, claims that the new temple's architects chose to build it on marshy ground as a precaution against earthquakes.\n\nThe temple became an important attraction, visited by merchants, kings, and sightseers, many of whom paid homage to Artemis in the form of [[jewelry]] and various goods. It also offered sanctuary to those fleeing persecution or punishment, a tradition linked in myth to the Amazons who twice fled there seeking the goddess's protection from punishment, firstly by [[Dionysus]] and later, by [[Heracles]].\n\n===Destruction===\nIn 356 BC, the temple was destroyed in a vainglorious act of arson by a man, [[Herostratus]], who set fire to the wooden roof-beams, seeking fame at any cost; thus the term ''[[Herostratus#In language|herostratic fame]]''.<ref>Valerius Maximus, Memorable deeds and sayings, 8. 14. 5: \"A man was found to plan the burning of the temple of Ephesian Diana so that through the destruction of this most beautiful building his name might be spread through the whole world.\"[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#14.ext.5 Valerius Maximus, VIII.14.ext.5]</ref> For this outrage, the Ephesians sentenced the perpetrator to death and [[damnatio memoriae|forbade anyone from mentioning his name]]; but [[Theopompus]] later noted it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=William|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|year=1849|pages=439|url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1547.html|accessdate=July 21, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202193125/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1547.html|archivedate=February 2, 2007}}</ref> In Greek and Roman historical tradition, the temple's destruction coincided with the birth of [[Alexander the Great]] (around 20/21 July 356 BC). [[Plutarch]] remarked that Artemis was too preoccupied with Alexander's delivery to save her burning temple.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander''.</ref>\n\n==Third phase==\n\nAlexander offered to pay for the temple's rebuilding; the Ephesians tactfully refused, and eventually rebuilt it after his death, at their own expense. Work started in 323 BC and continued for many years. The third temple was larger than the second; 137&nbsp;m (450&nbsp;ft) long by 69&nbsp;m (225&nbsp;ft) wide and 18&nbsp;m (60&nbsp;ft) high, with more than 127 columns.

It was part of a definitively Greek political and cultural identity, essential to the economic life of the region, and an excellent opportunity for young, unmarried Greeks of both sexes to seek out marriage partners.

In Greek cult and myth, Artemis is the twin of [[Apollo]], a virgin huntress who supplanted the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Selene]] as goddess of the [[Moon]]. At Ephesus, a goddess whom the Greeks associated with Artemis was venerated in an archaic, pre-Hellenic [[cult image]]<ref name=\"auto1\">The iconic images have been most thoroughly assembled by Robert Fleischer, ''Artemis von Ephesos und der erwandte Kultstatue von Anatolien und Syrien'' EPRO '''35''' (Leiden: Brill) 1973.</ref> that was carved of wood (a ''[[xoanon]]'') and kept decorated with jewelry. The features are most similar to Near-Eastern and Egyptian deities, and least similar to Greek ones. The body and legs are enclosed within a tapering pillar-like [[Term (architecture)|term]], from which the goddess' feet protrude. On the coins minted at Ephesus, the goddess wears a [[mural crown]] (like a city's walls), an attribute of [[Cybele]] as a protector of cities (see ''[[polos]]'').<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n[[File:Fontana di Diana Efesina-Tivoli, Villa d'Este.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=16th-century fountain of ''Diana Efesina'', at Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Lazio, Italy|Traditional many-breasted interpretation in a 16th-century fountain of ''Diana Efesina'', [[Villa d'Este]], [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]], [[Italy]]]]\nThe traditional interpretation of the oval objects covering the upper part of the Ephesian Artemis is that they represent multiple breasts, symbolizing her fertility. This interpretation began in late antiquity and resulted in designations of the Ephesian goddess as ''Diana Efesia Multimammia'' and other related descriptions.<ref name=Nielsen/> This interpretation was rooted in [[Minucius Felix]] and [[Jerome]]'s Christian attacks on pagan popular religion, and modern scholarship has cast doubt on the traditional interpretation that the statue depicts a many-breasted goddess. Evidence suggests that the oval objects were not intended to depict part of the goddess' anatomy at all. In some versions of the statue, the goddess' skin has been painted black (likely to emulate the aged wood of the original), while her clothes and regalia, including the so-called \"breasts\", were left unpainted or cast in different colors.<ref name=Nielsen/> Robert Fleischer suggested that instead of breasts, the oval objects were decorations that would have been hung ceremonially on the original wood statue (possibly eggs or the scrotal sacs of sacrificed bulls<ref>{{cite journal |last=Seiterle |title=Artemis: die Grosse G\u00f6ttin von Ephesos |journal=Antike Welt |volume=10 |year=1979 |pages=3\u201316 }} accepted in the 1980s by [[Walter Burkert]] and Brita Alroth, among others, criticised and rejected by Robert Fleischer, but widely popularized.</ref>), and which were incorporated as carved features on later copies.<ref name=Nielsen/> The \"breasts\" of the Lady of Ephesus, it now appears, were likely based on [[amber]] gourd-shaped drops, elliptical in cross-section and drilled for hanging, that were rediscovered in the archaeological excavations of 1987\u20131988. These objects remained in place where the ancient wooden statue of the goddess had been caught by an 8th-century flood.

Endoios' name appears in late 7th-century Attic inscriptions, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] notes works attributed to him. Most importantly, the Ephesians of Mucianus' time maintained the tradition that a particular sculptor had created the remade image {{Harv|LiDonnici|1992|p=398}}.</ref> and a ''[[naiskos]]'' to house it was erected east of the open-air altar.\n\n===Foundation deposit===\n[[File:Triti, Phanes, 625-600 BC, Ionia - 301224.jpg|thumb|The earliest known inscribed [[coin]]age, from the foundation deposit of the Temple of Athena: [[electrum]] coin of [[Phanes (coin issuer)|Phanes]] from [[Ephesus#Archaic period|Ephesus]], 625-600 BC.

The features are most similar to Near-Eastern and Egyptian deities, and least similar to Greek ones. The body and legs are enclosed within a tapering pillar-like [[Term (architecture)|term]], from which the goddess' feet protrude.

His mother Kari Marie S\u00f8yland taught at the same school.<ref>[https://www.budstikka.no/kultur/kultur/signerte-pa-hjemmebane/s/2-2.310-1.3500650 Signerte p\u00e5 hjemmebane]</ref> Thanks to his parents, he grew up surrounded by art, science, design and mathematics. [[Renaissance|The European Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque]] in particular were an early inspiration for Vebj\u00f8rn due to the great advancements in art, science, and philosophy during that period.\n\nWhen he was just 16 years old, Vebj\u00f8rn toured [[Norway]] as a caricature artist, and over the course of three summers he painted approximately 3,000 people. It was only after he left high school in [[Fredrikstad]] in 1985, that he started to paint in the classic European tradition and to master his craft, young Vebjorn redrew hundreds of master drawings and copied hundreds of paintings from museums in [[Europe]] and the [[United States|USA]]. Of this period in his life Vebj\u00f8rn said,\n\n''\u201c[Copying the classics] was an excellent way to improve techniques. I knew that the whole secret was hard work; building stone by stone. One small step at a time. I was fanatic about my craft, and I worked like crazy.\"''\n\nVebj\u00f8rn studied under [[:no:Walther Aas|Walther Aas]] and [[:no:Rolf Sch\u00f8nfeld|Rolf Sch\u00f8nfeldt]] from 1983 to 1986, then enrolled in the [[Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts]] where he spent 1986\u201388, and then had a one-year stay at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Prague]]  before returning to the Academy in Oslo, where he left in 1990. He later studied at the [[Art Students League of New York]].<ref>[https://www.wuerth.no/galleri/arrangement/kulturkveld-kunstmaler-vebjorn-sand-en-reise-gjennom-antarktis-hemmeligheter-til-leonardo-da-vincis-visjon/ Vebj\u00f8rn Sand bio via Gallery W\u00fcrth]</ref>\n\nIn 1991 while painting landscapes in [[Valdres]], Vebj\u00f8rn painted his work Okseryggen with oil paint, which gave him turpentine poisoning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/jeg-fikk-synsforstyrrelser-og-kronisk-hodepine-i-mange-ar/60732934|title=Dagbladet article on Vebj\u00f8rn Sand \"- I had visual disturbances and chronic headaches for many years\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Beset by visual disturbances and chronic headaches, Vebj\u00f8rn gave up oil paint and began looking for another outlet for his creative expression.

The castle was designed so that visitors could walk inside the space and experience a frigid atmosphere similar to the one Vebj\u00f8rn did when he painted them.\n\nDuring the first 3 months of its opening in the winter of 1997/98, 180,000 people visited the Troll Castle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/vebjornsand/posts/1301209663245050?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAA5HWpCVlIYd94m7qCJMwXX3HGJmkWdhzTMMHZqDesLpukDKw1qW4PCENE5W8hM8Y1twGG8Co_Bf4AZOnNcfd27QnXAWEB4KYDqJv-FvMW-kxeKTnBUZAAwXvcfBwpUfwSA8RSJU263C-X04968RySSDI9Nbilfxs5u1X4RIPpLNF2z3NpqGzx4ni4Y1QcIQ7T2SUIF5qDYUx9tacvIC5ol3DbcnIpzbAiO5HcYgMxmExmJ2QVGzgqRRFiUtKjyNAOSopwGxDl2Pp_7wyGvX3gbBSjrpLNKm3JwHVkbIT06ufxsmACfKQXMvASmhtthL7NZshxKRyx0Fbl9G-VSZHIrQ&__tn__=-R|title=The Troll Castle notes from the artist Vebj\u00f8rn Sand|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Kepler Star ===\n{{Main|Kepler Object of Interest}}\n[[File:Kepler Star in Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, 2000.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Kepler Star in Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, 2000]]\nVebj\u00f8rn's next public arts project was the Kepler Star, a permanent 45 meter high art installation by the Oslo Airport. Created to honor [[M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res|Doctors Without Borders]] for winning the 1999 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the star itself is based on a design from Johannes Kepler, further combined with an [[icosahedron]] - a [[Kepler\u2013Poinsot polyhedron|polyhedron]] with 20 faces and one of the five platonic bodies, and consists of a skeleton made of steel with crinkled glass. The star sits on three thirty meter high concrete pillars; inspired by the Nunataken in Queen Maud Land Vebj\u00f8rn saw during his expedition to Antarctica in 1996.\n\nSince then, the Kepler Star has seen many uses including being lit pink for breast cancer awareness month in October 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rb.no/lokale_nyheter/article7623562.ece|title=That's why Keplerstjernen is pink|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Leonardo Da Vinci Bridge ===\n{{Main|Vebj\u00f8rn Sand Da Vinci Project}}\nIn 1996, Vebj\u00f8rn saw [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Bridges and Hydraulics|Leonardo da Vinci's sketch]] of a proposed bridge that would cross the Golden Horn \u201cHali\u00e7\u201d in modern-day Turkey. Sketched in 1502 for [[Sultan]] [[Bayezid II]], it would have been 366 m (1,201&nbsp;ft) long, overall and 24&nbsp;m (79&nbsp;ft) wide. Beyazid did not pursue the project, because he believed that such a construction was impossible.\n\nUpon seeing the drawing, Vebj\u00f8rn said \u201cIt was like finding an unplayed symphony of Mozart\u201d and felt compelled to bring it to life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mrt.com/news/article/UTPB-plans-to-build-Da-Vinci-bridge-7546706.php|title=UTPB plans to build Da Vinci bridge|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested the bridge be constructed in Norway, and reached out to the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]] (NPRA).\n\nConstruction began the same year and was completed in 2001. This scaled down version of the da Vinci Bridge now serves as a pedestrian and bike crossing over highway E18, 20 kilometres (12&nbsp;mi) from Oslo, by the nearby village of [[\u00c5s, Akershus|\u00c5s]].\n[[File:The Norwegian Leonardo Bridge Project in \u00c5s, Norway, 2001.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Norwegian Leonardo Bridge Project in \u00c5s, Norway, 2001]]\nAbout Vebj\u00f8rn's ultimate goal with The da Vinci bridge, the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] wrote:\n\n''\u201cHe wanted not only to unite past with present, but also to remind the world that technology is at its best when it is informed with a sense of the transcendental.

The bridge was erected to continue and celebrate the legacy and genius of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces and works that were realized in [[France]]. Clos Luc\u00e9 was Leonardo's residence for his final years before he died in 1519.\n\nLed by Clos Luc\u00e9 officials with the advisement of Vebj\u00f8rn, they brought together 30 professionals working for 3,500 hours to build the bridge. It was designed by Armedieval CCB Compagnons du Devoir, artisan craftsmen and women who specialize in ancient buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vinci-closluce.com/file/press-release-golden-horn-bridge.pdf|title=The Golden Horn Bridge|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Arrival in New York ===\n[[File:Galleri Sand's Tribeca Studio in NYC.jpg|alt=|thumb|Galleri Sand's Tribeca Studio in NYC]]In order to explore the international art scene and to refine his technical skills Vebj\u00f8rn left Norway for New York in 2000 and studied at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Enjoying and finding freedom in the New York art scene, he rented a studio in [[Tribeca]], in lower Manhattan where he rededicated himself to painting.\n\n=== Becoming a man ===\nIn 2008, Vebj\u00f8rn began work on a series of paintings that examined modern Western masculine ideals, those that \u201conly address ego, greed, and ambition.

In Vebj\u00f8rn's introduction to the project he points out that while there are [[List of World War II films|many movies]] and books made of the war, there are little to no paintings or artwork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scenesfromthesecondworldwar.com/essays|title=Scenes from the Second World War - Exhibition by Vebj\u00f8rn Sand {{!}} Essays|website=www.scenesfromthesecondworldwar.com|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref> Inspired to examine the human side of the conflict, Vebj\u00f8rn aimed to ask these questions with ''Scenes:'' \u201cHow could civilization collapse so completely? And: what does it mean to be a human being?\u201d\n[[File:\u201cBreakfast (Banality of Evil)\u201d Scenes from the Second World War (2011) (48207435587).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|\"Breakfast (Banality of Evil)\", ''Scenes from the Second World War'' (2011)]]\nRather than depict bloody scenes and horrors, Vebj\u00f8rn opted for singular moments in the war, such as ''A Scene from Wannsee,'' the secret Nazi conference in which the \u201c[[Final Solution]] to the Jewish question\u201d was decided January 1942, to the ''Nuremburg Trials'' to the myth of [[Josef Schulz]], the German soldier who was supposedly shot by his comrades when he refused to execute prisoners in Yugoslavia. While the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] was not the main focus of the paintings, Vebj\u00f8rn's acute paintbrush brought the horror to life in both the composite scenes and individuals. Reflecting on the core message of ''Scenes'', Vebj\u00f8rn said:\n[[File:\u201cThe Story of Josef Schultz\u201d Scenes from the Second World War (2011) (48207435352).jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|\u201cThe Story of Josef Schulz\u201d, ''Scenes from the Second World War'' (2011)]]\n''\u201cWorld War II shows that we were both angels and demons.

Noted New York critic [[Donald Kuspit]], impressed with the exhibition, advised Vebj\u00f8rn to bring the exhibition to Germany. But after contacting German curators, Kuspit was informed that none of the galleries could showcase Vebj\u00f8rn's work''.''

While cities in Spain had been bombed by the Germans earlier in the war, Guernica was unique because it was both a military experiment conducted against a defenseless civilian population, and it left the city totally destroyed. Fewer than one percent of the buildings were left unscathed and while the official death toll was 1,654, many more were left forever buried under the ruins.\n\nThe attack was made infamous by artist [[Pablo Picasso]] after the war in his seminal painting \u201c[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]\u201d. To Vebj\u00f8rn, however, he found that Picasso's work had grown to overshadow the very event itself:\n\n\u201c''- Picasso's painting really stands in the way of Guernica's turning point. It has become more famous than the city itself and what happened. It is iconic as a picture of war and terror, but with all due respect to Picasso, Guernica is so much more than what one sees in his great, famous painting,''\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/ostfold/vebjorn-sand-har-brukt-tre-ar-pa-sin-storste-utstilling-1.13482869|title=Sand about new war art: - The best thing I've done|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWith ''Guernica'', Vebj\u00f8rn vowed to bring the history of the attack to the forefront with an entirely human perspective.

First he used ice to reinterpret and construct a new bridge during his expedition to Queen Maud Land in Antarctica. After that, in December of 2007, Vebj\u00f8rn erected a temporary ice bridge to dramatize the melting [[glacier]]s of Antarctica due to climate change outside of the [[United Nations]] Plaza in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environment-climate-un-ice-bridge-dc/u-n-ice-bridge-reminder-of-melting-antarctica-idUSN1743109620071218|title=U.N. ice bridge reminder of melting Antarctica|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> During the unveiling at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|U.N.

The one outside the United Nations is intended to melt to show that Antarctica is melting.''\u201d\n\nThe bridge was unveiled earlier that year two days after nearly 200 nations agreed at the U.N.-led talks in [[Bali]] to launch negotiations on a new pact to fight global warming.\n\nIn 2009, Vebj\u00f8rn built another ice bridge in [[Ilulissat|Ilulissat, Greenland]] (where most icebergs are borne into the sea). Later that year in [[Copenhagen]], as part of the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]], also known as COP15, Vebj\u00f8rn constructed yet another ice bridge in front of the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]] to raise global awareness of climate change.\n\n== Personal life ==\nVebj\u00f8rn grew up in [[Hvaler]], Norway with his 4 siblings.

The bridge was erected to continue and celebrate the legacy and genius of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces and works that were realized in [[France]]. Clos Luc\u00e9 was Leonardo's residence for his final years before he died in 1519.\n\nLed by Clos Luc\u00e9 officials with the advisement of Vebj\u00f8rn, they brought together 30 professionals working for 3,500 hours to build the bridge. It was designed by Armedieval CCB Compagnons du Devoir, artisan craftsmen and women who specialize in ancient buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vinci-closluce.com/file/press-release-golden-horn-bridge.pdf|title=The Golden Horn Bridge|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Arrival in New York ===\n[[File:Galleri Sand's Tribeca Studio in NYC.jpg|alt=|thumb|Galleri Sand's Tribeca Studio in NYC]]In order to explore the international art scene and to refine his technical skills Vebj\u00f8rn left Norway for New York in 2000 and studied at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Enjoying and finding freedom in the New York art scene, he rented a studio in [[Tribeca]], in lower Manhattan where he rededicated himself to painting.\n\n=== Becoming a man ===\nIn 2008, Vebj\u00f8rn began work on a series of paintings that examined modern Western masculine ideals, those that \u201conly address ego, greed, and ambition. It is an absence of visions beyond themselves.\u201d he said.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/osloby/byliv/i/75n58/En-Sand-mann|title=A Sand man|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nInspired by the work of American poet [[Robert Bly]], he looked deeply into the lost initiation rights that helped channel budding masculinity into adulthood, and our youth centered culture, what Bly called the \u201c[[The Sibling Society|Sibling Society]]\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/i/z7PQr/A-bli-mann|title=To become a man|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ''Becoming A Man'' debuted in May 2008 at Galleri Sand.\n\n=== ''Scenes from the Second World War'' and international breakthrough ===\n\nIn 2011, Vebj\u00f8rn began painting his series ''Scenes from the Second World War,'' a collection of paintings focused on [[World War II|WWII]]. In Vebj\u00f8rn's introduction to the project he points out that while there are [[List of World War II films|many movies]] and books made of the war, there are little to no paintings or artwork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scenesfromthesecondworldwar.com/essays|title=Scenes from the Second World War - Exhibition by Vebj\u00f8rn Sand {{!}} Essays|website=www.scenesfromthesecondworldwar.com|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref> Inspired to examine the human side of the conflict, Vebj\u00f8rn aimed to ask these questions with ''Scenes:'' \u201cHow could civilization collapse so completely? And: what does it mean to be a human being?\u201d\n[[File:\u201cBreakfast (Banality of Evil)\u201d Scenes from the Second World War (2011) (48207435587).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|\"Breakfast (Banality of Evil)\", ''Scenes from the Second World War'' (2011)]]\nRather than depict bloody scenes and horrors, Vebj\u00f8rn opted for singular moments in the war, such as ''A Scene from Wannsee,'' the secret Nazi conference in which the \u201c[[Final Solution]] to the Jewish question\u201d was decided January 1942, to the ''Nuremburg Trials'' to the myth of [[Josef Schulz]], the German soldier who was supposedly shot by his comrades when he refused to execute prisoners in Yugoslavia. While the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] was not the main focus of the paintings, Vebj\u00f8rn's acute paintbrush brought the horror to life in both the composite scenes and individuals. Reflecting on the core message of ''Scenes'', Vebj\u00f8rn said:\n[[File:\u201cThe Story of Josef Schultz\u201d Scenes from the Second World War (2011) (48207435352).jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|\u201cThe Story of Josef Schulz\u201d, ''Scenes from the Second World War'' (2011)]]\n''\u201cWorld War II shows that we were both angels and demons.

Part Two opened on May 3, 2012 with several new large canvases being added. The exhibition received both praise from several art critics and high-profile sales, including 3 to American art collector Raymond J. Learsy and his wife [[Melva Bucksbaum]] for over a quarter of a million dollars or 2.1 million [[Norwegian krone|Norwegian Krone]] and 1 to an anonymous American newspaper publisher for upwards of 1 million kroner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/ostfold/nytt-millionsalg-for-vebjorn-sand-1.12225293|title=Two new million sales for Sand|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe 22 painting series was not without controversy, however. Noted New York critic [[Donald Kuspit]], impressed with the exhibition, advised Vebj\u00f8rn to bring the exhibition to Germany. But after contacting German curators, Kuspit was informed that none of the galleries could showcase Vebj\u00f8rn's work''.''

Several of the paintings have a gripping content and are painstakingly conveyed.\u201d''\n\n=== ''Guernica: A Turning Point'' ===\nAfter ''Scenes,'' Vebj\u00f8rn, still thoroughly captivated with the human stories and grand scale horror of World War II, began painting his next exhibition, ''Guernica: A Turning Point'' in early 2014.\n[[File:\"Sister Anna\", Guernica, A Turning Point (2017).jpg|thumb|\"Sister Anna\", ''Guernica: A Turning Point'' (2017)]]\nThe series focused on the Germans\u2019 [[Bombing of Guernica|brutal attack]] on the Spanish city of Guernica during the [[Spanish Civil War]] in April 1937 that first introduced the concept of \u201c[[Carpet bombing|Carpet Bombing]]\u201d. While cities in Spain had been bombed by the Germans earlier in the war, Guernica was unique because it was both a military experiment conducted against a defenseless civilian population, and it left the city totally destroyed. Fewer than one percent of the buildings were left unscathed and while the official death toll was 1,654, many more were left forever buried under the ruins.\n\nThe attack was made infamous by artist [[Pablo Picasso]] after the war in his seminal painting \u201c[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]\u201d. To Vebj\u00f8rn, however, he found that Picasso's work had grown to overshadow the very event itself:\n\n\u201c''- Picasso's painting really stands in the way of Guernica's turning point. It has become more famous than the city itself and what happened. It is iconic as a picture of war and terror, but with all due respect to Picasso, Guernica is so much more than what one sees in his great, famous painting,''\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/ostfold/vebjorn-sand-har-brukt-tre-ar-pa-sin-storste-utstilling-1.13482869|title=Sand about new war art: - The best thing I've done|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWith ''Guernica'', Vebj\u00f8rn vowed to bring the history of the attack to the forefront with an entirely human perspective. After reading as much source material as he could, speaking with and meeting several [[historian]]s of the attack, including Luis Iriondo who witnessed it in person at age 14, Vebj\u00f8rn created nearly 70 unique paintings for the exhibit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/a-survivor-remembers-the-horror-of-the-guernica-bombing-a-830023.html|title=A Survivor Recalls the Horrors of Guernica|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://magasinetkunst.no/2017/04/03/guernica-ondskapens-banalitet/|title=Guernica and the banality of evil|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n80 years after the original attack and 3 years after beginning the project, Vebj\u00f8rn exhibited ''Guernica: A Turning Point'' in Oslo on April 26, 2017.

A longstanding critic of the Norwegian cultural authority, Vebj\u00f8rn said of the art scene:\n\n''\"Since the late 60's and the beginning of the 70's, the art politics has been dominated by the modernist and \u2018lefties\u2019.

First he used ice to reinterpret and construct a new bridge during his expedition to Queen Maud Land in Antarctica. After that, in December of 2007, Vebj\u00f8rn erected a temporary ice bridge to dramatize the melting [[glacier]]s of Antarctica due to climate change outside of the [[United Nations]] Plaza in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environment-climate-un-ice-bridge-dc/u-n-ice-bridge-reminder-of-melting-antarctica-idUSN1743109620071218|title=U.N. ice bridge reminder of melting Antarctica|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> During the unveiling at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|U.N.

So to erect it on that glacier, and that part of Antarctica, (it) must never melt. The one outside the United Nations is intended to melt to show that Antarctica is melting.''\u201d\n\nThe bridge was unveiled earlier that year two days after nearly 200 nations agreed at the U.N.-led talks in [[Bali]] to launch negotiations on a new pact to fight global warming.\n\nIn 2009, Vebj\u00f8rn built another ice bridge in [[Ilulissat|Ilulissat, Greenland]] (where most icebergs are borne into the sea). Later that year in [[Copenhagen]], as part of the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]], also known as COP15, Vebj\u00f8rn constructed yet another ice bridge in front of the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]] to raise global awareness of climate change.\n\n== Personal life ==\nVebj\u00f8rn grew up in [[Hvaler]], Norway with his 4 siblings.

It can also refer to executive vice presidents, signifying that the vice president is on the executive branch of the government, university or company.

In everyday speech, the abbreviation ''VP'' can be used.\n\n==In government==\n{{see also|List of current vice presidents}}\n\nIn [[government]], a vice president is a person whose primary responsibility is to act in place of the [[President (government title)|president]] on the event of the president's death, resignation or incapacity. Vice presidents are either elected jointly with the president as their [[running mate]], or more rarely, appointed independently after the president's election.\n\nMost governments with vice presidents have one person in this role at any time, although in some countries there are two or more vice presidents\u2013an extreme case being Iran's [[Vice President of Iran|12 vice presidents]]. If the president is not present, dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to fulfill their duties, the vice president will generally serve as president. In many [[presidential system]]s, the vice president does not wield much day-to-day political power, but is still considered an important member of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Some vice presidents in the [[Americas]] hold the position of [[President of the Senate]]; this is the case, for example, in [[Argentina]], the [[United States]], and [[Uruguay]].
