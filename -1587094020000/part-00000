{"title_page": "Hypernova", "text_new": "{{short description|A supernova which ejects a large mass at unusually high velocity}}\n\n[[File:SN 1998bw.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] image of hypernova [[SN 1998bw]] in a spiral arm of galaxy ESO 184-G82]]\nA '''hypernova''' is a type of [[stellar explosion]] which ejects material with an unusually high [[kinetic energy]], an order of magnitude higher than most [[supernova]]e.  They usually appear similar to a [[type Ic supernova]], but with unusually broad spectral lines indicating an extremely high expansion velocity.  Hypernovae are one of the mechanisms for producing long [[Gamma ray burst|gamma ray bursts (GRBs)]], which range from 2 seconds to over a minute in duration.\n\n==History==\n\nIn the 1980s, the term ''hypernova'' was used to describe a theoretical type of supernova now known as a [[pair-instability supernova]].  It referred to the extremely high energy of the explosion compared to typical [[core collapse supernova]]e.<ref name=ww1982/><ref name=janka2012/><ref name=gass1988/>  The term had previously been used to describe hypothetical explosions from diverse events such as [[hyperstar]]s, extremely massive [[population III]] stars in the early universe,<ref name=barrington1963/> or from events such as [[black hole]] mergers.<ref name=park1991/>\n\nGRBs were initially detected on July 2, 1967 by US military satellites in high orbit, which were meant to detect gamma radiation. The US had suspected the [[USSR]] of conducting secret nuclear tests despite signing the [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963, and the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela]] satellites were capable of detecting explosions behind the [[moon]]. The satellites detected a signal, but it was unlike that of a nuclear weapon signature, nor could it be correlated to solar flares.<ref name=katz2002/>  Over the next few decades, the GRBs posed a compelling mystery. Gamma rays require highly energetic events to be produced, yet GRBs could not be correlated to supernovae, solar flares, or any other activity in the sky. Their brevity made them difficult to trace. Once their direction could be determined, it was found that they were evenly spread across the sky. Thus they were not originating in the Milky Way or nearby galaxies, but from deep space.\n\nIn February 1997, Dutch-Italian satellite [[BeppoSAX]] was able to trace [[GRB 970508]] to a faint galaxy roughly 6 billion light years away.<ref name=bloom1998/> From analyzing the spectroscopic data for both the GRB 970508 and its host galaxy, Bloom et al. concluded in 1998 that a hypernova was the likely cause.<ref name=bloom1998/> That same year, hypernovae were hypothesized in greater detail by Polish astronomer [[Bohdan Paczy\u0144ski]] as supernovae from rapidly-spinning stars.<ref name=paczynski1997/>\n \nThe usage of the term ''hypernova'' from the late 20th century has since been refined to refer to those supernovae with unusually large kinetic energy.<ref name=stevenson2013/>  The first hypernova observed was [[SN 1998bw]], with a luminosity 100 times higher than a standard Type Ib.<ref name=woosley1999/>  This supernova was the first to be associated with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and it produced a shockwave containing an order of magnitude more energy than a normal supernova.  Other scientists prefer to call these objects simply broad-lined [[type Ic supernova]]e.<ref name=moriya2018/>  Since then the term has been applied to a variety of objects, not all of them meeting the standard definition, for example [[ASASSN-15lh]].<ref name=orwig2016/>\n\n==Properties==\nHypernovae are now widely accepted to be supernovae with ejecta having a kinetic energy larger than about {{val|e=52|ul=erg}}, an order of magnitude higher than a typical core collapse supernova.  The ejected nickel masses are large and the ejection velocity up to 99% of the [[speed of light]].  These are typically of type Ic, and some are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts.  The electromagnetic energy released by these events varies from comparable to other type Ic supernova, to some of the most luminous supernovae known such as [[SN 1999as]].<ref name=nomoto2003/><ref name=mazzali2005/>\n\nThe archetypal hypernova SN 1998bw was associated with [[GRB 980425]].  Its spectrum showed no hydrogen and no clear helium features, but strong silicon lines identified it as a type Ic supernova.  The main [[absorption line]]s were extremely broadened and the light curve showed a very rapid brightening phase, reaching the brightness of a [[type Ia supernova]] at day 16.  The total ejected mass was about {{solar mass|10}} and the mass of nickel ejected about {{solar mass|0.4}}.<ref name=nomoto2003/>  All supernovae associated with GRBs have shown the high-energy ejecta that characterises them as hypernovae.<ref name=mosta2014/>\n\nUnusually bright [[radio supernova]]e have been observed as counterparts to hypernovae, and have been termed radio hypernovae.<ref name=nakuchi2015/>\n\n==Astrophysical models ==\nModels for hypernova focus on the efficient transfer of energy into the ejecta.  In normal [[core collapse supernova]]e, 99% of neutrinos generated in the collapsing core escape without driving the ejection of material.  It is thought that rotation of the supernova progenitor drives a jet that accelerates material away from the explosion at close to the speed of light.  Binary systems are increasingly being studied as the best method for both stripping stellar envelopes to leave a bare carbon-oxygen core, and for inducing the necessary spin conditions to drive a hypernova.\n\n===Collapsar model===\n{{for|a completely collapsed star|stellar black hole}}\nThe collapsar model describes a type of supernova that produces a gravitationally collapsed object, or [[black hole]]. The word \"collapsar\", short for \"collapsed [[star]]\", was formerly used to refer to the end product of stellar [[gravitational collapse]], a [[stellar black hole|stellar-mass black hole]]. The word is now sometimes used to refer to a specific model for the collapse of a fast-rotating star. When core collapse occurs in a star with a core at least around fifteen times the [[Solar mass|sun's mass]] ({{Solar mass}})\u2014though chemical composition and rotational rate are also significant\u2014the explosion energy is insufficient to expel the outer layers of the star, and it will collapse into a black hole without producing a visible supernova outburst.\n\nA star with a core mass slightly below this level\u2014in the range of {{Solar mass|5\u201315}}\u2014will undergo a supernova explosion, but so much of the ejected mass falls back onto the core remnant that it still collapses into a black hole. If such a star is rotating slowly, then it will produce a faint supernova, but if the star is rotating quickly enough, then the fallback to the black hole will produce [[Astrophysical jet|relativistic jets]]. The energy that these jets transfer into the ejected shell renders the visible outburst substantially more luminous than a standard supernova. The jets also beam high energy particles and gamma rays directly outward and thereby produce x-ray or gamma-ray bursts; the jets can last for several seconds or longer and correspond to long-duration gamma-ray bursts, but they do not appear to explain short-duration gamma-ray bursts.<ref name=nomoto2009/><ref name=fujimoto2008/>\n\n===Binary models===\nThe mechanism for producing the stripped progenitor, a carbon-oxygen star lacking any significant hydrogen or helium, of type Ic supernovae was once thought to be an extremely evolved massive star, for example a type WO [[Wolf-Rayet star]] whose dense [[stellar wind]] expelled all its outer layers.  Observations have failed to detect any such progenitors.  It is still not conclusively shown that the progenitors are actually a different type of object, but several cases suggest that lower-mass \"helium giants\" are the progenitors.  These stars are not sufficiently massive to expel their envelopes simply by stellar winds, and they would be stripped by mass transfer to a binary companion.  Helium giants are increasingly favoured as the progenitors of type Ib supernovae, but the progenitors of type Ic supernovae is still uncertain.<ref name=tauris2013/>\n\nOne proposed mechanism for producing gamma-ray bursts is induced gravitational collapse, where a [[neutron star]] is triggered to collapse into a [[black hole]] by the core collapse of a close companion consisting of a stripped carbon-oxygen core.  The induced neutron star collapse allows for the formation of jets and high-energy ejecta that have been difficult to model from a single star.<ref name=ruffini2018/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Astronomy}}\n* {{annotated link|Gamma-ray burst progenitors}}\n* {{annotated link|Quark star}}\n* {{annotated link|Quark-nova}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=stevenson2013>{{cite book|author=David S.

They usually appear similar to a [[type Ic supernova]], but with unusually broad spectral lines indicating an extremely high expansion velocity.  Hypernovae are one of the mechanisms for producing long [[Gamma ray burst|gamma ray bursts (GRBs)]], which range from 2 seconds to over a minute in duration.\n\n==History==\n\nIn the 1980s, the term ''hypernova'' was used to describe a theoretical type of supernova now known as a [[pair-instability supernova]].  It referred to the extremely high energy of the explosion compared to typical [[core collapse supernova]]e.<ref name=ww1982/><ref name=janka2012/><ref name=gass1988/>  The term had previously been used to describe hypothetical explosions from diverse events such as [[hyperstar]]s, extremely massive [[population III]] stars in the early universe,<ref name=barrington1963/> or from events such as [[black hole]] mergers.<ref name=park1991/>\n\nGRBs were initially detected on July 2, 1967 by US military satellites in high orbit, which were meant to detect gamma radiation. The US had suspected the [[USSR]] of conducting secret nuclear tests despite signing the [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963, and the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela]] satellites were capable of detecting explosions behind the [[moon]]. The satellites detected a signal, but it was unlike that of a nuclear weapon signature, nor could it be correlated to solar flares.<ref name=katz2002/>  Over the next few decades, the GRBs posed a compelling mystery. Gamma rays require highly energetic events to be produced, yet GRBs could not be correlated to supernovae, solar flares, or any other activity in the sky. Their brevity made them difficult to trace. Once their direction could be determined, it was found that they were evenly spread across the sky. Thus they were not originating in the Milky Way or nearby galaxies, but from deep space.\n\nIn February 1997, Dutch-Italian satellite [[BeppoSAX]] was able to trace [[GRB 970508]] to a faint galaxy roughly 6 billion light years away.<ref name=bloom1998/> From analyzing the spectroscopic data for both the GRB 970508 and its host galaxy, Bloom et al. concluded in 1998 that a hypernova was the likely cause.<ref name=bloom1998/> That same year, hypernovae were hypothesized in greater detail by Polish astronomer [[Bohdan Paczy\u0144ski]] as supernovae from rapidly-spinning stars.<ref name=paczynski1997/>\n \nThe usage of the term ''hypernova'' from the late 20th century has since been refined to refer to those supernovae with unusually large kinetic energy.<ref name=stevenson2013/>  The first hypernova observed was [[SN 1998bw]], with a luminosity 100 times higher than a standard Type Ib.<ref name=woosley1999/>  This supernova was the first to be associated with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and it produced a shockwave containing an order of magnitude more energy than a normal supernova.  Other scientists prefer to call these objects simply broad-lined [[type Ic supernova]]e.<ref name=moriya2018/>  Since then the term has been applied to a variety of objects, not all of them meeting the standard definition, for example [[ASASSN-15lh]].<ref name=orwig2016/>\n\n==Properties==\nHypernovae are now widely accepted to be supernovae with ejecta having a kinetic energy larger than about {{val|e=52|ul=erg}}, an order of magnitude higher than a typical core collapse supernova.  The ejected nickel masses are large and the ejection velocity up to 99% of the [[speed of light]].  These are typically of type Ic, and some are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts.  The electromagnetic energy released by these events varies from comparable to other type Ic supernova, to some of the most luminous supernovae known such as [[SN 1999as]].<ref name=nomoto2003/><ref name=mazzali2005/>\n\nThe archetypal hypernova SN 1998bw was associated with [[GRB 980425]].  Its spectrum showed no hydrogen and no clear helium features, but strong silicon lines identified it as a type Ic supernova.  The main [[absorption line]]s were extremely broadened and the light curve showed a very rapid brightening phase, reaching the brightness of a [[type Ia supernova]] at day 16.  The total ejected mass was about {{solar mass|10}} and the mass of nickel ejected about {{solar mass|0.4}}.<ref name=nomoto2003/>  All supernovae associated with GRBs have shown the high-energy ejecta that characterises them as hypernovae.<ref name=mosta2014/>\n\nUnusually bright [[radio supernova]]e have been observed as counterparts to hypernovae, and have been termed radio hypernovae.<ref name=nakuchi2015/>\n\n==Astrophysical models ==\nModels for hypernova focus on the efficient transfer of energy into the ejecta.  In normal [[core collapse supernova]]e, 99% of neutrinos generated in the collapsing core escape without driving the ejection of material.  It is thought that rotation of the supernova progenitor drives a jet that accelerates material away from the explosion at close to the speed of light.  Binary systems are increasingly being studied as the best method both for stripped of stellar envelopes to leave a bare carbon-oxygen core, and for inducing the necessary spin conditions to drive a hypernova.\n\n===Collapsar model===\n{{for|a completely collapsed star|stellar black hole}}\nThe collapsar model describes a type of supernova that produces a gravitationally collapsed object, or [[black hole]]. The word \"collapsar\", short for \"collapsed [[star]]\", was formerly used to refer to the end product of stellar [[gravitational collapse]], a [[stellar black hole|stellar-mass black hole]]. The word is now sometimes used to refer to a specific model for the collapse of a fast-rotating star. When core collapse occurs in a star with a core at least around fifteen times the [[Solar mass|sun's mass]] ({{Solar mass}})\u2014though chemical composition and rotational rate are also significant\u2014the explosion energy is insufficient to expel the outer layers of the star, and it will collapse into a black hole without producing a visible supernova outburst.\n\nA star with a core mass slightly below this level\u2014in the range of {{Solar mass|5\u201315}}\u2014will undergo a supernova explosion, but so much of the ejected mass falls back onto the core remnant that it still collapses into a black hole. If such a star is rotating slowly, then it will produce a faint supernova, but if the star is rotating quickly enough, then the fallback to the black hole will produce [[Astrophysical jet|relativistic jets]]. The energy that these jets transfer into the ejected shell renders the visible outburst substantially more luminous than a standard supernova. The jets also beam high energy particles and gamma rays directly outward and thereby produce x-ray or gamma-ray bursts; the jets can last for several seconds or longer and correspond to long-duration gamma-ray bursts, but they do not appear to explain short-duration gamma-ray bursts.<ref name=nomoto2009/><ref name=fujimoto2008/>\n\n===Binary models===\nThe mechanism for producing the stripped progenitor, a carbon-oxygen star lacking any significant hydrogen or helium, of type Ic supernovae was once thought to be an extremely evolved massive star, for example a type WO [[Wolf-Rayet star]] whose dense [[stellar wind]] expelled all its outer layers.  Observations have failed to detect any such progenitors.  It is still not conclusively shown that the progenitors are actually a different type of object, but several cases suggest that lower-mass \"helium giants\" are the progenitors.  These stars are not sufficiently massive to expel their envelopes simply by stellar winds, and they would be stripped by mass transfer to a binary companion.  Helium giants are increasingly favoured as the progenitors of type Ib supernovae, but the progenitors of type Ic supernovae is still uncertain.<ref name=tauris2013/>\n\nOne proposed mechanism for producing gamma-ray bursts is induced gravitational collapse, where a [[neutron star]] is triggered to collapse into a [[black hole]] by the core collapse of a close companion consisting of a stripped carbon-oxygen core.  The induced neutron star collapse allows for the formation of jets and high-energy ejecta that have been difficult to model from a single star.<ref name=ruffini2018/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Astronomy}}\n* {{annotated link|Gamma-ray burst progenitors}}\n* {{annotated link|Quark star}}\n* {{annotated link|Quark-nova}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=stevenson2013>{{cite book|author=David S.

It was established in 1921, at the suggestion of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and named after the independence activist [[Lokmanya Tilak]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe origin of the Vidyapeeth dates back to 1921, when immediately after the demise of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, his follower Mahatma Gandhi mooted the idea of establishing a university in his memory. One of the postulates of the four-fold formula conceived by Lokmanya Tilak was National Education and the other three were Swaraj, Swadeshi and Boycott. The delegates of the first Maharashtra Provincial Conference on 6 May 1921, under the presidency of Shrimat Shankaracharya of Karveer Peeth, decided to have National University in Maharashtra. Thus, the present-day Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth (TMV) was established.\n\nTMV is a public-funded university, that had scholar Shri Shankaracharya Vidyashankar Bharati (alias Dr. Kurtakoti) as its first chancellor. This post has been held by other personalities such as the Sanskrit scholar Bharatacharya Shri. C. V. Vaidya, the first premier of Bombay Presidency Shri. B. G. Kher, Dr. M. S. alias Lokanayak Bapusaheb Aney, a great Sanskrit scholar and a historian Maha Mahopadhyay Datto Vaman Potdar, and Honorable Shri. Y. B. Chavan, Shri. S. B. Chavan, Shri. Shivraj Patil, Shri. Sushilkumar Shinde \u2014 all Union Home Ministers.\n\nDuring the pre-independence period, degrees awarded in the faculties of Arts, Management, Commerce and Engineering as well as the research works in Sanskrit and Ayurveda were world acclaimed and recognized.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Similarly, in the post-independence period, the degrees of Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth were equivalent to the degrees of other statutory universities.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThough late, in the year 1987 the University Grants Commission took cognizance of significant work of TMV in the fields of Sanskrit, Ayurveda, Social Sciences and Distance Education. Thereby, on its recommendations, the Government of India conferred the \"Deemed to be University\" status upon Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth. With the conferment of this status, the Vidyapeeth gained recognition at national level. Since November 2015 Vidyapeeth has got 'B grade' by NAAC.<ref>http://www.naac.gov.in/docs/deemed%20university%20result.pdf</ref>\n\nThe concept of non-formal education was first discussed at national level in 1985 and thereby the TMV contributed to this national vision by launching a distance education course (B.B.A.). TMV takes pride that the distance education program was launched before the establishment of IGNOU at national level and YCMOU at state level.\n\nWith the conferment of \"Deemed to be University\" status in 1987 the Vidyapeeth received its first financial assistance for the development of campus during the last phase of VIII Plan. Simultaneously, the State Government sanctioned salary component for few teaching (17) and non-teaching posts (52). Since then the Vidyapeeth has received financial support for development/research purpose from UGC/State Government.

It was established in 1921, at the suggestion of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and named after the independence activist [[Lokmanya Tilak]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe origin of the Vidyapeeth dates back to 1921 when, immediately after the demise of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, his follower Mahatma Gandhi mooted the idea of establishing a university in his memory. One of the postulates of the four-fold formula conceived by Lokmanya Tilak was National Education and the other three were Swaraj, Swadeshi and Boycott. The delegates of the first Maharashtra Provincial Conference on 6 May 1921 under the presidency of Shrimat Shankaracharya of Karveer Peeth decided to have National University in Maharashtra. Thus the present-day Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth (TMV) was established.\n\nTMV is a public-funded university, that had scholar Shri Shankaracharya Vidyashankar Bharati (alias Dr. Kurtakoti) as its first chancellor. This post has been held by other personalities such as the Sanskrit scholar Bharatacharya Shri. C. V. Vaidya, the first premier of Bombay Presidency Shri. B. G. Kher, Dr. M. S. alias Lokanayak Bapusaheb Aney, a great Sanskrit scholar and a historian Maha Mahopadhyay Datto Vaman Potdar, and Honorable Shri. Y. B. Chavan, Shri. S. B. Chavan, Shri. Shivraj Patil, Shri. Sushilkumar Shinde \u2014 all Union Home Ministers.\n\nDuring the pre-independence period, degrees awarded in the faculties of Arts, Management, Commerce and Engineering as well as the research works in Sanskrit and Ayurveda were world acclaimed and recognized.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Similarly, in the post-independence period, the degrees of Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth were equivalent to the degrees of other statutory universities.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThough late, in the year 1987 that the University Grants Commission took cognizance of significant work of TMV in the fields of Sanskrit, Ayurveda, Social Sciences and Distance Education. Thereby, on its recommendations, the Government of India conferred the \"Deemed to be University\" status upon Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth. With the conferment of this status, the Vidyapeeth gained recognition at national level. Since November 2015 Vidyapeeth has got 'B grade' by NAAC.<ref>http://www.naac.gov.in/docs/deemed%20university%20result.pdf</ref>\n\nThe concept of non-formal education was first discussed at national level in 1985 and thereby the TMV contributed to this national vision by launching a distance education course (B.B.A.). TMV takes pride that the distance education program was launched before the establishment of IGNOU at national level and YCMOU at state level.\n\nWith the conferment of \"Deemed to be University\" status in 1987 the Vidyapeeth received its first financial assistance for the development of campus during the last phase of VIII Plan. Simultaneously, the State Government sanctioned salary component for few teaching (17) and non-teaching posts (52). Since then the Vidyapeeth has received financial support for development/research purpose from UGC/State Government. It is to be noted that for smooth and efficient functioning of the Vidyapeeth, requisite teaching and non-teaching staff were employed from its own funds.\n\nConsiderable research work has been conducted by the faculties of Sanskrit, Social Sciences and Ayurveda with its respective prime focus on \u2014\n\n\u2022 promotion and protection of our great Indian heritage and tradition through the study of Sanskrit \u2014 the original source of all Indian languages and Sanskrit sources of Indian history;\n\n\u2022 application of innovative concept of interdisciplinary approach to emerging social issues and challenges; to create awareness among deprived sections of society;\n\n\u2022 impart ayurvedic knowledge of preventive medicine and positive health to the masses in context of oral prescriptions, study of manuscripts for trends in drugs and clinical trials.\n\nIn the year 2000, the Distance Education Council (DEC), New Delhi gave its recognition and offered financial assistance for distance education programmes.\n\nBy 2004 there was a boom in the fields of computer and management. Thereby, the student strength of the Vidyapeeth for courses in these fields increased. Now with prime focus on its core fields \u2014 i.e., Sanskrit, Ayurveda, Social Sciences \u2014 intact, Vidyapeeth re-oriented itself to offer new courses that cater to the student community and meet the demands of industrial sector by seeking requisite approvals from statutory councils \u2013 NCTE / AICTE / INC / MSCOTP / MSBTE and BCI the Vidyapeeth launched B.Ed. & M.Ed. / BHMCT / B.Sc.
