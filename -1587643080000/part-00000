It is governed by an elected ten-member Board of Directors (with 2 elected alternates). There are seven staff positions within the organization. Staff positions traditionally include a General Manager, an Operations Manager, an Assistant Manager, A Site and Facilities Manager, a Residential Caretaker, a Groundskeeper, and an Administrative Assistant. Currently the fair does not have a General Manager. Until a full-time General Manager is hired by the Board of Directors, the Site and Facilities Manager and Operations Manager share management responsibilities and authority within the organization. \n\n\nAlter-abled access is available at the Oregon Country Fair, including wheelchairs (there is a battery re-charging station for electric wheelchairs), helpers, sign language interpreters, folding chairs, rest areas, maps, and other information. To obtain these services, or more information about them, event participants can go to the following locations on the event site: the ''Alter-Abled Access Advocates(4A)Center'' (located near Admissions as well as at the Bus Stop), ''Community Village'', ''Solutions'', and all ''Information booths''.<ref name=\"oregoncountryfair.org\">http://www.oregoncountryfair.org</ref>\n\nFrom June 1  through August 31 there are no dogs (except service dogs) allowed on the event site.<ref name=\"oregoncountryfair.org\"/>\n\n'''Publications'''\n\nThe Oregon Country Fair publishes a newsletter, the Fair Family News, eleven times a year.  As well as an event paper, the Peach Pit, once a year for the three-day event.<ref name=\"oregoncountryfair.org\"/>\n\n==Volunteer crews==\nThe Oregon Country Fair has a large volunteer network. This volunteer network is the base for all operational needs of the event. While some working volunteers receive food vouchers, which can be used to buy meals from vendors during the event, many volunteers do not. Volunteer crews are separated into \"Pre-fair Crews\" and \"During Fair Crews.\" Pre-fair crews work from the site's opening in early June until the event officially opens to the public on the second weekend in July. Pre-fair crews are responsible for setting up the site's physical infrastructure and preparing the site both for the festival and for the increase in people on the land with the aim of reducing impact and preserving natural flora and fauna. Preservation and restoration efforts are led by the Site and Facilities Manager year round, and are largely carried out by the Residential Caretaker with the help of a special crew known as Site Crew who report directly to the Caretaker and Site and Facilities Manager. <ref name=\"Oregon Country Fair\"/>\n\nAll volunteers agree to the Oregon Country Fair Guidelines and Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct of The Oregon Country Fair is:\n\n{{quote|We are an association of equals. Each and every member of our community is entitled to respectful and equitable treatment by all other participants. We should all act responsibly towards one another wherever we gather.

It is governed by an elected ten-member Board of Directors (with 2 elected alternates). There are seven staff positions within the organization. Staff positions traditionally include a General Manager, an Operations Manager, an Assistant Manager, A Site and Facilities Manager, a Residential Caretaker, a Groundskeeper, and an Administrative Assistant. Currently the fair does not have a General Manager. Until a full-time General Manager is hired by the Board of Directors, the Site and Facilities Manager and Operations Manager share management responsibilities and authority within the organization. \n\n\nAlter-abled access is available at the Oregon Country Fair, including wheelchairs (there is a battery re-charging station for electric wheelchairs), helpers, sign language interpreters, folding chairs, rest areas, maps, and other information. To obtain these services, or more information about them, event participants can go to the following locations on the event site: the ''Alter-Abled Access Advocates(4A)Center'' (located near Admissions as well as at the Bus Stop), ''Community Village'', ''Solutions'', and all ''Information booths''.<ref name=\"oregoncountryfair.org\">http://www.oregoncountryfair.org</ref>\n\nFrom June 1  through August 31 there are no dogs (except service dogs) allowed on the event site.<ref name=\"oregoncountryfair.org\"/>\n\n'''Publications'''\n\nThe Oregon Country Fair publishes a newsletter, the Fair Family News, eleven times a year.  As well as an event paper, the Peach Pit, once a year for the three-day event.<ref name=\"oregoncountryfair.org\"/>\n\n==Volunteer crews==\nThe Oregon Country Fair has a large volunteer network. This volunteer network is the base for all operational needs of the event. While some working volunteers receive food vouchers, which can be used to buy meals from vendors during the event, many volunteers do not. Volunteer crews are separated into \"Pre-fair Crews\" and \"During Fair Crews.\" Pre-fair crews work from the site's opening in early June until the event officially opens to the public on the second weekend in July. Pre-fair crews are responsible for setting up the site's physical infrastructure and preparing the site both for the festival and for the increase in people on the land with the aim of reducing impact and preserving natural flora and fauna. Preservation and restoration efforts are led by the Site and Facilities Manager year round, and are largely carried out by the Residential Caretaker with the help of a special crew known as Site Crew who report directly to the Caretaker and Site and Facilities Manager. <ref name=\"Oregon Country Fair\"/>\n\nAll volunteers agree to the Oregon Country Fair Guidelines and Code of Conduct.

It was founded with the aim of spreading and making more known this new sport ([[Association football|football]]) to the Athenian and Greek public in general. Also, the intention of the founders was to create a team for all of Athens and to be connected with the rest of the European football movement, which was already active.<ref name=\"To 1908\">[http://paoabroad.com/index.php/2014-11-30-15-03-04/kitroef/item/714-to-1908 To 1908... ] | website=Paoabroad.com</ref> The first president elected was Alexandros Kalafatis, brother of Giorgos.

Subsequently, the name of the club changed to Panellinios Podosferikos Omilos (\"Panhellenic Football Club\") and its colours to green and white. By 1914, Campbell had returned to England but the club was already at the top of Greek football with players such as [[Michalis Papazoglou]], Michalis Rokkos and [[Loukas Panourgias]].\n\nIn 1918, the team adopted the [[trifolium]] ([[shamrock]]) as its emblem, as proposed by [[Michalis Papazoglou]].<ref name=\"ethnosport\">{{cite news | title=The Golden Age of PAO | url=http://sports.e-go.gr/article.asp?catid=8332&subid=2&pubid=772208 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421150952/http://sports.e-go.gr/article.asp?catid=8332&subid=2&pubid=772208 | url-status=dead | archive-date=21 April 2008 | work=Ethnosport | language=Greek | publisher=Pegasus Publishing S.A. | author=Kyriazis, Christos | date=4 February 2008 | accessdate=28 March 2008 }}</ref> In 1921 and 1922, the [[Athens-Piraeus Football Clubs Association|Athens-Piraeus FCA]] organized the first two post-[[World War I|WWI]] championships, in both of which PPO was declared champion. By that stage, the club had outgrown both the grounds in Patission Street and Amerikis Square, due mainly to its expansion in other sports, and began to look at vacant land in the area of Perivola on [[Alexandras Avenue]] as its potential new ground.<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> After long discussions with the [[Municipality of Athens]], an agreement was finally reached and in 1922 [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium|''Leoforos'']] (\"Avenue\" in Greek) was granted to the club.<ref name=\"pao vima\"/>\n\nThe move to a permanent home ground also heralded another\u2014final\u2014name change to '''Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos (PAO)''', \"''All-Athenian Athletic Club''\", on 15 March 1924,<ref name=\"pao vima\"/> from now on a [[multi-sport club]].

Messaris, who scored again three goals, became a hero and chant for the fans.\n\n=== Crisis and WWII years ===\nIn 1931, a serious disagreement between leading board member [[Apostolos Nikolaidis (athlete)|Apostolos Nikolaidis]] from one side, and some players (most notably [[Angelos Messaris]]) and club's officials on the other side,<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> regarding the [[professionalization]] in the [[Football in Greece|Greek football]], which lasted two years, damaged the club and led to a counterproductive period. In the meantime, the HFF [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] had commenced in 1932. The last bright moment for the Greens before World War II was winning the Cup for the first time in 1940 against Aris, 3\u20131.\n\nIn 1940, with the break out of the [[Greco-Italian War]], many players of the club joined the [[Hellenic Army]]. [[Mimis Pierrakos]] was killed during the war (later, during the 1950s, his bones were transferred from Albania back to Athens). During the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] from 1941 to 1944, many players of the team became members of [[United Panhellenic Organization of Youth]] (PEAN) resistance organization.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xyzcontagion.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/podosfairo-polemos-katoxi-emfylios |title=Football during the War |website=Xyzcontagion.wordpress.com  |language=Greek }}</ref> while [[Michalis Papazoglou]] had a leading role in the resistance group of [[Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz]].\n\nAfter this long crisis period, Panathinaikos had to wait until 1949 to win again a Greek Championship under the guidance of the Austrian coach [[Johann Strnad]]. That same year, Vangelis Panakis and [[Kostas Linoxilakis]] came to the club and quickly became the side's new star players. Panathinaikos was again champion for the [[1952\u201353 Panhellenic Championship]].\n\nUntil 1959, the team had also won seven of the last eight [[Athens Football Clubs Association|Athens Championships]], the regional championships organised in Greece. In 1959, [[Mimis Domazos]], the emblematic captain of the team, made his first appearance with Panathinaikos and the same year took place the first season under the new system of Alpha Ethniki ([[1959\u201360 Alpha Ethniki]]). Panathinaikos was the champion team.\n\n=== 1960s: The Golden Decade, the Bobek's rejuvenation ===\nDuring the next years, Panathinaikos were again champions in [[1960\u201361 Alpha Ethniki|1961]], [[1961\u201362 Alpha Ethniki|1962]], [[1963\u201364 Alpha Ethniki|1964]], [[1964\u201365 Alpha Ethniki|1965]], [[1968\u201369 Alpha Ethniki|1969]] and [[1969\u201370 Alpha Ethniki|1970]]. Moreover, the team won two more Greek Cups, in [[1966\u201367 Greek Cup|1967]] and [[1968\u201369 Greek Cup|1969]]. Also, during these years, a long process of rejuvenation took place in the club. Notable players retired, such as Panakis, Linoxilakis, [[Takis Loukanidis]] and [[Andreas Papaemmanouil]], and the team had to count on young players like Domazos, [[Antonis Antoniadis]], [[Anthimos Kapsis]], [[Kostas Eleftherakis]] and [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]].\n\n[[Stjepan Bobek]] was the main contributor to this process. In 1963, he became the club's head coach, changing the playing style of the team to a 4\u20133\u20133 and created a new team based on young players (the \"Bobek's rejuvenation\"). Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the Championship of 1964 without a loss, making them one of the two teams that has won the Greek Championship (with its modern system) undefeated.<ref name=\"paohistory2\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229045544/http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archivedate=29 December 2015\n |title=History\n |website=Pao.gr\n |accessdate=23 June 2011\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref> Notable players of the team included Panakis, Domazos, [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]], [[Totis Filakouris]], [[Frangiskos Sourpis]] and [[Aristidis Kamaras]].\n\nWith the establishment of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military regime]], the president of the club, [[Loukas Panourgias]], was forced out of the presidency.

The stadium is located on [[Alexandras Avenue]] and is most commonly referred to as ''Leoforos'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for \"Avenue\"). It is considered one of the most historic stadiums in Greece, as it was used by the [[Greece national football team|Greek national team]] as home ground for many years (most recently for the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] qualifying matches) and even by Panathinaikos' biggest rivals, [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], on various occasions.\n\nPanathinaikos left ''Leoforos'' in 1984 to play in the newly-built [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]]. In 2000, then-club president Angelos Filippidis announced a return to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, following a \u20ac7 million renovation. Capacity was reduced from 25,000 to 16,620, new dressing rooms were built and modular stand roofing was added in compliance with [[UEFA]] requirements, but in 2004, stricter standards were announced and the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium would need further expansion were it to remain suitable for UEFA-sanctioned matches. This was precluded by local zoning regulations and the team had to return to the Olympic Stadium once more until a new stadium, the proposed [[Votanikos Arena]], was built. The ''Leoforos'' ground was due for demolition.\n\nOn 27 January 2007, the board of Panathinaikos decided to reuse the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium for the team's 2007\u201308 domestic league and UEFA Cup home games. Additionally, the club officials decided to install new lawn, new seats and upgrade the press conference room and the restrooms.\n\nAs of October 2013, and due to the club's and the country's financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium have been put on hold. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again.\n\nThe current president of the club, [[Giannis Alafouzos]], declared his intention for another renovation of the stadium and the capacity increase, while the [[Panathinaikos Movement]] made its propositions for a total reconstruction.\n\nIn 2019 the owner of Panathinaikos basketball team presented a funding plan for the construction of  the new football and basketball stadiums of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]] \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

That same year, the [[Panathinaikos F.C. Academy|Academy]] of the club was reorganized, becoming one of the best in the country and feeding the first team with notable players, such as [[Giorgos Karagounis]], [[Angelos Basinas]], [[Sotirios Kyrgiakos]] and [[Sotiris Ninis]] among others, key members of the Greek national team. In 2013, was decided the move of the club from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the team. Located in the area of [[Koropi]], [[Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center]] became a new training ground and Academy base of Panathinaikos.\n\n==Financial information==\nUntil 1979, football in Greece was still in amateur level. The team, such as the other departments of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]], depended on the financial support of the club's members, while the president (responsible for all athletic departments) was elected by the Board members. In 1979, the Greek football turned professional and the Vardinogiannis family purchased the football department. [[Yiorgos Vardinogiannis|Giorgos Vardinogiannis]] became the new president.<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> Vardinogiannis family were the owners of the club the next decades.\n\nOn 22 April 2008, and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50%\u2014after 30 years of full ownership\u2014through a \u20ac80 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% (as before) and the new shareholders 34%. [[Pavlos Giannakopoulos]], [[Nikos Pateras]], [[Adamantios Polemis]] and [[Andreas Vgenopoulos (businessman)|Andreas Vgenopoulos]] were the main investors, plus other minor shareholders. Nikos Pateras was selected to be the new president.\n\nIn 2011, due to financial problems and management disagreements, the direction decided to reduce the budget and sell many players. In 2012, the owner of [[Skai TV]], [[Giannis Alafouzos]], devised a plan to take Vardinogiannis' shares (54.7%) and make them available to fans around Greece so that everyone could contribute, so that Panathinaikos could overcome the crisis.<ref name=\"alafouzos1\"/> His intention was to create a new, for the Greek athletic standards, [[List of fan-owned sports teams|supporter-owned football club]]. On 2 July 2012, the '''Panathenaic Alliance''' finally opened to the public so that everyone could be a member and contribute a desired amount in return for privileges. A few days later, Giannis Vardinogiannis gave his shares\u201454.7% of Panathinaikos\u2014to the Alliance, while the other shareholders maintained their percentage. The members of the Alliance through elections compose the Board of Directors and elect the club's president. The first president elected was [[Giannis Alafouzos]]. In 2013, was decided the move of the team from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the club. Located in the area of [[Koropi]], [[Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center]] became the new training ground and academy base of Panathinaikos.\n\nFor the [[2014\u201315 Panathinaikos F.C. season|2014\u201315]] season, the membership had risen up to 8,495 members contributing a total of \u20ac2,680,041.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"color:black;\"\n!

Messaris, who scored again three goals, became a hero and chant for the fans.\n\n=== Crisis and WWII years ===\nIn 1931, a serious disagreement between leading board member [[Apostolos Nikolaidis (athlete)|Apostolos Nikolaidis]] from one side, and some players (most notably [[Angelos Messaris]]) and club's officials on the other side,<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> regarding the [[professionalization]] in the [[Football in Greece|Greek football]], which lasted two years, damaged the club and led to a counterproductive period. In the meantime, the HFF [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] had commenced in 1932. The last bright moment for the Greens before World War II was winning the Cup for the first time in 1940 against Aris, 3\u20131.\n\nIn 1940, with the break out of the [[Greco-Italian War]], many players of the club joined the [[Hellenic Army]]. [[Mimis Pierrakos]] was killed during the war (later, during the 1950s, his bones were transferred from Albania back to Athens). During the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] from 1941 to 1944, many players of the team became members of [[United Panhellenic Organization of Youth]] (PEAN) resistance organization.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xyzcontagion.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/podosfairo-polemos-katoxi-emfylios |title=Football during the War |website=Xyzcontagion.wordpress.com  |language=Greek }}</ref> while [[Michalis Papazoglou]] had a leading role in the resistance group of [[Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz]].\n\nAfter this long crisis period, Panathinaikos had to wait until 1949 to win again a Greek Championship under the guidance of the Austrian coach [[Johann Strnad]]. That same year, Vangelis Panakis and [[Kostas Linoxilakis]] came to the club and quickly became the side's new star players. Panathinaikos was again champion for the [[1952\u201353 Panhellenic Championship]].\n\nUntil 1959, the team had also won seven of the last eight [[Athens Football Clubs Association|Athens Championships]], the regional championships organised in Greece. In 1959, [[Mimis Domazos]], the emblematic captain of the team, made his first appearance with Panathinaikos and the same year took place the first season under the new system of Alpha Ethniki ([[1959\u201360 Alpha Ethniki]]). Panathinaikos was the champion team.\n\n=== 1960s: The Golden Decade, the Bobek's rejuvenation ===\nDuring the next years, Panathinaikos were again champions in [[1960\u201361 Alpha Ethniki|1961]], [[1961\u201362 Alpha Ethniki|1962]], [[1963\u201364 Alpha Ethniki|1964]], [[1964\u201365 Alpha Ethniki|1965]], [[1968\u201369 Alpha Ethniki|1969]] and [[1969\u201370 Alpha Ethniki|1970]]. Moreover, the team won two more Greek Cups, in [[1966\u201367 Greek Cup|1967]] and [[1968\u201369 Greek Cup|1969]]. Also, during these years, a long process of rejuvenation took place in the club. Notable players retired, such as Panakis, Linoxilakis, [[Takis Loukanidis]] and [[Andreas Papaemmanouil]], and the team had to count on young players like Domazos, [[Antonis Antoniadis]], [[Anthimos Kapsis]], [[Kostas Eleftherakis]] and [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]].\n\n[[Stjepan Bobek]] was the main contributor to this process. In 1963, he became the club's head coach, changing the playing style of the team to a 4\u20133\u20133 and created a new team based on young players (the \"Bobek's rejuvenation\"). Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the Championship of 1964 without a loss, making them one of the two teams that has won the Greek Championship (with its modern system) undefeated.<ref name=\"paohistory2\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229045544/http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archivedate=29 December 2015\n |title=History\n |website=Pao.gr\n |accessdate=23 June 2011\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref> Notable players of the team included Panakis, Domazos, [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]], [[Totis Filakouris]], [[Frangiskos Sourpis]] and [[Aristidis Kamaras]].\n\nWith the establishment of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military regime]], the president of the club, [[Loukas Panourgias]], was forced out of the presidency.

The stadium is located on [[Alexandras Avenue]] and is most commonly referred to as ''Leoforos'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for \"Avenue\"). It is considered one of the most historic stadiums in Greece, as it was used by the [[Greece national football team|Greek national team]] as home ground for many years (most recently for the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] qualifying matches) and even by Panathinaikos' biggest rivals, [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], on various occasions.\n\nPanathinaikos left ''Leoforos'' in 1984 to play in the newly-built [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]]. In 2000, then-club president Angelos Filippidis announced a return to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, following a \u20ac7 million renovation. Capacity was reduced from 25,000 to 16,620, new dressing rooms were built and modular stand roofing was added in compliance with [[UEFA]] requirements, but in 2004, stricter standards were announced and the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium would need further expansion were it to remain suitable for UEFA-sanctioned matches. This was precluded by local zoning regulations and the team had to return to the Olympic Stadium once more until a new stadium, the proposed [[Votanikos Arena]], was built. The ''Leoforos'' ground was due for demolition.\n\nOn 27 January 2007, the board of Panathinaikos decided to reuse the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium for the team's 2007\u201308 domestic league and UEFA Cup home games. Additionally, the club officials decided to install new lawn, new seats and upgrade the press conference room and the restrooms.\n\nAs of October 2013, and due to the club's and the country's financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium have been put on hold. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again.\n\nThe current president of the club, [[Giannis Alafouzos]], declared his intention for another renovation of the stadium and the capacity increase, while the [[Panathinaikos Movement]] made its propositions for a total reconstruction.\n\nIn 2019 the owner of Panathinaikos basketball team presented a funding plan for the construction of  the new football and basketball stadiums of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]] \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

In 2013, was decided the move of the club from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the team. Located in the area of [[Koropi]], [[Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center]] became a new training ground and Academy base of Panathinaikos.\n\n==Financial information==\nUntil 1979, football in Greece was still in amateur level. The team, such as the other departments of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]], depended on the financial support of the club's members, while the president (responsible for all athletic departments) was elected by the Board members. In 1979, the Greek football turned professional and the Vardinogiannis family purchased the football department. [[Yiorgos Vardinogiannis|Giorgos Vardinogiannis]] became the new president.<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> Vardinogiannis family were the owners of the club the next decades.\n\nOn 22 April 2008, and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50%\u2014after 30 years of full ownership\u2014through a \u20ac80 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% (as before) and the new shareholders 34%.

Material showing explicit, non-simulated sex that is pornographic in nature is rated '''X18+'''.\n\nPeople under 18 may not buy, rent, exhibit, or view these films. The exhibition or sale of these films to people under the age of 18 years is a criminal offence carrying a maximum fine of $5,500. Films classified as X18+ are forbidden from being sold or rented anywhere in the six [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]]. They are legally available to be sold or hired in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Northern Territory]]. Importing X18+ material from these territories to any of the Australian states is legal, as the [[Constitution of Australia|constitution]] forbids any restrictions on trade between the states and territories.\n\n==France==\nFilms may be shown in theaters in France only after classification by an administrative commission of the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]]. In 1975, the '''X classification''' (officially: \"pornographic or violence-inciting movies\") was created for pornographic movies, or movies with successions of scenes of graphic violence. The commission has some leeway in classification; it may for instance take into account the artistic qualities of a movie not to count it pornographic. Movies with an X rating may only be shown in specific theaters (which hardly exist nowadays in France); they bear special taxes and tax rates, including a 33% tax on revenue.\n\nIn 2000, some conservative associations sued the government for granting the movie ''[[Baise-moi]]'', which contained graphic, realistic scenes of sex and violence, a non-X classification. The [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] ruled that the movie should have been rated X. The decision was highly controversial, and some suggested changing the law under which it was rated 18.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n{{main|History of British film certificates}}\nThe original '''X certificate''', replacing the [[H certificate]], was issued between 1951 and 1982 by the [[British Board of Film Censors]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was introduced as a result of the Wheare Report on film censorship. From 1951 to 1970, it meant \"Extremely graphic, only those aged 16 and over can be admitted,\" and from 1970 to 1982 it was redefined as meaning \"Suitable for those aged 18 and over\". The X certificate was replaced in November 1982 by the [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]]. \n\nSometimes the rating of a film has changed significantly over time. For example, the French film  ''[[Jules and Jim]]'' received an X rating in 1962 that was reduced to a [[Rated PG|PG]] rating in 1991.<ref>[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/search/releases/Jules%2Band%2BJim \"Jules and Jim\"], British Board of Film Classification</ref> In some early cases, films with extreme political content received an X rating. ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' was refused a certificate for \"inflammatory subtitles and [[Bolshevist|Bolshevik]] propaganda\" in 1926, passed X in 1954, and finally rated PG in 1987.<ref>[http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/CaseStudies/Battleship_Potemkin Case Study:Battleship Potemkin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301233439/http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/CaseStudies/Battleship_Potemkin |date=March 1, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==United States==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}\nIn the [[United States]], the '''X rating''' was applied to a film that contained content judged unsuitable for [[children]], such as extreme violence, strongly implied sex, and graphic language. When the [[Motion Picxxxxx \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film rating system]] began in America on November 1, 1968, the X rating was given to a film by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] if submitted to it, or due to its non-trademarked status, it could be self-applied to a film by a distributor that knew beforehand that its film contained content unsuitable for minors. From the [[New Hollywood|late 1960s]] to about the [[1980s in film|mid-1980s]], many mainstream films were released with an X rating, such as ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', ''[[Medium Cool]]'', ''[[The Girl on a Motorcycle]]'', ''[[Last Summer]]'', ''[[Last of the Mobile Hot Shots]]'', ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'', ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'', ''[[Flesh Gordon]]'', ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1976 film)|Alice in Wonderland: An X-Rated Musical Comedy]]'', ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' and ''[[The Evil Dead (1981 film)|The Evil Dead]]''. (Films that achieved critical and commercial success were later re-rated R after minor cuts, including ''Midnight Cowboy'' and ''A Clockwork Orange.'') The threat of an X rating also encouraged filmmakers to [[Re-edited film|re-edit]] their films to achieve an R rating; one notable example of this was the 1987 action film ''[[RoboCop]]'', which had to be edited eleven times before it could attain an R rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzBkjTxD1a0 |title=Backstory RoboCop AMC |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718170224/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzBkjTxD1a0 |archivedate=July 18, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBecause the X rating was not trademarked, anybody could apply it to their films, including pornographers, as many began to do in the 1970s. As [[pornography]] began to become chic and more legally and commercially tolerated, pornographers placed an X rating on their films to emphasize the adult content. Some even started using multiple X's (i.e. XX, XXX, etc.) to give the impression that their film contained more graphic sexual content than the simple X rating. In some cases, the X ratings were applied by reviewers or film scholars, e.g. [[William Rotsler]], who wrote \"The XXX-rating means [[Hardcore pornography|hard-core]], the XX-rating is for [[Softcore pornography|simulation]], and an X-rating is for comparatively cool films.\"<ref>Rotslter, William. ''Contemporary Erotic Cinema''. New York: [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]/[[Ballantine Books]], 1973. page 251.</ref> Nothing beyond the simple X rating has ever been officially recognized by the MPAA. Because of the heavy use of the X rating by pornographers, it became associated largely with pornographic films, so that non-pornographic films given an X rating would have fewer theaters willing to book them and fewer venues for advertising. Many newspapers refused to advertise X-rated films. This led to a number of films being released unrated sometimes with a warning that the film contained content for adults only. In response, the MPAA eventually agreed in 1990 to a new [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#X replaced by NC-17|NC-17]] rating that would be trademarked, and could only be applied by the MPAA itself. By [[trademark]]ing the rating, the MPAA committed to defending an NC-17 film charged with violating obscenity laws.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Censorship]]\n* [[List of NC-17 rated films]]\n* [[Motion Picture Production Code]]\n* [[Profanity|Strong language]]\n* [[Television content rating system]]\n* [[.xxx]], top-level Internet domain\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/591679/index.html ''Screen Online'' article about the X certificate]\n* [http://www.refused-classification.com/ Refused Classification] Website covering in varying detail many films that have run foul of the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification, with separate sections for hardcore films and video games\n* [http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-adelphia2feb02,0,7840216.story?coll=la-home-headlines Explanation of X-ratings in the US]\n* [http://www.comstockfilms.com/blog/tony/2007/08/07/how-x-rated-came-to-mean-porn-and-the-death-of-movies-for-grown-ups/ How \u201cX-rated\u201d Came to Mean \u201cPorn\u201d and the Death of Movies for Grown-ups A brief history of the social and legal forces that drove adult themes out of the legitimate cinema, by film director Tony Comstock]\n* [http://www.news.com.au/technology/gaming/ban-lifted-it-only-took-10-years-but-government-gives-r18-video-games-the-go-ahead/story-e6frfrt9-1226271652456 Australian government says yes to R18+ video games bill]\n{{Pornography}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:X Rating}}\n[[Category:Motion picture rating systems]]\n[[Category:British Board of Film Classification]]\n[[Category:Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Self-censorship]]\n[[Category:Film censorship]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Grade of film rating}}\n{{Redirect|Rated X}}\n\n{{refimprove|date=October 2010}}\n{{Multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | align = right\n | image1 = BBFC_X_1951-1970.png\n | width1 = 55\n | alt1 = BBFC X symbol 1951-1970\n | image2 = BBFC X 1970-1982.png\n | width2 = 75\n | alt2 = BBFC X symbol 1970-1982\n | footer = Two \"X\" symbols used by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (1951\u20131970 and 1970\u20131982, respectively)\n}}\n\nAn '''X rating''' is a rating used to classify movies that are only meant for adults.\n\n==Australia==\nThe [[Australian Classification Board]] (ACB, formerly known as the OFLC), a government institution, issues ratings for all movies and television shows exhibited, televised, sold, or hired in Australia.

Text summarization finds the most informative sentences in a document<ref name=\"Torres2014\">{{cite book|author1=Torres-Moreno, Juan-Manuel|title=Automatic Text Summarization|url=https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Automatic+Text+Summarization-p-9781848216686|date=Octobre 1 2014|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-848-21668-6|pages=320\u2013}}</ref>\n; image summarization finds the most representative images within an image collection {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}; video summarization extracts the most important frames from the video content.<ref name=\"PalPetrosino2012\">{{cite book|author1=Sankar K.

Examples of extracted content include key-phrases that can be used to \"tag\" or index a text document, or key sentences (including headings) that collectively comprise an abstract, and representative images or video segments, as stated above. For text, extraction is analogous to the process of skimming, where the summary (if available), headings and subheadings, figures, the first and last paragraphs of a section, and optionally the first and last sentences in a paragraph are read before one chooses to read the entire document in detail.<ref> Richard Sutz, Peter Weverka. How to skim text. https://www.dummies.com/education/language-arts/speed-reading/how-to-skim-text/ Accessed Dec 2019. </ref>\n\n===Abstraction-based summarization===\n\nThis has been applied mainly for text. Abstractive methods build an internal semantic representation of the original content, and then use this representation to create a summary that is closer to what a human might express. Abstraction may transform the extracted content by [[automated paraphrasing|paraphrasing]] sections of the source document, to condense a text more strongly than extraction. Such transformation, however, is computationally much more challenging than extraction, involving both [[natural language processing]] and often a deep understanding of the domain of the original text in cases where the original document relates to a special field of knowledge.\n\"Paraphrasing\" is even more difficult to apply to image and video, which is why most summarization systems are extractive.\n\n===Aided summarization===\n\nApproaches aimed at higher summarization quality rely on combined software and human effort. In Machine Aided Human Summarization, extractive techniques highlight candidate passages for inclusion (to which the human adds or removes text). In Human Aided Machine Summarization, a human post-processes software output, in the same way that one edits the output of automatic translation by Google Translate.\n\n==Applications and systems for summarization==\n<!--needs to make more clear about how to categorize the type of summaries-->\n\nThere are broadly two types of extractive summarization tasks depending on what the summarization program focuses on. The first is ''generic summarization'', which focuses on obtaining a generic summary or abstract of the collection (whether documents, or sets of images, or videos, news stories etc.). The second is  ''query relevant summarization'', sometimes called ''query-based summarization'', which summarizes objects specific to a query. Summarization systems are able to create both query relevant text summaries and generic machine-generated summaries depending on what the user needs.\n\nAn example of a summarization problem is document summarization, which attempts to automatically produce an abstract from a given document. Sometimes one might be interested in generating a summary from a single source document, while others can use multiple source documents (for example, a [[cluster analysis|cluster]] of articles on the same topic). This problem is called [[multi-document summarization]]. A related application is summarizing news articles. Imagine a system, which automatically pulls together news articles on a given topic (from the web), and concisely represents the latest news as a summary.\n\nImage collection summarization is another application example of automatic summarization. It consists in selecting a representative set of images from a larger set of images.<ref>Jorge E. Camargo and Fabio A. Gonz\u00e1lez. A Multi-class Kernel Alignment Method for Image Collection Summarization. In Proceedings of the 14th Iberoamerican Conference on Pattern Recognition: Progress in Pattern Recognition, Image Analysis, Computer Vision, and Applications (CIARP '09), Eduardo Bayro-Corrochano and Jan-Olof Eklundh (Eds.). Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, 545-552.  {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-642-10268-4_64}}</ref> A summary in this context is useful to show the most representative images of results in an [[image collection exploration]] system. Video summarization is a related domain, where the system automatically creates a trailer of a long video. This also has applications in consumer or personal videos, where one might want to skip the boring or repetitive actions. Similarly, in surveillance videos, one would want to extract important and suspicious activity, while ignoring all the boring and redundant frames captured.\n\nAt a very high level, summarization algorithms try to find subsets of objects (like set of sentences, or a set of images), which cover information of the entire set. This is also called the ''core-set''. These algorithms model notions like diversity, coverage, information and representativeness of the summary. Query based summarization techniques, additionally model for relevance of the summary with the query. Some techniques and algorithms which naturally model summarization problems are TextRank and PageRank, [[Submodular set function]], [[Determinantal point process]], maximal marginal relevance (MMR) etc.\n\n===Keyphrase extraction===\nThe task is the following. You are given a piece of text, such as a journal article, and you must produce a list of keywords or key[phrase]s that capture the primary topics discussed in the text.<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-66939-7_19|chapter = SemCluster: Unsupervised Automatic Keyphrase Extraction Using Affinity Propagation|title = Advances in Computational Intelligence Systems|volume = 650|pages = 222\u2013235|series = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|year = 2018|last1 = Alrehamy|first1 = Hassan H|last2 = Walker|first2 = Coral|isbn = 978-3-319-66938-0}}</ref> In the case of [[research article]]s, many authors provide manually assigned keywords, but most text lacks pre-existing keyphrases. For example, news articles rarely have keyphrases attached, but it would be useful to be able to automatically do so for a number of applications discussed below.\nConsider the example text from a news article:\n\n:\"The Army Corps of Engineers, rushing to meet President Bush's promise to protect New Orleans by the start of the 2006 hurricane season, installed defective flood-control pumps last year despite warnings from its own expert that the equipment would fail during a storm, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press\".\n\nA keyphrase extractor might select \"Army Corps of Engineers\", \"President Bush\", \"New Orleans\", and \"defective flood-control pumps\" as keyphrases. These are pulled directly from the text. In contrast, an abstractive keyphrase system would somehow internalize the content and generate keyphrases that do not appear in the text, but more closely resemble what a human might produce, such as \"political negligence\" or \"inadequate protection from floods\". Abstraction requires a deep [[natural language understanding|understanding of the text]], which makes it difficult for a computer system.\nKeyphrases have many applications. They can enable document browsing by providing a short summary, improve [[information retrieval]] (if documents have keyphrases assigned, a user could search by keyphrase to produce more reliable hits than a [[full-text search]]), and be employed in generating index entries for a large text corpus.\n\nDepending on the different literature and the definition of key terms, words or phrases, [[keyword extraction]] is a highly related theme.\n\n====Supervised learning approaches====\nBeginning with the work of Turney,<ref>{{Cite journal |arxiv = cs/0212020|last1 = Turney|first1 = Peter D|title = Learning Algorithms for Keyphrase Extraction|journal = Information Retrieval, )|volume = 2|issue = 4|pages = 303\u2013336|year = 2002|doi = 10.1023/A:1009976227802}}</ref> many researchers have approached keyphrase extraction as a [[supervised machine learning]] problem.\nGiven a document, we construct an example for each [[unigram]], [[bigram]], and trigram found in the text (though other text units are also possible, as discussed below). We then compute various features describing each example (e.g., does the phrase begin with an upper-case letter?). We assume there are known keyphrases available for a set of training documents. Using the known keyphrases, we can assign positive or negative labels to the examples. Then we learn a classifier that can discriminate between positive and negative examples as a function of the features. Some classifiers make a [[binary classification]] for a test example, while others assign a probability of being a keyphrase. For instance, in the above text, we might learn a rule that says phrases with initial capital letters are likely to be keyphrases.\nAfter training a learner, we can select keyphrases for test documents in the following manner. We apply the same example-generation strategy to the test documents, then run each example through the learner. We can determine the keyphrases by looking at binary classification decisions or probabilities returned from our learned model. If probabilities are given, a threshold is used to select the keyphrases.\nKeyphrase extractors are generally evaluated using precision and recall. Precision measures how\nmany of the proposed keyphrases are actually correct. Recall measures how many of the true\nkeyphrases your system proposed. The two measures can be combined in an F-score, which is the\nharmonic mean of the two (''F''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''PR''/(''P''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''R'') ). Matches between the proposed keyphrases and the known keyphrases can be checked after stemming or applying some other text normalization.\n\nDesigning a supervised keyphrase extraction system involves deciding on several choices (some of these apply to unsupervised, too). The first choice is exactly how to generate examples. Turney and others have used all possible unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams without intervening punctuation and after removing stopwords. Hulth showed that you can get some improvement by selecting examples to be sequences of tokens that match certain patterns of part-of-speech tags. Ideally, the mechanism for generating examples produces all the known labeled keyphrases as candidates, though this is often not the case. For example, if we use only unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, then we will never be able to extract a known keyphrase containing four words. Thus, recall may suffer. However, generating too many examples can also lead to low precision.\n\nWe also need to create features that describe the examples and are informative enough to allow a learning algorithm to discriminate keyphrases from non- keyphrases. Typically features involve various term frequencies (how many times a phrase appears in the current text or in a larger corpus), the length of the example, relative position of the first occurrence, various boolean syntactic features (e.g., contains all caps), etc. The Turney paper used about 12 such features. Hulth uses a reduced set of features, which were found most successful in the KEA (Keyphrase Extraction Algorithm) work derived from Turney\u2019s seminal paper.\n\nIn the end, the system will need to return a list of keyphrases for a test document, so we need to have a way to limit the number. Ensemble methods (i.e., using votes from several classifiers) have been used to produce numeric scores that can be thresholded to provide a user-provided number of keyphrases. This is the technique used by Turney with C4.5 decision trees. Hulth used a single binary classifier so the learning algorithm implicitly determines the appropriate number.\n\nOnce examples and features are created, we need a way to learn to predict keyphrases. Virtually any supervised learning algorithm could be used, such as decision trees, [[Naive Bayes]], and rule induction. In the case of Turney's GenEx algorithm, a [[genetic algorithm]] is used to learn parameters for a domain-specific keyphrase extraction algorithm. The extractor follows a series of heuristics to identify keyphrases. The genetic algorithm optimizes parameters for these heuristics with respect to performance on training documents with known key phrases.\n\n====Unsupervised approach: TextRank====\nAnother keyphrase extraction algorithm is TextRank. While supervised methods have some nice properties, like being able to produce interpretable rules for what features characterize a keyphrase, they also require a large amount of [[training set|training data]]. Many documents with known keyphrases are needed. Furthermore, training on a specific domain tends to customize the extraction process to that domain, so the resulting classifier is not necessarily portable, as some of Turney's results demonstrate.\nUnsupervised keyphrase extraction removes the need for training data. It approaches the problem from a different angle. Instead of trying to learn explicit features that characterize keyphrases, the TextRank algorithm<ref>Rada Mihalcea and Paul Tarau, 2004: ''TextRank: Bringing Order into Texts'', Department of Computer Science University of North Texas {{cite web|url=http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/acl2004/emnlp/pdf/Mihalcea.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617170501/http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/acl2004/emnlp/pdf/Mihalcea.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-17 }}</ref> exploits the structure of the text itself to determine keyphrases that appear \"central\" to the text in the same way that [[PageRank]] selects important Web pages. Recall this is based on the notion of \"prestige\" or \"recommendation\" from [[social network]]s. In this way, TextRank does not rely on any previous training data at all, but rather can be run on any arbitrary piece of text, and it can produce output simply based on the text's intrinsic properties. Thus the algorithm is easily portable to new domains and languages.\n\nTextRank is a general purpose [[Graph (abstract data type)|graph]]-based ranking algorithm for [[natural language processing|NLP]]. Essentially, it runs PageRank on a graph specially designed for a particular NLP task. For keyphrase extraction, it builds a graph using some set of text units as vertices. Edges are based on some measure of semantic or [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] [[semantic similarity|similarity]] between the text unit vertices. Unlike PageRank, the edges are typically undirected and can be weighted to reflect a degree of similarity. Once the graph is constructed, it is used to form a stochastic matrix, combined with a damping factor (as in the \"random surfer model\"), and the ranking over vertices is obtained by finding the eigenvector corresponding to [[eigenvalue]] 1 (i.e., the [[stationary distribution]] of the [[random walk]] on the graph).\n\nThe vertices should correspond to what we want to rank. Potentially, we could do something similar to the supervised methods and create a vertex for each unigram, bigram, trigram, etc. However, to keep the graph small, the authors decide to rank individual unigrams in a first step, and then include a second step that merges highly ranked adjacent unigrams to form multi-word phrases. This has a nice side effect of allowing us to produce keyphrases of arbitrary length. For example, if we rank unigrams and find that \"advanced\", \"natural\", \"language\", and \"processing\" all get high ranks, then we would look at the original text and see that these words appear consecutively and create a final keyphrase using all four together. Note that the unigrams placed in the graph can be filtered by part of speech. The authors found that adjectives and nouns were the best to include. Thus, some linguistic knowledge comes into play in this step.\n\nEdges are created based on word [[co-occurrence]] in this application of TextRank. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the [[unigram]]s appear within a window of size N in the original text. N is typically around 2\u201310. Thus, \"natural\" and \"language\" might be linked in a text about NLP. \"Natural\" and \"processing\" would also be linked because they would both appear in the same string of N words. These edges build on the notion of \"text [[Cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]]\" and the idea that words that appear near each other are likely related in a meaningful way and \"recommend\" each other to the reader.\n\nSince this method simply ranks the individual vertices, we need a way to threshold or produce a limited number of keyphrases. The technique chosen is to set a count T to be a user-specified fraction of the total number of vertices in the graph. Then the top T vertices/unigrams are selected based on their stationary probabilities. A post- processing step is then applied to merge adjacent instances of these T unigrams. As a result, potentially more or less than T final keyphrases will be produced, but the number should be roughly proportional to the length of the original text.\n\nIt is not initially clear why applying PageRank to a co-occurrence graph would produce useful keyphrases. One way to think about it is the following. A word that appears multiple times throughout a text may have many different co-occurring neighbors. For example, in a text about machine learning, the unigram \"learning\" might co-occur with \"machine\", \"supervised\", \"un-supervised\", and \"semi-supervised\" in four different sentences. Thus, the \"learning\" vertex would be a central \"hub\" that connects to these other modifying words. Running PageRank/TextRank on the graph is likely to rank \"learning\" highly. Similarly, if the text contains the phrase \"supervised classification\", then there would be an edge between \"supervised\" and \"classification\". If \"classification\" appears several other places and thus has many neighbors, its importance would contribute to the importance of \"supervised\". If it ends up with a high rank, it will be selected as one of the top T unigrams, along with \"learning\" and probably \"classification\". In the final post-processing step, we would then end up with keyphrases \"supervised learning\" and \"supervised classification\".\n\nIn short, the co-occurrence graph will contain densely connected regions for terms that appear often and in different contexts. A random walk on this graph will have a stationary distribution that assigns large probabilities to the terms in the centers of the clusters. This is similar to densely connected Web pages getting ranked highly by PageRank. This approach has also been used in document summarization, considered below.\n\n===Document summarization===\nLike keyphrase extraction, document summarization aims to identify the essence of a text. The only real difference is that now we are dealing with larger text units\u2014whole sentences instead of words and phrases.\n\nBefore getting into the details of some summarization methods, we will mention how summarization systems are typically evaluated. The most common way is using the so-called [[ROUGE (metric)|ROUGE]] (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measure. This is a recall-based measure that determines how well a system-generated summary covers the content present in one or more human-generated model summaries known as references. It is recall-based to encourage systems to include all the important topics in the text. Recall can be computed with respect to unigram, bigram, trigram, or 4-gram matching. For example, ROUGE-1 is computed as division of count of unigrams in reference that appear in system and count of unigrams in reference summary.\n\nIf there are multiple references, the ROUGE-1 scores are averaged. Because ROUGE is based only on content overlap, it can determine if the same general concepts are discussed between an automatic summary and a reference summary, but it cannot determine if the result is coherent or the sentences flow together in a sensible manner. High-order n-gram ROUGE measures try to judge fluency to some degree.\nNote that ROUGE is similar to the BLEU measure for machine translation, but BLEU is precision- based, because translation systems favor accuracy.\n\nA promising line in document summarization is adaptive document/text summarization.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.3103/S0005105510030027|title = Automatic genre recognition and adaptive text summarization| journal=Automatic Documentation and Mathematical Linguistics| volume=44| issue=3| pages=111\u2013120|year = 2010|last1 = Yatsko|first1 = V. A.| last2=Starikov| first2=M. S.| last3=Butakov| first3=A. V.}}</ref> The idea of adaptive summarization involves preliminary recognition of document/text genre and subsequent application of summarization algorithms optimized for this genre. First summarizes that perform adaptive summarization have been created.<ref>[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/universal-summarizer-unis.html UNIS (Universal Summarizer)]</ref>\n\n====Supervised learning approaches====\nSupervised text summarization is very much like supervised keyphrase extraction. Basically, if you have a collection of documents and human-generated summaries for them, you can learn features of sentences that make them good candidates for inclusion in the summary. Features might include the position in the document (i.e., the first few sentences are probably important), the number of words in the sentence, etc. The main difficulty in supervised extractive summarization is that the known summaries must be manually created by extracting sentences so the sentences in an original training document can be labeled as \"in summary\" or \"not in summary\". This is not typically how people create summaries, so simply using journal abstracts or existing summaries is usually not sufficient. The sentences in these summaries do not necessarily match up with sentences in the original text, so it would be difficult to assign labels to examples for training. Note, however, that these natural summaries can still be used for evaluation purposes, since ROUGE-1 only cares about unigrams.\n\n====Maximum entropy-based summarization====\nDuring the DUC 2001 and 2002 evaluation workshops, [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] developed a sentence extraction system for multi-document summarization in the news domain. The system was based on a hybrid system using a [[naive Bayes]] classifier and statistical language models for modeling salience. Although the system exhibited good results, the researchers wanted to explore the effectiveness of a [[maximum entropy classifier|maximum entropy]] (ME) classifier for the meeting summarization task, as ME is known to be robust against feature dependencies. Maximum entropy has also been applied successfully for summarization in the broadcast news domain.\n\n====TextRank and LexRank====\nThe unsupervised approach to summarization is also quite similar in spirit to unsupervised keyphrase extraction and gets around the issue of costly training data. Some unsupervised summarization approaches are based on finding a \"[[centroid]]\" sentence, which is the mean word vector of all the sentences in the document. Then the sentences can be ranked with regard to their similarity to this centroid sentence.\n\nA more principled way to estimate sentence importance is using random walks and eigenvector centrality. LexRank<ref>G\u00fcne\u015f Erkan and Dragomir R. Radev: ''LexRank: Graph-based Lexical Centrality as Salience in Text Summarization [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume22/erkan04a-html/erkan04a.html]''</ref> is an algorithm essentially identical to TextRank, and both use this approach for document summarization. The two methods were developed by different groups at the same time, and LexRank simply focused on summarization, but could just as easily be used for keyphrase extraction or any other NLP ranking task.\n\nIn both LexRank and TextRank, a graph is constructed by creating a vertex for each sentence in the document.\n\nThe edges between sentences are based on some form of semantic similarity or content overlap. While LexRank uses [[cosine similarity]] of [[TF-IDF]] vectors, TextRank uses a very similar measure based on the number of words two sentences have in common ([[Quantile normalization|normalized]] by the sentences' lengths). The LexRank paper explored using unweighted edges after applying a threshold to the cosine values, but also experimented with using edges with weights equal to the similarity score. TextRank uses continuous [[similarity score]]s as weights.\n\nIn both algorithms, the sentences are ranked by applying PageRank to the resulting graph. A summary is formed by combining the top ranking sentences, using a threshold or length cutoff to limit the size of the summary.\n\nIt is worth noting that TextRank was applied to summarization exactly as described here, while LexRank was used as part of a larger summarization system ([[MEAD]]) that combines the LexRank score (stationary probability) with other features like sentence position and length using a [[linear combination]] with either user-specified or automatically tuned weights. In this case, some training documents might be needed, though the TextRank results show the additional features are not absolutely necessary.\n\nAnother important distinction is that TextRank was used for single document summarization, while LexRank has been applied to multi-document summarization. The task remains the same in both cases\u2014only the number of sentences to choose from has grown. However, when summarizing multiple documents, there is a greater risk of selecting duplicate or highly redundant sentences to place in the same summary. Imagine you have a cluster of news articles on a particular event, and you want to produce one summary. Each article is likely to have many similar sentences, and you would only want to include distinct ideas in the summary. To address this issue, LexRank applies a heuristic post-processing step that builds up a summary by adding sentences in rank order, but discards any sentences that are too similar to ones already placed in the summary. The method used is called Cross-Sentence Information Subsumption (CSIS).\n\nThese methods work based on the idea that sentences \"recommend\" other similar sentences to the reader. Thus, if one sentence is very similar to many others, it will likely be a sentence of great importance. The importance of this sentence also stems from the importance of the sentences \"recommending\" it. Thus, to get ranked highly and placed in a summary, a sentence must be similar to many sentences that are in turn also similar to many other sentences. This makes intuitive sense and allows the algorithms to be applied to any arbitrary new text. The methods are domain-independent and easily portable. One could imagine the features indicating important sentences in the news domain might vary considerably from the biomedical domain. However, the unsupervised \"recommendation\"-based approach applies to any domain.\n\n====Multi-document summarization====\n{{Main|Multi-document summarization}}\n'''Multi-document summarization''' is an automatic procedure aimed at extraction of information from multiple texts written about the same topic. Resulting summary report allows individual users, such as professional information consumers, to quickly familiarize themselves with information contained in a large cluster of documents. In such a way, multi-document summarization systems are complementing the [[news aggregators]] performing the next step down the road of coping with [[information overload]]. Multi-document summarization may also be done in response to a question.<ref>\"[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis]\", International Journal of Intelligent Information Database Systems, 5(2), 119-142, 2011.</ref>\n\nMulti-document summarization creates information reports that are both concise and comprehensive. With different opinions being put together and outlined, every topic is described from multiple perspectives within a single document. While the goal of a brief summary is to simplify information search and cut the time by pointing to the most relevant source documents, comprehensive multi-document summary should itself contain the required information, hence limiting the need for accessing original files to cases when refinement is required.\nAutomatic summaries present information extracted from multiple sources algorithmically, without any editorial touch or subjective human intervention, thus making it completely unbiased. {{dubious|date=June 2018}}\n\n=====Incorporating diversity=====\nMulti-document extractive summarization faces a problem of potential redundancy. Ideally, we would like to extract sentences that are both \"central\" (i.e., contain the main ideas) and \"diverse\" (i.e., they differ from one another). LexRank deals with diversity as a heuristic final stage using CSIS, and other systems have used similar methods, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR),<ref>Carbonell, Jaime, and Jade Goldstein. \"[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/.cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/jgc/publication/MMR_DiversityBased_Reranking_SIGIR_1998.pdf The use of MMR, diversity-based reranking for reordering documents and producing summaries].\" Proceedings of the 21st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval. ACM, 1998.</ref> in trying to eliminate redundancy in information retrieval results. There is a general purpose graph-based ranking algorithm like Page/Lex/TextRank that handles both \"centrality\" and \"diversity\" in a unified mathematical framework based on [[absorbing Markov chain]] random walks. (An absorbing random walk is like a standard random walk, except some states are now absorbing states that act as \"black holes\" that cause the walk to end abruptly at that state.) The algorithm is called GRASSHOPPER.<ref>Zhu, Xiaojin, et al. \"[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N07-1013 Improving Diversity in Ranking using Absorbing Random Walks].\" HLT-NAACL. 2007.</ref> In addition to explicitly promoting diversity during the ranking process, GRASSHOPPER incorporates a prior ranking (based on sentence position in the case of summarization).\n\nThe state of the art results for multi-document summarization, however, are obtained using mixtures of submodular functions. These methods have achieved the state of the art results for Document Summarization Corpora, DUC 04 - 07.<ref>Hui Lin, Jeff Bilmes. \"[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.4871 Learning mixtures of submodular shells with application to document summarization]</ref> Similar results were also achieved with the use of determinantal point processes (which are a special case of submodular functions) for DUC-04.<ref>Alex Kulesza and Ben Taskar, [http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/DownloadSummary/MAL-044 Determinantal point processes for machine learning]. Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning, December 2012.</ref>\n\nA new method for multi-lingual multi-document summarization that avoids redundancy works by simplifying and generating ideograms that represent the meaning of each sentence in each document and then evaluates similarity \"qualitatively\" by comparing the shape and position of said ideograms has recently been developed. This tool does not use word frequency, does not need training or preprocessing of any kind and works by generating ideograms that represent the meaning of each sentence and then summarizes using two user-supplied parameters: equivalence (when are two sentences to be considered equivalent) and relevance (how long is the desired summary).\n\n===Submodular functions as generic tools for summarization===\nThe idea of a [[submodular set function]] has recently emerged as a powerful modeling tool for various summarization problems. Submodular functions naturally model notions of ''coverage'', ''information'', ''representation'' and ''diversity''. Moreover, several important [[combinatorial optimization]] problems occur as special instances of submodular optimization. For example, the [[set cover problem]] is a special case of submodular optimization, since the set cover function is submodular. The set cover function attempts to find a subset of objects which ''cover'' a given set of concepts. For example, in document summarization, one would like the summary to cover all important and relevant concepts in the document. This is an instance of set cover. Similarly, the [[facility location problem]] is a special case of submodular functions. The Facility Location function also naturally models coverage and diversity. Another example of a submodular optimization problem is using a [[determinantal point process]] to model diversity. Similarly, the Maximum-Marginal-Relevance procedure can also be seen as an instance of submodular optimization. All these important models encouraging coverage, diversity and information are all submodular. Moreover, submodular functions can be efficiently combined together, and the resulting function is still submodular. Hence, one could combine one submodular function which models diversity, another one which models coverage and use human supervision to learn a right model of a submodular function for the problem.\n\nWhile submodular functions are fitting problems for summarization, they also admit very efficient algorithms for optimization. For example, a simple [[greedy algorithm]] admits a constant factor guarantee.<ref>Nemhauser, George L., Laurence A. Wolsey, and Marshall L. Fisher. \"An analysis of approximations for maximizing submodular set functions\u2014I.\" Mathematical Programming 14.1 (1978): 265-294.</ref> Moreover, the greedy algorithm is extremely simple to implement and can scale to large datasets, which is very important for summarization problems.\n\nSubmodular functions have achieved state-of-the-art for almost all summarization problems. For example, work by Lin and Bilmes, 2012<ref>Hui Lin, Jeff Bilmes. \"[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.4871 Learning mixtures of submodular shells with application to document summarization]\", UAI, 2012</ref> shows that submodular functions achieve the best results to date on DUC-04, DUC-05, DUC-06 and DUC-07 systems for document summarization. Similarly, work by Lin and Bilmes, 2011,<ref>Hui Lin, Jeff Bilmes. \"[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1052 A Class of Submodular Functions for Document Summarization]\", The 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (ACL-HLT), 2011</ref> shows that many existing systems for automatic summarization are instances of submodular functions. This was a breakthrough result establishing submodular functions as the right models for summarization problems.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nSubmodular Functions have also been used for other summarization tasks. Tschiatschek et al., 2014 show<ref>Sebastian Tschiatschek, Rishabh Iyer, Hoachen Wei and Jeff Bilmes, [http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5415-learning-mixtures-of-submodular-functions-for-image-collection-summarization.pdf Learning Mixtures of Submodular Functions for Image Collection Summarization], In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, December - 2014.</ref> that mixtures of submodular functions achieve state-of-the-art results for image collection summarization.

Currently, it is not clear what the relation of evaluation is to any of the above topics. The following questions need to be answered: First, in the context of automatic summarization, what is evaluation?  Second, what is the significance of evaluation?  That is, what is evaluation used for?\n-->\nThe most common way to evaluate the informativeness of automatic summaries is to compare them with human-made model summaries.\n\nEvaluation techniques fall into intrinsic and extrinsic,<ref>[http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/workshop/OnlineProceedings2/sum-mani.pdf Mani, I.

A.| last2=Vishnyakov| first2=T. N.}}</ref>\n\n=== Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation ===\nAn intrinsic evaluation tests the summarization system in and of itself while an extrinsic evaluation tests the summarization based on how it affects the completion of some other task. Intrinsic evaluations have\nassessed mainly the coherence and informativeness of summaries. Extrinsic evaluations, on the other hand, have tested the impact of summarization on tasks like relevance assessment, reading comprehension, etc.\n\n=== Inter-textual and intra-textual ===\nIntra-textual methods assess the output of a specific summarization system, and the inter-textual ones focus on contrastive analysis of outputs of several summarization systems.\n\nHuman judgement often has wide variance on what is considered a \"good\" summary, which means that making the evaluation process automatic is particularly difficult. Manual evaluation can be used, but this is both time and labor-intensive as it requires humans to read not only the summaries but also the source documents. Other issues are those concerning [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] and coverage.\n\nOne of the metrics used in [[NIST]]'s annual Document Understanding Conferences, in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks, is the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation [https://web.archive.org/web/20060408135021/http://haydn.isi.edu/ROUGE/]). It essentially calculates [[n-gram]] overlaps between automatically generated summaries and previously-written human summaries. A high level of overlap should indicate a high level of shared concepts between the two summaries. Note that overlap metrics like this are unable to provide any feedback on a summary's coherence. [[anaphora (linguistics)|Anaphor resolution]] remains another problem yet to be fully solved. Similarly, for image summarization, Tschiatschek et al., developed a Visual-ROUGE score which judges the performance of algorithms for image summarization.<ref>Sebastian Tschiatschek, Rishabh Iyer, Hoachen Wei and Jeff Bilmes, [http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5415-learning-mixtures-of-submodular-functions-for-image-collection-summarization.pdf Learning Mixtures of Submodular Functions for Image Collection Summarization], In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, December - 2014. (PDF)</ref>\n\n===Domain specific versus domain independent summarization techniques===\nDomain independent summarization techniques generally apply sets of general features which can be used to identify information-rich text segments. Recent research focus has drifted to domain-specific summarization techniques that utilize the available knowledge specific to the domain of text. For example, automatic summarization research on medical text generally attempts to utilize the various sources of codified medical knowledge and ontologies.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Sarker|first1=Abeed|last2=Molla|first2=Diego|last3=Paris|first3=Cecile|title=An Approach for Query-focused Text Summarization for Evidence-based medicine|date=2013|volume=7885|pages=295\u2013304|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38326-7_41|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-642-38325-0}}</ref>\n\n===Evaluating summaries qualitatively===\nThe main drawback of the evaluation systems existing so far is that we need at least one reference summary, and for some methods more than one, to be able to compare automatic summaries with models. This is a hard and expensive task. Much effort has to be done in order to have corpus of texts and their corresponding summaries. Furthermore, for some methods, not only do we need to have human-made summaries available for comparison, but also manual annotation has to be performed in some of them (e.g. SCU in the Pyramid Method). In any case, what the evaluation methods need as an input, is a set of summaries to serve as gold standards and a set of automatic summaries. Moreover, they all perform a quantitative evaluation with regard to different similarity metrics.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sentence extraction]]\n* [[Text mining]]\n* [[Multi-document summarization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book |last=Hercules |first=Dalianis |year=2003 |title=Porting and evaluation of automatic summarization|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277288103}}\n*{{cite book |last=Roxana |first=Angheluta |year=2002 |title=The Use of Topic Segmentation for Automatic Summarization|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2553088}}\n*{{cite book |last=Anne |first=Buist |year=2004 |title=Automatic Summarization of Meeting Data: A Feasibility Study|url=http://www.cs.ru.nl/~kraaijw/pubs/Biblio/papers/meeting_sum_tno.pdf}}\n*{{cite book |last=Annie |first=Louis |year=2009 |title=Performance Confidence Estimation for Automatic Summarization|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1762&context=cis_papers}}\n*{{cite book |last=Elena |first=Lloret and Manuel, Palomar  |year=2009 |title=Challenging Issues of Automatic Summarization: Relevance Detection and Quality-based Evaluation|url=http://www.informatica.si/ojs-2.4.3/index.php/informatica/article/download/273/269}}\n*{{cite book |last=Andrew |first=Goldberg |year=2007 |title=Automatic Summarization}}\n*{{cite book |last=Alrehamy |first=Hassan |year=2017 |title=Automatic Keyphrases Extraction |volume=650 |pages=222\u2013235 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-66939-7_19 |chapter=SemCluster: Unsupervised Automatic Keyphrase Extraction Using Affinity Propagation |series=Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing |isbn=978-3-319-66938-0 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Endres-Niggemeyer |first=Brigitte |year=1998 |title=Summarizing Information |url=https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-642-72025-3 |isbn=978-3-540-63735-6}}\n*{{cite book |last=Marcu |first=Daniel |year=2000 |title=The Theory and Practice of Discourse Parsing and Summarization |isbn=978-0-262-13372-2}}\n*{{cite book |last=Mani |first=Inderjeet |year=2001 |title=Automatic Summarization |isbn=978-1-58811-060-2}}\n*{{cite book |last=Huff |first=Jason |year=2010 |title=AutoSummarize |url=http://www.jason-huff.com/projects/autosummarize/}}, Conceptual artwork using automatic summarization software in Microsoft Word 2008.\n*{{cite book |last=Lehmam |first=Abderrafih |year=2010 |title=Essential summarizer: innovative automatic text summarization software in twenty languages - ACM Digital Library |pages=216\u2013217 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1937055.1937111&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=23185814&CFTOKEN=40272014/|series=Riao '10 }}, Published in Proceeding RIAO'10 Adaptivity, Personalization and Fusion of Heterogeneous Information, CID Paris, France\n*{{cite book |last=Xiaojin |first=Zhu, Andrew Goldberg, Jurgen Van Gael, and David Andrzejewski |year=2007 |title=Improving diversity in ranking using absorbing random walks |url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/grasshopper.pdf}}, The GRASSHOPPER algorithm\n*{{cite book |last=Miranda-Jim\u00e9nez |first=Sabino, Gelbukh, Alexander, and Sidorov, Grigori |year=2013 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35786-2_18 |title=Conceptual Structures for STEM Research and Education |volume=7735 |pages=245\u2013253 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |isbn=978-3-642-35785-5 |chapter=Summarizing Conceptual Graphs for Automatic Summarization Task }}, Conceptual Structures for STEM Research and Education.\n\n{{Natural Language Processing}}\n\n[[Category:Computational linguistics]]\n[[Category:Natural language processing]]\n[[Category:Tasks of natural language processing]]\n[[Category:Data mining]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=March 2015}}\n{{tone|date=March 2015}}\n}}\n\n'''Automatic summarization''' is the process of shortening a set of data computationally, to create a subset (a [[Abstract (summary)|summary]]) that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content. \n\nIn addition to text, images and videos can also be summarized. Text summarization finds the most informative sentences in a document; image summarization finds the most representative images within an image collection {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}; video summarization extracts the most important frames from the video content.<ref name=\"PalPetrosino2012\">{{cite book|author1=Sankar K.

Examples of extracted content include key-phrases that can be used to \"tag\" or index a text document, or key sentences (including headings) that collectively comprise an abstract, and representative images or video segments, as stated above. For text, extraction is analogous to the process of skimming, where the summary (if available), headings and subheadings, figures, the first and last paragraphs of a section, and optionally the first and last sentences in a paragraph are read before one chooses to read the entire document in detail.<ref> Richard Sutz, Peter Weverka. How to skim text. https://www.dummies.com/education/language-arts/speed-reading/how-to-skim-text/ Accessed Dec 2019. </ref>\n\n===Abstraction-based summarization===\n\nThis has been applied mainly for text. Abstractive methods build an internal semantic representation of the original content, and then use this representation to create a summary that is closer to what a human might express. Abstraction may transform the extracted content by [[automated paraphrasing|paraphrasing]] sections of the source document, to condense a text more strongly than extraction. Such transformation, however, is computationally much more challenging than extraction, involving both [[natural language processing]] and often a deep understanding of the domain of the original text in cases where the original document relates to a special field of knowledge.\n\"Paraphrasing\" is even more difficult to apply to image and video, which is why most summarization systems are extractive.\n\n===Aided summarization===\n\nApproaches aimed at higher summarization quality rely on combined software and human effort. In Machine Aided Human Summarization, extractive techniques highlight candidate passages for inclusion (to which the human adds or removes text). In Human Aided Machine Summarization, a human post-processes software output, in the same way that one edits the output of automatic translation by Google Translate.\n\n==Applications and systems for summarization==\n<!--needs to make more clear about how to categorize the type of summaries-->\n\nThere are broadly two types of extractive summarization tasks depending on what the summarization program focuses on. The first is ''generic summarization'', which focuses on obtaining a generic summary or abstract of the collection (whether documents, or sets of images, or videos, news stories etc.). The second is  ''query relevant summarization'', sometimes called ''query-based summarization'', which summarizes objects specific to a query. Summarization systems are able to create both query relevant text summaries and generic machine-generated summaries depending on what the user needs.\n\nAn example of a summarization problem is document summarization, which attempts to automatically produce an abstract from a given document. Sometimes one might be interested in generating a summary from a single source document, while others can use multiple source documents (for example, a [[cluster analysis|cluster]] of articles on the same topic). This problem is called [[multi-document summarization]]. A related application is summarizing news articles. Imagine a system, which automatically pulls together news articles on a given topic (from the web), and concisely represents the latest news as a summary.\n\nImage collection summarization is another application example of automatic summarization. It consists in selecting a representative set of images from a larger set of images.<ref>Jorge E. Camargo and Fabio A. Gonz\u00e1lez. A Multi-class Kernel Alignment Method for Image Collection Summarization. In Proceedings of the 14th Iberoamerican Conference on Pattern Recognition: Progress in Pattern Recognition, Image Analysis, Computer Vision, and Applications (CIARP '09), Eduardo Bayro-Corrochano and Jan-Olof Eklundh (Eds.). Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, 545-552.  {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-642-10268-4_64}}</ref> A summary in this context is useful to show the most representative images of results in an [[image collection exploration]] system. Video summarization is a related domain, where the system automatically creates a trailer of a long video. This also has applications in consumer or personal videos, where one might want to skip the boring or repetitive actions. Similarly, in surveillance videos, one would want to extract important and suspicious activity, while ignoring all the boring and redundant frames captured.\n\nAt a very high level, summarization algorithms try to find subsets of objects (like set of sentences, or a set of images), which cover information of the entire set. This is also called the ''core-set''. These algorithms model notions like diversity, coverage, information and representativeness of the summary. Query based summarization techniques, additionally model for relevance of the summary with the query. Some techniques and algorithms which naturally model summarization problems are TextRank and PageRank, [[Submodular set function]], [[Determinantal point process]], maximal marginal relevance (MMR) etc.\n\n===Keyphrase extraction===\nThe task is the following. You are given a piece of text, such as a journal article, and you must produce a list of keywords or key[phrase]s that capture the primary topics discussed in the text.<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-66939-7_19|chapter = SemCluster: Unsupervised Automatic Keyphrase Extraction Using Affinity Propagation|title = Advances in Computational Intelligence Systems|volume = 650|pages = 222\u2013235|series = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|year = 2018|last1 = Alrehamy|first1 = Hassan H|last2 = Walker|first2 = Coral|isbn = 978-3-319-66938-0}}</ref> In the case of [[research article]]s, many authors provide manually assigned keywords, but most text lacks pre-existing keyphrases. For example, news articles rarely have keyphrases attached, but it would be useful to be able to automatically do so for a number of applications discussed below.\nConsider the example text from a news article:\n\n:\"The Army Corps of Engineers, rushing to meet President Bush's promise to protect New Orleans by the start of the 2006 hurricane season, installed defective flood-control pumps last year despite warnings from its own expert that the equipment would fail during a storm, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press\".\n\nA keyphrase extractor might select \"Army Corps of Engineers\", \"President Bush\", \"New Orleans\", and \"defective flood-control pumps\" as keyphrases. These are pulled directly from the text. In contrast, an abstractive keyphrase system would somehow internalize the content and generate keyphrases that do not appear in the text, but more closely resemble what a human might produce, such as \"political negligence\" or \"inadequate protection from floods\". Abstraction requires a deep [[natural language understanding|understanding of the text]], which makes it difficult for a computer system.\nKeyphrases have many applications. They can enable document browsing by providing a short summary, improve [[information retrieval]] (if documents have keyphrases assigned, a user could search by keyphrase to produce more reliable hits than a [[full-text search]]), and be employed in generating index entries for a large text corpus.\n\nDepending on the different literature and the definition of key terms, words or phrases, [[keyword extraction]] is a highly related theme.\n\n====Supervised learning approaches====\nBeginning with the work of Turney,<ref>{{Cite journal |arxiv = cs/0212020|last1 = Turney|first1 = Peter D|title = Learning Algorithms for Keyphrase Extraction|journal = Information Retrieval, )|volume = 2|issue = 4|pages = 303\u2013336|year = 2002|doi = 10.1023/A:1009976227802}}</ref> many researchers have approached keyphrase extraction as a [[supervised machine learning]] problem.\nGiven a document, we construct an example for each [[unigram]], [[bigram]], and trigram found in the text (though other text units are also possible, as discussed below). We then compute various features describing each example (e.g., does the phrase begin with an upper-case letter?). We assume there are known keyphrases available for a set of training documents. Using the known keyphrases, we can assign positive or negative labels to the examples. Then we learn a classifier that can discriminate between positive and negative examples as a function of the features. Some classifiers make a [[binary classification]] for a test example, while others assign a probability of being a keyphrase. For instance, in the above text, we might learn a rule that says phrases with initial capital letters are likely to be keyphrases.\nAfter training a learner, we can select keyphrases for test documents in the following manner. We apply the same example-generation strategy to the test documents, then run each example through the learner. We can determine the keyphrases by looking at binary classification decisions or probabilities returned from our learned model. If probabilities are given, a threshold is used to select the keyphrases.\nKeyphrase extractors are generally evaluated using precision and recall. Precision measures how\nmany of the proposed keyphrases are actually correct. Recall measures how many of the true\nkeyphrases your system proposed. The two measures can be combined in an F-score, which is the\nharmonic mean of the two (''F''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''PR''/(''P''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''R'') ). Matches between the proposed keyphrases and the known keyphrases can be checked after stemming or applying some other text normalization.\n\nDesigning a supervised keyphrase extraction system involves deciding on several choices (some of these apply to unsupervised, too). The first choice is exactly how to generate examples. Turney and others have used all possible unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams without intervening punctuation and after removing stopwords. Hulth showed that you can get some improvement by selecting examples to be sequences of tokens that match certain patterns of part-of-speech tags. Ideally, the mechanism for generating examples produces all the known labeled keyphrases as candidates, though this is often not the case. For example, if we use only unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, then we will never be able to extract a known keyphrase containing four words. Thus, recall may suffer. However, generating too many examples can also lead to low precision.\n\nWe also need to create features that describe the examples and are informative enough to allow a learning algorithm to discriminate keyphrases from non- keyphrases. Typically features involve various term frequencies (how many times a phrase appears in the current text or in a larger corpus), the length of the example, relative position of the first occurrence, various boolean syntactic features (e.g., contains all caps), etc. The Turney paper used about 12 such features. Hulth uses a reduced set of features, which were found most successful in the KEA (Keyphrase Extraction Algorithm) work derived from Turney\u2019s seminal paper.\n\nIn the end, the system will need to return a list of keyphrases for a test document, so we need to have a way to limit the number. Ensemble methods (i.e., using votes from several classifiers) have been used to produce numeric scores that can be thresholded to provide a user-provided number of keyphrases. This is the technique used by Turney with C4.5 decision trees. Hulth used a single binary classifier so the learning algorithm implicitly determines the appropriate number.\n\nOnce examples and features are created, we need a way to learn to predict keyphrases. Virtually any supervised learning algorithm could be used, such as decision trees, [[Naive Bayes]], and rule induction. In the case of Turney's GenEx algorithm, a [[genetic algorithm]] is used to learn parameters for a domain-specific keyphrase extraction algorithm. The extractor follows a series of heuristics to identify keyphrases. The genetic algorithm optimizes parameters for these heuristics with respect to performance on training documents with known key phrases.\n\n====Unsupervised approach: TextRank====\nAnother keyphrase extraction algorithm is TextRank. While supervised methods have some nice properties, like being able to produce interpretable rules for what features characterize a keyphrase, they also require a large amount of [[training set|training data]]. Many documents with known keyphrases are needed. Furthermore, training on a specific domain tends to customize the extraction process to that domain, so the resulting classifier is not necessarily portable, as some of Turney's results demonstrate.\nUnsupervised keyphrase extraction removes the need for training data. It approaches the problem from a different angle. Instead of trying to learn explicit features that characterize keyphrases, the TextRank algorithm<ref>Rada Mihalcea and Paul Tarau, 2004: ''TextRank: Bringing Order into Texts'', Department of Computer Science University of North Texas {{cite web|url=http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/acl2004/emnlp/pdf/Mihalcea.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617170501/http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/acl2004/emnlp/pdf/Mihalcea.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-17 }}</ref> exploits the structure of the text itself to determine keyphrases that appear \"central\" to the text in the same way that [[PageRank]] selects important Web pages. Recall this is based on the notion of \"prestige\" or \"recommendation\" from [[social network]]s. In this way, TextRank does not rely on any previous training data at all, but rather can be run on any arbitrary piece of text, and it can produce output simply based on the text's intrinsic properties. Thus the algorithm is easily portable to new domains and languages.\n\nTextRank is a general purpose [[Graph (abstract data type)|graph]]-based ranking algorithm for [[natural language processing|NLP]]. Essentially, it runs PageRank on a graph specially designed for a particular NLP task. For keyphrase extraction, it builds a graph using some set of text units as vertices. Edges are based on some measure of semantic or [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] [[semantic similarity|similarity]] between the text unit vertices. Unlike PageRank, the edges are typically undirected and can be weighted to reflect a degree of similarity. Once the graph is constructed, it is used to form a stochastic matrix, combined with a damping factor (as in the \"random surfer model\"), and the ranking over vertices is obtained by finding the eigenvector corresponding to [[eigenvalue]] 1 (i.e., the [[stationary distribution]] of the [[random walk]] on the graph).\n\nThe vertices should correspond to what we want to rank. Potentially, we could do something similar to the supervised methods and create a vertex for each unigram, bigram, trigram, etc. However, to keep the graph small, the authors decide to rank individual unigrams in a first step, and then include a second step that merges highly ranked adjacent unigrams to form multi-word phrases. This has a nice side effect of allowing us to produce keyphrases of arbitrary length. For example, if we rank unigrams and find that \"advanced\", \"natural\", \"language\", and \"processing\" all get high ranks, then we would look at the original text and see that these words appear consecutively and create a final keyphrase using all four together. Note that the unigrams placed in the graph can be filtered by part of speech. The authors found that adjectives and nouns were the best to include. Thus, some linguistic knowledge comes into play in this step.\n\nEdges are created based on word [[co-occurrence]] in this application of TextRank. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the [[unigram]]s appear within a window of size N in the original text. N is typically around 2\u201310. Thus, \"natural\" and \"language\" might be linked in a text about NLP. \"Natural\" and \"processing\" would also be linked because they would both appear in the same string of N words. These edges build on the notion of \"text [[Cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]]\" and the idea that words that appear near each other are likely related in a meaningful way and \"recommend\" each other to the reader.\n\nSince this method simply ranks the individual vertices, we need a way to threshold or produce a limited number of keyphrases. The technique chosen is to set a count T to be a user-specified fraction of the total number of vertices in the graph. Then the top T vertices/unigrams are selected based on their stationary probabilities. A post- processing step is then applied to merge adjacent instances of these T unigrams. As a result, potentially more or less than T final keyphrases will be produced, but the number should be roughly proportional to the length of the original text.\n\nIt is not initially clear why applying PageRank to a co-occurrence graph would produce useful keyphrases. One way to think about it is the following. A word that appears multiple times throughout a text may have many different co-occurring neighbors. For example, in a text about machine learning, the unigram \"learning\" might co-occur with \"machine\", \"supervised\", \"un-supervised\", and \"semi-supervised\" in four different sentences. Thus, the \"learning\" vertex would be a central \"hub\" that connects to these other modifying words. Running PageRank/TextRank on the graph is likely to rank \"learning\" highly. Similarly, if the text contains the phrase \"supervised classification\", then there would be an edge between \"supervised\" and \"classification\". If \"classification\" appears several other places and thus has many neighbors, its importance would contribute to the importance of \"supervised\". If it ends up with a high rank, it will be selected as one of the top T unigrams, along with \"learning\" and probably \"classification\". In the final post-processing step, we would then end up with keyphrases \"supervised learning\" and \"supervised classification\".\n\nIn short, the co-occurrence graph will contain densely connected regions for terms that appear often and in different contexts. A random walk on this graph will have a stationary distribution that assigns large probabilities to the terms in the centers of the clusters. This is similar to densely connected Web pages getting ranked highly by PageRank. This approach has also been used in document summarization, considered below.\n\n===Document summarization===\nLike keyphrase extraction, document summarization aims to identify the essence of a text. The only real difference is that now we are dealing with larger text units\u2014whole sentences instead of words and phrases.\n\nBefore getting into the details of some summarization methods, we will mention how summarization systems are typically evaluated. The most common way is using the so-called [[ROUGE (metric)|ROUGE]] (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measure. This is a recall-based measure that determines how well a system-generated summary covers the content present in one or more human-generated model summaries known as references. It is recall-based to encourage systems to include all the important topics in the text. Recall can be computed with respect to unigram, bigram, trigram, or 4-gram matching. For example, ROUGE-1 is computed as division of count of unigrams in reference that appear in system and count of unigrams in reference summary.\n\nIf there are multiple references, the ROUGE-1 scores are averaged. Because ROUGE is based only on content overlap, it can determine if the same general concepts are discussed between an automatic summary and a reference summary, but it cannot determine if the result is coherent or the sentences flow together in a sensible manner. High-order n-gram ROUGE measures try to judge fluency to some degree.\nNote that ROUGE is similar to the BLEU measure for machine translation, but BLEU is precision- based, because translation systems favor accuracy.\n\nA promising line in document summarization is adaptive document/text summarization.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.3103/S0005105510030027|title = Automatic genre recognition and adaptive text summarization| journal=Automatic Documentation and Mathematical Linguistics| volume=44| issue=3| pages=111\u2013120|year = 2010|last1 = Yatsko|first1 = V. A.| last2=Starikov| first2=M. S.| last3=Butakov| first3=A. V.}}</ref> The idea of adaptive summarization involves preliminary recognition of document/text genre and subsequent application of summarization algorithms optimized for this genre. First summarizes that perform adaptive summarization have been created.<ref>[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/universal-summarizer-unis.html UNIS (Universal Summarizer)]</ref>\n\n====Supervised learning approaches====\nSupervised text summarization is very much like supervised keyphrase extraction. Basically, if you have a collection of documents and human-generated summaries for them, you can learn features of sentences that make them good candidates for inclusion in the summary. Features might include the position in the document (i.e., the first few sentences are probably important), the number of words in the sentence, etc. The main difficulty in supervised extractive summarization is that the known summaries must be manually created by extracting sentences so the sentences in an original training document can be labeled as \"in summary\" or \"not in summary\". This is not typically how people create summaries, so simply using journal abstracts or existing summaries is usually not sufficient. The sentences in these summaries do not necessarily match up with sentences in the original text, so it would be difficult to assign labels to examples for training. Note, however, that these natural summaries can still be used for evaluation purposes, since ROUGE-1 only cares about unigrams.\n\n====Maximum entropy-based summarization====\nDuring the DUC 2001 and 2002 evaluation workshops, [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] developed a sentence extraction system for multi-document summarization in the news domain. The system was based on a hybrid system using a [[naive Bayes]] classifier and statistical language models for modeling salience. Although the system exhibited good results, the researchers wanted to explore the effectiveness of a [[maximum entropy classifier|maximum entropy]] (ME) classifier for the meeting summarization task, as ME is known to be robust against feature dependencies. Maximum entropy has also been applied successfully for summarization in the broadcast news domain.\n\n====TextRank and LexRank====\nThe unsupervised approach to summarization is also quite similar in spirit to unsupervised keyphrase extraction and gets around the issue of costly training data. Some unsupervised summarization approaches are based on finding a \"[[centroid]]\" sentence, which is the mean word vector of all the sentences in the document. Then the sentences can be ranked with regard to their similarity to this centroid sentence.\n\nA more principled way to estimate sentence importance is using random walks and eigenvector centrality. LexRank<ref>G\u00fcne\u015f Erkan and Dragomir R. Radev: ''LexRank: Graph-based Lexical Centrality as Salience in Text Summarization [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume22/erkan04a-html/erkan04a.html]''</ref> is an algorithm essentially identical to TextRank, and both use this approach for document summarization. The two methods were developed by different groups at the same time, and LexRank simply focused on summarization, but could just as easily be used for keyphrase extraction or any other NLP ranking task.\n\nIn both LexRank and TextRank, a graph is constructed by creating a vertex for each sentence in the document.\n\nThe edges between sentences are based on some form of semantic similarity or content overlap. While LexRank uses [[cosine similarity]] of [[TF-IDF]] vectors, TextRank uses a very similar measure based on the number of words two sentences have in common ([[Quantile normalization|normalized]] by the sentences' lengths). The LexRank paper explored using unweighted edges after applying a threshold to the cosine values, but also experimented with using edges with weights equal to the similarity score. TextRank uses continuous [[similarity score]]s as weights.\n\nIn both algorithms, the sentences are ranked by applying PageRank to the resulting graph. A summary is formed by combining the top ranking sentences, using a threshold or length cutoff to limit the size of the summary.\n\nIt is worth noting that TextRank was applied to summarization exactly as described here, while LexRank was used as part of a larger summarization system ([[MEAD]]) that combines the LexRank score (stationary probability) with other features like sentence position and length using a [[linear combination]] with either user-specified or automatically tuned weights. In this case, some training documents might be needed, though the TextRank results show the additional features are not absolutely necessary.\n\nAnother important distinction is that TextRank was used for single document summarization, while LexRank has been applied to multi-document summarization. The task remains the same in both cases\u2014only the number of sentences to choose from has grown. However, when summarizing multiple documents, there is a greater risk of selecting duplicate or highly redundant sentences to place in the same summary. Imagine you have a cluster of news articles on a particular event, and you want to produce one summary. Each article is likely to have many similar sentences, and you would only want to include distinct ideas in the summary. To address this issue, LexRank applies a heuristic post-processing step that builds up a summary by adding sentences in rank order, but discards any sentences that are too similar to ones already placed in the summary. The method used is called Cross-Sentence Information Subsumption (CSIS).\n\nThese methods work based on the idea that sentences \"recommend\" other similar sentences to the reader. Thus, if one sentence is very similar to many others, it will likely be a sentence of great importance. The importance of this sentence also stems from the importance of the sentences \"recommending\" it. Thus, to get ranked highly and placed in a summary, a sentence must be similar to many sentences that are in turn also similar to many other sentences. This makes intuitive sense and allows the algorithms to be applied to any arbitrary new text. The methods are domain-independent and easily portable. One could imagine the features indicating important sentences in the news domain might vary considerably from the biomedical domain. However, the unsupervised \"recommendation\"-based approach applies to any domain.\n\n====Multi-document summarization====\n{{Main|Multi-document summarization}}\n'''Multi-document summarization''' is an automatic procedure aimed at extraction of information from multiple texts written about the same topic. Resulting summary report allows individual users, such as professional information consumers, to quickly familiarize themselves with information contained in a large cluster of documents. In such a way, multi-document summarization systems are complementing the [[news aggregators]] performing the next step down the road of coping with [[information overload]]. Multi-document summarization may also be done in response to a question.<ref>\"[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis]\", International Journal of Intelligent Information Database Systems, 5(2), 119-142, 2011.</ref>\n\nMulti-document summarization creates information reports that are both concise and comprehensive. With different opinions being put together and outlined, every topic is described from multiple perspectives within a single document. While the goal of a brief summary is to simplify information search and cut the time by pointing to the most relevant source documents, comprehensive multi-document summary should itself contain the required information, hence limiting the need for accessing original files to cases when refinement is required.\nAutomatic summaries present information extracted from multiple sources algorithmically, without any editorial touch or subjective human intervention, thus making it completely unbiased. {{dubious|date=June 2018}}\n\n=====Incorporating diversity=====\nMulti-document extractive summarization faces a problem of potential redundancy. Ideally, we would like to extract sentences that are both \"central\" (i.e., contain the main ideas) and \"diverse\" (i.e., they differ from one another). LexRank deals with diversity as a heuristic final stage using CSIS, and other systems have used similar methods, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR),<ref>Carbonell, Jaime, and Jade Goldstein. \"[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/.cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/jgc/publication/MMR_DiversityBased_Reranking_SIGIR_1998.pdf The use of MMR, diversity-based reranking for reordering documents and producing summaries].\" Proceedings of the 21st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval. ACM, 1998.</ref> in trying to eliminate redundancy in information retrieval results. There is a general purpose graph-based ranking algorithm like Page/Lex/TextRank that handles both \"centrality\" and \"diversity\" in a unified mathematical framework based on [[absorbing Markov chain]] random walks. (An absorbing random walk is like a standard random walk, except some states are now absorbing states that act as \"black holes\" that cause the walk to end abruptly at that state.) The algorithm is called GRASSHOPPER.<ref>Zhu, Xiaojin, et al. \"[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N07-1013 Improving Diversity in Ranking using Absorbing Random Walks].\" HLT-NAACL. 2007.</ref> In addition to explicitly promoting diversity during the ranking process, GRASSHOPPER incorporates a prior ranking (based on sentence position in the case of summarization).\n\nThe state of the art results for multi-document summarization, however, are obtained using mixtures of submodular functions. These methods have achieved the state of the art results for Document Summarization Corpora, DUC 04 - 07.<ref>Hui Lin, Jeff Bilmes. \"[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.4871 Learning mixtures of submodular shells with application to document summarization]</ref> Similar results were also achieved with the use of determinantal point processes (which are a special case of submodular functions) for DUC-04.<ref>Alex Kulesza and Ben Taskar, [http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/DownloadSummary/MAL-044 Determinantal point processes for machine learning]. Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning, December 2012.</ref>\n\nA new method for multi-lingual multi-document summarization that avoids redundancy works by simplifying and generating ideograms that represent the meaning of each sentence in each document and then evaluates similarity \"qualitatively\" by comparing the shape and position of said ideograms has recently been developed. This tool does not use word frequency, does not need training or preprocessing of any kind and works by generating ideograms that represent the meaning of each sentence and then summarizes using two user-supplied parameters: equivalence (when are two sentences to be considered equivalent) and relevance (how long is the desired summary).\n\n===Submodular functions as generic tools for summarization===\nThe idea of a [[submodular set function]] has recently emerged as a powerful modeling tool for various summarization problems. Submodular functions naturally model notions of ''coverage'', ''information'', ''representation'' and ''diversity''. Moreover, several important [[combinatorial optimization]] problems occur as special instances of submodular optimization. For example, the [[set cover problem]] is a special case of submodular optimization, since the set cover function is submodular. The set cover function attempts to find a subset of objects which ''cover'' a given set of concepts. For example, in document summarization, one would like the summary to cover all important and relevant concepts in the document. This is an instance of set cover. Similarly, the [[facility location problem]] is a special case of submodular functions. The Facility Location function also naturally models coverage and diversity. Another example of a submodular optimization problem is using a [[determinantal point process]] to model diversity. Similarly, the Maximum-Marginal-Relevance procedure can also be seen as an instance of submodular optimization. All these important models encouraging coverage, diversity and information are all submodular. Moreover, submodular functions can be efficiently combined together, and the resulting function is still submodular. Hence, one could combine one submodular function which models diversity, another one which models coverage and use human supervision to learn a right model of a submodular function for the problem.\n\nWhile submodular functions are fitting problems for summarization, they also admit very efficient algorithms for optimization. For example, a simple [[greedy algorithm]] admits a constant factor guarantee.<ref>Nemhauser, George L., Laurence A. Wolsey, and Marshall L. Fisher. \"An analysis of approximations for maximizing submodular set functions\u2014I.\" Mathematical Programming 14.1 (1978): 265-294.</ref> Moreover, the greedy algorithm is extremely simple to implement and can scale to large datasets, which is very important for summarization problems.\n\nSubmodular functions have achieved state-of-the-art for almost all summarization problems. For example, work by Lin and Bilmes, 2012<ref>Hui Lin, Jeff Bilmes. \"[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.4871 Learning mixtures of submodular shells with application to document summarization]\", UAI, 2012</ref> shows that submodular functions achieve the best results to date on DUC-04, DUC-05, DUC-06 and DUC-07 systems for document summarization. Similarly, work by Lin and Bilmes, 2011,<ref>Hui Lin, Jeff Bilmes. \"[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1052 A Class of Submodular Functions for Document Summarization]\", The 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (ACL-HLT), 2011</ref> shows that many existing systems for automatic summarization are instances of submodular functions. This was a breakthrough result establishing submodular functions as the right models for summarization problems.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nSubmodular Functions have also been used for other summarization tasks. Tschiatschek et al., 2014 show<ref>Sebastian Tschiatschek, Rishabh Iyer, Hoachen Wei and Jeff Bilmes, [http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5415-learning-mixtures-of-submodular-functions-for-image-collection-summarization.pdf Learning Mixtures of Submodular Functions for Image Collection Summarization], In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, December - 2014.</ref> that mixtures of submodular functions achieve state-of-the-art results for image collection summarization. Similarly, Bairi et al., 2015<ref>Ramakrishna Bairi, Rishabh Iyer, Ganesh Ramakrishnan and Jeff Bilmes, [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-1054 Summarizing Multi-Document Topic Hierarchies using Submodular Mixtures], To Appear In the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), Beijing, China, July - 2015</ref> show the utility of submodular functions for summarizing multi-document topic hierarchies. Submodular Functions have also successfully been used for summarizing machine learning datasets.<ref>Kai Wei, Rishabh Iyer, and Jeff Bilmes, [http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/wei15.pdf Submodularity in Data Subset Selection and Active Learning], To Appear In Proc.

Currently, it is not clear what the relation of evaluation is to any of the above topics. The following questions need to be answered: First, in the context of automatic summarization, what is evaluation?  Second, what is the significance of evaluation?  That is, what is evaluation used for?\n-->\nThe most common way to evaluate the informativeness of automatic summaries is to compare them with human-made model summaries.\n\nEvaluation techniques fall into intrinsic and extrinsic,<ref>[http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/workshop/OnlineProceedings2/sum-mani.pdf Mani, I. Summarization evaluation: an overview]</ref> inter-textual and intra-textual.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.3103/S0005105507030041|title = A method for evaluating modern systems of automatic text summarization| journal=Automatic Documentation and Mathematical Linguistics| volume=41| issue=3| pages=93\u2013103|year = 2007|last1 = Yatsko|first1 = V. A.| last2=Vishnyakov| first2=T. N.}}</ref>\n\n=== Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation ===\nAn intrinsic evaluation tests the summarization system in and of itself while an extrinsic evaluation tests the summarization based on how it affects the completion of some other task. Intrinsic evaluations have\nassessed mainly the coherence and informativeness of summaries. Extrinsic evaluations, on the other hand, have tested the impact of summarization on tasks like relevance assessment, reading comprehension, etc.\n\n=== Inter-textual and intra-textual ===\nIntra-textual methods assess the output of a specific summarization system, and the inter-textual ones focus on contrastive analysis of outputs of several summarization systems.\n\nHuman judgement often has wide variance on what is considered a \"good\" summary, which means that making the evaluation process automatic is particularly difficult. Manual evaluation can be used, but this is both time and labor-intensive as it requires humans to read not only the summaries but also the source documents. Other issues are those concerning [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] and coverage.\n\nOne of the metrics used in [[NIST]]'s annual Document Understanding Conferences, in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks, is the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation [https://web.archive.org/web/20060408135021/http://haydn.isi.edu/ROUGE/]). It essentially calculates [[n-gram]] overlaps between automatically generated summaries and previously-written human summaries. A high level of overlap should indicate a high level of shared concepts between the two summaries. Note that overlap metrics like this are unable to provide any feedback on a summary's coherence. [[anaphora (linguistics)|Anaphor resolution]] remains another problem yet to be fully solved. Similarly, for image summarization, Tschiatschek et al., developed a Visual-ROUGE score which judges the performance of algorithms for image summarization.<ref>Sebastian Tschiatschek, Rishabh Iyer, Hoachen Wei and Jeff Bilmes, [http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5415-learning-mixtures-of-submodular-functions-for-image-collection-summarization.pdf Learning Mixtures of Submodular Functions for Image Collection Summarization], In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, December - 2014. (PDF)</ref>\n\n===Domain specific versus domain independent summarization techniques===\nDomain independent summarization techniques generally apply sets of general features which can be used to identify information-rich text segments. Recent research focus has drifted to domain-specific summarization techniques that utilize the available knowledge specific to the domain of text. For example, automatic summarization research on medical text generally attempts to utilize the various sources of codified medical knowledge and ontologies.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Sarker|first1=Abeed|last2=Molla|first2=Diego|last3=Paris|first3=Cecile|title=An Approach for Query-focused Text Summarization for Evidence-based medicine|date=2013|volume=7885|pages=295\u2013304|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38326-7_41|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-642-38325-0}}</ref>\n\n===Evaluating summaries qualitatively===\nThe main drawback of the evaluation systems existing so far is that we need at least one reference summary, and for some methods more than one, to be able to compare automatic summaries with models. This is a hard and expensive task. Much effort has to be done in order to have corpus of texts and their corresponding summaries. Furthermore, for some methods, not only do we need to have human-made summaries available for comparison, but also manual annotation has to be performed in some of them (e.g. SCU in the Pyramid Method). In any case, what the evaluation methods need as an input, is a set of summaries to serve as gold standards and a set of automatic summaries. Moreover, they all perform a quantitative evaluation with regard to different similarity metrics.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sentence extraction]]\n* [[Text mining]]\n* [[Multi-document summarization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book |last=Hercules |first=Dalianis |year=2003 |title=Porting and evaluation of automatic summarization|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277288103}}\n*{{cite book |last=Roxana |first=Angheluta |year=2002 |title=The Use of Topic Segmentation for Automatic Summarization|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2553088}}\n*{{cite book |last=Anne |first=Buist |year=2004 |title=Automatic Summarization of Meeting Data: A Feasibility Study|url=http://www.cs.ru.nl/~kraaijw/pubs/Biblio/papers/meeting_sum_tno.pdf}}\n*{{cite book |last=Annie |first=Louis |year=2009 |title=Performance Confidence Estimation for Automatic Summarization|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1762&context=cis_papers}}\n*{{cite book |last=Elena |first=Lloret and Manuel, Palomar  |year=2009 |title=Challenging Issues of Automatic Summarization: Relevance Detection and Quality-based Evaluation|url=http://www.informatica.si/ojs-2.4.3/index.php/informatica/article/download/273/269}}\n*{{cite book |last=Andrew |first=Goldberg |year=2007 |title=Automatic Summarization}}\n*{{cite book |last=Alrehamy |first=Hassan |year=2017 |title=Automatic Keyphrases Extraction |volume=650 |pages=222\u2013235 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-66939-7_19 |chapter=SemCluster: Unsupervised Automatic Keyphrase Extraction Using Affinity Propagation |series=Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing |isbn=978-3-319-66938-0 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Endres-Niggemeyer |first=Brigitte |year=1998 |title=Summarizing Information |url=https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-642-72025-3 |isbn=978-3-540-63735-6}}\n*{{cite book |last=Marcu |first=Daniel |year=2000 |title=The Theory and Practice of Discourse Parsing and Summarization |isbn=978-0-262-13372-2}}\n*{{cite book |last=Mani |first=Inderjeet |year=2001 |title=Automatic Summarization |isbn=978-1-58811-060-2}}\n*{{cite book |last=Huff |first=Jason |year=2010 |title=AutoSummarize |url=http://www.jason-huff.com/projects/autosummarize/}}, Conceptual artwork using automatic summarization software in Microsoft Word 2008.\n*{{cite book |last=Lehmam |first=Abderrafih |year=2010 |title=Essential summarizer: innovative automatic text summarization software in twenty languages - ACM Digital Library |pages=216\u2013217 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1937055.1937111&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=23185814&CFTOKEN=40272014/|series=Riao '10 }}, Published in Proceeding RIAO'10 Adaptivity, Personalization and Fusion of Heterogeneous Information, CID Paris, France\n*{{cite book |last=Xiaojin |first=Zhu, Andrew Goldberg, Jurgen Van Gael, and David Andrzejewski |year=2007 |title=Improving diversity in ranking using absorbing random walks |url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/grasshopper.pdf}}, The GRASSHOPPER algorithm\n*{{cite book |last=Miranda-Jim\u00e9nez |first=Sabino, Gelbukh, Alexander, and Sidorov, Grigori |year=2013 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35786-2_18 |title=Conceptual Structures for STEM Research and Education |volume=7735 |pages=245\u2013253 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |isbn=978-3-642-35785-5 |chapter=Summarizing Conceptual Graphs for Automatic Summarization Task }}, Conceptual Structures for STEM Research and Education.\n\n{{Natural Language Processing}}\n\n[[Category:Computational linguistics]]\n[[Category:Natural language processing]]\n[[Category:Tasks of natural language processing]]\n[[Category:Data mining]]\n", "name_user": "Juan manuel torres", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization"}
