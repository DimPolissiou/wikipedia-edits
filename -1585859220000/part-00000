His grandfather died in 1924 and his eldest brother in 1927.\n\nMcKesson entered Harvard College in 1933 and experienced another death in 1936, this time that of his beloved sister Mary. Matriculated in 1937, he served as a second lieutenant during [[World War II]], marrying poet Madeline Mason at [[Fort McClellan, Alabama]] in 1942. Upon returning to New York, he began working in the family chemical company. This he would do until 1961, when with Mason's support he was able to retire from the business world and devote his life to his secret creation. Other than his early retirement, the couple led a conventional middle-class life in New York City, summering in the [[Catskills]] and serving on the boards of a variety of community organizations; none of their friends could ever have guessed at McKesson's other life.\n\nMadeline Mason died in 1990.

All of these are developed in his magnum opus, ''Matriarchy: Freedom in Bondage,'' a semi-autobiographical erotic novella that has been compared to such classics as ''[[Venus in Furs]]'' and ''[[Story of O]]''. \n\n''Matriarchy'' follows the sexual transformation of Harvard undergraduate Gerald Graham, who willingly subjects himself to the authority of the stern Lady Gladys. She teaches him to \"curb his manly nature\" by forcing him to take on the role and costume of a lady's maid named Rose. The house is a matriarchy because, as Lady Gladys explains, \"in this house all things feminine are blessed, all things masculine are bound in slavery\" (McKesson 1997, p.&nbsp;46). \n\nGerald's first transformation into Rose is described thus:\n\n\"From a closet she removed some padded silken forms. These were strapped tightly to his shoulders and waist, adding a more feminine shape to his thighs, breasts and buttocks. In this upholstery Rose was indeed a proper woman prepared to assume the black dress, the slip and the elegant apron of a serving maid\" (McKesson 1997, p.&nbsp;34).\n\nMuch of Gerald's training also involves elaborate [[bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]] devices such as the \"Walking Machine.\" This consists of two horizontal bars, the lower padded and at crotch-height and the upper with a collar in the middle of it. Gerald is fitted in high heels and fixed into the device, which \"rolls with greatest ease and steadies my body at the neck and at the crotch. If I miss my footing, it is painfully disciplinary\" (McKesson 1997, p.&nbsp;32). \n\nThe [[grammatical person|narrative voice]] shifts from first person into third person as Gerald subjects himself more and more to his lady's authority.\n\nHe is also given a bondage device to wear while away at Harvard, so that he can never truly forget his mistress. She straps him into \"a tight belt strapped around his waist... attached [to] a kind of suspender which passed over each shoulder and through the belt at his [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. This done, she moved the cord down to his thighs, looped it around his legs and tied them into a tight knot high up his thighs near his crotch. She felt the [[scrotum]] and was satisfied that all was smugly bound\" (McKesson 1997, p.&nbsp;73).\n\nAt the conclusion of the work, and the conclusion of Gerald's training, Lady Gladys and Gerald are united in a symbolic [[marriage]]. He repeats the pledge: \"I, Gerald Graham, surnamed Rose, do hereby submit myself, body, soul, and spirit, to the will and pleasure of my great mistress Gladys, to serve her all the days of her life. In token of this pledge, I herewith place my hands in hers in total submission\" (McKesson 1997, p.&nbsp;170). She replies, \"Now you are a man because you have your mistress... Together we shall do great things in the world\" (McKesson 1997, p.&nbsp;171).\n\n''Matriarchy'' is illustrated by hundreds of intensely worked [[ballpoint]] drawings. While McKesson was presumably in a state of great sexual excitement while crafting them, they are not pornographic in the least. Figures are defined vaguely, modeled by voluptuous and androgynous masses. The scribbles and hatch marks that make up the figures are also reminiscent of the [[chiaroscuro]] technique, and all of the scenes appear to take place in dim lighting.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Resources==\n*McKesson, Malcolm.

Subsequent legal actions by the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise that saw the Browns franchise, history, records, and intellectual property remain in Cleveland.

In exchange the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by the [[1999 NFL season|1999 season]] by adding a team or moving one from another city.

Although they had drawn respectable fan support during their two seasons in Baltimore, Stallions owner [[Jim Speros]] knew his team could not compete with an NFL team and opted to establish a new franchise in [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Klingaman|first=Mike|title=Once, the Stallions rode high|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-11-26/sports/0011260151_1_baltimore-stallions-grey-cup-stallions-won/2|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=November 26, 2000|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref> They subsequently adopted the name and assumed the history of the team that previously played in the city, the [[Montreal Alouettes|Alouettes]], who had ceased operations in 1987. Like the Browns, the Alouettes (who incidentally were originally founded in 1946, the same year as the Browns) were formally recognized as having resumed operations after a hiatus although unlike the Browns, the decision to reactivate the Montreal franchise in such a manner that it was considered a continuation of the previous franchise had not been previously planned and was made retroactively at the time of their revival. Much of the Stallions' roster and most of the Stallions' other football personnel made the move to Montreal, although unlike Modell, Speros was not formally given the sort of successor rights to existing contracts that would have allowed him to transplant his football organization to Montreal in the same manner was done from Cleveland to Baltimore - this would have been problematic due to the CFL's requirement that the re-activated Alouettes adhere to roster limits on American players (then called \"imports\") that the defunct U.S. CFL teams had not been bound to. The ability of Speros to retain the core of his championship roster to the point that the transaction superficially appeared to be a \"move\" was the result of a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between Speros and the other CFL teams. CFL commissioner [[Larry Smith (Canadian politician)|Larry Smith]], an Alouettes alumnus who was keen to ensure the revived Montreal franchise was an immediate contender, had pressured the other CFL teams to agree not to aggressively pursue what were technically [[free agent]]s.\n\nFocus groups, a telephone survey, and a fan contest were all held to help select a new name for Modell's team. Starting with a list of over 100 possible names, the team's management reduced it to 17. From there, focus groups of a total of 200 Baltimore area residents reduced the list of names to six, and then a phone survey of 1000 people trimmed it down to three, Marauders, Americans, and Ravens.

Although they had drawn respectable fan support during their two seasons in Baltimore, Stallions owner [[Jim Speros]] knew his team could not compete with an NFL team and opted to establish a new franchise in [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Klingaman|first=Mike|title=Once, the Stallions rode high|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-11-26/sports/0011260151_1_baltimore-stallions-grey-cup-stallions-won/2|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=November 26, 2000|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref> They subsequently adopted the name and assumed the history of the team that previously played in the city, the [[Montreal Alouettes|Alouettes]], who had ceased operations in 1987. Like the Browns, the Alouettes (who incidentally were originally founded in 1946, the same year as the Browns) were formally recognized as having resumed operations after a hiatus although unlike the Browns, the decision to reactivate the Montreal franchise in such a manner that it was considered a continuation of the previous franchise had not been previously planned and was made retroactively at the time of their revival. Much of the Stallions' roster and most of the Stallions' other football personnel made the move to Montreal, although unlike Modell, Speros was not formally given the sort of successor rights to existing contracts that would have allowed him to transplant his football organization to Montreal in the same manner was done from Cleveland to Baltimore - this would have been problematic due to the CFL's requirement that the re-activated Alouettes adhere to roster limits on American players (then called \"imports\") that the defunct U.S. CFL teams had not been bound to. The ability of Speros to retain the core of his championship roster to the point that the transaction superficially appeared to be a \"move\" was the result of a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between Speros and the other CFL teams. CFL commissioner [[Larry Smith (Canadian politician)|Larry Smith]], an Alouettes alumnus who was keen to ensure the revived Montreal franchise was an immediate contender, had pressured the other CFL teams to agree not to aggressively pursue what were technically [[free agent]]s.\n\nFocus groups, a telephone survey, and a fan contest were all held to help select a new name for Modell's team. Starting with a list of over 100 possible names, the team's management reduced it to 17. From there, focus groups of a total of 200 Baltimore area residents reduced the list of names to six, and then a phone survey of 1000 people trimmed it down to three, Marauders, Americans, and Ravens.

Thirteen years later, the [[Phoenix Coyotes bankruptcy and sale|Coyotes went bankrupt]] and were taken over by the league.

But when the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] came up for sale a year later, the league decided that there was no chance of finding an owner to operate a franchise in Georgia, so they arranged for True North to purchase the Atlanta franchise and move it to Winnipeg for the {{NHL Year|2011}} NHL season. The league decided to let True North and the [[Winnipeg Jets|new Jets]] use the identity of the old Winnipeg team, but not its history, which remained in Arizona with the Coyotes. The new Jets organization highlighted this change by quickly re-issuing the team's #9 jersey \u2014 retired by the old Jets in honor of superstar [[Bobby Hull]] \u2014 to forward [[Evander Kane]], who had worn the number in Atlanta.\n\n===National Basketball Association===\n*The [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|Seattle SuperSonics' move to Oklahoma City]] in 2008 included an agreement that the [[Seattle SuperSonics|SuperSonics]]' name, logo, colors, and history would all be left in [[Seattle]].

That team remained in Charlotte until moving to [[New Orleans]] after the {{nbay|2001|app=season}}, retaining the Hornets name.

After the New Orleans franchise changed its name to the [[New Orleans Pelicans|Pelicans]] after the {{nbay|2012|app=season}}, the Bobcats announced that they would reclaim the \"Hornets\" name effective with the {{nbay|2014|app=season}}. When the name change from Bobcats to Hornets became official in May 2014, it was also announced that the Hornets, Pelicans, and the NBA had reached an agreement that all history and records of the original Charlotte Hornets would be transferred to the revived Hornets. As a result, the Hornets are now considered to have been established in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 (as the Bobcats, then again changing their name back to the Hornets in 2014), while the Pelicans are now considered a 2002 expansion team.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Charlotte Hornets Name Returns to Carolinas|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/charlotte-hornets-name-returns-carolinas|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Relocation of professional sports teams]]\n* [[Cleveland sports curse]]\n* [[Browns\u2013Ravens rivalry]]\n* [[History of the Cleveland Browns]]\n* [[History of the Baltimore Ravens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|title=Cleveland Browns History|author=Henkel, Frank M.|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7385-3428-2|ref=CITEREFHenkel2005}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.latimes.com/sports/bal-modell121795,0,1763650,full.story Inside the Browns deal.] A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article on the Cleveland Browns' move.\n* {{YouTube|6J7Sc2Uaa0E|Cleveland Browns relocation}} on [[The NFL on NBC pregame show]].\n{{Cleveland Browns}}\n{{Baltimore Ravens}}\n{{NFL on NBC}}\n\n[[Category:National Football League controversies]]\n[[Category:Cleveland Browns]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Ravens]]\n[[Category:National Football League franchise relocations]]\n", "name_user": "Rupertslander", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSettlement", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns_relocation_controversy"}

This was in 1958, a time where the Iranian community was being politically isolated, in the face of an [[Iraqi Republic (1958\u201368)|Iraqi government]] that was raising the banner of [[Arab nationalism]].

Mirza Mahdi retorted, but this time with an angry tone, reminding Fuad, that it was us that ignited the 1920 revolt, and ended up kicking the British out, saving the independence and honour of Iraq.

He also claimed that it violated the liberty of man and the [[sharia]], and would create mental barriers within the minds of people.

Within six months, Iraq was turned into a blood bath of pro-communist protests, attacking the homes of religious clerics and nationalists. It was so bad, it is reported that a Muslim would feel estranged in a city like Najaf.\n\nOne time, a protest was formed in Karbala, with some of the leaders of the city's communist movement. They had a list of fifty two names (this included Mirza Mahdi's son [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi|Muhammad]]), of the people they planned to attack their homes and kill, for the reason that they 'stood against communism and the \"red tide\"'.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=al-Muhtadi|first=Abd al-Atheem|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9PjWAAAAMAAJ|title=Qusas Wa Khawatir - Min Akhlaqiyat 'Ulama' al-Din|publisher=Mu'asasat al-Balagh|year=2009|isbn=|location=Beirut, Lebanon|pages=552\u201353|trans-title=Stories and Memories - From the Manners of the Scholars}}</ref>\n\nThis is when the senior jurists of the time decided to take a stand to counter this wave of terror.
