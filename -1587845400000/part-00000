Although frequently encountered, the alternative spelling \"Tor\" is incorrect.\n\n==History==\nTorricelli attracted considerable attention when he demonstrated the first [[Barometer#Mercury barometers|mercury barometer]] to the general public. He is credited with giving the first modern explanation of atmospheric pressure. Scientists at the time were familiar with small fluctuations in height that occurred in barometers. When these fluctuations were explained as a manifestation of changes in atmospheric pressure, the science of [[meteorology]] was born.\n\nOver time, 760 millimeters of mercury at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C came to be regarded as the standard atmospheric pressure. In honour of Torricelli, the torr was defined as a unit of pressure equal to one millimeter of mercury at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, since the acceleration due to gravity \u2013 and thus the weight of a column of mercury \u2013 is a function of elevation and latitude (due to the rotation and non-[[sphericity]] of the Earth), this definition is imprecise and varies by location.\n\nIn 1954, the definition of the ''atmosphere'' was revised by the {{lang|fr|10<sup>e</sup> Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures}} (10th CGPM)<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/10/4/ BIPM \u2013 Resolution 4 of the 10th CGPM].</ref> to the currently accepted definition: one atmosphere is equal to {{val|101325|u=[[pascal (unit)|pascals]]}}. The torr was then redefined as {{sfrac|760}} of one atmosphere. This yields a precise definition that is unambiguous and independent of measurements of the density of mercury or the acceleration due to gravity on Earth.\n\n==Manometric units of pressure==\n\n{{See also|Pressure measurement#Liquid column}}\n\n''Manometric units'' are units such as ''millimeters of mercury'' or ''centimeters of water'' that depend on an assumed density of a fluid and an assumed acceleration due to gravity.  The use of these units is discouraged.<ref>[http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/faqs/pressure-units National Physical Laboratory: Pressure units].</ref>  Nevertheless, manometric units are routinely used in medicine and physiology, and they continue to be used in areas as diverse as weather reporting and scuba diving.\n\n==Conversion factors==\nThe millimeter of mercury by definition is {{val|133.322387415|u=Pa}}<ref>{{Cite book |url= |title=BS 350: Part 1: 1974 \u2013 Conversion factors and tables |last= |first= |date=1974 |publisher=[[British Standards Institution]] |year= |isbn= |location= |page=49 |pages=}}</ref> ({{val|13.5951|u=g/cm3}} \u00d7 {{val|9.80665|u=m/s2}} \u00d7 {{val|1|u=mm}}), which is approximated with known accuracies of density of mercury and [[standard gravity]].\n\nThe torr is defined as {{sfrac|760}} of one standard atmosphere, while the atmosphere is defined as {{val|101325}} pascals.  Therefore, 1 Torr is equal to {{sfrac|{{val|101325}}|760}}&nbsp;Pa.

They continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.\n\nRutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women's basketball programs, owning a 6-4 all-time [[bowl game|bowl]] record and appearing in a [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|National Final]] in 2007, respectively. In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home [[HighPoint.com Stadium]] on the [[Busch Campus of Rutgers University|Busch Campus]], and the basketball teams play at [[Louis Brown Athletic Center]] on [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston Campus]]. Both venues and campuses are located in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], immediately across the [[Raritan River]] from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]]. The university also fields rising men's basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers' fan base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], not to mention its alumni base, which is the largest in the state.\n\nRutgers' satellite campuses in Camden and Newark each field their own athletic programs. The [[Rutgers\u2013Camden]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Camden Scarlet Raptors|Scarlet Raptors]]. The [[Rutgers\u2013Newark]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Newark Scarlet Raiders|Scarlet Raiders]]. The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].\n\nSeton Hall, unlike Rutgers and Princeton, does not field a football team. Its men's basketball team, however, is one of the Big East's storied programs, New Jersey's most successful representative in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] by number of wins, the state's only men's basketball program to reach a modern [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|National Final]], and plays its home games at [[Prudential Center]] in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] approximately four miles from the university's [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] campus. The Pirates, while lacking as large an alumni base as the state university, have a large well of support in the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the [[Jersey Shore]]. The annual inter-conference rivalry game between Seton Hall and Rutgers which alternates between Newark and Piscataway, the Garden State Hardwood Classic, has been renewed through 2026.<ref>https://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2018/04/30/rutgers-seton-hall-basketball-garden-state-hardwood-classic/563768002/</ref>\n\n===Other schools===\nThe state's other Division I schools include the [[Monmouth Hawks|Monmouth University Hawks]] (West Long Branch), the [[NJIT Mens Soccer|New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders]] (Newark), the [[Rider University#Athletics|Rider University Broncs]] (Lawrenceville), and the [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey#Athletics|Saint Peter's University Peacocks and Peahens]] (Jersey City).\n\n[[Fairleigh Dickinson Knights|Fairleigh Dickinson University]] competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the [[Northeast Conference]] and NCAA Division I. The College at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the [[Middle Atlantic Conferences#Freedom Conference|Middle Atlantic Conferences' Freedom Conference]] and NCAA Division III.\n\nAmong the various Division III schools in the state, the [[Stevens Tech Ducks football|Stevens Institute of Technology]] Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men's lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.\n\n==High school sports==\nNew Jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]].(NJSIAA) <ref>[http://www.njsiaa.org/ NJSIAA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>'<ref>[http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ New Jersey High School News and Sports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418224118/http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ |date=2009-04-18 }}. iHigh.com, Inc \u2013 The High School Internet Network.

The organization is the youngest out of all nine \"Big Four\" major league teams within the New York Metropolitan Area and media market dominated in terms of ice hockey by the [[New York Rangers]] and [[New York Islanders|Islanders]] prior to the Devils' arrival, but has ultimately been successful in establishing a visible and dedicated following throughout the northern and central portions of the state.

In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home [[HighPoint.com Stadium]] on the [[Busch Campus of Rutgers University|Busch Campus]], and the basketball teams play at [[Louis Brown Athletic Center]] on [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston Campus]]. Both venues and campuses are located in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], immediately across the [[Raritan River]] from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]]. The university also fields rising men's basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers' fan base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], not to mention its alumni base, which is the largest in the state.\n\nRutgers' satellite campuses in Camden and Newark each field their own athletic programs. The [[Rutgers\u2013Camden]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Camden Scarlet Raptors|Scarlet Raptors]]. The [[Rutgers\u2013Newark]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Newark Scarlet Raiders|Scarlet Raiders]]. The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].\n\nSeton Hall, unlike Rutgers and Princeton, does not field a football team. Its men's basketball team, however, is one of the Big East's storied programs, New Jersey's most successful representative in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] by number of wins, the state's only men's basketball program to reach a modern [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|National Final]], and plays its home games at [[Prudential Center]] in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] approximately four miles from the university's [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] campus. The Pirates, while lacking as large an alumni base as the state university, have a large well of support in the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the [[Jersey Shore]]. The annual inter-conference rivalry game between Seton Hall and Rutgers which alternates between Newark and Piscataway, the Garden State Hardwood Classic, has been renewed through 2026.<ref>https://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2018/04/30/rutgers-seton-hall-basketball-garden-state-hardwood-classic/563768002/</ref>\n\n===Other schools===\nThe state's other Division I schools include the [[Monmouth Hawks|Monmouth University Hawks]] (West Long Branch), the [[NJIT Mens Soccer|New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders]] (Newark), the [[Rider University#Athletics|Rider University Broncs]] (Lawrenceville), and the [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey#Athletics|Saint Peter's University Peacocks and Peahens]] (Jersey City).\n\n[[Fairleigh Dickinson Knights|Fairleigh Dickinson University]] competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the [[Northeast Conference]] and NCAA Division I. The College at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the [[Middle Atlantic Conferences#Freedom Conference|Middle Atlantic Conferences' Freedom Conference]] and NCAA Division III.\n\nAmong the various Division III schools in the state, the [[Stevens Tech Ducks football|Stevens Institute of Technology]] Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men's lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.\n\n==High school sports==\nNew Jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]].(NJSIAA) <ref>[http://www.njsiaa.org/ NJSIAA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>'<ref>[http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ New Jersey High School News and Sports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418224118/http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ |date=2009-04-18 }}. iHigh.com, Inc \u2013 The High School Internet Network.

The traditional use has been for [[surveying|land surveying]], but they are also used extensively for [[Construction|building and infrastructure construction]], and some specialized applications such as [[meteorology]] and [[rocket launch]]ing.<ref>{{citation |title=Double Theodolite Pibal Evaluation by Computer |first=Norman |last=Thyer |date=March 1962 |journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=66\u201368 |publisher=American Meteorological Society |doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1962)001<0066:DTPEBC>2.0.CO;2 |doi-access=free }}</ref> \n\nIt consists of a moveable [[telescope]] mounted so it can rotate around horizontal and vertical [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] and provide angular readouts. These indicate the orientation of the telescope, and are used to relate the first point sighted through the telescope to subsequent sightings of other points from the same theodolite position. These angles can be measured with great accuracy, typically to [[milliradian]] or [[Minute and second of arc|seconds of arc]]. From these readings a plan can be drawn, or objects can be positioned in accordance with an existing plan. The modern theodolite has evolved into what is known as a [[total station]] where angles and distances are measured electronically, and are read directly to computer memory.   \n\nIn a transit theodolite, the telescope is short enough to rotate through the [[zenith]], otherwise for non-transit instruments vertical (or altitude), rotation is restricted to a limited arc. \n\nThe [[optical level]] is sometimes mistaken for a theodolite, but it does not measure vertical angles, and is used only for [[levelling]] on a [[horizontal plane]].\n\n== Principles of operation ==\n[[File:theodolite vermeer.svg|thumb|The axes and circles of a theodolite]]\n[[File:Optical Theodolite.jpg|thumb|Diagram of an optical readout theodolite]]\n\n===Preparation for making sightings===\n{{main|Temporary adjustments of theodolites}}\nTemporary adjustments are a set of operations necessary in order to make a theodolite ready for taking observations at a station. These include its setting up, centering, leveling up and elimination of parallax, and are achieved in four steps:\n\n* Setting up: fixing the theodolite onto a tripod along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. \n* Centering: bringing the vertical axis of theodolite immediately over station mark using a centering plate also known as a [[tribrach (instrument)|tribrach]].\n* Levelling: leveling of the base of the instrument to make the vertical axis vertical usually with an in-built bubble-level.\n* Focusing: removing [[parallax]] error by proper focusing of objective and eye-piece. The eye-piece only requires adjustment once at a station. The objective will be re-focused for each subsequent sightings from this station because of the different distances to the target.\n\n===Sightings===\nSightings are taken by the surveyor, who adjusts the telescope's vertical and horizontal angular orientation so the [[cross-hairs]] align with the desired sighting point. Both angles are read either from exposed or internal scales and recorded. The next object is then sighted and recorded without moving the position of the instrument and tripod.\n\nThe earliest angular readouts were from open [[vernier scale]]s directly visible to the eye. Gradually these scales were enclosed for physical protection, and finally became an indirect optical readout, with convoluted light paths to bring them to a convenient place on the instrument for viewing. The modern digital theodolites have electronic displays.\n\n=== Errors in measurement ===\n; Index error: The angles in the vertical axis should read 90[[degree (angle)|\u00b0]] (100 [[grad (angle)|grad]]) when the sight axis is horizontal, or 270\u00b0 (300 grad) when the instrument is transited. Half of the difference between the two positions is called the index error. This can only be checked on transit instruments.\n; Horizontal axis error: The horizontal and vertical axes of a theodolite must be perpendicular; if not then a horizontal axis error exists. This can be tested by aligning the tubular spirit bubble parallel to a line between two footscrews and setting the bubble central. A horizontal axis error is present if the bubble runs off central when the tubular spirit bubble is reversed (turned through 180\u00b0). To adjust, the operator removes half the amount the bubble has run off using the adjusting screw, then re-level, test and refine the adjustment.\n; Collimation error: The optical axis of the telescope, must also be perpendicular to the horizontal axis. If not, then a collimation error exists.\n\nIndex error, horizontal-axis error (''trunnion-axis error'') and collimation error are regularly determined by [[calibration]] and are removed by mechanical adjustment. Their existence is taken into account in the choice of measurement procedure in order to eliminate their effect on the measurement results of the theodolite.\n\n{{anchor|Half|Simple|Plain}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Universaltheodolit.14Zoll.Pistor&Martins.Berlin.1851.jpg|thumb|upright|A theodolite of 1851, showing the open construction, and the altitude and azimuth scales which are read directly.]]\n\nThe term ''diopter'' was sometimes used in old texts as a synonym for theodolite.<ref>''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, 1971 - see entry for ''diopter''</ref> This derives from an older astronomical instrument called a [[dioptra]].\n\nPrior to the theodolite, instruments such as the [[Groma surveying|groma]], [[geometric square]] and various other graduated circles (see [[circumferentor]]) and semicircles (see [[graphometer]]) were used to obtain either vertical or horizontal angle measurements. It was only a matter of time before someone put two measuring devices into a single instrument that could measure both angles simultaneously. [[Gregorius Reisch]] showed such an instrument in the appendix of his book ''Margarita Philosophica'', which he published in [[Strasbourg|Strasburg]] in 1512.<ref name=\"daumas\">Daumas, Maurice, ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989 {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}</ref> It was described in the appendix by [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]], a German [[topographer]] and [[cartographer]], who made the device in the same year.<ref name=\"geomaticaonline\"/> Waldseem\u00fcller called his instrument the ''polimetrum''.<ref name=\"mills\">Mills, John FitzMaurice, ''Encyclopedia of Antique Scientific Instruments'', Aurum Press, London, 1983, {{ISBN|0-906053-40-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Sectioned_theodolite.jpg|thumb|upright|Sectioned theodolite showing the complex light paths for optical readout, and the enclosed construction.]]\n\nThe first occurrence of the word \"theodolite\" is found in the [[surveying]] textbook ''A geometric practice named Pantometria'' (1571) by [[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]], which was published posthumously by his son, Thomas Digges.<ref name=\"daumas\"/> The [[etymology]] of the word is unknown.

Some identify the early theodolite as an [[azimuth]] instrument only, while others specify it as an [[altazimuth mount|altazimuth]] instrument. In Digges's book, the name \"theodolite\" described an instrument for measuring horizontal angles only. He also described an instrument that measured both altitude and azimuth, which he called a ''topographicall instrument'' {{sic}}.<ref name=\"turnerEIM\">Turner, Gerard L'E., ''Elizabethan Instrument Makers: The Origins of the London Trade in Precision Instrument Making'', Oxford University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-19-856566-6}}</ref> Thus the name originally applied only to the azimuth instrument and only later became associated with the altazimuth instrument. The 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' compares \"[[graphometer]]\" to \"half-theodolite\".<ref>''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', vol. 2 p. 50 for \"Semi-Circle\"</ref> Even as late as the 19th century, the instrument for measuring horizontal angles only was called a ''simple theodolite'' and the altazimuth instrument, the ''plain theodolite''.<ref name=\"turner\"/>\n\nThe first instrument more like a true theodolite was likely the one built by [[Joshua Habermel]] ([[Erasmus Habermehl]]) in Germany in 1576, complete with compass and tripod.<ref name=\"geomaticaonline\">{{ cite book| last1=Colombo|first1= Luigi|last2= Selvini|first2= Attilio|title=Sintesi di una storia degli strumenti per la misura topografica|date=1988|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113052943/http://geomatica.it/strumenti_antichi/estratto.htm|lang=it|trans-title=Summary of a history of topographic measurement tools}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest altazimuth instruments consisted of a base graduated with a full circle at the [[wikt:limb#Etymology 2|limb]] and a vertical angle measuring device, most often a semicircle. An [[alidade]] on the base was used to sight an object for horizontal angle measurement, and a second alidade was mounted on the vertical semicircle. Later instruments had a single alidade on the vertical semicircle and the entire semicircle was mounted so as to be used to indicate horizontal angles directly. Eventually, the simple, open-sight alidade was replaced with a sighting [[telescope]]. This was first done by [[Jonathan Sisson]] in 1725.<ref name=\"turner\"/>\n\nThe theodolite became a modern, accurate instrument in 1787, with the introduction of [[Jesse Ramsden]]'s famous [[Ramsden theodolite|great theodolite]], which he created using a very accurate [[dividing engine]] of his own design.<ref name=\"turner\">Turner, Gerard L'E. ''Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments'', Sotheby Publications, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85667-170-3}}</ref> The demand could not be met by foreign theodolites owing to their inadequate precision, hence all instruments meeting high precision requirements were made in England. Despite the many German instrument builders at the turn of the century, there were no usable German theodolites available. A transition was brought about by Breithaupt and the symbiosis of Utzschneider, Reichenbach and Fraunhofer.<ref>Ralf Kern: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit/Band 4: Perfektion von Optik und Mechanik. Cologne, 2010, pp. 349\u2013360.</ref> As technology progressed, in the 1840s, the vertical partial circle was replaced with a full circle, and both vertical and horizontal circles were finely graduated. This was the ''transit theodolite''. Theodolites were later adapted to a wider variety of mountings and uses. In the 1870s, an interesting waterborne version of the theodolite (using a pendulum device to counteract wave movement) was invented by [[Edward Samuel Ritchie]].<ref>American Academy of Arts and Sciences, ''Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'', Vol. XXIII, May 1895 \u2013 May 1896, Boston: University Press, John Wilson and Son (1896), pp. 359\u2013360</ref> It was used by the U.S. Navy to take the first precision surveys of American harbors on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.<ref>American Academy, pp. 359\u2013360</ref>\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, [[Heinrich Wild]] produced theodolites that became popular with surveyors. His Wild T2, T3, and A1 instruments were made for many years, and he would go on to develop the DK1, DKM1, DM2, DKM2, and DKM3 for Kern Aarau company. With continuing refinements, instruments steadily evolved into the modern theodolite used by surveyors today.\n\n=== Operation in surveying ===\n{{main|Triangulation (surveying)}}\n[[Image:theb1982.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]] technicians observing with a 0.2 [[arcsecond]] (\u2248 0.001 [[Milliradian|mrad]] or 1 \u00b5rad) resolution Wild T3 theodolite mounted on an observing stand. Photo was taken during an Arctic field party (c. 1950).]]\n\n[[Triangulation (surveying)|Triangulation]], as invented by [[Gemma Frisius]] around 1533, consists of making such direction plots of the surrounding landscape from two separate standpoints. The two graphing papers are superimposed, providing a scale model of the landscape, or rather the targets in it. The true scale can be obtained by measuring one distance both in the real terrain and in the graphical representation.\n\nModern triangulation as, e.g., practised by [[Willebrord Snell|Snellius]], is the same procedure executed by numerical means. Photogrammetric block adjustment of stereo pairs of aerial photographs is a modern, three-dimensional variant.\n\nIn the late 1780s, [[Jesse Ramsden]], a Yorkshireman from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], England who had developed the [[dividing engine]] for dividing angular scales accurately to within a second of arc (\u2248 0.0048 [[Milliradian|mrad]] or 4.8 \u00b5rad), was commissioned to build a new instrument for the British [[Ordnance Survey]]. The [[Ramsden theodolite]] was used over the next few years to map the whole of southern [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by triangulation.\n\nIn network measurement, the use of forced centering speeds up operations while maintaining the highest precision. The theodolite or the target can be rapidly removed from, or socketed into, the forced centering plate with sub-millimetre precision. Nowadays [[GPS]] antennas used for [[geodetic positioning]] use a similar mounting system. The height of the reference point of the theodolite\u2014or the target\u2014above the ground [[benchmark (surveying)|benchmark]] must be measured precisely.\n\n===Transit theodolite===\nThe term '''transit theodolite''', or '''transit''' for short, refers to a type of theodolite that was developed in the early 19th century. It was popular with American railroad engineers pushing west, and it replaced the [[railroad compass]], [[sextant]] and [[Octant (instrument)|octant]]. It features a vertical circle which is graduated through the full 360 degrees and a telescope that could \"flip over\" (\"transit the scope\").  By reversing the telescope and at the same time rotating the instrument through 180 degrees about the vertical axis, the instrument can be used in 'plate-left' or 'plate-right' modes ('plate' refers to the vertical protractor circle).  By measuring the same horizontal and vertical angles in these two modes and then averaging the results, centering and collimating errors in the instrument can be eliminated. Some transit instruments are capable of reading angles directly to thirty arc-seconds (\u2248 0.15 [[Milliradian|mrad]]). Modern theodolites are usually of the transit-theodolite design, but engraved plates have been replaced with glass plates designed to be read with [[light-emitting diodes]] and computer circuitry, greatly improving accuracy up to arc-second (\u2248 0.005 [[Milliradian|mrad]]) levels.\n\n{{anchor|Pibal}}\n== Use with weather balloons ==\nThere is a long history of theodolite use in measuring winds aloft, by using specially-manufactured theodolites to track the horizontal and vertical angles of special weather balloons called ''[[ceiling balloon]]s'' or ''pilot balloons'' (''pibal''). Early attempts at this were made in the opening years of the nineteenth century, but the instruments and procedures weren't fully developed until a hundred years later. This method was extensively used in World War II and thereafter, and was gradually replaced by radio and GPS measuring systems from the 1980s onward.\n\nThe pibal theodolite uses a prism to bend the optical path by 90 degrees so the operator's eye position does not change as the elevation is changed through a complete 180 degrees. The theodolite is typically mounted on a rugged steel stand, set up so it is level and pointed north, with the altitude and azimuth scales reading zero degrees. A balloon is released in front of the theodolite, and its position is precisely tracked, usually once a minute. The balloons are carefully constructed and filled, so their rate of ascent can be known fairly accurately in advance. Mathematical calculations on time, rate of ascent, azimuth and angular altitude can produce good estimates of wind speed and direction at various altitudes.<ref name=\"Brenner\">{{cite web |url=http://www.csulb.edu/~mbrenner/balloon.htm |title=Pilot Weather Balloon (Pibal) Optical Theodolites |last=Brenner |first=Martin |work=Martin Brenner's Pilot Balloon Resources |publisher=California State University, Long Beach |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2014-07-25 }}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Electronic}}\n== Modern electronic theodolites ==\n[[Image:Teodolit nikon 520.jpg|thumb|150px|A typical modern electronic theodolite: [[Nikon]] DTM-520]]\n\nIn modern electronic theodolites, the readout of the horizontal and vertical circles is usually done with a [[rotary encoder]]. These produce signals indicating the altitude and azimuth of the telescope which are fed to a microprocessor. [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] sensors have been added to the [[focal plane]] of the [[telescope]] allowing both auto-targeting and the automated measurement of residual target offset.

This occurs mainly in the underground mining industry and in tunnel engineering. For example, where a conduit must pass under a river, a vertical shaft on each side of the river might be connected by a horizontal tunnel. A gyrotheodolite can be operated at the surface and then again at the foot of the shafts to identify the directions needed to tunnel between the base of the two shafts. Unlike an artificial horizon or inertial navigation system, a gyrotheodolite cannot be relocated while it is operating. It must be restarted again at each site.\n\nThe gyrotheodolite comprises a normal theodolite with an attachment that contains a [[gyroscope]] mounted so as to sense rotation of the Earth and from that the alignment of the meridian. The meridian is the plane that contains both the axis of the Earth's rotation and the observer. The intersection of the meridian plane with the horizontal contains the true north-south geographic reference bearing required. The gyrotheodolite is usually referred to as being able to determine or find true north.\n\nA gyrotheodolite will function at the equator and in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The meridian is undefined at the geographic poles. A gyrotheodolite cannot be used at the poles where the Earth's axis is precisely perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the spinner, indeed it is not normally used within about 15 degrees of the pole because the east-west component of the Earth's rotation is insufficient to obtain reliable results. When available, astronomical star sights are able to give the meridian bearing to better than one hundred times the accuracy of the gyrotheodolite. Where this extra precision is not required, the gyrotheodolite is able to produce a result quickly without the need for night observations.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cinetheodolite]]\n* [[Dumpy level]]\n* [[Inclinometer]]\n* [[LIDAR]]\n* [[Macrometer]]\n* [[Plane table]]\n* [[Rankine's method]]\n* [[Survey camp]]\n* [[Temporary adjustments of theodolite]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n; Manufacturers\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Leica Geosystems]]\n* [[Sokkia]]\n* [[Topcon]]\n* [[Trimble (company)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscat-inline|Theodolites}}\n\n{{Measuring and alignment tools}}\n\n[[Category:Geodesy]]\n[[Category:Inclinometers]]\n[[Category:Optical devices]]\n[[Category:Surveying]]\n[[Category:Surveying instruments]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Surveying instrument}}\n{{anchor|Non-Transit|Transit|Seconds|Optical}}\n[[File:SovietTheodolite.jpg|thumb|A direct readout  theodolite, manufactured in the Soviet Union in 1958 and used for topographic surveying]]\n\nA '''theodolite''' {{IPAc-en|\u03b8|i\u02d0|\u02c8|\u0252|d|\u0259|l|a\u026a|t}} is a precision optical instrument for measuring [[angle]]s between designated visible points in the [[horizontal and vertical]] planes. The traditional use has been for [[surveying|land surveying]], but they are also used extensively for [[Construction|building and infrastructure construction]], and some specialized applications such as [[meteorology]] and [[rocket launch]]ing.<ref>{{citation |title=Double Theodolite Pibal Evaluation by Computer |first=Norman |last=Thyer |date=March 1962 |journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=66\u201368 |publisher=American Meteorological Society |doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1962)001<0066:DTPEBC>2.0.CO;2 |doi-access=free }}</ref> \n\nIt consists of a moveable [[telescope]] mounted so it can rotate around horizontal and vertical [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] and provide angular readouts. These indicate the orientation of the telescope, and are used to relate the first point sighted through the telescope to subsequent sightings of other points from the same theodolite position. These angles can be measured with great accuracy, typically to [[milliradian]] or [[Minute and second of arc|seconds of arc]]. From these readings a plan can be drawn, or objects can be positioned in accordance with an existing plan. The modern theodolite has evolved into what is known as a [[total station]] where angles and distances are measured electronically, and are read directly to computer memory.   \n\nIn a transit theodolite, the telescope is short enough to rotate through the [[zenith]], otherwise for non-transit instruments vertical (or altitude), rotation is restricted to a limited arc. \n\nThe [[optical level]] is sometimes mistaken for a theodolite, but it does not measure vertical angles, and is used only for [[levelling]] on a [[horizontal plane]].\n\n== Principles of operation ==\n[[File:theodolite vermeer.svg|thumb|The axes and circles of a theodolite]]\n[[File:Optical Theodolite.jpg|thumb|Diagram of an optical readout theodolite]]\n\n===Preparation for making sightings===\n{{main|Temporary adjustments of theodolites}}\nTemporary adjustments are a set of operations necessary in order to make a theodolite ready for taking observations at a station. These include its setting up, centering, leveling up and elimination of parallax, and are achieved in four steps:\n\n* Setting up: fixing the theodolite onto a tripod along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. \n* Centering: bringing the vertical axis of theodolite immediately over station mark using a centering plate also known as a [[tribrach (instrument)|tribrach]].\n* Levelling: leveling of the base of the instrument to make the vertical axis vertical usually with an in-built bubble-level.\n* Focusing: removing [[parallax]] error by proper focusing of objective and eye-piece. The eye-piece only requires adjustment once at a station. The objective will be re-focused for each subsequent sightings from this station because of the different distances to the target.\n\n===Sightings===\nSightings are taken by the surveyor, who adjusts the telescope's vertical and horizontal angular orientation so the [[cross-hairs]] align with the desired sighting point. Both angles are read either from exposed or internal scales and recorded. The next object is then sighted and recorded without moving the position of the instrument and tripod.\n\nThe earliest angular readouts were from open [[vernier scale]]s directly visible to the eye. Gradually these scales were enclosed for physical protection, and finally became an indirect optical readout, with convoluted light paths to bring them to a convenient place on the instrument for viewing. The modern digital theodolites have electronic displays.\n\n=== Errors in measurement ===\n; Index error: The angles in the vertical axis should read 90[[degree (angle)|\u00b0]] (100 [[grad (angle)|grad]]) when the sight axis is horizontal, or 270\u00b0 (300 grad) when the instrument is transited. Half of the difference between the two positions is called the index error. This can only be checked on transit instruments.\n; Horizontal axis error: The horizontal and vertical axes of a theodolite must be perpendicular; if not then a horizontal axis error exists. This can be tested by aligning the tubular spirit bubble parallel to a line between two footscrews and setting the bubble central. A horizontal axis error is present if the bubble runs off central when the tubular spirit bubble is reversed (turned through 180\u00b0). To adjust, the operator removes half the amount the bubble has run off using the adjusting screw, then re-level, test and refine the adjustment.\n; Collimation error: The optical axis of the telescope, must also be perpendicular to the horizontal axis. If not, then a collimation error exists.\n\nIndex error, horizontal-axis error (''trunnion-axis error'') and collimation error are regularly determined by [[calibration]] and are removed by mechanical adjustment. Their existence is taken into account in the choice of measurement procedure in order to eliminate their effect on the measurement results of the theodolite.\n\n{{anchor|Half|Simple|Plain}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Universaltheodolit.14Zoll.Pistor&Martins.Berlin.1851.jpg|thumb|upright|A theodolite of 1851, showing the open construction, and the altitude and azimuth scales which are read directly.]]\n\nThe term ''diopter'' was sometimes used in old texts as a synonym for theodolite.<ref>''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, 1971 - see entry for ''diopter''</ref> This derives from an older astronomical instrument called a [[dioptra]].\n\nPrior to the theodolite, instruments such as the [[Groma surveying|groma]], [[geometric square]] and various other graduated circles (see [[circumferentor]]) and semicircles (see [[graphometer]]) were used to obtain either vertical or horizontal angle measurements.

Some identify the early theodolite as an [[azimuth]] instrument only, while others specify it as an [[altazimuth mount|altazimuth]] instrument. In Digges's book, the name \"theodolite\" described an instrument for measuring horizontal angles only. He also described an instrument that measured both altitude and azimuth, which he called a ''topographicall instrument'' {{sic}}.<ref name=\"turnerEIM\">Turner, Gerard L'E., ''Elizabethan Instrument Makers: The Origins of the London Trade in Precision Instrument Making'', Oxford University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-19-856566-6}}</ref> Thus the name originally applied only to the azimuth instrument and only later became associated with the altazimuth instrument.

An [[alidade]] on the base was used to sight an object for horizontal angle measurement, and a second alidade was mounted on the vertical semicircle. Later instruments had a single alidade on the vertical semicircle and the entire semicircle was mounted so as to be used to indicate horizontal angles directly. Eventually, the simple, open-sight alidade was replaced with a sighting [[telescope]]. This was first done by [[Jonathan Sisson]] in 1725.<ref name=\"turner\"/>\n\nThe theodolite became a modern, accurate instrument in 1787, with the introduction of [[Jesse Ramsden]]'s famous [[Ramsden theodolite|great theodolite]], which he created using a very accurate [[dividing engine]] of his own design.<ref name=\"turner\">Turner, Gerard L'E. ''Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments'', Sotheby Publications, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85667-170-3}}</ref> The demand could not be met by foreign theodolites owing to their inadequate precision, hence all instruments meeting high precision requirements were made in England. Despite the many German instrument builders at the turn of the century, there were no usable German theodolites available. A transition was brought about by Breithaupt and the symbiosis of Utzschneider, Reichenbach and Fraunhofer.<ref>Ralf Kern: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit/Band 4: Perfektion von Optik und Mechanik. Cologne, 2010, pp. 349\u2013360.</ref> As technology progressed, in the 1840s, the vertical partial circle was replaced with a full circle, and both vertical and horizontal circles were finely graduated. This was the ''transit theodolite''. Theodolites were later adapted to a wider variety of mountings and uses. In the 1870s, an interesting waterborne version of the theodolite (using a pendulum device to counteract wave movement) was invented by [[Edward Samuel Ritchie]].<ref>American Academy of Arts and Sciences, ''Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'', Vol. XXIII, May 1895 \u2013 May 1896, Boston: University Press, John Wilson and Son (1896), pp. 359\u2013360</ref> It was used by the U.S. Navy to take the first precision surveys of American harbors on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.<ref>American Academy, pp. 359\u2013360</ref>\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, [[Heinrich Wild]] produced theodolites that became popular with surveyors. His Wild T2, T3, and A1 instruments were made for many years, and he would go on to develop the DK1, DKM1, DM2, DKM2, and DKM3 for Kern Aarau company. With continuing refinements, instruments steadily evolved into the modern theodolite used by surveyors today.\n\n=== Operation in surveying ===\n{{main|Triangulation (surveying)}}\n[[Image:theb1982.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]] technicians observing with a 0.2 [[arcsecond]] (\u2248 0.001 [[Milliradian|mrad]] or 1 \u00b5rad) resolution Wild T3 theodolite mounted on an observing stand. Photo was taken during an Arctic field party (c. 1950).]]\n\n[[Triangulation (surveying)|Triangulation]], as invented by [[Gemma Frisius]] around 1533, consists of making such direction plots of the surrounding landscape from two separate standpoints. The two graphing papers are superimposed, providing a scale model of the landscape, or rather the targets in it. The true scale can be obtained by measuring one distance both in the real terrain and in the graphical representation.\n\nModern triangulation as, e.g., practised by [[Willebrord Snell|Snellius]], is the same procedure executed by numerical means. Photogrammetric block adjustment of stereo pairs of aerial photographs is a modern, three-dimensional variant.\n\nIn the late 1780s, [[Jesse Ramsden]], a Yorkshireman from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], England who had developed the [[dividing engine]] for dividing angular scales accurately to within a second of arc (\u2248 0.0048 [[Milliradian|mrad]] or 4.8 \u00b5rad), was commissioned to build a new instrument for the British [[Ordnance Survey]]. The [[Ramsden theodolite]] was used over the next few years to map the whole of southern [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by triangulation.\n\nIn network measurement, the use of forced centering speeds up operations while maintaining the highest precision. The theodolite or the target can be rapidly removed from, or socketed into, the forced centering plate with sub-millimeter precision. Nowadays [[GPS]] antennas used for [[geodetic positioning]] use a similar mounting system. The height of the reference point of the theodolite\u2014or the target\u2014above the ground [[benchmark (surveying)|benchmark]] must be measured precisely.\n\n===Transit theodolite===\nThe term '''transit theodolite''', or '''transit''' for short, refers to a type of theodolite that was developed in the early 19th century. It was popular with American railroad engineers pushing west, and it replaced the [[railroad compass]], [[sextant]] and [[Octant (instrument)|octant]]. It features a vertical circle which is graduated through the full 360 degrees and a telescope that could \"flip over\" (\"transit the scope\").  By reversing the telescope and at the same time rotating the instrument through 180 degrees about the vertical axis, the instrument can be used in 'plate-left' or 'plate-right' modes ('plate' refers to the vertical protractor circle).  By measuring the same horizontal and vertical angles in these two modes and then averaging the results, centering and collimating errors in the instrument can be eliminated. Some transit instruments are capable of reading angles directly to thirty arc-seconds (\u2248 0.15 [[Milliradian|mrad]]). Modern theodolites are usually of the transit-theodolite design, but engraved plates have been replaced with glass plates designed to be read with [[light-emitting diodes]] and computer circuitry, greatly improving accuracy up to arc-second (\u2248 0.005 [[Milliradian|mrad]]) levels.\n\n{{anchor|Pibal}}\n== Use with weather balloons ==\nThere is a long history of theodolite use in measuring winds aloft, by using specially-manufactured theodolites to track the horizontal and vertical angles of special weather balloons called ''[[ceiling balloon]]s'' or ''pilot balloons'' (''pibal''). Early attempts at this were made in the opening years of the nineteenth century, but the instruments and procedures weren't fully developed until a hundred years later. This method was extensively used in World War II and thereafter, and was gradually replaced by radio and GPS measuring systems from the 1980s onward.\n\nThe pibal theodolite uses a prism to bend the optical path by 90 degrees so the operator's eye position does not change as the elevation is changed through a complete 180 degrees. The theodolite is typically mounted on a rugged steel stand, set up so it is level and pointed north, with the altitude and azimuth scales reading zero degrees. A balloon is released in front of the theodolite, and its position is precisely tracked, usually once a minute. The balloons are carefully constructed and filled, so their rate of ascent can be known fairly accurately in advance. Mathematical calculations on time, rate of ascent, azimuth and angular altitude can produce good estimates of wind speed and direction at various altitudes.<ref name=\"Brenner\">{{cite web |url=http://www.csulb.edu/~mbrenner/balloon.htm |title=Pilot Weather Balloon (Pibal) Optical Theodolites |last=Brenner |first=Martin |work=Martin Brenner's Pilot Balloon Resources |publisher=California State University, Long Beach |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2014-07-25 }}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Electronic}}\n== Modern electronic theodolites ==\n[[Image:Teodolit nikon 520.jpg|thumb|150px|A typical modern electronic theodolite: [[Nikon]] DTM-520]]\n\nIn modern electronic theodolites, the readout of the horizontal and vertical circles is usually done with a [[rotary encoder]]. These produce signals indicating the altitude and azimuth of the telescope which are fed to a microprocessor. [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] sensors have been added to the [[focal plane]] of the [[telescope]] allowing both auto-targeting and the automated measurement of residual target offset.

To this day, the unit's [[special designation]] is \"First Regiment of Dragoons\".<ref name=SUD />  While they were the First Regiment of Dragoons another unit designated the 1st Cavalry Regiment was formed in 1855 and in 1861 was re-designated as the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry Regiment]] (units were renumbered based on seniority and it was the fourth oldest mounted regiment in active service). The First Dragoons became the 1st Cavalry Regiment since they were the oldest mounted regiment.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|United States Cavalry}}\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), Continental forces patterned cavalry units after those of the opposing British forces, especially the well-supplied mounted [[dragoons]] of the [[British Army|King's Army (British Army)]]. The first cavalry unit formed by the [[Congress of the United States of America]] was a squadron of four troops (the Squadron of Light Dragoons) commanded by Major [[Michael Rudolph]] on 5 March 1792 (the troops would then be incorporated into the [[Legion of the United States]] (1792 to 1796)). In 1796 the dragoons were reduced to two companies, were dismounted units by 1800 and disbanded in 1802. In 1808 the [[Regiment of Light Dragoons (United States)|Regiment of Light Dragoons]] was formed and in 1812 another regiment ([[2nd Regiment of Light Dragoons (United States)|2nd Regiment of Light Dragoons]]) was raised.  Units of both regiments of dragoons served during the [[War of 1812]] in engagements at the [[Battle of the Mississinewa]]; the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]]; [[Fort Erie]] and the [[Siege of Fort Meigs]]. The 1st Regiment and 2nd Regiment were consolidated on 30 March 1814 into the single Regiment of Light Dragoons of eight troops, but this unit was dissolved in 1815 (the rationale was that cavalry forces were too expensive to maintain as part of a standing army, so Congress insisted on economy and a minimum standing Army).<ref>Stubbs, Mary Lee; Connor, Stanley.

The first order announcing appointments in the regiment was dated 5 March 1833, and gave the names of the colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, four captains and four lieutenants, stating that the organization of the regiment would be perfected by the selection of officers from the \"Battalion of Mounted Rangers.\"\nIn June 1834, the regiment filled its complement of officers, many of whom later became noted [[American Civil War|Civil War]] generals:\n* [[Colonel]]: [[Henry Dodge]] (transferred from the Battalion of Mounted Rangers)\n* [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]]: [[Stephen W.

Throughout the summer of 1835, all the companies of the regiment were kept in the field.\n[[File:The American Soldier, 1836.jpg|thumb|In the right foreground stands a subaltern of the First Regiment of Dragoons; in the left foreground is an ordnance sergeant-of which there was one on every Army post.]]\nThe regiment became the \"First Regiment of Dragoons\" when the Second Regiment of Dragoons was raised in 1836, however, the general disposition of the regiment remained unchanged. The various companies were employed in scouting among the Indians, especially along the Missouri frontier, with a portion of the regiment going to [[Nacogdoches, Texas]], to keep white trespassers from the Indian lands, and preserving peace between whites and Indians and among the Indians themselves; also in building wagon roads and bridges. During the winter, the companies returned to their respective stations \u2013 Forts Leavenworth, Gibson and Des Moines.\n\nColonel Dodge resigned on 4 July 1836, and was appointed [[Governor of Wisconsin]]. He was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Kearny. The regiment was not heavily engaged in the [[Second Seminole War|Florida war]], although it did take some minor casualties, including a lieutenant. In March 1837, a regimental order designated the color of the horses of each company as follows: A and K, black; B, F and H, sorrel; C, D, E and I, bay; and G, iron gray.\n\nIn October 1837, and again in March 1838, Colonel Kearny led elements of the regiment to quell [[Osage Nation|Osage]] Indians. In April 1839, the army created [[Fort Wayne (Indian Territory)|Fort Wayne]] in [[Indian Territory]], and Companies E, F, G and K, were stationed there for several years, with occasional forays into the field to chase hostile Indians. Kearny was promoted to brigadier general on 30 June 1846, and was succeeded by Colonel Mason.\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War===\n[[File:1st Regiment of Dragoons, Mexican-American War.png|thumb|right|250px|1st Regiment of Dragoons in [[Mexican\u2013American War]]]]\n\nGeneral Kearny was placed in command of the \"[[Army of the West (1846)]]\", which consisted of Companies B, C, G, I and K, 1st Dragoons, an artillery battalion, some separate infantry companies, two regiments of Missouri volunteer cavalry, the volunteer [[Mormon Battalion]], and the [[Jonathan D. Stevenson|1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]], which sailed from New York City to California by ship. All in all, the Army of the West consisted of about 3,700 men, which ventured west to New Mexico, some of whom did not reach California. This command was concentrated at [[Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site|Bent's Fort]] on the [[Arkansas River]], from which point it marched for [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa F\u00e9]] on 1 August 1846. The force occupied Santa F\u00e9 without much opposition, and, after leaving part of his force there, Kearny marched into California, arriving in December.\n\nOn the morning of 6 December 1846, Kearny's 150-man command met and defeated an equal number of California lancers at [[Battle of San Pasqual|San Pasqual]], about 40 miles from San Diego, under Major Andr\u00e9s Pico. The action was severe, with the 1st Dragoons losing 3 officers and 14 men killed, principally with lance thrusts. General Kearny himself received two wounds. His force finally reached San Diego on 12 December 1846.\n\nKearny, with a force consisting of Company C, 1st Dragoons, (60 dismounted men) under Captain Turner, sailors and marines with a battery of artillery and California volunteers, left San Diego for Los Angeles on 29 December. Kearny's troops routed Mexicans under Governor Flores at the [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel|crossing of the Rio San Gabriel]] on 8 January 1847, and on the [[Battle of La Mesa|plains of La Mesa]] on 9 January. With the capture of Los Angeles on the following day, all Mexican resistance to the American occupation of Southern California ceased.\n\nKearny had left Companies G and I at Albuquerque under Capt. J. H. K. Burgwin. When Col. [[Sterling Price]] (then in command at Santa F\u00e9) learned of the seizure and murder of the [[Governors of New Mexico Territory|New Mexico Governor]] [[Charles Bent]] and five others by the Mexicans (20 January), he moved out against them with a force of about 350 dismounted men and easily defeated them, on 24 January, at Canada. Captain Burgwin defeated another Mexican force shortly thereafter and rejoined Price's column for a series of further battles.\n\nDuring 1847, regimental headquarters were still at Leavenworth and Companies A and E were with [[Zachary Taylor]] in Mexico. Early in the year, Company B was reorganized at Jefferson Barracks before being sent to Santa Fe in June. On 26 June, while en route, the company was engaged by 300-400 [[Comanches]] at Grand Prairie, [[Arkansas]], losing five men killed and six wounded.  They were the first unit of the Regiment to seriously tangle with the frontier Indians.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\">{{cite web|url=http://macspics.homestead.com/History.html|title=History|website=macspics.homestead.com|accessdate=15 May 2017}}</ref>  Upon reaching Santa Fe, on 6 August with the $350,000 they had been escorting, Company B was retrained as a field artillery battery to support the regiment.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nCompanies D, F and K saw service on Scott's line in Mexico. Company F escorted General Scott from [[Veracruz]] to Mexico City and was present at the battles near that city. From 1 November to 20 December, it was engaged on escort duty between the city and Vera Cruz. In 1848, the three companies returned to the United States and were stationed at various points on the northwestern frontier. Companies B, G, and I served with General Sterling Price in February \u2013 March 1848 in his campaign down into the State of Chihuahua and participated in the attack on Santa Cruz de Rosales.\n\n===Further frontier duty===\nIn September 1848, the First Regiment of Dragoons rode out of Fort Kearny and returned to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and trained their new recruits.  On 11 May 1849, the regiment rode further west, and along with two companies of the [[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|6th Infantry Regiment]], guarded the treacherous [[Oregon Trail]] in the heart of [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] territory.  In October, an engagement on the [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]] near [[Linden, Nebraska]] and another engagement on the [[Platte River]] resulted in numerous Pawnee fatalities, and 5 Dragoon casualties.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nBrevet Brigadier General Mason, Colonel of the 1st Dragoons, died at Jefferson Barracks, on 25 July 1850, and was succeeded by Col. [[Thomas T. Fauntleroy (soldier)|Thomas T. Fauntleroy]], promoted from the Second Dragoons.  In 1853, the newly acquired [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] erupted in violence between the US and local Indian tribes.  After a reorganization period, elements of the 1st Regiment of Dragoons set out for [[New Mexico]] on 1 July 1854.  The year of 1854 was rough for the Dragoons; heavy casualties and a tenacious enemy took their toll.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nEarlier in the year, on 30 March 1854, Companies F and I were stationed at [[Cantonment Burgwin]] in New Mexico, and Lieutenant [[John Davidson (general)|J. W. Davidson]], with Company I and 16 men of Company F, disobeyed his orders and boldly attacked a [[Jicarilla Apache]] camp about 16 miles south of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] at [[Battle of Cieneguilla|Cieneguilla]]. The Indian camp was surprised and captured; while securing the camp, the troops were surprised by more Indians, who attacked the Dragoon horse-holders and took Davidson at such disadvantage that the command narrowly escaped annihilation. Fourteen men of Company I and eight of Company F were killed; Lieutenant Davidson and 14 men were wounded.  Regimental headquarters was transferred to [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], [[New Mexico Territory]], in July 1854, when the rest of the regiment arrived.  Throughout the following year, the companies in New Mexico were almost constantly on the move. Colonel Fauntleroy made three expeditions against the [[Ute people|Utes]] and [[Apaches]], and Companies I and K fought the Apaches.  On 17 January 1855, Companies B, G, and part of K were attacked at night by a band of Apaches while camped near the [[Penasco River]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  Despite being repulsed, the Indians adopted guerrilla tactics and skirmished the next day.  On the 19th, 12 troopers from B Company became separated and were ambushed by the Apache, suffering 3 killed including the Company Commander.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nMeantime, out West, Companies C and E took part in the [[Rogue River War]] in [[Oregon Territory]], in which, at the [[Battle of Hungry Hill]], the troops were compelled to retire with a loss of 26 killed and wounded, after fighting for a day and a half.\n\nIn the spring of 1855, two new regiments of cavalry, the First and Second Cavalry, were authorized in addition to the current two regiments of dragoons and the [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Regiment of Mounted Riflemen]] (formed in 1845). One of these new units named \"The First Cavalry Regiment\", under the command of Lt. Col. [[Edwin Vose Sumner]], the first regular American military unit to bear that name (in 1861 it was re-designated the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry Regiment]]). Sumner was previously with the First Dragoons.<ref>Chalfant, William Y., ''Cheyennes and Horse Soldiers'', University of Oklahoma Press, 1989.</ref>\n\nHeadquarters for the First Dragoons were moved to [[Fort Tejon]], California, in December 1856, with the various companies scattered throughout the West. For the next five years, the regiment engaged in a variety of Indian fights, seeing action at various times against the Navajos and Apaches in the Southwest and several tribes in the Northwest.  On 8 January 1859, B and K Companies fought an engagement with the [[Mohave people|Mojave]] in the [[Mohave Valley]] and another engagement against the [[Northern Paiute|Paiutes]] on 18\u201319 April 1860 near present-day [[Yermo, California]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\n===Civil War===\n\n====1861\u201362====\nColonel Fauntleroy resigned on 13 May 1861, and was succeeded by Col. [[Benjamin Lloyd Beall]]. With the outbreak of the Civil War and the War Department's wanting to re-designate all mounted regiments as cavalry and to renumber them in order of seniority., the First Dragoons became the \"First Regiment of Cavalry\" by an Act of Congress on 3 August 1861 (the existing First Cavalry Regiment (formed in 1855) was the fourth oldest mounted regiment in terms of active service, so it was re-designated the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry Regiment]]). During November and December, the regiment, except Companies D and G, which were still stationed in New Mexico Territory, was transferred by steamship from the [[Pacific Coast]] through [[Panama]] and then to Washington, D.C., arriving by the end of January 1862. Colonel Beall retired 1 February, and was succeeded by Col. [[George A.H. Blake]]. The regiment was attached to the 2d Brigade, Cavalry Reserve, [[Army of the Potomac]].\n\nIn the meantime, the two companies left in Confederate Arizona had abandoned and destroyed Forts Breckinridge and Buchanan and retreated to [[Fort Craig]]. Company D was engaged in a skirmish with [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]] near Fort Craig, on 19 February, and the two companies took part in the [[Battle of Valverde]] on 21 February. Company D took part in the engagements at [[Battle of Glorieta Pass|Pigeon's Ranch]], 30 March; [[Battle of Albuquerque|Albuquerque]], 25 April; and [[Battle of Peralta|Peralta]], 27 April.\n\nThe bulk of the 1st U.S. Cavalry, meanwhile, fought in the [[Peninsula Campaign]] in [[Virginia]]. At [[Battle of Williamsburg|Williamsburg]], on 4 May, a squadron under Capt. Benjamin F. \"Grimes\" Davis charged and repulsed Confederate cavalry, capturing a flag but losing 13 men. At [[Battle of Gaines Mill|Gaines' Mill]], on 27 June, the regiment lost 26 more men. The regiment participated in fighting at [[Battle of Malvern Hill|Malvern Hill]], [[Battle of Kelly's Ford|Kelly's Ford]], and during Stoneman's Raid in April and May.\n\n====1863====\nAt the [[Battle of Brandy Station|battle of Beverly Ford]] in June 1863, Davis was killed while in command of the 8th New York Cavalry. At [[Battle of Upperville|Upperville]], the 1st U.S. Cavalry met the Jeff Davis Legion and the 1st and 2d North Carolina regiments in a mounted charge. The regiment lost 53 men (most to saber cuts). At [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], its loss was 16 men. Several more men were lost in a series of skirmishes during the Confederate retreat to Virginia.\n\nIn June 1863, the two companies left in New Mexico were broken up. The officers and noncommissioned officers were transferred to [[Carlisle Barracks]], where the companies were reorganized, joining the regiment at Camp Buford, Maryland, in October 1863. After a period of rest and re-equipping near Washington, D.C., the 1st Cavalry rejoined the Army of the Potomac and was engaged at Manassas Junction and at Catlett's Station, on 5 November; Culpeper, on 8 November; Stephensburg, on 26 November, and Mine River. The regiment was employed during the winter doing picket duty along the [[Rapidan River]].\n\n====1864====\n[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14576127288).jpg|thumb|1st Cavalry at [[Brandy Station]], February 1864]]\nIn February, the 1st U.S. Cavalry engaged in a series of fights along the Rapidan line, and then accompanied Brig. Gen. [[George Armstrong Custer]] in a raid on [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. On [[Philip H. Sheridan|General Sheridan]]'s taking command of the [[Cavalry Corps (ACW)|Cavalry Corps]], the 1st Cavalry, now commanded by Capt. N. B. Sweitzer, was attached to [[Wesley Merritt|Merritt]]'s Reserve or Regular Brigade, Torbert's Division, and in the preparation for the [[Overland Campaign]], the regiment was employed in picketing the Rapidan, taking part in the battles of Todd's Tavern, on 7 May, and [[Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse|Spotsylvania Court House]], on 8 May.\n\nThe regiment subsequently accompanied Sheridan on his daring raid around [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], fighting at Beaver Dam Station, on 10 May; [[Yellow Tavern]], on 11 May: [[Battle of Meadow Bridge|Meadow Bridge]] and Mechanicsville, on 12 May; Tunstall's Station, on 14 May; Hawe's Shop, on 28 May; and Old Church, on 30 May.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], on 1 June, the regiment saw severe fighting, losing several men and officers. The 1st Cavalry then accompanied General Sheridan on his Trevilian raid, and lost 35 men in the [[Battle of Trevilian Station]], on 11 and 12 June. The regiment was engaged in daily skirmishing during the return march to White House Landing, and was engaged there on 17 June, at the [[Chickahominy River]] on 18 June, and at the battle of Darby's Farm, on 28 June. The 1st Cavalry captured an enemy flag at the battle of Deep Bottom, on 28 July, where the Regular Brigade, fighting on foot, routed a brigade of Confederate cavalry.\n\nOn 31 July, the 1st Division marched to City Point, embarked on ships the next day, and was transported to Washington, D.C. to assist in repelling the threatened attack of [[Jubal A. Early|General Early]]. On 5 August, it moved towards [[Harpers Ferry]], having been ordered to the [[Shenandoah Valley]] to rejoin Sheridan. On 10 August, the Reserve Brigade routed Confederates near Winchester. The regiment was then engaged in almost daily skirmishing, and took part in all the important valley battles except [[Battle of Fisher's Hill|Fisher's Hill]]. From 16 August through 20 August, the 1st Cavalry was employed, together with the whole of the 1st Division, in the destruction of all wheat and forage, and the seizure of all horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs accessible in the valley.\n\nThe 1st Cavalry took part in the charge of the Reserve Brigade at the [[Battle of Opequon]], on 19 September, and, in conjunction with the 2nd Cavalry, captured two stands of colors and some 200 prisoners. Its casualties were 37 killed, wounded and missing. On 28 September, in an action at Waynesboro, it suffered 18 additional casualties.\n\nThe 1st Cavalry played an important part in the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]], 19 October. After the surprise and defeat of [[Horatio G. Wright]] in the morning, the divisions of Merritt and Custer came up as reinforcements. Two squadrons of the 1st Cavalry formed perpendicular across the Valley Pike and dismounted behind stone walls, the third squadron being held in reserve. This position was held with great difficulty, the advanced squadron being subjected to an enfilading fire.\n\nThe regiment then returned to Middletown and, during the fall and winter, engaged in numerous skirmishes and took part in Merritt's raid through the [[Loudoun Valley]] and Torbert's raid on Gordonsville. In December, the regiment was assigned to duty at the Cavalry Corps headquarters in Winchester.\n\n====1865====\nOn 27 February, Sheridan commenced his last expedition through the Shenandoah Valley, wanting to destroy the [[Virginia Central Railroad]] and the [[James River Canal]], and capture [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]]. The 1st Cavalry took part in the [[Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia|Battle of Waynesboro]], on 2 March, where the remnant of Early's army was captured. It was then engaged in many skirmishes during a march from Charlottesville to White House Landing, while destroying locks and the embankment of the James River Canal, railroads and Confederate supplies. It arrived at White House Landing on 17 March, taking part in a sharp engagement that day.\n\nThe 1st Cavalry was then present in all the major battles of the Cavalry Corps until the close of the war. On 30 March, it was in the engagement on White Oak Road; on 31 March, at Dinwiddie Court House; on 1 April, at [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]]. There, the regiment charged an entrenched enemy position, carried it and seized 200 prisoners. It also fought on 2 April in the engagement near the Southside Railroad; on 6 April, at the [[Battle of Sayler's Creek]]; and on 9 April, at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Courthouse]], the surrender of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]].\n\nThe regiment then returned to [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], where it remained in camp until 24 April, when it marched with the Cavalry Corps towards [[North Carolina]] for the proposed junction with [[William T. Sherman|Sherman]]. On the surrender of [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army, the Cavalry Corps returned to Petersburg and the regiment, escorting General Sheridan, left for Washington on 8 May, arriving on 16 May and taking part in the [[Grand Review of the Armies]].\n\n===Return to frontier===\nLater that month, the regiment was ordered to [[Louisiana]], arriving at New Orleans on 31 May and remaining there until 29 December, when it embarked for California via the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. It was stationed at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] on 22 January, with Companies A, G and K going on 5 February to [[Drum Barracks]], where Companies C, D and E, followed them on 17 February, Company L going to Sacramento. In June, regimental headquarters went to [[Vancouver Barracks|Fort Vancouver]] and the several companies were distributed through Oregon, Washington Territory, Idaho, California, Nevada and Arizona, no two being at the same station.\n\n====Snake War====\n{{Main|Snake War}}\n[[File:US Army Cavalry Sergeant 1866 (Bis).jpg|thumb|130px|1866 picture of model showing correct uniform of a Company \"A\" 1st US Cavalry SGT wearing Hardee hat]]\nFrom 1866 to 1871, various companies from the 1st Cavalry Regiment were involved in numerous skirmishes involving Indians during the [[American Indian Wars]] throughout the west. From 1866 to 1868, they operated in [[Oregon]], [[Idaho Territory]], [[Nevada]], and [[California]] fighting the [[Snake War]].  Although not defined by one large battle, this series of guerrilla skirmishes and frontier clashes across the high-desert [[sagebrush]] plains would be the deadliest Indian War in the West, with 1,762 fatalities.<ref>[[Snake War]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} These skirmishes included an expedition from [[Fort Bidwell]], California, during 22\u201329 October 1866, when Company A killed 14 Indians, three women, four children, and captured an entire camp. Later that year, LTC [[George Crook]] led an expedition of one company of the 1st Cavalry to pursue the Indians in their winter quarters.  On 26 December 1866, at the [[Battle of Owyhee River]] in [[Malheur County, Oregon]] Crook's men caught the [[Northern Paiute people|Paiutes]] asleep in their camp.<ref name=Michno211>Michno 2003, p.211</ref>  However, after the first shots were fired, [[Chief Howluck]] determined to stay and fight.  The native warriors taunted the soldiers, who returned a deadly accurate fire on the warriors.  Quickly into the fighting almost every mounted warrior was shot down.  The rest sought refuge behind rocks, remaining there until mid-day when they retreated.<ref name=Michno2007>Michno 2007, p.194</ref>  Continuing his pursuit Crook again encountered the [[Chief Paulina]]'s Paiute village at [[Steens Mountain|Steen's Mountain]] (named after an early officer of the 1st Dragoons).  As Crook ordered the charge his horse bolted and carried him through the native village.<ref name=Michno130>Michno 2003, p.194</ref>  Nevertheless, his men followed.  Despite several close calls for Crook personally, his troopers' fire was accurate and inflicted heavy casualties.  A month later Crook's men engaged in one final skirmish before Crook ended the expedition due to bad weather.\n\nOn the nights of 7\u20138 February 1867, 25 men of Company B on a patrol were attacked by hostile Indians near [[Vicksburg Mines]] in Nevada.  On 5 April 1868, Company F killed 32 Indians and captured two near [[Malheur River]], Oregon.  Following the Indians south into California, Crook's 1st Cavalry troopers, along with infantrymen from the [[23rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|23rd Infantry Regiment]] and 15 Warm Springs and [[Shoshone]] scouts encountered a large band of them in an entrenched position. The Native American warriors had made a fortress out of [[lava rock]]s in the [[Infernal Caverns]] of northern California near the town of [[Likely, California|Likely]].<ref name=Michno211>Michno 2003, p.211</ref>  From there they were able to pour a steady fire upon the soldiers commanded by Lt. Col. [[George Crook]].  Crook's men attacked on the second day.  Despite heavy casualties they managed to scale the cliffs and take the fortifications.  Colonel Crook reportedly shot down Chief Sieto himself.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.farwestern.com/crookscanyon/page08.htm |title=Place of Many Soldiers p. 8 |access-date=28 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303050654/http://www.farwestern.com/crookscanyon/page08.htm |archive-date=3 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Fighting continued into the night as the Native warriors withdrew deeper into the caverns. Crook commented \"I never wanted dynamite so bad as I did when we first took the fort and heard the diabolical and defiant yells from down in the rocks\". On the third day the Natives had fled the caverns.\n\n====1866\u20131871====\nThey also fought in the [[Apache Wars]] in [[Arizona Territory]] from 1866 to 1872. On 29 January 1867, Company M encountered a band of 90 warriors at Stein's Mountain in [[New Mexico Territory]]; 60 Indians were killed and 27 captured. From 26 to 31 May 1868, eight men of Company M killed 34 Indians. At [[Fort McDowell, Arizona|Fort McDowell]] in Arizona on 9\u201311 December 1869, 20 men from Company E killed an entire band of 11 [[Yavapai people|Mojave Apaches]].\n\nOn 15 December 1870, Colonel Blake was retired from active service on his own application, and Colonel [[Alvan C. Gillem]] of the 11th Infantry was transferred to the First Cavalry in his stead.\n\n====Modoc War====\n{{Main|Modoc War}}\nThe [[Modoc people|Modoc Indians]] were a small tribe living in northern California near [[Tule Lake]] and [[Lost River (California)|Lost River]]. Through the intercession of interested civilians, orders were issued for the Modocs removal to the Klamath Indian Reservation. They went on the reservation, but, on account of ill treatment, left it, and the War Department was then directed to enforce the orders. The Indians at once commenced hostilities and one of the most protracted and obstinate Indian wars of later years followed.\n\nCompany B left [[Fort Klamath]], on 28 November 1872, for the purpose of arresting \"Captain Jack\" and the leaders of his band of Modocs, and at daylight on 29 November surprised the Indians in their camp near the Lost River. The Indians refused to surrender and an engagement followed in which eight Indians were killed and many wounded, and the camp, squaws, and property were captured. The company lost two men killed and six wounded, two of them mortally. The company then went into camp at Crowley's Ranch on Lost River opposite the Indian camp.\n\nCompany G from Fort Bidwell took station on 13 December at Land's Ranch, Tule Lake, near the Indian stronghold. The Indians attacked this camp on 21 December, and were repulsed, but not until two men and five horses had been killed. Company B now joined Company G and the two companies marched against the Indians on 16 January 1873 in conjunction with General Wheaton's column, with which Company F and a detachment of Company H were also serving at this time. The Indians attacked Companies B and G the same afternoon, but were repulsed, the companies losing three men wounded. The general engagement took place on 17 January, and lasted from 7.30 A.M. to 9.30 P.M., when the troops retired, going finally into camp at Applegate's Ranch near [[Clear Lake Reservoir|Clear Lake]]. The regiment lost two men killed and two officers, \u2013 Captain Perry and Lieutenant Kyle, \u2013 and eight men wounded, one mortally.\n\nThe Indians attacked a wagon train on 22 January, driving away the escort. However, Captain [[Reuben F. Bernard]], 1st Cavalry, came up with reinforcements and the Indians were repulsed, losing one killed and many wounded. Company K from Fort Halleck, Nev., joined the battalion on 18 February. The battalion now consisted of Companies B, F, G and K, under Captain Biddle, who was soon succeeded by Captain Bernard. Colonel Gillem, 1st Cavalry was commanding the expedition, and Company H joined the column on 10 February.\n\nDuring the night of 14 April, the companies of the 1st Cavalry moved with the rest of the command to invest the Modoc stronghold, and in the [[Second Battle of the Stronghold]], 15\u201317 April, drove the Indians out of their position and into the rocks and mountains. The 1st Cavalry lost two men killed and two wounded. On 26 April, Companies B and F went to the scene of the \"Thomas massacre\" and brought off a number of the wounded and dead. The same companies were attacked by Indians on 10 May, at Sorass Lake, California, but repulsed them with the loss of one warrior killed and two wounded. The command lost one killed and six wounded, two of them mortally. On 17 May, Companies B, G and K, with a battery (serving as cavalry) of the 4th Artillery, all under Major John Green, came upon a band of Modocs, which they drove five miles, killing one and capturing several squaws and children. The troops followed the trail and on 22 May, 70 Indians \u2013 men, women and children \u2013 surrendered. \"Boston Charlie\" was captured on 29 May, and on 31 May \"Sconchin\", \"Scarfaced Charlie\", and 27 other Indians surrendered.\n\nCompanies F and H were sent from Applegate's Ranch on 31 May to follow up on those Modocs who had eluded Green's command, finding them on 1 June, when the whole party surrendered. With the capture of \"Captain Jack\", the Modoc war ended, and by the end of June the companies that had been engaged in it had returned to their proper stations.\n\nThe companies left in Arizona were moved north, and by the end of October 1873, headquarters with Companies A and D were at Benicia Barracks; B at Fort Klamath; C at Camp McDermitt, Nev.; E at Fort Lapwai, Idaho Territory -, F, L and M at Fort Walla Walla, Wyoming Territory; G at Camp Bidwell, California.; H and K at [[Camp Harney]], Oregon.; and I at Camp Halleck, Nevada.\n\nColonel Gillem died at his residence in [[Nashville]], Tenn., 2 December 1875, and was succeeded by Colonel [[Cuvier Grover]], promoted from the 3rd Cavalry.\n\n====1877 Nez Perce War====\n{{Main|Nez Perce War}}\nOn 15 June 1877, Companies F and H, under Captain Perry, were ordered to proceed to Camas Prairie to the assistance of the settlers of Mount Idaho, I. T., who were threatened by the Nez Perc\u00e9 Indians under Chief Joseph. Learning that the Indians were crossing Salmon River and could be taken at a disadvantage, the march was given that direction and Chief Joseph's camp was found and taken by surprise, but the Indians quickly rallied and repulsed the troops with severe loss, Lieutenant E. W. Theller, 21st Infantry (attached), and 33 men being killed and two wounded.\n\nAll the companies of the regiment, except M at [[Fort Colville]] and A at Camp Harney watching the Piutes, were now ordered into the field against the Nez Perc\u00e9s. Companies E and L joined General Howard's command on 21 June; and on 1 July they surprised and attacked the camp of \"Looking Glass\" on the Clearwater, I. T. The village was entirely destroyed, several Indians killed and about 1,000 ponies captured. On 2 July, the same command attempted to form a junction with Company F, which was on its way from Lapwai. On 3 July, the Indians ambushed the advanced guard, consisting of Lieutenant S. M. Rains, ten men of the battalion and two civilian scouts, killing them all, and were then found to be in such force and so strongly posted that it was considered imprudent to attack them. The junction with Company F was effected, however, on 4 July, and the same afternoon the Indians attacked, the fight lasting until sunset. The battalion (E, F and L) joined General Howard at Grangerville, on 8 July. Company H had joined on 2 July, and the battalion was commanded by Captain David Perry.\n\nOn 11 July, General Howard crossed the Clearwater with his whole command and moved down that stream with Company H in advance. The Indian camp was discovered and at once attacked, the fight lasting two days and ending with the retreat of the Indians. Company B joined in time to take part in the fight on 12 July. The regiment lost three men killed and four wounded. The battalion made a reconnaissance on 18 July of the Lo-Lo trail, and the Indian scouts accompanying it were ambushed and met with considerable loss. One Nez Perc\u00e9 was killed.\n\nMajor Sanford's battalion, consisting of Companies C, D, I and K, joined General Howard on the Clearwater, on 28 July, and the expedition across the Lo-Lo trail began on 30 July. Companies B, C, I and K, under Major Sanford, accompanied it, and Companies D, E, G and L, with other troops under Major Green, constituted the \"Reserve Column\", which remained at Camas Prairie until 5 August, when it moved near to Mount Idaho, and established a permanent camp called Camp Howard. Companies F and H were stationed at [[Fort Lapwai]].\n\nIn the Indian attack at Camas Creek on 20 August, Companies B and L were engaged, losing one man killed and one wounded. At Judith Basin, the battalion was detached from General Howard's command and directed to return, and all the companies had reached their stations by the end of November. Company K and a detachment of C, attached to General Sturgis' command, took part in the engagement with the Nez Perc\u00e9s at Canyon Creek, Montana, on 13 September 1877.\n\n====1878====\n{{Main|Bannock War}}\nAt the outbreak of the [[Bannock War]] in May 1878, Company G was the first body of troops to reach the scene of hostilities, and Captain Bernard reported that the Indians numbered from 300 to 500. They were moving towards [[Steens Mountain]] (named after [[Enoch Steen]], a former member of the regiment). The whole of the First Cavalry was at once ordered into the field and Colonel Grover sent to Fort Boise to take charge of operations there. Companies D, I and K, were with him. Companies F and L joined Company G on the Owyhee, 17 June, and the three companies reached Camp Harney on 21 June, where they were joined by Company A. These four companies were designated the \"Left Column\" by General Howard.\n\nOn the morning of 23 June, the Left Column struck the main camp of the hostiles on Silver Creek, and drove the Indians out of it and on to a cutbank, made by the creek, which had been prepared for defense. The action lasted into the night and in the morning it was found that the Indians had gone. Many Indians were killed and the camp was destroyed. The battalion lost two killed and three wounded. Company K joined the battalion on 27 June, and on 28 June the cavalry cut loose from the foot troops and pushed forward on the trail of the Indians. The fertile John Day Valley was saved in great part by this vigorous pursuit, and on 5 July General Howard overtook the command, arriving with it at Pilot Rock on 7 July. Here, it was joined by Companies E and H. The Indian camp was located and at sunrise on 8 July Captain Bernard moved his battalion to the attack.\n\nAbout 300 Indians occupied the crest of the high and steep hills near Birch Creek, and were at once attacked. Captain Bernard fought his cavalry on foot without separating the men from the horses. All the companies, except A with the pack train, were deployed and used in the engagement, and the Indians were driven from three successive positions and finally four or five miles further into the mountains. Four men were wounded, one mortally, and probably 20 horses were killed. The enemy's loss is unknown; their women, children and best horses were sent off, seemingly towards the Grande Ronde, before the action began.\n\n[[Charles Erskine Scott Wood|Lieutenant C. E. S. Wood, A. D. C.]], wrote: \"The entire fight was closely watched by the general commanding, who desires to express his opinion that no troops ever behaved better or in a more soldierly manner than did the officers and men engaged in this encounter.\" The command camped for the night among the rough ca\u00f1ons adjacent to the battle-field.\n\nCaptain Bernard was then ordered to take his command, except Company K, to Fort Walla Walla to refit. Company K was sent to join the infantry column and with it moved to the Umatilla Agency, near which the hostiles were reported to be. Here the Indians attacked on 13 July. In the ensuing fight, Company K held the right of the line and took part in the final charge by which the Indians were driven off the field and for three miles into the hills. At the request of the Indian Agent, the command moved back to the agency that night, but two days later seven dead Indians were counted upon the battle-field.\n\nCompanies A, E, F, G, H and I, now under Lieutenant-Colonel J. W. Forsyth, 1st Cavalry, left Fort Walla Walla on 13 July \u2013 the day of the fight at Umatilla Agency \u2013 in search of the Indians, who were found to be travelling in the direction of John Day River. On 20 July, Forsyth's scouts were ambushed, which caused a halt and deployment of the command, but when the line moved forward the Indians had gone. On 22 July, the battalion reached 11 Burnt Meadows, where it was joined by Companies D and I, under Major Sanford, and on 27 July it went into camp at Malheur Agency to await supplies. The hostiles had now split up into many small parties, which were followed up and nearly all ultimately captured.\n\nDuring the months of September and October, the companies were sent to their permanent stations, and the return for 30 November shows Companies A and E at Camp Harney, Oregon; B, D, F, K and M, at Fort Walla Walla, W. T.; C at Camp Bidwell, California; G at Fort Boise, L T.; H at Fort Colville, W. T.; I at Camp Halleck, Nevada, and L at Fort Klamath, Oregon.\n\n====1881====\nIn 1881, Companies C, G, I and M were sent to Arizona, and on 2 October, Company G, with other troops, was in action near Cedar Springs against Apaches. The hostiles fought with great boldness and desperation and the fight lasted until 9 P. M., when the Indians escaped. Company G had two men wounded and 12 horses killed. On 4 October, Companies G and I had a running fight near South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains, in which the hostiles were followed into Sonora, Mexico.\n\nIn October 1881, the \"companies\" began to be designated \"troops\" on the Regimental Return. Troop G returned to Fort McDermott on 9 November; Troop I to Camp Halleck on 27 December; Troop M to the Presidio of San Francisco on 20 January 1882; and Troop C to Fort Bidwell on 16 April.\n\n====1884\u201387====\nIn June 1884, the regiment was transferred to the Department of Dakota, after a tour of nearly 30 years on the Pacific coast, during the greater part of which time its stations were remote from civilization and its duties of a most arduous and thankless character. On 5 June 1885, Colonel Grover died at Atlantic City, New Jersey and was succeeded by Colonel N. A. M. Dudley, promoted from the 9th Cavalry.\n\nDuring this time, the headquarters and troops D, G, I, K and M, went to Fort Custer; A, C and F went to Fort Maginnis; E to Fort Ellis; H and L to Fort Assinniboine; and B to Fort Keogh.\n\nFrom 1886 to 1918, Company M, 1st Cavalry was stationed at [[Fort Yellowstone]].\n\nConflict with the \"Crows\" came in the fall of 1887, and on the morning of 4 November, Colonel Dudley left Fort Custer with Troops A, B, D, E, G and K, and Company B, 3d Infantry, with a section of Hotchkiss guns, to arrest \"Sword Bearer\" and the Indians who had fired into the agency buildings on the night of 30 September.\n\nOn 5 November, a demand was made upon the Indians for the surrender of these men, and they were given an hour and a half to comply with the demand. At the end of that time, the battalion of the 1st Cavalry, with Moylan's troop of the 7th Cavalry on the right, moved out in front of camp. At the same time, a 'great commotion was observed in the Indian camp, and \"Sword Bearer\" and another chief dashed out leading from 120 to 150 warriors equipped for battle. The Indians charged, but were repulsed and fell back into the timber alongside the river, where they had dug many rifle pits from which they now kept up a constant fire. This fire was returned, and \"Sword Bearer\" was seen to fall, whereupon all fighting quickly ceased. All the Indians whose surrender had been demanded and who had not been killed were at once brought in and delivered to the Department Commander, who sent them to Fort Snelling. The cavalry battalion returned to Fort Custer on 13 November.\n\n====1889\u20131892====\nColonel Dudley was retired from active service on 20 August 1889, and was succeeded by Colonel [[J. S. Brisbin]], promoted from the 9th Cavalry. On 31 December, Headquarters and Troops B, D, E, G and M, were at Fort Custer; A and L at [[Fort Maginnis]]; C, F and H at [[Fort Assinniboine]]; I at [[Fort Leavenworth]]; and K at Camp Sheridan, [[Wyoming]].\n\nIn April 1890, the [[Cheyennes]] assumed a threatening attitude and their agent called on the commanding officer of Fort Custer for protection, who sent Major Carrol with Troops B, D and M to the [[Tongue River Agency]], where they established [[Camp Crook (Montana)|Camp Crook]]. In September, a white boy was murdered by \"Head Chief\" and \"Young Mule\", and every attempt to arrest the murderers failed. On 11 April, the Indians sent word that they would attack the agency and on 12 April made their appearance on a hill commanding the agency buildings, where they opened fire upon them. They were soon dislodged and killed. The regiment took part in the operations against the hostile Sioux in the winter of 1890\u20131891, but was not brought into actual contact with them.\n\nIn December 1890, word having been received that a troop of cavalry was surrounded by hostile Indians at or near Cave Hills, Montana, Troop A made one of the most remarkable marches on record in going to its relief. It marched 186 miles, 95 of which were made in 25 hours, and 170 in 53\u00bd hours. The report that caused such tremendous exertion proved to be without foundation.\n\nOn 22 April 1891, Colonel Brisbin was transferred to the [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry]] with Colonel [[Abraham K. Arnold]] who had been the lieutenant colonel and now became the colonel of the First. In 1892, the regiment was transferred to the Department of [[Arizona]], relieving the 10th Cavalry. Headquarters and Troops C, E, F, H and K, going to [[Fort Grant]], Arizona.; B and I to [[Fort Bayard Historic District|Fort Bayard]], [[New Mexico]]; D to [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation|Fort Apache]], Arizona; and G to [[San Carlos, Arizona|San Carlos]]. Troop A was at [[Fort Myer]], [[Virginia]], and was not moved.\n\n====Medals of Honor====\n\nOwing to the vast extent of country guarded by the regiment, its service for many years following was very arduous. Scouting for Indians and escort duty of various kinds were incessant. During this period, 30 soldiers and officers serving with the regiment earned the [[Medal of Honor]]. Eighteen of these awards were for a single engagement against Apaches in the [[Chiricahua Mountains]] of Arizona, and another six were for actions in [[George Crook]]'s \"winter campaign\" of 1872\u201373. The recipients were:<ref name=\"moh\"/>\n\n=====Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona, 20 October 1869=====\n* Sergeant [[Frederick Jarvis]], Company G\n* Trumpeter [[Bartholomew T.

After the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}} exploded in [[Havana Harbor]], the fires of war brewed and the 1st Cavalry was moved to Chickamauga Park, [[Tennessee]] on 24 April 1898.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  The 1st Cavalry and the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]] were formed into a cavalry [[brigade]] and shipped out to Cuba from [[Tampa, Florida]].  However, due to the limited space aboard the ''SS Leona'', the troopers were forced to leave their horses behind.  They fought in the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]] on 24 June, and at the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] from 1\u20133 July.  During the [[Siege of Santiago]], the 1st Cavalry Regiment earned its 61st battle honor.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  The 1st Cavalry remained in [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]] until 8 August, and returned to the US where they were garrisoned at Fort Riley, Kansas, then later at [[Fort Robinson]], Nebraska.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\n===The Philippines and border duty===\nOn 19 June 1899, the 1st Cavalry left Ft Robinson for [[Fort D.A. Russell (Wyoming)|Fort D.A. Russell]], [[Wyoming]] and began thorough training for new recruits after a brief reorganization period.  When the [[Boxer Rebellion]] began in China in August 1899, the US Army garrison in the [[Philippines]] was moved to [[Peking]] to relieve the surrounded legations there, and the 1st Cavalry was sent to the Philippines on 7 August, their horses following four days later.  Arriving at [[Batangas]], [[Luzon]] on 20 September, they moved to [[Santo Tomas, Batangas|Santo Tomas]] just south of [[Manila]].  They busied themselves with scouting missions, escorting supplies, and patrolling the countryside and villages for guerrilla fighters.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nIn October 1901, a group of insurgents stole some native supplies, so 20 troopers pursued them, reclaimed the goods, and burned the village they were found in, and on 22 October, Troop B captured 5 guerrillas on [[Mount Makiling]].  From 18 November-1 December, 35 troopers from the 1st Cavalry took part in the [[Mount San Cristobal]] Expedition, which destroyed an enemy supply cache.  On 15 March 1902, Troop B killed 5 insurgents on Mount Makiling, and killed 4 more on 19 March.  On 16 April, the leader of these guerrillas, General Malvar, surrendered, and hostilities ceased.  The 1st Cavalry Regiment was sent back home, and arrived at their new post, [[Fort Clark, Texas]], on 1 October 1903, where they remained for three years.  After the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], 1st Cavalry troopers moved there to assist, and Troop B remained in San Francisco until 9 June 1907 before returning to [[Texas]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nThe 1st Cavalry Regiment returned to the Philippines in 1908 and garrisoned [[Fort Stotsenburg]] for two years.  This deployment was much quieter than their last one, and the regiment returned home on 12 February 1910.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  A, B, D, and K Troops were stationed at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] and later joined the rest of their regiment at the [[Presidio of Monterey]] until 1 August 1914.  Moving to [[Southern California]], the 1st Cavalry garrisoned [[San Ysidro]] in response to growing tensions south of the border in [[Mexico]].  On 24 August 1915, the regiment moved to [[Calexico, California]] to strengthen the border and defend against raids by the ''bandito'', [[Pancho Villa]].  They remained guarding the border while [[General Pershing]] launched the [[Pancho Villa Expedition|Punitive Expedition]] and were still there when the US entered World War I.  The 1st Cavalry did not participate in the First World War, but it remained guarding the border until 19 January 1923, when they went to [[Fort D. A. Russell (Texas)|Fort D. A. Russell, Texas]].  This was their last posting as horse cavalry, and during a parade on 14 December 1932, the troopers dismounted and passed in review, saluting their horses as they left them to become a mechanized unit.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  Moving to [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]], the 1st Cavalry Regiment became the first mechanized unit in the United States Army, and was brigaded with the [[13th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|13th Cavalry Regiment]] to form the [[7th Cavalry Brigade (United States)|7th Cavalry Brigade (Mecz)]].  In the summer of 1939, 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mecz) took part in the [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]] Maneuvers and helped develop the Army's first tactics for mechanized warfare.  In the summer of 1940, the [[Louisiana]] Maneuvers convinced the Army of the need to form an armored force and the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] was founded on 15 July 1940.  The 1st Cavalry Regiment was redesignated the 1st Armored Regiment that same day, and was assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>.  It wouldn't be long until America's fledgling armored force would be tested in battle.\n\n===World War II===\nThe 1st Armored Division was one of the first American units to sail across the [[Atlantic]] to do battle with the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. Leaving from [[Fort Dix, New Jersey]] on 11 April 1942, the Old Ironsides patch set foot on European soil in [[Northern Ireland]] on 16 May 1942. Here, they trained with a new intensity as they prepared to go into battle for the first time. \n\n====Algeria-French Morocco====\nOnce the United States entered World War II on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], the Army began rigorous training and reorganization to prepare for combat against the [[Axis powers|Axis]].  The 1st Armored Regiment, part of the 1st Armored Division, was one of the first American units to engage in combat in World War II in the [[North African Campaign]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  On 8 November 1942, the 1st Armored Regiment landed at [[St Leu]], [[French Morocco]] and captured [[Tafaraoui Airfield]] later in the day after overrunning a battery of [[Vichy French]] guns.  The next day, the regiment fought well against a counterattack by French tanks and managed to destroy 14 French [[Renault R35|R35]] tanks, for the loss of 1 US tank and 1 US KIA.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nAfter defeating the Vichy French forces in [[Operation Torch]], the 1st Armored Regiment began its fight against the [[Wehrmacht]] in [[Tunisia]].  In one engagement against a combined German-[[Royal Italian Army during World War II|Italian]] force, \"A\" Company lost six tanks but managed to draw the enemy's fire, allowing \"B\" Company to fire into the enemy's vulnerable rear, knocking out six [[Panzer IV]]s and one [[Panzer III]] before the rest retreated.  Two miles to the north, Axis infantry was observed dismounting from vehicles and the remaining tanks of Companies A and B advanced on them and destroyed the enemy force.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nIn November 1943, the 1st Armored Regiment, as a part of the 1st Armored Division, moved to Italy and fought in the [[Naples-Foggia Campaign]], the Allied drive to [[Monte Cassino]].  The winter months in Italy were mired in mud and stalemate.  The rains and stiff German resistance on river and mountain-top defensive lines halted Allied progress.  In late January 1944, the 1st Armored Regiment landed in [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]] as part of the Allied operation to outflank the German [[Winter Line]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  The armored forces broke through the German encirclement on 24 May 1944 after heavy fighting.  After participating in the liberation of Rome on 5 June 1944, the 1st Armored Division was pulled off the frontline and reorganized under a new table of organization.  The 1st Armored Regiment was redesignated as the 1st Tank Battalion.  The division was placed back onto the line and the 1st Tank Battalion steadily [[Trasimene Line|advanced north]] and crossed the [[Arno]] on 1 September.  This river crossing was followed by bloody stalemate in the [[Gothic Line|North Apennines]], where the rough and cold terrain hindered tank operations.  Their final action in the Second World War was the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Po Valley Campaign]], where they fought from 21\u201326 April 1945.  The 1st Tank Battalion was deactivated after [[VE Day]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nWhen the [[Korean War]] began, the Army began re-mobilizing.  1st Battalion, 1st Armored Regiment was reactivated as the 1st Tank Battalion at [[Fort Hood]], Texas and 2nd Battalion, 1st Armored Regiment was activated as the 100th Tank Battalion and trained until they were combined together on 15 February 1957 at [[Fort Polk]], [[Louisiana]] to reform the 1st Cavalry Regiment.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\n===Vietnam===\nIn August 1967, the [[1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment]] (1-1 Cavalry) was detached from the 1st Armored Division and sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] attached to [[US Army Pacific]]. On deployment to Vietnam in 1967, the squadron consisted of three armored cavalry troops and one air cavalry troop, D Troop, which was not deployed until July 1968. 'D' Troop, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment was shipped to Vietnam with its aircraft to join its parent unit, which was already in Vietnam attached to the [[23rd Infantry Division (United States)|Americal Division]] at Chu Lai. En route, D Troop's orders were changed, temporarily attaching it to the [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne Division]]. The troop disembarked at Da Nang on 21 July 1968 and flew directly to [[Camp Eagle (Vietnam)|Camp Eagle]]. The Troop then remained on combat duty in I Corps for the next four years and used the call sign Sabre. 1-1 Cavalry served in [[Chu Lai Base Area|Chu Lai]], [[\u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng]], [[Tam K\u1ef3 Base Camp|Tam K\u1ef3]], and Thach Khe. On 15 April 1966 Troop E, 1st Cavalry was activated as the brigade reconnaissance troop of the 11th Infantry Brigade at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. Troop E arrived in Vietnam on 19 December 1967 and participated in extensive ground combat in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i and Quang Tin provinces through eleven campaigns, receiving the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry for service in 1969\u20131970 with the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 23rd Infantry Division (Americal). Troop E was inactivated in Vietnam on 13 November 1971. They departed Vietnam on 10 May 1972.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nOn 1 July 1963, the 2nd Squadron, 1st Cavalry was relieved of their duties to the [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]], United States Army, Europe and reassigned to the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] at [[Fort Hood]], Texas. On 8 August 1967, the unit left Fort Hood for Vietnam where they were attached to the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]], headquartered in [[Pleiku]]. During their service in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]], troopers saw action in Pleiku, [[\u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4 Base Camp|\u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4]], [[Suoi Doi]], [[Kon Tum]], [[Camp Radcliff|An Kh\u00ea]] and many other nameless stretches of road and jungle.  In May 1969, the squadron was transferred to Task Force South in [[Firebase Betty|Phan Thi\u1ebft]] and was attached to the 1st Field Force, Vietnam. Now operating in the rice paddies and rubber plantations of Vietnam, the Blackhawks further distinguished themselves in actions around Phan Thi\u1ebft, [[Song Mao Base Camp|Song Mao]], [[Phan Rang]] and their environs.  2-1 Cavalry departed Vietnam in October 1970, leaving [[Cam Ranh Bay]] for reassignment to the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas.\n\n7th Squadron (Air), 1st Cavalry was a self-contained Vietnam-era air cavalry squadron, made up of five troops. Headquarters and Headquarters Troop (callsign Kingbird/Blackhawk), Alpha Troop (callsign Apache), Bravo Troop (callsign Dutch Master), Charlie Troop (callsign Sand Piper/Comanche) and Delta Troop (Powder Valley/Dragoon). D Troop (the squadron's armored cavalry troop) participated in successful night ambushes, escorted convoys, search and clear missions and other ground operations until the U.S. 9th Div was withdrawn from Vietnam. After that the offensive mission of D Troop was taken away and they were used to train the South Vietnamese [[South Vietnamese Regional Forces|Regional Force]] infantry units of the 44th Special Zone (STZ) in air assault missions, which were quite successful. The 44th STZ protected a region along the Cambodian border to the north.  Troops A, B and C were [[Air Cavalry]] units. When the U.S. 9th Division was returned to the US, their Air Cavalry Troop, D/3 3-5th Cav, was added to the 7-1st Cav, bringing the number of Air Cavalry Troops to 4. This was the largest Air Cav Squadron in Vietnam. Equipped to perform scout, insertion, interdiction and attack missions, the troops supported the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) [[21st Division (South Vietnam)|21st]], [[9th Division (South Vietnam)|9th]], [[7th Division (South Vietnam)|7th Division]]s and the 44 STZ. The Squadron was initially attached to the 12th Aviation Group, then from 3 June 1968, to the 164th Aviation Group. In 1970, when President Nixon approved a US/ARVN [[Cambodian Campaign|assault into Cambodia]], the squadron, with 4 Air Cav troops abreast formed the advanced guard for the 3 ARVN Divisions. After several weeks in Cambodia, all the units returned to the Delta where enemy activities dropped to an all-time low. In April 1972, 7-1 Cavalry was assigned to the 194th Armored Brigade, [[Fort Knox]], Kentucky. In 1976, the unit was inactivated and used to form air cavalry troops in the reactivated 5th, 7th and 24th Infantry Divisions.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nAll US combat troops were withdrawn by 30 November 1972.\n\n===Arctic Cavalry===\nOn 31 December 1972 Troop E was reactivated as a separate air cavalry reconnaissance troop and assigned to the 172nd Infantry Brigade at Fort Wainwright, Alaska.

As the \"Eyes & Ears\" of the 1st Armored Division based out of its Garrison at O'Brien Barracks in Schwabach, FRG, the Line Troops (A - \"Alpha\", B \"Bravo\", C \"Charlie\") rotated on a 30 to 45 day cycle through 1-1 Cavlary's Border Camp Pitman in Weiden, FRG between Field Training Exercises (FTX), Unit Gunnery Exercises and augmentations of other Border Cavalry Camps along the Inner German Cold War Iron Curtain Border with East Germany and Czechoslovakia. During this border surveillance mission period the line Troops were often typically deployed from their O'Brien Barracks Garrison for around 9 to 10 Months each year participating in various FTX's, REFORGER's (Return of Forces to Germany), Unit Gunnery Exercises, Border Tours and Augmentations.\n\nIn 1988 the Squadron moved Garrison to Katterbach, FRG and the unit eventually gained additional aviation elements to help support its mission. As part of the move and conversion from H Series Cavalry configuration to J Series Cavalry configuration, C Troop was dropped as a ground Troop and became one of the new Aviation Troops (C & D) added.\n\n===Gulf War and Balkans===\nWhen [[Sadaam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]] invaded [[Kuwait]] precipitating the [[Gulf War]], the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment moved to [[Saudi Arabia]] from their bases in Germany and into the line by 8 January 1991.  The 1st Armored Division was in a wedge for the advance forward, and 1-1 Cavalry was at the \"sharp end\" of the wedge.  On 24 February, the 1st Cavalry led the way across the border and covered 244 kilometers in the enemy's rear during 89 hours of sustained combat operations.  1-1 Cavalry helped destroy 4 Iraqi divisions along the way, 3 of which were members of the vaunted [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]].  The squadron sustained no fatalities and a limited number of wounded, and only lost two [[M3A2 Bradley]] fighting vehicles.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\n1-1 Cavalry was involved in [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] beginning 20 December 1995 in the [[Balkans]]. A Troop 1-1 Cavalry was First Unit across the Sava River during the UN peacekeeping mission in [[Bosnia]].

To this day, the unit's [[special designation]] is \"First Regiment of Dragoons\".<ref name=SUD />  While they were the First Regiment of Dragoons another unit designated the 1st Cavalry Regiment was formed in 1855 and in 1861 was re-designated as the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry Regiment]] (units were renumbered based on seniority and it was the fourth oldest mounted regiment in active service). The First Dragoons became the 1st Cavalry Regiment since they were the oldest mounted regiment.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|United States Cavalry}}\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), Continental forces patterned cavalry units after those of the opposing British forces, especially the well-supplied mounted [[dragoons]] of the [[British Army|King's Army (British Army)]]. The first cavalry unit formed by the [[Congress of the United States of America]] was a squadron of four troops (the Squadron of Light Dragoons) commanded by Major [[Michael Rudolph]] on 5 March 1792 (the troops would then be incorporated into the [[Legion of the United States]] (1792 to 1796)). In 1796 the dragoons were reduced to two companies, were dismounted units by 1800 and disbanded in 1802. In 1808 the [[Regiment of Light Dragoons (United States)|Regiment of Light Dragoons]] was formed and in 1812 another regiment ([[2nd Regiment of Light Dragoons (United States)|2nd Regiment of Light Dragoons]]) was raised.  Units of both regiments of dragoons served during the [[War of 1812]] in engagements at the [[Battle of the Mississinewa]]; the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]]; [[Fort Erie]] and the [[Siege of Fort Meigs]]. The 1st Regiment and 2nd Regiment were consolidated on 30 March 1814 into the single Regiment of Light Dragoons of eight troops, but this unit was dissolved in 1815 (the rationale was that cavalry forces were too expensive to maintain as part of a standing army, so Congress insisted on economy and a minimum standing Army).<ref>Stubbs, Mary Lee; Connor, Stanley.

Then, the regiment was sent on the [[First Dragoon Expedition]], or the Pawnee Expedition, during which, although it ended in September, a full one-fourth of the officers and men died of fever.<ref name=\"1st Cavalry\">{{cite book |last1=Wainwright|first1=Robert Powell Page|editor1-first=Theophilus Francis|editor1-last=Rodenbough|editor2-first=William L.|editor2-last=Haskin|title=The Army of the United States|trans-title=Historical Sketches of Staff and Line with Portraits of Generals-in-Chief|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/R&H/R&H-FM.htm|accessdate=12 February 2011|year=1896|publisher=Maynard, Merrill, & Co.|location=New York|oclc=1635675|page=153|chapter=The First Regiment of Cavalry|chapterurl=http://www.history.army.mil/books/R&H/R&H-1CV.htm}}</ref> For the winter, Headquarters with Companies A, C, D and G, were sent to [[Fort Leavenworth]]; Companies B, H and I, Lieutenant Colonel Kearny, commanding, into the Indian country on the right bank of the [[Mississippi River]], near the mouth of the [[Des Moines River]]; and Companies E, F and K, Major Mason commanding, to [[Fort Gibson]]. Throughout the summer of 1835, all the companies of the regiment were kept in the field.\n[[File:The American Soldier, 1836.jpg|thumb|In the right foreground stands a subaltern of the First Regiment of Dragoons; in the left foreground is an ordnance sergeant-of which there was one on every Army post.]]\nThe regiment became the \"First Regiment of Dragoons\" when the Second Regiment of Dragoons was raised in 1836, however, the general disposition of the regiment remained unchanged. The various companies were employed in scouting among the Indians, especially along the Missouri frontier, with a portion of the regiment going to [[Nacogdoches, Texas]], to keep white trespassers from the Indian lands, and preserving peace between whites and Indians and among the Indians themselves; also in building wagon roads and bridges. During the winter, the companies returned to their respective stations \u2013 Forts Leavenworth, Gibson and Des Moines.\n\nColonel Dodge resigned on 4 July 1836, and was appointed [[Governor of Wisconsin]]. He was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Kearny. The regiment was not heavily engaged in the [[Second Seminole War|Florida war]], although it did take some minor casualties, including a lieutenant. In March 1837, a regimental order designated the color of the horses of each company as follows: A and K, black; B, F and H, sorrel; C, D, E and I, bay; and G, iron gray.\n\nIn October 1837, and again in March 1838, Colonel Kearny led elements of the regiment to quell [[Osage Nation|Osage]] Indians. In April 1839, the army created [[Fort Wayne (Indian Territory)|Fort Wayne]] in [[Indian Territory]], and Companies E, F, G and K, were stationed there for several years, with occasional forays into the field to chase hostile Indians. Kearny was promoted to brigadier general on 30 June 1846, and was succeeded by Colonel Mason.\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War===\n[[File:1st Regiment of Dragoons, Mexican-American War.png|thumb|right|250px|1st Regiment of Dragoons in [[Mexican\u2013American War]]]]\n\nGeneral Kearny was placed in command of the \"[[Army of the West (1846)]]\", which consisted of Companies B, C, G, I and K, 1st Dragoons, an artillery battalion, some separate infantry companies, two regiments of Missouri volunteer cavalry, the volunteer [[Mormon Battalion]], and the [[Jonathan D. Stevenson|1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]], which sailed from New York City to California by ship. All in all, the Army of the West consisted of about 3,700 men, which ventured west to New Mexico, some of whom did not reach California. This command was concentrated at [[Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site|Bent's Fort]] on the [[Arkansas River]], from which point it marched for [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa F\u00e9]] on 1 August 1846. The force occupied Santa F\u00e9 without much opposition, and, after leaving part of his force there, Kearny marched into California, arriving in December.\n\nOn the morning of 6 December 1846, Kearny's 150-man command met and defeated an equal number of California lancers at [[Battle of San Pasqual|San Pasqual]], about 40 miles from San Diego, under Major Andr\u00e9s Pico. The action was severe, with the 1st Dragoons losing 3 officers and 14 men killed, principally with lance thrusts. General Kearny himself received two wounds. His force finally reached San Diego on 12 December 1846.\n\nKearny, with a force consisting of Company C, 1st Dragoons, (60 dismounted men) under Captain Turner, sailors and marines with a battery of artillery and California volunteers, left San Diego for Los Angeles on 29 December. Kearny's troops routed Mexicans under Governor Flores at the [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel|crossing of the Rio San Gabriel]] on 8 January 1847, and on the [[Battle of La Mesa|plains of La Mesa]] on 9 January. With the capture of Los Angeles on the following day, all Mexican resistance to the American occupation of Southern California ceased.\n\nKearny had left Companies G and I at Albuquerque under Capt. J. H. K. Burgwin. When Col. [[Sterling Price]] (then in command at Santa F\u00e9) learned of the seizure and murder of the [[Governors of New Mexico Territory|New Mexico Governor]] [[Charles Bent]] and five others by the Mexicans (20 January), he moved out against them with a force of about 350 dismounted men and easily defeated them, on 24 January, at Canada. Captain Burgwin defeated another Mexican force shortly thereafter and rejoined Price's column for a series of further battles.\n\nDuring 1847, regimental headquarters were still at Leavenworth and Companies A and E were with [[Zachary Taylor]] in Mexico. Early in the year, Company B was reorganized at Jefferson Barracks before being sent to Santa Fe in June. On 26 June, while en route, the company was engaged by 300-400 [[Comanches]] at Grand Prairie, [[Arkansas]], losing five men killed and six wounded.  They were the first unit of the Regiment to seriously tangle with the frontier Indians.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\">{{cite web|url=http://macspics.homestead.com/History.html|title=History|website=macspics.homestead.com|accessdate=15 May 2017}}</ref>  Upon reaching Santa Fe, on 6 August with the $350,000 they had been escorting, Company B was retrained as a field artillery battery to support the regiment.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nCompanies D, F and K saw service on Scott's line in Mexico. Company F escorted General Scott from [[Veracruz]] to Mexico City and was present at the battles near that city. From 1 November to 20 December, it was engaged on escort duty between the city and Vera Cruz. In 1848, the three companies returned to the United States and were stationed at various points on the northwestern frontier. Companies B, G, and I served with General Sterling Price in February \u2013 March 1848 in his campaign down into the State of Chihuahua and participated in the attack on Santa Cruz de Rosales.\n\n===Further frontier duty===\nIn September 1848, the First Regiment of Dragoons rode out of Fort Kearny and returned to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and trained their new recruits.  On 11 May 1849, the regiment rode further west, and along with two companies of the [[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|6th Infantry Regiment]], guarded the treacherous [[Oregon Trail]] in the heart of [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] territory.  In October, an engagement on the [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]] near [[Linden, Nebraska]] and another engagement on the [[Platte River]] resulted in numerous Pawnee fatalities, and 5 Dragoon casualties.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nBrevet Brigadier General Mason, Colonel of the 1st Dragoons, died at Jefferson Barracks, on 25 July 1850, and was succeeded by Col. [[Thomas T. Fauntleroy (soldier)|Thomas T. Fauntleroy]], promoted from the Second Dragoons.  In 1853, the newly acquired [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] erupted in violence between the US and local Indian tribes.  After a reorganization period, elements of the 1st Regiment of Dragoons set out for [[New Mexico]] on 1 July 1854.  The year of 1854 was rough for the Dragoons; heavy casualties and a tenacious enemy took their toll.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nEarlier in the year, on 30 March 1854, Companies F and I were stationed at [[Cantonment Burgwin]] in New Mexico, and Lieutenant [[John Davidson (general)|J. W. Davidson]], with Company I and 16 men of Company F, disobeyed his orders and boldly attacked a [[Jicarilla Apache]] camp about 16 miles south of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] at [[Battle of Cieneguilla|Cieneguilla]]. The Indian camp was surprised and captured; while securing the camp, the troops were surprised by more Indians, who attacked the Dragoon horse-holders and took Davidson at such disadvantage that the command narrowly escaped annihilation. Fourteen men of Company I and eight of Company F were killed; Lieutenant Davidson and 14 men were wounded.  Regimental headquarters was transferred to [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], [[New Mexico Territory]], in July 1854, when the rest of the regiment arrived.  Throughout the following year, the companies in New Mexico were almost constantly on the move. Colonel Fauntleroy made three expeditions against the [[Ute people|Utes]] and [[Apaches]], and Companies I and K fought the Apaches.  On 17 January 1855, Companies B, G, and part of K were attacked at night by a band of Apaches while camped near the [[Penasco River]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  Despite being repulsed, the Indians adopted guerrilla tactics and skirmished the next day.  On the 19th, 12 troopers from B Company became separated and were ambushed by the Apache, suffering 3 killed including the Company Commander.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nMeantime, out West, Companies C and E took part in the [[Rogue River War]] in [[Oregon Territory]], in which, at the [[Battle of Hungry Hill]], the troops were compelled to retire with a loss of 26 killed and wounded, after fighting for a day and a half.\n\nIn the spring of 1855, two new regiments of cavalry, the First and Second Cavalry, were authorized in addition to the current two regiments of dragoons and the [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Regiment of Mounted Riflemen]] (formed in 1845). One of these new units named \"The First Cavalry Regiment\", under the command of Lt. Col. [[Edwin Vose Sumner]], the first regular American military unit to bear that name (in 1861 it was re-designated the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry Regiment]]). Sumner was previously with the First Dragoons.<ref>Chalfant, William Y., ''Cheyennes and Horse Soldiers'', University of Oklahoma Press, 1989.</ref>\n\nHeadquarters for the First Dragoons were moved to [[Fort Tejon]], California, in December 1856, with the various companies scattered throughout the West. For the next five years, the regiment engaged in a variety of Indian fights, seeing action at various times against the Navajos and Apaches in the Southwest and several tribes in the Northwest.  On 8 January 1859, B and K Companies fought an engagement with the [[Mohave people|Mojave]] in the [[Mohave Valley]] and another engagement against the [[Northern Paiute|Paiutes]] on 18\u201319 April 1860 near present-day [[Yermo, California]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\n===Civil War===\n\n====1861\u201362====\nColonel Fauntleroy resigned on 13 May 1861, and was succeeded by Col. [[Benjamin Lloyd Beall]]. With the outbreak of the Civil War and the War Department's wanting to re-designate all mounted regiments as cavalry and to renumber them in order of seniority., the First Dragoons became the \"First Regiment of Cavalry\" by an Act of Congress on 3 August 1861 (the existing First Cavalry Regiment (formed in 1855) was the fourth oldest mounted regiment in terms of active service, so it was re-designated the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry Regiment]]). During November and December, the regiment, except Companies D and G, which were still stationed in New Mexico Territory, was transferred by steamship from the [[Pacific Coast]] through [[Panama]] and then to Washington, D.C., arriving by the end of January 1862. Colonel Beall retired 1 February, and was succeeded by Col. [[George A.H. Blake]]. The regiment was attached to the 2d Brigade, Cavalry Reserve, [[Army of the Potomac]].\n\nIn the meantime, the two companies left in Confederate Arizona had abandoned and destroyed Forts Breckinridge and Buchanan and retreated to [[Fort Craig]]. Company D was engaged in a skirmish with [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]] near Fort Craig, on 19 February, and the two companies took part in the [[Battle of Valverde]] on 21 February. Company D took part in the engagements at [[Battle of Glorieta Pass|Pigeon's Ranch]], 30 March; [[Battle of Albuquerque|Albuquerque]], 25 April; and [[Battle of Peralta|Peralta]], 27 April.\n\nThe bulk of the 1st U.S. Cavalry, meanwhile, fought in the [[Peninsula Campaign]] in [[Virginia]]. At [[Battle of Williamsburg|Williamsburg]], on 4 May, a squadron under Capt. Benjamin F. \"Grimes\" Davis charged and repulsed Confederate cavalry, capturing a flag but losing 13 men. At [[Battle of Gaines Mill|Gaines' Mill]], on 27 June, the regiment lost 26 more men. The regiment participated in fighting at [[Battle of Malvern Hill|Malvern Hill]], [[Battle of Kelly's Ford|Kelly's Ford]], and during Stoneman's Raid in April and May.\n\n====1863====\nAt the [[Battle of Brandy Station|battle of Beverly Ford]] in June 1863, Davis was killed while in command of the 8th New York Cavalry. At [[Battle of Upperville|Upperville]], the 1st U.S. Cavalry met the Jeff Davis Legion and the 1st and 2d North Carolina regiments in a mounted charge. The regiment lost 53 men (most to saber cuts). At [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], its loss was 16 men. Several more men were lost in a series of skirmishes during the Confederate retreat to Virginia.\n\nIn June 1863, the two companies left in New Mexico were broken up. The officers and noncommissioned officers were transferred to [[Carlisle Barracks]], where the companies were reorganized, joining the regiment at Camp Buford, Maryland, in October 1863. After a period of rest and re-equipping near Washington, D.C., the 1st Cavalry rejoined the Army of the Potomac and was engaged at Manassas Junction and at Catlett's Station, on 5 November; Culpeper, on 8 November; Stephensburg, on 26 November, and Mine River. The regiment was employed during the winter doing picket duty along the [[Rapidan River]].\n\n====1864====\n[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14576127288).jpg|thumb|1st Cavalry at [[Brandy Station]], February 1864]]\nIn February, the 1st U.S. Cavalry engaged in a series of fights along the Rapidan line, and then accompanied Brig. Gen. [[George Armstrong Custer]] in a raid on [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. On [[Philip H. Sheridan|General Sheridan]]'s taking command of the [[Cavalry Corps (ACW)|Cavalry Corps]], the 1st Cavalry, now commanded by Capt. N. B. Sweitzer, was attached to [[Wesley Merritt|Merritt]]'s Reserve or Regular Brigade, Torbert's Division, and in the preparation for the [[Overland Campaign]], the regiment was employed in picketing the Rapidan, taking part in the battles of Todd's Tavern, on 7 May, and [[Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse|Spotsylvania Court House]], on 8 May.\n\nThe regiment subsequently accompanied Sheridan on his daring raid around [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], fighting at Beaver Dam Station, on 10 May; [[Yellow Tavern]], on 11 May: [[Battle of Meadow Bridge|Meadow Bridge]] and Mechanicsville, on 12 May; Tunstall's Station, on 14 May; Hawe's Shop, on 28 May; and Old Church, on 30 May.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], on 1 June, the regiment saw severe fighting, losing several men and officers. The 1st Cavalry then accompanied General Sheridan on his Trevilian raid, and lost 35 men in the [[Battle of Trevilian Station]], on 11 and 12 June. The regiment was engaged in daily skirmishing during the return march to White House Landing, and was engaged there on 17 June, at the [[Chickahominy River]] on 18 June, and at the battle of Darby's Farm, on 28 June. The 1st Cavalry captured an enemy flag at the battle of Deep Bottom, on 28 July, where the Regular Brigade, fighting on foot, routed a brigade of Confederate cavalry.\n\nOn 31 July, the 1st Division marched to City Point, embarked on ships the next day, and was transported to Washington, D.C. to assist in repelling the threatened attack of [[Jubal A. Early|General Early]]. On 5 August, it moved towards [[Harpers Ferry]], having been ordered to the [[Shenandoah Valley]] to rejoin Sheridan. On 10 August, the Reserve Brigade routed Confederates near Winchester. The regiment was then engaged in almost daily skirmishing, and took part in all the important valley battles except [[Battle of Fisher's Hill|Fisher's Hill]]. From 16 August through 20 August, the 1st Cavalry was employed, together with the whole of the 1st Division, in the destruction of all wheat and forage, and the seizure of all horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs accessible in the valley.\n\nThe 1st Cavalry took part in the charge of the Reserve Brigade at the [[Battle of Opequon]], on 19 September, and, in conjunction with the 2nd Cavalry, captured two stands of colors and some 200 prisoners. Its casualties were 37 killed, wounded and missing. On 28 September, in an action at Waynesboro, it suffered 18 additional casualties.\n\nThe 1st Cavalry played an important part in the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]], 19 October. After the surprise and defeat of [[Horatio G. Wright]] in the morning, the divisions of Merritt and Custer came up as reinforcements. Two squadrons of the 1st Cavalry formed perpendicular across the Valley Pike and dismounted behind stone walls, the third squadron being held in reserve. This position was held with great difficulty, the advanced squadron being subjected to an enfilading fire.\n\nThe regiment then returned to Middletown and, during the fall and winter, engaged in numerous skirmishes and took part in Merritt's raid through the [[Loudoun Valley]] and Torbert's raid on Gordonsville. In December, the regiment was assigned to duty at the Cavalry Corps headquarters in Winchester.\n\n====1865====\nOn 27 February, Sheridan commenced his last expedition through the Shenandoah Valley, wanting to destroy the [[Virginia Central Railroad]] and the [[James River Canal]], and capture [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]]. The 1st Cavalry took part in the [[Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia|Battle of Waynesboro]], on 2 March, where the remnant of Early's army was captured. It was then engaged in many skirmishes during a march from Charlottesville to White House Landing, while destroying locks and the embankment of the James River Canal, railroads and Confederate supplies. It arrived at White House Landing on 17 March, taking part in a sharp engagement that day.\n\nThe 1st Cavalry was then present in all the major battles of the Cavalry Corps until the close of the war. On 30 March, it was in the engagement on White Oak Road; on 31 March, at Dinwiddie Court House; on 1 April, at [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]]. There, the regiment charged an entrenched enemy position, carried it and seized 200 prisoners. It also fought on 2 April in the engagement near the Southside Railroad; on 6 April, at the [[Battle of Sayler's Creek]]; and on 9 April, at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Courthouse]], the surrender of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]].\n\nThe regiment then returned to [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], where it remained in camp until 24 April, when it marched with the Cavalry Corps towards [[North Carolina]] for the proposed junction with [[William T. Sherman|Sherman]]. On the surrender of [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army, the Cavalry Corps returned to Petersburg and the regiment, escorting General Sheridan, left for Washington on 8 May, arriving on 16 May and taking part in the [[Grand Review of the Armies]].\n\n===Return to frontier===\nLater that month, the regiment was ordered to [[Louisiana]], arriving at New Orleans on 31 May and remaining there until 29 December, when it embarked for California via the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. It was stationed at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] on 22 January, with Companies A, G and K going on 5 February to [[Drum Barracks]], where Companies C, D and E, followed them on 17 February, Company L going to Sacramento. In June, regimental headquarters went to [[Vancouver Barracks|Fort Vancouver]] and the several companies were distributed through Oregon, Washington Territory, Idaho, California, Nevada and Arizona, no two being at the same station.\n\n====Snake War====\n{{Main|Snake War}}\n[[File:US Army Cavalry Sergeant 1866 (Bis).jpg|thumb|130px|1866 picture of model showing correct uniform of a Company \"A\" 1st US Cavalry SGT wearing Hardee hat]]\nFrom 1866 to 1871, various companies from the 1st Cavalry Regiment were involved in numerous skirmishes involving Indians during the [[American Indian Wars]] throughout the west. From 1866 to 1868, they operated in [[Oregon]], [[Idaho Territory]], [[Nevada]], and [[California]] fighting the [[Snake War]].  Although not defined by one large battle, this series of guerrilla skirmishes and frontier clashes across the high-desert [[sagebrush]] plains would be the deadliest Indian War in the West, with 1,762 fatalities.<ref>[[Snake War]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} These skirmishes included an expedition from [[Fort Bidwell]], California, during 22\u201329 October 1866, when Company A killed 14 Indians, three women, four children, and captured an entire camp. Later that year, LTC [[George Crook]] led an expedition of one company of the 1st Cavalry to pursue the Indians in their winter quarters.  On 26 December 1866, at the [[Battle of Owyhee River]] in [[Malheur County, Oregon]] Crook's men caught the [[Northern Paiute people|Paiutes]] asleep in their camp.<ref name=Michno211>Michno 2003, p.211</ref>  However, after the first shots were fired, [[Chief Howluck]] determined to stay and fight.  The native warriors taunted the soldiers, who returned a deadly accurate fire on the warriors.  Quickly into the fighting almost every mounted warrior was shot down.  The rest sought refuge behind rocks, remaining there until mid-day when they retreated.<ref name=Michno2007>Michno 2007, p.194</ref>  Continuing his pursuit Crook again encountered the [[Chief Paulina]]'s Paiute village at [[Steens Mountain|Steen's Mountain]] (named after an early officer of the 1st Dragoons).  As Crook ordered the charge his horse bolted and carried him through the native village.<ref name=Michno130>Michno 2003, p.194</ref>  Nevertheless, his men followed.  Despite several close calls for Crook personally, his troopers' fire was accurate and inflicted heavy casualties.  A month later Crook's men engaged in one final skirmish before Crook ended the expedition due to bad weather.\n\nOn the nights of 7\u20138 February 1867, 25 men of Company B on a patrol were attacked by hostile Indians near [[Vicksburg Mines]] in Nevada.  On 5 April 1868, Company F killed 32 Indians and captured two near [[Malheur River]], Oregon.  Following the Indians south into California, Crook's 1st Cavalry troopers, along with infantrymen from the [[23rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|23rd Infantry Regiment]] and 15 Warm Springs and [[Shoshone]] scouts encountered a large band of them in an entrenched position. The Native American warriors had made a fortress out of [[lava rock]]s in the [[Infernal Caverns]] of northern California near the town of [[Likely, California|Likely]].<ref name=Michno211>Michno 2003, p.211</ref>  From there they were able to pour a steady fire upon the soldiers commanded by Lt. Col. [[George Crook]].  Crook's men attacked on the second day.  Despite heavy casualties they managed to scale the cliffs and take the fortifications.  Colonel Crook reportedly shot down Chief Sieto himself.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.farwestern.com/crookscanyon/page08.htm |title=Place of Many Soldiers p. 8 |access-date=28 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303050654/http://www.farwestern.com/crookscanyon/page08.htm |archive-date=3 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Fighting continued into the night as the Native warriors withdrew deeper into the caverns. Crook commented \"I never wanted dynamite so bad as I did when we first took the fort and heard the diabolical and defiant yells from down in the rocks\". On the third day the Natives had fled the caverns.\n\n====1866\u20131871====\nThey also fought in the [[Apache Wars]] in [[Arizona Territory]] from 1866 to 1872. On 29 January 1867, Company M encountered a band of 90 warriors at Stein's Mountain in [[New Mexico Territory]]; 60 Indians were killed and 27 captured. From 26 to 31 May 1868, eight men of Company M killed 34 Indians. At [[Fort McDowell, Arizona|Fort McDowell]] in Arizona on 9\u201311 December 1869, 20 men from Company E killed an entire band of 11 [[Yavapai people|Mojave Apaches]].\n\nOn 15 December 1870, Colonel Blake was retired from active service on his own application, and Colonel [[Alvan C. Gillem]] of the 11th Infantry was transferred to the First Cavalry in his stead.\n\n====Modoc War====\n{{Main|Modoc War}}\nThe [[Modoc people|Modoc Indians]] were a small tribe living in northern California near [[Tule Lake]] and [[Lost River (California)|Lost River]]. Through the intercession of interested civilians, orders were issued for the Modocs removal to the Klamath Indian Reservation. They went on the reservation, but, on account of ill treatment, left it, and the War Department was then directed to enforce the orders. The Indians at once commenced hostilities and one of the most protracted and obstinate Indian wars of later years followed.\n\nCompany B left [[Fort Klamath]], on 28 November 1872, for the purpose of arresting \"Captain Jack\" and the leaders of his band of Modocs, and at daylight on 29 November surprised the Indians in their camp near the Lost River. The Indians refused to surrender and an engagement followed in which eight Indians were killed and many wounded, and the camp, squaws, and property were captured. The company lost two men killed and six wounded, two of them mortally. The company then went into camp at Crowley's Ranch on Lost River opposite the Indian camp.\n\nCompany G from Fort Bidwell took station on 13 December at Land's Ranch, Tule Lake, near the Indian stronghold. The Indians attacked this camp on 21 December, and were repulsed, but not until two men and five horses had been killed. Company B now joined Company G and the two companies marched against the Indians on 16 January 1873 in conjunction with General Wheaton's column, with which Company F and a detachment of Company H were also serving at this time. The Indians attacked Companies B and G the same afternoon, but were repulsed, the companies losing three men wounded. The general engagement took place on 17 January, and lasted from 7.30 A.M. to 9.30 P.M., when the troops retired, going finally into camp at Applegate's Ranch near [[Clear Lake Reservoir|Clear Lake]]. The regiment lost two men killed and two officers, \u2013 Captain Perry and Lieutenant Kyle, \u2013 and eight men wounded, one mortally.\n\nThe Indians attacked a wagon train on 22 January, driving away the escort. However, Captain [[Reuben F. Bernard]], 1st Cavalry, came up with reinforcements and the Indians were repulsed, losing one killed and many wounded. Company K from Fort Halleck, Nev., joined the battalion on 18 February. The battalion now consisted of Companies B, F, G and K, under Captain Biddle, who was soon succeeded by Captain Bernard. Colonel Gillem, 1st Cavalry was commanding the expedition, and Company H joined the column on 10 February.\n\nDuring the night of 14 April, the companies of the 1st Cavalry moved with the rest of the command to invest the Modoc stronghold, and in the [[Second Battle of the Stronghold]], 15\u201317 April, drove the Indians out of their position and into the rocks and mountains. The 1st Cavalry lost two men killed and two wounded. On 26 April, Companies B and F went to the scene of the \"Thomas massacre\" and brought off a number of the wounded and dead. The same companies were attacked by Indians on 10 May, at Sorass Lake, California, but repulsed them with the loss of one warrior killed and two wounded. The command lost one killed and six wounded, two of them mortally. On 17 May, Companies B, G and K, with a battery (serving as cavalry) of the 4th Artillery, all under Major John Green, came upon a band of Modocs, which they drove five miles, killing one and capturing several squaws and children. The troops followed the trail and on 22 May, 70 Indians \u2013 men, women and children \u2013 surrendered. \"Boston Charlie\" was captured on 29 May, and on 31 May \"Sconchin\", \"Scarfaced Charlie\", and 27 other Indians surrendered.\n\nCompanies F and H were sent from Applegate's Ranch on 31 May to follow up on those Modocs who had eluded Green's command, finding them on 1 June, when the whole party surrendered. With the capture of \"Captain Jack\", the Modoc war ended, and by the end of June the companies that had been engaged in it had returned to their proper stations.\n\nThe companies left in Arizona were moved north, and by the end of October 1873, headquarters with Companies A and D were at Benicia Barracks; B at Fort Klamath; C at Camp McDermitt, Nev.; E at Fort Lapwai, Idaho Territory -, F, L and M at Fort Walla Walla, Wyoming Territory; G at Camp Bidwell, California.; H and K at [[Camp Harney]], Oregon.; and I at Camp Halleck, Nevada.\n\nColonel Gillem died at his residence in [[Nashville]], Tenn., 2 December 1875, and was succeeded by Colonel [[Cuvier Grover]], promoted from the 3rd Cavalry.\n\n====1877 Nez Perce War====\n{{Main|Nez Perce War}}\nOn 15 June 1877, Companies F and H, under Captain Perry, were ordered to proceed to Camas Prairie to the assistance of the settlers of Mount Idaho, I. T., who were threatened by the Nez Perc\u00e9 Indians under Chief Joseph. Learning that the Indians were crossing Salmon River and could be taken at a disadvantage, the march was given that direction and Chief Joseph's camp was found and taken by surprise, but the Indians quickly rallied and repulsed the troops with severe loss, Lieutenant E. W. Theller, 21st Infantry (attached), and 33 men being killed and two wounded.\n\nAll the companies of the regiment, except M at [[Fort Colville]] and A at Camp Harney watching the Piutes, were now ordered into the field against the Nez Perc\u00e9s. Companies E and L joined General Howard's command on 21 June; and on 1 July they surprised and attacked the camp of \"Looking Glass\" on the Clearwater, I. T. The village was entirely destroyed, several Indians killed and about 1,000 ponies captured. On 2 July, the same command attempted to form a junction with Company F, which was on its way from Lapwai. On 3 July, the Indians ambushed the advanced guard, consisting of Lieutenant S. M. Rains, ten men of the battalion and two civilian scouts, killing them all, and were then found to be in such force and so strongly posted that it was considered imprudent to attack them. The junction with Company F was effected, however, on 4 July, and the same afternoon the Indians attacked, the fight lasting until sunset. The battalion (E, F and L) joined General Howard at Grangerville, on 8 July. Company H had joined on 2 July, and the battalion was commanded by Captain David Perry.\n\nOn 11 July, General Howard crossed the Clearwater with his whole command and moved down that stream with Company H in advance. The Indian camp was discovered and at once attacked, the fight lasting two days and ending with the retreat of the Indians. Company B joined in time to take part in the fight on 12 July. The regiment lost three men killed and four wounded. The battalion made a reconnaissance on 18 July of the Lo-Lo trail, and the Indian scouts accompanying it were ambushed and met with considerable loss. One Nez Perc\u00e9 was killed.\n\nMajor Sanford's battalion, consisting of Companies C, D, I and K, joined General Howard on the Clearwater, on 28 July, and the expedition across the Lo-Lo trail began on 30 July. Companies B, C, I and K, under Major Sanford, accompanied it, and Companies D, E, G and L, with other troops under Major Green, constituted the \"Reserve Column\", which remained at Camas Prairie until 5 August, when it moved near to Mount Idaho, and established a permanent camp called Camp Howard. Companies F and H were stationed at [[Fort Lapwai]].\n\nIn the Indian attack at Camas Creek on 20 August, Companies B and L were engaged, losing one man killed and one wounded. At Judith Basin, the battalion was detached from General Howard's command and directed to return, and all the companies had reached their stations by the end of November. Company K and a detachment of C, attached to General Sturgis' command, took part in the engagement with the Nez Perc\u00e9s at Canyon Creek, Montana, on 13 September 1877.\n\n====1878====\n{{Main|Bannock War}}\nAt the outbreak of the [[Bannock War]] in May 1878, Company G was the first body of troops to reach the scene of hostilities, and Captain Bernard reported that the Indians numbered from 300 to 500. They were moving towards [[Steens Mountain]] (named after [[Enoch Steen]], a former member of the regiment). The whole of the First Cavalry was at once ordered into the field and Colonel Grover sent to Fort Boise to take charge of operations there. Companies D, I and K, were with him. Companies F and L joined Company G on the Owyhee, 17 June, and the three companies reached Camp Harney on 21 June, where they were joined by Company A. These four companies were designated the \"Left Column\" by General Howard.\n\nOn the morning of 23 June, the Left Column struck the main camp of the hostiles on Silver Creek, and drove the Indians out of it and on to a cutbank, made by the creek, which had been prepared for defense. The action lasted into the night and in the morning it was found that the Indians had gone. Many Indians were killed and the camp was destroyed. The battalion lost two killed and three wounded. Company K joined the battalion on 27 June, and on 28 June the cavalry cut loose from the foot troops and pushed forward on the trail of the Indians. The fertile John Day Valley was saved in great part by this vigorous pursuit, and on 5 July General Howard overtook the command, arriving with it at Pilot Rock on 7 July. Here, it was joined by Companies E and H. The Indian camp was located and at sunrise on 8 July Captain Bernard moved his battalion to the attack.\n\nAbout 300 Indians occupied the crest of the high and steep hills near Birch Creek, and were at once attacked. Captain Bernard fought his cavalry on foot without separating the men from the horses. All the companies, except A with the pack train, were deployed and used in the engagement, and the Indians were driven from three successive positions and finally four or five miles further into the mountains. Four men were wounded, one mortally, and probably 20 horses were killed. The enemy's loss is unknown; their women, children and best horses were sent off, seemingly towards the Grande Ronde, before the action began.\n\n[[Charles Erskine Scott Wood|Lieutenant C. E. S. Wood, A. D. C.]], wrote: \"The entire fight was closely watched by the general commanding, who desires to express his opinion that no troops ever behaved better or in a more soldierly manner than did the officers and men engaged in this encounter.\" The command camped for the night among the rough ca\u00f1ons adjacent to the battle-field.\n\nCaptain Bernard was then ordered to take his command, except Company K, to Fort Walla Walla to refit. Company K was sent to join the infantry column and with it moved to the Umatilla Agency, near which the hostiles were reported to be. Here the Indians attacked on 13 July. In the ensuing fight, Company K held the right of the line and took part in the final charge by which the Indians were driven off the field and for three miles into the hills. At the request of the Indian Agent, the command moved back to the agency that night, but two days later seven dead Indians were counted upon the battle-field.\n\nCompanies A, E, F, G, H and I, now under Lieutenant-Colonel J. W. Forsyth, 1st Cavalry, left Fort Walla Walla on 13 July \u2013 the day of the fight at Umatilla Agency \u2013 in search of the Indians, who were found to be travelling in the direction of John Day River. On 20 July, Forsyth's scouts were ambushed, which caused a halt and deployment of the command, but when the line moved forward the Indians had gone. On 22 July, the battalion reached 11 Burnt Meadows, where it was joined by Companies D and I, under Major Sanford, and on 27 July it went into camp at Malheur Agency to await supplies. The hostiles had now split up into many small parties, which were followed up and nearly all ultimately captured.\n\nDuring the months of September and October, the companies were sent to their permanent stations, and the return for 30 November shows Companies A and E at Camp Harney, Oregon; B, D, F, K and M, at Fort Walla Walla, W. T.; C at Camp Bidwell, California; G at Fort Boise, L T.; H at Fort Colville, W. T.; I at Camp Halleck, Nevada, and L at Fort Klamath, Oregon.\n\n====1881====\nIn 1881, Companies C, G, I and M were sent to Arizona, and on 2 October, Company G, with other troops, was in action near Cedar Springs against Apaches. The hostiles fought with great boldness and desperation and the fight lasted until 9 P. M., when the Indians escaped. Company G had two men wounded and 12 horses killed. On 4 October, Companies G and I had a running fight near South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains, in which the hostiles were followed into Sonora, Mexico.\n\nIn October 1881, the \"companies\" began to be designated \"troops\" on the Regimental Return. Troop G returned to Fort McDermott on 9 November; Troop I to Camp Halleck on 27 December; Troop M to the Presidio of San Francisco on 20 January 1882; and Troop C to Fort Bidwell on 16 April.\n\n====1884\u201387====\nIn June 1884, the regiment was transferred to the Department of Dakota, after a tour of nearly 30 years on the Pacific coast, during the greater part of which time its stations were remote from civilization and its duties of a most arduous and thankless character. On 5 June 1885, Colonel Grover died at Atlantic City, New Jersey and was succeeded by Colonel N. A. M. Dudley, promoted from the 9th Cavalry.\n\nDuring this time, the headquarters and troops D, G, I, K and M, went to Fort Custer; A, C and F went to Fort Maginnis; E to Fort Ellis; H and L to Fort Assinniboine; and B to Fort Keogh.\n\nFrom 1886 to 1918, Company M, 1st Cavalry was stationed at [[Fort Yellowstone]].\n\nConflict with the \"Crows\" came in the fall of 1887, and on the morning of 4 November, Colonel Dudley left Fort Custer with Troops A, B, D, E, G and K, and Company B, 3d Infantry, with a section of Hotchkiss guns, to arrest \"Sword Bearer\" and the Indians who had fired into the agency buildings on the night of 30 September.\n\nOn 5 November, a demand was made upon the Indians for the surrender of these men, and they were given an hour and a half to comply with the demand. At the end of that time, the battalion of the 1st Cavalry, with Moylan's troop of the 7th Cavalry on the right, moved out in front of camp. At the same time, a 'great commotion was observed in the Indian camp, and \"Sword Bearer\" and another chief dashed out leading from 120 to 150 warriors equipped for battle. The Indians charged, but were repulsed and fell back into the timber alongside the river, where they had dug many rifle pits from which they now kept up a constant fire. This fire was returned, and \"Sword Bearer\" was seen to fall, whereupon all fighting quickly ceased. All the Indians whose surrender had been demanded and who had not been killed were at once brought in and delivered to the Department Commander, who sent them to Fort Snelling. The cavalry battalion returned to Fort Custer on 13 November.\n\n====1889\u20131892====\nColonel Dudley was retired from active service on 20 August 1889, and was succeeded by Colonel [[J. S. Brisbin]], promoted from the 9th Cavalry. On 31 December, Headquarters and Troops B, D, E, G and M, were at Fort Custer; A and L at [[Fort Maginnis]]; C, F and H at [[Fort Assinniboine]]; I at [[Fort Leavenworth]]; and K at Camp Sheridan, [[Wyoming]].\n\nIn April 1890, the [[Cheyennes]] assumed a threatening attitude and their agent called on the commanding officer of Fort Custer for protection, who sent Major Carrol with Troops B, D and M to the [[Tongue River Agency]], where they established [[Camp Crook (Montana)|Camp Crook]]. In September, a white boy was murdered by \"Head Chief\" and \"Young Mule\", and every attempt to arrest the murderers failed. On 11 April, the Indians sent word that they would attack the agency and on 12 April made their appearance on a hill commanding the agency buildings, where they opened fire upon them. They were soon dislodged and killed. The regiment took part in the operations against the hostile Sioux in the winter of 1890\u20131891, but was not brought into actual contact with them.\n\nIn December 1890, word having been received that a troop of cavalry was surrounded by hostile Indians at or near Cave Hills, Montana, Troop A made one of the most remarkable marches on record in going to its relief. It marched 186 miles, 95 of which were made in 25 hours, and 170 in 53\u00bd hours. The report that caused such tremendous exertion proved to be without foundation.\n\nOn 22 April 1891, Colonel Brisbin was transferred to the [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry]] with Colonel [[Abraham K. Arnold]] who had been the lieutenant colonel and now became the colonel of the First. In 1892, the regiment was transferred to the Department of [[Arizona]], relieving the 10th Cavalry. Headquarters and Troops C, E, F, H and K, going to [[Fort Grant]], Arizona.; B and I to [[Fort Bayard Historic District|Fort Bayard]], [[New Mexico]]; D to [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation|Fort Apache]], Arizona; and G to [[San Carlos, Arizona|San Carlos]]. Troop A was at [[Fort Myer]], [[Virginia]], and was not moved.\n\n====Medals of Honor====\n\nOwing to the vast extent of country guarded by the regiment, its service for many years following was very arduous. Scouting for Indians and escort duty of various kinds were incessant. During this period, 30 soldiers and officers serving with the regiment earned the [[Medal of Honor]]. Eighteen of these awards were for a single engagement against Apaches in the [[Chiricahua Mountains]] of Arizona, and another six were for actions in [[George Crook]]'s \"winter campaign\" of 1872\u201373. The recipients were:<ref name=\"moh\"/>\n\n=====Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona, 20 October 1869=====\n* Sergeant [[Frederick Jarvis]], Company G\n* Trumpeter [[Bartholomew T.

After the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}} exploded in [[Havana Harbor]], the fires of war brewed and the 1st Cavalry was moved to Chickamauga Park, [[Tennessee]] on 24 April 1898.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  The 1st Cavalry and the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]] were formed into a cavalry [[brigade]] and shipped out to Cuba from [[Tampa, Florida]].  However, due to the limited space aboard the ''SS Leona'', the troopers were forced to leave their horses behind.  They fought in the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]] on 24 June, and at the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] from 1\u20133 July.  During the [[Siege of Santiago]], the 1st Cavalry Regiment earned its 61st battle honor.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  The 1st Cavalry remained in [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]] until 8 August, and returned to the US where they were garrisoned at Fort Riley, Kansas, then later at [[Fort Robinson]], Nebraska.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\n===The Philippines and border duty===\nOn 19 June 1899, the 1st Cavalry left Ft Robinson for [[Fort D.A. Russell (Wyoming)|Fort D.A. Russell]], [[Wyoming]] and began thorough training for new recruits after a brief reorganization period.  When the [[Boxer Rebellion]] began in China in August 1899, the US Army garrison in the [[Philippines]] was moved to [[Peking]] to relieve the surrounded legations there, and the 1st Cavalry was sent to the Philippines on 7 August, their horses following four days later.  Arriving at [[Batangas]], [[Luzon]] on 20 September, they moved to [[Santo Tomas, Batangas|Santo Tomas]] just south of [[Manila]].  They busied themselves with scouting missions, escorting supplies, and patrolling the countryside and villages for guerrilla fighters.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nIn October 1901, a group of insurgents stole some native supplies, so 20 troopers pursued them, reclaimed the goods, and burned the village they were found in, and on 22 October, Troop B captured 5 guerrillas on [[Mount Makiling]].  From 18 November-1 December, 35 troopers from the 1st Cavalry took part in the [[Mount San Cristobal]] Expedition, which destroyed an enemy supply cache.  On 15 March 1902, Troop B killed 5 insurgents on Mount Makiling, and killed 4 more on 19 March.  On 16 April, the leader of these guerrillas, General Malvar, surrendered, and hostilities ceased.  The 1st Cavalry Regiment was sent back home, and arrived at their new post, [[Fort Clark, Texas]], on 1 October 1903, where they remained for three years.  After the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], 1st Cavalry troopers moved there to assist, and Troop B remained in San Francisco until 9 June 1907 before returning to [[Texas]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nThe 1st Cavalry Regiment returned to the Philippines in 1908 and garrisoned [[Fort Stotsenburg]] for two years.  This deployment was much quieter than their last one, and the regiment returned home on 12 February 1910.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  A, B, D, and K Troops were stationed at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] and later joined the rest of their regiment at the [[Presidio of Monterey]] until 1 August 1914.  Moving to [[Southern California]], the 1st Cavalry garrisoned [[San Ysidro]] in response to growing tensions south of the border in [[Mexico]].  On 24 August 1915, the regiment moved to [[Calexico, California]] to strengthen the border and defend against raids by the ''bandito'', [[Pancho Villa]].  They remained guarding the border while [[General Pershing]] launched the [[Pancho Villa Expedition|Punitive Expedition]] and were still there when the US entered World War I.  The 1st Cavalry did not participate in the First World War, but it remained guarding the border until 19 January 1923, when they went to [[Fort D. A. Russell (Texas)|Fort D. A. Russell, Texas]].  This was their last posting as horse cavalry, and during a parade on 14 December 1932, the troopers dismounted and passed in review, saluting their horses as they left them to become a mechanized unit.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  Moving to [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]], the 1st Cavalry Regiment became the first mechanized unit in the United States Army, and was brigaded with the [[13th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|13th Cavalry Regiment]] to form the [[7th Cavalry Brigade (United States)|7th Cavalry Brigade (Mecz)]].  In the summer of 1939, 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mecz) took part in the [[Plattsburg]] Maneuvers and helped develop the Army's first tactics for mechanized warfare.  In the summer of 1940, the [[Louisiana]] Maneuvers convinced the Army of the need to form an armored force and the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] was founded on 15 July 1940.  The 1st Cavalry Regiment was redesignated the 1st Armored Regiment that same day, and was assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>.  It wouldn't be long until America's fledgling armored force would be tested in battle.\n\n===World War II===\nThe 1st Armored Division was one of the first American units to sail across the [[Atlantic]] to do battle with the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. Leaving from [[Fort Dix, New Jersey]] on 11 April 1942, the Old Ironsides patch set foot on European soil in [[Northern Ireland]] on 16 May 1942. Here, they trained with a new intensity as they prepared to go into battle for the first time. \n\n====Algeria-French Morocco====\nOnce the United States entered World War II on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], the Army began rigorous training and reorganization to prepare for combat against the [[Axis powers|Axis]].  The 1st Armored Regiment, part of the 1st Armored Division, was one of the first American units to engage in combat in World War II in the [[North African Campaign]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  On 8 November 1942, the 1st Armored Regiment landed at [[St Leu]], [[French Morocco]] and captured [[Tafaraoui Airfield]] later in the day after overrunning a battery of [[Vichy French]] guns.  The next day, the regiment fought well against a counterattack by French tanks and managed to destroy 14 French [[Renault R35|R35]] tanks, for the loss of 1 US tank and 1 US KIA.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nAfter defeating the Vichy French forces in [[Operation Torch]], the 1st Armored Regiment began its fight against the [[Wehrmacht]] in [[Tunisia]].  In one engagement against a combined German-[[Royal Italian Army during World War II|Italian]] force, \"A\" Company lost six tanks but managed to draw the enemy's fire, allowing \"B\" Company to fire into the enemy's vulnerable rear, knocking out six [[Panzer IV]]s and one [[Panzer III]] before the rest retreated.  Two miles to the north, Axis infantry was observed dismounting from vehicles and the remaining tanks of Companies A and B advanced on them and destroyed the enemy force.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nIn November 1943, the 1st Armored Regiment, as a part of the 1st Armored Division, moved to Italy and fought in the [[Naples-Foggia Campaign]], the Allied drive to [[Monte Cassino]].  The winter months in Italy were mired in mud and stalemate.  The rains and stiff German resistance on river and mountain-top defensive lines halted Allied progress.  In late January 1944, the 1st Armored Regiment landed in [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]] as part of the Allied operation to outflank the German [[Winter Line]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>  The armored forces broke through the German encirclement on 24 May 1944 after heavy fighting.  After participating in the liberation of Rome on 5 June 1944, the 1st Armored Division was pulled off the frontline and reorganized under a new table of organization.  The 1st Armored Regiment was redesignated as the 1st Tank Battalion.  The division was placed back onto the line and the 1st Tank Battalion steadily [[Trasimene Line|advanced north]] and crossed the [[Arno]] on 1 September.  This river crossing was followed by bloody stalemate in the [[Gothic Line|North Apennines]], where the rough and cold terrain hindered tank operations.  Their final action in the Second World War was the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Po Valley Campaign]], where they fought from 21\u201326 April 1945.  The 1st Tank Battalion was deactivated after [[VE Day]].<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nWhen the [[Korean War]] began, the Army began re-mobilizing.  1st Battalion, 1st Armored Regiment was reactivated as the 1st Tank Battalion at [[Fort Hood]], Texas and 2nd Battalion, 1st Armored Regiment was activated as the 100th Tank Battalion and trained until they were combined together on 15 February 1957 at [[Fort Polk]], [[Louisiana]] to reform the 1st Cavalry Regiment.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\n===Vietnam===\nIn August 1967, the [[1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment]] (1-1 Cavalry) was detached from the 1st Armored Division and sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] attached to [[US Army Pacific]]. On deployment to Vietnam in 1967, the squadron consisted of three armored cavalry troops and one air cavalry troop, D Troop, which was not deployed until July 1968. 'D' Troop, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment was shipped to Vietnam with its aircraft to join its parent unit, which was already in Vietnam attached to the [[23rd Infantry Division (United States)|Americal Division]] at Chu Lai. En route, D Troop's orders were changed, temporarily attaching it to the [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne Division]]. The troop disembarked at Da Nang on 21 July 1968 and flew directly to [[Camp Eagle (Vietnam)|Camp Eagle]]. The Troop then remained on combat duty in I Corps for the next four years and used the call sign Sabre. 1-1 Cavalry served in [[Chu Lai Base Area|Chu Lai]], [[\u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng]], [[Tam K\u1ef3 Base Camp|Tam K\u1ef3]], and Thach Khe. On 15 April 1966 Troop E, 1st Cavalry was activated as the brigade reconnaissance troop of the 11th Infantry Brigade at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. Troop E arrived in Vietnam on 19 December 1967 and participated in extensive ground combat in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i and Quang Tin provinces through eleven campaigns, receiving the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry for service in 1969\u20131970 with the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 23rd Infantry Division (Americal). Troop E was inactivated in Vietnam on 13 November 1971. They departed Vietnam on 10 May 1972.<ref name=\"macspics.homestead.com\"/>\n\nOn 1 July 1963, the 2nd Squadron, 1st Cavalry was relieved of their duties to the [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]], United States Army, Europe and reassigned to the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] at [[Fort Hood]], Texas. On 8 August 1967, the unit left Fort Hood for Vietnam where they were attached to the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]], headquartered in [[Pleiku]]. During their service in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]], troopers saw action in Pleiku, [[\u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4 Base Camp|\u0110\u1eafk T\u00f4]], [[Suoi Doi]], [[Kon Tum]], [[Camp Radcliff|An Kh\u00ea]] and many other nameless stretches of road and jungle.  In May 1969, the squadron was transferred to Task Force South in [[Firebase Betty|Phan Thi\u1ebft]] and was attached to the 1st Field Force, Vietnam. Now operating in the rice paddies and rubber plantations of Vietnam, the Blackhawks further distinguished themselves in actions around Phan Thi\u1ebft, [[Song Mao Base Camp|Song Mao]], [[Phan Rang]] and their environs.  2-1 Cavalry departed Vietnam in October 1970, leaving [[Cam Ranh Bay]] for reassignment to the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas.\n\n7th Squadron (Air), 1st Cavalry was a self-contained Vietnam-era air cavalry squadron, made up of five troops. Headquarters and Headquarters Troop (callsign Kingbird/Blackhawk), Alpha Troop (callsign Apache), Bravo Troop (callsign Dutch Master), Charlie Troop (callsign Sand Piper/Comanche) and Delta Troop (Powder Valley/Dragoon). D Troop (the squadron's armored cavalry troop) participated in successful night ambushes, escorted convoys, search and clear missions and other ground operations until the U.S. 9th Div was withdrawn from Vietnam. After that the offensive mission of D Troop was taken away and they were used to train the South Vietnamese [[South Vietnamese Regional Forces|Regional Force]] infantry units of the 44th Special Zone (STZ) in air assault missions, which were quite successful. The 44th STZ protected a region along the Cambodian border to the north.  Troops A, B and C were [[Air Cavalry]] units. When the U.S. 9th Division was returned to the US, their Air Cavalry Troop, D/3 3-5th Cav, was added to the 7-1st Cav, bringing the number of Air Cavalry Troops to 4. This was the largest Air Cav Squadron in Vietnam. Equipped to perform scout, insertion, interdiction and attack missions, the troops supported the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) [[21st Division (South Vietnam)|21st]], [[9th Division (South Vietnam)|9th]], [[7th Division (South Vietnam)|7th Division]]s and the 44 STZ. The Squadron was initially attached to the 12th Aviation Group, then from 3 June 1968, to the 164th Aviation Group.
