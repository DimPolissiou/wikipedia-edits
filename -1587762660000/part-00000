Music is given by [[Roshan (music director)|Roshan]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nClassmates Rajesh and Manju are in love with each other and their marriage is on card. But Manju's rich neighbor Jwalaprasad's daughter Lata, a spoiled lady, also wants to marry Rajesh. Manju's father falls ill of a stomach tumor, but she does not have the Rs.5000 required for an operation. Unfortunately, Rajesh is out of station for some work. She goes to Jwalaprasad for help and finds his wife at home, who gives her money, but on a condition. Manju should accept unmarried Lata's illicit child as her own and should never disclose the truth to anyone. Helpless, Manju agrees. But that money could not save her father, who succumbs to his illness. Manju leaves the vicinity. Rajesh finds her after a couple of years with the kid and accuses her of deceiving him. He turns alcoholic. Jwalaprasad finds Manju and brings her at his home to serve Mrs. Jwalaprasad, who is a mute handicapped now because of an accident. Jwalaprasad asks Manju to convince Rajesh to marry Lata. Upon Manju's insistence, Rajesh agrees. During the marriage rituals, Lata's house catches fire and Lata & her kid are trapped in. Rajesh saves them, but Lata dies of an injury when she tries to stop Rajesh. Shocked, Mrs. Jwalaprasad regains her voice and tells all about her atrocities on Manju, to everyone. Rajesh and Manju are united again.\n\n==Music==\n[[Roshan]] composed music for the film's songs, which were written by [[Shakeel Badayuni]].

One of these roles was opposite his first wife, [[Jennifer Jones]], in the World War II epic ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944). He also played [[Jerome Kern]] in ''Till the Clouds Roll By''. Twice divorced by 30, he suffered from [[alcoholism]] and [[mental illness]], which were exacerbated by his painful separation and divorce from Jones.<ref>Linet, pp, 139-186, 229-232</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWalker was born in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Emotionally scarred by his parents' divorce when he was still a child, he subsequently developed an interest in acting, which led his maternal aunt, [[Hortense Odlum|Hortense McQuarrie Odlum]] (then the president of [[Bonwit Teller]]), to offer to pay for his enrollment at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York City in 1937. Walker lived in her home during his first year in the city.\n\n==Career and personal life==\nWhile attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Walker met fellow aspiring actress Phylis Isley, who later took the stage name [[Jennifer Jones]]. After a brief courtship, the couple married in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], on January 2, 1939. Walker had some small unbilled parts in films like ''[[Winter Carnival (film)|Winter Carnival]]'' (1939), and two [[Lana Turner]] films at MGM ''[[These Glamour Girls]]'' (1939) and ''[[Dancing Co-Ed]]'' (1939).  \n\n===Radio===\nWalker found work in radio while Isley stayed home and gave birth to two sons in quick succession - actor [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1940)|Robert Walker Jr.]] (1940 - 2019) and Michael Walker (1941 \u2013 2007). \n\nWalker co-starred in the weekly show ''[[Maudie Mason|Maudie's Diary]]'' from August 1941 to September 1942.<ref name=\"Dunning\">{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn |url-access= registration |quote= Maudie's Diary, light comedy. |last=Dunning |first=John |authorlink=John Dunning (detective fiction author) |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-507678-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/442 442]-443 |edition=Revised |accessdate=2019-10-04}}</ref> Isley then returned to auditioning where her luck changed when she was discovered in 1941 by producer [[David O.

Both were notable commercial successes.\n\n====Stardom====\nWalker's charming demeanor and boyish good looks caught on with audiences, and he was promoted to stardom with the title part in as the [[Boy next door (stock character)|\"boy-next-door\"]] soldier in ''[[See Here, Private Hargrove (film)|See Here, Private Hargrove]]'' (1944).\n\nHe also appeared in Selznick's ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944), in which he and his  fianc\u00e9 portrayed doomed young lovers during [[World War II]]. By that time, Jones' affair with Selznick was common knowledge, and Jones and Walker separated in November 1943, in mid-production.<ref>\"Jennifer Jones Sues To Divorce Actor Walker\", ''The Washington Post'', April 22, 1945, p. M4.</ref> The filming of their love scenes was torturous as Selznick insisted that Walker perform take after take of each love scene with Jones. She filed for divorce in April 1945.

One of these roles was opposite his first wife, [[Jennifer Jones]], in the World War II epic ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944). He also played [[Jerome Kern]] in ''Till the Clouds Roll By''. Twice divorced by 30, he suffered from [[alcoholism]] and [[mental illness]], which were exacerbated by his painful separation and divorce from Jones.<ref>Linet, pp, 139-186, 229-232</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWalker was born in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Emotionally scarred by his parents' divorce when he was still a child, he subsequently developed an interest in acting, which led his maternal aunt, [[Hortense Odlum|Hortense McQuarrie Odlum]] (then the president of [[Bonwit Teller]]), to offer to pay for his enrollment at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York City in 1937. Walker lived in her home during his first year in the city.\n\n==Career and personal life==\nWhile attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Walker met fellow aspiring actress Phylis Isley, who later took the stage name [[Jennifer Jones]]. After a brief courtship, the couple married in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], on January 2, 1939. Walker had some small unbilled parts in films like ''[[Winter Carnival (film)|Winter Carnival]]'' (1939), and two [[Lana Turner]] films at MGM ''[[These Glamour Girls]]'' (1939) and ''[[Dancing Co-Ed]]'' (1939).  \n\n===Radio===\nWalker found work in radio while Isley stayed home and gave birth to two sons in quick succession - actor [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1940)|Robert Walker Jr.]] (1940 - 2019) and Michael Walker (1941 \u2013 2007). \n\nWalker co-starred in the weekly show ''[[Maudie Mason|Maudie's Diary]]'' from August 1941 to September 1942.<ref name=\"Dunning\">{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn |url-access= registration |quote= Maudie's Diary, light comedy. |last=Dunning |first=John |authorlink=John Dunning (detective fiction author) |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-507678-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/442 442]-443 |edition=Revised |accessdate=2019-10-04}}</ref> Isley then returned to auditioning where her luck changed when she was discovered in 1941 by producer [[David O.

Both were notable commercial successes.\n\n====Stardom====\nWalker's charming demeanor and boyish good looks caught on with audiences, and he was promoted to stardom with the title part in as the [[Boy next door (stock character)|\"boy-next-door\"]] soldier in ''[[See Here, Private Hargrove (film)|See Here, Private Hargrove]]'' (1944).\n\nHe also appeared in Selznick's ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944), in which he and his  fianc\u00e9 portrayed doomed young lovers during [[World War II]].
